My husband and I are super picky about sushi... we care about freshness, originality, cost, and chef friendliness... This place has it all!  The ayce is really affordable and still offers original rolls/appetizers. They also will do a half roll so that you can try more things! Get the Japanese nachos, you won't be sorry!!",

Their sushi are made with the minimum amount of allowable rice by law a tell nd their is swift service and spot on flavors makes this place a MUST TRY!  The only bad thing that we experienced was the way they told us not to waste food.  They don't care if you can EAT, but just don't waste.  We were also guilty of that....but if you dine with my professional foodie, TOO MUCH is NEVER an issue.    So bring an empty stomach and allow Sakana to fill it up.  Their peach saki was the bomb!  So smooth and refreshing and at the CRAZY price of 2 for 1..... it was a no brainer.  We will be back!!!",

When he came back he said the cooks lost our order so we had to wait longer on our food Did not apologize nothing. When he finally brought our food the order was still incomplete and tried telling us that we never ordered the items mentioned. And didn't even offer a discount for losing out orders.. twice",

    "text": "On my last trip to Vegas a week ago (12/2016) I heard about this AYCE sushi place that was to die for. Checking on Yelp, I saw they have over 1400 reviews at 4.5 stars, so that was enough for me to round up a gang of 8 for an early dinner.   We arrived around 3:30ish, missing the lunch cut-off, so each had to pay an extra 5 bucks.  Lunch: $20.95 Dinner: $25.95  The place was half full. The decor was busy and some replica vintage items rest on shelves for an added touch. The ayce menu had many items and can be overwhelming, especially when the server has an impatient look on her face everytime she came by to tke our order. We were handed a sheet to mark our orders, but no explanations were given that even though the paper only lists round 1 & 2, we can actually order more if needed.   A few of us wanted hot water (because it was cold and it's better for digestion) but we were told they don't have hot water, only hot tea @ $1.50 / cup. Really? What do you use to make hot tea if you don't have hot water??   We ordered some sodas, and they brought out the wrong ones, so we had to flag another server down to have that corrected.   The rolls and nigiri we ordered were good, for the most part. (see my photos) The uni was subpar. It was runny, pale in color and had a weird texture, as if it's been dunked in water.   The freshwater eel was the highlight, as it tasted fresh w/ a semi-sweet sauce drizzled over it. We ordered some extra plates of this.   The food selection, flavor and portions (fish to rice ratio) earns them a 4, or even 4.5 for a few in our party, but the whole experience of dining there dropped it down.   Let me explain:  * After our first round was finished, no one ever came by to hand us an additional order sheet, menu or even ask if we needed anything. I had to go up to the cashier and grab it myself ... repeatedly. * The music selection was annoying. K-pop (Korean pop music) was blasting above our heads. This is obviously targeting a certain market, not the majority.  * Though I saw many kids in there, they played music videos with skanky girls in string bikinis shaking their thang. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but not really approriate for kids, no?  * A few of the servers were pleasant, but a couple of them plain looked pissed off whenever we asked for something. Perhaps they should work at DMV, they will fit right in.   Will we come back? No, not again as a big group. Though the food was pretty good, their lack of patience and explanation for first timers didn't sit well with me. In addition, lying to us about not having hot water and forcing us to pay for hot tea (which tasted like colored water) did not set a good impression for management, and also the annoying loud teenie bopper music selection didn't make for a comfortable dining environment, as we had trouble carrying on  conversations.   Food: solid 4+ Ambience/ Service: 2 Avg: 3",

During my first visit I was highly impressed by quality and freshness of the fish. Also loved the appetizers and deserts. Many AYCE spots lack on the desert menu while Sakana offered a few more options. Roll selection is great, from baked, to deep fried, to riceless, to hand rolls. Everything here was delicious. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful. She explained various dishes and was patient while we made our selections. She also checked on us pretty frequently. Our table was never empty! The restaurant was quite busy, we had a little bit of a wait. Typically happens with popular spots. All in all, I really enjoyed my meal here and left super stuffed. Great success!",

We drove all the way across town for this and it was well worth the drive.   I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and immediately psyched myself into being able to eat a meal fit for at least 3 people. Just order what sounds good to you because it was all so good! However, you must try the Super White Tuna nigiri!!! The fish itself melts in your mouth and gives a nice buttery feel. It is dressed with a creamy sauce that makes you want to just lick the plate. Second runner up is the Smoke Paprika Salmon! Whatever they do to that salmon makes it explode flavor in your mouth.   My favorite roll was the Bam Bam. I really like a refreshing roll and this one hit umami.   There was so much to try at Sakana, and I will definitely be back to try more. Oh, and the fish to rice ratio is insane! You get about twice as much fish to rice for the nigiri and the rolls are the perfect size to pop in your mouth.  They also offer unlimited mochi, honey toast and tiramisu for dessert. You must save room for dessert!",

This place is impossible.  And yet, somehow, it's only $25 AYCE.  NOT a buffet, I should add.  Am I being pranked?  Where's the video camera?  Are they going to hit me with a parking charge on my way out the door for $100??  I don't get it.  These kinds of places defy all reason (in a good way!).  So stop reading reviews--just go here and be done with it!  Hurry, before they change their minds.",

    "text": "This was my favorite AYCE sushi place in town. My husband & I would come at least every other month, if not once a month for the past 2 years. My last experience there was horrible & it was for my husband's 30th birthday.   We were sat at a table with rice on it & there was a huge clump of rice under the table. Our waiter was nice, however he was barely present because he seemed to be the only one waiting on the entire restaurant, which several girls that were part of the staff stood by the register laughing & talking the whole time we were there besides seating people when they came in. There was a short Hispanic man that came to put water in our glasses but we stopped him because we had Sprite. We asked him if we could please have 2 more cans of soda & he never brought them. I make AYCE simple because I always put my order on my notes in my cell phone, so they can easily just read it & copy but this is the first time my orders were consistently messed up. Wrong food being brought to our table & at least half of our orders never came.   Everything tasted good, except for the sushi donut & one of the fried rolls we received. The fried roll tasted like straight dirty oil & the sushi donut was difficult to eat because the rice was super soggy & stuck to the plate.   We do not live close to Sakana at all but we never mind making the drive. I'm so disappointed with this last experience that I think we'll just stick to the sushi spots on our side of town.",

    "text": "Amazing AYCE sushi joint! Whenever my friends and I decide to get AYCE sushi, I lower my standards significantly. That's understandable right? because you can't serve unlimited high-quality fish at an affordable price - it just doesn't make sense economically. But FORTUNATELY at this joint, that rule doesn't apply! The sushi here is actually pretty damn good. Yes it isn't as great as what you'd get in an omakase or an izakaya, but for an AYCE, this was hands-down one of the best fish I have been served. Oh and for the very competitive price, you also get access to some super \"rare\" items such as salmon belly, ocean trout nigiri, uni, and more. For you sushi newbies, these items are considered commodities and usually will cost you quite the penny if bought alone. Go ask how much two pieces of salmon trout nigiri costs at another sushi restaurant! But here it's included in the AYCE! Though understandably these rare items are limited to 1 per person but there are so many to choose from, you'll feel like a fancy schmancy sushi connoisseur at the end of your meal.  Seriously if you're feeling like indulging or stuffing your face in Vegas, skip the $40 buffets on the strip and come here. You'll get much better food and leave much more satisfied. At least that's what we did. Hoorah",

All the sushi are made to order. You get so much options. I would recommend getting all of the \"limited\"(1 per person) menu items because those were amazing. We came when they have a buy one get one free alcohol options as well. I would say pregame here before your clubbing night on the strip! haha!   Sashimi pieces were thick and the rice portion was just right. Rolls were amazing as well. Appetizer options were overwhelming! I was super happy and satisfied.

    "text": "One of the best AYCE Sushi places in Las Vegas.  I was very surprised how tasty their salmon is and how fresh it can be, seeing how Vegas is in the desert.  The variety is amazing, that I probably only got to taste about 1/9 of all the possible dishes they offer.  The reason why I give this a 5 star, which is very rare, is because of the salmon.  If you are a fan of salmon, I would totally recommend this place.  It is very surprising that a place like this can get fresh tasting Salmon in the middle of the desert.  The quantities of the dishes are also very reasonable.  However, I would not recommend any of the skewers.  I would say the skewer sections is one of the bigger let downs for this restaurant.  The meats were dry.  Other than that, the variety of food other than sushi was very tasteful.  Side note, don't get too stuffed if you want dessert.  The Deep Fried Ice Cream tasted very delicious to finish off a great meal.",

    "text": "Have you ever seen a bad infomercial? Have you ever been taken advantage of ? Have you ever been totally pump faked by a fundamentalist such as Tim Duncan for the San Antonio Spurs to your own dismay of an optical illusion?   Where do I begin ??? Oh boy ....  I went here the other night but didn't eat because the wait was 1.5 hours and the staff runs the line so slowly. Some gay guy crossed my name off the list twice and the staff did nothing about it. I don't know if that's his gay way of hitting on me but he almost ended up getting his lights knocked out, so fortunately I left before trouble ensued. They have no organization, no system, they kind of pick and choose who they want to seat and when they want to seat them. Oh what fun is this game. Literally 4-5 open tables just sitting there looking nice and empty for some hungry heathens to come devour some \"critically acclaimed\" sushi.  I am accustomed to vip service my entire life and  now I know how it feels to be in general pop or the guy trying to ditch the line but isn't trying to by a table at club Liv in Miami but thinks he knows a promoter but doesn't know the promoter only gets paid on bottles and you probably should have made it easier on everyone and just got the table. They make you wait forever. No one watches the list or assigns the next party. I have a better chance of calling next in the streets of Harlem with an all white roster and actually getting on the next game then getting selected for a table here. Literally I feel like the luck of powerball struck when my name was finally called after my famished body had endured a 1.5 hour stand - a - thorn. Worst part I was high and you'd think I'd be more chill but I was hungry af.  Okay two hours later we are seated ready to rumbleeeee.  The waitress has a nasty attitude, doesn't speak English, and gave us one menu. Gee, Thanks, I guess. So after I partnered up with my buddy G, as if it were story time or we were working on a group project huddled up. We realized we had two opportunities left in the evening to order so we spat out a hum-dinger of an order.  She delivered our sushi about 50% correct which is even a poor free throw percentage but I was so hungry I didn't give a fukk was just grateful for food at this time. Someone in line told me this place was better than Yama sushi. Yama sushi is best in Vegas! Best service, food, quality, & price. Has 4 locations who can quickly seat you and accommodate high traffic times.  After what I would call a mediocre slab of sushi the waitress gave us a sideline warning and said we would be charged for not eating the rice. After our stomachs had failed us we left one roll. This hating ass biatch charged us 15$ for an additional two rolls. You literally have to get a manager involved if you would like a refill. Like sorry we are in the desert it's dry out here, do your job and get me some water.  Since she tacked me on the front 9 I happily left her what she earned which was a $0 dollar tip. Be nice to your customers, especially first timers who came to visit on their birthday and just waited 1.5 hours. I work hard for my money and your not entitled to my money because you have a store front sushi restaurant and a couple good yelp reviews, which were probably purchased by the way.  Never coming back ! Yama sushi is the champion of this town!",

I'd like give you all a huge bear hug, because it's True that this AYCE gem is THE best of its kind. We went there around 9 on a Saturday nite and I was seriously dreading that we'd have to wait a long time to be seated, but nope. We got our table right after our host came to greet us. After that, everything was a blur of sushi bliss. We didn't get to eat anything the whole day since we were busy with all the road tripping outside of vegas so we were pretty famished when we started our AYCE ordeal. I must've ordered almost the whole sushi menu and a good number of appetizers. Within about 5-10 minutes, our food was delivered to our table in a succession of what I remembered as a delishness galore. I can't believe it. I've found what I've been looking for all my life: a place that delivers excellent quality packed in massive quantity. For the first time, the slices of fish was the main diva of the show rather than the glob of rice that usually takes up the space of the stage like in most other AYCE joints. I was astounded to see the gloriously huge pieces of fish stacked on top of a small piece of the sushi rice. And the seasoning?? Frickin fantastically spectacularly amazingly bombass diggity good. I love my fish naked and raw just as long as they're fresh, but damn, when they're dressed in a bit of that sexy ponzu and garlic or Yuzu sauces, I felt like I was hooked on ecstasy. I've never had my sushi served that way, but consider my cherry well popped coz I'm now I'm a lifelong addict for it. As for the appetizer, hot diggity damn, I do love me that pork belly. Don't get me wrong though. Just like their sushi, their appetizers were just as good, too, but I can't get over how tender and perfectly flavored that piece of meat was.   With all that said and done, all that I regretted from my experience at Sakana was that I didn't have enough appetite or room in my stomach to eat more. For the dinner price of $25 ish per person, it'd be like finding needle in a haystack if I ever find a place as good as this one. With that said, I'd be back in a heartbeat when I'm in Vegas again for sure.",

Located in the Target shopping centered on Maryland and Flamingo, we came to this spot recommend by our girl Angeli D. \"Where you at girl?!\" First impressions - very limited parking. There's a Filipino restaurant and other stores that share the corner, so good parking is a gamble.   The decor inside is awesome! Art deco mixed with traditional Japanese art. They have a cool chalkboard that covers the front window with a list of menu items, new items, and favorite rolls written on it. In the middle of the restaurant is a cool bar like table that sits 12 people comfortably. The sushi bar sits 8 and they have 3 coool bench booth setups that can sit another 12. The ambience here is refreshing, hip and popping. Not too loud.   Service here is surprisingly better than the ones we get at Yuma and Kaya. Carlos walked us through our questions on some items we didn't recognize, and made great recommendations including the Dancing Eel, The Shit, and Pang. No dry glasses, and no empty plates. Kept making room for our new dishes, and on top of us when it looked like we needed more. He was patient with us, with it being our first time here, he didn't give off that hurry up or \"really?\" Attitude. In fact today the servers seemed to be on point at both bar and tables. Good job guys.   Ordered: Green muscle Salmon Kama Seaweed salad Miso soup Shrimp tempura  Pang Pork belly Bacon & lobster skewer Bacon & asparagus skewer Dragon ball (baked lobster mix with mushroom  Nigiri: Salmon Garlic tuna Super white Albacore Sarada lobster  Rolls: Lobster roll Dancing eel roll  Dessert: Green tea ice cream  Nigiri proportions are good here. They are not shy at all here with their servings. The rice is just perfect, no huge rice servings and small proportioned fish, where like in most places you fill up on rice. Salmon Kama here is small, but shoots, they have it. They have lobster apart of their ingredients, and that's a plus. Skewers not as big as some places, but is tasty.  We'd like to come back and try the dinner menu, but overall for AYCE, customer service, and quality, they get 5 stars from me.",

Very fresh sushi and lots of side dishes to choose from. Ambiance is whimsical and cozy.   Because of how busy it is, you might have to ask someone who isn't your server for a drink refill etc, but they are all very polite and get you what you need.   Try the cajun nigiri and the super white tuna. Very very good. The maguro was done well too. I don't think you can go wrong ordering here. If there's a wait (ours was about half an hour), it'll be worth it.",

We didn't mind the wait, there's good music and music videos on all the TVs to keep you occupied.  We did the all you can eat dinner and we're surprised by the immense options! It's not just sushi, you can get desserts, skewers, etc. we mostly had sushi and rolls though which were all very good. They don't use a ton of rice which is great because it lets you have room for more.  Everything tastes fresh and was flavorful. The staff were really quick to ask if we wanted more whenever we finished our current orders. We also ordered some beers which were 2 for 1.  Overall we loved this place: the prices are great, the food is good, and the staff were quick and very friendly.",

Its one of those spots with amazing amazing food but really bad with the staff. We weren't being catered too all that much, towards the end of our meal when we wanted to order dessert a big party came in and the focus was on them...it took 30 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our final order and a check.

    "text": "This is my favorite AYCE in town! They have many appetizers, nigiri, rolls, desserts, and drinks to choose from. The fish is always so fresh and the fish to rice ratio is spot on.  My usual choices are hamachi/salmon kama, baked mussels, bacon & asparagus skewer, and salmon and yellowtail nigiri. When I'm here for dinner, I order uni and ama ebi (sweet shrimp--the head is separately deep fried and if you're daring enough, eat the whole head!). They recommend trying The Shit and Pang, which are unique appetizers (IMO it's not bad, but nothing to write home about). For the rolls try the Lisa Lisa, or one of the baked rolls. So good! For dessert, try the Deep Fried Banana or any of the house made desserts.  The interior is nicely decorated with some Asian-inspired trinkets on the walls. There are many seats up front with a large room in the back for more private parties. Pay attention to the chalkboard in the middle of the room--sometimes they have unique specials! Everything is pleasant, although the floor could use a good scrubbing.  Service is usually great, but in my experience they seem to forget at least one order from time to time. Not a big deal, just remind them and they'll bring it out promptly. They are good with coming back to take additional orders and refilling drinks.  As my favorite sushi place in town, I have yet to be disappointed by the sushi or service. I love the fish to rice ratio as well as the desserts. This is my standard for sushi in Vegas!",

    "text": "While on vacation in Las Vegas, my wife and myself were in the mood for some ayce sushi.  Especially with the high reviews for Sakana, we decided to give them a try one night. We came with our kids at about 8pm, and it was a bit crowded, but not too bad.  i think we waited for about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night.   I do have to say that the service is extremely fast.  The food came out minutes after we ordered it!  The taste was great, and the server was nice, but also hurried (as expected and appreciated).  It is too bad that the top menu items are only \"1 time at dinner\" such as the Uni.  However, it is understood to keep that policy so that the price remains reasonable and people don't take advantage.  The one thing about their policies that i didn't like is the \"Yelp\" forcing.  Like many other Japanese places, they offer you a free drink with Yelp.  However, the difference is that instead of just checking in (and writing a review later), they force you to write a review before the free drink.  That is a bit weird that they expect you to review before eating, and have to write it on your phone.    I am updating my review now so that I can give a True feedback to the restaurant.  Sakana is a great option for ayce in Vegas, but just know it is off the strip.  I plan on returning one day.  Funny thing is that I actually went to Sakana about a year ago with some co-workers here in Vegas.  However, when we arrived, they lost their liquor license, so we decided to go eat somewhere else.  I am glad that I returned and that their liquor license is back.",

My favorites include the salmon belly nigiri, towering sashimi poki, and the baked mussels. If you're feeling the need to spice up your life, the Call 911 Roll is just the thing to order.

Friendship goals, y'all.   So, I came here with my darling sushi skank on a Wednesday evening around 7 and it was PACKED! First of all, the parking lot was packed and I was like \"no big deal. People are probably off to do other things besides eat all the sushi I want\". Nope, Sakana was packed, with a wait list. What in the shizz is this actually about? It's WEDNESDAY! Okay, okay. So, we got on the wait list and sat on this little bench near the front door and stalked people who were eating, all while proclaiming how excited and hungry we were. We waited probably 15 minutes and that was quite enough of that nonsense.  Then....we were seated! Yay. Everyone from the front staff to the waiters and water peeps were all very friendly and seemed to generally want to assist in creating a good experience. Thank you! There is nothing worse than getting crappy service but good food. Winning all around! So, anyway, the food. Pretty amazing. In my sushi blackout, I actually managed to make a little note on my phone of what I ate(pat on the back, dude).  Here is(most)of what I ate before I rolled out of this joint, gastro sick and questioning my life choices: *Spicy garlic edamame(the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. For reals, yo. This is my jam right here. Salty, spicy, garlicky, hot, intense, amazing. Get it and thank me later). *Agedashi tofu(not the best I`ve ever had but certainly a contender for my heart. I love me some agedashi tofu. I wanted more. I wish the portion was larger). *Green baked mussels(Maybe it's just me, but I didn`t particular enjoy these here. I guess this is a Vegas thing? I`m not sure. I had them at one place I enjoyed them at and the rest have just been OK. Pass for me). * Nigiri was enjoyed in the form of tuna, yellowtail, cajun tuna, octopus, seared lemon salmon. All were good but my stand outs were the cajun tuna, octopus and seared lemon salmon. I could live off of those. *Hand rolls(not jobs, rolls): Lemon salmon(I admittedly love lemon and salmon so this was really an amazing experience for me), Lisa Lisa(Meh. Not my thing. Too much sauce, too much...too much), Golden Tiger(another one I didn`t pick and didn`t particularly care for because I felt like my arteries were clogging the moment I ate this deep fried monster), Bam bam roll(really yummy. I would get it again).  Random choice: Towering Sashimi Poki. It was good but I`m not sure I would order it again because it did feel a bit \"heavy\" for me with the crispy wonton underneath the sauced up fish. It was alright. Worth a try if you're into sauce and spice.  At the end I had green tea panna cotta, which was surprisingly addicted and I wanted to ask for another and another.   Overall, I want to come back here, so if you're in the mood for sushi, please take me out!",

First thing first, because we only  have2ppl and don't mind to sit at the bar, so no waiting at all!!   Then, the rice is incredibly small under a generously big fish, so love this place!! Fish is fresh, not bad, very value to money!!   Although it is a bit annoying for waiters to keep coming and checking you out, they  are very efficient and helpful...  Plus they  will turn down the light and turn  on music to celebrate customers birthdays, so quite a delightful place to visit!!   Worth  the money so much, just don't come if  you target proper japanese food and style",

After seeing multiple check ins from a Yelper I know and trust I bookmarked it and eventually made my way down. The first thing about them is that the fish to rice ratio is fantastic. So many places barely put a sliver of fish so that's a welcome surprise. They customer service was great. The servers are always making sure you're good to go, whether it's beer or water or more rolls. The rolls Come out quick. It was almost too quick because I expected them to take longer so I had a table full of rolls-a good problem to have. The chefs are fun to converse with, which is an underrated part of sushi experience when eating at a bar. An outgoing chef changes the entire vibe. Their fresh Wasabi is straight (fire emojis). It's soooo soooo good. If you're a drinker, they have a good 2 for 1 happy hour that I make sure to always take advantage of.  If you need a sushi place, come to this one",

We got sat a small 2 person table and when we asked for a larger table since the restaurant wasn't that busy. The older Asian lady said \"no\" dinner table is set by how many people are eating. Ok fine we get it you want to maximize your seating potential but when you have 15 out of your 20 tables open your think you'd accommodate since it's so early in the dinner service.  Like I said the food was great, when it came time to order some dessert I asked what kind on mochi brand that they used the same lady rolled her eyes and said in a rude annoyed voice that she did not know what kinda of brand and that they made it In house, when I said really she then said it's a Japanese brand. Like comon now why you wanna bullshit for, I asked what brand it was cause coffee mocha is my fav but only certain brands actually make it good though. \"Mikawaya and Maeda-en\" make really good coffee flavored mochi ice creams.  In all it was a mediocre experience, would I come back? Maybe if I was in the area, but really I'd have to be in the mood for some sushi with a side of shotty customer service.\"",

Most places are ok at best and rarely am I willing to pay full price for \"ok at best\". So when a fellow Foodie friend and yelper couldn't contain her excitement for Sakana, I knew this place had to be legit. She don't lie and Sakana don't disappoint.   My only regret is not living close enough to Vegas to experience Sakana more often. Nevada is hella lucky to have this quality at this price point. Just believe all the yelp reviews and get thyself here for AYCE sushi extravaganza!",

The wait can be long though and when we went, there wasn't really a hostess so you just walk in and write your name down and have to listen for when they call your name. We waited for about an hour on a Friday night. Although once you are seated, the wait time for your food and service isn't very long. Quality of good was great too! Definitely try the honey toast for dessert! Good portions. Would recommend this place to others but not sure if it's worth the long hour wait.",

    "text": "AYCE All You Can Eat Sushi spot. OISHI! First, plenty parking spot in open plaza. Spots nearest to entrance just may be taken because this place is so popular. Second, wait is worth it, if there is one. Third, sushi made to order (so not just rotating on a belt and you have NO idea how long it's been sitting out). Fourth, fun vibe- AYCE lunch & dinner prices reasonable. Come hungry. Dinner time is truly the best deal for your money- as you will see I'm attached zoomed in photos, they have some items \"dinner only\" and \"1 per person\" and even some \"1 per table\" too! So if those are your faves, be aware! The servers are super busy speeding past, but smile! Be nice and ask away! This is a fave for many reasons! Highly recommend for locals and visitors! Bonus: if you come around 3pm-ish, and ask nicely, they may honor the dinner price for you!",

Boy, this is a must to come when you want some great sushi without breaking your bank. Their AYCE sushi dinner is only $25.95 and what I enjoyed about their offering is that it includes at least 1 order of their premium nigiri sushi which includes salmon belly, uni, trout and ami ebi. The fish was fresh and the sushi bar chefs were fast and professional. Truly enjoyed my dinner here and will definitely come back when I'm in town. YOU WON'T REGRET COMING HERE!!",

    "text": "Last Friday, after a long day working on the yard due to a broken branch from the snow, my boyfriend and I thought we deserved AYCE sushi! We've been to Yama and Goyemon and recently heard of Sakana. With all the great reviews, we thought, why not. Maybe it'll be a new place to bring our friends when they visit. Upon arrival, we had to wait maybe 45 minutes to 1 hour. We had about 13 people in front of us.  This is a good sign for a sushi spot since you know they are going through rounds of fish and therefore, the fish should be fresh.  Our first plate was great. The oysters and ama ebi (sweet shrimp) came out first. The oyster tasted great with the flavors that they put on it.  The sweet shrimp was also not bad. They also provide the shrimp head here fried similar to Yama. Goyemon usually just provides the body.  First time trying the fried shrimp head. Not bad since its fried but also gets difficult to chew towards the end due to the shrimp shell.  After the first plate the rest of the sushi came out. We got all the popular items that were 1 per person orders as well as the main items like yellowtail, white tuna, etc.  Not sure if the waitress didn't hear us right or randomly put down numbers but our order definitely did not come out right. We were trying to avoid raw salmon due to the parasite fears and yet we got both the salmon belly (which we did order) but also 2 more orders of regular salmon (that we did not order). Our yellowtail and another order of white tuna was also missing.  Also they had scallop which is one of my favorites though it is not the nice fresh type like at Goyemon. This one has that extra outer ring and doesn't seem as fresh.  The fish here taste fine. Seemed ok for freshness but most of them did have some type of ponzu or their \"300\" sauce on it.  Therefore, if you like your fish without sauce and like to control your own soy sauce quantity, then this place may not be the place for you.  My boyfriend also noticed that though the fish were decent sized, the rice quantity was more, which combined with the sauce on each fish would fill you up faster.  Something to note if you are trying to make the most of your AYCE experience. So for rice to fish ratio, Goyemon wins on this one.   We also got the yakitori items. Bacon and lobster, bacon and scallop, chicken, and sausage. These items were just ok. Nothing special and the bacon ones were overwhelmed by the bacon so not much seafood taste.  For dessert, we got the mini honey toast, fried banana, green tea ice cream and red bean ice cream. Mini honey toast and fried banana both come with vanilla ice cream. Mini honey toast we just ok. It's pretty much ice cream on a piece of sweet toast. The fried banana had a weird aftertaste to it. Not sure if it was in the batter or the banana itself.  Lastly, one thing I was very disappointed in was the ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant so anytime I get ice cream, I take Lactaid pills. Because of this, I only eat ice cream when it's worth it.  Green tea also happens to be my favorite usually but the ice cream here had barely any taste. Both the green tea and red bean barely could be recognizable.  The vanilla that came with my fried banana ended up being the best one, but it could have been due to the chocolate fudge that was drizzled on top of the ice cream.  Overall, Sakana was OK.  Sushi is fine and I don't think most people would be disappointed. If our orders came out correct, maybe we'd had enjoyed it more. Recommendation would be to send it back if they get it wrong so you don't end up filling your stomach with something you didn't order.  The dessert was also a bad way to end the night.  So, if you just want sushi, this place is fine but go get desert somewhere else.",

Neko is one of my all time favorite sushi places in Vegas, which makes sense why I loved Sakana the first time (same menu). The fish is always fresh. I mean melt in your mouth fresh! I love the seared lemon salmon and cajun tuna. So much flavor! They also have no-rice rolls for those who are trying to avoid more carbs!  Ambiance of both locations is very similar. The music they play is good, however it was kind of loud for conversation.  I've been to other sushi joints all over town, but hands down Sakana, and it's sister restaurant never disappoint.   Do yourself a favor and go here for AYCE....It's the way to go. You will not be disappointed!!",

We first walked in and the place was pretty busy. Read the signs that said, 'Please wait to be seated'. Stood there waiting about 5 minutes before flagging a worker down to ask if there was someone who could help us. She pointed to the clip board a few feet I front of us and told us to sign in.  Sushi/fish tasted good, service was mediocre. AYCE price was average.",

I looked up an AYCE place and this one was on top of the list. There was a bit of wait on a Thursday night but nothing crazy. We were seated and our sever, David, was really nice. Some of the AYCE sushi places I've tried in LA has a 3 rounds limit so you tend to order too much in the first round. Here, you just order as you want more, which I really like. We didn't get rolls, mostly nigiri, sashimi and their apps and skewers. The fishes taste really good and fresh. I felt like the quality of the food is 5x more at least than the price we paid. The servers also bring the food really quickly and they're very quick to respond when you ask for assistance. They also have a lot of selection and they include desserts too :) Next Vegas visit I'll make sure to come back here.",

None of them had that frozen taste to them. The salmon nigiri was my favorite- smooth and buttery. It is also True that they don't over stuff their rolls with rice. Another plus is that you can order half rolls on the eight piece rolls which is a great way to try more rolls. They have a 2 for 1 drink special that is all day!   Such a great deal. Sakana is now on my Vegas musts when I'm in town!",

When asking about the rolls that we didn't order, our server said it's on our paper, so we have to eat it.  Wouldn't show us where we ordered it.

    "text": "OVERALL: 8.9/10 (Yelp conversion: 5/5). Average based on the breakdown at the bottom of this review.  The AYCE here (for dinner) is extremely #worth if you can break even by eating at minimum 2 premium rolls (for example, $9.95 each for the sashimi or rainbow), and at least two orders of the premium 2pc sushi (for example, $4.95 for each of the oyster / salmon belly / uni). Everything else ordered past that (per person) is worth it since you already broke even (based on the a la carte prices on the menu, which are incredibly pricey for the portion sizes).  I was a party of 1 and there was an end seat at the sushi bar, which I gladly took. This made ordering extremely easy - I was in and out within 30 minutes of arriving, even after waiting 5 minutes after putting my name in the queue (4 parties ahead of me, all of size 2 or greater).   After tax, the AYCE dinner came out to $28.03 (pre-tip). My experience was great, since the sushi chef was extremely attentive and helpful at describing what was good, although this may have been due to me sitting directly in front of him at the sushi bar.  1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 7/10. Had a decent selection & offering, but this is Las Vegas, which is in a landlocked state, and no access to fresh fish - you get what your geography gives you.  2) FRESHNESS: 8/10. Again, it's land-locked, don't go in expecting Kashiba-level freshness. This isn't near a farmer's market, nor is it going to taste as fresh as one.  3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10/10. If I ordered the equivalent meal off of the a-la-carte menu (which is the same as the AYCE menu, but you pay the listed price instead of the AYCE price), I would have had to pay closer to $78, given that each of the premium rolls are $9.95 (I ordered 4), the 2pc sushi dishes were $4.95 each (I ordered 6), and other dishes ranged from $2.95 (cheaper sushi pieces) to $14.50 (Seafood Salad).  4) SERVICE: 9.5/10. This is somewhat biased since I was sitting at the sushi bar, and the sushi chef I could order from was literally serving only me and a few table orders (despite the place being packed to the point of a wait list). The wait staff weren't super attentive, and the -0.5 stars is from my water being not refilled for over 20 minutes (even though the wait staff camped behind me since that's where the point-of-sale device was).  5) PRICE: 10/10. I didn't eat lunch and wanted something filling, given that I had hiked this entire day. Needless to say, $33 including tip for an all-you-can-eat sushi meal is a bargain.  The atmosphere and decor is somewhat nice too; the TV was playing K-Pop songs the entire time I was there (I saw \"Gentleman\" and \"Hangover\" by PSY, as well as some K-Pop male idol group whose name escapes me). Interesting that a Japanese restaurant plays so much K-Pop.  I'll visit again next time I'm in town - great recommendation if you're craving AYCE sushi in Las Vegas!",

Everything was super delicious. The fish was extremely fresh and everything came out fast! I've never tried halibut sashimi before, only pan seared and oh my! It was heavenly! The servers were fun and very attentive. I don't think we had an empty plate sitting in front of us for more than 2 mins. The sushi chefs are really nice and fun as well! Their portions were generous and everything was bomb. Definitely hoping that we'll crave sushi once more on this trip, otherwise I'll be more than excited to be back in Vegas next time!",

Not a single server even acknowledged we were there, no one even said we will be right with you. They all just avoided eye contact so after 15 minutes we walked out and found a better place that wanted our business.",

After I got home, I was unable to go to work as my stomach was not happy. It did not get any better, from hourly diaherea to every twenty minutes and vomiting.

    "text": "I rarely leave mediocre reviews, and am so sad since I really wanted to love this place. The AYCE is okay, but hostess needs more training on seating customers. I arrived 6:30pm on a Tuesday, looking to get a table for 5. Come 35 minutes later and after seeing 4 later parties seated before us, we are still the only ones on the waiting bench. I noticed the other parties of 3, 3, 4, 4 were seated by pulling two tables together, and kindly asked her why the staff couldn't do the same for our party of 5. Mind you, I've been standing with her for the past 25 minutes and haven't received a smile from her yet - but she explains that she is waiting on a table to leave and they are about to go. And on we wait for another 10 minutes, while another 2 parties get seated before us. To my disappointment, go ahead, GUESS how she seats us? By pulling 2 tables together. Why, OH WHY didn't she do this 35 minutes ago when we were the first to arrive??!!? It takes just as many tables to seat 4 people, as it is for 5 people. Minus 1 for poor planning. But we didn't let this upset our night. We were on a mission to try the AYCE menu. Lunch is $20.95, and dinner service is $25.95. The menu is pretty extensive, and we enjoyed our meal. Plus 1 for prompt serving & refilling... Another staff member was constantly refilling our waters. There was one instance where our server brought the wrong item to our table tho, and just shrugged it off ... Minus 1. My favorite was the Red Snapper Nigiri, Tiger Roll, Chanel Roll, and Bulgogi Nachos. The rolls seemed to have a lot of sauce on it, a little too much for my preference, and the fish was okay, but not too memorable. Parties of 6 are charged 18% gratuity automatically. And there are signs about only splitting bills 6 ways for parties of 6 or greater. The ladies restroom is decked out in Hello Kitty, near to my heart. And the restaurant decor is really nice. Plus 1 for decor. I'd probably return to give it another try if they didn't punish larger parties and have us wait 35 minutes - didn't offer a water or something to drink during our wait. I watched 18 people get seated before us, and was so hungry and parched by the time we were seated :( I usually dine with my family, and this place didn't make my list of places to bring them since the long wait is just not worth it.",

Goyemon restaurant so far has fresh Uni everytime I'm there.  * You get not 1 order, but 1 oyster only. * Seafood salad is just a clump of leftover meat of all sizes. Not pretty to eat and I was afraid I might get a stomach ache.  * Green panna cotta dessert wth is that? Bitter.

We ordered the all you can eat $25 dinner. We also indulged in the 2 for 1 alcoholic beverages. That special runs all day everyday! Food was good, fast and fresh! Definitely way better than Yamaha sushi across the street. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to sign yourself in on a waiting list upon entering. There's no host there to control that list.",

Then some salmon belly with a dab of real wasabi not sure which was better the real wasabi or the belly .   Last special of the night that I really like was some mixed fish poke that was wrapped in a thinly sliced cucumber I think.  All of the rolls that we had were good but I'm into ngiri.  There was some mackerel that was great and all the fish was very fresh tonight.  The chef kept bringing little dishes like some scallop in the shell with salty lemony sauce and some black and regular masago.  Great place I hope the quality stays and the price 22 bucks if I remember right",

Made me, my husband, and our two kids wait 1 hour when the place was half empty, waiters were walking around doing nothing. A couple came after our 45 minutes of waiting and were seated and had food in less than 10 mins. They didn't offer us water once in our hour of waiting, and mind you we had a six year old tired and hungry with us. We walked out after a hour, there's no way I would've spent a penny here at this point. And just so you know its off the Vegas strip and the manager told us when we arrived to call our taxi 30 minutes in advance as they take a while, we called our taxi after we were very hungry at this point and the taxi service said a hour to pick us up. I heard the food was good here, but we wouldn't know.",

The food was just OK, 3 star quality even for a AYCE sushi place at about $22 a person. The service was slow, they had plenty of servers though. About 45 minutes into lunch....a server came to my friend who sat at the end of the table as he was eating...told him to STAND UP because \"we need your chair\". First response from my friend was complying... then he looked around....there were PLENTY of empty tables! So he asked....why my chair? There's a lot of chairs....so the server responded by saying \"what if other people come? They will need that chair\" let me repeat.... they had plenty of empty tables!! And the worst part is not that my friend was still eating his food when he was told to stand up....the worst part os that the group who the server planned to give the chair to only had 3 people...so they didn't even need the chair!

I enjoyed all the desserts so save room, the green tea pana cotta in particular.   We ordered just about everything. The appetizers were great but I wasn't too impressed with the miso soup. Some hand rolls I ordered turned into cut rolls but that's fine, I just shared with my party. This slightly became an issue because it equated into a lot of extra food. The only reason I docked a star was the \"lobster\" and \"crab\" were all imitation. I wish they stated that on the menu. I was expecting at least prawns for \"lobster\" like at most places.   Anyways, they took reservations for my large party and we were seated right on time. This is located across the street from the Citibank.",

Sakana uses about half the rice and same amount of fish as most place (like Yama, which is in the shopping center across Maryland). The rice is nice and fluffy, sometimes a touch too loose.   I come here at least once every two weeks. That's how damn good they are. I deal mostly with nigiri only, but the few rolls I've tried have been good. If you want something spicy try the Call 911 Roll. For appetizers definitely the pang.  Best part is 2 for 1 drinks. Need I say more.",

The main thing I remember was that our nigiri had very little rice on it, which is generous for an AYCE as you have to eat everything.  This meant I was able to cram a few extra orders of nigiri in as I wasn't stuffed with rice.  The Batman Burrito was our favorite non-nigiri item, and I think we ended up ordering 3 orders when all was said and done.  I tried a few other dishes from the kitchen which were ok, and the rolls weren't bad either, but that's not my thing.  The service was a strange mix.  They were super attentive and kept coming over to us to ask if we wanted anything else.  Unfortunately, they kept forgetting 1 item off each order, so we kept having to re-order.  Not a huge deal, but it was sort of hard to keep track of if we had gotten to try a dish.  Good value for under $25.  Uncomfortable seating, though.  Oh well, I'll be back.",

We spent only 30 min total for this meal. Didn't even want to try the desserts. There was only one server while we were there for lunch. We had to wait a long time for everything. We asked got hot tea but it was never served. I had such a high expectation for this place based on other a Yelp reviews but... Big disappointment.",

They put WAY too much sauce on the rolls so next time I go, I plan on ordering the sauce on the side. I got the popcorn lobster roll and it was drenched in 3 different sauces (one seemed to be just plain mayo-gross) and it kind of ruined the flavor of the roll and turned it into a goo-ey mess. I would say the $25.99 AYCE option is a great deal if you get the nigiri and no-rice plates (available only at dinner) since they give you a generous cut of fish and not too much rice. The rolls are big and quite rich so they fill you up fast. I went in starving and could not finish the 2 rolls I ordered. (I also had eaten 2 pieces of salmon sushi). My total would have been $27 if I had just ordered a la carte so I didn't really get to take advantage of the AYCE price but next time I come back, I'll be sticking to just the nigiri, sashimi salad and a hand rolls.",

Some of my orders are missing and they keep me waiting a long time if I want more orders (embarrassing!). I still remember the cold face of an old asian waitress who passes me as if I am invisible. The other day, I went there for lunch and they seemed just finished some renovation work. The whole room was full of paint smell which to my surprise did not worry them a bit. For one-time customers, the place is on par with other great AYCE sushi (Goyemon, Yama sushi...) you can find. For return customers, the Yama sushi across the street could be better in terms of the professional service. At least they do not make me write a complaint.",

Their appetizer's are to die for- I suggest everyone try \"the shit\" appetizer, because it is..well.. I don't know how else to say, THE SHIT! I would definitely recommend coming and trying, the servers and staff are all very friendly and very attentive, I'd give more stars if I could based on just the service alone, and even more stars for the sushi! The fish are VERY fresh, not a bad taste in my mouth throughout. The only take away would be it is very chilly due to all the fans running. OVERALL I WOULD COME HERE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN ETC ETC THIS IS MY NEW SUSHI SPOT",

They have all of the basics on the menu and most things are pretty fresh. The uni, however, was kind of old and gooey.   Sakana is located in the Target plaza on Maryland and Flamingo. It's the very last shop on the north flamingo side. The interior decor was so-so.   I think if they could easily become a more popular place if they liven up the atmosphere a bit.",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of most sushi restaurants in Vegas. There are a couple expensive ones on the Strip that are great but pricey, and otherwise there are very few spots that I like in a more affordable price range.  Sakana, however, far exceeds my expectations. The chefs will talk with you, they're very friendly, and offer excellent recommendations. If you ask for whatever is good that day, you will get some great sushi, and it won't be the same every time either. I've already been here 3 times since I found out about it a month ago, and each time I've been served a different array of dishes, every single one of them outstanding.  But the most impressive thing about Sakana is that they actually cook great sushi rice. This is very rare for sushi restaurants in Vegas, and in my opinion makes a huge difference in the quality of the meal.  On top of the excellent food and chefs who I love, the prices are fantastic. At $22.95 for all-you-can-eat dinner as well as 2-for-1 beers during happy hour, the check will be about the same as any other all-you-can-eat sushi place in town, but the meal will be a hundred times better.  I urge you to sit at the sushi bar. The chefs are engaging and entertaining, but they will give you time to talk among yourselves when appropriate. And if you're adventurous (or already know how amazing it is), order quail egg, because it's one of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere.",

Even when we sat at a table with the kids they took the time to listen to our customization (hubby likes super spicy but hates garlic and mayo.  I eat anything as long as it isn't spicy, my son likes spicy but not too much and loves cream cheese).  They also have special dishes on the weekend, which so far have been wonderful!  I like that not everything is a roll or drowned in sauce.  Definitely try the Scallop Nigiri, no mayo, the amaebi with the head fried, the toro steak if they have it, and the Sakana Poki.  The sashimi salad is good (the shrimp tempura is sometimes a little stale but otherwise great dish).  My younger son loves the short ribs, he had three bowls.  The shrimp tempura is a little different than other places, the batter is different but tasty.    Definitely come give them a try!  Worth the drive from other parts of town.",

From uni, salmon belly, fresh umami, shrimp heads, garlic tuna, albacore, snapper, specialty sushi pieces and 100 other different things I can't remember.   This is by far the best all you can eat sushi houses I've ever been to. The best thing about it is, they don't give you enormous amounts of rice that other places do to fill you up.   The staff is very friendly and answers any questions you have. The sushi chef offers jokes, compliments and just generally a warm and friendly guy.   This place is a must for any sushi fans, hungry or not. You can't beat $25.",

    "text": "Here's whats worth ordering (best first):  1) Salmon belly (limit 1) 2) Poke stack (limit 1) 3) Garlic tuna 4) Super white tuna 5) Ocean trout (limit 1)  Here's what wasn't so good:  6) Scallop - I thought this was going to be a single piece of raw scallop but it was small pieces of not fresh cooked scallop. Not good...  7) Uni - Ugh, i'm disappointed this wasn't good but it didn't taste fresh at all - very salty and tasted too much like the sea. Disappointing because this is one of the \"limit 1\" items and would've made the dinner more worth it if it was good!  8) Seafood salad - chopped up (probably not the freshest) cuts of various fish including tuna, salmon, hamachi etc. The quality of fish in this is clearly not as good as what you would get in nigiri , hence why they douse it in sauce. The benefit is no rice though. Tradeoffs...  Overall, this place offers AYCE for a really good value. Its also worth noting that the service is impeccable here. Even if you aren't even remotely finished with your order, a waiter will come by to ask you what you want next. Same for the drinks. They definitely run a tight ship here.",

    "text": "Saw the reviews and photos and couldn't wait to try this place.  That was a good decision.    Came here for AYCE.  They have a good list of items, and one of the best things about this place is they offer half orders (for most sushi rolls).  I noticed alot of their items are similar to the items that are in Sumo Sushi or Jjanga.  They also have some korean food, and I'm curious if they are affiliated with Hwaro....only because the first time I tried \"the Shit\" was in Hwaro, and they offer than same \"the Shit\" here in Sakana.    They have every time of fish, including my favorites that cannot be found in all places: super white tuna, salmon belly, and yellowtail belly.  They are very generous with their portions to.  I like that they put some kind of sauce in their nigiris so it doesn't taste too plain.    They rolls were good.  I got the Something Wrong roll, which has the fried soft shell crab on the inside, and two pieces of fish on the outside with garlic ponzu sauce.  One of my favorites.  Also tried some of their spicy rolls, and yes they were spicy!    Also on of my favorites about this place is the desserts.  Most AYCE only offer one thing of dessert, but you can order some of the dessert items more than once (except ice cream).    Being in an older location (and maybe it was wrong for me to judge a restroom based on this), the restroom is very clean.  There's a floor lamp and Hello Kitty painted on the back of the women's restrooms.    This has definitely become one of my favorite sushi places.",

My family and I have been regulars here for a few years, but we are never going there again. Not because of the food, but the worst service that progressively keeps getting worse every visit. This is due to a woman named Anna, she is always there and she loves to throw plates on the table. It seems to be her thing to make the costumers feel horrible for dining there. Many occurrences happened this time, once was that we asked to add a table from someone since we had a toddler in our party. They said yes, but Anna and one other man named Edwin attempted to scold us, persecuting us without letting us explain ourselves. Saying to put the table back now and to squeeze in. Even though half of the restaurant, including the middle table was empty. Who does that? And, of course, plate throwing this time, one time threw it on top of my aunty's sunglasses too. She yelled at us for being a large party (6 of us with 2 small kids) that should be aware that people are waiting, not once, but twice. Neither times she talked to us was before our 1.5 hours were up. When we asked to talk to her manager, she said said we had 5 minutes left and kept talking over us saying, \"I know, I know, I know\", rolling her eyes, glaring at us, then said there's no manager. This is only a little bit of what she's done. I have never met someone as rude as her! Every time we go, she ends up being our server. So around the last 5 times, we have been treated badly with her stuck up attitude and annoyed demeanor. If you see her, run! She will ruin your day every time. We are respectful people, my parents have been in this industry, like she has. There's no excuse that she treats the customers like a burden when sakana's motto is \"our family works hard for your smile\".",

Even though we paid a hefty cab fare there and back from our hotel near the Strip, as I had suspected after reading reviews and seeing the strip-mall address, the food was really great at an unbelievably great price. My nephew opted for the $25 all you can eat, I went a la carte. In either case, the fish was great quality, even Uni was fresh and yellow, the sushi chef, even though not Japanese and he explained on his first day there, he certainly knew his stuff and delivered quickly, joyfully, and very tasty. Rolls, nigiri, seaweed salad, cooked dishes, all were very, very good.  I've eaten sushi all over the world, and this can stand up to most places I've enjoyed.  Don't hesitate, get yerself there!",

There's also BOGO on alcohol throughout the day. We arrived relatively early for lunch  and the whole placed was almost full. I can only imagine how busy it must be during peak dinner time.

Nondescript shopping center but hopping busy place inside. I ate at the bar and they really worked quick.  They had lots of specialty rolls and let me order 1/2 portions so I could try a variety.  What a treat.  Two for one beers too.  I'd say this is a Vegas find!  All you can eat was only $25.95.  In a sea of overpriced food, this was a great value and good tasting too. Well, I'm back again!  Love this Vegas treat.",

My first reaction to our first plate made me gasp because I didnt expect it to look so authentic and fresh. I mean, the fish pieces were huge and you could hardly see the rice.  Food tasted great except the salmon skin roll, it was extremely sweet which made it hard to finish.  Comparing this location to others, my biggest gripe is that there are too many choices that are limited to one order only such as, salmon belly (at goyemon its unlimited until it runs out).  I also like my fish without sauces but almost every sushi came out seasoned to some extent whether it was with ponzu or cream based. However, some people may like it and I enjoyed it as well but I may not have known if there is a plain option.  My overall experience was great and it truly does get busy which is a good sign of a successful business. I would say to try it and judge it for yourself.",

They give out more protein than rice on their nigiri, they have fast services even on a busy night. The place is decorated beautifully and overall a fun environment to eat and have hang out with friends and love ones.  I would definitely recommend this place to bring your date, friends, family or any other love ones to.",

But unfortunately there were many tables for 4 and the shop was not that busy at all. Until we left, those table for 4 were still empty. Sometimes you need to be flexible and make customers feel you treat them nicely.  Besides that everything else is perfect. The chief at the bar also asked if we need anything else which is really nice of him. That isnt his job.  Really recommend Pang bread.",

We ordered salmon, lemon seared salmon, yellowtail, albacore, 300 albacore, shrimp tempura, and gyozas. We ordered a golden philadelphia roll and a monkey roll but we weren't big fans. The fish to rice ratio was amazing with so much more fish than rice. We would strongly recommend paying the extra dollars for dinner as some of the most delicious items are served only during dinner; ocean trout and salmon belly.  Sakana has no wait when we went but it is a Thursday early afternoon.   We love all the nigiri ! We will be back!  The customer service could be a bit more warm but they still did very well.

Upon entering the restaurant, there were at least five dirty tables. The waiting area is very small and all the people who were waiting in the front of the door were waiting for to be seated due to the dirty tables. First of all it's literally a fire hazard to be blocking the door like that. I understand they were short staffed, but it's literally like this every time I come to eat at this restaurant.   We were seated but didn't receive menus, or even water. Management needs to address these concerns quick. If you got bad service, then the business may suffer no matter how great the food is.",

The inside decor is modern with lanterns and fairy lights. The noise level is moderate to loud.   The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is insane and you're basically eating sashimi because there is just a tiny ball of rice under a thick piece of fresh fish. There is a 2 for 1 special on the alcoholic drinks as well if you decide to get saki, soju, wine, beer, etc. Lunch price is fair, just a little under $21 and a little under $26 for dinner. They should be charging more for the quality they present, and we waited 40 min for a table and I wasn't upset one bit.  Came with a party of 5, and once we ordered, our food was out on the table within 10 min! Quick, fast, fresh, and it left everyone impressed. We were full and only stayed for less than 50 min.   Definitely would come here again when I'm in town!",

You'll find favorites such as one minute man, wet dream, and snow in Vegas (which I thought were only at Yama, but it looks like they're here also!)   Here's my favorite favorite part about Sakana. AND I'm sure it's other nigiri lovers' favorite also. THE FISH TO RICE RATIO = BEAUTIFUL. Gorgeous amount of fresh fish on top of a small bed of rice. THATS the best.   Like dessert? Choose an ice cream AND a features dessert on the menu. End it with a not so fishy taste for that sweet tooth!",

That is how it should be. At Sakana when you pay for AYCE sushi you are definitely going to get it here. Their rolls are also tasty, and they have a wide selection.   Service is excellent! Very attentive and finished plates are cleared readily so you could have room for new dishes. Waters always filled, staff say excuse me when they accidentally bump into you, etc.   To top it off they have a wide selection for their dessert! Green tea pana cada had a strong matcha flavor and was very pleasant because it wasn't so sweet. They also have ice cream, mochi ice cream, mini honey toast, and more!   I would definitely recommend this place! Check it out when you're in town (:",

    "text": "Been here so many times and this place never disappoints! I've tried my share of sushi places in town and no place has come close. The icing on the cake is it's all you can eat dinner for $26, including appetizers and desserts. Every single item we ordered was fresh and delicious. Service was perfect and on time with everything we ordered. We always order hot sake and a large Sapporo (and it's always 2 for 1). The beer is always cold and they chill their glasses which makes it that much more refreshing. Appetizers, I highly recommend the jalapeno bomb, baked green mussels, pork belly, spicy garlic edamame, bacon and lobster skewer. For rolls, the summer crunch roll, lemon shrimp roll,  call 911, wet dream and the lobster king roll. Definitely owe it to yourself and try it out for yourself",

I usually don't like all you can eat places because they compromise the quality with the quantity. Not here though . Everything we ordered was fresh. My family is very big fan of sushi and they know good from the bad. Everyone complemented the food.  We had Bon for the server. He is one of the best server we ever had. He was very kind and helpful. Everything was on the table right away . It's hard to get order from so many. My family is demanding. He satisfied everyone. We were very thankful to him. He made our day special .   I strongly recommend this place. The Ocean Trout and Salmon Nigiri were our favorite.  Don't leave without the desert. That's included in the \" all you can eat menu\" .you will not regret leaving some room for desert.",

Compared side to side to Yama Sushi, I think Sakana is little bit higher quality, friendly staff, one suggestion is to add galbi beef short rib and no rice rolls.",

The nigiri rice wasn't that great and the fish was very big pieces. Although it was very good i dont feel like its traditional. The sauces that they used were good. I rank this as maybe my second or third favorite sushi place in town because the experience was a happy one. The one thing I hate the most about going to an AYCE sushi spot is when your service messes up the food experience. Like for example when a server asks if you're sure you will finish what you order but here you don't get that these guys running the show are very nice and they give you suggestions and they accommodate you with a smile. Thanks guys I'll be back or for sure order some lunch since I do work down the street!",

HOW the hell do you not have a way of getting in contact with your employee ? The MANAGER was the one arguing with me very unprofessional like she did not care at all to try and help me and told me she had no number for this worker or any way of finding out who it was . The manager INGRID is a real unprofessional rude lady she shouldn't even be a manager there. They probably take home all of the lost and found for themselves at the end of the night ! But even if that was the case nobody could tell me that. They alll just pretended to be stupid so I drove 30minutes there and 30 minutes back for no reason ! never returning to this place again",

Jason rudely blamed on me that I put the name myself, that's why I didn't get device. I immediately pointed out that he put my name, he did not even apologize and gave me a shitty look.

This restaurant is located adjacent to the Target shopping center on Maryland and Flamingo.  Shout-out to my Yelp pal Gregg W. who just happened to stroll in while we were chowing down!     The ambiance is casual but their food is totally upscale.  I was amazed at how quickly the food came out!  Seriously we must not have waited 2 minutes for our food and it was all hot and fresh and delicious.    Items selected:  Scallop & bacon skewer- Delicious.  Bacon was crispy and scallops were tiny but sumptuous.   Shrimp tempura- Best I've ever had.  Hot, crunchy, salty, delicious.  I could eat them all day.  The shit- wonderful.  Spicy, crunchy, hot, crabby.  I wanted 20 more immediately.  Edamame- Best I've ever had.  Piping hot, salty, perfectly steamed. Yassss.   Chicken fried rice- Wonderful flavor.  Good size portion for AYCE.   Japchae- Stir-fried glass noodles with shredded carrots.  Delicious flavor and piping hot.  Pang- YUCK.  Tastes like hot mayo and crab.  Not for me.  Gagged a little bit.  Something wrong roll- The first sushi I've ever liked.  I'm go glad I tried it.  It had tuna, salmon, and shrimp tempura.  If you go, you have to try this.  I loved it.  Mini honey toast- Amazing.  Toasted block of bread with honey and ice cream.  Get five of these.  The ice cream is something special...it's super white vanilla (like the inside of a Klondike bar).   Get your ass down here if you like sushi...or even if you don't (like me).  This place has made me a believer!",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure I've found my go-to AYCE sushi joint and here in Vegas, there are SOOO many to choose from. Sakana has always been consistent in service, quality and deliciousness!  Dinner AYCE is right under $26 as of 1/2017. The dinner menu has a few things offered that are not included in the lunch price including sashmi rolls, ama ebi, and uni. Otherwise, the rest of the menu is fair game for lunch and dinner. Some of my staple items for Sakana include the garlic tuna and salmon nigiri as well as the Hawaiian and Be Happy rolls.   The service is really quick and efficient here which I love. Once you order your sushi, a blink and it's already in front of you! It's probably more for their sake of turning over customers because the wait and line can be quite extensive but it's still nice to have quick service.  My favorite thing about this place is their fish-to-rice ratio (yes, that's a real thing in case you didn't know). It's a huge slice of decent quality fish with rice. It's one of the best ratios out there, trust.   There are a few dessert menus if you can manage to keep a pocket of stomach for it after your sushi. Only one order allowed per customer though :( they also advertise a 2 for 1 special on beers, wines and house sake all day every day!  Overall, one of my favorite if not the best AYCE sushi place that I've been to here in Vegas and I wouldn't hesitate coming again or recommending it to friends/visitors.",

I sometimes go after school or during my passing period since it's by unlv and wayyy better than yama sushi which is always packed and busy with their chefs yelling at the servers. Their fish to rice portion on their nigiri is perfect!! They aren't stingy with their fish and it's presented beautifully with a leaf under. Their appetizers are unique and flavorful. I'm not a roll person, but from what my friend said they can make a really good California roll because 99% of the places he orders a Cali roll, it's really sad and weak. Service is amazing and they have more dessert options than other places, I love their ice cream tempura!  My favorite thing here is probably the Ono, must try!!",

The place is very small but we got immediately in and seated at 430pm on a Sunday.  Sushi was good quality. AYCE encompasses a large sushi menu. Great fast service .Food was great. A few rolls may be a bit oversauced as others have complained but not enough to make them sloppy and inedible by any stretch of the imagination    My family has eaten sushi all over the US and this was a very pleasant experience.  I can see how there may be a wait in a different time of year as the  place was small.   Do yourself a favor and try them out.  You won't regret it!",

I was impressed with the fish to rice ratio (definitely on the small side) so I was able to order a bunch of nigiri and eat to my heart's content.   Yuzu yellowtail, garlic albabore, salmon, tuna, yellowtail were among my favorites. Baked mussels were good. It's probably one of the first AYCE places that serve yummy tuna! Often times, the tuna is hard and not fresh but not at Sakana.   Only downsides are: seat is quite uncomfortable unless you get to sit at the booths by the wall, plum ice cream tastes like berry, and you don't get a paper to write your orders (the serve comes to take your order).",

I tried the no name roll based on others' recommendation. So yummy! Fish is very fresh which has so been pointed out previously. The service is also promptly and friendly. Sushi came out quickly. I'm not putting this review to get a free drink so rest assured this review is genuine.",

I really liked the music, they were playing Drake and EDM lol, as well as the decoration, it made me feel at a Young Japanese woman's home.   What sets this place apart from other AYCE sushi was the nigiri and the dessert. Most AYCE sushi restaurants will give you a lot of rice and not so much protein, Sakana does the complete opposite, long and thick fillet of protein over a smaller bed of rice. Way more dessert options when buying the AYCE deal, fried bananas, tiramisu, mini honey toast,  tempura ice cream, which are all very small compare to regular dessert but by that time you should be stuffed ( or else you didn't do it right). I would recommend this place, fun environment and good sushi!",

They seat you quickly and take your drinks and food orders almost immediately.  Food comes out relatively fast and there is hardly a problem forgetting orders (problems I have had in the past).  The atmosphere is fun. TVs play Asian pop to create a highly social environment. More music, more food. There is bar seating, table seating, amd one large table for parties of 12 people or more.  Sushi I would recommend: Ocean Trout nigiri, Lisa Lisa, Hulk Burrito  P.S. This review got us a free drink.",

When I go to all you can eat sushi I like to order two rolls to begin with, and as I finish them I will order more one at a time. My waitress, Ingrid, seemed irritated and annoyed every time I would order another roll. Isn't that the point of all you can eat sushi? To order more rolls if you're still hungry because you're paying for all you can eat... Anyways it's a shame because this place is so delicious yet they have servers that lower their reviews.",

I came back here last year and it was not as good as I had remembered from the first few times  I had been here.  We gave it another shot today. Since last time here they have expanded the restaurant, probably because of the business they now get from the 1200+ reviews that are favorable. I am not a fan of overly sauced or creamy things ( no insult to those who love  yum yum, S.O. Sauce, and the like), today everything we had, super white nigiri included was drowning in sauce. I found a hair that was obviously not from anyone at our table. I quietly told the server, and asked her to take that one away. I tried something completely different a bit later and guess what...? Another hair! The manager was consulted and my dinner was taken off of the bill. While I appreciate the effort and the profuse apologies from the servers it just felt like the food quality, cleanliness, and care really left something to be desired. I think sadly Sakana is like  so many other places that go downhill after they become well known. Sorry to say no longer in our rotation of go to restaurants.",

    "text": "Best sushi I've had in the little over two years since I've been here. (Boston transplant, so I'm completely anal about fresh fish!). It was recommended to me by a friend who is a chef from Hawaii, and this place apparently gets their fish flown in from the same pier she used for hers. Works for me!  **Be advised: I was told that they do not have a freezer for fish, so not only is it fresh every day, but when it's gone, it's GONE!** The place is cozy, with a nice atmosphere. At a guess, it accommodates probably 40 people, so if you have a large group, you should DEFINITELY call ahead!   It's a bit tricky to find. It's buried in a tiny corner of a plaza, and pretty much not visible to the street.   They have a fairly long menu, mixed between the usual rolls and appetizers etc. That being said however, they also have some good fried rolls, really nice tweaks to the same old same old, as well as their own creations/specials. The hamachi nigiri is the best I've (almost) ever had. They are generous with the slices, and have much less rice than you'd expect. Bonus  They also offer a really great deal with an AYCE lunch and dinner menu (some exceptions apply), both under $30! It is NOT buffet style, you order through your server, who brings it to your table from the kitchen. No (useless and nasty) sneeze guards here...lol  The biggest reason I didn't give it five stars:  I feel that the majority of the rolls on the AYCE are too similar to each other,  just put together differently and/or with different dressings/sauces. This is especially True of the fried rolls. Still very tasty, but easy to get burned out on quickly.  There are a few other minor things, but that's just due to my own excruciating, agonizing and exacting \"pickiness\"...lol",

The last 4 times we had sushi at a korean/thai owned sushi bar-- every single one of those times, we promised ourselves to NEVER EVER have sushi at any nonjapanese owned restaurant. I gave those 4 restaurants 1 star.  My cousin took me here our first time and as soon as I stepped in, I knew... and I wanted to GTFO. But my cousin was tired and haggard so we decided to eat there.  Yes, before the food came out I had LOW expectations. But the fish was FRESH WTF. AND THE RICE TO FISH RATIO? WTF. I LOVED IT. EVERYTHING. Maybe not their \"popular\" appetizers. Those were... whatevers. I just felt like they were overfilled with imitation crabmeat (sorry, forgot what it was called).  But yes. Go on nigiri. Meh on appetizers. Didn't have their rolls so can't comment. Pricing? Worth it.",

Their rolls are fun and tasty. I love their nigiri it was some of the best I've had in a while at ayce...however the service again wasn't spectacular. We had 3 people at our table and we're only allowed to have one menu. I eventually got them to give me a second menu...they were not busy there was maybe only 3 tables with small parties in there. Regardless a business should have enough menus for their restaurant. Not to mention our server or whoever he was because we had another server come in and take over half way through our meal seemed to have a bad attitude...Not sure if I'll go back  anytime soon due to the poor service.",

There is a bit of a wait usually and the service is synonymous with most AYCE sushi spots..spotty at best. I wasn't expecting much when it came to the service.   The sushi wasn't amazing, but they have a very large selection and a few options that you don't see on the usual all you can eat menu at a sushi spot. Beware of the 911 roll, it is way way hot lol.   Overall, for an AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, its a good option but there are better sushi spots (non AYCE) in Vegas to choose from.",

    "text": "**FYI- because I got a note from a server who was like you don't know about the service industry.   I was in the restaurant business 10 years: typically when someone walks before close they are allowed to order to eat 30 minutes past closing in most restaurants. If there is a last call at 11:30 honor it- I expect a smile and service until 11:29. Servers that don't want people to walk 30-20 minutes before closing ruin diners experiences because they are tired but it is called SERViCE so suck it up or change jobs. I tip well and that server lost  $20 on serving 2 people and my friend refuses to go here again.   You may also notice someone else complimented this post because they had the same experience.  Updated review: Taking all my stars away. We showed up at 111:20 and they didn't want to serve us. They said oh last call is at 11:30. We said ok- we had 10 Minutes and we'd been there before. We were open to ordering 1 big order of sushi fast and they said ok though they didn't want to. We sat down knowing we would be rushed but open but no one came over with an order pad... I mean we just left because it felt like they didn't want our business since it was late.   They were still serving two large parties that we're going to be visiting and stuff..  Usually we come here annually for my friends bday but she never wants to come back now.",

I'll make it simple:  -Freshest fish I have ever had in an all you can eat setting -Enormous cuts when ordering nigiri...almost double thick of other places -Unique dishes like \"the shit\" and \"poki nachos\"  Just look at the photos and check this place out.  Service was lacking a little bit...so sit at the bar and you should be ok. I'll take excellent fish and mediocre service over great service and mediocre fish.  For me to travel from Summerlin across the strip rather than hit all the \"good\" places in Spring Valley says something. This place is great.  Tip: The extra $5 pricing at dinner time allowing you to order the no rice roll options is WELL WORTH IT over the $20.95 lunch price...I'm sure you could go at lunch and ask to pay $25.95 for dinner menu options, the fish is all right there...

Right when we walked in I did not like what ever smell was going on. Second our waiter, who's name I did not get was horrible. Super rude and not at all pleasant. He was a bald asian guy with a bad personality. We got seated and he took down some appetizers from us. When we asked about sushi, he gave us an attitude and said \"I don't take the order, I will bring a piece of paper and you do it yourself\". After that incident, when he came to pick up the paper and read that we had order 8 rolls  (there was four of us). He told us in a really unprofessional way \"you guys ordered 8 rolls, that's a lot of food\". We looked at him like, \"are you for reals right now?\". Anyways after that I asked him if I can please get yellowtail with not bloodline (the red part). Omg he had a fit! He got mad and said he couldn't give me yellow tail belly and bla bla bla. When clearly he was just being too lazy to ask for yellowtail w/ no red. I always order my yellowtail that way at any other sushi place and I never have an issue. Sushi was not bad but also not great. Maybe the good reviews come from the sign they have, if you rate them you get a free drink. I mean a lot of people would do just about anything for a free something... Just saying.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said \"yes\" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.  Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all \"eff it, we're starving, let's eat\".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.    We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:  Chef: Did you just get married? Us: No.  It's been over 6 years. Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.  (a few minutes later)  Chef asks my wife: Is it your birthday? Wife: No it's not. Chef: Well why else would he take you here?  HAHA  (later)  Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here. Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!  So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called \"The Shit\".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.    Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?  I liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.  Lots of reviewers have raved about the fish to rice ratio and it's great.  I would nigiri my way to fullness if we ever came here again.",

But to be honest, I feel like I'm paying more for the selection of food and the fact that if you're staying in a hotel, why not just go downstairs and eat?   My boyfriend and I stayed at the Flamingo for our last night and we pondered the idea of eating at a buffet. But I really just wanted to eat some good, fresh sushi after having so many hand-held meals for the past few days, so luckily we found this place on yelp and came here.   It's about $23/person for dinner (which is half the price of most buffets on the strip). Very cute set up and they even had a valentine's theme for the weekend! Perfect!   Their selection on their AYCE menu was HUGE! Bigger than any of the other places I've been to! Tempura rolls, classic rolls, signature rolls, spicy rolls, nigiri - SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM! My favorite roll was the Orange blossom under their tempura section. Their albacore nigiri is REALLY good too! They've got some garlic ponzu, and tangy sauces that top some of their rolls and nigiri and they did a damn good job with their menu. My boyfriend and I wished we had second stomachs to try everything on their menu!  The only thing I'm sad about is that I live in a completely different state and can't come here whenever I want!",

What was great was that a gentleman who appeared to be the owner came over to our table to ask for drink preferences again and when we told him that we had already been asked, he kindly just said, \"I just wanted to ensure that you were taken care of.\" While most would think why did he ask again, I personally thought that was very kind of him to look after us and make sure that we were taken care of. Following the initial greeting, food went straight into our bellies and there was no looking back. This was already our second time in two weeks and I don't regret a thing. Thank you for your kindness and elite sushi-making abilities ^_____^",

    "text": "Before a recent trip to Vegas, one of my coworkers insisted that I go to Sakana (I'm a big AYCE sushi fan, but I generally set lower expectations and don't expect super high quality sushi at AYCE spots). I was skeptical: the place is AYCE, super affordable, but furthermore, it's in a random strip mall next to a Target on a random street in Vegas. But he insisted because he said it's his must-go spot every time he's in Vegas, and the restaurant has good reviews. When I walked in, the place looked like any other sushi restaurant but when the first plate of sushi came out, I understood why there was so much hype: the pieces of fish are ENORMOUS. They do not skimp on fish here like with most AYCE places, and it's actually pretty high quality as well. I left feeling very satisfied and what's even better: the meal came out to less than $30 - so affordable! I will definitely be recommend this to friends for future trips to Vegas!",

Decor was fun and some odd loved the big plastic floral tree in the center. We did all you can eat 25 bucks per person. Lots to choose from. We did the miso, veggie tempura, variety of nigri and garlic edamame to start. Edamame was flavorful and spicy and each of the nigris we tried were well portioned and not dry with too much rice was great and tasted fresh! Rolls and dishes, we tried a few including No Name roll, Popcorn Lobster Ball, and Sashimi Poke Stack; all were very flavorful and tasted fresh. Service was good as place was so busy they dont really have hostess to greet you but glass was always full with beverage and server stopped by within sufficient time for ordering each time.  We both liked it alot definitely coming back!",

I think both are super high quality and relatively affordable with Sakana at $20.95 / person for lunch.   Favorites: - Garlic Tuna - Seared Salmon Lemon  Skip: - Salmon Roe - Scallop  The fish quality is super high for AYCE sushi. The salmon was super fatty, and the tuna very dark red in color. I would avoid the salmon roe just because it takes up space in your stomach. Also the scallops looked a bit weird due to the way they were cooked, our table mistook it for octopus at first.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch, but thanks to the advice of my fellow Yelpers, I asked to pay the dinner price so that I can have access to the dinner portion of the menu.  Guys, trust me when I say that the extra $5pp is totally worth it as the items from the dinner portion were some of my favorites.    The restaurant was located fairly close to the strip, approximately 10 minutes or so by car.  We arrived soon after the restaurant open and it was fairly empty when we sat down, which worked in our favor as the our server was very attentive, and we were able to place orders at a rapid speed.  The place filled up by the time we left, and the servers were not as readily available toward the end.  Overall, for an AYCE place, the service was good and prompt, there were a handful of busboys nearby that made sure your water glasses are always filled.  The orders also came extremely fast after they were place.  Now, on to the main event, the actual food here.  We tried quite a number of dishes, four appetizers, two yakitori, twelve different kinds of nigiri, two rolls and two desserts.  I guess you can say we got our money's worth!  Most of the dishes we tried were quite good, particularly the rice to fish ratio for the nigiri, which can be problematic at an all you can eat place.  My favorite pieces were the salmon belly, oyster, uni and mackerel, not surprisingly, three of those were dinner only items and you can only order once.  I can eat a whole meal of just salmon belly.    I regret not noticing the \"no rice\" portion of the menu, which was all the way at the end of the back page, until nearly the end of the meal.  I would've tried all of the items on that portion had I found it in the beginning of the meal.  I really liked the Towering Sashimi Poki, the fish tasted fresh and well seasoned.  My least favorite was the deep fried roll, although that was my own fault, as I should've known it would be super heavy given the fact that it was \"deep fried\".  I think the main issue with that dish and most of the appetizers is that they are sooooo heavily drenched in sauce, particularly the creamy aioli prominently featured in nearly all of the none nigiri dishes.  PRO TIP: when placing the order, ask for light sauce, or simply sauce on the side.  Last, but not least, both desserts we ordered were good, but the highlight was the affogato.  It was surprising to find good coffee at a Japanese restaurant, and vanilla ice cream is always a good addition to coffee.    Overall, I thought it was a great meal for the amount that we paid, i.e. $26pp.  I would definitely come back again, and would probably just stick to the nigiri portion of the menu.",

    "text": "Great AYCE in Vegas that isn't all about the meat. Sakana is located off strip but it's a short Uber ride away. I had heard from friends having a great experience at AYCE sushi in Vegas and thought why not give it a try. After reading up on a few different AYCE sushi places, I decided to go with Sakana because of the variety & good reviews.  Sakana is open 7 days a week:  + AYCE Lunch $20.95 (11-3:30 pm)  + AYCE Dinner $25.95 (3pm - midnight) *Pro-tip: even if you arrive during lunch hours, ask to pay for dinner prices since there are items that are only included in the dinner menu and not offered during lunch. Definitely worth the $5 price difference.  As for the food, it was all surprisingly very fresh sushi. The \"No-Rice\" section and select nigiri (salmon belly, oyster, uni, and ama ebi) can only be ordered once and only during dinner (this is where that $5 difference for dinner even if you arrive during lunch hours pays off!). From the \"No rice\" section, I tried the seafood salad, sashimi roll, & stuff tomato. All were very good & fresh although I think I would've preferred to ask for the sauce on the side because it was drowned in spicy ponzu sauce which can get a bit heavy.  The nigiri was good.. I really enjoyed the salmon, tuna, & yellowtail. The Super white tuna was good but again that sauce was a bit too much for me.. I prefer to taste the fish. I decided to try their hand roll & opted for the Batman Burrito which came wrapped in green soy paper. Big mistake as it was so packed full of rice with very little fish that I was instantly full after eating it. Sadly after the Batman Burrito there wasn't any room for dessert although I already had my eyes set on either the Affogato (vanilla ice cream w/ Korean style coffee) or Green Tea Panna Cotta.  Staff is diligent in making their rounds, clearing empty dishes, and asking if you'd like to order more. It's a great spot for groups (they have 2 for 1 special on alcohol all day, 7 days a week). They accept credit cards but not Amex.",

    "text": "Sakana is an all-you-can-eat venue where you can choose from a variety of nigiri and sushi rolls as well as hot and chilled apps and mini-entrees. At $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner, I find it to be quite a bargain even if the quality isn't necessarily the best.  I came during the mid-afternoon and found a fair number of diners in the venue, but also plenty of open seats, so I had no issues with long waits. You can order three items at once, and they turned out my selections amazingly fast.  Each order of nigiri has 2 pieces which only multiples the feeling that you're getting an abundance of food at an awesome price. OK, items like the salmon, surf clam, red snapper, and eel didn't taste like the freshest cuts ever. In fact, there was an overall sogginess to both the fish and the rice, and some of the pieces came drowning in sauce, but they didn't taste \"off\" or awful either. Maybe the fact that I experienced no discomfort or food poisoning afterwards is a low hurdle to clear, but nothing about the fish or their preparation methods was alarming or concerning.  If you like saucy rolls, whether spicy, sweet, or both, you'll definitely have a blast here. Again, it's AYCE, although in general some selections are not available during the slightly cheaper lunch hours. Hot items like the chicken karaage and bulgogi beef were just a tad excessively fried or doused in sauce, respectively, but again in this one case I'm willing to sacrifice a fair bit of quality and authenticity in exchange for the sheer quantity.  Better yet, they were running 2 for 1 drink deals when I stopped by. So two back-to-back beers were a great way to wash things down.  I've had my fair share of super high-end sushi and Japanese fare and am therefore willing to pay up accordingly. But I can also appreciate what a good value places like Sakana offer even if the quality isn't first-rate. Overall, for me this was a decent, fully satisfying experience.",

My super picky thing about sushi is the fish-to-rice ratio. I don't like a lot of rice. It was the best you could ask for here, totally unexpected at a AYCE. I also appreciate that the fish really stood out and wasn't over sauced in their offerings.  I don't know what the comments about bad service are about. Maybe it's a level of friendliness that other reviewers are hoping for and not understanding Asian demeanor in general? Service was outstanding and ridiculously fast.   Only negative, the tiramisu is very Asian=not rich or decadent. If you are wanting anything like traditional tiramisu, it's not for you. And the green tea panna cotta is way too small!",

    "text": "the food deserves a 5/5 because it's always so delicious and very flavorful. i really recommend the spider roll. i know it sounds super basic but it was a sweet kick to it that makes it very savory.  the service deserves a 3/5. although they have a lot of waiters and people in charge of taking orders, everything came out relatively fast and easy. the one thing i do have to say is that our waiter had a very unappealing attitude towards us. the waiter looked quite annoyed as they were taking our orders. we sat in a big group filled with around 8 people and the waiter looked annoyed the entire time. the waiter's attitude very much ruined most of my appetite because the waiter gave off a vibe that did not welcome us at all. not only did i lose my appetite but the people around me also did too. this is my favorite sushi spot in the entire world and it is an all you can eat if you decide to make that purchase. i came all the down to vegas for the sushi because i loved it so much but i'd hate to have it ruined by just an unwelcoming presence. overall the restaurant is super good and very recommended.",

The nigiri sushi seemed to be small to average size. Definitely not large like some of these post. I also had a coke but it was from a can. No fountain soda refill here. Being an all you can eat sushi bar usually they would have free refills. No one even asked if I wanted another coke. Staff was nice but didn't have that welcoming feel or check up on me until I was ready to leave. Probably won't go back since I had very high expectations from their reviews.",

    "text": "The best AYCE sushi I've had. Service wasn't the best or most attentive I've had, even for AYCE, but the FOOD omg. Amazing. I was visiting some friends who live in Vegas and I mentioned that I was craving AYCE sushi and this was their suggestion. At $25 for dinner pricing, you can definitely say I got my money's worth. We came at around 5PM and were able to get seated right away but it got busy right as we were leaving a bit after 6. I would probably say if you want the full dinner menu, come earlier in the evening otherwise you'll end up crammed into the doorway waiting for a table. It's also a fairly small-ish space so it's probably easier if you don't come with a super huge group.   Sakana had so many options on their AYCE menu that I didn't even know where to start. You can also order items a la carte off the menu here but if you eat more than 2 rolls typically you're just better off doing AYCE price wise. Typically for AYCE I think nigiri is usually better than rolls because there's less filler but even the rolls at Sakana were good and had the perfect amount of rice.   I ordered the chicken karaage, Hawaiian roll, spider roll, and copious amounts of nigiri but my favorite by far was the cajun tuna. I don't even know what's on it (fried onion, some spices) but omg I could have ordered nothing but those all night and been happy. The seared lemon salmon nigiri was also good. Everything here was good, who am I kidding? We finished everything off with some green tea ice cream which really hit the spot.   My advice for eating here is to just go ham. Is it really AYCE sushi if you don't hate yourself by the end of the meal? I will definitely be back and plan on hating myself even more next time.",

I have been here for so many times and first got bitter Uni. I told the server, she took the Uni away but didn't gave me any explanation back for the bitterness.

A lot of the sushi places along Flamingo and China Town have had a reputation for being outdated but I prefer to look at them as classics. I recently came back after not having eaten there for about 4 years. The staff were very police and friendly. The sushi and appetizers tasted amazing. The only issue keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is the small detail of the staff not being cognizant of our drinks. My wife and I finished our glass of water after the first few rolls and the staff never seemed to realize it. Again, it's a small detail since they refilled our glass immediately after we asked and they always brought out orders in a prompt manner. Aside from the water thing, I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area.",

It is a bit out of the way from the strip, but it is definitely worth a Uber/Lyft ride to visit them.  The first good sign was a constant stream of people waiting to get into the restaurant. The lines were never huge, but give yourself 30 minutes for the queue.  Their menu consists of more than 80 items, and you are welcome to other them a-la-carte, but there is an All You Can Eat dinner option for $25.95. There are limits on certain items (like the Uni Sushi), but with so much to choose from, it really doesn't matter too much. Their Nigiri all tasted fresh and delicious, with just a tiny amount of rice on each serving (which was really impressive given that it is AYCE). They also had robata, normal rolls, fried rolls, baked rolls, appetizers, desserts... honestly we were a bit overwhelmed and only managed to get through 30% of the menu before we were full.  The service was also great, with our server constantly checked up on us to see if wanted more food.   Oh, and our Top Pick: The Seared Salmon Nigiri!!!   #vancouverfoodie #vancouvereats #vancouverfood #vancityeats #vancityfood #604eats #604foodie #yvreats #yvrfoodie #vancityfoodie",

As soon as you open the door and walk in, the place is hoppin and the decor is awesome.    We were able to get a table immediately on a Thursday night.  For $25, it's definitely worth a visit.  There are a few things on the menu that are limited to one per person:  Uni Ocean trout Salmon belly Oyster Amaebi  I'd recommend getting those first and out of the way.  We're nigiri peeps so we definitely prefer those over rolls.  We did get a couple rolls though and weren't disappointed.  I thought the fish to rice ratio was good for an AYCE spot.  Probably the freshest AYCE stuff I've had out here.  Service was super quick.  They help each other out so there's always someone checking on you.    For the price and quality, you can't go wrong.",

We were not disappointed.   Sakana was fairly busy on the weeknight that we dined there, we were lucky enough to get the last available table. Despite being packed, service was really good, our server seemed to pop up just as we were ready to order more food. The food we ordered came out rather quickly as well.   I always appreciate when AYCE sushi spots allow customers to order half rolls so you get to try more, and Sakana does. We tried: -Monkey Brain: This has tempura banana which sure sounds a little funky, but it worked. -Japanese Lasagna: So creamy and delicious. We ended up getting a second (half) order. -Vegas roll: Because according to my visiting friend, you have to when in  Vegas... Sakana's version is good but not the best I have ever had. -Lemon Shrimp roll: Another one we had to get seconds on. -The Shit: The menu says it's a must try. The menu doesn't lie.  -Bacon and Lobster skewer: I'd skip this next time. -Mini honey toast: One dessert item per person is included in AYCE.  Sadly Sakana is not in an area I get too often so it may be a while before I get back, but based on my experience it's worth going to again!",

My best friend introduced me to this place maybe 2-3 months before I moved back to the Bay Area and I wanted to kick myself in the butt for not going more often because this place is absolutely amazing. SO MANY CHOICES! So many appetizers, nigiri, rolls, and everything else! Not gonna lie- first time I came here I felt overwhelmed. There was so much options, I did not know what to choose from. Luckily, I was with my best friend who is an expert. She chose all of the things that she liked, which I also really enjoyed. Everything was delicious, the fish is really fresh. My favorites are the super white tuna (I would literally order just this if I could) and the popcorn lobster roll. For the AYCE price I think you really get the bang for your buck. Dessert is also really good. I enjoyed everything! I definitely think of coming back here often and it's for sure one of my go to places whenever I come to visit. If you haven't been here before- please try it. It is absolutely worth the money!!!",

It took about 30-40 mins after putting my John Hancock down on the clipboard. The aesthetics of the place is pretty whimsical, it had a Japanese feel to it with the cherry blossoms.  Customer service was good too. The servers were consistent throughout the night. They are attentive to take out plates when finish or fill up your cup, and will come by at the right time to take your next set of orders.   The sushi was fantastic, especially the uni and the mackerel, delicious. The sushi pieces were bigger than I expected. The miso soup was a good starter in addition to the bugogi nachos, which had a surprising sweetness to it.   My family and I definitely enjoy this place and will be coming back many times more.  *will post photos later",

Not the best sushi by any means. Not authentic sushi either. And everyone orders those rolls with lots of sauces. So this isn't the traditional Japanese sushi place but I'm very open about what everyone likes and this place offers so many variety of sushi and rolls and appetizers that if you like the nigiri sushi purist, they have halibut or tuna, or if you like that dynamite rolls (Baked scallop with mayonnaise and sweet sauce) or dragon roll they have that. They also have very suggestive kinky rolls which is kinda funny but appropriate for Vegas. And the price is under $30. Way better deal than the hotel buffet and better service and quality.   Again not the most authentic sushi place.  Not very Japanese. But I ordered some agedashi tofu, tempura, udon, miso soup, salad, and beef steak as well as many nigiri (halibut, yellow tail, tuna, mackerel, and all the Japanese items too).  I used to enjoy hotel buffet, but with all the parking fee and resort fee; Vegas isn't the place I used to enjoy. This sushi joint brought back some of my old Vegas style. Thank you!",

I like that they don't limit you too much but they are watching your fish intake which is a little annoying.  Besides that, the sushi chefs were super friendly and the whole experience was awesome!",

    "text": "Very good AYCE sushi place. I went with my family around 4:30pm and the wait was not very long. I did see a lot of people waiting after 5pm.   Overall the food is very good. Not just the sushi, even all the cooked food was really good. I really liked the chicken karagee and udon soup. The katsu curry is very tasty too. I like how the portions are small so you can order variety to try. All the nigiri was good. Coming from CA where we have very good sushi, this is comparable. It's rare for an AYCE. I really enjoyed the salmon belly and very white tuna. They give a big piece of fish with a small amount of rice, which is very nice. The rolls are about the same as everywhere else. The potions are normal. I liked the double dragon roll. The deserts were also very good. The ice cream with Korean coffee was super yummy. Highly recommend.   The only complaint is that the service is not the friendliest, hence one star off. The lady taking our order didn't smile or anything. When we asked for recommendations, she didn't really care to give any. Also they didn't have uni the day we went, which is disappointing. The food also took awhile to come to the table after ordering. So I do suggest order a lot in the first round.",

If you eat a lot I would recommend the all you can eat, the bill can stack up pretty fast between sushi, appetizers, deserts, etc.   The place itself is pretty nice but the service was definitely not the best. Didn't feel welcomed at all. Our waiter and busboy was not nice. I would say, \"thank you\" after everything they would do for our table and they never even acknowledged it. Our waiter didn't refill our beverages unless we asked. They almost forgot one of our desserts.  Overall, if you live on that side of town I would recommend this restaurant if you want some good sushi but definitely not worth the drive if you life on the other side of town.",

We go to either of these restaurants when we crave sushi. They have an AYCE option, which includes dessert.  Whenever we try other sushi places, I still think Sakana/Neko are better. Idk if it's because I'm bias or the quality is just actually better. We introduced this restaurant to our family and now whenever they come into town, they wanna eat here. This restaurant is very popular and is usually busy. So prepare to wait if you're coming during rush hour.",

No complaints here.  For desserts, I'd stay away from the green tea ice cream. For some reason it didn't taste that great...almost tasted like clay/play-doh which is strange.

Dinner is $26 which is a steal in my opinion.  The service here is fast and friendly. Waiters are constantly patrolling their areas and fulfill your requests quickly. Once your order is placed, the food comes out pretty quickly so you aren't waiting long at all. There are a TON of options on the menu and I was very impressed with the fish-to-rice ratio. I can guarantee that you will not leave this place hungry. I can't stand an AYCE sushi place that gives too much rice and they get it right here. My favorites were the uni and salmon belly. I appreciated the thick cuts of nigiri. Sushi for days!!  I'm so glad I found this place. I can't wait to come back when I'm in town!",

I subtracted a star because when it was time for me to leave no one offered me desert and I thought that came with the AYCE. I would say their appetizers selection was the biggest I had seen. Also, the fried sushi was in a pancake like batter instead of a panko crumb I'm used too in California. I ordered a spicy salmon and got a salmon roll with jalapeno on top!!! WTH. Again, I'm used too soaked fish in spicy seasoning. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. I was done after trying 4 different roles. I need to come here with someone who knows the rolls.

Uni and Salmon belly were out so we were kinda disappointed. Oysters and Amaebi were just ok not amazing. They're both a one time only item for AYCE but trust me you won't need more than once. Beverages weren't included in the AYCE. Favorite items were the Ocean Trout, Yellow Tail, Ikura, and Tuna. Some pieces were a little too saucy as the sauce overpowered the fish taste. The Yakitori was good.  Service was pretty fast and staffs were all busy so didn't get time to chat much, but understandable as this place seemed to have very heavy traffics even approaching the closing time. The wait was longer than told around 20 mins so please make yourself prepared for that.",

Firstly, the fish was very fresh, and everything was made to order. Once inside, we were informed that if you were to do their AYCE option, everyone at the table must comply. Not a problem, because everything on their menu, from appetizers to desserts are included. Warning, they make you pay for leftovers, which includes eating the fish off the rice and leaving the rice behind (so come hungry!!!). They have an amazing variety of specialty rolls, and lots of delicious creations across the board. Their list of nigiri was lengthy, and the staff was exceedingly friendly in both service and explanation of different menu items. I will totally go back when I return to Vegas.",

If it wasn't for the attitude from some of the waiters and weird furniture arrangement, I would have given Sakana 5 stars instead of 4.  Now, let's talk about price and get it out of the way. The price is very similar to most AYCE sushi joints, $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner.   What about the food? Luv it!!!! Their rice to fish ratio is awesome and the best I've seen so far. The fish was fresh and the portion is plentiful. I highly suggest you try the Salmon Kama, it's the bomb.  Like I mentioned earlier, what I don't like about this place is their service and furniture layout. Some of the staff are nice, but most of them barely cracked a smile (including the owner lady) and they gave the \"order one time, eat fast and get out\" kinda look. In term of furniture, their setup created a bottleneck and make wait time extra long. In their not so big dinning area, they have a long table that can seat probably 12 - 14 people in the middle of the dinning room and I rarely see this table being occupied. They also have a lot of 4-people tables which they don't like to seat party of two, therefore it ended up with a whole bunch of 2 party groups waiting to be seated while there are empty tables. I hope my description makes sense :-)  Overall, I still like Sakana and most likely will go for lunch since it's less busy and don't have to wait long for a table.",

After reading the reviews, I picked this spot and was not disappointed, although I'm sure we were overdressed. Didn't care though. We went later at night, around 9 pm, and the place was CROWDED. Lots of waiting people, but since we were a two-person party we got seated fairly quickly.  The four-person party to the left of us was horrid to our server, constantly throwing their hands up and complaining about how they've \"been coming here for years\" and saying that there were ingredients on their sushi rolls that was never there before, or asking why it's \"spicy\" when it was never spicy before. One such item clearly listed it was spicy in the menu. I felt sorry for our server but he at least didn't allow himself to be bullied.   We were as easy to handle as we could make ourselves. There were constant checks on how we were doing by our server, the busboy, and other servers. We shared a sake and it was delicious. We ordered four or five times throughout our time and weren't kept waiting for too long at least. There were some regulars next to us on the right side, a pair of friends who I could tell were regulars (not like the other party) because the servers all said hey to them and knew their orders. They also ordered the classy, expensive, simple stuff. Because it was our first time, I kept it pretty basic and tried a little of everything--a few fancy rolls, a basic one, grilled shishkabobs, nigiri, and sashimi. I wasn't disappointed.    Excited to come again. Highly recommend this place for the freshness and vast selection.",

We were pretty over it by the time actually got to sit at one of the empty tables.  AC wasn't working well. Music was loud and odd. We won't be back.  They offer a free drink for Yelp reviews.

They're also kinda close to the strip so that's super convenient if you're staying in one of the hotels there. They have A LOT of different types of sushi and everything is so good here. My favs are the gyoza, salmon belly, super white tuna, garlic(?) tuna, squid and even the regular salmon. They have even more options for rolls. They charge ~$26 per person for dinner and I think that is such a great price for what you get. The portions are really good, they're not like those places that give you sooo much sushi rice and the tiniest piece of fish that makes you full (of rice) before you even order the second round. The food is amazing and the servers here are super nice. The only downside of this place is that their bathroom is a MESS and so dirty every time I go. And also, their phone number doesn't work when I tried to call and I tried over 5 times.",

I only had the nigiri and I tried: Garlic tuna, salmon, albacore, red snapper, smoked paprika salmon, fresh water eel, tamago, sarada lobster, ikura, ocean trout, salmon belly, oyster, uni, ama ebi. Noteable mentions are: salmon is so juicy with amazing fish to rice proportion, salmon belly - get in my belly, garlic tuna, and uni is passable for ayce uni (most places aren't). Things for me to avoid: red snapper, tamago, ama eni - just aren't to my taste / too fishy. Red bean ice cream was delicious. Green tea ice cream and black sesame blanc manger were decent enough. Can I also mention that the service was super quick? Things came out in 5 minutes or less and servers checked up on me every 10 minutes.   Coming from a guy who lives in Los Angeles -HOW DO YOU GET FRESH FISH FOR SO CHEAP IN LAS VEGAS??  Update: Came here again the next day.  Additional things to get: Kurobota Sausage, Mushroom. MINI HONEY TOAST.  Stay away: yakitori (just too filling)  Honorable mentions/okay: green tea panna cotta, super white tuna (unique taste), Cajun tuna, tobiko",

Many of the orders are limited like I can only order one salmon belly, and ice cream? And the sweet shrimp only has one piece per order? Really?   Tuna was not fresh when I was there and they charge you for hot tea and refills. And if you guys look closely enough. All of their sushis have some kind of sauce on them,you know what that means? That means the fish is not fresh and they are putting sauce to cover the unfreshness.  The \"special\" dessert doesn't taste good.  The only good thing was the tempura ice cream.  Even thought they charge less per person for AYCE but with all these hidden fees and limitations on what you can order the bill comes out to be the same as other Better AYCEs.   I'd rather pay more to eat better quality sushi than this place.",

We tend to stick to the fundamentals - salmon, maguro, hamachi, unagi, etc. - and have never been disappointed here.  There is typically a 20 or so minute wait but worth it.  In my experience, AYCE sushi sellers ration what you eat by serving you much more slowly than you would otherwise order and eat, and sometimes limit your total table time on top of that.  In the case of the other reviews where the server \"forgot\" to fill orders, I suspect this may have been by design.  In any case, I'm usually right around breakeven vs. AYCE by the time I'm full and my wife is usually short of breakeven, so a la carte works for us.",

The Korean lady who i believe is the manager showed the worst customer service I have ever experienced. There were many mistakes that happened with our order but that didn't bother me much. The problem was the customer service and how the manager handled the situation which could have all been avoided with a simple sincere apology.   For example, i ordered 2 orders of unagi but was given 6 orders. That can happen, we are all humans and we make mistakes. To keep the long story short, throughout the whole time we were there, the orders were not given correctly. I don't mind that; however, the big problem was the way the Korean lady approached us. She had the courage to say to us, \"this is why you shouldn't have ordered this much food\" with attitude. First, she didn't take our order so how does she know if we ordered that much food or not. Second, she didn't even apologize for the way she treated the customers. We had no problem with the guy servers. They were very professional and showed excellent customer service. Especially as a manager, she shouldn't make accusations when she doesn't even know the facts. She needs to go through re-training on customer service. No idea how she is the manager for this place. My party and I wanted to clarify with the manager once we paid our bills in full, but she didn't want to approach us to resolve the problem. I usually don't write negative reviews about the places I go to, but I need to spread the word about this Korean lady who is suppose to be the manager. Very disappointed with how she showed customer service. I am sorry to say, she needs to step down in being a manager. Now it is time to find a new place to to eat sushi.",

    "text": "This place is fun! A friend I work with introduced me to Sakana a few months ago and we decided to eat here again on NYE, calling it the best last meal of the year.  I've never really cared for AYCE sushi places and usually can't put away a huge quantity of food in one sitting.  So on the rare occasions I go this route I'm usually depending on the help of my gluttonous dining partners.  The nice thing about this menu is anything goes, it includes the rolls, nigiri, sashimi, appetizers, dessert, the entire thing. The only thing separate is the drink.    We got the towering sashimi poke, sooo gooooood, we ordered a couple more.  Also consumed: pork belly, chicken curry, salmon collar thing I forgot what it's called,  green tea panna cotta, red bean ice cream, black sesame blanc manger, green tea ice cream.... The following double order of nigiris: salmon belly with fresh wasabi, super white tuna (in some awesome sauce I can only imagine is awesomesauce and/or has crack in it), and 300 albacore.  We ate and ate and ate, it was terrible, it was good.  And the sushi chef Dragon is a badass.  He's hilarious, fast, and my friend notified him of my mango allergy and he was careful to make sure nothing killed me.  When the first towering sashimi poke rolled out, it had mango on it and Dragon remembered my allergy, pulled the plate, and got us another, safer, one. This place is literally \"eat all the things!\"",

You get to try uni, oysters, and some salmon Belly (even though you can only order one for the taste.)  but all the recommended item , must try item , and the one time only are really good! (Although they are pretty Americanized)   The salmon egg are good as well!(not everyone likes it though) We ate a lot of those. Usually other all you can eat restaurants, they give you lot of rice trying to fill you up .... but this one has little rice. We only tried two rolls and we finished it, but most of our order is nigiri(we ordered a lot ). FYI Usually rolls fill up faster  In conclusion ~~~ we finished everything that we ordered, didn't have those I don't like this dish feeling.",

I will be back oh did i mention lunch is 20.95 and dinner is 22.95!",

Sushi is my favorite food and I worked in a sushi restaurant for awhile, so I have quite a bit to compare it to.  Prices were perfect. Specialty rolls average  10-12 dollars. Drinks are buy one get one all day, I believe. They have an awesome all you can eat special as well.   We ordered a la cart. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, The Playboy, The Chanel, and the Burning your ass roll, as well as a miso soup and a seaweed salad. We both had water to drink and the bill was only $46. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the rice to fish ratio was incomparable.   Our service was friendly and quick, and the place was very busy.

The place wasn't very busy--we ate at 3PM--so I felt they might have been bored. But whatever the reason, good to know I had someone to help if I needed it. The food came out pretty quick. They had all you can eat, but I optied out, since theres no way I can eat $20 of sushi. Edanamme was awesome. Sushi was awesome. Bulgogi nachos were awesome. Don't miss out on this chance of awesomeness.    One less star for: 1) $8.00 pint of beer is ridiculous, but whatever, I'm on vacation. DON'T buy the beer, go to Walgreens or Target.",

The quality is fresh and their portioning is ridiculously generous for the rate they charge for their AYCE (Lunch: $20.95, Dinner:22.95). I'm obsessed with salmon and I need you to know that you MUST order their salmon nigiri. Our server was very attentive and our orders came in a very timely manner. I suggest you try them out before this hidden gem gets too popular and you can't get a seat! I'm definitely going back to try their limited dinner items!",

I eat sushi on a frequent basis and I always make sure I order the dynamite appetizer; a baked mixture of mushrooms,seafood, masago and mayonnaise... Sooo good (when it is made properly). I ordered the dynamite and it tasted sour almost like fermented milk. I ended up sending it back and the manager (I guess) came out and told me he tasted the food (which I took bites off of and spit back into the bowl btw) and he said \"I tasted the food and I just wanted to let you know it didn't taste sour.\" #1. Don't assume that just because I am black I don't know what a proper serving of dynamite is suppose to taste like. #2. I come here all the time and it has never tasted like that. #3. Everyone's taste buds aren't the same. #4. What were you looking to gain from telling me my opinon was wrong? #5. Are you paying for my meal? To add insult to injury he asked us how many checks we wanted, we clearly said one, the waiter comes back with two and when we clarify again that we wanted one, he slams one of the check trays on top of the other, slids them off of the bar and then lightly tosses our final check in front of us. They never have to worry about me sending food back again because I won't be returning.",

Price is the same as most ayce sushi restaurants. But what makes this place so good? I have to say their nigiri is really fresh, big cuts of fish on top of a little bit of rice. I love that they give less rice than any other sushi restaurant because it allows you to eat more and try more. My favorites are the unagi nigiri and sake nigiri. I often get the miso soup, garden salad, bacon n asparagus skewer, Hamachi kama, japanese lasagna, seaweed salad, creamy Shrimp and the list goes on! Portions are all small so you can try lots of things. My only complaint is that they often forget my orders on a bad day but on a good day, the food comes out immediately after you order! Have to say though, a few times I saw the sushi chef lick his fingers but ehhh what are you gonna do. I still love the food. Oh and let's not forget the mango mochi!",

    "text": "It's much better than the other 2 sushi restaurant I went in Vegas. I notice there are dozens of \"Japanese restaurants\" but they are mostly Korean run and not as Japanese style. But this one is less K style which means much better service overall.   If you know Korean tone, there are mostly Korean run (even chefs) in this country nowadays, especially in Hawaii. It's not just about originality, it's just lacking of True Japanese service and spirits. Some even greet you back in Korean after you pay the bills.  They also want you to eat all the rice or a charge, but the rice portion is smaller than usual Korean, fake Japanese restaurants. And they don't fake that they ran out of uni in the early dinner time where some always do that.  This is the first Korean run, Japanese food I will recommend to people. Happy buffet eater here.  If you love authentic Japanese style of food, avoid their recommendations on the menu. I'm just repeating the same comments as other older reviews.",

Actually most of them are too large for the rice on the bottom, which is awesome. We had super white tuna, salmon belly, ocean trout, and seared salmon, and all of them were amazing. The Uni too was very good and sweet. They had very good pork belly as well. The 911 roll was also good and they are not playing when they say it's spicy (habanero alert). They also do half rolls (not just at the end) so that's nice. The mini toast for dessert is as good as all the yelpers say. If you love AYCE sushi this spot should be on the top of your list.",

    "text": "Sakana sushi is by far my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. It not only has a nice and fun atmosphere, the service is usually quick, the wait to be seated isn't long, and the food and drink are the best.   The price is like all the rest around town $25/pp for all you can eat appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls and dessert (lunch is a few bunch cheaper but you can't get a few of my favorite items at lunch); and the drinks are around $8/each but it's buy one get one free.   I love this place because they have items that many other places don't have like the salmon belly and ocean trout nigiri (@ dinner only, but a must have). Their nigiri is great because they don't put a lot of rice with the fish that they serve.  Their rolls are great too; my favorite being the Something Wrong Roll (Shrimp Tempura and spicy Soft Shell Crab inside, with Tuna, Salmon and White fish on the outside in a garlic ponzu sauce). I like their rolls because it's not like a lot of other sushi places where the inside of the roll is almost always that fake crab/mayo/gross mix lol.   They also have a large selection of soups, salads and appetizers all of which are great. I recommend the cucumber crab salad, I usually have a few of these and of course a seaweed salad to go with.  To finish it all off they have a wide dessert selection with all the basic ice creams and mochi, plus tiramisu, tempura ice cream, honey toast and my new favorite korean coffee over vanilla ice cream.",

The service here was at times slow but our server was super nice. We got the all you can eat option.  Order the shit it is really freakin good.  I would have given this place a 5 if it had not been for two things first I would have really liked it if they used less rice. 2nd they use way to much mayo based sauce and they put a lot of sauce in the dishes.  I don't know if they do this because people that eat sushi in the area want the sushi to be masked with sauce or it was just overkill. Either way you can not beat the price you pay for the food you eat. The toasted bun with ice cream is great and the red bean ice cream is good too and sake!!!!!! Two for one is awesome",

The fish to rice ratio is superb! And AYCE is only $21 at lunch and $26 at dinner. I went here as sooned as it opened, seated right away and ordered right away.

The atmosphere is hip and laid back, plus the service is commendable. I'm more of a nigiri ordering customer, but I find myself enjoying their rolls. They don't stuff their sushi with too much rice so you're able to try more things. Take advantage of the AYCE menu and order their yummy appetizers!",

I could never have kept that sort of positive attitude if I was working late at night, so I give mad props to them for that.   Food: the fish was fresh, hand rolls were awesome, portions were good; nigiri's rice to fish ratio was perfect (I don't like too much rice), and the mochi for dessert was a bonus.   Comparisons: I've only been to one other AYCE sushi place in Vegas, which was Yama sushi, and which I felt sucked in comparison. The only type of AYCE place I preferred to this one is one I went to in NJ, which had all the rolls, sashimi, nigiri, seaweed salad, and other stuff out in a buffet, so you could pick and choose how much you wanted of each thing instead of having to order a half roll or whole roll like these AYCE sushi places where its made after ordering.",

    "text": "My fiance and I originally drove to this side of town to eat at Yama, but the wait was over an hour. We found Sakana on yelp and after viewing the reviews we decided to try it out.   Upon our arrival, there was confusion about where the line was or if the hostess took names. We were seated about ten minutes later.   The decor in this place is a little confusing. The ambiance is that of a college dorm, with chalk board walls and beer signs. The seats are wooden with no backs.  We ordered appetizers first which came out in 3-5 mins. Then we decided to order rolls and we waited for over 30 mins! The waiter kept apologizing for the wait.   After waiting we only received one out of four rolls that we ordered and by that time we were ready to leave.  We waiting another 20 mins for the waiter to bring us our check.   Over all experience;  The service was awful, the table next to us kept getting their rolls promptly and we waited. The place is unorganized when it comes to service, they kept bringing the wrong rolls to the table next to us.  The food was decent. The cuts of fish were big and rice portions small.   Save yourself the 26.99 and go to Yama sushi or Sushi Mon. Those are my go to places and this will be the last time I try a new sushi spot.",

    "text": "just had dinner at Sakana, I have been here a few times before and I really enjoy the food, but I found that the service can be hit or miss. we got there tonight around 7:30pm they had a bit of a wait and a packed house. the wait wasn't bad, I only wish they had a bigger waiting area, it's very crowded, but it was no big deal.there was also no hostess there to greet anyone when they walk in,no hello or asking how many,  or giving you a time estimate,just a piece of paper to sign in and write your name. we started with salads and appetizers, my husband (Geoff)had a seaweed salad, I had the sashimi salad and for appetizers we got The Shit, Dragon Balls and the Towering Sashimi Poke. Geoff loves seaweed salad and eats it whenever he gets the chance, he said it was pretty average,not the best,but not the worst, just average. the sashimi salad I did enjoy, it looks gorgeous, I love the presentation but it didn't blow my mind, but it was good for sure. the shit comes highly recommened it's fried, it has a yummy sauce, what's not to love. the dragon balls are mushrooms with lobster mix deep dried,very yummy. now, the Towering Sashimi Poke o...m..g! so good!!!!!!! it comes on a lil fried wonton chip with crab mix and some poke and a lil like salsa mix on top it's fresh and yummy definitely get the towering poke!we ordered it twice it was so good. the service was better this time than it has been for me in the past. other times I felt completely forgotten about as far as refills are concerned tonight was much better. still a couple times they almost gave us someone else's food, but it was quickly figured out and resolved,they were very busy with lots of servers and busers running around so I can see how a lil confusion can happen. next we got the sashimi roll, the summer crunch roll and the honey screaming O. I liked all of them my fav though was summer crunch, it's lobster mix deep fried with some other goodness, they are lil balls of heaven or as Geoff says \"a tasteplosion in my mouth\" the screaming O was different than I thought it would be from the other pics on <a href=\"http://yelp.it\">yelp.it</a> was good, but I was a lil disapointed that it wasn't what I <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexpected.im&s=9efd1941adaaf50a3b7bbb2286d96f00746dd33fe3b77aad43f8189a3195aff4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected.im</a> still on the hunt for the one ive seen in other yelp pics.next we had the Chanel roll and the Be Happy roll. I really loved the Chanel, it has assorted fish on top, crab and tempura shrimp inside and screaming o sauce, it was yummy. our server also said it was his fav. by the time the be happy roll came I was so full lol! it was similar to chanel as far as sauce and assorted fish but it had fried soft shell crab inside instead of crab mix. this was the first time I have ever tried soft shell crab, it wasn't bad. it was a Lil chewy from the shell of the crab I think. it was different but it was good. finally we had the tempura ice cream, also a first for me it was pretty good. it's small so perfect to share after you are full of sushi lol. just a lil sweet treat to end the night. it had a funnel cakeiness to it that I liked. we actually ordered the summer crunch a second time, for the last round but it never came, we ended up being really full anyhow so we didnt say anything.i gotta say even though the service sometimes irritates me, I love sakana. they have so much to choose from and they are always coming up with new and interesting things. and they really take pride in presentation. the  Chanel roll and be happy were very pretty! i just wish they would tighten up their customer service a  little bit.like i had to ask for my first refill of ice tea, when he was right there when we ordered the 2nd round, my glass was empty but he didnt seem to notice, so i asked the next time he came back. and he did do it after that without asking (i drink a lot of ice tea lol), but I don't want to have to ask at all, especially if you are standing right there and my glass is empty, notice and offer a refill, it's why I am going to leave you a good tip. tonight was better than times before, but there is still room for improvement.i wish i could leave a 3.5 star thats really what i want to do.just  a star and a half to improve service a little bit. next up on my bookmark list is Yama sushi, close by sakana. I wanna see how they compare to each other. really I wanna find the best sushi spot in vegas, maybe it's sakana, maybe it's somewhere else , i dunno, but I am gonna find it lol.",

Most places' menus are heavy on the rolls (sauced up and fried usually) but Sakana has loads of options, many nigiri sushi to choose from and tons of apps. We didn't even put a dent in the menu! There's so much I wanted to try but was too full to get to. Next time!  The service was quick even though the place was packed. There was a short wait for a table but not bad. Dinner was $25.95 and if you can eat at least two rolls on your own (I mean who can't?) then the AYCE option is worth the price.  Awesome rice to fish ratio--I know that's important, esp cheap asses like me who want to get their money's worth (even though my dining companion treated me LOL). They do only allow one order of each for certain items, namely uni, amaebi, oyster, and salmon belly (I think). The uni was hit or miss. A couple pieces were really nice and sweet. The others not so much. Also the fried heads of the amaebi had too thick of batter and the head itself didn't taste so fresh (again, one was good, the other not).  The hamachikama (collar) was tiny and kinda fishy. Not what I'm used to. But there were plenty of items that were great and we got multiples of. The unagi was one of my faves.   The staff are very attentive since they want a fast turn over rate. They don't make you sit there and digest your food so you can eat less. They just let you order how ever much you want, and clear plates quickly. And as soon as your table is starting to get bare, they come and take another order.  Are there more authentic and higher quality places in town? Sure. But for the price, this is probably as good as you are going to get.",

    "text": "What a great little place!   They offer a 2-for-1 drink specials all day everyday with All-You-Can-Eat for Lunch and Dinner 7 Days a week, including an appetizer and dessert item!   There are literally over 100 rolls to choose from, categorized by style (Baked, Tempura, etc.) Be careful though, anything you don't eat (unless you don't like it) they'll charge you for individually. I suggest (as do they) ordering little-by-little and opting for half rolls, when you can. This is to prevent people from ordering extra rolls \"to-go.\"  My friend and I sat down about 2pm on a Saturday and the place was occupied but not packed full. Our waitress was also very patient as we perused the menu over and over each time to decide what we wanted. Running staff was attentive at refilling our water glasses regularly but the one odd thing was our soy sauce bottle was replaced...three times. THREE! The first bottle was half empty, the second 3/4 full and the 3rd completed filled. It wasn't obtrusive to our meal, just comical.   Even without the All You Can Eat, the prices were incredibly reasonable. It's not much for ambiance, but it looked beautiful and tasted great!",

The waitress we had was not all joyful and friendly, but she did her job.  The music was cool at times but then they we're playing rap with the explicit lyrics. Literally the most explicit things were being clearly rapped....sexually explicit and vulgar. I was like wow does the manager even know what is being played? Most if not all of the employees were in early 20s so maybe they didn't care if the music had offensive language. So yes food is pretty good, and I'd say it's worth a visit. But if our waitress was more friendly...and the music not vulgar then I would have probably given it 2 more stars.",

We figure it was a honest mistake bc they can get busy.  Ingrid was taking orders at another table and checked up on us and saw there was a roll.  She came over, picked up that plate and said, \"That should be a hand roll.\"  With out skipping a beat she brought me over a hand roll without me pointing it out.

PROS *Food came out quick *Staff is very friendly  *They had this Channel sushi roll and OMG that's the reason why I gave them 3 stars vs 2. You have to try it. It's yummy. *Good amount of sitting areas.  *Buy one get one free drinks (THE BEST)  CONS *It's not located in the best part of Las Vegas. Hidden in the back of the Target shopping center.  *Restroom was very dirty  *Small waiting are \"Good luck in thinking you'll be sitting while your waiting for your table\" *The main reason for only 3 stars is because, it was super HOT in here. Just think, in Las Vegas during the summer and its 100+ outside and all they have are fans in the restaurant \"yup that's not going to cut it\" It was hard to enjoy your food when your sweating dripping water.      My favorite sushi place is \"Sushi Kaya\"",

It's True about the smaller-serving rice, which is why Sakana is so successful. People keep coming back for more! This was our first visit but definitely not our last.  Hubby ordered the AYCE and I, not being able to eat as much, ordered a la carte. I chose the Vegas 5-pc which consists of salmon, crab, fresh water eel, cream cheese, avocado, scallion, and eel sauce. It was deep fried and yummy beyond words!  I also had the Towering Sashimi Poki (4-pc) which is assorted fish, crab on wonton with ponzu, spicy mayo and eel sauce. OHMYGOD that was good too!  For the AYCE, basically you can get everything on the menu with small exceptions which the waiter will tell you. Other than that, you can choose what peaks your interest. The only thing is, you have to eat everything you order. No left-overs allowed and you can't take it home with you. If you have any leftovers, you will be charged for them.",

    "text": "I  came here with one of my friend since we both were craving for All you can eat sushi. We both have never tried this place since it not far from where we lived. When I got there the place was all ready full. Luckily my friend arrived before me and got us a table. He was already eating before me since he was very hungry. My friend started off with the appetizers which was very good. The service was great and they were very fast at cleaning off the tables. I ordered a Spider Roll which was very good. I like this Nigeri menu since it only comes in two rolls instead of eight or six. I was able to finish my rolls and eat a lot at the same time. I also ordered the Dynamite it was okay but my friend thought I was salty. My friend enjoyed the rolls that he ordered. The dessert were kind of disappointing for us. My friend ordered the black manager he tasted it was a weird taste at first but it got better. I ordered the mini toast with honey and the toast I felt like taste a Hawaiian rolll that you get at a store but drizzled with honey and ice cream at the top but overall it still good. I would come back here again for the price 25.95 for All You Can Eat Sushi most other sushi place i been too there usually 26 or 27 depends on where you go.",

    "text": "My cousin, her boyfriend, and my daughter ate here yesterday & it was our first time here. Decided to stop by since I was reading the amazing reviews on here! The ambiance is definitely different than all of the other sushi places we frequent. We ordered a lot of food, and majority of which were delicious! For $20.95 for AYCE lunch ($11.95 for kids), we thought it was a very good price to pay.  |Appetizers| - Bulgogi nacho (3.5/5): Tons of cheese, mayo, and beef. It was pretty good IMO, it's not something I would order again though since it was too sweet for my liking. My daughter obviously loved the mix of cheese, meat, and chips in one bite.  - Spicy garlic edamame (4/5): Second favorite spicy garlic edamame that I've tasted. They had enough spices in there. My number one favorite is at Sushi Bomb! - Miso soup (4.8/5): I'm a big huge fan of miso soup, and it's something that you really can't screw up. My dad was a chef in Japan, and he makes miso soup a lot in our house. This came pretty close to it! It was also very warm when it arrived on my table (as it should!). - Shrimp tempura (3.5/5): Again, my dad was a chef in Japan, so he has perfected a lot of these Japanese dishes. The shrimp tempura was alright. It was a bit soggy and fell apart when it was served to us. I get it. This isn't an authentic Japanese restaurant (it's Korean run), but if my dad, who's Filipino, can cook this to perfection the Japanese way, then so can they. - Dragon Ball (3.5/5): This was definitely something else. I believe it's deep friend mushroom with lobster mix stuffing. It was good, but it lacked something. It kind of tasted a bit bland for my liking. - Baked Green Mussel (5/5): Something that you absolutely cannot screw up! This was very delicious! Probably the best baked green mussel that I've ever had. They put sriracha sauce on top which gave it a nice kick.  |Nigiri| (5/5) - We ordered a variety of nigiri, but I wanted to rate the overall presentation, freshness, and taste to it. The fish-to-rice ratio on this is amazeballs! The fish meat is very thick, very fresh, and very delicious! They don't put too much rice with it which is a very BIG A+ for me! This contributed to adding one star to my overall experience.  |Rolls| (4/5) - Wet Dream: Perfect amount of flavor. The cream cheese wasn't too powerful. - Japanese Lasagna: ^ Same as the Wet Dream. The cream cheese wasn't overpowering the other tastes in the roll. - Chanel: This was alright. It was spicy, and I didn't like the fusion of the fish and spices.  |Service| (0/5) This is why they only get 2 out of 5 stars in this review. The service when I was there really was lacking. You'd think that it would spectacular since there were a lot of servers there, but it wasn't. I legit didn't tip much because of how poor it was. Their reasoning was their computer was having technical difficulties. Uh... We were doing AYCE! There were also 6 other servers running around the establishment giving the customers their orders and taking the orders as well. They completely ignored us. They only came to refill our drinks and take away the plates, but they didn't ask us if we wanted more. They just walked by us and took everyone else's order around us. It was really sad, pathetic, and I left VERY furious and angry.   Would I come back? Maybe. I'll give them another chance to redeem themselves in the far, far future. My husband wants to try this place out, so we'll see. Look for my future re-review of this restaurant. Hopefully, they get their act together and learn better customer service.",

WOW, I love the decorations they have even in the bathrooms (hello kitty themed). The environment is cute/comfortable :) . The service there is also very great keep in mind we been there multiple times, they take care of you quick & bring your orders very fast. My bf & I started going there when it first opened, now we noticed it's getting more known and a bit more busy which is good for them but then not so good for us because we sometimes have to wait a bit longer to be seated but nothing crazy. Honestly tho THIS PLACE IS WORTH IT ! The quality of their sushi is AMAZING !!! So delicious & since we discovered this gem we have not looked for another sushi place as we feel this is the best one so far ! I love it here so much, try it out you won't regret it. NO NAME IS THE BEST ONE & ITS SO PRETTY TOO (:  Ohhh they also have K-Pop music videos playing , I loveeeeeeeeee it, great atmosphere :)",

Service was five star- servers were friendly and helpful, brought us out delicious chef's specials and came just often enough for us to finish our orders before ordering more. Sushi was quality- nigiri was soft and fresh, and all rolls that were cooked were to perfection. Our favorites were the Lobster Roll and Monkey Brain, but all we ordered were spectacular. Something Wrong was amazing.  Atmosphere is warm and cozy. K-pop music playing on TV. We came a little later in the evening so it wasn't very busy and we were able to sit wherever we wanted.

When I inquired with the lady at the front counter she said she was waiting on a bar seat for me.  This is great but why would she not have let me know.  Furthermore, the bar seats are all parties of two as well.  So what is the point?",

The fish is high quality and fresh, and the rice is cooked well, not too hard like other sushi places.   I try to not get rolls when eating AYCE, but their lemon salmon roll was worth it. Some of my favorites of the nigiri are super white tuna, ama ebi, and yuzu yellowtail.   The desserts are also delicious. I love the affogato because its a nice way to end your meal with a mix of hot and cold. The service is quick, and the decor is pretty authentic, especially the wooden booths.

They have a huge menu of rolls and appetizers. I really liked the green tea panna cotta but it was in a super tiny dish, like 4 of them would equal to a normal portion, but it was so good!  We spent about $80 for 2 people but had about 3 beers/sake each. Will be back!",

If you can eat a lot of rolls and Nigiri then it would be worth it. Their yakitori was okay but it's decent for AYCE place. I highly recommend to get their Uni and Salmon Belly. Some items you can only order one time, so make sure you get each of those items .  We'll probably will come back.",

My friends and I definitely took advantage of the AYCE and everything came in a timely manner.  I took advantage of all the nigiri and appetizers since I was scared I would get full off of the rolls. Turns out you can also order half orders! Everything was super fresh and they also have UNI! Their menu has a wide selection and it definitely bums me out that I couldn't go a second time before I left.   Will definitely be back!   By the way, I definitely ordered way more than what is pictured below. I was just too hungry to take pictures of everything :)",

When you check in, you sign a paper with your name and how many people then they call you when it's ready, if you're not in the restaurant then tough luck because they just cross your name off after calling it once or twice. (Didn't happen to me, but to other people) my server was really rude and had a thick accent that I couldn't understand him. The menu was confusing because it was all you can eat but had the prices next to them, so we asked the waiter what that meant. After attempting to explain what it was very fast with a thick accent, I had to ask him to repeat it another 2 times because it's so loud in there as well. It's so hard to hear or understand what he was trying to say when 1. It's loud 2. He has a thick accent 3. He's talking way too fast. And he ended up getting mad because we couldn't understand what he was saying. To be honest, I wouldn't have left a tip for the service. Probably the worst service I've ever had. He only visited our table once and it was so hard getting his attention to get the bill. Yeah the food is good for being AYCE, but will not be coming back because the service is shit. Sorry not sorry.",

Salmon, albacore and yellowtail. All three were very fresh. The cuts of fish large with very little rice. I haven't seen such great fish to rice ratio even at non ayce. What a treat to not be filled by rice but wonderful fresh, well prepared nigiri. I filled up mainly on nigiri but also standard rolls like rainbow and caterpillar. They have chicken dishes, shrimp tempura and just a ton of other things. Check out the menu photos. The price was $20.95 per person. You can't beat this place. I was in sushi heaven. When you see the photos of rectangular plates loaded with nigiri, well that is exactly what you get. You'd think it would take a long time for them to make all this but it was just the opposite. Oh yeah, one more thing....the rice was done well. Held together nicely. Not falling apart. If you're a sushi addict like me don't pass this place up.",

    "text": "This place is phenomenal! I've tried 4 AYCE sushi places in Henderson/Las Vegas area and this is my favorite so far.  It's $25.95 for AYCE dinner price. ($20.95 for lunch)  They have a wide array of rolls available in addition to a huge appetizer and dessert menu. ***ORDER HALF ROLLS on rolls. That way you can try more things! The nigiri was on point. The amount of fish meat is enormous. The rice is standard size. I felt like the quality of the fish was excellent as well. They have basic nigiri as well as nigiri with sauces such as ponzu or their 300 sauce.  They have a section just for spicy rolls too.  ---Appetizers:  -Bulgogi (really saucy, really tasty. Get some rice, OR save your rice from the nigiri to eat with this) small bowl -The shit (this is really hit or miss for some people. IT's a deep fried spicy imitation crab roll that comes with sauce. I wanted more crunch so I didn't like it, but my friend LOVED it) 4 pieces -Baked mussels: It comes with 3 pieces and is not as covered in creamy sauces. So I actually enjoyed this more than usual because it wasn't as heavy.  ---Nigiri:  red snapper, super white tuna, salmon, *ocean trout*, salmon belly (dinner only), and yuzu yellow tail (I thought all the nigiri was good basically :P ) ---Rolls: (try ordering half rolls whenever you can!) -I love my ass: Yes this is the name of the roll. It's delicious. :)  -What the Heck Roll: This was SUPERB. I love soft shell crab, so I tried this instead of the generic spider roll. Loved it! Wish i couldve ate more.  -Towering sashimi poki: dinner only, not a roll. It is a wonton cracker topped with sashimi :) No rice!  -Rolls that didn't stand out: Chanel Roll, Hawaiian Roll, A roll with lemon on top (lemon salmon roll?) I didn't like whatever it was. haha.  ---Hand Roll: *MUST TRY** (crunch = tempura bits) -No Name Hand Roll: shrimp tempura, eel, salmon, and crunch with soy wrap. This tastes so good! I had a bite of my boyfriends and immediately ordered it even though I was full. Eel does have some tiny bones sometimes so not safe for kids. (Comes as a regular roll as well) -The Hulk: salmon, avocado, shrimp tempura with a dipping sauce. Excellent, but I dont wanna dip things.  ---DESSERT: Regular green tea & red bean ice cream are AYCE. Both are creamy and sweet, which is not the way i prefer EITHER options.  On top of that you can select one free dessert. They have a green tea custard, sesame dessert, vanilla tempura ice cream (my usual go to), and HONEY TOAST. The honey toast is on point, so I highly recommend. I did not get to try the green tea custard or sesame dessert but I heard from my bf that green tea custard was great.  Totally would come back. It's out of the way, but anyone craving sushi, i'm taking you here (iffff they have a big appetite) :P",

Highlights include the spicy garlic edamame, garlic tuna, white tuna, ama ebi, and salmon ebi. Definitely recommend prioritizing sushi over other items (like rolls). The pieces of fish on the sushi were huge, maybe a 2:1 ratio with size of fish vs. rice, which is pretty unheard of in most AYCE sushi places.  Such a good experience! I don't have much to say because everything was pretty great. People are in and out pretty quickly--we only waited ~20 mins on a Saturday night. Highly recommend!!",

I've been to this place 3 times already and each time I just wanna eat more and more (if that is even humanly possible) haha  Ok so I love the fact that they give you the sushi paper so you can take the time you want to really chose what you want.  So the servers don't have to hover over you and you are ummming and uhhhing trying to figure out which crazy sushi roll you want.   They do take appetizers orders by hand and dessert.    Appetizers I love to order: Chicken karage The yellowtail or salmon Kama Dynamite  Beef Fried rice Pork belly Mini udon  Calamari tempura Shrimp tempura Mussels   Rolls I usually get (I like simple flavors) (sorry for the boring list): Alaska roll Rainbow roll Dancing with eel roll   Desserts I enjoy:  Red bean ice cream  Affagato  I just have to say their salmon belly that they serve during dinner time is awesommmmmmme!  It just melts in your mouth.  We really enjoy the fish quality here, it is better than average buffets.  A couple notches below omasake places... oh man, that salmon.  This review is making me want to go back already!  They also don't stuff your face with the rice so that is awesome.  Just keep in mind to not over order!  They will charge you $5 if you leave too much food behind.  You can also order half rolls if you just want to try some rolls out.    Also the secret to the desserts is that you can get unlimited ice cream but only 1 of the other things like mochi, panna cotta and stuff.  I like affagatos so that's what I had each time.   I will def be back for more salmon belly.",

On all prior visits, after eating our sushi and appetizers we enjoyed 2 scoops of ice cream and a mini honey toast. When I asked for another scoop she said in a very rude tone \"No I already gave you a mini toast and \"one scoop\" of ice cream you are only allowed to have one dessert.\" So if you are familiar with their menu, you will see it says only one dessert of the more costly items like the honey toast, ect, ect below that statement. Be careful when eating at this restaurant, they seem to try a minimize the amount you are able to order by just dropping off the food items and quickly walking away. Rarely asking if everything is ok and if you want to order anything else. :-(",

Arrive around 7pm, the line was out of door and looking at 1:30 wait!  We return the next day for lunch early at 11:30am and was able to get in without waiting.  Damn, I was stuff with good sushi !! They are fresh and lot of none raw to choice from too as we have kids that doesn't eat raw just yet. Not to mention the price. Highly recommend if you looking for good quality sushi but be ready for a wait for dinner.",

Some Korean dishes like bulgogi, Jap chae.  Uni, oysters, ama ebi, some higher end stuff you don't commonly see.  Food is fresh, made it past 8 hours without anyone getting sick.  Has dessert including tempura ice cream, mochi, and other selections.    Minor downsides  Smaller place so can get crowded Cleanliness is about 3/5 Service while friendly is a hit or miss Sauces on a lot nigiri is unusual.  Maybe to hide when freshness is not the best?   18% tip for 6 or more people. Kids $14.95  Will definitely be back!",

Food comes out quickly and on time, but it's the waiting game for you to get your server to notice you is the problem I've noticed.   Everything is still solid good, fish to rice ratio is still on point. But service has changed. Shouldn't have to be struggling trying to get your server's attention.   They do have a limited time yelp special where once you rate and review them you get a free drink: choice of small Sapporo or small cold sake or soft drink.   Good opportunity for them to tighten up on the ordering service part. Food comes out quick but it's waiting on ordering it is the part that's slacking and even refilling drinks.   Time to retighten up. Oooh and please make sure my food is ALL GONE before you try to take my plate away please ;) and thank you.",

Unfortunately, this restaurant is in it to take as much money from you as they can and don't care at all about customer service or their reputation.  There are so many other options in the area, choose one of them. Last time I was in, our waiter let me start with a la carte and then switch to all you can eat later on.  Today when I asked to do this, our waitress very rudely told me that wasn't allowed.  I would completely understand if I wanted to try all you can eat and then drop down to a la carte but with this, you're getting roughly $20 out of me anyway.  This woman was incredibly rude and condescending the entire time we were there. They were also incredibly slow.  It was Saturday afternoon around 3PM and rather empty.  My friends and I all ordered at the same time, they got their food in about 5-7 minutes but they were ready for their second roll by the time I ever got my food.  After this, we waited about 15 minutes with empty plates before she ever even looked our direction. My rolls were so sloppy I could barely pick them up.  I got a piece of one of my rolls that was literally avocado wrapped in rice and nori.  One of my friends and I each ordered half-orders of different rolls and they put them on the same plate as if it was the same roll. Sakana was so great last time we went that I was so excited to go today; major letdown, unfortunately.",

We clearly were waiting and with a 90 minute time limit, that's ridiculous. On top of that, after we got our first 4 rolls, waiting for a few more, it's been at least 15 mins wait time to 30 mins in between. It's at the point where we're waiting with nothing to eat ALL WHILE HAVING A 90 MINUTE TIME LIMIT. What's worse is that the wait staff is also a tad bit rude. We asked to keep one of the menus and we were told in a really rude manner \"you have a bunch there\". What's more is that even the communication in terms of our orders was so bad. We were told that our nigiris were all going to be on one plate so we asked \"who else wants some?\" To make sure we know and the guy said \"no no stop. I will ask. I will ask the orders.\" What? Let us ask around so we're also aware who ordered. Now here we are, an hour into our meal with what? 30 minutes left and still waiting.",

My boyfriend told the server \"I just choked on a long piece of hair, and i'm still hungry.\" So the server said sorry, sorry and took off only one meal. So my boyfriend called the server over to tell him \"Why are we getting charged? We haven't been here  more than 15 min and my friend is still hungry!\" and so the server apologized and took it off.   This is our go to sushi spot for 2+ years.

The fish was fresh and the portions were generous.  They didn't give you tiny pieces of fish with a huge serving of rice like some AYCE sushi in vegas with similar price range.

Most of the food was gross or sweeten up and  anything that was good, you could only order once during the whole meal.   I do not know why no one mention this on their reviews: ANYTHING GOOD ON THE MENU CAN ONLY BE ORDERED ONCE!!! some examples of a one time order: towering sashimi poke, salmon belly nigiri, ami ebi (which is plain and does not look anything pictured on Yelp), oyster shoot, and so much more, but those are a few I tried.  Their food recommendation was not good either, like \"the shit\", which is really a piece of shit ( at least that appetizer was correctly named). I felt a little sick while eating there and couldn't even push myself to get desert, I just wanted to leave. I really wanted to like this place.  I wished I had gone to Yama instead, which is where I always go to when I am in Vegas. Their food is always good and you won't have to worry about being limited to one order of something good.",

It blows Umiya out of the water. The tempura was absolutely perfect, the service was great, and the price was the same! So worth it!!! HIGHLY suggest getting \"The Shit\", and the Pang(lobster roll with mayo and melted cheese and crab on top of a GARLIC ROLL). OMG it was so good. Ocean Trout is another must try, melts in your mouth. I laughed at each thing that said \"MUST TRY\" next to it on the menu, but they aren't lying. I cannot WAIT to come back!!!!",

    "text": "This is not a review for the AYCE option. If I had opted for the AYCE, the rating would perhaps be higher since quantity often trumps quality in that case. But in ordering regular rolls at list price, Sakana was just not worth it.   The interior is pretty typical of a Japanese restaurant, although I did notice that the freestanding tables towards the middle were interestingly arranged in diamond formation rather than square. Service was fine and tea refills were plentiful, although my waiter failed to inquire whether my table was ordering off the menu or doing AYCE. He just assumed we were doing the AYCE option even though we only ordered three rolls.   Bam Bam roll: The fish was mushy on top, the fish was even mushier inside, and the ingredients were unevenly distributed throughout the roll. I appreciated that this roll wasn't made with a plethora of rice just as filler, but the paper-thin pieces of fish were almost tasteless.   Lemon salmon roll: Again nice ratio of other ingredients to rice, but the imitation crab inside was so saturated with mayonnaise that I had a hard time tasting anything else. The salmon slices on top were a little more generous on this roll, but the lemon wedges were unevenly cut and placed. That may be fine for AYCE, but paying $10+ for that lack of attention to detail was disappointing. The roll was also served as pictured -- with one piece lying flat. This is because that piece was so large and irregularly sliced that it couldn't stand up, and the other pieces were variably cut into larger and smaller pieces as well.  Popcorn lobster roll: This was the worst of the meal, and that's actually saying something. The \"lobster\" balls on top were of some minced seafood variety, but I honestly couldn't taste any seafood flavor. They were also overly breaded and bordered on being over-fried, and the goopy sauce on top did nothing to alleviate their lack of flavor. The sushi pieces on the bottom were again sloppily made and cut into all different sizes, which made the whole dish even more unappetizing. I wouldn't recommend this, even as an AYCE option.  I'm so confused by the high ratings here. Perhaps I came on an off day or perhaps the endless nigiris ordered during AYCE could offset subpar sushi skills and unappetizing ingredients.. but I probably won't be back to find out.",

The food is either too sweet or too salty. And for $25.99, no sashimi. Most of the options are stuffed with lots of rice. I guess that's the strategy to fill you up quickly so you can't eat a lot.",

I've been to plenty of sushi spots in Vegas and this one has such high quality fish I have not found anywhere else in the city. The only downside to this location is the service. It always seems to lack when it gets busy. This location is definitely in need of more staff. Otherwise the food is AMAZING. Some star menu items I would recommend trying are the Hamachi Kama, Saba Misoyaki, Yuzu Yellowtail, Garlic Tuna, A Little Tease Roll, Hawaiian Roll, and Baked Lobster Roll.",

The entire menu is 25.95 for all you can eat (minus drinks) but everything else included which if you can put down the sushi is a great deal! My husband and I did not do the all you can eat but shared 4 rolls and we came in a $44, so depending on how much you eat may or may not be worth it.  The sushi itself was amazing, probably some of the best sushi I have ever had! I wish I could have tried more rolls but we were stuffed. The rolls came out really fast too, like within 10 minutes of ordering. If you're a sushi person, definitely suggest going there. It's off the strip but from the Mirage it was not even a 10 minute drive.  The services wasn't the best but the food made up for it! Would absolutely go back!",

During the check out, I asked the waitress what's the policy of the kid price. She told me that under 3 is free. So I told her that my son is not 3 years old. And then she said under 3 is free, but I have to order at least one item for him, which I never heard before, so I asked her to double check with the manager.  When the manager came, he told me that we have to pay for every kid. So I told him that the waitress just told me that under 3 is free, and I need to order at least one item for the kid. He said the store policy is every kid has to be pay as long as they can eat the food. We end up paying the half price for the 2 years old. The thing pissed me off is at least one of the waitress or the manager is lying about the kid price, because  what they said are totally different. I understand the price is calculated when we asked about the kid price, but I don't like the way they make up the story just to cover the charge. Moreover, they also have a 90 minutes limit to eat. When the time is almost up, the manager told us he will give us 15-20 minutes to eat but there is a lot of people waiting. I checked out the window, there is NO ONE standing outside.  I really suggest the business owner should reconsider the management. Allowing such an unethical person to be the manager will just keep the customers away. No matter what, I will never visit the store again.",

First off, I showed up a little after 8pm, there was 6 in my party, and they offered me a table for 4. Uhh no, we're not trying to squeeze into a tiny booth. Mind you, there was no wait when I showed up but several parties that arrived after managed to get tables before us. Yes, I understand I had a large party but l, let's be honest, it still sucked.   As for the food, I'm no professional as to how it should be prepared but some sushi pieces that arrived were noticeably warmer than they should've been.  Let's talk about service. I've been coming here since before I was pregnant with my oldest child. She is a little over 3 now. I don't know if you have any kids but I know for a fact that my toddler does not consume the same amount of food as would a 5 or 10 year old would. So when I tell you I was a little mad that the server  told me i needed to pay for all you can eat for my kid, I was pretty upset. She ate a couple pieces of shrimp tempura and the server was all over it. I informed her she could charge her a la carte for the shrimp tempura but that was the tipping point.   When we first started coming here, there was a tiny Asian lady that managed the restaurant. She was delightful but the staff they have now is horrible. I'll be taking my business elsewhere",

Normal sales tax is 8.25% and the receipt even said 8.25%, but the total tax for sure wasn't 8.25% of my total. Not sure if this was an honest mistake or if they hope nobody will notice. I urge everyone to make sure the sales tax is correct before you pay. They did refund me my money for the difference. I know it's not a lot ($4.50 or something like that), it's the fact that it seems very sketchy to me which made me retract a star",

    "text": "This is my favorite ayce sushi place. Too bad I live in SoCal and am only in Vegas once or twice a year.    CONS: My only real complaint is the method of ordering. I'm accustom to ayce sushi places that have you mark down on a piece of paper what you want to order. This place makes you order with the server which doesn't seem bad but because it's an ayce sushi place, I like to order a bunch of things at once and plan out my meal. With such a big menu, it's time consuming and inefficient to sit there with the server and go through the menu one item at a time and pick out what I want now and what I want later in my meal.   PROS: Okay, enough negative talk. Let me tell you why I love this place. First of all, the food is great. I love their attention to detail. Most ayce sushi places serve fish in bulk so they throw fish on rice and push it out as fast as they can. Not at Sakana. All fish looked beautifully cut. And for some, they add garnishes that complement the fish (it doesn't mask the flavor of the fish either). I ordered the baked mussels and noticed they shuck the meat off the shell before baking. This allows you to slurp it right off the shell instead of having to pull the meat off yourself. I also noticed good cuts on fish and garnishes. Little things like these separate this place from other ayce sushi places. They're definitely not lazy here. They don't cut corners. They go the extra mile to make sure the dining experience is enjoyable in every way. Even the wait staff was on it. My water was always full. Even when I poured my entire glass into my hydroflask, they were right there with a refill. I'm excited to come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. It's literally the one thing I look forward to the most right now. Follow up review coming once that happens.",

    "text": "We came here because my GF read good yelp reviews about it. The STAFF service was EXCELLENT!!! My 2 stars is because the quality of the fish in the Sushi nigiri was just NOT GOOD. There are simply better for the same price range in this area. I wouldn't had came here if the GF didn't insist, especially after we just had one of my best ayce sushi in VEGAS at YAMA SUSHI last night, where the fish was so damn fresh and most importantly the rice in the nigiri wasn't the size of a chicken nugget. Yes.. that's another issue I have with this joint. The rice is HUGE, soft and wet, which some people may really enjoy but not me... The dessert selection is great which is different from other places.",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant in Vegas, hands down. AYCE that is fresh, tasty, affordable, and sushi with so much more fish than rice. The sushi rolls are good, but what keeps us coming back is the delicious nigiri, appetizers, and low carb options (bottom right on the menu). The Towering Sashimi Poke is basically a delicious fish/sauce topped nacho. One of the best things I have ever eaten... Absolutely divine. Anything with scallops like the dynamite appetizer and baked scallop roll is amazing. The chicken yakitori is gourmet status- so good. I've been a regular for a long time and am so sad I had to move back to LA. To be honest, this place makes all other sushi in Los Angeles or Las Vegas look sub par. An absolute gem. I miss you, Sakana!!!",

    "text": "The first time my best friend and I visited this place, it was outrageously good. The overall quality of the fish, and the rice to fish ratio on the nigiri was on point. We have gone back more than three times now together, and individually with other friends, and it has dramatically declined in quality, not just in food, but service. The owners are quite nice from what we have experienced, but the servers here always always always forget one or two... or three things we order.   I decided to take a few coworkers here after work the other day because they were craving sushi after our long day, and after that last experience, I know personally I would never be back. Not only did they forget three of the things we ordered at our table, but they sent us two rolls we never even ordered. The quality of the fish was variable and we could tell that the yellowtail was not fresh because of its distinct smell and taste. So disappointing that their miso soups came out late and at room temperature at best without tofu. Some of the baked rolls that we ordered came out with a huge amount of mayo that overpowered the taste of the content. One of the rolls, the dragon, came out with brown avocado slices... Completely lost my appetite after eating some of the yellowtail nigiri and seeing that... This place has definitely gained some mad popularity from the first time we visited, so maybe they just don't care for quality like they used to? but, my advice... they are not consistent with the quality of the fish, the service is friendly, but extremely slow and forgetful, and overall, for what you pay, this is one AYCE sushi place i will never come bring people back to, recommend, or visit in vegas.",

The garlic edamame is pretty good if you wanna try something different. The shrimp tempura is freshly cooked so there were plenty of those orders coming our way. The baked scallop roll with cream cheese is my favorite (the baked lobster roll with cream cheese comes close, which is pictured below) but in honesty, all the rolls here you can't do wrong with. The service was good and the food comes out pretty quick. The place gets busy so expect a wait if it's the weekend. We came in on a Monday around lunch so there wasn't a wait time and were seated right away. Keep in mind that you can only make reservations for parties of 10+. Other than that, if you're looking for good AYCE sushi, Sakana is a must try! Made the mistake of going to the AYCE across the street from here and it was mediocre, maybe even lower. I wouldn't suggest going there. All in all, best sushi here in Vegas!",

Service was good, drinks were never empty. Sushi came out quickly, which I can't complain about. Good was very tasty, like everyone else has mentioned the rice to fish ratio 1:1. One thing I do notice about good sushi is that the rice is compacted enough where it it stays together from the pick up to the dipping of soy, be soft enough when it hits your mouth the rice will fall apart on its own without the first chew. I know it sounds weird but it's True. Lastly, just to mention the black sesame panna cotta desert was perfect, not too sweet but still tastes the roasted seeds was excellent. The boyfriend says it tasted like a \"rubber tire\" but he does not like the Asian deserts much so there you go.",

    "text": "AYCE dinner $22. Auto gratuity (for large party) plus tax... $30.  Yeah, the sushi is cheap...ER than other places but I'd rather pay more for better service and quality. My friends chose this place and after seeing all the wonderful pics on yelp, I was super excited to try it out. Boy, was I disappointed. None of the items we ordered looked like the pictures! Nigiri was aiiight. The slices of fish were pretty and long... but so thin, and so much rice! Rolls were decent. I didn't try too many so no real opinion on those.  Service was not impressive at all. We had a large party... 10 people. But we called and made a reservation the day before. They should have been prepared. It was dinner time and sorta busy but still only had 2 servers/waiters. People that got there after us somehow managed to order and get their food before us. And our table was right in the middle of the place! They weren't ignoring us... just not very observant. Anywho, we were finally able to flag them down for orders but instead of taking orders normally, they handed us a sheet of paper with their menu items and had us mark which ones we wanted. I wasn't a fan of this but it made it easier for them. There were a couple things that I had to hand write out on the side because they didn't have it on the list.. NBD. The first couple appetizers came out but we still didn't have dipping or eating plates! We had to bug them to bring it out. The reason I was annoyed of the service was because they were hard to get a hold of. Each time they brought a new item out, they'd hand it to us (literally... hand the plate to us, instead of placing it on the table), and have us figure out the organizing. There was a handful of times where we had empty plates to be cleared but they just walked away.   Also.... I'm not normally a huge germaphobe but there were fruit flies all over! We kept waving our hands around the entire time to shoo them away. They were even in the restroom.  I will most likely not ever come back here again.",

What I don't like of those places generally is that they steer you towards the rolls that contains a tiny bit of fish and lots of rice... If they offer Nigiri or Sashimi, they often limit you to a few pieces.  This isn't the case here. They might limit you to one or two order for a few delicacies but you can have Nigiri all you want... and it is mostly what I had. The food was good ans the service attentive. They are in fact very generous on the fish portion for the Nigiris. When I was there, they has a 2 for 1 on sake and beer also.  Atmosphere is fun, warm and welcoming.  All and all, propably now my favorite AYCE sushi in town.",

The vibe is homey and warm. Service super-fast, low-key, and menu knowledge is top notch. Dirty plates are taken away lickety-split. AYCE is the way to go. Two of us plowed through a dozen or more plates for around $60 with tip. Soda is in cans though so be forewarned.  Wonderful place I'd return to in a heartbeat, sushi curmudgeon or no.",

    "text": "May 27, 2016 @ 2 PM.    This is the second AYCE sushi joint we have visited in Vegas and this time we took my son.  We came here right after three hours at Bally's pool and we were starving.  It is about a 15 minute drive from the Strip.    The staff sat us immediately and were very patient explaining you can order anything on the menu (except for a few dinner items) for the AYCE lunch.  It costs $20.95 per person and lunch is served from 11:30 to 3 PM.  I will say, the slices of fish were thick and the fish to rice ratio was good, not great, but good.  The service was excellent.  As soon as the food or drink disappeared, a waiter was there to serve us more.  Just make sure you eat everything you order or they charge you more.  I am going to list some of the best items we tried.  Sushi: Yellowtail tuna, Smoked Paprika Salmon, Sarada Lobster, Salmon,  Wouldn't try again: Surf clam, Aomori scallop  Appetizers: The Shit, Pang, Fried pork belly (absolutely wonderful), Fried crab meat on skewer  Rolls: Popcorn Lobster Roll, TNT Roll, Wet Dream, Philadelphia Wouldn't try again: Call 911 Roll (I like spicy, and they warned me, but this one is just too hot to enjoy.  Be warned, it has Jalapeno AND Habanero)  Want to try when we return: Monkey Brains, Lobster King Roll, Playboy, I Love My Ass, Hulk Burrito  Make sure you get the 2 for 1 drink special (all day long) which allows you to buy one sake, beer, wine, or soju and get one free.    Altogether, for three of us, we paid $80, and were barely able to walk out.  In fact, had to take a nap in the car in the parking lot we were so sleepy!",

The decor is really fun and I found the constant reminder to eat all of your food hilarious. I ordered heavily off of the nigiri menu and the fish servings were large and delicious.   Be aware that there are menu items that do not clearly describe all sauces and toppings used, which is a problem for those who are celiac or gluten free.   I would highly recommend speaking with your server about any hidden ponzu sauce or eel sauce (both made with regular soy sauce which has gluten). Otherwise, they have tamari and are very generous with their sauces.",

    "text": "First time coming here getting away from the usual buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. I've been to other buffets there but first time coming to Sakana for AYCE sushi! The price isn't too bad at about $25.95 per person. We came here on a Friday night and waited about 20-30 mins. Place is a bit small as there aren't really any big tables. They did combine tables for our party of 12 which is probably why we waited a bit longer as we had to wait for the other parties to finish up.  Good thing about this place is that not only was the sushi good, but also their service. Fast service and great service with help all the time from picking up your empty plates to refilling your drink. The food came quick. Out of all the sashimi and suhi/sushi rolls we ordered, the only thing that wasn't cooked right was the shrimp's head as they weren't really fresh. Besides that, I can't really complain much about this place. The end of the food craze is the dessert as there are plenty of options here but of course we had to get their green tea ice cream. I would definitely come back here for a AYCE sushi craving.",

Most of the time around 6 and after, the wait will be very long! BUT don't let that discourage you because once you get seated and try their sushi, it is definitely worth the wait since it's also AYCE. I like the nigiri sushi here compared to a few other sushi places here in Vegas! As for their rolls, I think I would say it is decent like any other place, but there are some other sushi restaurants that have better rolls in my opinion!   A few of my favorites:  Salmon  Salmon belly  Yuzu yellowtail  Eel  Oyster  White tuna",

    "text": "Tried this AYCE sushi place for lunch with my wife. Located in the Target shopping center on Maryland and Flamingo. It's at the end of the strip mall and still says Kabuki for the name.  AYCE lunch was only $20.95 which is pretty reasonable. They have quite a decent selection of appetizers, rolls, and nigiri. I especially like that they don't have a lot of stipulations such as time limit? (Not that i saw anyway), no limits on desserts or really much of anything. Pretty generous.  Rolls are good and put together well, with very fresh fish, not too much rice, and just enough sauce. Nigiri sushi was excellent. Nice big pieces of fish and just a little ball of sushi rice. Excellent quality and nice selection. Apps were decent and had some different offerings including bulgolgi nachos and something called \"the shit\". Not quite sure what it was but it looked like it's name. Lol. Some kind of tempura log.  Good dessert at the end with all the various ice creams.  Overall nice small restaurant. Quiet and clean. Excellent quality sushi served fast and with great customer service. Our waitresses were great very nice and hospitable and made sure we enjoyed our lunch. Great place for AYCE. Looking forward to try their dinner menu next.",

You don't even need to hit the casinos the next day!   My whole family was sick with food poisoning for 2 days.. our Christmas was ruined. Thanks so much!  Ps. If you actually read the reviews, Sakana has been solicitating 5 star reviews with free drinks. Health violations should be taken seriously and not be covered up with fake good reviews!!!!! Avoid at all costs!",

Of course, this would mean nothing if the fish quality wasn't also very good. I realized last night that it's the perfect ratio. I enjoy sashimi, but I couldn't do all-you-can-eat without requesting a bowl of rice. At Sakana, I felt like I was eating a long cut of sashimi with a little bit of rice attached for good measure.  There are a couple things Sakana does that are a little different. First, they serve uni in basic nigiri format as opposed to gunkanmaki (I found that on wiki); in other words, they don't wrap it in nori. That's not a bad thing. Second, rather than give you a whole salmon kama, they serve it up as bite size portions. Not necessarily a bad thing but worth noting.  AYCE sushi dinners are usually a blur. Rather than try to list everything I remember enjoying, I'll just refer you to Tony T's photos. And of course, I cannot forget about dessert. They have the staples like mochi and tempura ice cream, but I decided to get the less common Green Tea Panna Cotta and the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. Both were a great way to cap the dinner.",

They have excellent service to go with their quality fish and offer a good variety on their AYCE menu - which will only cost you around $20 for lunch and $22 for dinner.  Can't beat that!  THE MEAT:  We went in for lunch on a Wednesday and were 1 of the only 2 tables there.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and the food came out in good time and pace.  The soft shell crab was light and served with a tasty ponzu sauce.  \"The shit\" (crab and cooked salmon in nori, deep fried and served with yum yum sauce) didn't quite live up to its slang name (I wonder if they chose it for its aesthetic resemblance).  The salmon kama was presented beautifully (as all of their food are)... it is a piece not quite on the collar itself but still very tender.  The monkey brains will please any fusion fan, it surely teased my palette with familiar crab salad mixed with sweet banana tempura.  I wanted to hate it so bad, but got quite the opposite effect.    And the sushi, my oh my.  The fish to rice ratio is ridunculous!  We loved the salmon, hamachi, super white tuna... and the lasagna roll is good if you like cream cheese.  How they make profit for serving great quality with an extensive AYCE menu for so cheap in a low key neighborhood eludes me.  I do hope they can keep up the exceptional value for your money!  I would totally franchise this spot.  Binge on good sushi with flip flops here or hide in one of the dark corners with an ugly mistress.  GOGOGO!  (P.S. I recommend not bringing the kids unless it was for lunch, or if they are capable of behaving like... college students out for sushi and sake.)  I'M STILL DIGESTING... The Japanese pop music videos filled with scantily clad grown high school students.  Now there's a night's worth of conversation over sake.

Loved every bite...this was the highlight of the night for me!  It's not limited to 1pp either!!  Maybe I can just fill up on these next time, without them giving me the evil eye!  Nigiri : Garlic Tuna, Hamachi, Super White, Amaebi, Unagi, and Scallops were all great!  Lots of these have little additions to them, so be sure to specify if you want your fish \"naked\" or how chef prepares them!    Most of the nigiri had such a crazy fish/rice ratio, that you could wrap the fish all the way around the rice if you wanted to...end to end.  It's like AYCE sashimi with a touch of rice!  Since we came in a large group, I was able to try some of the rolls too...everything was pretty good!  They have lots of good appetizers as well, to stand out from the heavy competition in Vegas.  I am sure we will be back :)  Tons of pics! :",

    "text": "This place deserves an updated review after my 2nd visit. With finishing up my Goyemon stamp card, I now feel like I have the freedom to eat whatever sushi spot I please without having the feeling of \"oh that could have been another stamp to fill before my card expiration date\" feeling.   With that said, I think Sakana should take up punch cards! I mean don't get me wrong, Goyemon is great, but it's the power of the punch card and the idea that I could get a free meal soon that kept me tied to the place for so long. Oh and the fact that they basically set a deadline to receive your free meal.  I really enjoyed my 2nd visit to Sakana. I definitely saw lots of improvements in the menu, although they were minor, they still made a big impact. For example, the subtle garnishes they add on different nigiri. My absolute favorite is the super white tuna topped with sea salt and shredded nori. I couldn't believe the huge taste difference with such a small added detail. Also, the small pieces of ikura added on to salmon belly nigiri were on point! I received complimentary hamachi sashimi pieces from the chef. I was absolutely grateful for it, but the pieces were still a bit frozen and hard to chew through. That was sort of disappointing. However everything else definitely made up for it.   They now provide a menu sheet that you can mark on, which is great! I go a little crazy at sushi restaurants and it's hard to remember exactly what I want for the first order -- there's lots of fish names swimming around in my head. It really helps me and the server that I can just mark down what I want per order.   There were lots of presentation improvements too. I like that they added a leaf garnish (?) between the plate and your order. It makes for a great food photo op :) However, I feel like they still need to work on the interior design of the restaurant. They had scrolls of cloth sectioning off the tables that had messaging scribbled on with what looked like a crayon. It just doesn't represent the quality of their food well. I noticed behind the sushi chefs they had vertical rectangular sheets of paper hanging all over the walls that I would assume represents Japanese custom of a menu (like Ichiza). If they could set the ambiance and decor as a traditional chic sushi restaurant, this place would be perfection. Like if Kabuto and Ichiza had a restaurant baby, I would hope it would be what Sakana looked like.   But the important thing really is the food selection. Still a big fan of their large cut nigiri pieces! This place will definitely be my go-to spot for my next few sushi fixes.",

    "text": "I had bookmarked this place to try, and my sister actually got to go ahead of me.  We both liked this place a lot for their service, and we did like a few specific menu items to go for when in the mood. Honestly reminds me a bit of Yama though in regards to their types of special rolls.  The boyfriend and I had Kevin as our server and a few of the ladies there to help him during the weekend lunch stint. They were all nice and friendly, knowledgeable about their menu items too. It was cool to be able to just chat with the guy between ordering and eating our dishes. The bus person also made sure our glasses were always filled (came handy for the 911 special), and that our table was always clean of empty plates.  The atmosphere is more chill in comparison to its close competitor (always crowded), and the staff is definitely more involved with your experience so it's not like they just talk to you when they think you're ready to order. Decor is cute too. Let's see... They definitely have more menu items than I'm used to, and the servers would be glad to tell you if the items are specifically for dinner or limited. We definitely enjoyed The Shit (appetizer), 911 (even though it was crazy spicy!), Monster Roll, and their Japanese Lasagna.",

I was seated soon after I walked into the restaurant and my drink order was immediately taken.  Shortly after, I was asked if I was ready to order. I replied that I was waiting for my friend.  4 other people over the span of 30 minutes continued to ask if I was ready to order and each time I had to tell them I was waiting for my friend.  A bit of communication between staff would have been helpful here.  When we did order, I ordered as a la carte.  The sushi was really good! Being from Hawaii, I consider myself a sushi snob and am particular about where in Las Vegas I go to eat sushi.  I would come back here again!    The location is tucked away in the very end corner of the Target shopping center, behind the SAS shoe store.  To me, this makes it less accessible, which in turn means more empty tables!  Finally, I would like to note that we were charged for the all you can eat instead of a la carte.  Not cool in my book.  I am a fan, and will probably go back again.",

Their sushi has the biggest pieces of fish I've ever seen on sushi rolls. It also tasted very fresh. Some of the things i had that were amazing were as follows: Bonita Senorita roll, What The Heck roll, the green mussles, The Shit, Double Dragon roll, and my favorite was the garlic tuna. I had a bunch of other things that were good but not worth mentioning. Going back for sure",

A friend of my mine from Vegas recommended this place as we are looking for a sushi place.  So we headed to this place....We were the 1st in line when they opened at 11:30am so we were seated right away. We all went for the all you can sushi for $20 each which is not bad.  We ordered all kinds of sushi, nigiri, rolls, their specials, salmon collar, appetizers etc etc and I am telling you they were all delicious!!! we loved every single food they served on our table!  Their salmon and tuna nigiris are one of the best I've ever tasted.  The sushi rolls were amazingly good.  They are not good they were excellent. Appetizers especially the spicy edamami were exceptional.  The freshness of their fish is what got me.  This is the 2nd best sushi place I've ever been in my life so far.  Included in the $20 AYCE is the dessert.  We tried all of them and they were all good especially the fried banana and tempura ice cream.  Staff are nice and friendly and very fast service.  Very nice place and clean.  The only thing I didn't like is the 18% automatic service fee for 6 people and up.  Eventhough, If ever I'm going back to vegas, I will still come back to this place because we love sushi! 5 stars!",

With the recommendation from my dear friend, John L. - I had the privilege to try this spot with a group of my nursing school friends last Saturday! This place gets packed so be prepared to wait, especially around dinner time, especially on a weekend!  ALL YOU CAN EAT is basically everyyyyyyyyything in the menu except drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The menu has soooooo many options, it may be overwhelming, but pace yourself because they have so much to offer.   My absolute favorite item in the menu was the salmon nigiri - holy holy sh!t! This was sooooooooo buttery soft and full of fresh flavor - you have to try this! The green mussels were also to die for. For the spicy roll I opted for the A$$ spicy bla bla bla, personally it wasn't that spicy.   Here's the thing, I don't consider myself a \"sushi lover\" so when I say this place is good, it's GOOD. I'd hiiiiiiighly recommend it!",

It didn't taste good since it was drowned in sauce, so we didn't eat 80 percent of it. We explained this to the thin Japanese waitresses and she was offended and told us it was our fault for ordering the wrong item, then told us that we would be charged for wasting it even though we ate everything else.   Another waiter cleared our table then gave us the check, she didn't think we had ordered too much and didn't bill us for the roll. But then the thin waitress took the bill off our table, charged us for the roll, then gave me the bill back. What?!   Needless to say, the price of the roll was her tip $7 for a $40 bill. AYCE sounds like a good deal, but you might errantly get charged based on how the waiter is feeling. Cannot recommend this place.",

I actually had a lot of skin that I had to spit back out as it wasn't chewable.   The other thing that got me was the service was slacking. I can actually count how many times my server engaged the table.. it was 4. I had to wave others down for help or refills.   The food was good and I had a great time but I am still on the search to finding a new and favorite AYCE sushi spot. My favorite thing I did like was the mango sake, they have a strawberry one but I'll have to try it next time.",

    "text": "Checked out this spot on 3/6/19 Wednesday for dinner at around 830, there was about 4 to 5 parties ahead of me when I signed in. So I waited outside like the other parties that was waiting to be called and seated for their seats. So 10 mins passed by, then 20mins passed by. And I noticed other parties after me was being seated. So I walked in and check the sign in sheet, and I noticed my NAME was crossed out and I was like wth are we serious right now. I been outside the whole time and no staff came outside to even mention my name. (so WRONG) So I walked to one of the staff people and told them I been waiting outside and no one called my name and somebody just crossed out my name. So the staff person I talked to immediately looked for a table for my party and I (thank you for the quick response time). I had a party of 6 as well.   Aight let's talk Food * all I can say is their NIGIRI sushi here is on different level, speaking FISH CUT (bruhh) thumbs up straight up. We ordered a bunch of different nigiri's specially the ones that are LIMITED to just one order per person like  *Salmon Belly *Ocean trout  *AMA ebi(shrimp) *Uni also orders their OYSTERS which is one order per person kind of wish If was all you can eat oysters (Slurp slurp)   Also their HAND ROLLS were good we had their  *salmon skin  *soft sheer crab (Ohhh weeeee)   For desserts they had green tea ice cream / honey toast with ice  cream (Which is aight)  but I had their TEMPURA ICE CREAM WOWWZERS.   Parking * lots of parking stalls fronting the Resturant and it's free parking as well.   Would I want to come to this spot again * Defiantly Guarantee I would.   If I'd choose between this spot and gyoyemon I honestly would say SAKANA. IMO just better cut and quality of fish. But again everyone has their own TASTE BUDS.   A yo SAKANA can we please make AYCE on oysters please thanks .",

The sushi were all fresh and they put a LOT of fish and only a tiny ball of rice which we of course LOVED. The best one was the ocean trout! We also got a couple appetizer items that were marked as \"must try\". The one that was deep fried was very good! My favorite desserts were the green tea flan-type thing and the black sesame flan.

    "text": "I was asked by a family friend to give Sakana a try and to report back to him about how it was and was it worth it to go. Well all I can say is Sakana is okay or about 2.5 stars (I rounded down to 2). Definitely not the best All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) sushi place I've been too and there are better options around.  So I went with my girlfriend on a Friday night (7 PM) and the place wasn't hard to find. Parking was a bit crowded, but if you're willing to park farther back in the lot and take a short walk then you'll be fine. When we got there there was wait. This is a good sign since obviously Sakana is pretty popular. We put ourselves on the wait-list and proceeded to meander around outside. We waited about 45 minutes for about 15 other names to cycle through till it was finally our turn. Inside the place was packed (another good sign). All tables had customers chowing down and tables without people were being cleared in preparation for new customers.  The pricing for AYCE sushi at dinner time is about the same as you would see at other places (~$26). The menu had a wide selection of items and similar to other places there were a few premium items that you could only order once. The back of the laminated menu also had an assortment of rolls. However being AYCE sushi veterans my girl and I know not to order rolls and instead stick with the Nigiri. Rolls typically have more rice and they utilize less acceptable slices of the fish since it's hard to see in or around the rolls. Also most rolls are layered with a sauce that can mask lower quality or not as fresh fish. It's the same reason you don't order steak well done since the chef knows that the meat will be cooked all the way through they can just give you a mediocre slice of beef - you wouldn't be able to tell.  What we thought about the food: We ordered several items including most of the items you could only order 1-time and the server went on her way. Our first round of food came which was oysters and fried whole shrimp (ama ebi). They tasted fine, but the oysters were overly sauced. I would come to realize that ALOT of the nigiri we would receive would be covered in a sauce of some kind. I don't like this since the sauce masks the natural flavor and texture of the fish. It's kind of a cop out to allow a wider range of mediocre fish to be served.  The skewers (also only order 1-time) were ......meh. Anything you order that has bacon will taste like bacon. We had the lobster and bacon as well as the scallop and bacon and you know what they tasted like? Overly crisp bacon. You could've put in toenail clippings and all I would taste is bacon.  Most of the nigiri pieces that we received were already covered in a sauce of some kind. Many of the sauces were sweet which I do not like for my nigiri (see above about my rant regarding sauces). We also received some items we never ordered.  Some additional thoughts: Super white tuna - affected by sauce Uni - lower quality. How do I know? The uni was not a continuous piece but actually several smaller pieces i.e from bunch of sources. Sarada Lobster - Don't waste your time and stomach space with this. It tasted like your standard store bought imitation crab meat that's sweet. Hamachi (Yellowtail) Kama - The portion was small. Go to Goyemon or Yama sushi for a better experience. Towering Sashimi Poke (4pcs) - this looked better than it tastes and wasn't worth ordering since the mixture of fish was masked by the sweet/spicy sauce.  Ice Cream - Green tea and Red Bean both tasted very neutral? They were both sweet and cold, but the flavor of green tea or red bean wasn't very prominent.  What we thought about the service/experience: Our server was personable, but very slow. Either she or the back kitchen preparing our order did kind of a poor job. They got our orders wrong several times. Either we never got what we ordered, received the wrong quantity, received something we never ordered or we had to ask 2-3 times for something we already ordered. There was one item that never came out till AFTER the bill arrived and we were already eating dessert. It was something that we knew they had since we had ordered it before earlier and it wasn't restricted to 1-time. What da fah?  Why we won't go back: -Nigiri as well as most of the items on the menu are covered in sauce. If you like your sushi this way then you most likely don't really appreciate sushi/sashimi and just like things that are sweet. Yeah I went there! I'm calling you out if you must have your sushi sweet, order rolls with cottage cheese in them, or don't like wasabi because it's \"too spicy\". -Rice quantity to fish ratio is higher than at other places such as Goyemon. So you'll get full on less orders and most of the filling up will be done by rice. -Service was a bit slow which is forgivable on a busy night such as Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, but the staff needs to at least get the orders right. One mistake is fine, but 2-3 on the same table? That's pretty lame.",

I sat at the bar and the sushi chefs were legit. Really nice and fun. Sit there if you can. Also pro tip: you can order half rolls which I love since you can try more stuff. Their AYCE menu is huge. Lots of rolls have tempura shrimp which I love but some may not. Do yourself a favor and get the lobster king roll, dynamite, and nigiri. You will get the biggest pieces of your life. It's basically sashimi because they put the smallest dab of rice with a monster piece of fish on top. You can even get dessert. GET THE HONEY TOAST!!!!!!!!",

I really like the shrimp one (don't remember the name), all the nigiri was fresh. I would avoid the salmon lobster on bread, was too sweet for me and i had to finish it. Was a struggle. I went alone so there was not much of a wait. If you come with a group there might be a wait. Definitely worth it tho.",

Highly recommend nigiri over rolls, as they give huge portions of fish to rice ratio. And rolls we got just did not compare. Highly recommend the Uni and Salmon  belly. Best uni ever~  Quick service considering the time limit. Really cute decor and ambiance. Clean and cute bathrooms. All in all, one of the best sushi joints I've been to and beats out of any the Strip buffets.",

Sakana became one of our favorite AYCE sushi joints and I'll tell you why. For $25.95 for dinner, you can order everything on the menu. They have a huge selection of appetizers and nigiris. The fishes are fresh, tasty and of good quality. The best thing to order is the salmon belly, uni, ame, and oysters. Even though it's a limited order of one order per person, it's a must!! We tried almost everything on the menu and it was all delicious!!",

He was extremely rude and told me not To yell at him when I clearly was not. Other people in our party couldn't believe how rude he was to me!!!  I wasn't planning to tip but he added 20% tip to our bill. I will not go back to place based on the treatment from this waiter!!!!",

Compared to the other restaurant this place was crowded which seemed like a good sign. Then I tried the fish and they were good but not as good or impressive as the other place.  So feeling a bit dissappointed we tried lemon salmon roll and I was surprised.  This place had really good sauce.  That is probably why there were a lot more younger crowd. So.. if you like fish, and if you want an impressive fish for AYCE sushi go to other place.  If you like the rolls with impressive sauce for AYCE sushi (as you know most AYCE sushi place have only 2 types of sauce) then come here.",

    "text": "Hooooo boy did we get our money's worth tonight! By ordering the dinner only nigiri (ocean trout, salmon belly, oyster, uni, amaebi) alone, you already  easily surpass the $25.95pp AYCE price. I agree with other Yelpers in that even if you come for lunch, pay the extra $5 for the dinner only options!  Highlights: salmon belly (comes with a touch of wasabi that I thought was great), unagi, amaebi, scallop, and the free salmon sashimi thing we got in the beginning (from one of the chefs who thought my friend was cute heh).  I ordered a bunch of saucy nigiri as a lot of people seemed to like them (yuzu yellowtail, super white tuna w/S.O sauce, smoked paprika salmon w/yuzu). Personally didn't care for any of them..the sauces did not add much aside from an oily sheen to the fish?  Do NOT order the Saba misoyaki - lacking in miso taste and it was not deboned. I had to fish out bones from my mouth after every bite. And I know mackerel is an oily fish but this was excessively oily...I also gave their mushroom skewer a try and was equally disappointed. Literally 1 1/4 plain mushroom on a stick - shriveled and each quarter was the size of my thumb. Took note to avoid ordering any of their appetizers in future visits.  Service was friendly but kind of awkward. Our main server \"refilled\" my hardly touched water, we would get asked several times if everything was alright different people and when we told them we were just waiting on something, they seemed surprised. I really wish they would go with the system where you mark down what you want yourself rather than taking your order (we had to repeat our initial big order several times).  So why the 4 stars despite all my complaints? That fish to rice ratio!! You could literally wrap the fish around the entire rice ball and more. And for the most part, I enjoyed the nigiri I got. Worth the calories and potential mercury poisoning - I practically had to be rolled out!",

    "text": "From all the AYCE sushi places in LV, I think Sakana might be the best. I'd probably give it 4.5 stars.  Location-wise it is pretty similar to other AYCE sushi restaurants, pretty spacious inside and nice interior. The staff are nice and helpful and the food comes out really quick too.  The only downside of Sakana is that the dinner is a bit pricy, $25.95. However, there is a vast selection of food even me and my brother who don't eat raw fish could fill our stomachs with. So this is the perspective of someone who doesn't eat sushi. First off I believe that Sakana has the best selection of desserts from all the AYCE. Just had to bring that out first :) Loved the mini honey toast and green tea pans cotta! Unagi was good and the donkatsu curry was ok. Chicken Kaarage and Pa Fried Chicken was very similar in taste but I liked the kaarage chicken better. The outstanding part of this place was how all the foods weren't salty and just right. Just how we all like it.  All in all everyone liked the place and positively recommend this place.",

The quality was better than all other such restaurants I have yet visited. I only wish it were closer to where I live! But I do not regret one moment of eating here. Sure the wait times to get in were large for our huge group on a busy evening, but the wait was worth it: this place offers such a great menu with a wide variety of options available. We tried items I hadn't seen on a menu on this continent but only in Japan. We ate some specialties that I had never seen elsewhere (I had a sushi donut!). We all ended up really happy with the ratio of fish to rice, the flavour of the foods, the portion sizes and of course the service once we were indeed seated.  The restaurant is not too noisy (which is remarkable given how busy it was). The food and the beverage is absolutely excellent. I highly recommend coming here and I hope to one day eat here again when next I have an opportunity to visit Las Vegas.  There is ample parking here and transit stops just a short walk away.",

We arrived in Vegas by car around 230 or so. Headed over to this place, seated immediately, it was around 2:45. Dinner ayce starts at 3, is five dollars more (30 vs 25) and includes single orders of ama ebi, uni, ocean trout and salmon belly, so it was a no brainier to ask them if we could do dinner. Fortunately they said yes. We ordered tons of nigiri, some skewers, shrimp tempura, miso soup. Everything was fantastic and I've never had such good quality of fish at an AYCE before. We were actually amazed lol. And they brought out the orders insanely quick! I noticed a lot of other places bring them out slow so you have time to get full, but not this place! Best of all my mom loved it and ate a lot (well, a lot for a 90 lb elderly woman at least). She has health problems and it's hard for her to eat sometimes as a result. But she enjoyed the food here very much, as did the rest of us. We will definitely be back and I would recommend you try this place if you come to Vegas.",

Go out into the neighborhoods where you can find really great authentic food that is a very very affordable. This restaurant hotfood options were very delicious. The servers were very attentive and they just kept bringing the food out. They were not shy with the amount of food that they allowed you to order it came out hella fast. My recommendation would be to stick with the hot foods though I enjoyed the bacon and asparagus cures, pork belly OMG freaking fire what a way to start a meal. I also had the bacon wrapped Lobster delicious delicious delicious. My rose were kind of redundant and the way that it was my fault cuz I kept ordering things with cream cheese and shrimp tempura the only difference between the road where the sprinkling on top. And the rice was a little clammy but other than that the overall experience I will definitely give a a a a a minus and I will totally recommended to others enjoy.",

    "text": "Vegas definitely has a number of AYCE sushi restaurants and we've tried some of them before including Oyshi and Goyemon. The latter are really good, but we wanted to try some place new. I decided to Yelp for an AYCE sushi place and stumbled on Sakana--boy am I glad that we did! Hands down one of the best AYCE in Vegas! Price for lunch AYCE IS $21.99 and dinner is $24.99.  The restaurant itself is located in a small plaza with ample parking, although it can get relatively full. The actual restaurant is quaint with cute japanese/sea inspired decors inside. We were seated right away and first thing I noticed on the wall were the recommendations by the Chefs. I found this to be nice, specially since it was our first time going there and as like any new comers, we may need help picking either the most popular or the favorites of the Chefs.  The service itself was great. Never once did we have any empty water glasses and everyone was really nice and polite. The food came out pretty quickly as well, which was a plus.  In terms of the food, all the sushi and apppitizers we tried were delicious! I do recommend for the appetizers to try the pork belly, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and something called \"The Shit,\" which is a stuffed pepper with crab meat.  For the sushi, we tried the Golden Tiger, the Poki/Crab Meat Nachos, the Monkey Brain, the Lemon Shrimp, the Albacore and the Yellowtail. Again, all were very tasty and fresh! Some of the flavor profiles will surprise you, like the Monkey Brain, which plays on the sweet and savory taste as it mixes sauteed banana with the California Roll. Sounds weird, I know, but it is absolutely delicious!   I definitely would recommend everyone to try this place out! If you're an avid sushi fan or just looking for a nice Japanese restaurant to eat at, this place can cater to all. If you don't want the AYCE option, you can also just order per entree. Definitely a must try in Vegas!",

    "text": "Everyone in Vegas has been raving about this ayce sushi place so I decided to give this place a try. Lunch is about $21 and dinner is about $26.   Our server, Kemiko, tried to seat us on a small table when there was plenty of group tables available. Right away, I told her to seat us on a bigger table and she accommodated. She barely gave us the menus and asked for what our order was. I only shot out one order, while searching for other items, but once I realized that I needed a bit more time I let her know I needed a few minutes that caused her to roll her eyes.  I flagged her down when we were ready and I emphasized every item but she just nodded her head. She forgot my extra ginger and I reminded her then she finally brought it out.   I admit that we may have order more than we could eat but we felt that if we left four or five pieces then it would be acceptable. Right when I asked for the check, she rudely said, \"make sure you eat the rest of that since we charge for leftovers.\" I've been to plenty of ayce sushi joints and they were fine with half a roll or less as leftovers. Okay whatever, perhaps she was following policy but she visibly showed she hated her job.   I asked another person for the check and he examined the table and got our check right away. As we left, the busser was the only person who said bye. When we walked past our server, she said nothing.  As for the sushi: it was average. I really don't know what's exceptional for the place. I can understand if you guys have exceptional customer service for average food to retain customers, but to me it was below par customer service for average food. I will not be back.",

The sushi was fresh and the rice amount was not overwhelming to the ration of sashimi. The menu included sweet shrimp and uni but there's a limit of one order per person on these items. My faves were the cooked pork belly, soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura, Sashimi roll & Chirasi salad. Lastly the green tea pannacotta and strawberry & mango mochi were a yummy way to complete the meal.  BTW. The sign on the business outside states Kabuki - but no worries your'e in the right place.",

We decided to check it out because it was the least expensive AYCE sushi dinner that we found in Yelp at $22.95 (others even surpassed $25).  The rolls were not loaded with rice and the fish slices were generous...  Just what the doctor ordered!  The menu has a lot of selections and the Towering Sashimi Poki was the item we enjoyed the most.  It was among the rolls that you can order only once but since there were 4 of us, we maxed this one out.  The Sashimi Roll was delectable, too.  However, I thought it would have been more elegant if it did not have imitation crab in it.  Good food tastes even better with good service.  Our server (Sun) was very attentive and friendly plus she wore a smile everytime.  Morever, the sushi chefs deserved a pat on the back for their plating ideas.  They surely made the food look so appetizing.  It would have been a more satisfying experience if they included sashimi on the menu.  Nonetheless, that seemed to be the norm in LV as all the AYCE sushi joints I called up didn't have it either.  All's good then...",

Your best bet to go is for dinner, I've tried their lunch ayce and it did not compare.  The winners are definitely the one per person dinner items.  Their uni is probably the freshest & sweetest I've tried at an ayce joint.  I love how small their rice portions are, it's the perfect rice to sashimi ratio.  Some of my favorite things include D's Guys Roll, Something Wrong Roll, Baked Mussels, Pork Belly, and Super White Tuna nigiri.  And their monthly specials located on the blackboard have been heaven in my mouth!  Be sure to check it out.  I've gone probably about six times now and with each visit, it gets better.  They try different sauces to top of their Towering Sashimi Poki and other items.  I've noticed they've been changing their menu up by adding Pork Belly and new appetizers as well.    Desserts are also unlimited!  They offer tempura ice cream, deep fried banana, black sesame manger, green tea panna cotta, mochi, and ice cream.  The manger and panna cotta have the consistency of creme brulee minus the caramelized top.  Try them all and find your new favorite.  I always end the night with plum wine ice cream.    The only downside is that they don't have fountain sodas, so no refills... and hot tea is not free either.  But other than that, this place is amazeballs!",

I seen a previous post about the Hispanic crew they have in there and yes they're still there, it shouldn't matter whether their green or purple folks, the food and service is great!!! I definitely recommend this place for good food, just remember 9pm or so it starts to get busy. #cheers",

There was a lot of people waiting in a small little space. There were empty tables that people could have sat on. Terrible at seating people. The guy that did sat us at our table was very friendly(NOT) but the food was good. Feel 50/50 about this place. When food is good and bad service I call no tips",

Big mistake. I came in around 10:45 with 2 other people. When we walked in everyone kind of just stared at us stupidly until finally someone walked up to us to seat us. Should've known from that moment is was going to be bad. We were seated with only ONE menu, then 5 minutes later rushed to order. They said they were putting in there last call so we hurried and ordered but asked for dessert to come at the end of our meal. Well they brought all of our food out extremely fast, clearly half ass cooked and prepared. They started to clean up around us and stack chairs but somehow didn't have time to clean our plates as we were finishing. And of course with still plenty food to eat they brought out our dessert, so we had to hurry and eat our food. Then they all just sat & stared at us to try and get us to eat even faster, it made me so uncomfortable. We were out of there by 11:30. We ate in 30 min even tho the sign said they didn't close until 12. So because they wanted to leave EARLY we were rushed and had such a horrible experience with mediocre food. I will never return.",

The service was fast and they were always there asking if you needed anything. I call that GREAT service! I gave it a four star because this place tasted like all the other amazing sushi places, which means there wasn't a roll that super WOWED me. Also, just an FYI, there are some rolls that you can only get once while you're there so I encourage you to get it during that first round. If you're a local or a traveler, this would be one sushi place I recommend to go to if you want to beat the Strip area and you just want sushi.",

The food is so very good, however the service and lack of regard when it is mentioned is atrocious.  If I call a business at the time they open(1130am) I would expect for someone to take the call. Not the case with this location. I have had the phone answered, been asked to hold, then proceed to wait 20 mins for the person never to pick the phone back up.    If you advise them of multiple orders, they still pack everything together in as few boxes as possible making it hard to separate the orders.   We call in our order due to only having 30 mins to eat.  Pre-ordered food is a blessing as it literally takes 4 mins for us to get there and pick it up.  Going in and ordering takes 25 mins just for them to prepare it, which means no time to eat.   So sad that I will now have to find another sushi spot that can be delivered because I can't spend any more lunch hours hoping they will answer the phone.",

The decor is so cute and staff was very friendly and attentive. Food came put quickly, a few items at a time, and we didn't feel rushed. Decent price and incredible sushi? Cant go wrong here.

Super white tuna. This stuff was good. The ocean trout was really solid too, but you're only allowed one order per person. The crispy rice was pretty good too, but the rice was fried way too long. Overall, the sushi isn't the best quality, but it also is far from bad or fishy.   The reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is because they have random things that are limited to one order, like mushrooms and garlic, and they only have a handful of things that are actually good. I'd say most is mediocre. I also think the dinner price is way more bang for your buck, because there were so many things that are limited to dinner only. We even asked to pay the extra $5 for a dinner menu, but were denied. You don't get uni, amaebi, salmon belly, etc with the lunch price, so I'd recommend coming for dinner!",

We got plates that wasn't ours about 3 times...and not only that but some of the food we ordered never came... i mean its all you can eat but i still prefer not to order my same order multiple times. Anyways all of this wasn't even bothersome until our waiter left never saying bye... and then the female waitress who stepped in for the last 5 mins of our meal got sassy with us. She didn't have a good attitude when taking our last order... and when i ordered a handroll(2nd time) she either didnt hear me or got it wrong (unfortunately for her there was a roll with the same name somewhere on the menu). Its not my fault i even pointed to it when i ordered and it was the same handroll i ordered 10 minutes ago. Anyways when it came and i told her thats not what i wanted.. she said something under her breath that all my friends could here blaming me... took it away and then we could hear her telling/complaining to sushi chef about me. Really wasn't sure if she was doing this so i could hear lol. Oh well... we already tolerated all the wrong orders but something like this i could not...",

For a reasonable price of $20 you can get your tummy full of fancy place style sushi of your choice. I had the Bam Bam roll, Tuna, Salmon, Eel, Mackerel, Masago, Vegas roll, yellowtail roll, sarada lobster, ocean trout, the playboy roll, calimari tempura, and Super White Tuna (Sooooo good. Like seriously. Best food ever) All of it was simply beyond belief. The AYCE also comes with a desert of your choice which I chose tiramisu. and was very impressed with it. For those who drink they have BOGO drink specials pretty much all the time. This is definitely going to be a every Vegas trip stop. And it's not too far off the strip... about a $15 taxi from Vdara or just take the 202 Flamingo eastbound to Maryland.",

The place is so cutely designed and the sushi chefs and hosts are so fun and kind. They're very welcoming to their customers and always looking to satisfy everyone's experience.

    "text": "This was my second time here as people say it's really good food, but I just don't get it. I gave this place another shot because I did not have a choice, to be honest. Last night me and my coworkers, party of 15 ,were planning on going to a new sushi joint, Gorilla sushi, but apparently they were so jam packed they had to close for the night. So I called Yama sushi to make a quick reservation but they had no availability for party of 15. So I ended up calling Sakana and luckily they were able to take us.    We went in and our server greeted us. He seemed very nice. Although I do not know his name in fact he never introduced himself, all I know is that he is an asian guy. So we started ordering by checking off the sushi menu. The server asked us if we want any appetizers and we ordered some. And he took that sheet of paper that we ordered. We waited about good 30 minutes for our nigiris and sushi rolls to come out. Appetizers came out quick so that was good. Overall their appetizers were okay. I ordered a mini udon it was so salty I could not even finish it. Finally our orders came and of course there were a lot of orders. First round about 40-50 orders of nigiris came out. I actually did not get my sushi at that time but I could not wait I was so hungry I had to eat some of my coworkers. I had a garlic tuna nigiri and it was not fresh at all. I was a bit disappointed by the quality of fish.   My orders did not come so I patiently waited and was expecting that other nigiris are better. And when our server brought our orders and he literally said, \"You guys are ordering way too much!!! It's like 50 rolls and a bunch of other orders!!\" We were all like WTF???? Hello? Don't you know that there are 15 of us and of course there is gonna be tons of orders. I was dumbfounded. It's not like 4 people ordering tons there are 15 PEOPLE dude!! Also he made faces when he said that. I get his point but they way he said it was not pleasant and unprofessioanal. He could have just said nicely. It almost seemed like he has two faces. At first he greeted us with a smile and now he's bitc*ing at us. Haha! What kind of service are you providing? I started to get very annoyed as I was STILL waiting for my order. However, our server brought us wrong orders several times. Then that ticked some of us off. Half of my party started complaining about their orders have not came out, some said 2/3 of their orders some said half of their orders were missing. To be honest, at that time we all patiently waited and waited. I wanted to complain to their manager but I did not want to ruin our night. So I let it go this time. But I did reordered my uni nigiris it took them another 15 minites so I finally got my order. As soon as I looked at uni I could tell it was almost going bad. The color was almost yellowish brown and the texture was foamy. I got so grossed out by just looking at it. So I just dumped all of them inside the miso soup. I know I should not be doing that but I thought they deserve it because I did not want to get sick. I had a bad experience with uni nigiris so I know I can tell if they are fresh or not.  I understand the restaurant's point of view where a bunch of people ordering so many different things at once or whatever but you cannot treat customers like that. He talked down to us as if we were pigs or something. Also, I would have given another star if their food were decent and they were not. I really don't get the hype here. You can go to many other sushi places, seriously. A lot of us ended up tipping him less than normal. I gave him around 3 bucks for my check. Some of my coworkers gave him 1 buck, lol. I think they deserve less tips. Today at work we talked about what happened last night and we came to a conclusion; they purposely igonored 2/3 of all the orders that were placed. We could have understood if one or two or even a few orders were missing, there were like 20 other items that we waited for nothing.   Overall, I was just so embrassed because I took our coworkers to this place and we all had a bad expereince.   Food (2.5/5) Service (0.5/5) PERIOD!! I am not ever coming back to this freakin place. Please be aware if you go in large groups they WILL ignore your orders.",

I regret not going more than once while I was in vegas. When my friend first told me about this place, I didn't expect it to be as good as she was describing it. I had to experience it for myself, so my last trip to vegas I made sure to check it out. This is a AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi restaurant. The best part about this is its $20 for AYCE sushi for lunch and $30 AYCE for dinner I believe. I made sure to go onto yelp to see what everyone's favorites are. There were two things that I cannot get out of head until this day. That was the super white tuna and lemon salmon. MY OH MY, That was by far the best tasting fish I have ever had in my life. My only regret was not ordering more. After finishing our meal, we were stuffed and had to catch our flight. I will never forget the happiness that Sakana brought me. The staff was friendly as well and the restaurant was clean. I do not recommend this place for large groups (more than 8). I am thinking about taking a trip back to vegas just to eat here. I wish they had a place like this in miami. Not only did the fish taste great, but it was fresh for AYCE. I will definitely be back here when I come back to vegas. It is off the strip, but well worth the uber drive.",

Staff is great at their job could be more personable. Nothing to complain about but that's one area of improvement. Can't really tell if there is a manager present or not.   Sushi was ok. It tastes like most places. Nothing over the top. The lemon salmon roll was not too pleasing. I found the California roll and Salmon Lover Roll the best.",

    "text": "One of the best AYCE sushi places I've been to! The only aspects I don't like are the ordering system and service (because of the ordering system). Usually, you get a piece of paper and mark the quantity of each item you want; here, you have to tell your server your order, which can be pretty extensive. Because of the ordering system, you could expect the service to be slow and hectic. We asked for sriracha sauce three times to three different people before finally giving up. It wasn't until the end of our meal that someone remembered and brought it to us.  However, these little complaints are completely overshadowed by the sushi. The fish just melts in your mouth! I also appreciated the fish to rice ratio. We also got the baked lobster roll...x 5. This was one of my favorites (tied with salmon, of course). I noticed some sushi places I've been to in SoCal give less and less lobster with each order, but not here! The food here was consistent with every order. I'm in Philly now, and I wish they can open up a restaurant here!",

    "text": "I'm updating this review because we were back last weekend - this place is so awesome, we pretty much just have to go there every time we're in Vegas. It is definitely still just as awesome as I remembered - actually if anything, even better. We got in a little after noon on Sunday, and I was expecting a big line, but we walked right in, sat down, and started getting sushi pretty much immediately. Everything we ordered was fantastically fresh and delicious - I especially want to call out the salmon, which was not only some of the best salmon I'd had, they were also enormous pieces of perfectly-cut fishmeat, on top of the perfect amount of rice (i.e. enough to taste the rice, but really not very much). The rest of the nigiri was also excellent, I just wanted to call out how totally perfect the salmon was.   I also have to call out one crazy appetizer: I forgot what it was called, but they suggested we try it, and it was amazing. Lightly cooked fish (tuna, I think) on top of mini pieces of garlic bread. I wouldn't get too much of it, as it was also clearly drenched in butter or something, so it was super filling (unlike nigiri, which is the best part about all you can eat high quality nigiri!), but also, mega delicious.   Service was flawless from start to finish, and the couple rolls we tried were also great (though really, with this much selection of fish this fresh, you totally want to focus more on the fresh fish).  I totally loved their version of an affrogato for dessert, too (with Vietnamese sweet creamy coffee).  As long as they continue to knock it out of the park like they have up until now (this was our third time here), I will most likely continue to visit Sakana every time I'm in Vegas.",

We were well taken care of from the very beginning. Our server was friendly, attentive and helpful and when she wasn't available, other servers would step in and assist. The sushi chef provided our group with some super white tuna nigiri and it was amazing. We ordered other various nigiri, appetizers (including The Shit (bomb!!!), Pang (SO. GOOD!!!), Dynamite, Gyoza and others) plus tons of different sushi rolls. The sushi rolls can come in half or full orders, which is great because whenever I go to AYCE sushi places, I feel you're backed into a corner on ordering full rolls which usually ends up being too much food. The service here is also wonderful since they actually allow you to order whatever your heart desires whenever you're ready versus other places I've been to that will take your order in the beginning then you never see them again then... You're full and don't get the most of an AYCE. We also ordered Sake bombs which was brought just as everything else, quickly and cheerfully. The food was great and the staff was even better, this is definitely going to be a staple every time I visit Vegas in the future!",

We came for AYCE lunch sushi and everything was very good and fresh. You can request half orders of most of the rolls on the menu which was great bc we were able to try many different rolls. Of all the things we ordered (too many to list and I can't remember them all now), I really liked the hamachi kama, baked lobster and dragon rolls, and garlic tuna and ocean trout nigiri.",

The sushi comes out SUPER fast compared to other spots i have been all over town. The fish is always fresh, and i do like the interesting combinations they offer from the \"norm\" at other spots. And as i mentioned in my previous post, the rice/fish ratio is just bananas! The place is far from my home, but i have determined worth the drive to come out of my way for more often. If i only had one gripe (but its a preference) that they use less mayo, but that's my own personal tastes so no stars deducted. If i had to ask for something for Xmas, it would be you open another location near my home.",

    "text": "Given the location, it is hard to expect fresh and high-quality fish at most sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I have been to Makino, Island Grill/Sushi, Rainbow and Kobe for AYCE sushi and I can assure you, Sakana is one of the best AYCE sushi spot for its service and quality.  SERVICE From reading other reviews, it seems that service here is hit or miss. Fortunately, my server (Carlos) was on top of his A game. He was not only knowledgeable, but also friendly and attentive. My water was filled the entire time and Carlos constantly checked if we needed anything.   I was also pleasantly surprised by the wait time. Keep in mind, this place was packed with no empty seats at 1PM on Sunday. It literally took 5-10 minutes for all the food to get to our table. Fast, but none of the items we got were sloppy by any means. Every dish was perfectly presented. Billion times infinity and beyond thumbs up for their amazing chef and staffs. You guys rock!  SUSHI AYCE is $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. I highly suggest you pay that extra $4 and come here at night because there are much more selections. They are not stingy with the cuts. If you look at Nigiri, you can see how thick and generous the cut is. I hate when AYCE sushi place pack ridiculous amount of rice. I'm sorry but I'm not paying over $20 to eat rice. All the sushi we got here had nice thick cuts of fish with the perfect amount of rice. Things I tried:  Nigiri 5/5 Ocean trout garlic ponzu (one time only) 5/5 Garlic ponzu albacore 5/5 Spider Roll 5/5 Yakitori 5/5 Garlic ponzu mackerel 3/5 Agedashi Tofu 4/5 Green tea panacotta 5/5 Tiramisu 1/5  I got hooked on their Green Tea Panacotta. It's made in the house and has rich matcha flavor. Super creamy and it was delightful. I got 4 of this.... #yolo  Pass on that Tiramisu. It was rock hard and was ridiculously sweet. Had a medicine aftertaste.   CONCLUSION Exceptional service and quality of food. I would come back in a heartbeat!",

We had to put down our name when we got here and they told us it would be a 30 min wait, a hour passed and we decided to check and see how much longer it would take and the so happened to skip our name, so they cleared a table quick and sat us there (party of 4).   Now, the order my process was TERRIBLE! We sat for a additional 40 min before our food came out! Not only did they take long they brought the wrong sushi rolls out. We let the server know what happened and he pointed at one of the cooks and said \"he's new and he sucks\"! REALLY?!! Now that's when I decided to write this as I was there simply because I'm a cook! When you sit there and point fingers it really looks bad on you! Not only are you bringing someone else down your bringing yourself down, you guys are a TEAM! As far as the flavors went... they were delicious! Thumbs up for the BOH! Now FOH, work on your service skills!",

It is in the same shopping center as Target, near the Absolute Dental place.  Yes, the sign outside does not say \"Sakana\" but \"Kabuki\"  Yes, I did feel like I was dining in someones basement...but I didn't come here for ambiance, I came for Sushi!  Yes, the food is really good, and cheaper for AYCE dinner.  The service was great at this place, very attentive!   I loaded up myself with all the Yellow tail I wanted, try the Joe's Special roll, so delicious my mouth is watering as I type this. The Monkey Brains was an interesting, but delicious roll.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.This is probably one of the best Sushi spots! Price is reasonable for the amount of food you get!! Never disappoints!!  First time coming here as I read reviews on yelp so my mom and I decided to try this place. . I've been to other places here before it was our first time coming to Sakana for AYCE sushi! The price isn't too bad at about $25.95 per person. We came here on a Friday night and waited about 3 mins. and we sat at the sushi bar. Place is a bit small but very different and unique.  Good thing about this place is that not only was the sushi good, but also their service. Fast service and great service with help all the time from picking up your empty plates to refilling your drink. The food came quick. Out of all the sashimi and suhi/sushi rolls we ordered, the only thing that wasn't cooked right was the shrimp's head as they weren't really fresh. Besides that, I can't really complain much about this place. I would highly recommended this place and we will come back here for a AYCE sushi. THE BEST SUSHI IN VEGAS SO FRESH.  So glad I found one amazing sushi place here that's fresh and delicious. Thank you SAKANA",

    "text": "$25 for AYCE Sushi dinner!  Besides the AYCE option, they also have the a la carte as well... but I can't imagine anyone doing a la carte when there's the former option!    We came here on the Fourth of July thinking there would be a line.  To our surprise, there was no line and tables were aplenty and the sushi bar was pretty much empty.  We sat at the sushi bar and the chef started us up with the Chef's recommendation and it was quite yummy.  I didn't know what was in the roll, but the salmon sushi was yummy.    The Good:  The fish-to-rice ratio at this place was perfect.  All of their sushi, with the exception of the uni, were fresh.  It's too bad they didn't have the oyster that was on the menu available.  Our favorite sushi of the night were the Super White Tuna, Albacore, and Garlic Tuna.  The Salmon wasn't bad either!  Seafood Salad definitely contained A LOT of sashimi and its sauce had a good kick to it.  Udon and grilled mackerel were both pretty good as well.  The Bad:  The Uni and Amaebi wasn't that interesting despite the fact that they are one order per person dinner only options.  Neither was \"the shit\".  Seaweed Salad was a bit on the salty side compared to other places I've tried.  Something to consider:  All the fish were pre-cut (maybe to speed up the service speed?).  Overall, the staff was very attentive and the parking was definitely not an issue.  I'll definitely coming back since there are so much more items on the menu I have yet to try!",

I am ALLERGIC to seaweed & cucumbers. He said the first 2 rolls are free but the rest will be an EXTRA $1.50 per roll. Didn't. Even. Care. You'd think, at LEAST for mine, it would be ok. Being that I can only eat a few rolls.....4 tops. Needless to say; we wont be back.",

First time was great, this time inedible. The quality of their red snapper has also gone down, what used to be my 2nd favorite item on the menu. Eel is still good. If i return, will probably just stick to that. Tamago still overly sweet like always.   I don't like how they changed the white cabbage they used to serve with appetizers to lettuce. Lettuce just cannot do the job of palate cleansing that white cabbage can do.",

Lol anyway, I love the portion of their nigiri from rice to fish bc if they had ayce sashimi I'd give them a 4 star...   I've gone there about 4 times... the first time the service was horrible. Server seemed as if he didnt care to help us... which made me not want to come back. But I always keep going hoping the next time I go they would change my mind on how I feel about their service! But they always seem to disappoint me...   Wait now thinking about it.. I did have one great experience. The chef gave me a bomb slice of fish on my nigiri! I'll admit that made me happy...  Seriously sakana, I'd give you a 5 star if you get employees that actually act like they enjoy their job.. or maybe they act like they do anytime before 10pm? I normally come after work. Which I get there at 10ish .. maybe at that time the servers are check out.",

    "text": "All fun must come to the end and this holds True to my once all time favorite sushi joint.  First off, this spot is hidden so finding it makes you feel sort of exclusive.  The location is nestled behind the target and next to a rims store.  Second this place used to be called Kabuki so don't be confused, this is the place you're looking for.   Nice decor.  Decorated with traditional japanese style art and they play anything from Korean music videos to Hayao Miyazaki films!  Unlike most AYCE, this place does offer special items on their menu that is above the dining area on a chalk board.  The only other place I know that does this is Goyemon but the specialty items they have to offer are often unavailable (i.e. toro).  Their AYCE sushi is priced at 22 dollars for dinner and is definitely worth checking out maybe a few months ago but now the quality has depreciated since my first few encounters.  The restaurant is typically empty probably because the sign outside hasn't been changed and its difficult to locate. That being said, service is very attentive and the servers are often floating around not doing much so they're practically always available.    The food was great but the quality of fish has really gone down since they first opened up.  I'm a big nigiri guy since you're paying for the fish and the cut on the fish is now so thin.  Big disappointment since the cuts of fish used to be so thick and overwhelmed the rice.   They have a nice selection of appetizers ranging from your traditional shrimp tempura to korean influences such as bulgogi.  My favorite is the pork belly, bulgogi nacho and galbi.  Rolls are nice and are garnished well.  Presentation of the rolls are very neat and served as soon as they are made.  A nice selection of rolls however the rolls can get hard to distinguish since they look very similar to one another.  My favorite rolls are the towering sashimi poke, shrimp lovers, popcorn lobster and something wrong roll.  Unlimited dessert!! Nothing else to say about that  Overall this restaurant was initially my favorite, hole in the wall AYCE sushi joint.  However the quality has gone down quite a bit since they first opened.  I hope that the dinner i had a few days ago was just bad night and not routine.",

Their rolls and nigiri were served a bit differently than what I'm used to in California but not in a bad way. Little tweaks to classic recipes here and there and BAM: delicious sushi.  ALSO, our waitress was awesome - attentive, helpful, and all while serving 3-4 other tables.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",

We came for lunch today and the restaurant had maybe 4 tables.  We sat for an hour and only 4 sushi items came out.  Being in the industry ourselves, we not only consider the food tasting good, but also the service.  We sat and continued to wait but nothing was coming to the table, there were 3 sushi chefs behind the bar.. What we ordered wasn't by any means more than what we could eat.  We couldn't wait anymore and just asked for the check.  Just ridiculous.  There are way better places to go than Sakana.   We will never return again.",

I love that they offer some things I don't normally see on menus like salmon belly and ocean trout. 'Twas delicious! The rolls were tight and interesting. I especially love all the different choices for deep fried and baked etc. that are available. What I didn't like was the canned drink think. I drink a lot and went through three cans of soda at a $1.50 a piece. Not a bad price but most competitors do the buy one drink, free refills thing. Soda fountains take up space though so I can understand. My other minor complaints are that the chefs make the nigiri differently from one another (not sure about rolls) some come out with lots of rice tightly squeezed, others have loose rice and fish. The sticky rice didn't seem so sticky and a few things fell apart, but honestly these were only minor annoyances to an otherwise delightful meal. If you like sushi you've got to try this spot!",

The sushi I had the pleasure of inhaling here last night is the way sushi should be. Fresh, delicious, absolute perfection! When we walked in we were greeted by what seemed to be a very happy bunch of employees!  We got seated immediately at the sushi bar and within minutes we had our drinks and appetizers!  We both did AYCE which was $24.95 each for dinner. I think its something like $20.95 for lunch. Decent prices for the amount of options and rolls you have to choose from! This place probably had the largest selection of specialty rolls than any other sushi place I have been to in the past. And with fun, exciting names like the Playboy and the Wet Dream who wouldn't want to eat here??  Rolls:  Shrimp Lover Roll Lobster Roll Dancing Dragon Roll Superman Golden Dragon Playboy Wet Dream  Apps:  Seaweed Salad Spicy Edamame Baked Mussels Good Shit  Dessert:  Fried Banana  Everything was a 5/5! My only warning is that the spicy edamame was no joke spicy like my mouth was on fire and my eyes were watering! It was delicious but very very hot!!  Cant wait to come back here!",

Joes Special(9) is based with a vinegar sauce. Lobster roll(10) doesnt slack on its name because you get your lobster! Popcorn Lobster roll(10) had to be my favorite for the day, so its a must when you visit. Shrimp Tempura(7) could have been better if it was fried for an additional minute. (batter mouth :P) The strawberry, mango, and mocha Mochi(10) deserts are unlimited which surprised me.  Dishes are prepared like they should be, more meat and less rice! Spacious and newly renovated inside plus they offer a couple private areas for large groups. What i thought was unique was that they made an artistic design of their menu on the wall.   Nothing i consumed had me wondering how fresh their ingredients were. Cant wait for my next visit!",

My gf and I were craving sushi but want to try new place because yama was too far. Ironically we came to sakana which was 1 street close to the west side lol but wanted to try it out because of their review. I honestly didn't expect too much because trying new sushi place is like looking for cheap 5 stars hotel (hopeless). Food: 4-5 majority of the things we ordered was yummy but the really soggy deep fried roll was disgusting lol. Their nigiri was sooooooo good! small portion of rice under big fresh salmon! nom nom nom Service: 4-5 The lady was super nice! She came by every once awhile to ask if everything was okay. We still had to wait to get our check because she disappeared right when we finish",

    "text": "Interesting.  I'd been wanting to try this place ever since reading Amber-Rose K.'s groundbreaking review, and I finally got my chance today. Parking was a bit tougher than in the old days of Kabuki Dining Bar (previous ownership) since there's now more places open in this small plaza. You can still see the old signage and the same layout from Kabuki, and there's still some of the old specialty desserts (green tea panna cotta, black sesame blanc manger). Everything else is different.  This place reminds me of Sushi Koma. It's kinda a Koma-lite if you live on this side of town and aren't trying to find sushi at 2 am or whatnot. Adorning nigiri with sauces and whatnot is reminiscent of Koma, and here they also have interesting appetizers including the crispy rice (loved it), the bulgogi nachos (careful with the cream cheese), and a recently added appetizer in red text (I won't type the name here because some might find it offensive).  I wasn't told in advance that you place nigiri and roll orders on paper (may not be applicable to bar area seating). It's something I've only seen in California, never Vegas, but it actually does help you plan out your meal. You still verbalize order appetizers, specials, and desserts, so no worries there.  I've started to find that some places will honor dinner prices (and therefore menus) at early hours, so I was also able to get the sashimi salad (really good), sashimi roll (wrapped in unobtrusive cucumber) and some of the dinner-only specials from the board including toro steak (basically seared and sauced), salmon belly (always welcome), and a white fish sashimi kinda thing that was pleasant (see pictures).  The biggest improvement over Kabuki (and vs. Koma, actually) is that Sakana does not limit you on dessert. I'm a big dessert guy, and I tried a little bit of almost everything. The sweet and smooth plum ice cream was the best, the mango mochi was as expected, and the black sesame blanc manger was a nice change of pace. I was disappointed that the green tea ice cream was a little lacking in flavor and was too icy compared to the plum as well as to a superior green tea ice cream at Goyemon.  I can't really put my finger on why I didn't get the best impression from this visit. I enjoyed a lot of items, and I liked having the dinner specials for just $22.95 (vs. $20.95 lunch). Maybe it was the nigiri. The fish-to-rice ratio is great, but each piece didn't fill my mouth as much as I'm used to since the fish comes in long and thin slices. It could also be that I just hadn't built up enough of an appetite at lunchtime. Most likely, however, I'd say it was because I just had the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas twice this week, and that place just crushes Sakana in a direct competition. I'm willing to return here, and you should give this a try if you're an AYCE fan, but I prefer some of the other places just a little more.",

    "text": "Wow. This place gave me and my gf serious foodgasms. We are used to regular good sushi in The Netherlands, but not Ayce sushi. What an introduction this was.  It's a small place where the tables are thankfully just far apart enough for private conversation. The waiters were attentive. The only downside is that we felt rushed, they wanted as many people in and out asap. After our second order the question if we wanted dessert already popped. The music was loud and fast, not in place for a restaurant like this.   However, I rate restaurants mostly on their food and food experience and that my people, was astonishing. We went 2 nights in a row, just so we could try a lot of the menu. The fish was fresh, the rolls had great flavour balance and everything melted on our tongues. We had some Pork belly, tuna and some delightful mixed rolls. The vegas roll, japanese lasagna and 49'ers roll had us on the floor dying out of sheer bliss.   On top of that, during weekdays you don't have to wait that long and the price is low in comparison to the food! They compensate that by their in and out policy and rushed service. Overall 5 stars!",

Pang - seafood served on a piece of toast and baked with cheese. Holy cow is it delicious! Make sure to get this one too! Dragon balls - also very good.

    "text": "I was excited to learn about a new place near work, though it is unlikely I would eat there for lunch due to crazy parking limitations (at work getting a spot upon return).  However, I can always stop by for dinner.  Eric R. and I went here this past weekend prior to my dropping him off at the airport.  We were seated at the bar in front of Chef Sai and also Chef Dragon (truly a cool name!) - the service and interaction with the sushi chefs was remarkable.  Our server was on the quiet/shy side, but she was certainly nice and refilled our drinks as needed.  The only app I ordered was the shishito peppers, which were teeny tiny but tasty and covered with bonito flakes.  We had a lot of sushi options.  I nearly passed out when I saw the specials board read \"YUZU YELLOWTAIL BELLY\" but alas, no belly in stock.  Instead, we got salmon belly so that is a fine swap.  There is a delicious yuzu sauce similar to Monta Chaya's drizzled on sushi like tai.  We got whole scallop that was slightly seared via blowtorch also.  Eric R. was happy because he could order half rolls of many kinds of rolls to try.  I got a salmon skin handroll which was delicious.  I did not see handrolls on the menu but Chef Sai happily obliged.  I got amaebi which did not come with heads initially but were happily given upon request.  We also got the cocaine which is a super spicy sauced sashimi salad.  The sauce has habanero oil and gave my nose a nice run hehehe.  Saba is house cured and very tasty.   Chef Dragon gave us an assortment of the freshest of the day for us to try, including, sake, escolar, maguro, and hamachi.  I also got tako with lemon (asked for sesame oil but it may have been misheard).  I ended with the super rich dessert uni with quail egg.  The quality was quite good.  The ambiance is very different from its predecessor Kabuki, and it is painted dark and is a bit funky behind the sushi bar, with pictures and written menu like Ichiza's walls.  Great conversation with sushi chefs.  I will return.",

We came here because of the rave reviews we heard! So I was naturally kind of excited. We started off with appetizers and it came out pretty quickly, the only thing that irked me was that you could only order one skewer each...really? Plus they were really small! They had a special appetizer called \"The sh*t\" and something else...(they were in red on the menu) kind of joke, as they were just mayonnaise/fish on top of bread.  As for the nigiri, I liked it. It was fresh! Maybe very long though haha. Only reason I'm giving you guys 3 stars.  We hung out a little bit after our meal as we were still catching up with our friend, and one of the busboys came by saying, \"are you guys done with your water?\" We all looked at him awkwardly and said no. After this, three other employees circled around our table, obviously wanting us to boot. Seriously guys, rude as heck!  Improve your service please, and then I might bump up my review. Maybe.",

Portions of fish were huge, all sparkling with fresh flavor.  The prices were great too and it reminded us of being back in Japan in a little cafe, only better.  Don't miss this beauty!",

    "text": "There must be several AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, and they all probably charge around $20 for lunch.  This just happens to be the one I found through my brother and now it's on my Vegas \"must do\" list, along with places like Earl of Sandwich and Fat Tuesday.  So $21 gets you AYCE lunch items, along with appetizers, skewers (one each), and one dessert item.  They have a good selection of appetizers, nigiri and rolls (traditional, hand and special).  I don't know about other people, but me and my friends zero in on nigiri when we go to an AYCE sushi place.  Not to say the rolls aren't good, but they are so varied and contain so many ingredients, it's hard to tell what's what and sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between rolls in terms of taste.  Anyway, the rolls have funny names and again, they are good.  But I'm partial to nigiri.  The variations of albacore and yellowtail are my personal favorites, but they have your basic tunas and salmons as well, along with more exotic stuff like salmon eggs, oyster, and the like.  Every now and then you'll get a piece of fish that seems like it was recently frozen (it probably was), but still very good.  Fish like salmon and seared stuff is usually very buttery.  I did like how they had the written order system before, but now they take your order for everything.  I think it's easier to write things down in terms of keeping track of amounts, but it's not a huge deal.  Service is great and the food comes out quickly.",

Met up with an out of town friend after she had gone to a show. It was late and she wanted to eat sushi. Checked Sakana's website and they were open till midnight.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. Took our drink order immediately. Kevin, our waiter came over with our menus and actually sat down with us to take our orders. He asked questions and made suggestions based on our answers. He also insisted on our trying a few new items. He suggestions were spot on. Food was delicious and we very well attended to. That may been due to the late hour but I never felt rushed. Food was delicious and nicely presented . When Kevin brought our check he had changed the way we ordered to save us some money. We had both ordered All you can eat but he figured it out that was cheaper to charge singly for my friends items as she did not eat that much. Overall a great late night dining experience . Made me feel pretty smart for going there.  Way to go Kevin. You are an asset to your place of business. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "We just arrived into vegas and had lunch here on Thursday. My sister HIGHLY recommended this place to me. I think our server \"Silvia\" probably wasn't having the best day. She was serving us alright. She wasn't amazing, but she wasn't horrible. We were 5 adults and 2 babies. The 5 adults did the AYCE.   We got through lunch and it was time for dessert! My mom ordered 2 tempura ice cream, 1 honey toast, 1 fried banana, and 1 panna cotta. We received the panna cotta super quick. I guess they have it ready and refrigerated. My mom loved it and asked a different server for another one, which she got right away. When the rest of the desserts arrived there was only 1 of each. I got \"Silvia's\" attention to notify her that we were short 1 tempura ice cream. Her response verbatim \"You only get 1 dessert person and you already got your 5\". We were a bit confused and then she mentioned my mom ordered another panna cotta. Which is completely fine, but I was curious how she decided to edit the \"original\" order. We ordered the second panna cotta AFTER we ordered the 2 tempura ice creams. I waited to pay the check and wanted to speak to her about her delivery. I understand they have policies, but didn't appreciate the way she spoke to me. She took a while to come back around, so I walked the bill up to the cashier. I then informed the cashier of the situation. That she should of informed us kindly that it's 1 dessert per person and that she would be happy to give us another panna cotta for an additional charge OR if we wanted to swap it for another dessert. From the corner of my eye I saw her standing to the left of me. I turned to her to speak to her and then she tells me with the attitude that \"your mother only ordered 1 tempura ice cream\". All of a sudden her excuse changed? She even did the neck snap when she spoke to me. I turned to the cashier and said \"did you see that\"? He then apologized to me and said he'll speak to her. I was soooo SHOCKED! I cannot believe someone who chooses to be a server, who's job revolves around customer service can be so rude!!!  The restaurant is clean and the food is good! Just try not to get Silvia as your server. :)",

Our server(Hailey?) was really good, really fast and attentive.  However, this place is very hot. I think, they don't have enough A/C.",

    "text": "I was really excited about trying a new sushi place! You know me... I tend to stick with the restaurants that I love. Sakana caught my eye as I was Yelping so we decided to venture out of our comfort zone.   The verdict... The nigri quality wasn't very fresh. Salmon was a bit slimy, octopus was rubbery and tasted like it had freezer burn and some other things were just really \"fishy.\"  The good part about the nigri was that there was hardly any rice. The yellowtail and squid were decent but other than that I wasn't too impressed.   The rolls were good but I think the sauce covered up a lot of the extra fishy taste and smell. I ended up ordering things from the kitchen like the soft shell crab (really good actually) and calamari tempura to fill up my stomach.   We were the only ones there for lunch which was a bit weird for a Saturday. The service was attentive and even though it wasn't the best sushi that I've ever had I hope it does well. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't venture back in if I am on this side of town.",

I had tuna, white tuna, salmon, uni and unagi. My uni was not that fresh but I liked it anyway. I also enjoyed their appetizers, like their agedashi tofu and oysters. Their ebi tempura was fresh and tasty, although I found the batter too thick.  I had the green tea panna cotta for dessert. It was light and had a creamy consistency.

I can't remember who recommended this place to me and since I'm a sucker for new restaurants I said why not. Glad I did! Service is quick and friendly. Fish is fresh and portions are reasonable.

The server came immediately! We got our drinks within 2 minutes, placed our order for AYCE and (are you ready for this?) the food came in under 5 minutes. The nigeri pieces were humongous and just as tasty. The fish is fresh!! There was a great assortment of rolls and we tried a few. Delish! You have to try this place. Nice, casual atmosphere, professional servers and good prices. What more could you ask for? I will make this my \"GO TO\" Sushi place in town from now on.

    "text": "We took a short ride from the strip purely based on the great Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. We also didn't know this spot was All You Can Eat, so the value was even better than expected. With the AYCE price ($20ish for lunch), I can't see anyone just paying the a la carte prices.    The food was excellent, from the sushi rolls, to the nigiri, and various Japanese dished everything tasted great. The Salmon kama was particularly great.  One thing to note is that it's a bit tricky to find. If you're looking directly at Target it's to the right around the corner.   Definitely worth heading off strip for the great food and way better value.",

They had \"cans\" of lemonade this had to order a can of lemonade and a ice tea.  Found that very odd.  Never saw it before.  Anyway, the sushi was fresh and roll choices extensive.  And they do 1/2 rolls.  Which puts them in top three for AYCE sushi in Vegas.  You must try. For 25.99 you can't go wrong....",

Customer service: 5/5 As soon as you walk in, everybody greets you. We usually go for lunch so there is never a line. Once you are seated the workers are always checking up on you and making sure you always have food in your belly.  Da food: 5/5 This is one of the few AYCE restaurants in the valley that have large fish portions and little rice. The fish has always tasted good and fresh and the flavor for the specialty rolls is awesome, some of our favorites is the super white tuna, my shit, monkey brain and lemon salmon.   Da rolls: Another awesome part of this place is that they offer half portion specialty rolls, lets you taste a lot more food for the same price.  Da price: 5/5 they have the same price as the rest of the AYCE restaurants in the rest of the valley.  Overall 5/5: If you are looking for a bomb ass AYCE restaurant for a good price this place right here takes the cake. They offer a great selection of rolls, specialty rolls, and sashimi options, the fish to rice portions is great.",

The specialty rolls are really good - we just tried a bunch of half rolls so we could sample a lot. And we did! Service was good too. I really enjoy both Yama and Sakana, and I think Yama is better for a time when you just want to eat a lot. Sakana is better for when you want to have a sushi date!",

There was no line, but we had to wait approx 10 mins for an open table for 3.  There are many tables for 2 and the rest were for larger groups, which were all taken on arrival.    The place was packed with Asian patrons, which seemed like a good sign...and sure enough, that proved True.  We had the AYCE @ $25.95, green tea was another $1.50 (unlimited refills).  The sushi was fresh and delicious, especially the yellowtail and salmon.  Tried the rainbow roll, the Lisa Lisa roll, unagi sushi, baked mussels, raw oysters, veggie tempura, and the surf clam sushi.  For dessert we had green tea and plum (ume) ice cream along with mango filled mochi ice cream.     All items that we chose were excellent.  Could not find anything that we didn't like.  Wait staff was courteous and helpful with our questions.  Did notice that of the 5 chefs, only one was Asian (I just found that humorous).  Will definitely return!",

I had so many AYCE sushi in Vegas. This place is the best of the best by far. They have so many amazing choices and the fishes swim in my mouth. Their cut is way larger than most AYCE restaurants. It is very generous of them. I really like their cucumber salad and I asked for spicy ponzu sauce instead of their original peanut sauce. They are really nice and willing to substitute. Must try their mini toast with greentea ice cream for dessert. You will be 200% satisfied.",

Truth is this place is a 5 for AYCE, but it's AYCE quality which means it's relatively simple sushi with heavy sauces. The nigiri is superb though and I recommend the garlic tuna and super white tuna. Yelp page hooked me on $22 for dinner when it's actually $26, but It's still a GREAT deal. Get the No Name roll too, it's by far the favorite although the What the Hell is a close second. Affogato and Honey Toast for dessert is by far the best. Enjoy Yelp!",

They have good appetizers here and I really like that they just give you a good portion so you won't feel full to try the other stuff. We highly recommend to try the skewers,fried rice and baked mussels. For the sushi rolls:Chanel rolls (sooo good), and something wrong roll. Try also their seared salmon and for dessert Afforgato is the best choice!.. Overall great food and very good servers. We will definitely come back when we come in LV again.",

It's all I've ever wanted in a sushi place: great interior, friendly staff, big fat buttery slices of fish on my nigiri, instagram-worthy rolls that are too pretty to eat, and  everything just tasting damn delectable!  This honestly is a hidden gem because it's in the very corner of the shopping center next to Target, kinda easy to miss. If it wasn't for Yelpers giving rave reviews of this place, I would have never even stepped foot in this place. You've done well, Yelpers.   I would say the stand outs for this place is definitely their nigiri. For such a simple dish, they manage to make each nigiri special by dressing them with their own unique sauce. My friend ended up ordering 6 orders of the Super White because it's just that good. The mackerel and smoked salmon nigiri is also up there on my list! Their specialty rolls are also super fancy. They really go into town with their presentation, which is surprising because service here is quite speedy. I recommend the bam bam roll cuz it's jam packed with fresh fish and none of that cream  cheese nonsense.  AYCE prices are also amazing for the quality! Lunch: $20.95 Dinner: $25.95",

The fish to rice ratio is great, and there is more variety than any other AYCE place I can think of. We especially liked the ocean trout (you only get one per person) and the yuzu albacore.",

    "text": "CAUTION! This location solicits for reviews and it is obviously affecting their rating system. They have fliers on each table offering a free drink if you show them a completed and posted Yelp review! This is wrong! That said, this was a HUGE disappointment!   The bad (besides the HUGE offense already mentioned):  The cuts of sushi are thick but poorly sliced. The Eel was burned and the BBQ sauce was WAY too sweet! Wasabi is a paste (which is ok since real wasabi is hard to come by) but this was so heavy in horse radish that it was terrible! The California rolls have a mushy mayonnaise paste like filling. I understand some sushi places do this and while I don't like it generally, this was inedible.    The reason for two stars (instead of 1):  Our service wasn't terrible. While she did forget our sake, but the staff was generally friendly and prompt. They do have some interesting specials. There is an all-you-can-eat option (both lunch and dinner) which is well executed and does leave dollars in you wallet. So that's a bonus. And the 2 for 1 drinks is a nice touch. While the sushi is mediocre, the all-you-can-eat and drinks specials are nice.  BOTTOM LINE: Sakana does NOT deserve the 5 star reviews it continually gets. It solicits for these reviews and requires a patron to show the POSTED review to get a free drink. (Naturally, this will encourage a guest to give a higher review since it must be shown while dining) This is appalling! Even if the specials were enough to entice me back, their unethical Yelp abuse forces me to boycott this location until it is remedied.",

    "text": "Sakana is close to another local favorite AYCE called Yama. If I could only choose one of these two I'd definitely pick Sakana.   I liked the place as soon as I walked in. It looks like a cute little restaurant decked out in Japanese stuff. It was a cute environment and fun to look at everything they had going on.  It's about $20 for lunch until 3:00p and then it goes up like $3 for dinner. It's a great price as most AYCE places are about $27 for dinner. Sakana also has all of the premium items you pay the extra couple of bucks for like uni, oysters, ect. It's definitely worth the price in my opinion.  I came for lunch with a couple of friends and their kitchen is FAST. I would place orders on things and get them within minutes. They have a really sweet team. I was nervous reading reviews but I got lucky. I ordered the pictured hand roll and it came to me in like under a minute. The appetizers from the kitchen came out hot and fast also. Empty plates were cleared quickly. Orders could be given to anyone and they did ask often. It went swimmingly. No complaints at all.  Their appetizer selection is big enough, but not huge. The items they do have are done well. I tried the age dashi tofu and the pork belly.   The main item IMO aside from the fresh fish would have to be tempura shrimp. Why? That's my favorite item in a sushi roll. I really like their shrimp tempura so although I don't remember which rolls I got I did think they were all good. The fried items came out hot in the rolls while the cold items were cold. That's the most enjoyable types of rolls to me.  My one \"complaint\" is their rolls menu is so huge! Not a real complaint lol It's very intimidating or hard to figure out what to order. I suggest looking at Yelp photos or just reading. We did get recommendations from the server which made this a none issue.  Their nigiri that was served was also really good. They serve large slices of fish on their rice. This was a highlight for me. I was able to try different fish without getting full off of a huge rice to fish ratio.  The restaurant was clean, service was attentive, their food quality was good, and I can't wait to go back. Add the affordable price and Sakana now is up there on my AYCE  sushi list.  Pro tip! I heard a group next to us pay the dinner price to get their dinner specials. I wish I knew this was an option earlier on as I did want to try their oysters and uni along with their other dinner only items.",

We went before noon and we were seated right away. People started to come in after so it became busy. We had 2 servers and they forgot to bring us our appetizer. I saw one of them giving it to the wrong tables and the customers not accepting it, but didn't say a word. We just ended up reordering it again and it did come.  Overall it was good and we ate a lot!

I like how they indicate which ingredients are inside the roll, and which ones are on top of the roll. But honestly, what I liked the most about this place was the quality of sushi received in a very fair amount of time. I went in during dinner service with each table seated. Maybe I got lucky with the sushi crew that night, but I received most of my orders within 6-7 minutes.   The atmosphere is relaxed, but it can get pretty loud in there just due to the amount of people. Worth a shot.",

Afterwards, this is where this place fell short for me. The waitress came and asked us what we wanted to drink, then another guy, and then another guy asked and delivered. Kind of annoying telling 3/4 different people the same exact thing what you want to drink. Then another, different person came to ask us what we wanted to eat. I ordered the \"be happy\" roll and my girlfriend ordered the \"golden California\" and \"Japanese lasagna roll.\" All three orders were very delicious. That's what kept this place at a 3 Star for me because afterwards our menus weren't taken away from us after we ordered, nobody came to check on us/refill our waters. I couldn't help but overhear at the table next to us that they were flagging down somebody because they've been there for quite some time and nobody came over to ask them what they wanted to drink/order. The place just seemed kind of dysfunctional in regards to communication. If you can get past that, then the food is delicious and will leave your stomach happy",

Garlic Ahi & Yuzu Hamachi was ok; the sauce was kind of subdued...Hamachi, ahi, & unagi were delicious. There's a garlic bread appetizer with spicy crab mayo & nori, I think it's called Pago; definitely try it. Bacon wrapped scallops were tiny but good. The selection of appetizers is really extensive which is good for those who aren't big fans of fish. We had couple other things that were good but I mostly stuck with nigiri. Service is friendly & quick. The three of us were in & out of there in just about an hour. This has now become our new favorite AYCE sushi place when in Vegas. I wanted to post pictures but food was so good I couldn't stop eating to snap a pic, haha.",

I'm not sure what happened, either the owner changed or the Chef changed. My family ate here today and we were severely disappointed. The \"deep fried\" parts are soggy, the flavor turned bland and some of the food doesn't even look like itself. My experience? I would say it was like eating with an old friend and finding out he was undergoing surgery to become an Apache Helicopter. An equal mixture of confusion, disappointment and shock. Like forcing your friend to watch that old movie you saw a long time ago that you remember was REALLY good, only to sit there for the next 2 hours listening to your friend sarcastically compliment the \"amazing\" storyline of the whole movie while you silently agree with him in your head because you're too embarrassed to verbally  admit that the movie wasn't as great as you remembered.",

    "text": "I wanted to eat a big meal before going in to a long night shift, so I decided to find an AYCE sushi place near Sunrise Hospital. Sakana wasn't too big of a restaurant, but it was spacious enough and not too crowded mid-afternoon when I visited. The interior decoration felt very sea-themed to me, and after all, \"sakana\" does mean \"fish\" in Japanese.   I opted for the AYCE dinner (dinner is anything after 3PM). The price is reasonable (~$26 before tax), and includes everything on the menu. Some of the more premium items are only available to order as part of AYCE for dinner, and are limited to one order. I also found out when I received my bill that drinks are NOT included (had I known, I would not have ordered both hot tea and lemonade).   Service was efficient and generally friendly. When one of my orders arrived as a roll instead of a hand roll, they remedied the situation without giving me a hard time. They are also very observant and quick to clear finished plates, since all the servers work as a team (I may have had a primary waiter/waitress, but placed orders with multiple people and had sushi brought out by different people as well).  The food was pretty decent for AYCE sushi, and there were definitely some unique items on the menu too. In particular, some of the nigiri cuts were quite big portions of fish, and the rice ball underneath is relatively small. The food came out relatively quickly as well.   There were some Korean dishes on the menu, and Kpop playing on the TVs, so I would safely assume that this restaurant is Korean-owned. Several of the servers and even a few sushi chefs were Latino, so it's a very multicultural staff, haha.  I was struggling at the very end to finish the last few pieces of two rolls, as they charge for leftovers. I was able to finish in the end, though didn't ask if they offer half-sized portions for rolls.  Decent variety of dishes + reasonable price + above average quality = solid AYCE sushi. You can also order a-la-carte if you desire, though if you are hungry, AYCE is definitely much better value.",

Luckily they complied . I'm all about salmon , so I always get salmon lover and always get salmon nigiri . All Asians know that Nigari will get your money's worth.  One of the best sushi places in my opinion. Oh and they have honey toast ! And green tea ice cream Their deals : 2 for 1 sake beer wine soju and flavor sake is pretty awesome because it's everyday when you order all you can eat",

I was the only one in my party who likes raw fish so it was very hard for me to finish it all. I would have much rather ordered different nigiri.  First time trying sweet shrimp and uni. The shrimp was meh- nothing I would crave again. The uni didn't look fresh, I expected it to be a yellowish color but it was more brown. Tasted sweet though and I could get use to it.  My favorite were the trout and salmon belly sashimi.   Service: they only had guys working here, and they seem to work together pretty well.  Only problem was they did forget a couple of items we ordered.  Everything else was great. Attentive, fast.   Only weird part about the whole trip was how many homeless people were around. When we walked in a lady from the parking lot asked for money. Then right around the entrance a guy with a window cleaner wanted to clean our car windows. And while waiting inside another person walked toward the waiting area, reached his hands all the way down his pants and felt around for a few seconds, I thought he was going to pull a guy or knife out and attack us. I think he was align for a cup of water and they were nice enough to give him one. He asked my husband if he wanted to buy these headphones that he grabbed from his pants as he was walking out. While we were eating, about 40 minutes later, same guy came back to get his water cup refilled and looked around the restaurant trying to get eye contact with anyone so he can sell the headphones. It was just a shady experience for someone who is not from Vegas. I wish they were located in a nicer area.",

    "text": "First off, let me say, I'm not even from Vegas.  I'm from California and going Sakana is a MUST when I'm in Vegas.    I'm a huge sushi lover and I've had sushi at many different sushi restaurants.  This is, by far, the best sushi I've had.  I'm normally scared to try new sushi rolls because I'm very picky and usually end up leaving not fully satisfied with the flavor.  However, I've yet to walk away from Sakana unsatisfied.  I've tried about 7 different sushi's there and loved every single one of them.  My favorite would be the 911 sushi roll.  It's the spiciest sushi I've had yet and I can't get enough of it.  To finish off your meal I would recommend the \"Monkey Brain\" sushi.  Tastes like a dessert with some sort of banana filling in the middle.  You'll keep coming back for more ;)  The location where this restaurant is located is a little deceiving.  Its not that pretty or fancy on the outside, but when you walk in, it's completely different.  It's very inviting, dim lights, music in the background with very friendly staff.  Not to mention, the food is served very quickly!!    If your party is more than 5, I would recommend making a reservation.  Enjoy!!! :)",

Make sure you tip those guys if you're at the sushi table! They work hard.  As for quality I was disappointed with everything except for the salmon, Ama ebi, salmon belly, bake muscles and the eel.  We didn't try the specialty rolls since those fills you up too quick. As for ama Ebi, uni, and oysters was not all you can eat. Only one per person.",

The size of the restaurant is pretty small compared to other places but the tables moved quick and me and my girlfriend got seated in under 10 minutes.  Our server was a nice guy, and he took our orders pretty fast.   Location is a bit subpar as the area is rather ghetto by UNLV and the restaurant is kind of tucked away in the corner which made it hard to find initially.   The nigiri is bomb, we got salmon, yellowtail , super white tuna, garlic tuna. All bomb stuff . The only part that I don't like is that the fish to rice ratio is terribly off. Small rice to big cuts of fish.   Would come back here!",

    "text": "9/5: went in on a slow day with a friend from California. We were sat in a booth with was convenient because I had my 3 month old daughter in her car seat. I'm surprised that they are slow in Labor Day. Thought I'd show him one of my favorite sushi spots in Las Vegas. We were assisted as soon as we got in, they took our drink order and food order quickly. I always get nigiri, the fish is so fresh and yummy. I like how their rice under their nigiri is really small, so you can eat more food.   Update: 6/15 So the food here is really good, we all know that. I am just very upset with the customer service tonight. We came and had AYCE, we put in the order as soon as we got in and about half of the food came within 10 minutes of ordering. As we are waiting for the rest of our order, our server does not check up on us at all. Finally I wave down a bus boy and asked to check on the status of the remaining order and he lets me know he will get our server. By this time 25 minutes have passed since we got our food that came out earlier. He then comes and asks if we remember what we ordered and had to put in our order again...... Now it's been 45 minutes without food and everyone else has gotten multiple of their orders. I believe with that happening they should expedite our food first. I am so upset with their service I am literally writing this as I am waiting for our food. I think I will go elsewhere next time.  -------------------------------------------------------  I've been here twice, the first time with my sister and the second time with my boyfriend.  Both times I came here for AYCE sushi dinner. Personally I really like this sushi place, my only suggestion would be for them to do half rolls so that the patrons can try a variety of them instead of getting stuck having to eat one they don't like. Like most AYCE sushi joints, if you do not eat it all you are required to pay for leftovers.   This was a bummer for me because I came here at 11:10 with my sister and they close the kitchen at 11:30, although the restaurant closes at midnight. They told us that we needed to complete our order after putting it in at once. I left my sister in charge of ordering since I've never been here and she obviously ordered more than we could eat. So we ended up paying the difference for two regular rolls.   Overall, I enjoy their selection of nigiri and rolls alongside dessert! You can't beat that!  You must get their honey toast, salmon belly nigiri, Amaebi, sashimi tower, and garlic ahi nigiri!    I still have to try the rest of their rolls but for the most part I enjoyed everything I ordered!!",

You can order half rolls unless its a roll with softshell crab or a baked roll. The portions are huge!  2. The honey toast dessert is a Hawaiian roll with honey and vanilla ice cream on top--you can make this shit at home!   3. Desserts are not unlimited..only ice cream  4. Salmon Kama is not as large as the one at Goyemon.  5. Hamachi Kama are large at yama sushi.  Overall service was good, the server was attentive, food was delish, we will come back!   The only negative comment I have is that they should hire a host!",

Yum yum is deep fried - had high expectations but my dislike of fried got the better of me. My pieces just fell apart but overall not too bad. The dragon was my favorite roll of the ones we ordered. We wanted to try the jackpot (recommend by our sushi guy) but we were stuffed!!! Oh and best for last - the TNT!!!! It's baked with EVERTHYING AWESOMENESS! Scallops, lobster, mussels...DO GET!!

All the sauces and garnishes were perfecto! What really caught my eye was the small detail that they offer trout on AYCE(one order per person). I haven't seen that anywhere. Matter of fact they had so many options I don't see anywhere else such as tiramisu, honey toast, lobster(though miniscule portions) and so on.   The waitress was a bit aloof since she walked by a couple times smiling after seating us but never stopping to take an order within 15 mins. There were a couple raised eyebrow moments from her besides that. Had to wave down another person and he was surprised no one had helped us. But from then on service was good.   Needless to say, I'll be returning. No question about it.",

We came in the first time decided to just order individual rolls instead of the AYCE, which was a big mistake! After trying a few rolls we wish we had did the AYCE for $25.95. The rolls were so good especially the baked lobsters roll, we decided to come back the next day to do AYCE. I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Vegas although the it's off the strip. Only bad thing I have to say about Sakana is their desserts sucks... But I'm there for sushi.   Service was great!  No wait time both time we came   Price was average for AYCE",

    "text": "It's a busy place located in a strip mall away from the strip.  But it is AYCE.  AYCE sushi places are few in Southern California.  This place is Korean owned.  I am part Korean and Japanese and I can tell when people speak either or.  I don't care if sushi places are Korean owned as long as it tastes fresh and their sushi rice is good. Upon entrance the owner with the short hair was curt but she seemed efficient in getting people seated. You have to sign your name and the number of people in your party on the clipboard and wait until your name is called.   Once seated, it took too long to get menus. Our server was female and although she was quick at getting our order, there was a hidden annoyance I could detect throughout our entire meal. I never felt comfortable ordering through her.  She wasn't friendly.  Everyone else helping her out with our table was friendly though.  I did like how quickly everything was delivered and dirty dishes picked up from our table quickly.   I did not like their ama ebi (sweet shrimp). It had the most disgusting, slimy texture and the fried heads tasted off.  I usually love the stuff but I couldn't finish the fried heads here.  They limit your order to one piece.  Thank goodness I didn't get sick from it.    I really loved their seafood salad, super white fish sushi and garlic tuna sushi.  This place also includes dessert into their fixed all you can eat price.  Not a bad option for $26 if you're in the area and really hungry.  It's a good sign when place is busy, high turnover with the fish.  You want that when you're eating raw fish.",

Others were either doused in sauce or simply limited-- as in we could only order one portion per person. The salmon belly was good,   and the sweet raw shrimp was really delicious. I did love how the shrimp came with a fried head-- the best! But the rest of the nigiri was unimpressive. There was a lot of rice in both of the nigiri and the rolls, so it fills you up really quick. I ordered a premium roll with spicy tuna, but they covered it with too much sweet sauce, so it threw off the balance of flavors complete. I did order another one of the same roll, but asked for less sauce, which actually helped.  To be honest, the only reason we tried this place was because Goyemon had a 2 hour wait, and we were starving! I'd much rather wait for two hours at Goyemon instead.",

    "text": "Alright, after dining here a bunch of times, I'm finally writing a review!!!  This has got to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot. Plus it's only $22.95 for dinner!! Good price compared to other sushi spots around town. You know that feeling when after a few rolls of sushi that they all start tasting the same? Not here. They prepare each roll carefully and take pride in it. Our waitress, Sunny, (spelling?) has always been awesome. She's quick and efficient and always so friendly to us.   They have a good variety of appetizers and rolls. I'm not going to go over every food item, but here are a few things I always order:  Sashimi roll: all the fish wrapped in cucumber instead of rice with a special sauce. So yummy, healthy and delicious.   Salmon skin hand roll: they don't skimp on the salmon skin. The salmon skin is cooked perfectly and crispy. Not too much rice either.    Nigiri (garlic tuna, salmon, salmon belly, squid): most places take a huge ball of rice and put it under a small piece of fish. The portion of rice is small compared to the amount of fish. So you actually taste the fish instead of all the rice.   The only reason why I docked a star is because they got rid of the specials menu, which had tobiko and toro on it. We asked why it was gone and Sunny said that people were too picky and didn't like it. Wtf?! How could you NOT like it? Those were my favorite two things to order!!! I was pretty sad and felt like I was jipped of my Sakana experience. I'll still come here though. :)  P.S. It's unlimited dessert too!!!!",

    "text": "Tried the ayce a 3rd time and it is hands-down one of the best values for sushi in las vegas.    Even during lunch, just pay $2 more and you get a plethora of dinner options as seen in my photos which include a sashimi roll which is practically rolls using sashimi as the wrap, screaming O salad, and my absolute favorite here: the towering poke stack.    Sakana offers a great amount of appetizers which vary and include fried rice, pork belly, gyoza, shrimp tempura, also something called \"the shit\"  which was just okay.   The fact that they are AYCE does not sacrifice the quality of the sushi here.  Super fresh, super delicious.  Still way cheaper than any other ayce in Vegas.  On their dinner specials this time around: \"Sy's Special and Dragon's Special\" .  These referred to the two sushi chef's who each made unique dishes.     I tried the Dragon special and out came salmon belly nigiri plated next to a sushi 'ball' wrapped in avocado and sushi.  Hard to describe but delicious, just check out my picture of this.  Later during the dinner, SY offered his special to us.  He asked me to try it and since I didn't technically order it, they said if I didn't finish it, it wouldn't count against us.  (Since you're supposed to finish everything you order).  A whole different sushi preparation compared to Dragon's and picture must be seen below.  Of course, like the Dinner Special board had written down \"Don't ask, just try!\"  that is exactly what I did.  It was pretty good, dragon's was better imo.  The only 1 reason I took down a star this time around:  I ordered 1 piece of Uni which is a dinner only item.  They ran out!   Now, If I came late to dinner that would be fine, but we were the first customers there for dinner.   I guess being able to have the \"dinner\" menu during lunch time is a double-edged sword.  It's great, because I would come during lunch and do dinner, but I believe you should save some uni for your real dinner time customers.  I have tried their uni in the past times I've ate here, and it was fresh.  Creamy and tasty.  The service is always nice here.  The location is right on the corner behind the Target.  They finally have their Sakana sign up after having the old Kabuto sign which they replaced.    If you're craving sushi, and lots of it, and you don't want the quality of your sushi sacrificed, come to Sakana!",

    "text": "I would absolutely give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for one thing: terrible service from Ron.  This place has been a favorite of mine since I discovered it about 8 months ago. The sushi is off the charts delicious and the price can't be beat. It's gotten busier since and things have slowed down a bit due to lack of employees but the food has always been worth dealing with the not so fast service.   That all changed today when Ron was waiting on my family and I. Service was beyond slow so we front loaded our order and ordered 8 rolls for the 3 of us. Ron started off with a backhanded comment on how that was a lot. But we went through with it because we knew it would all be eaten.   Time passed and people who were seated after us were getting their orders while others were getting multiple orders at a time. About 45 minutes passed with no sushi and we asked Ron to check on our order. His response was \"you ordered 9 rolls\". His comment was rude enough, but his gruff tone and poor attitude was really what set me off. There were many things that could have been handled better by Ron, but his poor service and bad attitude may have turned us away from our favorite sushi place in Vegas.  Step up Sakana.",

I had my Uncle visiting town so I wanted to show him this restaurant because it was one of my favorites.  First when we got there, the lady that was seating people didn't look too happy to be there. When she was seating parties, she skipped our name on the list and then pretended that she didn't. There were lots of open tables and still made excuses as to why we had to wait.   We finally got seated and service was fine from then on. But the next day, my Uncle and I both got extremely sick. I had food poisoning and was sick all day. His wasn't nearly as bad as mine was but he was still feeling sick too.   After this experience, I will never be returning here. Be careful if you choose to eat here!!",

Overall the food is 5 star for AYCE quality.  Cons: service. It was only my friend and I eating here so we didn't want to order too much fear that we might not finish all. So we order little at a time. Also cuz we want to try different selections. The menu also suggest not to over over it. HOWEVER, there's this server who is super rude. He gave us an annoyed look and ask are you sure that's all you want to order. We said yes for the first time. The second time he straight up said can you order more? (We already did) . He said he need to run around . How dare he give customer attitude and demand customers what to do. We were full at our third round and we don't have the mood for any dessert.   Overall, if not of his service I would come back. But not this case. To me service is equally important as the quality of the food.",

You can see paint drippings and obvious mistakes the painter has made. The women's bathroom is disgusting. I could take a spoon and scrape off the grime that has accumulated on the walls. I'm sure the muggy humidity doesn't help with that. It's an alright location but it gets beat by the sun and since the doors are always opening and closing, it never really cools down inside thus, leaving it very hot and humid. The service was pretty good- nothing great nor bad. The rolls were splendid and I would eat them again. Problem is, I never want to step foot inside of the restaurant again due to the above reasons.  Anyways, if you don't mind a dirty bathroom and eating in what is, basically a sauna, this place will be perfect for you!",

My husband is very selective about sushi places because of fishy odor and food that are not being fresh, BUT Sakana stunned my husband and me. We tried all-you-can-eat. This selection is a go-to option because you can try all sorts of rolls and Nigiri and pricing is better than ordering each roll if you're planning to eat a lot. Every rolls and Nigiri was savory, but one of the recommendations are: shrimp tempura, from sushi: Squid, super white tuna, ocean trout, and Cajun tuna, Hawaiian roll. I give a thumbs-up for Sakana!!!",

The nigiri pieces are generous, and it is fresh. They even offer a few yakitori items which are worth trying as well. However, in my personal opinion, the True gem of Sakana are their appetizers. They are not messing around with The Shit (imagine a deep fried dynamite) and Pang (lobster mix, salmon and sauce baked on garlic bread); we literally got 4 rounds of Pang, and it still to this day haunts my dreams because I can't have it in my mouth this very moment. I can't recommend this place enough for anyone who enjoys sushi and is within traveling distance. I would rate it as an equivalent of 2 Michelin stars, worthy of a detour.",

I'm very stingy because tips was already including in my AYCE bull since we had a party of 6 so instead of $25.99+tax there was a $5.65 charge for tip AND I DONT TIP WITH CHANGE I ROUND UP! But that's okay too. They were very attentive with my group especially since we had 2 people who weren't all you can eat. The awesome thing about this sushi place is they have a specific menu that offered one item per person but they were pretty good options. I chose the sushi donut which was Instagram worthy. The cuts in the salmon and tuna were absolutely delicious! Their rolls are very different and each roll was pretty unique! They're not just California rolls or spicy California rolls with toppings but the inside options of every roll is unique in a sense that they have different content. It's hard to describe but just check out the menu! The menu is massive! We didn't even know there was a backside.  They have a large variety of foods, they definitely section off their menu too from appetizers, bakes rolls, spicy rolls, etc. I'll definitely come back to this sushi joint whenever we're back in Vegas!",

    "text": "Update!!!!!!! Food great! Manager is the worst! I want to give this place a great rating however due to recent experience I just can't get myself to give it more than a star...cuz the food is good...I understand that it was very busy...I don't mind orders being late and at times the orders being wrong I can live...I don't even know where the order went wrong but apparently we didn't get what we ordered and some of the food we did order we got wrong portions of it...the waiters and waitresses I never have had a problem with they were apologetic about orders being wrong and food being late and for the wait...we asked the waiter about our orders and that we haven't received them so he went to check on them...the manager came by and took the wrong orders that came to our table and she was super rude to start with and told the waiter not to take our orders...she apparently assumed that the waiter made mistakes taking our order but if that was the case and she told him not to take our order than she should have sent us an server to take our order or taken our order herself...her prideful ass is nowhere to be seen for like he next 30 mins and when she does show up and not even to our table I ask her can u get us a server we would like to order with someone cuz u took our server from us...so she said ok didn't send anyone to us and our old server comes to check on us like a good server to see if needed something and he decided to take our order cuz we waited so long to be served..he took our order and when the order did arrive wrong amount of food comes out...we are confused and I was like uh we didn't order this much and oh she shows her ugly face and tells us well that what u ordered...how the hell does she know what we order...she didn't even take our order...first of all we were being as understanding as hell to help lighten the load off the chaos and she has the nerve to tell us not to order the food like that...I mean did she take our order...how the hell does she know what we ordered how much we ordered...got the nerves to tell how to order the food we gonna eat...she she for realz...feel bad for the servers there tonight and for the guest that has to deal with her and her rude and snobby prideful ass...I wouldn't be surprised if there are more terrible reviews like this today...food is great the waiters r coo....I for one will not return as long as she is there...that ain't the only sushi place in town...that manager is terrible got to go back to the basics and learn guest services...the waiters got better customer service than the manager",

I think the portions have gotten smaller since last year. We waited so long for a 5 person table that I though the food was going to be really good . The service was no good.  No one attended to us, we would always have to call someone from across the room. The atmosphere was good. I recommend the \"what the heck\" roll. -Bay Area transplant",

    "text": "After all those rave reviews on Sakana, I requested for hubby and I to have dinner here, on a Friday evening.  When we arrived, it wasn't busy whatsoever, so we sat on the other side, which was separated by plants etc.  However, it was 10 minutes before the male server realized that he had customers sitting on that side.    He then took our drink order and though I was ready to place my order, he said he will be right back since another couple arrived.  Service was SLLLLOOOWWW.  It feels as if though they are short on servers.  When he finally came back to ask for our order, of course I order uni, amaebi, then he stop me and said, \"We ran out of uni and amaebi. Let me go check.\"  Then he disappeared for a while.  When he came back, he handed us a sheet to order from and verified that they do not have uni and amaebi to order.  So I ordered items on the special menu (toro steak, salmon belly, white fish), saba, superwhite, salmon, scallops, salmon kama.  Server came back to let us know that they are out of salmon kama, how about Hamachi kama.  We said yeah that's cool.  He left and returned to let us know that they are also out of hamachi kama.  For the items that we did order, the only thing that tasted good was the salmon belly and toro steak.  Other items were doused with too much sesame oil, tasteless, or downright odd (the scallops tasted like they were previously cooked).  So at this point, I had given up on order anything else since I do not want to stuff myself with mediocre sushi.  Earl however, is eating for sustenance.    We never, ever, order sushi rolls at AYCE.  But this night, Earl did.  He eat, just to eat.  We overheard another table said that they couldn't order chicken fried rice because they are out of it.  How they heck do you run out of chicken fried rice when your restaurant isn't even that busy?  We learned from another yelper that visited Sakana earlier that a health inspector came by earlier and service slowed down a lot.  Guess that explains some parts to the evening, but what about mediocre sushi?  Conclusion:  Goyemon is still the best.  We will not return to Sakana.",

I thoroughly recommend the unagi nigiri that is hand torched, crispy to perfection.   The dragon ballz (pause) were an awesome surprise as well. ( deepfried mushrooms stuffed with crab and mayo). And for dessert, the mini honey toast was clever and delicious! They use a cube of hawaiian bread! For the price, you get so much value. I cant say it enough. This place is totally worth the price/wait/drive/inconvenience to go to. Literally nothing I ordered and ate was lack-luster... and I ate a ton.",

The fish is fresh and the sauces are bangin'   For just $25 per person for dinner, I left feeling that I had  a $75 per person omakase.  The highlights of our meal were the Chanel roll and the Towering Sashimi Poke (must try!).  We need a Sakana on the West side of town!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went with a large group of friends there was a total of 12 I believe. Everyone got all you eat except for me. I'm allergic to a lot of fish so rather than chance it I just got a few things other than sushi. The staff was not friendly at all they didn't really say much and weren't very helpful. They dropped a piece of paper for the AYCE people to fill out which was kind of hard with 12 people and one paper. They took drink orders and appetizer orders and that was all we really saw of our waiter. He refilled our water only once after having to ask multiple times. Once the food was out everything was alright. I had ordered the teriyaki chicken which wasn't very flavorful and dry. I also order the bacon wrapped asparagus which was also dry and very chewy I couldn't even eat it and I ordered the vegetable fried rice which was pretty good nothing really wrong with it but it was nothing spectacular either. Everyone who got sushi didn't really have many complaints. The one thing that was very uncomfortable was how all of the staff watched us like a hawk to make sure all the sushi was eaten because whatever wasn't eaten would be charged for. The waiter came back and took dessert orders. I had the fried banana which was probably the best thing I had ate all night but it still wasn't great. When the waiter brought our bill he charged my boyfriend and for 2 AYCE even tho I didn't do AYCE we brought it up and he fixed it although wasn't very nice about it. Everyone had paid and there was still a plate of sushi (someone in our group didn't finish) when another staff member came over and asked about it our friend told him we had already paid and he got mad and said we should've been charged but he was mad at us like it was our fault we weren't charged. Very unprofessional and awkward. The place was alright but nothing out of this world like everyone has said. My boyfriend thought the sushi was pretty good but has had better. Overall I wouldn't return.",

    "text": "Went back here on a Friday night for ayce dinner ($22.99).  If I thought lunch here was already outstanding, dinner kicked it up a couple of notches higher!  Aside from more menu items being available during dinner, the mood and ambiance of this restaurant is way nicer.  The place was nearly full of people, the sushi chefs were having fun, and there's just this atmosphere perfect for unwinding after a long work week.  Being my second time here, I can say that the food quality and presentation has improved.  I don't know if food is just deliberately more elaborately prepared during dinner service or if it was a planned improvement altogether.  We sampled most of the dinner-only items and the stand outs to me are the sashimi salad, screaming-o, sashimi roll, and the towering poke.  Heck, everything we ordered was fantastic!  One thing I should mention is that while service did seem to lag a bit during Sakana's peak occupancy while we were there, I can tell that it's definitely not due to lack of effort or enthusiasm of the kitchen and wait staff.  Our servers had a great attitude even when things were frantic.  Overall, our food was delivered just as fast as we can eat them and our glasses not empty for very long.  Sakana is definitely legit and is a must try for ayce sushi addicts.",

We ordered: baked mussels, red snapper, salmon, salmon belly, yellowtail, mackerel, super white tuna, sweet shrimp, the shit, ocean trout and the sarada lobster. There were a few other items including the honey toast and the grey pudding stuff. The only thing I was disappointed with was the oysters but it's expected.

This one in Vegas was very memorable.  Located in a strip mall about a mile or so off the Las Vegas Strip, Sakana would be your go to as a Vegas local. The menu is very large with many choices outside of your normal AYCE menu. The ingredients are very fresh and you'll find just about anything you can think of on the menu.   You can order as you go, the amounts are not limited to 3 or 4 rounds of ordering like many other AYCE places. This is a huge plus for me!  The reason for 4 stars, this place is used to its locals and regulars who mostly know what they want as soon as they sit down. Because of this the service can sometimes feel rushed. We had to ask for more time to check out the menu. While this is probably isn't a problem for regulars, If you're a visitor it may be overwhelming.  Garlic Tuna Nigiri = Favorite Item",

My first visit was 8/29 and I  wish I discovered this place sooner because this beats all the lunch buffets in the hotels on the strip. .. of course assuming you're looking for sushi :)   I had their salmon, hamachi, saba nigiri and were all good since we were nowhere near an ocean haha. It sucks that their salmon belly, ama ebi, and oyster were dinner only and limited to 1 order per customer.  Quick service, would definitely leave the strip for this restaurant again.",

Love that they don't pack on the rice in the nigiris, rolls, and even hand rolls. Score! Fish was decent quality, nothing to complain about.   Service was great! Fast and efficient. Would definitely recommend coming if you're in town and looking to get your fill of sushi.",

Coming from someone who has dined throughout various AYCE sushi joints in So Cal, this place definitely serves fresh quality fish that is fresher than some So Cal joints. Service here is pretty speedy and it's a bit different here for how you put in your orders. Instead of using a piece of paper to order what you want for three rounds in So Cal, you just simply tell the server what'd you like and you can order again when they come around.   As for the fish to rice ratio, this place serves up a bit more rice than what we're used to in So Cal, but the slice of fish is also much fatter than in So Cal.  Recommended nigiri picks here:  Tuna Yellowtail Salmon Salmon belly(toro) Freshwater eel Uni(fresh) Ama ebi(very fresh)  Definitely a great spot for AYCE sushi when in Vegas!",

    "text": "I was in the area for a conference and tried the following during my lunch AYCE sushi experience:  Appetizers: -Gyoza: I typically prefer pan-fried Gyoza, but in terms of fried Gyoza goes, this definitely tastes better than most fried ones I tried at other places. Crispy yet thin wrap. Good stuffing inside too. I especially love the sauce that goes with the Gyoza. I loved it so much that I used it for dipping sauce for other stuff I ordered.  -Don Katsu Curry: Not a fan. Doesn't have much flavor.   Soup & Salad: -House Salad: It's ok. I was craving for veges,  but kinda regretted wasting my stomach on the house salad. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but with all the other amazing options on the menu, not worth the precious room in my stomach  Nigiri (just right amount of rice, not like some other restaurants with mostly rice tiny bit of fish):  -Ocean trout: Amazing! Must try!  -Tamago (sweet egg): Good -Mackeral: Amazing! Must try!  -Fresh Water Eel: Good -Sarada Lobster: Not a fan! It's crushed lobster salad with creamy sauce. I was looking forward to more like a chunks of lobster tail...  Hand Roll:  -300 (Spicy): Amazing! Must try! All the fish is in big chunks. Very frsh. Tiny bit of sauce to give that extra kick without overpowering the freshness of the fish. Just the right amount of rice.   Skewer:  - Schrimp: doesn't look too good, tastes pretty good.   Dessert: -Afforgato (Vanilla Ice Cream with Korean Style Coffee): I was a bit disappointed with the presentation when it came out, but it actually tasted very decent! Not what I expected, but not bad.   Overrall: Excellent great food and freshly made to order but they come out pretty fast. Service is ok but fast. You can tell they are busy, so I get it. I went there for lunch $20.95. Definitely worth it in my opinion.",

To think that we were so hungry and we were going to settle for Sake Rok bc we didn't want to make that 15 min drive from our hotel was going to be the biggest mistake of our lives lol. Me and my group of friends was so glad that we changed our minds bc this restaurant was ridiculously amazing!!   Upon entering, this place was packed with business so you alr know it's going to be good. We were waitlisted for about 10-15 mins which wasn't so bad. This place is like no other AYCE sushi restaurants bc the slices of fish and the ratio of the rice for their nigiri was perfect. Yall know how certain restaurants like to skimp out on the fish and pack it with so much rice? Lol this place did not do that and I hope it stays the way it is.  Just a heads up, there is an 18% gratuity for a party of 6 or more. THIS PLACE WAS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR, I WILL BE BACK.",

The staff is great, the food is amazing and the value for the price is also good.     It was a dark and stormy night...  just kidding.  I'm in Vegas. It was a hot night as is always the case and it's been a long time since I've been here.   So a friend and I decided to check it out again.   The last time we came they had just sat a party of 37 so it would be a very long wait which meant we went elsewhere that night.   Tonight would be different.     We walked in and were shown a table immediately.  After perusing the menu I ordered a couple of rolls and some nigiri.    The garlic tuna had many delicious flavors dancing in my mouth.  The Call 911 roll had a good spice flavor that was an adventure for my mouth..   The Burning My Ass Roll was good but not too spicy, I was going for more of a kick.   The Little Tease Roll was an amazing combination of flavors.     Everything I had was amazing and it is easy to see why it's always so crowded.   Wait times for rolls was minimal and my water was never empty.     If you're looking for a great spot on the east side just a little distance from the strip you should try your luck with Sakana.  You might hit the jackpot.",

Everything is fresh made so if you get a roll with soft shell crab or tempura ur actually has a crunch! Pork belly was tender and fabulous, shumai and gyoza deep fried and very forgettable.  Lunch for $21 but you won't get the primo fish so come for dinner for $26 if you want the fish belly selections.  30m after lunch open there is a long line outside.

Things to keep in mind: - $25 for an everything on the menu buffet. - You gotta finish urrrythang on your plate. - There will be a wait. - 90-minute time limit.  My crew (whose weight ranges from 170lbs - 240lbs) ordered like 40 plates to share.  We kill't it all.  Not one roll was left on any of the plates.  Nope.    Nada.",

We are self proclaimed sushi snobs from LA where phenomenal sushi abounds. All you can eat isn't our thing...but this was a pleasant surprise.  Some \"must get\" are the white tuna sushi and the lemon salmon. Quite honestly everything was tasty. As others mentioned the rice to fish ratio is very good and you get tons of fish. Rolls are huge and tasty, service great and $20.95 for lunch is shocking. Tip: to avoid long wait times which we hear can be outrageous, come for lunch right as they open at 11:30 or shortly after. Elastic waste-band helps too... wink wink.",

There was a table for 4-6 right next to us that was clean, set & ready to go in addition to a table for 4 across from us & space at the sushi bar.   The server's don't know their own menu, which is annoying. For example, there are 2 flavors of sake listed on the menu: asian pear & \"dragon something\" (can't remember the exact name). I asked what \"dragon something\" was (dragon fruit maybe?) & the answer was \"I dunno.\" The sushi takes forever to come out, the table next to us got some of our food & vice versa,  they simply forgot to bring food, & forget about making a speedy exit cause it took us at least 20 minutes to get the check after asking for it 3 times. To 3 different waiters. Ridiculous.   Food is ok but they need to get it together!",

Perhaps not the most friendliest of staff but they were great at getting food to me efficiently. With the slightly pricier dinner, you get single orders of a couple of exclusive items like sashimi salad and uni nigiri for example. They were of of the latter the night I went but I still had my fill on a variety of fresh nigiri. I thought the ratio of fish to rice was surprisingly decent. Also tried their highly recommended \"The Shit\" appetizer and it was alright but fans of deep fried items dipped in sweet creamy sauces might like this a lot. Loved the sashimi salad with all the big chunks of fresh fish in a bright dressing.   In the end, I enjoyed the items that I really wanted to eat and nothing else. Glad I ventured out to satisfy my tourists' gluttony.",

Please note, if you come for lunch (11:30-3:00pm - $21) it does not include the following: Uni, Ama Ebi, Salmon Belly, Oyster, Sashimi Tower, Seafood Salad, Sashimi Foll, Stuff Tomato, and Q roll). In fact, I am kind of bummed because I reallllllly wanted the Uni and Ama Ebi   We also ordered some of the recommended appetizers: The Shit, Pang, and Pa Fried Chicken. I honestly don't care for any of these three. I would pass on these fried food and just order the nigiri.   SERVICE: - The servers are friendly and at tentative.come  - They don't have a paper slip where you check off the items you want. Instead, the workers come and manually takes your order with unlimited rounds. - We dined here on a Saturday afternoon (2pm), about 10-15 minutes wait.  TIPS: - Come for dinner if you want Uni and the above sushi at 3:00-midnight for $26. - Save your tummy and skip out on the appetizers esp the ones that's highlighted in red (The Shit, Pang, and Pa Fried Chicken).  - Drinks are 2 for 1. We got to 2 draft Asahi 16oz for $6 (pretty good).   - The hand you their menu as well as a Yelp Review 'menu' to encourage you to write a Yelp review to receive a free small bottle of Sapparo, small sake or Soda. I didn't participate in it, just wanted to give my two cents for my dining experience.",

I did the all you can eat sushi & they messed up 2 rolls I ordered, so I basically paid for all you can eat just for one roll & fried rice & dessert .... also they make you pay for coke refills , they give you coke from a can & charge you $1.50! So just bring your own cans of coke... the server admitted to messing up the orders & did nothing to resolve the issue ... just admitted that it was wrong, this was my second time coming to this sushi spot ... the first time I came I had no issues which is why I thought it was a good idea to return. Over all I'm super disappointed this time around.",

Service is friendly and consistent. Rolls are really tasty and fresh. Tried the 49ers roll, Playboy, and Salmon Lover rolls which were all delicious. Definitely would come back and would recommend to friends. Located adjacent to the SAS shoe store in the corner (was a bit of a challenge to find).",

I'm not going to pay sushi prices to get full off rice! This place does not jip you. One of the best AYCE sushi in Vegas! Definitely a favorite of mine!  Parking is never a problem :) Music is at a good volume. Decor is nice and cozy, yet welcoming. They are quick to get plates out of your way. We were quick to get to our table when we got in, and greeted out as we were leaving.",

My friend picked this spot for our girls night dinner, and I'm so happy we went. Alcohol was BoGo free. AYCE dinner was about $25+ (similar price to other AYCE sushi joints in the city).   I love that we're able to order half orders on rolls. Tiger roll is my go-to, and I've had so many different ones all over Vegas and Cali, I'd have to say Sakana's version is the best.   Their Sake Nigiri was so fresh and generously prepared. Amaebi with the fried head was amazing!! Everything else I ordered, I remember being so fresh and delicious.   Mind you, it's a mission for me to get there since I live in the Southwest, but I'll be back!!!",

Huge upcharge when my girlfriend and I both ordered conservatively. Of course when our meal was over our server was gone and we were left with a big tab for ayce when neither of us ordered or wanted all you can eat!   Even worse, for ayce, our service was atrocious! Asked if we wanted anything else once, forgot to give us ginger or wasabi, etc!   Honestly will avoid in the future! Feels a lot like being stolen from when you're charged for all you can eat without ordering it or giving any indication of it! Zero stars. Very negative experience.   Would not recommend.",

It was quite packed, but we got seated right away!  The restaurant is pretty small compared to Sushi Neko, with the same ayce menu and the same type of quirky and dim ambience. You're table is quite close to others, but I was totally fine with that.  The busperson and our main server was very very attentive and quick considering how busy it was.  We got our rolls ordered fast and it was awesome!   I definitely recommend this place- because if they're that attentive asking if we'd like to order anything else constantly, and the rolls were coming in that fast on a BUSY time for DINNER.. Imagine any other time.  I also think this is the 'cheapest' ayce for dinner if I'm not mistaken. $25 ( $28 after tax ). About a dollar off or so than othe dinner pricing I guess.    Oh and they definitely put a generous fish chunk with a little rice ratio for nigiri's, just like Sushi Neko.  Thanks Sakana!",

Our large party decided to take a chance even if we had to split up. I put in 3 names for parties of 7, 7, & 6. I let them know we were willing to split up in any number of ways as long as they could accommodate us. There were tables opening up & they mentioned they would try to seat us together. After waiting about 30 mins, the staff was able to put tables together so we could sit together as a team. The staff was great in accommodating us! Everything was delicious & the staff was very friendly. We'll definitely go back when we come out to Vegas!!!",

This time around we stocked up on the nigiri: Garlic Tuna, Albacore, Cajun Tuna, Octopus, Surf Clam, Sarada Lobster, and Ocean Trout. All delicious.  This place still apparently has some of the absolute best Surf Clam. They use nice portions for all the seafood.  The Salmon Skin Roll is excellent, just saying.  Full Moon Roll is still one of the best here. The Japanese Lasagna was good, not amazing.  Towering Sashimi Poki is still really great, and only comparable to Sushi Doh's \"Nacho Daddy\".  Seafood Salad is decent. I actually preferred the cucumber out of it. The Bulgogi Nacho is tasty, and different all around.  Green Tea Panna Cotta for dessert, a nice touch.  I would definitely come here a 3rd time. I'd also recommend giving this place a try if you haven't.  Service is still very good too! :)",

    "text": "Stopped by this place on a Sunday night. The first thing that strikes me about the place is the decor. It has an identity crisis. Part of it looks like a normal sushi restaurant and then there's a wall that looks like a real life Pinterest board. Just wooden arts and crafts and etched sayings and such. It seemed out of place.   There were a ton of servers working but it seemed that it didn't lead to great communication. We were asked a few times by one server about ordering and then asked again by another server. I'll take this though over having no one talk. Having too many people trying to take your order is a  good problem to have.   For the food, I got a hand rolled tuna roll. It wasn't great, and for the price is disappointing. Though, we had a tray of their special roll of the day and that was pretty tasty.   Remember how they were so many people taking our order? None wanted to take our money. That's always the thing that boggles my mind about restaurants. I want to pay for services and it's hard to flag someone down. That was a bummer. Plus, some of the seating is hard wood blocks. Probably a Pinterest craft but it should be more for decoration as it did not make my posterior feel good.   It's definitely a quirky place and it's worth a shot, just get a regular seat.",

The menu is extensive and amazing - hands down the best I've ever seen. The service is outstanding; Hambee was our waitress and she was super fast and very attentive. The sushi itself was phenomenal and the best I've ever had - my only complaint is that my stomach wasn't big enough to try everything on the menu! We love all-you-can-eat sushi and couldn't recommend this place more.",

As soon as we sat down, everything was great! the service was super friendly and the food came out fast. It's not like some of the ayce sushi places where they don't check on you anymore after a large order lol the server was constantly checking on us and the bussers/runners were always refilling our drinks and taking our dishes. The fish for the nigiri is cut thicker and bigger than everywhere else. If you don't like a lot of rice this place is for you. I prefer my fish cut thinner but it was really fresh and delicious so I didn't mind the thicker cut. The rolls are also bigger here, make sure to ask for half rolls so you can try a lot. For appetizer, the shit is a must but the pang is so so, it had too much mayo. Oh yeah the mayo! They're kinda heavy on the mayo here so read the description of the rolls if you're not up for that kind of richness lol like the monkey brains had a LOT of mayo. That with the mushy bananas was definitely not one of our favorite rolls lol we finished our meal with a great green tea panna cotta and the mini honey toast. We also tried their ice creams. Great way to end our meal!",

We bring all of our guests here when they come to visit.  The A-Y-C-E is an awesome deal at about $25 for dinner.  I usually get mine a-la-carte now.

Lunch price for All You Can Eat is amazing but spending a few more dollars for dinners so worth it and still pretty reasonable for all you can eat.

I was with a group and decided to just suck it up and buy in since I was the only one at the table with reservations about it.  I was more than pleasantly surprised with the variety on the menu and even more ecstatic when our waiter told us that desserts were included! I love Mochi and the coffee Mochi was Delish!  The fish was extremely fresh and cut thick. The rolls were big and they weren't cheap or skimpy on the amount of fish and shellfish that built each dish.   The 'Burning Your Ass' roll, 'Lemon Salmon' roll and The 'Johnny' roll were a crowd favorite.  The only thing I'd change is the sauce on a couple of the rolls. Some were a little too soaked which made them a difficult to eat and over powered the dish.   The restaurant was clean and the decor was modern and fun! The walls are covered with cool art, big chalk boards with colorful chalk and a plank wood tree climbing up one of the walls into the ceiling. Did I mention Hello Kitty was the decor in the women's restroom? Any girl would love that. It has an all around Japanese Hipster feel. It was right up my alley!   The staff was friendly and our waiter was patient with our big party. I will definitely be going back every time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Service was curt but at least they did not forget any of our order, which happens often at AYCE. They push several appetizers on their menu as \"must try\" - I tried to ask what was in the Pang and The Shit but not only did the waiter not answer me, he put them into our order and we were forced to eat (or pay extra for without eating) both apps which turned out to be all fake crab. I was just asking about them, NOT ordering them!  Nearly every roll has fake crab in it. Ordered the King Lobster roll because it did not list crab as an ingredient, but not only did it have crab, it did not have lobster. Even with asking for sauces on the side, the rolls were also all sweet so we gave up on them after a while and concentrated on nigiri.  Nigiri was okay though the rice ratio is off. A lot of people like it this way but it is far from authentic. With the long slice of fish leaving a tail that hangs off the little round ball of rice, they look like sperm. (I did notice that the more we ordered the bigger the balls of rice became, but that could have been a coincidence.) The salmon was the best fish they had. The super white tuna (ono) was both pretty good too. Unagi and yellowtail were fine, nothing special. Tuna and albacore were so-so. Ocean trout was stringy. We liked the two seared salmon items, but the garlic tuna and the 300 albacore tasted too similar. We were here for lunch so did not get the dinner-only salmon belly, oyster, uni or amaebi.  Mini udon was good - the broth was a little on the sweet side, but the noodles were nice and chewy, not overcooked at all.  Agedashi tofu was okay. Flavor profile of the sauce was off and the breading was a little too thick for agedashi.  I'm not usually much of a sweets person but the dessert may have been the best part. Both the green tea panna cotta and the black sesame blanc mange were very firm and not too sweet. Both had developed a skin on top, so if you like pudding skin you'll like this. I don't know if they changed the policy since that other guy's review where he was able to order unlimited desserts, but we were only allowed one per person.  Unlimited refills on $1.50 iced tea. They have regular and green, and both can be unsweetened.  I didn't see any signs about the free drink with review. All I saw was a sign saying they could only split bills into 6 checks per group.  The ladies' room was painted in fake Hello Kitties all over the walls. They were obviously amateur but not bad considering it was done freehand. And there was a lamp that looked like it was from Ikea - the nearest Ikea to Vegas is in West Covina, CA - my local back in LA!  They played a lot of Korean music videos, including 3 different Psy songs. They also played a Girls Generation song that sounded like they were saying \"I've got a boy on my chin\" - is this a song about having a dead conjoined fraternal twin fetus on your face?  They did let us order the AYCE lunch with 3 minutes to go before dinnertime. Can't say for sure I'll be back but it was worlds better than Sushi 21.",

Service: it was pretty empty in the restaurant when we stopped by at 2 pm on a Friday. The staff was pretty helpful. The waitress always made sure we had water and asked us if we needed anything  Price: 21+ for all you can eat. It's definitely on the cheaper sides of ayce sushi places, which is always a plus  Food: I'm going to be honest, I don't remember everything we got, but I honestly feel like everything they have is good! The nigiri was awesome! The fish the rice ratio was perfect! You should just order a bunch any of this. The monkey brain really stood out and so did the green tea panna cotta.  This place definitely needs a try if you're around the area!",

Ordering more for the all-you-can-eat sushi was easy, fast, and arrived quickly.  Waitstaff was extremely friendly and especially composed for such a busy day.

On top of that I order the miso soup and the green tea ice cream, both very good.  The service was also great.

We sat at the bar and asked for recommendations but instead the sushi chef just started handing us sashimi that I personally don't like to eat. Maybe this is a plus for some people but it filled us up to where we didn't get to order other stuff we wanted because we didn't want to be charged for leftovers. We tried \"the shit\" appetizers which is advertised as a must try but I think it must just consist of leftover fish deep fried and served with the spicy mayo sauce. All their appetizers are tiny which I guess is expected. Nothing stood out at all. Definitely will be sticking to Yama or Tomo in the neighborhood.",

I'm so glad I bit the bullet on this one and squashed the inner voice screaming at me not to risk the bad experience.  WORDS CANNOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE HOW THIS PLACE IS BEYOND FANTASTICALLY, INCREDIBLY GOOD!!!  I tried to start off easy and pace myself but found my self throwing in laundry lists of orders each time and feeding like a bottomless pit that had not eaten for days. I left this establishment on a euphoric food high and dreamy daze for the night.  Pro tips: 1- Sip your drink. You need to save that precious stomach space for more sushi 2- Try the riceless items so you don't get sick of all the sushi rice 3-Save a teeny bit of space for the mini honey toast 4-Order the garlic tuna because it will knock your socks off 5-Now order the garlic tuna 2 more times because one order is not enough and that second order isn't going to be your last...  Did I mention that this place will leave you deliriously happy? Turns out that money can buy you happiness in the form of sushi for only $26. Time to re-evaluate my life goals now that this new data has been made aware to me.",

If you were to buy it piece by piece, you may actually spend less than the AYCE deal.   Orders come out fast and very hot.

I had ordered nigiri garlic tuna and the fish was a darker color and very thick cut. Did not taste fresh at all, our sushi rolls had way too much sauce on them maybe trying to mask the flavor. Customer service lacked as well, one of the servers (had a beard with glasses) kept coming up to the table staring us and walking away totally creeper status made us feel uncomfortable. And to top it off there was a hair on my food. Instead of having the manager apologize and offer a discount or waive the drinks he stated that it happens all the time and it's not under their control, like I'm sorry what? It happens all the time? Like is said instead of apologizing all he did was offer an extra dessert.  How unprofessional is that, especially coming from the owner of the place. Clearly he doesn't care about his customers so due to that I would definitely not come back here again. Make sure you guys check your food before eating it!",

I feel like this place had good fish. That's a big deal because most places in town don't. they were a little heavy on the rice which is kind of typical. a lot of places give way too much rice to make you full faster and then charge you if you leave any rice behind. Albacore is my go to on any menu. I already know that if the albacore isn't up to par the place wasn't very good. fortunately the fish its self was delicious but they put an over whelming amount of toppings on it. i could barely taste the fish. I still haven't found a place that is as good as Sushi Koma in town. Also, I don't like the new remodel of the restaurant. the chairs are uncomfortable and its too claustrophobic.",

I do miss their very cheap prices for AYCE it's gone up a couple of dollars but it's still worth it & cheaper than other AYCE places but they're still much better. I do have to say the desserts for AYCE is limited. Before you could have as much as you want now you can only have one of each dessert not including the ice cream.

And the most important part was the sushi , which tasted old and frozen for far too long. The sushi was very chewey which made inedible.  All in all , this place has gone from a excellent to straight up gross. I've never written a review before,  it's a shame that it has to be a bad one . I will never go to this place again .if I can give it negative stars I would. Unfortunately I have to find another sushi place.  Suggestions welcome.",

But, all the nigiri we had ordered were so fresh that they all melted in your mouth! I loved the cajun tuna the most as it added a little bit more flavor to the tuna. We also got the popcorn lobster roll, which is also another item i've never seen elsewhere before. Their rolls were made of fresh ingredients as well and the popcorn lobster added the perfect crisp to the roll.  I think their prices are very reasonable, but their portions are a little smaller than normal. However, their AYCE price is $25, which makes it all well worth it! They were also very generous on Thanksgiving, they had given us a free plate of sashimi (not sure what type of fish it was) for our table of 9, and that was really fresh as well. All in all, I'm super happy to have found this place as their service was good and patient with our large party.",

The food quality was pretty good the 1st round and came the  second round, everything went downhill from there.   They have people write reviews on yelp to get free drinks...no wonder they have 1400 reviews. The manager or whoever the hell he was (bald guy) was pretty rude and I don't think he knew what he was doing. He tells the paying customers to \" Eat the Rice!\" I understand you want the customers to eat the rice so that they get full faster so they don't order up the whole store but you don't directly tell the customers in a condescending manner to \"eat the rice\".   Charge me extra...i don't want to eat the rice. Save your money and go to another AYCE sushi place. I know for sure I wont be going back.",

Their waiters and waitresses are all very friendly, coming by once in awhile to check if you want to order anything else.   For the sushi itself, they range in price, but are all very good in flavor, freshness, and aesthetic. They are flavored on the sweeter side, but the eel sauce is amazing! There is a huge variety on what you can order. My family and I loved every single one we ordered. They have some spicy options too, which are delicious.   Their appetizers are bomb. Order as many as you want, they're part of the AYCE option too. The bulgogi nachos and the tofu were definitely my favorite.   Bring your appetite because they are very filling!",

By chance, I discovered this place the day I moved here last year; I was driving around and saw the \"Sakana\" sign out of the corner of my eye, looked it up on Yelp and thought, \"Sure, why not?\".. AND I never looked back.   Sakana has an extensive variety of items and even though they're known for their AYCE, the quality is still superb-- 40 appetizers, 30 nigiri, 80 rolls to choose from.. where does one even begin? Best to choose a fish and ask your wonderful server for recommendations on rolls. Some of my favorite items are: pork belly, \"Pang\", garlic tuna, seared lemon salmon, salmon lover roll, no name roll, wet dream, and the oh-so-simple but delicious affogato.  The restaurant is a bit hidden in a shopping center, it does get busy during peak times, but it's still a shorter wait time than some in the area *ahem Yama*. Sakana is intimate with smaller tables, some booths, a few group tables, and a group room. The decor is contemporary traditional, and the music/videos usually playing in the background is K-Pop.  Lunch is $20.95, Dinner is $25.95, and there's 2-for-1 specials on alcoholic beverages. Enjoy, and don't skip out on the ice cream & dessert options!",

It wouldn't hurt to hire at least one or two more servers during rush hour.   They forgot our order towards the end at one point and had to remind them twice about a dish. It finally came out.

We wanted to pay more for the dinner so we could order the salmon belly (no because they don't prepare it early) we had two pieces of sushi left and the busser was hesitant to take it because he wanted to check with the AYCE. Idk it's just never a good experience the last few times I've been there and I probably won't ever again. Sushi Neko is way better. We only came here since they were remodeling.

The fish is fresh and served at a reasonable ratio to rice, unlike some all-you-can-eat places that force globs of rice down your gullet to avoid giving away too much precious meat. And the service is very nice.  The selection outstanding! Lots of great Asian appetizers are part of the all-you-can-eat package. They also offer daily specials that are off menu. I strongly recommend trying the sea trout. In case you don't know what this is, have a little faith, take the plunge and and just try it. It's nothing funky.   I'm a fan of Gorilla Sushi which only a 5 minute drive away. Tough to say which is better. Both are an excellent experience and I dare any True sushi aficionado to find flaw. Sakana is great!",

The set up of the restaurant and the menu has changed over time and it's completely amazing! The lunch is 21.95 up until 3pm and dinner price is around 25-26 which is usually the standard to most sushi places here.   Service ALWAYS CONSISTENT. The workers here are very fast with refilling waters and clearing out the dishes on the table every time I come here. The sushi chefs prepare the sushi at a good amount of time so expect your sushi to be at your table within a few minutes. Completely never have to worry about waiting so long from my experience with anything at this place!  Food The fish to ratio on their rolls and especially their nigiri is a COMPLETE WIN! I can honestly tell you that you will not be disappointed in the ratio. The fish is completely fresh and it just melts in your mouth.   They are very good with their nigiri. Super white tuna and garlic tuna is definitely a must. The flavors on both nigiri work so well together. It completely melts in your mouth. If you're an unagi fan just as much as I am, you must order unagi here! The best one I've had so far. The chefs warm it up to perfection along with the rice and also to top it off, they glaze it with some kind of simple sweet sauce. I am completely drooling just explaining this. It's a MUST try!  Their appetizers are very good too. Bulgogi nachos, anything tempura there is hecka good. Whoever is battering it and cooking the tempura is doing it right! Hamachi Kama is very good too especially when you add some lemon juices to it. Baked green mussels... Wow, so much flavor. Can definitely inhale that every time I'm here and pork belly! Oh my god. Super tender and flavorful.   The rolls are very good too from what I've tried. I definitely need to expand more with rolls. The no name roll, Lisa Lisa, wet dream (if you like cream cheese), and Japanese lasagna is usually what I get. If you can't finish a full, you can actually order half rolls!  Reason why I rate this a 5 is because they've been so consistent with service since day 1! The chef is super nice along his staff. You can easily connect with the sushi chefs with no problem. The atmosphere is completely chill and relaxed AND the music is always good here too. Thank you sakana for the wonderful service and yummy food!",

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were surprised that it was not as crowded as anticipated, feeling that the rating and popularity might be over-exaggerated.  Our skepticism was soon swept away as we were warmly received by a friendly waiter, Kevin.  He walked us through the menu and helped us in placing an initial order.  When the dishes came, we were very impressed by the freshness of various types of the sushi.  All were absolutely delicious!  We had only tried less than a quarter of the items on the menu, but that was all we could take.  I personally would highly recommend the white tuna, raw oyster and salmon belly sushi.  The all-you-can-eat price per head is less than $26, and I can assure the readers that it is worth every penny of it, especially to those who have an exceptional appetite for Japanese sushi!",

For $25pp at dinner, I thought it was pretty reasonable and I ate a LOT. Their fish to rice ratio is as one of the other reviews says about 3:1. It definitely means you can eat more sashimi and less rice, which I appreciate. We ordered almost all the nigiri on the list for dinner and my favorite was probably the hamachi and yuzu hamachi. The seared salmon and eel werepretty good too. A lot of the rolls were also pretty good, but the rice there might fill you up a bit. I ordered a double dragon roll and someone else ordered one of the spicy rolls which were both delicious. The uni was actually pretty fresh when we got it compared to some other reviews and my friends liked the mussels and oysters. I'm just not a big mussel/oyster person in general. We ordered everything off the list that we could only order once, but I thought they were just okay.   What they did lack in was probably organization skills. We had to wait quite awhile to get seated and we were a little confused why a table of 3 who came after our party of 5 was asked to sit down first in a long bench area in the middle of their restaurant when we clearly could have been seated there. Luckily we didn't get seated too late after them as people were leaving, but that was a little annoying. Also one of the appetizers we ordered way early in the evening never got to us until the end of the meal even though we kept asking every time.   All in all, I would come back because I thought it was pretty worth it for all the fish and rolls we ate!",

I've been working in hotels here and in Europe for more than 15 yrs and the rudeness of the small japanese lady that's serving which I believe is the owner goes beyond ridiculous. I thought at first she's trippi'n or just tired which I can tolerate, but no she's just plain racist because I saw the way she treated the other white customer. I call it for what it is. So to the future guest of this fine restaurant best of luck!",

Then their sashimi is cut thick and not kept at a cold temperature, which means risk for food poisoning. The cut of the sashimi is poor quality. If your thinking of coming here because of the four stars be warn the quality is poor.maybe for ayce but not a la carte",

I liked the garlic tuna, white tuna, and yuzu hamachi because of the different sauces they add on. Their spicy tuna does taste different from Hawaii though.. my boyfriend kept saying he didn't like the sushi because it tasted like \"mainland sushi\" and not as fresh.

Fat slices and was fantastic with the sweet rice that was underneath.  A bit too much rice for my liking but I was happy.  My friend got the sashimi platter and I had a tuna slice from there.  The tuna did NOT taste like mine at all... it didn't seem as fresh as it was mushy and stringy..  Large parties, they don't accept reservations on a Saturday night.  Also they only split the checks up to 6 times.  If you are visiting Vegas, this is a decent sushi restaurant but I advise to just go eat a yummy buffet on the strip!",

Advice: don't bring your friends here, it'll just make you look stupid for suggesting   First off the the attendant spilled water on one of my guests and didn't even apologize. He just giggled and walked away to get a rag. Or that's what it looked like.   Then the waitress, after being so rude from the beginning with her introduction on wasting food made a very inappropriate comment. She said even if we waste a bowl of rice they will charge us. Not sure if it was sarcastic, but definitely unprofessional. It could have been worded better. We've been to almost every sushi place in Vegas so I am very familiar with how waiters and waitresses word things and explain rules. This waitress was just horrible!   Then she told one of our guest that he can't just order dessert (even tho it's on the menu with a price).  He'd have to order a regular food item In order to order a dessert item. I understand if we were just a total of 2 or 3 people, but we were 13 people and just so  happen one person wasn't hungry but wanted to hang out with us.  I'm a Business owner as well and I know some rules can be adjusted. If 12 people are eating, why can't 1 person only eat dessert.   I'm sure the owner would be very disappointed In This waitress. She was so horrible   We all ended up walking out and getting seated at Yama sushi right across the street   We will never go to Sakana again.  The restaurant basically lost $300 in food sales not Including tips because they would not sell only dessert to 1 of 13 guests. Not to mention all the potential return future visits.   Plain stupid  Day after follow up:  We ended going to Yama sushi across the street and they seated us with no problems. When we mentioned one person will only be eating dessert, they just said it's ok like it's normal for them. Not a big deal. We tipped them very well",

    "text": "The food and menu is amazing. The service is terrible.   My boyfriend and I discovered this place and thought we hit the jackpot. Returned a few more times and determined the restaurant is under staffed resulting in slow service.   This last visit ended my desire to ever return. My boyfriend and I took our parents to the restaurant for their first time. We waited a decent amount of time to be seated. Once we got our table, we continued to wait for our waiter to come and take our order. After waiting so long, we decided to order every roll we would want when our waitor came, so we wouldn't have to wait again if we wanted more food.   Our waiter, Ron, finally came and took our order. I, my boyfriend, and my mom order 9 rolls total - 3 each.   We continued to wait for our sushi. About 40mins passed and my dad - politely asked - how much longer for our food. Ron, the waiter, replied with a tone of disrespect, \"you ordered nine rolls.\"  I am not a person who gets upset normally, but it upset me that my waitor would reply this way when we just wanted to know where our food was since we had waited so long.   Really sad and probably won't return.",

    "text": "First visit to Salana and I enjoyed it very much! My sister, Crystal suggested we (family) try this place out. Of course, we ended up choosing the AYCE dinner ($25.95 per person).   What we ordered (all of the items were one time dinner only):  - Ocean Trout marinated in garlic ponzu (too fatty) - Salmon Belly (I didn't care for it) - Oyster (delicious) - Uni (Sea Urchin caviar) (THE BEST UNI I'VE EVER HAD!) - Ama Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) (delicious)  You can order anytime (lunch/dinner):  - Ikura (Salmon Roe) (delicious but too SALTY) - Yellowtail (Hamachi) - Garlic Tuna - Super White Tuna (tasted so good) - Yuzu Yellow Tail - Sarada Lobster (it was ok) - Aomori Scallop (was too dry) - Surf Clam (was \"meh\") - Tobiko (caviar which had hints of citrus and wasabi flavors... I didn't quite like it) - Calamari Tempura (the meat was too tender. I like it when the meat's a tad bit chewier.) - Shrimp Tempura (it was ok.. the batter wasn't crispy) - Seafood Salad (wasn't great.. It looked like they gave all of the leftovers)  Dessert:  - Mochi Ice Cream (coffee): It tasted fine. I just wish they didn't split it down the middle. - Green Tea Panna Cotta (It was good!) - Black Sesame Panna Cotta (This tasted gross to me, but my sister and Mom enjoyed it very much!) - Green Tea Ice Cream (I couldn't taste a whole lot of the green tea flavor which really disappointed me!)  My entire experience here was great! Our server, Jeong ho, was nice and attentive! Seating didn't take very long... I remember waiting less than 5 - 10 minutes! I was glad that the nigiri sushi tasted fresh!!  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone who loves nigiri sushi!! Come during dinner time so you could try everything! I would gladly come eat here, again!",

    "text": "My friend introduced us to this off-the-Strip AYCE (all you can eat) sushi place and we've been coming back ever since! If we're craving some sushi for a great deal, this is the place we go. Talk about less rice, more fish - and they have a good variety too!  PARKING: Parking can get a little scarce here, but the restaurant is located in a plaza. You might have to park a little further, but you should be able to find a spot. Spots can be a bit tight.  WAIT: We've only ever come in for lunch (so not sure how the dinner rush is), but there is a wait. Luckily for us, when we've come here the past few times, we haven't had to wait for more than 30 mins. Depends on the rush though! Try to beat the crowds and get here earlier than 11:30am for lunch. Even after 1pm, there are groups of people rolling in.  SEATING: Indoor seating only and there are several tables (it's pretty big in there!). Lots of tables for two as well as some tables to accommodate larger groups. They also have a sushi bar if you prefer to sit there (or ask for first available).  FOOD: The AYCE menu literally comes with everything. You can order sushi, hand rolls, specialty rolls, and even side dishes (think teriyaki, yakitori, miso soup, salads, etc.). We always order a lot during the first round and the servers end up making a face that seems to signal \"They really think they can eat that much?\". The answer is YES. We can eat that much.",

    "text": "AYCE sushi that's good quality but also affordable is truly difficult to come across yet Sakana did it. If you haven't eaten here before, now would be a good time to. Or anytime is a good time to.   Where do I even begin? Let's do bad news first. There's gonna be a wait here, but it's worth it. So wait it out cause you're gonna be getting amazing sushi. Okay, now to the actual important stuff. The rice to fish ratio is amazing, you get maybe a tiny bit of rice for a generous piece of fish for the nigiri so you're getting 75% melt-in-your-mouth-quality fish and 25% rice. Also, order more nigiri, try to limit yourself on the rolls or you'll get full too quickly. They have pretty good handrolls and appetizers and skewers too if you wanna diversify yourself from nigiri and rolls. They have a la carte prices next to everything and I played a little game of how much did I eat compared to what I actually spent. For 3 people eating ayce dinner at $25.95 each, we ate about $180 worth of sushi. If you want to gorge on rolls go ahead, I won't judge you.  So there you go, ayce sushi at great prices, quality, and portions. What's not to love about Sakana?",

We came on a Tuesday night around 7 and there was no wait. Immediately we ordered the salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, and oysters. These are all items you can only order once when doing AYCE. The salmon belly was TO DIE for! These items alone are worth the AYCE price since they are normally $4-5 each. They also had some sashimi specials that we could only order once. We didn't bother with the sushi rolls since we didn't want to fill up on too much rice. Mostly just ordered nigiri and if you like the raw stuff this is the best way to go to maximize your belly space. The last items we ordered were the shu mai and the shit. I didn't care for either items honestly. Those were the only dishes I would've rather skip but everything else was great!  As everyone mentioned, you can't have any leftover items or they will charge you extra so take it slow and order a little at a time. The service was great so it was very easy to continuously order additional items.",

I tried nearly all the tempuras and left wishing I had space for more. ALL of the sushi rolls on the front AND back of the menu are included in the AYCE.   They do have some rules that it may be wise to follow, like for example, you have to finish everything on your plate - so pace yourself. They only let you order a few at a time anyway, but just in case you're feeling ambitious, be careful!",

The quality of the fish itself was incredible, and if you consider the price ($26 for AYCE dinner), it is insane value. I love that you get A LOT of fish per nigiri and just a little rice so you don't get full too quickly. I think towards the end, our rice ratio went up, but that's completely fine!  Some of our favorite nigiris were: ocean trout, salmon belly, super white tuna, freshwater eel, garlic tuna, yuzu lemon tail and seared lemon salmon  [the first 2 you can only order once at dinnertime]  Other items that stood out were the Pang (a cheesy salmon garlic bread appetizer) and No Name hand roll   We came at around 9pm, were the 11th party on the waitlist, and got seated in 20 min. Ordering was super fast and efficient. The food came out with barely any wait. Great establishment.",

    "text": "What an amazing restaurant this place is! The restaurant is located off the strip but it is definitely worth checking out if you are a sushi/Japanese food fan!!   Came here on a Monday night for dinner. Got here just after 7.30pm and noted down our name and table size on their waitlist. We were a group of 12 so it was quite tough to get a table straight away. We ended up waiting for 30 mins and split our tables to a table of 8 and a table of 4.  The restaurant offer all you can eat (AYCE) sushi for $30 during dinner. You are given 90 minutes to order and also finish your food in that timeframe. To avoid wastage, the restaurant imposes $6 per dish for wasted food.  Once we all sat down, the waiter provided us with a menu list to order from. Similar to some dim sum places out there, you note down the dishes as well as the quantity you would like to order.  We ordered a whole lot of sushis, skewers and appetizers. We were hungry and almost at a blink of an eye, we were overwhelmed with sushis coming at all different directions - in a good way of course.   The food was so good (and there was so much of it) that we did not even order a second round. I am not a fan of raw fish myself but I was with a group of sushi fans and they gave their thumbs up. I myself enjoyed the shrimps on the skewer, tofu, California roll and tempuras. I looked at the menu the next day and realised the restaurant also offers noodles/ramen as part of their all you can eat offering.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant who is visiting Vegas and is into their sushi/Japanese food. Just remember to strategize your ordering to ensure you get to try out all the different dishes.   Dinner ended up costing $40 p/p which included drinks, tax and gratuity. The restaurant is approx 15 mins in a cab from the Strip, depending on traffic. Also not everyone in your group needs to order the AYCE menu. We had a few vegan friends who ordered off their regular menu.",

Second, the selection was great - not only could you get a bunch of different appetizers, you could also get nigiri (and they give big slices of fish and don't try to overload the rice!), a whole bunch of sushi rolls including baked rolls, hand rolls, and specialty rolls, and dessert. The food was all delicious and we all left super stuffed and happy.  Some of the food that we really enjoyed: - Ocean trout nigiri  - Salmon nigiri - Eel nigiri  - Dragon roll - Spider roll - Fried banana dessert, black sesame dessert   Would skip next time: - Tobiko sushi - had a strange fishy taste  - Lobster nigiri - tasted more like imitation crab  - Tiramisu dessert - dry  - Quail egg sushi - literally had a raw quail egg  - Bacon wrapped scallops or lobster skewers - the ratio of bacon to scallop/lobster was way off and all you could taste was bacon   Would definitely come back if in Las Vegas!",

I went with a group of 5 for lunch and we ordered the seared and lemon salmon, yellowtail, halibut, rolls, and so on.   It was annoying how the rice on the rolls kept falling apart. They're supposed to be nice and sturdy when you pick up a roll. The eel and ponzu sauce were bland to me. Everything else was just basic. Not worth my money tbh.  The service was okay. The server needs to have a positive personality because it looks like he's not having a good day. It could've been better because I'm a high tipper based on service.   Cute decor but that's pretty much it. I wouldn't come back here since I've had better quality in California.",

Sakana opens up to a beautiful center table with a floral backdrop. It's a small place but plenty of seating. We got seated after about 20minutes.   We all decided to do all you can eat this evening. It was about $26. We ordered the specials and a few orders of sashimi. One of the reasons why I like Sakana is that they don't pack their sushi with rice. It's actually heavy in the fish and limited in rice. Also-the service was really fast.   They get the orders out fairly fast. Service has always been good at Sakana. The staff is a little quiet but that's okay!   We also ordered some uni and it was fresh! It didn't taste---off. haha. This is definitely in the top of my sushi list.",

    "text": "This is my favorite AYCE sushi spot and a hidden gem! The sushi to rice ratio is amazing! They don't stuff a lot of rice which makes it the best compared to other places. The fish is fresh and the rolls are delicious. A lot of variety and choices on their menu. I honestly feel that you get more than your money's worth eating here.   The place is decorated nicely, feels like I'm in Japan! Good for date night or just casual grubbing.   They get very busy, so expect to wait for lunch and dinner rushes. Overall the wait is worth it, knowing you'll get good, quality sushi. Make sure to add this place on your list, you'll be leaving full and satisfied!",

    "text": "This place is probably a 4.5 stars, but I rounded up for one reason only: the unagi. The freshwater eel is the best eel I've ever had at a sushi restaurant. The quality of all the fish is pretty good, but the eel is definitely a standout. All of the other appetizer dishes were okay. Got the agedashi tofu, hamachi Kama, salmon Kama, vegetable tempura, and miso soup. The miso soup isn't very good.   The service is okay, pretty chaotic and a few times had to tell numerous waiters that we were missing some items. The restaurant is really crowded, though, and the staff tries to accommodate more to the bigger parties, which makes sense.   Didn't get the chance to try the rolls, but I'll probably be back in Vegas in the future and maybe I'll get to try them then! The No Name roll looks really good :)",

    "text": "Wow. Just freaking WOW. I didn't know what to expect, but I was blown away by the freshness and quality of the nigiri and sashimi at Sakana for the dinner price of $26!  I ate uni, fatty salmon belly, mackerel, octopus, some foreign roe I haven't eaten before among a bunch of different pieces! Pretty sure I downed 50 or so pieces of sushi and a few fried skewers, karaage, and fried shishitos! I can't remember all the pieces I ate, but I have to say I liked the nigiri and sashimi better than the appetizers! I would load up on sushi for the all you can eat, seeing that there is a 90 minute time limit (I did, however, inhale my sushi feast in an hour). The chefs making the sushi were amazing -- the guys easily remember your lengthy order and cut generous chunks of fish for each piece of nigiri! Some pieces even seemed to have more fish than rice. Lol  One thing to note is the wait -- I got there at 8:00pm Friday night, and waited about 30 minutes to get seated (party of one). If you come in groups of 3 or more especially, prepare to wait awhile (40-60 minutes).  Pro tips: make sure to get the special 1 order only items on the menu and the white board behind the sushi bar -- these are the richest and most indulgent dinner pieces you'll get on the buffet.  I was certainly not disappointed and will be back if I ever find myself in Vegas!",

    "text": "*rolls outside after eating my weight in sushi*  Okay, the AYCE option is worth every penny for what you are able to get! The quality, presentation, and selection is all there and I could not be any happier. This place is just slightly on the outskirts of Vegas, but worth going to if you are looking for a sushi place without spending a fortune.  As part of the AYCE, they have some prime cuts of fish such as fatty salmon belly that you're only able to get one serving of, but that's okay. Let it melt in your mouth and order something else. Variety is the spice of life so get your single serving of this and move on! Plenty of options to choose from.  I'd advice you to only get the half rolls at a time and do not get too overzealous and order too much because your appetite may be larger than your stomach. Trust me, I know from experience.  Hope you enjoy this place as much as I did!",

He gives little suggestions here and there \"Oh you definitely want this one here...\" or \"try the black sesame dessert.\" The service is very fast, and I love the ambiance with the cherry blossoms hanging from the sealing. There is usually a small wait where you sign in yourself, but I only waited max 10 minutes in the past.   The AYCE specials for lunch $20.95 and dinner $25.95 are awesome. There are a couple items that are one time only (ocean trout, and for dinner one time only the salmon belly, oyster, uni, ama ebi). The ocean trout is incredible, and it is all such a good deal! You can't go wrong with any of the rolls, but I especially liked the Be Happy:) roll (soft shell crab with tuna/salmon all drenched in mayo/eel/so sauce), and the no rice (dinner only time) rolls because they stack on the sashimi. I also love the agedashi tofu. It comes with a dessert, and I would recommend the affogato (ice cream with korean style coffee).",

We loved this place so much that we went twice in a week, first for lunch and then for dinner.  And the reason for the five star rating is... their NIGIRI! If I could, I would have only nigiri every time I go eat sushi. However, most AYCE places load each piece with rice, either with a decent or a paper thin slice of fish on top. But SAKANA is not such place. Their nigiri has a small ball of rice with a thick and long slice of fish on top. The best part, all the different topings and sear combinations to keep it exciting.  That said, the rolls we had were surprisingly full of rice with an average taste. The baked ones were alright, but for the most part I wouldn't bother. Just go with the nigiri!!  Their bacon wrapped lobster and scallop skewers are very good and so are the baked mussles appetizers. Included dessert is quite amazing too. First place I'll visit next time I'm in Vegas!!",

The service was good, the food was fast and the prices were on point. Menu is very long for AYCE and quality is exceptional- we have found 'our place' when we come back to LV which is usually about twice a year.   Tip: noon - 2pm is super slow, locals apparently don't do lunch",

We were going to order rolls, however the waiter suggested if we order more than 4 rolls we should do all you can eat. We didn't want to but then we said okay. All you can eat is a joke. It took them forever to bring the food and they forgot half of the things we ordered. I have to remind the waiter. I don't recommend all you can eat if you eat here. Horrible experience. The service is very bad too. We're not coming back here no more",

Solid choice for AYCE sushi - very competitive with other options in LV, but not quite distinguishable as the best or among the very best, without some menu and service enhancements.",

Then one day we came back and they were very busy... ( might I mention the place is so small and not many waiting seats.. so it forces you to stand for however long it takes! ANNOYING but we thought they were worth the wait. The 2 for 1 beers are dope.) Well we end up getting seated and ate. I didn't really order much but  it was a good night.  About 4 days later I'm craving sushi again and end up going just to see that they are closed with a huge health violation sign on the door.. I was very let down & freaked out. It remained for about a week.. and we actually ended up going back to eat there once we saw the sign was gone...But the day we came back they were circling around asking if the food was good with a booklet.. I'm assuming cause they possibly got new fish?? idk.. the violation must of had to do something with all the questions... Anyways my boyfriend ended up getting very very sick  that day!!! :( and I seriously haven't eaten sushi since then... Sakana definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. New fish old fish no thank you!! The vendor or whoever they get their supply from is horrible!",

The fish was very fresh and the ratio of rice to fish was definitely heftier on a fish side. )) The presentation was wonderful and the service was fast. It's a wonderful place for your buck, considering price/quality issues. They also have a lovely decor, with lots of whimsical toys and my favorite - Totoro character sitting cushions.  The only reason I took off one star, is because I was offered a corner table (I was with a kid) and when I looked under the table there were pieces of food and a chop stick left by the previous patrons. The server apologized for it, but did nothing to clean it up. ((",

The waitress was very pushy when we got there- they have a large menu and when your new to sushi it takes a bit longer to read through. The service was great other than that. I just had to tell her I wasn't ready yet and she kind of mocked me.  Great place to go. We would go back",

Instead of orders; they go by rounds.  I felt that everything we had order was prepared very nicely.  Service was on top and constantly around to refill my water.  I have got to say, the rolls were very decent sized and covered with a good portion of fish.    Overrall, my buddy and I had not stomach issues after.

    "text": "I literally have no complaints. It was a Tuesday night, and it wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. Our server was nice and cracked a few jokes, as we walked in even the guys behind the sushi bar making food all yelled \"welcome!\" The fish to rice ratio as I've read in other reviews, was correct, so much fish! Loved that. All that rice fills you up quickly so I was glad I could keep trying more. Fish was fresh, love there tuna and yuzu yellowtail with jalapeno (favorite everywhere I go) I came here wanting to try a few new things, like salmon eggs, it wasn't bad, but not my thing. I know a lot of people who love it though. I also tried the pork belly which was sooooo tender. That was good, I tried there Asian pear sake and another one that was yogurt based? Tasted like peach? Both good but I liked the peach one more, tad bit stronger. Every dish we tried I had no disappointments. GREAT PRICES! There AYCE is awesome! Possibly my new favorite sushi spot, sushi food wise. Only wish they were in a better location. Defiantly going back!",

Since it was 2:30p already and we were not that hungry, we opted to order al-la-carte.  The menu looks good though.  It has all kinds of skewers but mostly rolls.  We ordered the 'Snow in Vegas', 'Lemon Salmon', 'Chef #1' and they were all good.  We also had the monkey brain which is tempura banana with spicy crab (interesting).  The server was very attentive.  Since I have my child with me, the only drawback is that most of the rolls are spicy and there were many 'bad' words on the menu.  Other than that, I would definitely go back especially when I am hungry for Japanese rolls.",

I YELPed and saw all the stars. The moment we arrived we were seated right away and had drinks and food within 3-5 min, no lie. There was not one time we did not have food in our mouths, service was that good. The chef at the sushi bar was really nice and made us a habanero roll but tweeked my roll since I have shellfish allergies. Since then we have been regulars! I've brought so many people there and they all love it. Highly recommend the call 911 for those we love spice and their nigiri! Fish is so fresh and this is the only AYCE I've been to who gives thick slices of fish and little amount of rice. We are regulars here. The other great thing is the 2 for 1 drinks which include soju!! They have a variety of appetizers which are all amazing. Great customer service, great food, always leaving stuffed and in a food coma!",

We were going to try a different sushi place, but their electricity was out, so we turned to Yelp. I'm so glad that we did!  The place looked a little run down from the outside, but the inside was nice.  It was about $20 for AYCE lunch (which is an amazing deal since we ate so much). Service was a little slow at first, but it wasn't too bad after we got our first plate.  The food was amazing! Usually with AYCE sushi, they load the rolls with a ton of rice, but the fish-to-rice ratio was great.  Everything tasted really fresh and there were so many different rolls to try (none of them I disliked). It was so good, we want to make the 10 hr drive (from AZ) just to go back there.  We even joke about moving next door. (:",

Sakana seems to have more rolls with very \"interesting\" names which you'll have to ask your waiter to find out the ingredients.  We tried and did like all the popular ones but having to ask what each was made of was a little annoying.  Sushi was great and fresh.  Portion size of fish is larger than Goyemon.  Ama Ebi was served without rice which is different but kinda nice (space saving).  The grilled pork belly app was really good.  Would definitely go back.  Service was fast and you order by checking off on a sheet for most of the menu which I kinda prefer as you get to see how much you are ordering per round.  Rest of my table was a little disappointed by limited dessert menu (compared to Goyemon) but I didn't mind.  Didn't come here for dessert.",

With several cars in the parking lot we were hoping it was a good sign of a local favorite, and sure enough it was! We sat at the bar and were able to ask for suggestions...every bite aMaZiNg! We went for the AYCE and were not disappointed... Fave rolls: Wet dream, what the heck, be happy, Mexican, baked scallop just to name a few. We will be back!!",

I spent 2 hours at this place and was only able to get 2 rounds. They never even finished making what we ordered during the 1st round, and this was when there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant. Literally, dishes came 1 at a time with a span of like 20 minutes in between. Luckily, there was a tv showing a documentary of a Japanese sushi chef or else we would have fallen asleep. We were able to watch the entire documentary while waiting for our food.  So, thank you Mr sushi chef who spent his entire life devoted to his restaurant!! If it wasn't for you, my $21 would have definitely gone to waste!",

The AYCE includes salads, soup, appetizers, sushi, and dessert.  Love that the rice for nigiri wasn't a huge amount; most places try to fill you up by putting a lot of rice.  All the fish was fresh and so many different rolls to try.  Service was really quick; we ordered four rounds of sushi and never had to wait long for our food. Great place to take a group of friends.",

    "text": "I came here with friends from work for my \"birthday lunch\" on July 10, 2014. I am a bit behind on my review writing so I will try to include the highlights, or lowlights as it may be, from my memory. I was eagerly anticipating a spectacular birthday lunch based upon the reviews and the pictures taken. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed and actually left hungry, which is saying a lot for an AYCE place. There were only a couple other tables there at lunch. There was only one waiter which made service incredibly and painfully slow. In anticipation of how long it would take to get our order, as we thought the response time from when we sat down was indicative of the service, we ordered a mass amount of sushi initially - probably 4 orders of nigiri, 4 hand rolls and three cut rolls. There were four of us. Waiter consistently forgot about 1/3 of our orders. My friend must have requested the same hand roll about four times and still didn't get it by the time we left. Also, the specials on the board were not available at lunch - so be careful this was one of the reasons we came were some of the specials. The fish to rice ratio was decent but if they forget 1/3 of your orders I am sure they can afford to cut the rice down on what they serve. The sushi in and of itself was okay, nothing memorable and pretty standard. I would avoid \"the shit\" despite the accolades provided by other yelpers it was nothing more than a fried mess. After about two hours of fighting through this horrible experience we finally left - we didn't get dessert because we were on \"lunch\" and were already really late and just couldn't take the agonizing service anymore. It was the perfect storm of forgetful slow waiter, slow sushi chef and being understaffed. I dont' know if the other yelpers came at night and the staff gears it up for the evening but my experience is one I hope to never repeat again in my life. Also, be warned that they didn't provide soda fountain drinks, if you buy a soda it is just a can. Also, the green iced tea is not brewed (despite the representation that it was) and is merely a mix, this was apparent by not only the taste but the mix floating around in the drink.    So so sad that I wasted my birhday lunch here...",

Their rolls are so yummy, I love the salmon lemon roll, the jalapeno bombs, the shit, anything off the spicy section, the monkey brains, the green muscles... I could go on and on. The customer service is amazing not to mention the buy one get one free on sake and beer. When it's slow they'll even do shots with you and give you special creations to try on the house.

Great attentive staff, clean restaurant with great decor.   Fresh fish! Great if you love nigiri. They don't put too much rice.   The menu has so many options for specialty rolls.  The only roll I hated was the king lobster roll.. The yam yam sauce just tasted so weird with the roll but that's just my opinion.   I will be returning!!",

We weren't taken to our seat just told to sit in the corner and she pointed.  After about 5 minutes a waiter came over to our table with soda's, but we hadn't ordered drinks yet.  No apology or asking us what we would like, he just turned away and took them to the table that had ordered them.  Customers should never sit for more than 10 minutes without a greeting and being asked if they would like beverages.  After being there for 15 minutes, we had to leave.  We want to order food sometime today at at the rate they were going, it was not going to happen.  It was not even busy.",

Okay first off, sushi here is legit their fish to rice ratio with the nigiri is like 3:1. The staff here is lovely, very patient and really caters to your needs. As with any sushi place the wait is exceptionally long. But it's totally worth it. The vibes here are amazing I highly suggest this place for birthdays they hype up the restaurant just for you! A lot of options on the menu, and the desserts are unlike any other sushi place. Sakana will always be my first choice for sushi in Vegas!",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY enjoyed this restaurant, despite how difficult it was to find, park and then locate as the name on the outside says Kabuki.   Based on recommendations from yelpers, I wanted to try this out as my 100th review of the year / Yelp 100 Challenge.  I wanted my review to be on a restaurant, and something to compare.  I was very happy in Sakana!  a.  Crowded - Oddly not very busy. Only three of us at the bar.This was at noon for lunch. b.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, and at same time comfortable.  c.  Service - Key attribute here.  Everyone is nice and friendly and always available! d.  Food - Ahhh,  this is where the placed excelled!  -To test the quality of this place, i chose the basics that I eat at all sushi places  - Amai Ebi - Loved the small and delicate shrimp.  The fried fish heads were perfect,  - Uni - Ahh, what a unique way they prepare it.  Absolutely delicious.  Based on these two, the taste, texture and results were 5 star.  We also had Hamachi and Tuna both belly fat cuts. Tobiko, Mirugai,  We had a fine selection of nigiri sushi that Chef Sai made when I told him I wanted to focus on traditional sushi.  I would say, what a great chef and great choices.  We had a special tuna with jalapeno on it and that too was darn good.  What I really enjoyed besides Chef Sai reading my mind and starting to make me some great stuff, is that all the nigiri sushi came with a very small amount of rice, so you had plenty of room for the fish.  That was awesome. I basically asked the Chef to make me some traditional nigiri sushi and I like the weird stuff, no rolls.  This place is definitely going to come to you.  Great Quality, great taste.  GK says gottta come back!  This place is great!",

Our servers were still attentive and came to check up on us for new orders and to refill our drinks. Major props to the people working here!  Only complaint I had was that because it was so busy, all the people waiting tried to fit into their entrance/waiting area, which is super small. People were actually standing in the dinning area and blocking the exit.",

This is the only AYCE that delivers anywhere near that same quantity and quality of fish.  Every other place fills you up with a mass of rice and only a tiny bit of fish, but this place finally does things properly!  The mix of Korean and Japanese appetizers are pretty good and all the desserts we've tried have been tasty.  The restaurant itself is decorated to the gills and absolutely BLASTING K-pop music.  The lines on the weekend nights are out the door so be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large group.  Obnoxiously crowded and loud places like this usually kill it for me, but their amazing FISH never disappoints and I'll come back every time just for that!",

If you go on the weekend, you might end up waiting 30-45 minutes before you're seated! Also, the tables are so close together and it's a really small place so it always feels a bit crowded! Since I'm not too big on seafood... My favorite roll has to be \"Lisa Lisa\". It has crab, shrimp, cucumber, cream cheese & avocado! And lots of tempura crumbs! So yummy! The service is usually pretty fast too! They just keep it coming. The servers come around quite frequently to ask if you'd like more food & they bring it out just minutes after ordering! Their dessert is pretty good! It's $25.99 for all you can eat. They have a specialty dessert menu in which you get to choose only one thing and then they have ice cream which you can eat as much as you want. They have red bean ice cream (which I'm not a fan of) and green tea ice cream which is delicious! They used to have a flavor called \"plum\" which didn't actually taste like plum, but I absolutely loved it. It was my favorite and I recently noticed it wasn't on their menu anymore. I asked about it and unfortunately... The vendor just doesn't make that flavor anymore. The only down fall I would say is that they don't have a soda fountain. They only have cans of soda and charge you $1.50 for each can! I usually just stick to water with lemon! Overall... I will definitely keep coming back to this place! Especially for their Lisa Lisa!",

Upon entering this god given place you're immediately greeted by everyone and seated quickly, which is nice. I like getting noticed and eating right away hehe. The decorations are pretty generic same as every other sushi restaurant nothing special. As for wait times my friend and I came in at 8 and were seated immediately. If you're just coming with two people just seat at the bar its so much better trust me! When you order some rolls the chef can just immediately hand it to you instead of waiting for a server to bring it over. We left around 9:30 and the place started to get popping, so wait times can be not steady.  The servers here are so nice and on top of it!!! They would always ask if I was okay, if I wanted any more appetizers and rolls. The guy who was making my sushi (sai) was no exception to this too. He treated us very well, and made our sushi quickly after we ordered.   Soooo lets start with the appetizers! What a breathe of fish air seeing new food at ayce sushi! We got some staples first; shrimp tempura, pork belly, and edamame. The shrimp tempura was lacking in flavor to be honest. The pork belly on the other hand is so goddamn good, so freaking fatty jkasdl;fj;ksdaasd;kj yum.   Moving on to their different types of appetizers the Bul-go-gi nacho! What a presentation masterpiece! It comes with in four nacho typa things with some fish and other spices on top. Definitely would order again. The japanese nacho on the other hand wasn't to my liking. I was a fan of the beef on top but not so much of the sauce they juiced it with it was a bit too much. Oh btw unlimited mochii hehehe. Their coffee mochi is really strong though so beware!  For sushi I feel like this places thrives more on presentation than most other ayce sushi. Every roll that comes out are all instagram worthy. And all were 10/10. We ordered tons of sushi so I can't go through every one we ordered. They were all exceptional. But the two that were the best was the jackpot roll and special white tuna. The jackpot roll is decorated with a bunch of sprinkles so it looks like a cereal but do not underestimate it's greatness. Do your taste buds a favor and introduce them to something out of this world :)  PRO TIP! If you're just coming with TWO PEOPLE SEAT AT THE BAR its so much better trust me! AND GET THE SASHIMI SALAD!!!!!  I honestly would not change anything about this wonderful wonderful place. It's officialy my new ayce sushi favorite. And it's so close to UNLV!",

There was a small group of loud women, so I asked for a table on the other side of the restaurant where it was quieter.  The waiter looked at me and said, \"There are no quiet areas right now\".  I pointed to the other side of the restaurant and asked if I could sit there.  He rudely said, \"NO that is not a table for one!\"  I was so shocked I turned around and walked out.  I heard him throw the menus on the table.  I had never been there before and will never go back.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. Their fish to rice ratio for Nigiri is great. You can wrap the fish at least twice around the rice. They have a large all you can eat menu and they let you order half rolls. I prefer half rolls for all you can eat because I like to eat lots of different things so this is a huge bonus for me. The service is great, everyone is really friendly. They are busy a lot so come a little bit early because you will probably have to wait for a table.   They also have a great variety of Sake and Soju here (yogurt soju is amazing). The variety in their rolls is alright. There's a lot of crab filled rolls but the menu is really large for an AYCE place so there's likely to be something for everyone. My favorite is the Lemon Salmon Roll and the Don't cry Amigo.   My husband and I have been here several times in our five years in Vegas. Always come back to this place because of the service and the menu. Everything is fresh and delicious. Though in the summer it gets a little warm in here with all the people so come later in the evening or for lunch!",

Service: 5 stars, we were treated like we were the only customers there, checked up on often, sushi came out fast, everyone was friendly and our drinks were often refilled. What more can you ask for?  Decor: 4.5 stars, the outside is misleading (and like some mentioned the location a little  hard to find, yelp had us on the other side of town). Anyways, the inside is cozy, well decorated and for the anime fan inside me they had Totoro seat cushions, I died of pure happiness, took me back to my childhood.  Food: sushi and non sushi items were fantastic! Taking someone to an ayce sushi restaurant that hates sushi had me worried but she agreed the tempura and fried rice were delicious & helped the rest of our party not feel too guilty dragging her here, she was pleased.  Sushi 5 stars in originality and sauces. The super white tuna sauce is to die for! I've never had anything like it, I wish I could have gotten it on everything :) the Chanel roll and be happy roll are killer I'd highly recommend them if you like fresh raw fish.  Great sushi gem off the strip I will definitely be back.",

Knowing it would be busy we were ready to wait 30 minutes or so for a table for 6 but Apparently if you slip the host a $20.00 bill he'll get you seated before everyone else who has been waiting.   We were the 3rd ones on the list and I was keeping eye out for our name to be called. A gentlemen walks in , leans over host stand whispering something to host and trying to hand him a $20.  Since I was standing pretty much behind him I witnessed this as well as the other guests who were next on the list.   The host tried to shrug him off because I was eyeing the whole situation but guest was persistent on making this happen and the host did.   The guest then went to grab the rest of his party and the host sat them down and the guest gave him money. As I watched this happen the host then went back to the stand and I asked him where was his name because I pointed to the other guests who was next and told him they were next.   He got nervous when I told him I saw him walk in and pretty much give him money to sit them down before everyone else.   He told me they just came and sat down and he'll fix it and I said no, he gave you money to get them seated and you sat them.   Anyways, end of story he got them to get up from table and they had to wait like everyone else. Playing dumb like they didn't know what happened and why they had to get up. Other guests who was next was seated and host got removed from front and manager took over.   Should of gave host more because all that scene for $20.00... smh. lol  Food is awesome and the only reason why I stayed is because I had a family of 6 waiting to eat and I didn't want everyone driving to another spot to eat at.",

The quality is good for most rolls but a couple was a bit too wet where I had to tilt the plate so that the juices/sauces would pool up on the lower end and not right under the sushi pieces.   Nigiri - fish portion was astronomically larger than the rice portion.  This is a huge plus which greatly enhanced the dining experience.  The rolls had a good amount of fish as well.    Overall, the experience was great and we enjoyed it.  Ambiance was nice and the wait time was not too long.  Service was quick after order being placed as well.",

The restaurant was playing popular upbeat music , and had perfect lighting for the ambiance. They sat us in a booth which was very spacious. The decor was pleasing and they had little character seat cushions which I thought looked cool.   They had plenty of choices on their AYCE menu.  $20.95 for lunch and $25.95 for dinner. Kids price is $14.95. The proportion of fish on the nigiris were generous. The food tasted good as well. Don't order the shumai, they were tiny and burnt.   Service was ok. Not amazing, but not bad either. I didn't get the server's name.  I wasn't offered a refill the whole time I was there. The bussers and food runners seem to be on point though! I kept having to look for my server to order. In the end I still enjoyed my first visit there.",

Ventilation isn't too good here so don't wear your nicest stuff as you will leave smelling like food. Enjoy!   I had to edit my review. I initially had this review at 4 stars but then the bill came and the lady who seemed to run the place was straight up rude. I'll spare you having to read through the situation but what I can say is that all you can eat sushi spots are typically the same and what sets them apart is service. The lady who runs this place doesn't understand the concept of good service.  Oh, and the reason why this place has so many reviews is bc they'll give you a free small beverage once you review.

I highly recommend getting the nigiri, the fish pieces are large and in charge :) The rolls were just ok in comparison, but if you like lots of rice and fried stuff, you may enjoy those too. We ordered many items including the pork belly, \"the shit\" edamame, salmon, tuna, eel, dragon roll, and the lemon salmon roll. For dessert, we got the mini honey toast, which was good and reminded me of a sweet Hawaiian roll with ice cream on top. If you're in Vegas, skip the strip and head over here. Will be back!",

    "text": "Perfect place for ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI! You can dine either al a carte or choose the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) option for a flat fee of $25. I highly recommend the AYCE option because about two rolls and a seaweed salad amounts to $25 so you might as well do the AYCE which includes  appetizers, sushi rolls, nigiri, and dessert. It is a small place so I recommend making a reservation for the weekends or going on a week day to avoid the crowds. Without a reservation I've waited as long as an hour for a table on a Friday night. It's a pretty intimate setting so it's great for date night  as well as dinner with a small group of friends. Again if dining with more than 5 people I would recommend making a reservation.   Appetizers - They by far have the best seaweed salad in town! I have a few staples I order every time which include edamame, baked mussels, cucumber salad, seafood salad, and \"the shit\" (trust me, you'll love it).   Rolls - I haven't had a roll I didn't like yet. The fish quality is great but my favorites are the Chanel Roll, Sashimi Roll (instead of rice its rolled in cucumber) , Rainbow Roll, White Vegas Snow and Jackpot Roll.  Nigiri - They have a great fish to rice ratio! They give you huge pieces of fish and it's so fresh. I recommend the salmon and yellowtail.  Dessert - I ordered the coffee mochi and it was really dry as if it was old. I do definitely recommend their red bean ice cream if they have it.",

    "text": "I look back at my experience here and just laugh. Unlimited sushi....what could go wrong?! So this probably should have been more intuitive than it was but you are expected to finish every single piece of anything you order--even if you don't like it. Basically you're SOL if you don't like a roll so make sure to choose wisely what you order. I didn't realize the place was SO strict so we started order to our heart's fancy until we realized we were stuck with some unappetizing rolls. Now onto the food, the sashimi and fish are actually pretty good. They give you hearty cuts of their daily specials and stand alone are really great if you're a raw fish kind of person. As somebody who loves Japanese food and sashimi, I'm usually never a fan of sushi rolls because they're usually very Americanized and filled with cream cheese or fried or underfilled (the worst) or over-riced. Sadly, I felt like the sushi rolls we ordered (like 4-5) all fell short and was guilty of one or many of the adjectives I mentioned above. Because we had over-ordered, the end of our meal wasn't very pleasant but I think had we been smart with our orders, this place would have been amazing. Definitely go with the sashimis and raw fish and limit your roll order. Their salmon and yellowtail were great but please skip the sweet shrimp (kind of inedible and super slimy and tiny and the shrimp head was way over fried and actually gross). Also, Hamachi Kama is one of my favorite things to have at Japanese joints but theirs was extremely over cooked and had a very very fishy smell which was kind of concerning. (Granted, I did not get sick after eating here so I guess it's fine.) But overall, if you stick to their highlights and stay away from certain things (mentioned above), this place is still very worth the price and can be really great!",

Surprisingly the food against the reasonable price for buffet and made by non-Japanese was not too bad that I thought.  All food were not made ahead. Ordered what I wanted and then they would make them so that sushi were not dried out and hard.  Usually at most buffet restaurants, sushi will come with lots of rice but small piece of fish. However Sakana didn't make huge portion of rice for sushi  and they even put big slice of fish on rice. Therefore I could have 9 orders = 18 pieces of sushi and 9 orders of small kitchen dishes. Yellowtail, Uni, Oyster, Amaebi Sweet Shrimp with deep fried head & shell, Salmon  Kama, and Sesame pudding were good to me.",

If you're willing to risk having diarrhea and vomiting while you're in Vegas, by all means give this place a shot.   That aside, the food was actually pretty good especially the flavoring but I'm not sure about the freshness of the sushi. I enjoyed the meal and the buffet was a good value. I'd rate this place a 4-5 stars if no one was sick. But when it comes to sushi, freshness and your health are the number one priority.   If you really want to go there, maybe sit closer to the bar and look at the fish quality and watch how they handle your food first. Also it's always safer to stick with hot food. Their agedashi tofu was good. One order came with 3 pieces and I had 2 orders of those.   Service was good too. It's really too bad the 3 of us got sick. I was hoping this would be our regular spot in Vegas. Nope. Not a chance.",

We were told that they no longer offer the dinner option for lunch even if we are willing to pay for it! Wow, talk about being harsh and creating new rules to make it inconvenient.   We stayed because we already sat down. Ordered a bunch of sushi to share and the fish to rice ratio has significantly diminished over time. The fish slices are very thin now, unlike it used to be. Our orders were messed up several times, and so we had to re-order. Also got a couple of rolls and they were overloaded with mayonnaise and sweet sauce that it tasted horrible and just swimming in sauce. The pork belly was stiff and overcooked!   Lunch $21.95, dinner $25.95. There are so many other AYCE joints within a mile radius that has better quality food and treats customers better. It's very disappointing this place is gone totally downhill. I will NEVER come back again!!!!",

I walked in thinking it shouldn't differ much from the one I usually went to but I was wrong ! They sushi and all the rolls are seriously next level, the Fish to rice ratio is perfect perfect just like what I had back in Japan, the rolls I ordered were all really really tasty ! The minute I put in \" Jalapeno Bomb\", \" Monkey Brain\", \" Playboy\" in my mouth I literally said \" omg I want to cry\" THEY ARE REALLY DELICIOUS ! After sushi I had some dessert, again - very very good dessert too! couldn't be happier that I decided to try new restaurant and that I find this hidden gem sitting in this desert waiting for us to discover !!",

The reason for huge gap between my first and second visit is because of the drive from where I live! Plus, there have been plenty of other sushi places to try out. The sushi here was delicious, the fish was fresh and I definitely recommend trying some of the appetizers (especially \"the shit\"). The baked rolls are also amazing, it's always a good feeling to eat warm rolls. I had to fight for the last piece when I ate here with my brother! The customer service is good! There was a waiter who was extremely friendly, but I do not remember his name. He was funny, attentive, entertaining, and overall just enhanced my experience. I'll be sure to make the effort to come more often!",

Usually good quality all you can eat sushi costs upwards of 30 dollars per person, but this was actually some of the best sushi I've had in the states. We basically worked our way through all the nigiri so I can confidently tell you that each one was fresh and well portioned with perfectly cooked sushi rice, most of the time I skipped the soy sauce because it was so flavorful already. The wait time for lunch wasn't long on a Sunday so that was surprising as well. One thing I would suggest is to avoid the dishes marked with *must try* or *highly recommended*, not because they weren't good but because they're strategically selected filler foods. Basically just foods to get you full. The rolls were good quality as well but honestly they fill you up too quickly. The best way to get your money's worth is to try all the nigiri and add in a couple of your favorite appetizers. Dessert is a must too! I got the honey toast and it was well portioned and the perfect end to the meal.",

Well, simply all you can eat sushi is not recommended generally speaking, and its poor selection and robot made like sushi is just out of discussion.    This place, however, four sushi chefs are working so hard like humming bird and you can eat premium such as uni, amaebi, fatty salmon too on top of regular one and appetizers (those premiums are one order only though).  After you try all others, one time premium sushi is just fine for me.   Fifth star could be by adding some basic selection I usually can find such as Aji or Kohada, and due to the speedy preparation, the rice isn't treated well sometimes.  Fall apart before you put it in mouth...  But you don't get all at the price, right?   The price is without drink.  All menu food items are included! I'm happy to go there again.",

Set in a strip mall near the UNLV campus, Sakana loads their guests up with fish without stuffing them with rice.  Every roll, sashimi and special on the menu is available for their AYCE special -- although some of the stand-out items like Uni are \"one time only\" per meal. That's fair enough. It's always a battle for these places to keep the prices down and the quality up.  Stand-out dishes for this meal: ocean trout, poke tower, seafood salad, uni, the \"Batman roll.\"  Service is LIGHTNING quick -- even when they're packed. (Which is basically all the time.)",

I had asked the waitress when they started renovating and she told me that this was no longer Kabuki, it was now Sakana.  I was sad at first when I heard Kabuki was gone, but I was willing to give Sakana a chance.  Since Sakana was still going through the process of renovating, I noticed a few differences in some of the art hung up and a new flat TV playing K-Pop and American music videos.  As for the food, my husband and I were throughly impressed.  We decided to get the AYCE sushi for the dinner price of $22.95 (lunch is $20.95).  The waitress asked us if we wanted to add the All You Can Drink for an extra $3 (!).  We had to opt out, but its ok, next time!  Anyways we mainly ate nigiri, like Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, etc.  They were all succulent and quite fresh!  I liked how there were sauces for some of the nigiri because they each complimented their fish.  We tried to order Uni (Sea Urchin), but a sushi chef (head chef maybe?) came up to us in person to apologize that he couldn't get it shipped in this week because his supplier had told him the Uni weren't fresh due to weather conditions.  We were totally ok with that and both thought it was thoughtful of him to come over and tell us that.    So to all you sushi lovers out there, come over to Sakana... Their food is definitely worth trying!",

It's also near UNLV so I'm about it when I'm around campus and craving quality sushi. It's a 5 star place for me but I have to give it 4 because the last time I came here, it was a quick get in and get out sushi session due to one of their air conditioning was down so it was a little warm, especially during the summer! I usually like staying in sushi bars long for a good intellectual conversation, but I was saddened by this one time experience.   It's okay though because I'll update on this the next time I go and see if it's improved by then.  The waiters/waitresses were decent and took our orders quickly. The chefs (at the bar) were always aware of our orders and got them to us quickly as well, even when it was busy.  I'd have to say the sushi was fresh and impressively portioned. I don't like having that much rice in my nigiri but they definitely go the portioning perfect! Big fresh fish cuts on a good enough amount of rice! I'm into nigiris so it was pretty bomb compared to other sushi places! I just wished they had wasabi and ginger prepared without asking, and also a personal plate to put your sushi on  I'm also a fan of their authentic Japanese decor. It's cute and relaxing, just good enough for a sushi restaurant. The area was clean as well as their bathroom. and there was enough space to get around so it doesn't feel too crowded and close together.  If you're looking for some good quality sushi and service, this place is a good spot! It's around the corner from target on Maryland and Flamingo (also near Tiabi Waffles). It's a private parking lot so it shouldn't be hard to find a parking space unless the restaurants are packed.  Overall, great place but I wished they'd fixed their air conditioning.",

With their prices just right, their drinks keep flowing, the fish is OH so fresh, and then the staff being so awesome! You just can't go wrong.  It's a little hard to find, nestled in on the right hand side of Target, but its worth looking for!   I have found my new Sushi spot!",

The first place that popped up was sakana having an astonishing 4.5 stars rating! I thought it was a must try out. So good it exceeded my expectations! The sushi is amazing! The price is cheap compared to vegas standards and the house seems a legit japanese restaurant. The no rice options are soooo goood!  I would totally recommend and  come back again and again and again...",

    "text": "Stop you've reached your destination and you no longer have to search for the best AYCE sushi that Sin City has to offer.  Rolls - The rolls here are amazing and are crafted with expert precision. Each roll is dressed in an unique sauce that truly complements the accompanying fish. Thankfully the chefs dont stuff the rolls full of fillers or rice.  Nigiri - Fresh and truly enjoyable to sample and once again the fish is generously portioned over a small rice pillow. My fiance and I truly love to indulge in the following: salmon belly, yellowtail belly, albacore 300, yuzu yellowtail, uni (1 order of 2 pieces per person), and if they have it, the albacore belly.  Appetizers - the towering poki nachos (awesome!), baked mussels (sweet, moist and plump), miso soup  (comforting) and the jalapeno poppers are a must! Note the exclamation point (I'm yelling at you and that means do it!)  Service - even though they are always busy, you'll never notice as the staff are always checking on you and is never far away as to not notice a simple gesture to call their attention. I really love how everyone here makes you feel special.  Seriously stop searching yelp, you're done! So done. Just get over here and see what makes them different and the best in Vegas.  Cheers,  Renzo M",

Shit...I was thrown piles of shit.    The ONLY reason why I ended up tipping even a little is because of how hard the busboys were working.  They were pretty much the waiter than the actual waiter.

The servers were really nice and thoughtful. The price was incredible given that things like eel and soft shell crab was included. All the fish was fresh tasting and the amount of rice on all the nigiri was not too much. We pretty much tasted all the standard fare with a few exceptions like the salmon skin hand roll which was different than any I had tasted in the past. It was a tad sweet which made it taste unique but really good. We also ended up having 1 of each of the desserts and I think my favorite was the black sesame manger. All in all it was a great experience and would highly recommend anyone in Vegas hit them up for AYCE, it's great tasting and a fantastic deal.",

They all different sizes of tables for small and Big. A+++  Customer Service: It all depends when you go. Some days there are waits where there are big lines and there are some days where there are no waits where you can walk right in and you'll go straight to your seat. Excellent A++!  Vibe: Excellent. They have 2 televisions for entertainment and play R&B and Hip-Hop music at the right volume. A+  Food:  Japanese classic sushi. If you're coming here for the first time I recommend you order the dragon roll and tiger roll. It is very delicious, sweet, and has a great amount. Also try the spicy tuna hand roll. It is very bomb and has a kick to it. A++++  Parking: Parking was a breeze. You're lucky if you can get front roll parking if not they have lot of parking space near by..I give parking an A.  Overall Grade: Sakana gets an A+++++. I recommend coming on any day for the all you can eat lunch and dinner. It's a perfect place to eat at and to know on a date.The Food was delicious.

This place is worth a cab ride and is priced well. On top of that! The sushi is \"da bomb\"!  We ordered a variety of sushi and was not disappointed at all. The baked rolls is one of a kind here. I never had them before and boy are they good. The baked lobster is good along with the playboy! Those are my must try's recommends! Everything else is good too so you cannot go wrong.  The service was also very good. This AYCE is not a buffet, everything is made to order so it is especially fresh when its arrives. The waiters are not stingy and is quick to take your orders and the sushi arrives in less than 5-8 mins. Also, to note... they do charge you the price of the sushi if you don't finish it. So make sure not to order wasteful food! I think it's a great policy given that some people have no manners at AYCE places.  Great sushi and must have when you're in Vegas!",

There was never a moment where we had to look around for our waiter. The sushi was excellent, the rice portion on the nigiri was perfect. Seeing quail eggs as an option was sushi was also a surprise.  We started with agedashi tofu, pork belly and kara-age. The appetizer portions are small, but I think that's great in this case because you can try multiple things without filling up.  They were all very good.   Skewers- we ordered a few. Shrimp, Yakitori and bacon with scallop. They were all good except the bacon was a little bit on the salty side for my taste.   Sushi-We didn't order any rolls so I can't say anything about those. The quality of fish was very good. I really liked their mackerel because they actually give it a quick sear with a torch.  Dessert-I don't recommend the tiramisu. It is kinda dry and dense.  This was an excellent dining experience and we will definitely be back. It was definitely worth the drive. Thank you for your super fast and friendly service!",

I'm glad this AYCE sushi joint isn't one where they have sushi out for people to sneeze on and put their dirty hands all over!   //// ---- How it works: - For $26.95: Order whatever you want, as many times as you want from the waiter - Menu includes appetizers (miso soup, Japchae), skewers, nigiri, tempura rolls, deep fried rolls, classic rolls, no rice rolls and deserts! Whatttt  ///// ---- Would recommend: - getting any rolls with spicy tuna - asking for no sauce (their sauces were either heavy mayo or sweet)  - swapping crab mixes for crab sticks (avoid all the heavy mayo) - skipping the skewers: most too oily, but if I had to pick one - go for the shrimp  - passing on dessert: really wasn't impressed by the mochi or green tea ice cream, but hey it's included haha   //// ---- Tips: - Free small Sapporo for Yelp review - ~5-10 min ride from encore depending on traffic   Would definitely come back. Come early to avoid a wait, great service",

The service was on par and the music and environment were fun.  The selection here is pretty broad, so even if you're not big on seafood like myself, this is an awesome place to test the waters and try something different. Everything we tried was beyond my expectations. My personal favorites were the king lobster roll and Japanese lasagna roll. Of course, save room for dessert too. They're well known for their honey toast and have a yummy selection of ice creams  I can't wait to go again!",

When the sushi is on the place, you can't actually 'see' the rice.   For less than $26 you get uni, salmon belly, oysters, and a plethora of other options. Some of the highlights for me were definitely salmon belly which melts in your mouth, the eel which had the perfect texture and flavoring, the smoked paprika salmon, and honestly everything else.   At no point was their a sushi or roll I thought was bad, or I wouldn't finish. Come here hungry, and you'll definitely leave feeling satisfied and amazed.",

    "text": "I usually love Sakana, but my last experience made me not want to go there again because it's just not worth it. I had not been there in over a year and decided to go with my mom for my birthday.  When we entered, there was no line and plenty of seating. The bar was empty, all empty half-booths to the left, 1 empty booth to the right. My mom had asked for a booth of any side (she's in the late 50's and has back problems), but it was not allowed since we were only a party of two, and they said they were anticipating party of 4's or 6's. There weren't any reservation signs except for the big table in the middle. My mom insisted, but I didn't want to push it because I didn't want to take a chance for bad service.  When we were ordering, my mom had questions about some items. Our server did not know some of the sushi items and admitted he doesn't know much because he doesn't even eat sushi. Really?  Anyway, the meal was good, but not great.The salmon sushi did not taste buttery and delicious like the last times I went. I also was really bummed out that they ran out of plum ice cream. That's my favorite and the main reason I wanted to go to Sakana. I was going to order 5 scoops, too. I settled for honey toast. It was okay.  While I was eating, I noticed a young couple being seated at one of the half-booths on the left. They (the servers) had split a 4-top table for them even though there was an empty 2-top table right behind me. It kinda annoyed me. I only told my mom about it when she was paying, and she was pissed off. We talked to a supervisor about it, and repeated that they were anticipating party of 4 to 6. I didn't get it because the booths were now with groups of 4, but one couple on one of them and an extra empty half-booth for 2. There were more tables for 2, so they were trying to make bad excuses. I didn't want to make a big deal, but I was annoyed because it was my birthday and my mom was really upset and felt discriminated against (the couple was white, we're filipino.) So I rushed my mom out of there, and I'll never look back.",

The next morning he felt even worse and I'm thinking he had food poisoning from those oysters because he hadn't eaten much else all day knowing that we were going to an AYCE sushi restaurant for dinner.   The only things that were decent were the garlic tuna nigiri and the skewers with bacon wrapped asparagus and lobster. The yuzu hamachi was also pretty good. The pricing for the AYCE menu is $25.95 for dinner, which I think is good if you can eat tons of sushi but definitely not the best quality.   Service was terrible. Our waitress (girl with black framed glasses) was not friendly and gave us our check while we were still eating as if she was trying to rush us out. She acted as if she was irritated to take our order each time she came to the table. We ordered hot tea (which we had to pay for) and it never came even with asking for it twice.   This was my first time here and I was very excited to try it out after reading all the great reviews but I won't be returning.",

We were lucky enough to get the last big table. First off, anyone that offers ALL DAY 2 for 1 beer wine and sake is on my favorites list, but that's just the beginning. The AYCE here includes lots of appetizers, salads and soup.   Andy started out as our server and explained the menu, drinks and answered many questions. Since there were 5 of us we were able to sample many of the appetizers, sushi and rolls. We started off with \"the shit\", dragon balls, pork belly, miso soup and chicken fried rice. Everything was delicious, still not sure what was in the shit but it was really good!   Then the feast began. Several orders of the towering poke (Loved these!), yellow tail, spicy tuna, dancing eel, something wrong roll, snow in Vegas, and on and on and on. Kevin took over as our server and made sure we were taken care of just as Andy did. I couldn't believe how much we ate, finally ending with the honey toast with ice cream. All of the sushi was generously cut and super fresh. The rolls were all excellent with the dancing eel and something wrong (the garlic ponzu was amazing) being my favorites. There was never a long wait the food just kept coming and coming despite how busy it was.   the AYCE dinner is now up to $25.95 and desserts are now limited to one each. Still our bill for 5 AYCE and 4 beers only came to $150. We easily ate twice that amount or more. Sakana is definitely worthy of its 5 star reviews and I WILL be back for more!",

The problem is it is right next to the UNLV campus so expect a fairly long line/wait.  The service was so nice!

Very little rice below a big piece of fish! Yum!!!! All their dipping sauces were yummy. They even allowed us to order \"half-rolls\" which was 4 to an order vs 8! Big plus. That allowed us to try other stuff without being stuffed trying to finish the whole 8 piece. This will be our go-to spot when we return to Vegas!   You must try:  Ocean trout - one order per person (melt in your mouth delicious) Garlic tuna  Yellowtail yuzu  Salmon lemon (Above are nigiri)  Hamachi kama  Baked mussels Baked lobster roll   Skip:  Japchae Bulgogi nachos The shit  I can't wait to come back to try other stuff. They have a wide variety of items to try!!",

Update June 2017 - Had not been here in 6 months because I was out of the country and just came back today and this place is hands down the best sushi place in Vegas. It looks like they renovated the interior and exterior of the place so the ambiance got nicer. The food quality if top notch. Seriously recommend this place!",

The menu can get a bit overwhelming to decide to order because you just want to eat with your eyes.

The experience wasn't as great as some of the other people rating on here for several reasons:  We got more orders of the same thing than we actually ordered. For example, if we ordered 1 order of Golden California Roll, we would get 2. This happened more than once. And when we asked the server about it, she told us that we in fact did order (but when she let us see our order paper, it wasn't even marked). There were also orders we did that we never received. I am not sure what was the issue since we split our group into two separate ordering parties, it shouldn't have been that confusing!  Any roll that would generally taste sweet, were way too sweet here. Left us wondering if it's a Japanese restaurant styled to cater to American sweet tooth. The raw sushi also wasn't as good or as fresh as one of the sushi joints I frequent in California either (@ a fraction of the price). Like, the salmon LOOKED fatty, but it didn't...taste fatty.  Weird experience for me.",

All you can eat for $26.95 and 2 for 1 beer & sake specials. We dove into the sushi. No rolls for us. Too much rice in an AYCE setting is no good. We were pleasantly surprised at the speed of sushi service. The quality/flavor of the fish was also spot on. No complaints from two suspicious sushi eaters. I would have given the place 5 stars if they sat us much quicker. The sushi bar was half empty for 15 minutes until we asked a second time to sit at the bar.",

He even forgot my order at one point. When we ordered our 2nd round, I tried to hand him 3 empty platters to clear our table myself & he just kept walking away.  I swear he disappeared for about 15 minutes while my entire table just sat looking around the restaurant for him.  I really really wanted to like this place.

    "text": "Went back to Sakana on a second visit with a group of sushi lovers. Seems the name is no longer Sakana but changed to Kabuki & they are under new management. No lit signage to tell where the restaurant is from the outside so that's a downfall to new people coming here as it can be a bit tricky to find.   We ordered many rolls which seemed to be too over sauced to actually taste any fish on many of them. Best one was Japanese Nachos & Salmon Loves Lemon. Also seemed that more than 1/2 the rolls on the menu were spicy something another. There were a lot of baked or deep fried rolls which I am not a fan of. Ordered lots of nigiri as well. Do have to say that the portion of fish to rice was fairly decent as it wasn't too much rice & a nice thinner longer piece of fish. Fish seemed ok for the most part but it just was not as good as when I visited the original time.   Service was ok but seemed 1 the waitresses that were taking orders for our table did not want was there. Felt like she was rushing us & a few times when I asked to get nigiri that was missing she triple questioned if I had gotten it instead of just going & placing an order. Had to reassure her that I had not received particular order of missing item.   I would have given this place a solid 3 stars because food was decent but not as good as the original time when I was there (when it was called Sakana) & so/so service. But they get 1 star for the fact that when I used the restroom there was a huge cock roach crawling on the floor. Ugh. Felt sick to my stomach seeing that after just have eaten the raw fish. Bathroom was also very dirty & no toilet paper on the roll. I will not be going back. And it's such a shame as I was such a fan after the 1st visit.",

We've been to several local sushi places and one think Sakana stands out for is their fish to rice ratio. The fish is always generous and the rice is minimal. It's greatly appreciated when AYCE doesn't overkill on the rice to fill the customers up.  My ONLY suggestion is that they invest in a fountain soda system. For customers it is much more appreciated when we can pay one price for bottomless sodas. It's a benefit to the establishment as well as customers consume less when their tummies are full of soda. Win-win situation for all!",

I went to the bathroom before sitting down and, low and behold, there was a humungous cockroach staring back at me while I was peeing! Ew  My friend and I both got the AYCE dinner for $22.95 and the appetizer labeled \"THE SHIT! must try,\" which was more shitty than the shit in my opinion. My friend really liked it though. We also got the 2-for-1 sapporo deal, which was pretty awesome because we got 2 huge bottles that was enough to fill 4 cups.   The sashimi salad was hooked up with sashimi, which is good because I don't like eating a bunch of rice at AYCE places, as it gets me unnecessarily full. I also ordered salmon, yellowtail, and albacore sashimi, which all tasted pretty fresh, but definitely not the best fish. Really thin slices too. The sashimi roll was good too, stuffed with assorted raw fish and rapped in cucumber (no rice). My friend ordered a spicy crab roll (basically a california roll but with spicy crab), monster roll, baked lobster roll, and baked scallop roll, which were all pretty good.   This place kinda smelled like clorox, but it wasn't anything too overbearing.",

Although there were several open tables, we were stuck waiting. Service is terrible too. The sushi was terrible. It tasted like it has been out all day and no one wanted it. Overall, everything was terrible.  Food?  It came out pretty fast... Like lightning fast. But I rather get struck by lightning than eat this lightning fast food. I was gagging due to the terrible taste of each roll. It tasted rotten and terrible. The spicy rolls tasted salty, sour and bitter at the same time. I did not even expect that to be possible. It did not taste spicy. It took all my strength to continue chewing. It took half a cup of water to down each roll. It got harder and harder as we went along. At first, I was wondering how I can get rid of the rolls without paying or eating them. But it got to the point where my boyfriend and I just had enough. I was willing to pay EXTRA to not have to finish the rolls. I didn't want them anywhere near me anymore.   Cost? Pretty cheap but for each roll you fail to eat, they'll charge you extra. Bail out on the rice? Charged for the rice you skipped over on. I'll accept the lost over the torture.  Service? Waitress.. Are you even trying? I left the tip but it was more for the gentleman than you.   TMI. Read if you are willing to. My boyfriend has terrible diarrhea from the food. After 3 times, he still isn't done. My stomach is uncomfortable and I feel like my food is about to come out of both ends. At least if I ever come back to Vegas, I know to never come back to this restaurants.",

    "text": "One of only two(that I know of) TRUE All-You-Can-Eat sushi joints in town, and possibly the cheapest price in town, Sakana is a solid contender in the AYCE sushi arena.  After reading highly rated reviews yet again by fellow yelpers, we had to check Sakana out for ourselves, and we are glad we did! We came in for lunch and sat up at the bar with Chef Sai who is very personable and funny, yet passionate about his sushi. We had called ahead of time and asked what the difference between the lunch price ($20.95) and the dinner price ($22.95) was...they don't offer some items at lunch as they do for dinner so just do yourself a favor and go all in, pay the dinner price, and KILL IT!!!!  Appetizers, Rolls, Nigiri, Dessert....besides the standard one per person Uni and Amaebi(which automatically comes with a fried head) As much as you want, as much as you can put away-half rolls too, so you can try different ones the fish quality was great,(Of course, the top tier fish are found at Kabuto, Yonaka, and Yummy Grill at W Lake Mead) and I especially like that for the Uni nigiri, you get the entire roe! That is something that Chef Sai is proud about, and from him being able to select the ingredients straight from the source, that's what allows him to charge these amazingly low prices.  The fish to rice ratio is pretty awesome too. I'd say he uses no more than oh.......about 50 grains of rice per nigiri, so you can enjoy the fish without the rice overkill. Everything we had was very tasty! Sakana also offers a good variety of appetizers, salads, and other side dishes that are worth a try too. Chef Sai has definitely done his homework and dined at the competitors around town to see how he can stand out from the rest of them. Although we stuck mostly to nigiri and appetizers, we tried the Sashimi Roll which was very artfully  presented, and was very delicious. Chef Sai also gave us a Pink Scallop that was in the shell and presented with mango salsa and ponzu which was on his specials board. I had room for half a roll more before dessert, so I asked Chef Sai to make me a half roll of anything he wanted to make it with, so it was shrimp tempura and crab in the center, wrapped with maguro and hamachi topped with red onion and ponzu I tried looking for it on the menu, but I couldn't find it...(it was a custom roll) \"Which one is this one?\" I asked. He replied  \"It's the which one is this one roll..LOL!!!\" Good times with Chef Sai!  Desserts are pretty good here too. The Plum Ice Cream is delicious and so is the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. If we are ever in the area again and a craving hits, we will most definitely be back!   ALOHA!!!",

After singing happy birthday half heartily, the waiter kept saying he will charge us for leftovers and how much for each leftover. Honestly, we didn't even order that much but their some rolls were so sweet and drenched with sauce, it was a bit gross. And chicken fried rice so so. How are we supposed to know if we don't order what we know already if it'll taste good? I felt like we were obligated to eat bad or mediocre food that we ordered. This time, only half of our food was good. But food tasted really greasy on some flavors. Forgotten orders is common here. Oh, I also got bad diarrhea afterwards. A worst birthday dinner ever. I wonder if everyone studies their brain out on some 100 menus and love everything to finish everything on plates. Otherwise, be prepared to pay for leftovers.",

They took forever to take our order and our food took forever to arrive. Our food came out so slow, each order took at least 20 minutes before another one came out. The waiter didn't even ask us how our food was or checked up on us, we had to keep calling him back if we wanted anything. The worst part is that there was barely anyone in the restaurant! Had only 6 orders and we had to cancel our last one because we were there for almost 2 hours! I had to storm up to them in order to ask for my check because they would not get it to me fast enough. Kept ignoring me when I tried to flag them down. Never ever coming here again! Would never recommend this place. Ridiculous how we came in first and our order took forever, yet another group came after us and got their all their food before us even though they had ordered more than us. Would never recommend this place to anyone.",

Nestled in a target parking lot in an area that would seem suspect you'd least expect to find a sushi place as great as this! The super white tuna is delicious and they throw in their own special seasoning to bring out a unique flavor. Appetizers are great and I recommend trying \"the shit.\" Don't ask what it's made of but it's delicious! The sushi portions are great and I like how they do not add a ton of rice to get you full. Service is a little on the slow end especially on their busy nights when they appear understaffed. I'd give this place 5 starts but they don't offer all you can eat dessert....",

    "text": "I would never ever come here again. The food was definitely not 4.5 stars and the service was so incompetent!!  I came here with 5 other friends around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately in the corner of the restaurant. 5 of us did the AYCE and 1 person ordered a la carte, which was accommodating of them. We waited for what seemed like forever for our server to come by to order. We had to physically go get someone to come take our order, but then when he did come, he just gave us a checklist sheet. Why did you not just give that to us when you sat us down?? So by the time we finished checking off our orders, we flagged someone ELSE down to take our order sheet.  Then someone else came by to take our appetizer order. We ordered the shishito peppers, the poke tower, the SHIT (because they said its a must try), agedashi tofu, baked mussels, and oysters. They ran out of salmon kama, but they had hamachi kama, which was fine. But only HALF of our orders showed up....little did we know that this would be the pattern for the night. The oysters were lukewarm when they got to us andm did not taste very fresh because of that. The poke tower was not bad. The SHIT was spicy crab wrapped in seaweed (not nori) and tempura fried served with spicy mayo - it was salty and not spectacular. The baked mussels were probably the only appetizer we liked.  While waiting for our sushi to come, the servers kept bringing us the wrong order or stuff we didnt order. This must have happened at least 3 times. Seriously?  What the heck...  After what seemed like forever, we finally started getting our sushi, but they were horrible with the coordination! We'd get a plate with 6 nigiri, and then wait another 5 minutes for more food to come. It was like this ALL night. The salmon nigiri was basic, but the cut of tuna left it dry and not palatable at all. I had the Chanel roll, which was ok if they didnt drench it in sauce. We ordered mackerel by accident, but since it was AYCE, we felt bad for sending it back. So we ate it out of AYCE courtesy, but the mackerel was obviously not good. They drenched it in their house sauce and a ton of lemons. You know fish is not fresh when they have to cover their nigiri in sauces. Finally, at the 1 hour mark, all our food came at once. At this point, we were not in the mood to eat anymore! The 6 orders of white tuna nigiri we ordered finally came at the end, but they screwed it up and gave us their 'super tuna', which is basically white tuna in their house sauce. We thought, maybe we ordered the wrong thing again...so we flagged someone down and order just 1 order of white tuna. And when it came, it was their 'super tuna' again! We stared at the plate when it came and just thought, \"Are you kidding me??\" At that point, we were just tired of arguing with the staff. We ate it. The fish might have been good if they didnt drench it in sauce...  Finally, we ask for the check, and they were nice enough to split for us. But then when we got our cards back, the one friend who didn't do AYCE was charged twice by mistake, but they caught it, voided it, and informed us about it. But upon closer inspection, she had charged her the AYCE price, when her check only came out to be $9 since half her orders never even came out!!! This place only gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the woman who messed up the checks was so sweet about it and they were attentive about refilling our water - obviously I'm being generous. To add insult to injury, because we were a larger party, they added the 18% gratuity automatically to our checks, which I never mind, except service was...UGH....never again.",

I like their summer crunch and baked lobster. Also I love thier nigiries, cuz the fish part is really thick. For those who love dessert, I really recommend this place because here is no limitation about dessert! (Seriously this is very important to me.) All these are only 22.95 for dinner, so there's no reason not to try.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are in search of a good AYCE sushi joint, after moving from California. We've eaten at most of the AYCE Sushi joints here in Las Vegas, but this one has got to be the worst one by far. Walking into the restaurant, we were greeted with a lousy Hello, after the server came to talk to the party of four who by the looks of it were waiting a while as they asked if they could just sit at the bar with their kids. The server never asked how many were in our party, although we were told to write our name down on a list, he never once looked at. The restaurant was not busy. And as a server, I know busy. Also my boyfriend and I were the only ones waiting. We look around the room and there's clearly seats for where we can be placed. (There's a two-seater right in front of me.) Patience. We wait. 15 min. We get seated to the exact same two-seater that's been vacant since we got there. The server comes to our table asking what we want to drink, and takes our drink order as he's walking off to do another task. Why was he in such a hurry when he only had 3 tables to serve. Water, took 10 min to come. Because he was in such a hurry, our Beer came out wrong. Orders sent to the wrong table. Extra ginger took about 10 min. A different server had to come and take our order because our server was too busy doing who knows what. And on top of what, my boyfriend wasn't even finished with his food, but our servers hand was already on the plate to bus. Seriously?   Although service was horrible the rice to fish ratio was good. They get 1.5 stars from me because food came out fast and it was fresh although they drown their fish in too much sauce for my liking.   I guess our server, Jason, was just too busy with his 3 tables that he was just too busy to place his two feet down next to our table without moving just for a couple of seconds to ask if everything was okay.   I will never be going back.",

The sushi only have 1/3 rice or less compare to other sushi restaurants, even those expensive ones. BE HAPPY roll is the best roll/sushi we ever had.

On top of the delicious food the service was just superb. They were incredibly attentive, answering questions and coming back between plates to have us place another order so that we were never waiting more than a few minutes for something new to come out. You could see every time they walked through they would look over and check to make sure we were doing okay.   Fantastic experience, can't wait to try it again!",

You can't go wrong to a sushi buffet. $20.99 lunch and $24.99 for dinner ITS WORTH IT!!!! Food is very delicious and tasty. First time trying it today w/ my bf and gaaadddddd we're definitely going back! I personally compute the amount of sushi we order if it wasn't $20 man we'll be paying $67. Lol I highly recommend LOBSTER ROLL, SUMMER CRUNCH, BE HAPPY, JACKPOT ROLL, SOMETHING WRONG ROLL & GOLDEN TIGER. I guarantee you your money won't go to waste. It's a must try place.    There's only two things that hold me giving them 5 Stars drinks aren't refillable (that's really disappoints me, that's why it's called buffet) they will give you soda can and the bathroom is really a NO NO!!!! Stinky as hell and dirty. Other than food is really good.",

The sushi has larger fish with smaller size rice (so they wont feed u with lots of rice in this buffet deal).    We really enjoyed it!!  We definitely would love to be back next time.",

Used to love that place but when we went in it felt wrong, had to wait 25 mins on a Tuesday night, and were stuck in a tiny back corner.

There were at least 3 servers but it seemed like they were avoiding our table. One of servers actually walked by so fast that he kicked the back of my chair and tripped. No apology and no acknowledgment that we were trying to get a server's attention. When we finally made eye contact with a server, he put up his finger for us to wait. It took another 5 minutes for him to come to our table. The fish quality was a little off that night. Hit or miss at this place.  Considering my already low expectations of ayce sushi, I was still disappointed with this place.  Good thing parking was ample and no wait during Sunday dinner time.",

    "text": "I came here the other day because I heard such great reviews about this place. Now, the fish to rice ratio is pretty awesome!   Once we entered the restaurant, a waiter took our order for appetizers. He then brought out a paper where we would fill it out and write how many pieces of nigiri, rolls, and other items. I swear that we ordered fewer nigiri than showed up, but they never gave me the paper back,   The service is pretty fast. Our sushi just kept coming and coming and coming.  At one point, one of the servers asked if we still wanted our yuzu yellowtail because we had so much food on the table. The servers kept coming by and asking us if everything was alright. They gave us our check once we ordered dessert, but then they took forever to take payment. It was like they stopped checking up on us after then.   They only allow 1 order per person of the specials which including the screaming o, salmon belly, avocado bomb, and mango salmon. I was bit sad that they only offered 1 order of salmon belly person. The shrimp came with huge fried shrimp on the side, and it only came with one shrimp per order. It was also only one order of ocean trout.   One of the things I didn't like was the different sauces that they put on top. I would rather just eat the fish by itself.   Now, some of the information on yelp has changed. Out of green tea panna cotta, black sesame dessert, mochi, fried bananas, tempura ice cream, and mini honey toast, you could only pick one which bummed me out because that's my favorite part. I believe they allow unlimited ice cream or at least they didn't have a limit on it. The oysters are seasonal, so they didn't have any. They no longer serve soft shell crab.  They do offer 2 for 1 alcoholic. My friends ordered a yogurt soju. The soju was pretty good, but the drink size was pretty small. That's probably why it's such a deal!",

I like the appetizers that they have here because there are many different types. I personally like the fried rice and the bacon wrapped sticks, it's super good. The price is definitely worth it. The cool thing about this place is, it's not by rounds and just more upon, what you want at anytime. I've been to many places where they do it by rounds and I didn't like that.

All in all, I highly recommend their nigiri. Their fish quality is so yummy and fresh and great rice to fish ratio. No fishy taste (except for mackerel so avoid getting that) and the rice is just right amount of vinegar, sugar, temperature, and stickiness! If you're not a fan of heavy mayo in your foods then I'd stay away from most rolls and appetizers lol  Appetizers  Bulgogi nachos: 4/5 this was a pretty good. It was heavy on the cheese and sweet mayo so it's pretty creamy if you're into that.The bulgogi in it is nothing special.  \"The shit\": 3/5 this was literally a deep fried California roll but without the rice lol lots of sriracha mayo inside but it was crispyyyyy  Spicy edamame: 3/5 has a pretty spicy kick and quite oily  Poke tower: 3/5 way too much mayo in this on top of tortilla chips. It was pretty much sriracha mayo topped tuna on top of crisps. At this point we had too many things with mayo, I was quite overthis lol  Baked mussel: 3/5 mussels were so tiny, there was nothing much to bite and it was mostly mayo and a little masago.   Nigiri Lemon salmon: 5/5 salmon was so fresh and lemon taste was just enough to complement the smoothness of the salmon.  Salmon belly: 5/5 so fatty, it melts in your mouth Super white tuna: 5/5 my fav of the night! I could eat this forever, it was silky smooth but wasn't tiring to eat like salmon after a while. Highly recommend this.  Garlic tuna: 4/5 tuna is fresh and garlic isn't too strong  Cajun salmon: 4/5 Smokey taste to it, quite unique Mackerel: 2/5 was so fishy and already cooked. Don't get  Uni:3/5 this was a hit or miss. Some pieces were so creamy and fresh. Other pieces were bitter and GROSS  Raw shrimp: 3/5 I feel like this is an acquired taste. It has a gummy texture and kind of mushy.   Dessert Green tea: 2/5 pass on this. Literally tastes like vanilla with green food coloring. Fake green tea Tiramisu: 5/5 coffee cake was soooo yummy. Just the right of sweetness to contrast the bitterness of the coffee. Comes with whip cream!  Deep fried banana: 2/5 you could barely taste the banana. I thought This was a weird combo. Pass.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner Friday night, arriving at around 5:30pm. The restaurant was already pretty full, although we were seated pretty quickly. We opted for the AYCE, which was $25.95 per person. There is a good selection of sushi and appetizers, as well as a whole page of rolls. For sushi we ordered:  Garlic tuna Salmon Seared lemon salmon Albacore Super white tuna Cajun tuna Surf clam Tamago Sarada lobster Ocean trout Salmon belly Oyster Uni Ama ebi  For the rolls, we ordered  No. 1 chef roll Something wrong roll A little tease roll  For some sushi we had multiple orders (each order comes with two pieces), such as the white tuna. All the fish was very fresh, the cuts generous. The best were the salmon belly, white tuna, garlic tuna, and tomago. The uni and oyster were also very fresh according to my wife. The rolls were not as good, the soft shell crab in the middle was cold and somewhat chewy, definitely not freshly cooked.  The sushi is fresh and were I to come here again, I would stick with sushi. The rolls were not good, but to be fair we only tried three. We didn't try the sashimi salad, appetizers, or any of the hand rolls. One more complaint: we ordered chicken skewer, Kara age, and white rice for our son, and it took over 40 minutes to arrive, and only after several reminders and no apologies for taking so long. Our waiter was either absent minded or too busy, as he told us we got our orders twice even though we didn't.   Overall we liked the freshness of the sushi, and would probably come back again to try other rolls and the hand rolls (my personal favorites).",

    "text": "Who would've thought that most buffets along the Las Vegas strip closed earlier than the time my parents go to bed?  That's right folks. Contrary to what my girlfriend and I previously thought, many of the popular buffets in Sin City are NOT 24 hours - at least not without a pass. We unfortunately came to this realization on the last night of our quick trip to Vegas. It was 730pm at night, and all the \"good\" options we found closed at around 9 or 930. Ain't gonna come last minute for some scraps yo!   And so consequently, we scrambled around like eggs trying to find an alternative place that offered some semblance of an \"all you can eat\" (AYCE) experience. Our search brought us to Sakana, an AYCE sushi bar that was just outside the strip (about 5 minutes driving distance along Flamingo Road). Fortunately, we had a car and this place was open until midnight, so we hightailed it there.  Despite the plethora of positive reviews (over 1k), we were able to park right in front of the restaurant and get a seat almost immediately. This was great, since we wanted to catch the last showing of the Mirage Casino's Volcano show. Like with all AYCE sushi restaurants, a flat fee ($26 for dinner) got us an unlimited helping of the many appetizers, desserts, sushi rolls, and nigiri that this place had to offer. Compared to a lot of sushi joints we've been to though, Sakana served plenty of unique items such as their Bulgogi Nacho, Dancing Eel Roll, and The $hit??? What also made this restaurant stand out was that we didn't have to pencil our orders down on a piece of paper; usually, this would restrict us to only 3 rounds of sushi, but here it was truly \"unlimited.\"   We ended up getting a wide assortment of items, and overall it wasn't too bad. Everything came out REAL QUICK - like SPEEDY FAST - and we loved the abundance of cultural decor that made Sakana feel very welcoming. Very chill place with hilariously funny menu items (e.g. \"I Love My A$$\"). In terms of the food, I would recommend sticking to the appetizers and the nigiri, as the sushi rolls were just so-so. Here are some of our highlights and lowlights:  - Burning Your Ass Roll: Loved the garlic ponzu sauce but that was about it. Wasn't really that spicy, the salmon was just okay, and we felt like the rice was WAY TOO SOGGY.  - Lemon Salmon Roll: Same with the lemon roll. Because of the soggy rice, the lemon only exacerbated the wetness. A bit much for us, although the avocado was good and fresh.  + Ocean Trout: Had the look and texture of salmon but tasted so much better! It probably had to be the garlic ponzu sauce.   + The $hit: Very welcome surprise! If we had this first, we'd definitely order it again and again. Super crispy, loved the filling, and the sauce was perfect.   + Green Tea Panna Cotta: Definitely great for people who enjoy a gelatinous dessert. The matcha was very strong with this one, and I loved that it was made in-house.   Overall, I'd say that Sakana wasn't a bad place for AYCE sushi. I've definitely had much better but I thought we made a good choice compared to eating some junk food along the strip. I give this place a \"Tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating.  Eat well and prosper,",

It's cozy & super cute with so many fun little touches.  2. The service is always on point. 3. The sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have you ever thought to yourself this piece of fish is too big for this little wad of rice? This place spoils you! Most all you can eat places don't believe in this philosophy & gyp you on all the good stuff.   There are so many great menu items here & the options are endless. Some of my favorites are -  Super white (check out the HUGE cuts) Scallop sushi Unagi sushi Uni!!!!!!!!! Wet dream The shit (spicy & sweet goodness) Pang (on toast! Amazing!) Mistake roll Garlic tuna sushi Orange blossom roll (refreshing) Popcorn lobster roll  And hands down my favorite item - monkey brains! * two words, banana tempura :)  Also, the mini honey toast is the perfect way to end your meal here.  For any sushi lovers this is the place to try! Expect to wait to be seated & just know that it's totally worth it :)",

I can't stand 90% of the ayce locations in Vegas because they overload their sushi with rice. At sakana, not only do they use quality ingredients but there is a nice balance of rice. I have to say the garlic tuna and yellowtail are my favorite.  So how's the service? Every time I go there it's prompt and friendly! Love this place when I'm feeling ayce.  Update: this place is lit, they have free drinks for reviewers!! Write a review and enjoy a free bottle of soju for a good time with a good lady, my baby :)",

We love food and wanted to try something then our normal Goyemon, Oyshi, or Sushi Mon spots. I had the same choices that the yelped had and a few nigiri pieces.  It tasted so fresh; ) I was indifferent with the Monkey Brains and stuck to half orders of the rolls.  Since I tried most of the Yelpers choices and nigiri I totally agree with them.  I was not a fan of Monkey Brains and the Popcorn lobster roll though.  I definitely suggest if you want dessert, it's only 1 choice not all you can eat. I had the tempura ice cream. It was not too sweet and battered like some sushi restaurants and just the right small size. I would definitely cone back again!",

For instance, they have music playing in the background and the dining area is not as cramped.  The sushi is better and the AYCE price is on par with similar establishments.  I did not like that they have can soda with no refills.  Get a fountain machine, it is 2017!  I took a star away for the service; sure it was pleasant, but I felt a little rushed and the server was \"friendly enough\".  I visited with out of town guests and will definitely be back in the future.  My guests enjoyed the food as well.",

It wasn't the best quality sushi that you could possibly get and it wasn't the absolute worse either and it was cheaper than yama which can get very pricey.   The staff was not the best but also not the worst either.  There have been so many changes that have been made. the woman manager or owner was always super nice though. she once gave me and my friends some free sushi because we would go pretty frequently. The quality of the fish has drastically improved and the quality of the sushi rolling also. I noticed that this place has become more popular over recent months which is really cool thing to witness for this business.   I do not eat sushi very often because of the prices but this place is a good spot to grab a quick roll or two!",

    "text": "For my 400th review: sushi - that seems like a lot since I've only been Yelping for a little bit over a year. One of my favorite things is sushi and here's a new place to try.  I went here with a group of Yelpers (thanks Tony!). Signage still says Kabuki and even the tea cups still say Kabuki as well. It's easy to miss if you didn't know this place exists. It's in the Target complex on Maryland and Flamingo.  We tried a bunch of nigiri, rolls, desserts, etc. My favorites out of everything we tried were pink scallops, sashimi salad, salmon belly nigiri, wasabi tobiko nigiri, unagi nigiri, soft-shell crab, black sesame manger, plum ice cream and green tea Panna cotta.  The pink scallops were fresh and topped with roe. Sashimi salad has shrimp tempura, tuna and salmon. Salmon belly nigiri was nice and fatty. Wasabi tobiko was pretty and yummy. Unagi was nice and smokey. Uni is served differently here. The rice isn't wrapped in nori with the uni on top. I've been a recently-converted soft-shell crab fan - I've had one too many bad soft-shell crabs back in the day that didn't deserve my precious allergic reaction time. Theirs is lightly breaded, crispy and yummy.  They have a good selection of desserts which are all great. For AYCE, it's only less than $25/person for dinner. That's really cheap for quality sushi.",

    "text": "I show up with an entorage of 7 adults and my 2 toddlers to this spot usually.  Unfortunately, we have been turned down 3 times in person and even after calling in to reserve a spot.  We always tip 20%.  We always eat what has been ordered.  Not once have we been disruptive.     The last time I brought my handicapped senior citizen mother and they told her that she couldn't even have a seat to wait to tell the rest of our party.  She begged the older hostess lady as my mum can't stand the pain for too long and the waitress very rudely shoved her off with her forearm and said \"No!  No you cannot sit no where.  No!\".    Aside from that my brother had serious 7 disk spinal surgery done and needs to use a mobility scooter to get around.  I believe this is the absolute reason why they keep turning us down.  I'm not sure what the customs are wherever Sakana's owners are from, but as far as I can remember when someone is handicapped in 'Merica we usually abide with the   AMERICANS with DISABILITIES ACT: ADA Title III under PUBLIC ACCOMODATIONS.    Certain liberties must be taken when a disabled person requests for assistance in most any public or privately owned or leased facility.  Shame on you Sakana.    Besides that the food has really become mediocre within the last few months.  For your first time you might get a kick out of it.  Surely after eating at much nicer and better sushi restaurants like Kaizen or NOBU, this isn't by far the best sushi to be had on the east side.",

We planned on trying Sakana and I sure am glad we did! We got there right at 11 as they opened for lunch, the adults decided on the AYCE which was $20.95 and the kids got individual plates.  All I had to do was read Antonia R's and my trusted yelpers reviews to steer me in the right direction on what to order. We started with seaweed salad, edamame, gyoza and shrimp tempura. Then moved on to their nigiri's: Salmon, Garlic tuna, Yuzu yellowtail and my favorite salmon belly! OMG I'm salivating right now just talking about it. It was so buttery, melt in your mouth goodness! As many have mentioned, the fish to rice ratio is incredible! Of the rolls we tried, I liked the lobster roll and Hawaiian roll the best. I had their salmon skin roll extra crispy and that too was amazing! The bulgogi nachos I wasn't a fan of, it was way too sweet and the flavors didn't meld well. My son got a curry plate with chicken katsu. My daughter doesn't eat curry so we got her just the rice and pork tonkatsu but they still charged us as if we got the curry plate (just a TIP: they don't offer katsu plates, so if you want that, you have to order the curry plate minus the curry and pick either chicken katsu or pork katsu as a topping for an extra $2 and $3 respectively)   The service was great up until about an hour after they opened when it started getting really busy, it took over 30 minutes for us to get our baked mussels, I didn't care so much as I was bursting in the seams at that point. For dessert I got the green tea panna cotta which was just ok and the honey toast with honey cream inside topped with ice cream, which was awesome. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes. Thanks again Antonia R for this rockin' recommendation!",

    "text": "I've been to Sakana quite a few times before and I've always enjoyed the food and have even recommended it to numerous people but the last few times I've been here service has unfortunately gotten so much worse.   I came here a couple weeks ago and received sub par service but because I had really great experiences in the past I decided it was only fair to give them another chance as I may have just come on a bad day. Today I brought my entire family and talked so highly about Sakana prior to arrival, only to be disappointed.   Took us about 15 minutes to get our waters and we were the first guests there. I asked if they could do no rice rolls and our server told us multiple times that they could then another server came up to us and proceeded to say that it was not possible and they would charge us ON TOP OF THE AYCE PRICE!  Determined to not let it ruin my experience I passed it off as a misunderstanding and waited and waited and waited for our rolls. It is currently 12:54 and I've been here since 11:30 and I'm still waiting for rolls I ordered over an hour ago.   I ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream a la carte and they came out with the most pathetic excuse of a scoop of ice cream. Their \"scoop\" bad basically 2 spoon scoop, something a grown adult can basically finish in 2-3 bites. When I brought it up without server she gave us attitude me proceeded to respond \"well that's our scoop\". For the price that I'm paying ($2.50) I'd at least expect a decent scoop of ice cream.   I've always loved Sakana and was originally going to give this 3 stars because maybe I came at a wrong time, but my experience only got worse the longer I stayed. Extremely disappointed and I regret ever recommending this place to so many people. I would hate for them to have the same disappointing experience. Will definitely not be returning.",

But after coming back again 2 more other times with my best friend I began to love this place.   At first I was put off because there was so much to choose from. Not good for a person like me because I'm so indecisive. Coming with a person who knows what's good helps. They have really good Uni which is a must for me.  I also love their BOGO alcohol special. My favorite roll I always tend order here is the chanel roll. I also love the tomato balls. It's salmon rolled up as a ball and topped wonderfully. So again they have great stuff here and get 5 stars from me for being really creative. I do remember their menu also being organized and separated by baked rolls, fried rolls, spicy rolls. That was another pro for me.  They are a clean well kept restaurant but can we please talk about how adorable their woman's hello kitty bathroom is !!!!   ***One more last thing if you show them your review you get a free beverage. Soda sake or beer. Which is nice of them but I have to wonder how authentic are people's actual reviews of the place. Anyways if you're gonna check this place out don't forget about this cool perk***  You can count on me to come back again!",

    "text": "Suzie Q's Fun Facts:  The modern \"all-you-can-eat\" concept has been ascribed to Herb McDonald, a Las Vegas entertainment manager who debuted the idea at a casino in 1956 to motivate gamblers to keep going into the wee hours.  =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~  My friends and I were driving through Vegas on our way back to LA from Zion National Park in Utah, and used Yelp to find a cheap, tasty-sounding lunch spot. The affordable, well-reviewed Sakana easily won out.   If you show up at Sakana between the hours of 12-3 pm, you can order AYCE sushi at the \"lunch\" price, which is $20.95 (versus the $24.95 dinner price). We showed up just under the wire at around 2:45, so snagged the cheaper pricing.   We absolutely gorged on AYCE sushi. I ordered a ton of nigiri (salmon belly, yuzu yellowtail and sea trout were highlights), and a single, massive lobster roll that I could barely finish. Friends ordered mostly rolls and a few nigiri. I capped off my meal with a small bowl of mango mochi ice cream, and one companion enjoyed her mini honey toast topped with ice cream.   Considering the sushi was AYCE, our expectations were suitably low, and mostly, the sushi tasted fresh enough and satisfying. The variety on the menu was sure impressive.   My only complaints: Most nigiri came drenched in some type of vinegar or citrus juice, resulting in soggy rice that usually fell apart as my chopsticks grabbed it. (Were these dressings used to mask the flavor of less-than-fresh fish? I hope not). And the rolls were mostly smothered in mayonnaise-y sauces and tempura-fried, rather than arriving simple, light and unadorned. (Not my taste, but others might love them).   In retrospect, I did wonder whether AYCE is the best option at Sakana, considering how affordable the a la carte menu is. Rolls that would be $15.95 in LA cost only $7.95 (or less) here. Nigiri is, on average, only $2.95.  If you are super ravenous, you'd probably spend more than $20.95 a la carte.... but if you're only moderately hungry, stick with a (huge) roll and a couple nigiri off the a la carte menu, and you'll save a few bucks from the AYCE price.    Still, this is a great deal if you're hungry enough for AYCE, especially if you come during lunchtime. Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "Here's how my experience started...  I called Sakana to see how long the wait was and they said 30 minutes.  It was Saturday at 830 and all the other places had the same wait, so It was no big deal. We pulled up and put our name on the list. I was really hoping for seats at the sushi bar, but there were only 4 and they were all taken. Not a big deal - though it seemed like they could easily fit another 2 chairs up there.  We waited in line while other tables got called up - then magically, just as we were next on the list, two seats at the sushi bar opened up!  The lady came over (I assumed to take us to the seats at the bar) and much to my surprise, she grabbed the two people who were AFTER us in line and showed them to the sushi bar.    Um...what? Look, if this guy is a regular (and it seemed like he was), that's cool man - but at least make a comment to us that our table would be ready in a minute.  Or, I don't know - don't make it so obvious that you're just letting other people cut in line.   Considering that I'm sure I've been the recipient of a restaurateur's kindness more than a few times, I knew I couldn't be too annoyed...(though clearly, I was, as I'm writing this review from the restaurant).  Okay - so we only had to wait another 3-4 minutes - but still, it's the principle.  The rest of the service was just okay.  Here's what I liked - their rolls are very inventive. The spicy rolls are actually spicy! The drinks are all 2 for 1. The food was good. The rolls weren't so doused in sauce that I couldn't taste the fish. Oh - and the honey toast is awesome.  I'm saying its a 3.5 but because I like good karma, I'll round up to a 4.",

We left the hotel, about 2 miles away and got to the restaurant. They asked us to sign in and I noticed that there were two 5 party tables ahead of us. We stood there for a few minutes and I realized that there were 4 two seat tables open sporadically thru the restaurant I went to talk to the main guy. He basically said that there were only two servers so they weren't going to seat us, even though they had 5 sushi chefs working behind the bar. Two servers for the whole restaurant? Did I forget to mention this is a Sunday night, at prime dinner time?? I wouldn't go here again even if they actually paid me to. Not even worth it with the way their service was. Could you imagine how long you'd be waiting? I'm sure they do that on purpose though, since it's ayce and they want you to get full, they understaff and then you barely get your fill lol. Never, ever, waste your time here.",

On the negative side, the rolls we ordered were too far on the sweet side. The nigiri was good; a good ratio of fish to rice but the rice was a bit dry and crumbly.  The service was good. I would return and I think it would be pretty easy on successive visits to hone my menu selections a bit better. I was not expecting the sweetness.",

Service sucks! a lot of missing food which i patiently waited for. I forgot to mention their sushi rice don't hold up too well. It kept falling apart on me.

I've honestly had some really bad experiences with some restaurants and their rice because sometimes it's too sour, sweet, or wet, but Sakana hits it right on the spot. Their appetizers are delicious. I'm in love with all of them. Also, a must try at this place is their towering poke.",

My favorites were the Summer Crunch which was sweet and had crab and lobster and the Black Sesame Manger which is sort of like a pudding/creme brulee without the brulee.  My husband and I did go at about 5 o'clock, and it was kind of quiet, but the food was great.  The tempura was crunchy without being greasy and the sashimi salad was fresh and flavorful.

    "text": "This is more of a 3.5 star experience.  We met fellow Yelper Eric for lunch.  It was a little difficult to find as they didn't have the Sakana sign out front.  So, we drove around thinking we were in the wrong place and had to make a call to ask for directions.  Anyhow, we drove back and walked in.  We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress.  We were given a lot of attention as we were the only customers in there.  Now, I am still a Sushi newbie.  I have only been to one other place, and I am sure I will compare all other experiences with that place.  The price of the rolls were cheap and I decided to just have 2 rolls.  I couldn't tell you what rolls I had nor what Michele and Eric had.  But, the price was right.  2 rolls for about $10.  Filling and good.  So, I am still going to be widening my sushi walls and hope to find other places.",

The food was worth the wait and the all you can eat for $25 is the best deal you can get on amazing sushi.  Highly recommend if you don't mind the awkward wait.",

I know it's considered rude to come in right before close but I was parked outside with a solid thirty minutes and assured a woman on the phone I only wanted two rolls and would be out the door. As I walked to the door to enter the woman had already alerted someone to close up and the man looked at me like a CHILD being scolded or disciplined as he switched the sign from open to closed THIRTY MINUTES EARLY. This is vegas I thought we all understood what good hospitality is but unfortunately not Sakana. My advice would be to change your closing hour back to 11pm if you don't want/appreciate the business.",

I really do recommend going to sakana even if you think you don't like sushi this place will definitely change your mind.

The price was great for rolls and sashimi but selection was average.  I wanted the sashimi salad but don't eat salmon and the waitress said couldn't have it then as it's premade?!?!?! Premade sashimi salad???? So I got the screaming O and I've had better... Ok you can insert your own dirty joke but the tuna sashimi had a Cajun rub on it which wasn't great. The dish seemed skimpy for double order and the sauce was a little runny. I'm not into fried sushi and no real unique spicy tuna rolls it seemed..... Everyone else had good things to say so maybe it's just what I ordered.  So I'll maybe try it one more time but I won't rush and I don't think with all the other places it would be a fave. It didn't help either we had to call to find it as the sign still says kabuki.... But the great company made time fly by!",

So it was kind of a hassle getting everyone's order down on one piece of paper. They said it would've confused the chefs if we used more than one. #2 the Uni was horrendous. Other than those two things... The sushi came out pretty quick and we were overall satisfied. Would recommend and try again",

I recently dined here twice on different occasions with other friends and needlessly to say that the service was a bit lacking this time around. The first time I went was with two friends and the guy that took our orders seemed rushed or in a hurry and didn't seem he was listening or being attentive. We understand that the place is busy, but as we were about to order, he walks away from us and doesn't bother to come back and take the rest of our orders. As my friends and I sit there we all looked at each other and said to ourselves...Um okay! As we said this out loud, the gentleman that was standing next to me looked liked he was the manager and I guess he overheard our conversation and asked what was wrong. We told him what was going on, he then proceeded to take our order since that guy waiter failed to take the first time. No apology from the guy waiter from walking away from us and didn't bother to acknowledge us after this incident. He looked overwhelmed with maybe the amount of tables he had to serve but to leave us hanging and not finish what we wanted to order was just rude. On my second trip with a friend, he was our waiter again. This time he was a little bit better till the last round. My friend had asked for one more order and what happens we never got my friends last order. Why write something down on your paper to place an order but don't bother to even send out the request. He didn't even bother to check if we got it or not. After he forgot to place the last order, he then went straight ahead to ask us if we were ready for dessert?!?  Um...What happened to our last order??!  After this mishap twice in a row with the same guy waiter, I will request another server that won't forget anything we ordered and hopefully the new server will be more attentive and not felt like he or she is being rushed.",

We went in on Valentine's Day and had a wait time of about 40 minutes due to it being a holiday. Towards the end of our meal, we were sitting there waiting for our last roll to come out when the owner approaches our table and practically kicks us out and says there's people waiting. She was extremely rude and totally unacceptable especially her being the owner like come on! None the less, we decided to give it another try. Today we went in and asked the guy if we could please get a booth seating because I personally find those more comforting on my back. He proceder to say that side of the room is closed (despite there being people seated there) and refused to let us sit there. We said ok thank you and walked out. Avoid this place at all cost!! Food quality goes hand in hand with service and I'm sorry but this place lacks major service and attitude changes. Go somewhere else if you want to be treated nicely!!",

We had a large party of 10 + 2 kids and they gave us the room to the front that was walled off to the side. That accommodated us perfectly! It was Friday night too at 7pm and we were seated pretty much right away!  The waitress- Raynee?- was very sweet and attentive to us. She even offered to split the check into two separate ones to make it easier for us. They also didn't make a big deal about several people in the party not getting the AYCE but only getting a teriyaki plate.  There were so many rolls to choose from. Yeah, the sushi was not the freshest I've tasted in my life, but was pretty good quality and I like the small cuts so it's not too filling. The skewers were really small and I think it was limited to one piece per. There were also a few other items on the menu which are limited to one per person. Next time I'm visiting Vegas, I'd return with several people again so we can try a more variety of rolls!",

    "text": "I am never going to debate with friends/family on where we go for sushi.. Sakana surpasses every AYCE sushi place in Vegas in taste, fish:rice ratio, freshness, food options, alcohol prices, service and atmosphere. I lived in Japan for 16 years- I know my sushi. (Obviously it's not Japanese style sushi, but if you don't compare it to that- it's really, really good) 1. Drive up to the Target complex on Maryland- the restaurant is on the Eastern side of Target, almost behind it.  2. Appreciate the atmosphere. One wall looks straight off of a rustic country living DIY Pinterest board, another a Studio Ghibli and animation shrine, another a fancy teppanyaki restaurant and finally a bathroom all about Hello Kitty and everything kawaii.  3. Start with the Baked Green Mussel appetizer. These mussels were FAT. The red sauce has a slight kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy. I could eat an entire meal of these.  4. Fill up with nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is perfect here. The rice itself isn't necessarily smaller, but instead the slices of fish are bigger. Fresh, fresh, fresh. There's no fishy smell or the overly dyed fish you might get at other restaurant. They offered a few lake fish (non-Ocean) as nigiri, which I had not previously tried before. Interesting, but good. You won't find that in Japan!  5. Start your AMRAP or As Many Rolls As Possible. The rolls are smaller and each roll is crafted artistically and not just thrown together. The No Name, Wet Dream, Bam Bam roll were my favorite, but there were not any rolls that I didn't like.  6. HONEY TOAST FOR DESSERT. Need I say anymore? Sakana is the first AYCE sushi restaurant that I have seen offer this. Don't bother with the tiramisu, mochi icecream (both were good) Honey Toast always wins.  Eat, sleep, repeat. Eat, sleep, repeat.",

Our dinner here tonight has met all of my requirements for my last meal on earth (...no, I'm not dying...) Sakana is ranked in my number one AYCE sushi joints of all time. All time! I can't even begin to tell you how incredible each and every item we ordered was.  The fish to rice ratio is insane! All of our nigiri had the tiniest bit of rice, yet lengthy, juicy, plump, fresh, sweet, and expertly sliced pieces of fish. Mouthwatering quality!   These are what dreams are made of: - Salmon nigiri (My salmon addict tongue is happy)  - Salmon belly nigiri (Heaven on earth buttery sweetness) - Yellowtail belly nigiri (You had me at belly!)  - Uni nigiri (Eyes rolling to the back of your head in pure enjoyment, yup sounds exactly right)  - Ama ebi (It was ginormous!)  - Albacore with garlic ponzu nigiri (My inner sauce whore was loving the garlic ponzu, also the albacore was bu-tter-yyyyyyy!) - Yuzu yellowtail nigiri (Give us 4 orders stat! Love this refreshing nigiri)  - Baked green mussels (They've mastered the baked green mussel here. Delicious!!!) - Tower of sashimi poke (love the crisp wonton chip and the explosive flavors!) - Japanese nachos (kind of like the tower of sashimi poke and it's really addicting!) - Karai Sashimi (like a dry seasoned poke. I loved how much salmon and tuna they gave! Generous portion!) - Seafood salad (very refreshing and flavorful) - Miso soup - Perfect every time. (Not out of a powder package- ya dig?) - D's guy roll (refreshing, flavorful, great texture)  - Lemon salmon sushi roll (Refreshing! Eat with ponzu)  - Oh! and their ponzu sauce is spectacular. Pairs great with all of their nigiri.  --and so much more! I don't have enough room in my tummy to try everything all at once, so I'm always making a list of a what to get next time I come.   Service was even better than last time we were here (I didn't think that was possible). They quickly went out of their way to give us everything we wanted and then some. Our server is always this cute petite asian woman and she is so sweet and always makes sure everything we need we get right away! Even the sushi chef Dragon visits our table to politely let us know our baked items will be out soon (we weren't even waiting long for them) - what a stand-up guy! He is super friendly and hysterical! We always get a kick out of his silly personality. Definitely makes the restaurant experience lively, entertaining and very personal.   I'll be the first to admit, I'm obsessed with this place. Major foodgasm for sure! I refuse to go anywhere else for AYCE sushi now. They consistently exceed in offering quality cuts of fish and the explosive flavors that we expect, which keeps us coming back for more! Thank you Sakana for not breaking my belly!",

TIPS:  - Plenty of parking so no worries! - The restaurant is located at the corner of the plaza's building with a sign that doesn't look appealing. I know it sounds shady but the interior is nicely decorated and like I mentioned previously the workers are totally awesome.  - DESSERT IS INCLUDED IN THE AYCE!!!! Mochi and ice cream.

Only concern regarding food is the size of their appetizer and dessert. $3.75 for 3 tiny pieces of agedashi tofu is in my mind pretty steep. Same for the green tea panna cotta which was delicious but really tiny - about the size of a soy sauce dish.   The service is what lets it down. We didn't feel attended to at all, even though they had quite a few empty tables. I get that they probably have more to do for AYCE tables, but after much waiting and trying to flag someone down, we literally had to stretch out our arm to stop someone and have our orders taken. Our food was also taken to the wrong table, and to top it off, we were charged for something we didn't order. Maybe we came in at an off-time, but this was the lowest point of our stay in Vegas.",

Those are the three important things that we look for in an establishment, and Sakana always meets those expectations. Don't let the so-so area of town or the strip mall location throw you, this is the best sushi spot. We have tried many sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, as friends and social groups have decided on these other locations, and we always come back to Sakana. We leave those restaurants disappointed. Whether it be the smaller cuts of fish, or the slower service, or things on the menu that are not what we are looking for. Sakana is our favorite, and if we eat at another sushi spot, it is not because we chose to, that is for sure. Sakana doesn't need this review, and we have been hesitant to write one as we love our local sushi restaurant and don't want it to become overly busy where we can't continue to dine there. But we had to add one more positive review to their page. The team at Sakana deserve it, they work very hard and we love this restaurant so much!",

It's basically just a small box you sit on and they put a little pillow on it. There wasn't even a back rest on it. I had to go put my purse in the car because I had no room to put it anywhere.   Second, wow the wait time for your food drags. It took forever for rolls to come out, even longer for nigiri. Mind you, it wasn't even that busy. At the very end we decided to order dessert because we were just waiting and waiting for our nigiri. Which took like 5 seconds to devour.   Other than those 2 complaints.. The freshness of the food still over powered my complaints. The rice to fish ratio was amazing. The best I've seen.. Still 1 of my favorite sushi joints in town and will still probably return but hopefully they fix the seats before I come back...",

Basically, unless you're truly a lazy jackass, you can definitely escape the price gouging that happens on the Strip.  Case in point, Sakana. I'm not really much of an AYCE guys these days. But we were absolutely starving and the AYCE is worth it if you order three rolls. Fish was pretty fresh for Vegas standards and you could definitely taste the quality in the rolls. On top of that, I loved how almost everything (including nigiri!) was on the table for AYCE. And those cuts of fish are huge for nigiri! They definitely don't jip you on it.  Of course, with any AYCE place...you'd be best to just order everything upfront in the first round of orders. Service does typically get slow after that. Overall though, service was solid enough and I have no complaints.  Definitely glad I found this little gem and will come back for sure!",

The place has a japanese characteristic setting and anime seating cushions. Lol pretty nice. I like that you get more fish in a nigiri here. Some downers are that they charge separately from appetizers at lunch time ending before 3pm when they're suppose to be AYCE. So if u want the full menu, eat after 3pm for the dinner special. And some dishes are only one time orders or can only be served at dinner time.... Not satisfying that u are limited. I can admit the service is fast and friendly. Still a good place to experience.  My favorite is the - tomato roll",

    "text": "I decided to come here because it had such a high rating and the pictures on Yelp looked very promising.  But after my visit to this Sushi Restaurant, I feel deceived and annoyed.  I dont want to write an essay but I want to make it short and clear.  1. The servers forgot my orders more than 3 times. We had to reorder and remind them which sushi we did not receive.  2. I asked for lots of ginger since I eat A LOT, and the guy didnt know how to speak English and he gave me a tiny bit which was already prepared with the wasabi on the sauce plate.  3. Servers dont know how to work. They are very distracted and disorganized. They keep coming to our table saying, 'did you guys order _______?' I mean why are you keep coming to my table asking me if I ordered this and that. You should know. The thing is, I didnt order anything they asked me. They went to the table behind me asking the same thing. So unprofessional.  Sushi? It was OK. Not as good as what everyone said in the reviews. Not worth $25-$26 with crappy service. They were only quick when I asked for a check and taking my check to the register. Horrible.  Please train your servers before letting them ruin your restaurant's reputation. I beg of you.",

Some of the items are limited to one item per order (salmon belly, poke, Uni, oysters...) but it's steak a great deal for all the food you get. The nigiri is really good quality, fresh and very little rice. Our favorites were the tuna, salmon belly, unagi and yellowtail. Pretty much everything we tried was really good though. The scallops roll had large pieces of scallops instead of the regularly seen bay scallops. Service was excellent, they were quick to pick up dirty dishes. Finished the meal with green tea panna cotta which was really good, strong matcha flavor, smooth texture and not sugary. We also had the coffee mochi but it seemed old because the outside was hard and crumbly - couldn't eat it. But overall still giving five stars for the food quality and value.",

Easily one of the best sushi places on town with a good atmosphere and good service.  Best things to eat/ recommendations: 1. Sashimi salad.  This thing was amazing.  A nice pile of salmon, yellowtail, and albacore with sweet cucumber and shrimp.   2.  Be happy roll: surprise crunch inside a savory tuna, salmon, avocado roll.  3.  The shit.

    "text": "Used YELP to find this one.  Thank you to all the previous reviewers.  This place was a little hard for me to find, but then again....I'm not a local.  I'd classify it as a \"hole in the wall\", but all across America, they are oft times the best places to visit.  They open at 1130 during the week.  They were a little slow to open and the front of the store was full of hungry patrons.  But....it was well worth the wait.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different chefs plying their trade.  My chef was Jose. He was very pleasant and skilled at his craft.  I ordered 4 of the Tuna Nigiri.  It was thick cut and had  a small dollop of rice under it.  I know a lot of people complain that Sushi Restaurants use too much rice.  I personally would have preferred a bit more.  The tuna was OK.  But not as flavorful as other sushi restaurants I've been to.  I didn't really like the thick cut with the small amount of rice.  I guess some people would call that \"splitting hairs....?\"  One thing I liked since I had chosen the AYCE lunch was the rolls were four pieces.  That gave me an opportunity to try more varieties.   The Orange Blossom Roll was a tempura shrimp roll.  It had a wonderful sweet flavor. It was tight and perfectly sized for one bite enjoyment. All their rolls were like that.  These two you've got to try...!  The Playboy has seared salmon on top with cream cheese and eel sauce.  Un-Freakin  believable!  The Baked Lobster Roll was everything as delicious as the Playboy.  EVERY BIT!  And the name of the roll speaks for itself.  Need I say more....?  Sodas are served out of the can with a cup of ice.  Fine by me.",

    "text": "With over 1200 Yelp reviews with 4.5 average rating, it's worth checking this place out and to compare with my favorite AYCE sushi joints: Yama Sushi and Sushi Kaya.  Unfortunately, this place falls way short.  On the plus side, service is quick and friendly and if you like Korean Pop music, you will get your fill for sure.  As mentioned in multiple reviews the rice to raw fish ratio is 3 to 1 fish to rice.  This also applies to the salmon roe and flying fish eggs sushi, very generous portions of eggs.  The honey toast dessert is unique from other AYCEs and pretty good.   There were multiple times where they forgot my order and had to ask again to follow up.  I didn't think it would be so hard to get miso soup.  The same goes asking for a refill of iced and hot green tea.  At least they got it right after asking 2 times, they finally got the message.  Although the fish to rice ratio was generous, the fish itself was below average quality for AYCE (look at the pics, see the grizzle).  Their salmon \"kama\" is not kama (fish collar).  I have never encountered kama in such whole pieces, a lot of unsuspecting and inexperienced diners won't may not know the difference.  This was disappointing, especially since they didn't have any hamachi kama available.  Another theme, greasy, greasy, and more greasy.  You can smell it when you walk in and applied to anything fried.  Expect excessive saucing on their rolls.  My \"punishment\" to keep my wife happy is going to Sushi Kaya the next day and things were much better.  Going to sushi AYCEs two days in row isn't all that bad when visiting Vegas.",

Their sashimi rests on a small ball of rice and the sushi there is very fresh. The lunch price of 20.95 for all you can eat is very reasonable with lots of options to choose from. Anything you order here is good. The nachos were a little greasy and fatty but overall still satisfying. The service is fast and price for quality sushi unbeatable. A must try.   Oh and for dessert, do try The afogato and the honey toast. The honey toast is the best with ice cream on top!!",

I'd drive through here for dinner or make the trip though I live a ways away haha. I brought some coworkers here and it's become a favorite lunch spot as we work near by on the strip for 20.95.  Sakana has almost ruined me for other sushi spots, with the exception of Neko, which I suspect is under the same ownership/ management, overall very similar rolls. Their sauce combinations and spiciness have left me a bit unsatisfied, as if their ingredients are missing, from other places. They have a wide variety of fish options and offer an extended menu of rice less options during dinner $25.95  This little local Vegas gem brings some serious AYCE competition, one of the best. They usually have a wait but I've never waited too long whether I sit with coworkers at lunch or I sit at the bar, chefs are quick too. The roll and appetizer variety is plentiful, they offer exclusive dinner menu specials which is totally worth the dinner price. They offer a good selection of rice less rolls and options. They aren't thinly sliced on the fish, which I love about their nigiri, and their sauces are always just the right amount to complement the flavor.",

I do agree that the bang to buck ratio especially for all you can eat sushi is incredible here. Shawn isnt kidding at all when he mentions the fish to rice ratio, they don't crop the slice to the rice, instead they leave a giant slice that's long enough to wrap around the rice which is quite a noticeable change as compared to other spots.   Another thing that impressed me what the Goyemon-like policy on no limitations to how many desserts you can get.  The plum ice cream was by far some of the best ice cream I've had in a sushi joint.  So why a missing star? Well of the things we ordered were sauce heavy, they really sauced up some of the dishes. A few of the appetizers lacked an explanation on the menu but instead said something long the lines of 'hey you! order me i am friggin amazing!' and when it comes it's nothing more than krab (that fake crab that's made from fish paste) in a deep fried shell drizzled with sauce. Not to say it wasnt good, well to me it wasnt that's just due to my hatred of krab with a K, but had i known i would have not ordered it and went for more nigiri.   definitely on my radar now as an all you can eat sushi joint that has great value for what you get but i'll be steering clear of the sauced items.

While we were in the middle of eating, our waitress walked by our table and screamed at us \"YOU GUYS ARE CHEATING!!! You guys did not finish the rice on the plates when we picked it up! I'm letting you know we are charging you for leftover rice. I automatically added it to your bill already.\" Our entire table just had a complete moment of silence because of her tone of voice. I told her excuse me, trying to hint to her if she just realized what tone of voice she talked to us in. However, she still screamed at us for a second time repeating the same thing again. I just told her do you know it's my birthday. She still had an angry look on her face. As she picked up the plates she angrily and insincerely said, \"well happy birthday.\" Like seriously, I can't believe she just said that. It ruined my night. I guess the manager noticed her rude behavior so he decided to take over and serve our table. He was extra nice to us afterwards and he ended up not charging us for leftovers. I give him props for handling our table appropriately. He did a great job. As for the waitress, I don't know how he handled her. Oh did I mention they didn't give us the correct order for our table. They gave us like 5 extra dishes that are probably another tables order. I use to be a regular here, but I don't think I will come back again and it's not because of the food, but because of the service.",

Maybe this place is amazing on a Thursday or Friday night, but don't bother coming here on Sunday because you'll just be eating the weekend leftovers. Most of the nigiri that we ordered was mushy and drenched in all kinds of sauces. If I'm ordering nigiri, I want to eat it the traditional way and dip it in soy sauce myself. All the rolls are creative and fun, but again everything is covered in crazy sweet sauces and it feels like overkill.   Lastly, the waiters never brought some of what we ordered and then brought us stuff we didn't order. If you can't get it right, you should give us one of those lists so we can check it off ourselves.",

My friend and I , totally starving, with our eternal craving for sushi. We saw the reviews on yelp, and figured 'Hey, why not?' The place is located all the way in the back corner of a shopping plaza. It's signs all say Kabuki, and not gonna lie, it seems a tad bit ghetto from the outside. We judged the book by it's cover, and were actually gonna go somewhere else.  Soooooo glad we didn't. We ordered at least 200 bucks worth of sushi, but only spent 46 dollars! They have a rule where you can't bring leftovers home or they have to charge you for each plate you bring home, which makes sense they don't wanna get robbed, especially considering the steal they already offer. We ended up having 6 whole plates of food left at the end of the night. They let us take the whole meal home, AND only charged us for one of the plates.  The waitresses were all too cute, and sweet. Very attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back! Would recommend to anybody with a wish for a sushi fulfillment!  Ps when we were there they played a Maroon 5 CD on repeat, so if you hate that band, better watch out ;)",

I will never stop coming here as of right now I'm 100% set on sticking with Sakana!",

The rice to nigiri sushi ratio is the best of all AYCE places but then they compensated it by having thinner slices of fish. Overall, a good place to come for sushi.

Walking to Sakana it was a lot of parking and the wait only was 10mins if not less. The great thing is that it's AYCE at a reasonable price. Being pregnant I found a lot of places that had limited fried or baked menu since I can't raw but Sakana offered such a variety of sushi you can get we barely got through half the fried list. Everything was delicious and freshly cooked like it literally was so fresh I had to wait for it cool off! They also had a wide variety of appetizers and desserts that you can't get at other sushi places. This is going to be one of the last times I get to eat sushi in a while and I am so glad I came. It's safe to say they are my favorite sushi place in Vegas!",

    "text": "I used to frequent Sumo Sushi 2 on the west side before management changed and quality took a nosedive. Needless to say I was on the hunt for a new sushi place! A friend of mine (who's a frequent yelper) suggested we try this place. Right off the bat I noticed how clean the restaurant was and the decor was cute. I hadn't seen my friend in a long time so we were catching up for about a good 20 minutes before we actually got to order. The server came over a couple times and we weren't ready (*cringe* we were those people!) but our server was okay with us taking our time. Thumbs up for that. Now the food! We got the seafood salad, the Chanel roll, the popcorn lobster roll, Lisa Lisa, and the Hawaiian roll. We finished off with mango mochi, coffee mochi, and green tea ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious and the fish was really fresh. I love the fact that even though we got AYCE there was still an abundance of protein. In my experience most AYCE places pile on the rice and skimp on the fish.  In the middle of dinner, the music went up and the lights went off! I love the fact that everyone was excited about this customers birthday and I noticed that the group celebrating the birthday had brought a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes. So if I or someone I know decides to have a birthday dinner here it's nice to know we can bring our own cake in. Most places won't allow you to do that.  Overall I was satisfied and I will definitely return!",

Our server was excellent as well! He was always there asking if we needed anything! Here's some stuff we got;  Appetizers; Dynamite: BOMB.  Oysters: delicious!  Pork belly: soooooo goooood, my favorite  Towering sashimi poke: yum! Baked mussels: I'm so glad they didn't smother these in sauce like they do at some other places. The shit: the dipping sauce was soooo orgasmic  Nigiri;  Salmon, Garcia tuna, yuzu yellowtail, garlic ponzu albacore, spicy 300 albacore, Cajun tuna, sweet shrimp, scallops, and eel.  - So if you only get nigiri like I do, this is the place to go. The fish to rice ratio is crazy! There's like a small amount of rice and a big ass piece of fish. On top of that, everything was super fresh.   I'll be coming back here soon!",

This is the first sushi place where they give you a paper and you fill out what you want to eat for your first and second round. It was kind of confusing but you get used to it. Regardless we go our food and it was delicious. The place has really cute and kind of small but it's super cozy and nice.  I def will come back!",

Also very disgusted with the way the shrimp was cleaned.  Definitely would not come back we left disgusted. Would give it no stars if possible.",

    "text": "I've been living in Vegas for 1 year.  I ALWAYS go to the all you can eat sushi across the street from this particular restaurant, \"Sakana on Maryland\" however, i been yelping and reading the great reviews of the restaurant so i decided to go give it a try. I walked in and was greeted by Geo, which he walked us to the table and sat us down. My partner asked him about the 2 for 1 drink special that we seen on yelp, he said yes, I then asked him what type of drinks are part of the 2 for 1. He said sarcastically \"ALCOHOL\" then walked away.   At first, I thought it was a joke, then i quickly realized this Geo server was actually a rude individual. He walks back to our table and my partner says we will talk water \"which was never brought to us\".  I then asked him if we can get another server and he said sarcastically in a non caring manner \"YEA\" and walks away.  No one never came to us for about 3-4 minutes. I then walk up to the young lady to ask to speak to the manager which she tells me he wasn't present and he would be in the following day. I asked for a card and Geo said \" they are right over there\" In a \" non caring who cares\" type of way.  I grab the card took a quick picture of Geo and walked out.   I'm very upset because I really really wanted to try this place after reading all the great reviews but I can't support or spend any of my hard working dollars to a restaurant that has servers that are rude and disrespectful to guests.  I will NEVER go back into this restaurant and I will make sure to tell all my military friends and family to not ever step foot inside.  Geo needs more training on how to treat and speak to guests who are spending money in the establishment that he represents.  The card clearly says \"we work hard for your smile\" however, it is impossible if they continue to have someone such as Geo representing that establishment",

The rolls weren't bad, but the fact that we had to wait for close to an hour to get our food, was a real deal breaker for us. Not only was the waiter uninterested in serving us, but we went through two servers and it wasn't busy at all. After having such substandard service, none of the dishes stood out as all we wanted to do was eat and get out of there.   This restaurant is located in a sketchy corner of even a sketchier strip mall, so do not visit this place if you are trying to have a nice dining experience.",

Being a couple that orders mostly nigiri, anywhere we go we typically order and compare the yellowtail, salmon, and different variations of tuna. Sakana offers the silkiest super white, yuzu yellowtail, spicy tuna, and salmon. The nigiri melts in your mouth and explodes with the freshest flavors. Whether it's ponzu sauce, cajun flavors, or the natural flavor of the fish, you can find them all at Sakana.   As far as waiting/service, all evening was minimum waiting time.  We got seated as soon as we got there (7:00 on a Friday)  and our order was taken promptly. They are always friendly and very accommodating. Our visit could not have gone any smoother. It's the morning after and we already want to go back!",

Sakana has a fantastic, quality sushi menu and a decor that invites the casual diner to delve into the blend of far East and Americana that populates the walls and shelves. The tables and seats are quirky and fun.  The, hard to hear, almost under the breath used car salesman style pitch on the all you can eat does disrupt the euphoria of the experience,  unfortunately reminding the diners of almost a timeshare experience.   Sometimes it is welcome and sometimes it comes across as a  frustrating and insulting ploy to get a diner to agree to it before they've had a chance to process the suggestion.   Definitely eat here, the food is awesome, but make sure you know and heard what the server says before saying yes.",

The rolls do contain a lot of rice, so be careful ordering too much when you go with the all you can eat option (AYCE). The food keeps coming and the staff is always checking on you to see if you will order more. They have plenty of options and you can order from the entire menu. Watch out for some of the spicy options as they can be very spicy. I typically just get regular rolls and add jalapeno. Some of my favorites are the yuzu yellowtail, the baked mussels, and the rainbow add jalapenos. But you really may as well try everything else on the menu as we havent found one thing we don't like aside from the sweet yum yum sauce. Wait times can be long during peak dinner hours. Can't say enough about the staff though, especially the hostess. After the second time there, she recognized us and welcomed us back. Great customer service. Music can be a little loud so if you don't like loud music, this is not the place for you. Mainly new school pop or reggaeton which we love both so not a big deal for us.",

Lots of variety on the menu including desert! Everything we ate was delicious, I've never seen nigiri with such little rice ratio!! LOVED IT. I'm also a huge sweet tooth and loved that they have a variety of items for dessert that includes honey toast, deep fried icecream and AYCE ICECREAM!!!!

    "text": "For an AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, Sakana is serving some exceedingly delicious and fresh fish. I think they have crafted the right mix of quality, variety, and limitations that allow them to serve above average quality fare at a reasonable price.   We stopped in for lunch on for the $21.99 AYCE menu. We started off with a few orders of nigiri including the salmon, maguro, unagi, and hamachi. Besides the unagi, which I thought was over cooked, and overly fatty, the nigiri were all very good. I thought the salmon and hamachi were both very fresh. What stood out most to me was that they actually prepared the nigiri with a small portion of rice, which was sized appropriately for the cut of fish.  On our second round we explored the kushiyaki menu (chicken, beef, tongue, and lobster are available), and we settled on the lobster and bacon, and the chicken yakitori. The lobster and bacon was served as a tiny piece of lobster wrapped in bacon. It tasted okay, but the bite was much too small, especially the lobster, which was such a small piece that it had been overcooked. The chicken was better, but next time I would stick more with the sushi.  After that order we tried some of the less common fish including the salmon belly and ocean trout, as well as the cajun tuna, and paprika smoked salmon. First off, the ocean trout was amazing and by far my favorite of the meal. It was extremely tender, flavorful with just the right balance of fattiness, and the chile that the put on top added a nice complexity to the nigiri. The cajun tuna was also very good and although I don't typically like sushi that has too much added flavors to it, Sakana did it in a way that didn't detract from the taste of the fish.  Overall we had a solid meal at Sakana. I thought they did an admirable job delivering good quality fish at a very reasonable price. While they limit you to only one serving of some of the rarer and more expensive items like the ocean trout, salmon belly, and the lobster and bacon kushiyaki, it did not detract at all from the enjoyment of my meal.   I am definitely looking forward to my next AYCE meal at Sakana, and maybe next time it will be dinner, so I can order the uni!",

There were a couple people at the bar and people at a couple tables. Not sure if it was because it was Monday or what not.. But we had no worries, that only meant more attention to us.  We were wrong ..  Service was pretty terrible, a waiter and waitress couldn't help maybe 7 people (including us)? Wonder what service is like when it IS busy. We had lots of items missing or that were never brought out to us. Wait times between items or ordering was tops 10-15 mins, so most of our dinner consists of waiting, sitting, and eventually food settling in our stomachs.  Quality of sushi is not the best I had, but still decent. I did like that they don't put so much rice in the rolls. Also like the items to choose from on the appetizer menu for my little one. We mainly liked the \"911 Roll\" (I'm not usually a spicy roll type of person), but this was really tasty! The other rolls or appetizers were \"ok\", after all shrimp tempura is shrimp tempura.  \\_()_/   This visit is definitely not my last and hopefully service will be alot better next time.",

I like Philadelphia rolls myself, and the avocado was perfectly soft with the salmon. The smoked paprika salmon was also very nice with some diced veggies on top. And the trout was great, too bad its just two pieces per patron.  Not so great was the yakitori skewer, pieces too thick and dry. The bacon and lobster skewer was also too overcooked: I personally liked it, but I doubt bigger fans of lobster will. The pa fried chicken was OK, but a bit too chewy even when hot. And the curry don katsu was too small and dry.  Seating was good, but the music selection had very few Japanese songs. The American and Spanish songs were too loud as well.  All in all, great selection, and we stuffed ourselves with good fish.",

We were immediately seated at the sushi bar (there was a short wait for a table).  Funky, roomy interior, fun decor, and $25.95 for AYCE.  Everything on the menu.  They did stress that if you 'overordered' and did not consume things you could be charged extra.  Taking their advice we ordered moderately. Ordered mostly nigiri, and one spider roll which was beautifully presented on a wooden platter.  The tobiko was a delightul rainbow of 3 colors.  Also the shrimp tempura, seaweed salad (best I've had in long time), miso soup (meh), and the menu labeled 'must try' \"The Shit\".  Wasnt impressed by \"The Shit\" so I wouldnt recommend it.  I just like typing that.  We'll see if Yelp lets it thru. There were ALOT of servers but I think they could work on their coordination better, we waited several minutes between orders, and waiting for ordering dessert was close to 8-10 minutes.  Everything was fresh and enjoyable, nicely presented, servers were polite, friendly.  And the price, well about as low as I've seen for good quality.  Probably gonna make this our regular AYCE place when we come to town.",

    "text": "I really liked Sakana when it first opened, I went there for lunch a couple of times but because the 'word wasn't out' it was very slow, I was immediately seated, the service was quick and the sushi was good.  You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.  The quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate.",

We were novices and got too filled up on the great signature rolls that they offered.  Get the NIGIRI first, then fill up on the rest of the other items that take previous stomach space.  ;-)!  Also, dessert was limited to one as well so you need to some allocation analysis to fit all you want to try in this meal.  The only reason why they lost a star is that we were kept waiting nearly 15 minutes in between our meal before our nigiri sushi came out.  They had a large party before us but there were four sushi chefs working so I think they lost our order.  Our waiter came back twice and didn't see our food on the table so he went back and forth to see what was the delay.  It took the hostess to check on our food before we got something on our table.  It was very strange but I guess we had an extra 15 minutes to digest our food so we could fit MORE!!  But people were waiting for a table and we weren't finished with our meal so it wasn't such a good deal for them to keep us there occupying a table without eating since we were waiting for things to come out.  We will definitely good again!!",

For one beer and all-you-eat dinner, I paid about $35. More than most sushi places. Overall, the food was good and the menu was huge. There are so many options; however, by the end of the dinner my stomach was growling and doing gymnastics. After a 25 minutes drive home, I went to the bathroom, not good.  One of my friends said her stomach was hurting too, but didn't go to the bathroom. Another one said her stomach was hurting all night, and was on the toilet all morning. One other friend said she was fine. We think it was this red \"spicy\" sauce that was on some of the rolls like Captain America and Burn Your ass, i think it was. It was more of a honey chili sauce to me. My friend said it was very ketchupy. Take that as you will.  It was overall good, and I think i'd go again, if I have to. Definitely not my first choice because of getting sick, but I'd like to think maybe it was a one-time thing.",

There is only a handful of items that is designated for the dinner menu (like uni) but there are a ton of other items that is included in the price including chicken skewers, shishito peppers, miso soup and dessert! We loved the nigiri yellow tail with jalapenos, mackerel with garlic ponzu, the shit (yes that's the name), and too many to name of the creative rolls. What sets them apart from other all you can eat restaurants is the rolls were packed with fish not fillers (rice). It was a nice even amount of rice and fish. Just a little tip- if you're like me and you want to try a little bit of everything- order half rolls. There is a constant crowd so the rotation of the fish was fresh. Service was good and attentive. Water was refilled and no matter who we asked about items on the menu everyone was helpful. When we're back in the area we will return.",

They prepare everything perfectly and the portions are great for a hungry person like me. My family loved the great service and cleanliness. The servers kept checking in to see how we were doing. Amazing spot for anyone dying to try something new off the sushi menu. We really loved this place (if you haven't guessed it yet )",

I would have appreciated my drink being refilled more often and it would have been nice for our server to come by when we were sitting there waiting to order more. However the food was amazing! Fish to rice ratio was great! First we tried the Shit because I guess you have to and it was so delish! With the small amount of rice in everything we tried so much! We tried the shit, the oyster, spider roll, spicy crab roll, jackpot roll, baked lobster roll, kiss of fire roll, tiger roll, Krispy rice, and jalapeno bomb. Everything was great. I wasn't too fond of the spider roll, carrots are just odd to me in sushi. I don't really like baked rolls but the baked lobster  roll was so good. The Krispy rice was ok but definitely think it just looks better in pictures than it was. We finished with Mango mochi. We left pleasantly satisfied and not overly stuffed with rice. We took the advice to order a little at a time but with how long we seemed to wait in between orders we will order more at a time next time. We plan to be back very soon! Definitely then best AYCE we've been too. And WAYYY better than the boring appeal and sucky service at Yama.",

    "text": "Wow !  What a place !  I'm a traditional sushi eater. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I like the raw fish on a ball of rice. I like some sushi rolls as long as they are made with traditional Japanese ingredients which means, I don't enjoy sushi with any kind of mayonnaise of chili or sweet caramelized sauces. That being said.   The raw fish was extremely fresh, carved perfectly. The rice portions were very small so you got more fish then rice and the nigiri would fit in ONE biteful. Nigiri is not meant to be eaten in 2 bites.  It falls apart. The selection, quality, freshness was outstanding. The waiter would come back to take our orders before we had finished the current one and the sushi would appear VERY quickly. No waiting around. This is one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to, and I've had sushi in  London, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Seoul, Hong Kong, Sydney, etc....So !   FIVE STARS !   JoeBob says check it out !~",

I also noticed that big parties of 6 or more likes to come here so I think that's why sometimes there's a wait. They are fast too and have great customer service.",

The wait was about 20-30 minutes on a late Saturday night dinner and it was definitely worth it.  The quality of their fish was  and I loved how their pieces of sushi was huge with tiny rice. I don't know about you but every time i go to AYCE sushi I eat half their rice and the rest I sunk in miso soup (because most ayce sushi restaurants will charge u if u don't eat the rice). But at Sakana I didn't even have to do that, even once!!!!   Unfortunately a few of the sushi's were only \"one order per person\" which made me sad because I wanted to eat unlimited amount of it! Their tuna and salmon belly melted in my mouth. Their yellowtail was clean and smooth. Their uni was butter in my mouth. A bunch of other dishes were just amazing! I'm hoping to make a trip to Sakana every tine I'm in LV.",

The price was pretty good, about $20.95 or so for lunch, which is pretty standard for this area, but still a great value. The variety was some of the best that I've had at any ayce sushi place (good variety of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, etc), and the quality of fish was really good.  One of the biggest problems at sushi places is that the ratio of rice-to-fish is not right. For the really cheap places, there will be little fish and way too much rice. Other places will have tiny rice peaces that doesn't balance out the fish. This place has the PERFECT ratio in my opinion.  Lastly, dessert was phenomenal. We had the ice cream on toast, the green tea panna cotta, and the affogato, all of which were fantastic.  Service was great, no complaints. There were only 2 waiters and they managed to serve almost a full house. Also, we arrive right at 3:01pm, right when dinner technically started, and they were nice enough to give us lunch prices because we told them we tried to get here on time but traffic was bad.  Would highly recommend going here and trying it out. I will be sure to stop by here every time I go to vegas, that's for sure.",

These restaurants were not good enough to change from our usual sushi spots. But also the food tastes exactly the same and they all serve the same thing! It was just okay to me. Btw, I did like their mini honey toast! That was pretty much the only thing I really enjoyed. Besides the cute atmosphere it's better worth your money/time to wait at Goyemon, Oyshi, or Kaya.",

I love the fish to rice ratio where this place does not overly fill each roll with fish, great stuff. The nigiri yellowtail was on point. My sister and I ordered the Amigo roll, yellow tail hamachi, baked lobster roll, and fried California roll. I'd definitely pass on the baked/fried rolls next time and pick the fresh rolls instead. Baked rolls gets me full much faster. A perfect way to end the night was with a mini honey toast dessert.  Overall, this place is great and has a lot of variety in their sushi.",

A wide selection of items on the menu for AYCE, quite impressive. They also don't give you a lot of rice relative to the fish size. In terms of AYCE quality, this is pretty good. Don't expect excellent quality sushi, but it is pretty darn good in terms of AYCE within Vegas.",

    "text": "After spending 3 hours trying to figure out where to eat we came here. We didn't want to spend so much money on food because of the location or the name. We wanted to try something that was more local versus something that revolved around tourists. We came across this place while we were looking for sushi. Looking at the photos of the food/inside and we really liked what we saw.   The entire experience was great! We had to put our name on the waiting list but was seated quickly. I noticed the entire night that everyone who had to wait was seated quickly. 5 minutes seem to be the max time which is great!   The environment was great! Good music (our personal taste) and great decor!   We ordered a few items: Tonkatsu Ramen (Was a little bland and tasted like it came from a packaged ramen pack)  Chicken Katsu Bacon Wrapped Lobster Chicken Karage I Love My Ass Bam Bam Roll Summer Crunch Chanel Roll  If we hadn't done the A.Y.C.E. deal we would have paid around $60 for our meal. Instead we paid around $56. Not much of a difference but we didn't eat til we were full due to us going out right after.   The food tasted AMAZING! The fact that you could get the appetizers for a cheap price was good! The rolls were great as well. The few that I did try was good! My boyfriend really enjoyed it as well! He inhaled EVERYTHING and didn't want to leave!   Highly recommend this place to those who want something the locals go to!",

For some reason, every AYCE sushi place leaves me tongue feeling strange after having their raw fish... and this place was the same.   We ordered a bunch of different rolls and nigiri. Nothing out of the ordinary, rice to fish ratio was good.   The only memorable item I had was an appetiser. I've left an image of the \"Dragonball\", a battered and fried mushroom filled with cream cheese. The same filling you'd expect from Crab Rangoon. It's served with little crisps and eel sauce.   Ya gotta try it at least once. Where my DBZ peeps at?!",

The portion of rice in their rolls and nigiri was small which means more room for a variety of sushi. They also had a 2 for 1 special on drinks. We tried their yogurt-flavored soju and it was yummy. In the end, you can choose from a good variety of dessert including fried bananas a la mode, mochi ice cream, and fried ice cream.   Service was on point too. The food and drinks were served quickly. They cleaned out the empty plates in a timely manner.   I definitely recommend this place to locals and visitors.",

We felt like we were being rushed, and we felt that the way he asks about our orders as if we don't know what to get, granting we dont't know what to order 'coz we're not Japenese. He could've asked us politely. It definitely affected our whole dining experience.  Been there several times but our previous servers did our orders right without any intimidation, without any questions. We ordered the chef's special same thing we order everytime time we were there, we even showed him a picture of it but he kept on insisting that the quantity wasn't right and that we wouldn't be able to finish it. Instead of just ordering it, he went on and on up to the point that he was being argumentive and that really annoyed us we had to request for another server.  They should improve on their customer service and be mindful of the customer's dinning experience.",

We came on Boxing Day for lunch and it was packed.  Once sat, the service was quick and attentive with no frills, but very nice.  The food was very, very good. All the fish was fresh, buttery and melt in your mouth.  There did not seem to be any shortcuts because it was AYCE or that is was lunch.  So many choices on the menu so be adventurous, but not glutinous or you will have to pay extra (see the bottom of the menu I attached).  We are here for five days and my husband is looking forward to going back during our trip.  It is off the strip, but totally worth the cab ride over.  Excellent between food and value.",

Between the Yelp reviews I scoured and our very helpful server (shout out to a former Bay Area dweller) we had one tasty plate after another. We went on a Monday night and we waited under 5 minutes to be seated. The place was clean, the seafood was fresh,  and the portions were exactly what one might expect for sushi.   We shared the Uni, Ikura, Pork Belly, Superman, Green Mussels, Salmon Lover Roll, Wet Dream, Double Dragon, The Shit, and Baked Lobster Roll. Great names, right? Although I wasn't thrilled by the hot dishes with cream cheese (and I LOVE cream cheese), I think it's worth trying at least one unconventional creamy hot dish. Having a single plate of each one of our choices was ample making the few items that only allow one request per person insignificant because we didn't feel deprived or cheated in any way.   This place was definitely worth the taxi ride to/from the strip. This is a great place for a foodie challenge, I recommend taking an open minded partner or group. If I end up in Vegas with another sushi lover I'll definitely introduce them to this spot on a Monday night.",

    "text": "The quality of fish and variety was really good  they even even  have belly salmon and uni but they limit u to one per customer. The ALL YOU CAN EAT @$21 lunch and $26 dinner is respectable.  There are a few problems however.  Foremost, there was a wait to be seated cause it's not a huge place and this was on a Wednesday evening. Next , the service was pretty slow.  Again, it was really busy so we didn't mind that much. Don't order baked things unless u rlly want a wait as they only have one oven.   The thing that really stunk was the NBA Finals were on and they have two TVs that only show USB stuff. No cable. It was showing some cooking dvd which is just unacceptable to me and why we can't go back til they have it.     I put it #3 in AYCE in Vegas for now",

I'd say the servers are slow to seat people (could be intentional), but we'd definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas!",

I like how the nigiri sushi at this place gives roughly double the size of fish with about half the size of rice when compared to traditional sushi. All the sushi I tried was fresh and delicious. They menu is large and if you're not in the mood for sushi, they also offer food items like chicken katsu, teriyaki beef, udon, etc. I do feel that there are other AYCE sushi restaurants with a larger menu compared to this place. My only complaint is that although the servers are very friendly and helpful, service is slow. Overall, good experience and worth a try.",

The sushi was unique and it's the most memorable AYCE sushi I've tried. We were also lucky to be able to sit next to the cherry blossom tree. However, they were just really busy and forgot a few of my orders but it's understandable. Overall, the pros are tasty and special sushi with a fun environment. The downsides was the long wait and how busy and loud it was.",

The first likeable thing is that we were quickly given a table eventhough it's a Friday night. I also liked that there's enough space between tables so my husband and I can actually talk and enjoy the food without being unintentionally bothered by other customers' conversations. Staff are courteous and prompt, too.  We liked the baked green mussels, shrimp tempura, garlic tuna, Bam-Bam (and I can't rember the other one). The seafood salad and hamachi kama are alright but would not be on top of mind. Too bad those two are our usual cravings. Other than that, the place is good.  #",

Living in south summerlin area I usually don't travel too far out for food usually stay within 10 mins of my area, but this little gem was all worth every bite. If your looking for a place similar to Oyshi but on the east side of the strip this place is it. Actually this place was worth the drive for sure.  We came in around 6:30 the line was about 20 mins wait. And thankfully we did because at 7pm there was a huge line out the door. It's not a really big restaurant either so maybe that's why they had a wait but try to go early is always the best.  My fav things.... Ahi poke chips( had 4 orders it was that good) Super white tuna had this garlic sauce was delish  Monkey brain really yummy and different.  Bulgogi nachos was good but the chips were kinda stale to me.  And than our usual platter of unagi, salmon, white tuna, ahi tuna, yellowtail, sweet shrimp.  Quality and freshness was good.  Only thing I didn't like was they only sold can soda so they want you to buy more but it might have a been a good thing cause I didn't need more than one anyway.  I'll make this trip again soon.",

    "text": "This place is definitely worth the trip off the strip. $25 AYCE is just amazing. There's a huge variety of rolls and nigiri that they offer, and they don't even mind if you order 60 of something (we had a group of 12 and some of us were really ambitious....). The staff were all very pleasant and accommodating, especially for how many people we had and how much we ordered!   The fish to rice ratio was perfect!! I could wrap the fish back around the rice, which is so much more than can be said about most sushi places, much less AYCE. I also really appreciated that they actually made the effort to bring the nigiri out quickly enough that the fish would still be relatively cold, but the rice still warm! Unfortunately, the sushi rice didn't really hold up too well, but I guess I ain't complaining if I didn't want to eat that much rice anyway.  My favorite rolls were the Screaming O, Something Wrong, and Burning Your Ass (LOL.). There were some rolls we ordered I really wanted to try (like all the other spicy rolls) but our group was weaksawce and ordered way too much of a few of the same things so we had to cancel a bunch of orders in the end. Guess it'll have to wait for next time I'm in Vegas!",

This place has a few things going against it (location and signage) but the sushi, price and service outshines the odds.  The price is less than $25 for all you can eat and the sushi is served with little rice! That's my favorite part. We didn't eat big gobs of rice every piece. I'm into \"cooked\" sushi while my boyfriend eats the real sushi. We both left happy because there were enough items for both of us. Lots of options for the \"cooked\" sushi eaters like me. The service is great too. We've been back a few times since.  The inside could use a facelift so don't be discouraged when you walk in.",

    "text": "Why didn't I know about this place earlier?!  Okay, well for starters I almost gave up since the sign outside still says Kabuki and not Sakana!  I was actually already going to take one star off for the fact I drove around and around...until I read a little yelp tip that finally led me to this treasure.  When we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if we wanted a table or sushi bar....I said table, but the sushi bar chef yelled sushi bar at the hostess and apparently he calls the shots =P  Eating at the sushi bar was definitely an advantage, we called off our orders to the chef and he made them on the spot!   For starters this place has AYCE for $22.95...cheapest AYCE in Vegas that I know of.  So most important part of AYCE is freshness and the rice to fish ratio for the sushi.  I swear there were not more than 20 kernels of rice per piece of fish!  I would equate this to almost eating sashimi with the small amount of rice per piece.  The salmon, white tuna, unagi, seared tuna were all extremely fresh and well prepared.  Okay, so the best part is how they sear off the tuna and unagi with a blow torch....it was still piping hot when I consumed it, pure heaven! The specials that day were salmon belly and toro steak....again more bites of perfection!  We tried a few rolls that were on their dinner/one time only part of the AYCE menu as well.  The towering sashimi poke with wonton crisps...I could have just sat there and eaten that all night, cripsy wonton shell with fresh fish and a touch of acidity....too bad we were limited to one order per person =(.  We also tried their Screaming O and the Sashimi Roll, both of which were well prepared as well.  The only thing I honestly did not like....the plum ice cream (this was slightly atrocious to be since it reminded me of the pink amoxicillin (antibiotic) medication I had as a child that they tried to disguise with some unknown flavor.  But, minor flaw given they have plenty of other options for dessert.  Make sure you look at their updated menus on the counter as well....the one that is laminated that they hand you is missing a few items.  If you love AYCE sushi....you have to try this place out.  I say comparable to Goyemon/Sushi Mon for a lower price and less rice =)",

    "text": "Came here with a friend after a craving for fish on a Sunday afternoon.  Sakana is located in the corner of a shopping center with Target on Maryland Ave; sort of easy to miss because it's tucked in the corner.  The place isn't big, but not crammed in any way.    We decided on the AYCE sushi option, as the menu is vast.  The only downside is that there isn't really any sashimi; or rather, the sashimi is not just simple raw cuts of fish, but instead sashimi dressed up in sauces, fruits or veggies.  However, there are definitely many different interesting rolls to try, and they were quite good.  I'm more of a nigiri and sashimi eater, but I definitely like rolls as well.  All in all, the fish here is just average, but the rolls were definitely creative, nicely presented, and tasty.  The cooked food was actually the best part of the menu surprisingly; the pork belly and tempura calamari was top-notch.    Have I been to a better AYCE sushi buffet at 24.95?  You bet.  But this one's not bad and will do for a pinch if you're in the area.",

    "text": "\"Why me, Jesus? WHY ME!?\"   So I didn't actually say that, but THAT'S HOW I FELT after eating here when everybody else apparently had the time of their lives. We rolled in on a Friday night and saw the below -   + Party of a lot of people in the dining room. OK, a crowd is a good sign. + Seats at the sushi bar. On a Friday night with no wait? I'll take it.  + Huge fish to rice ratio. That's my attempt at \"low carb.\"   We sat down at the sushi bar and our server came by with our drinks pretty quickly, and we hit the ground running with our orders. At this point in the story, it's important to note that on a Friday night with a massive group that took up half of the restaurant, there were only two sushi chefs. Not for the sushi bar. I mean, for the whole place.   I gave them the benefit of the doubt for the first few orders because I knew that a group of that size could definitely put a dent in the operation. But after our requests kept getting sidetracked time after time, it became frustrating as we saw our orders get plated with more focus on the presentation than the service speed...only to see it get served to someone else. This was on top of the fact that a few of our orders were also \"lost\" - not just at the sushi bar, but in the kitchen too. Those bulgogi nachos that I finally mustered up the courage to try? I'll never know how they tasted because they never hit the table.   Ehh, so maybe this was an isolated incident - I can see that happening. I'm willing to give it another shot, but with so many other AYCE sushi options available around town, it's going to be a while before I swing by again.",

We went for the AYCE offer they had, and I can tell you the food and service was amazing!!!  And it's worth every penny and then some.  Everything we tried was delicious that I cannot even tell you what my favorite item even was.   Only downfall is the seats, we were seated against the wall and the seats were all pretty benches, however, it was very uncomfortable.  A small cushion is provided, but made no difference.  If they had better comfortable seats I would have given this place 5 stars.  But our overall experience with the food and service overcame this.    I will be back.... Regularly!!!!",

Based on the yelp reviews, it sounded like a good place, but this is one of those times that yelp had done me wrong :(  Came here about a month ago for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night.  Probably will not be back.  Service wasn't bad, but the quality of the sushi and fish just isn't worth it.  It's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland, in the Target complex.  It was a little difficult to find, because there was no actual sign that read Sakana.  From what I remember, I think the restaurant used to be called \"Kabuki.\"  I think that sign was still up.    Anyway, there was 6 of us.  When we walked in, there were a bunch of empty tables that had yet to be cleaned up--maybe low on staff?  There's a sushi bar and a few TVs that played some Asian pop music videos.  Quite entertaining to watch lol!  We were seated shortly after one of the employees had a chance to clear up one of the tables.  She promptly brought us our beer and water as we requested (I remember them having beer specials--I think a 2 for 1 deal), but it felt like it took forever to order and get our food.  We ordered a variety of things from the menu--rolls, appetizers, nigiri.  The food was less than mediocre.  One of the things we had ordered (I can't quite remember, I think it was the albacore) was fishy--to the point where I had to spit it up into my napkin.  Mind you, I love sushi. I know my sushi. And I take pride in the fact that I know the difference in quality.  The appetizers weren't bad.  I liked the chicken and the mussels.  Other than that, I felt pretty let down.  And I felt like I let my friends down for suggesting the place :(... Oh well, ya win some, ya lose some. Probably won't be back again.",

The AYCE is 20 for lunch and 22 for dinner, one of the better ayce deals in town.  However, this is one of the few places you can fill up without using the AYCE.  Rolls were all marked 1/2 off on the printed menu so you could get a 4 piece roll for 4.95 and an 8 pc special roll for 8.95.  Someone who is full after 2 or 3 rolls can slide in under $22.00 and still manage to taste several different items.  I tried the roll called \"the Sh$T\"  It is really good.  I would get it again.  The waitress explained what was in it but I didn't pay attention. Something about crab, special sauce deep fried, blah blah.  I also had the soft shell crab appetizer which was part of the AYCE.  It was good, but not great.  For rolls I had a red dragon, a baked scallop roll (4pc) and the last roll, I can't remember its name but it was awesome, the best roll I had all day.  THis is definitely going into my rotation.",

    "text": "Had to try this place after the such high ratings given by other Yelpers. I have to say it was a little disappointing.  First, the pros:  Service was great. The sushi chef was super friendly and attentive, as was the wait staff. If you have a chance to talk to Chef Sai, by all means do so.   The price for their AYCE is definitely the best in the valley, given the selection.  Now, the cons:  Not only is this restaurant far from me, the signage is also incorrect. Luckily it was the only sushi restaurant in the shopping mall.  The food was really hit and miss. The nigiri and other sushi was fine. The selection of nigiri and rolls is similar to other AYCE sushi restaurants. The selections from the grill however, were just terrible. I remember ordering the grilled shishito peppers, a favorite dish of mine. The shishito peppers I got that day were sooo salty it made my eyes water.   So, the price and service are a big draw, but because of the food and location, I won't make any special trips out there.",

    "text": "I'm all about all you can eat places and I must admit if this place was in SD it would totally obliterate the AYCE game. Came here on one of my vegas trips, we decided to stop by before checking in our hotel. The menu was very scattered and it was hard to interpret some areas but I think it's because they have so many options. I would say 4x more options then your neighborhood AYCE restaurant. Some of my favorite appetizers were the fried pork belly and bulgogi nachos. I had the orange blossom roll which is a great starting roll and then I followed it up with the golden tiger roll which I have to say is one of the best roll I've ever had. My friends ordered a bunch of nigiri and they all taste fresh and authentic. The texture and portion of the fish they put on top is larger than most which I think is awesome. The nigiri that stood out the most was the salmon nigiri, definitely recommend! What sets these guys apart from the rest is they have a dessert section for their AYCE, which is unheard of. I got the mini honey toast topped with ice cream. Dessert sections for AYCE are dangerous! lol. Besides the menu being all over the place I noticed the restaurant was obviously short staffed with the waitresses looking like they are running around with their heads chopped off. You feel really bad for them and can't even get mad because it is AYCE and everyone is ordering every minute. I will make coming here a tradition every time I arrive in Las Vegas!",

My favorite is their nigiri, especially their super white tuna. must try! Sushi Rice is perfectly cooked and seasoned, Appetizers are good too, spicy edadmame, Grilled hamachi,  pork belly, the shit are good. nigiris are the best in their menus. sushi chef cuts fishes well that size of the fish hugs the rice perfectly. Good fish quality, great knife skills for the sushi chefs (which affects the taste of nigiri).   On the other hand,  I deducted 2 stars for their \"unfriendly services\" from the servers. I eat here atleast twice a month because they have the best nigiri so far for ayce. everytime I come, Servers are either, ignoring you, rushing you to finish your meal so they can close early, they always forget 1-3 of our orders everytime I come here. The old lady server never smiles at you and she has a resting bitch face so that never helps and I asked a question of how long our group can be seated, she cut me off before I can finish my questions and with an annoyed look she says \"just wait okay?\"    I would always comeback for the sushi but I would never leave a good tip for a lousy server.",

Our server often times forgot things that we ordered even though we politely reminded him a few times and then he accused of of stealing a can of soda. They charge per can here and he swore that he put a certain number on the table even thought we showed him the empty cans that we had (only a few people had anything other than water) and then when we told him that we were told it was free refills (because we asked) he made us point out and call over the sever  who told us that information. SUPER AWKWARD.  it was a a $0.50 can of soda that he THINKS that he put at our table. We told him \"what do you want to see our purses? To prove we arent hiding another can\". it was a little ridiculous. Then when we were paying some of us just paid together to make it easier on him to not have to split so many checks (there were 6 of us) and then he came back to ask if we had all paid...like WTF?! First the soda then checking to make sure all the bills were paid instead of checking with the cashier.....I was done. We arent sketchy looking people at all that one business owner might be worried about. We were a group of well dressed ladies  25-50 looking to go out after work .   **ALSO, just saw they were on dirty dining less than a week ago. so BEWARE. Someone posted the link that showed the pictures of fish being left out and the area not being clean**",

Got our initial orders in for our party of 6 and their servers forget things like hot water and lemons even though there were multiple servers that checked to see if drinks had been ordered. Hint: this becomes a trend. Furthermore when the servers brought our food, they wouldn't say the name of what it was, and when we inquired, they would give us a look as if it was some outlandish request before muttering the name.  Food is mostly average and the only thing that stood out were the giant pieces of straight up bone in our yellow tail tuna nigiri. How is that even possible???? Lastly, our 3rd or 4th orders were conveniently missing things. By that point, the place was reaching capacity, and all the above issues was informed to our server. Unimpressed with the food and service,  we decided not to reorder and we didn't think we were missing out on much.   The review sounds nit picky, but these were the things that absolutely stood out and brought it to my current rating. Give this place a try if you've exhausted all other dining options.",

I came in with a good friend and my FH. The place was pretty packed with about two tables open. We were told it would be a wait and a party that came after us was seated before us. I think they stepped out and we're waiting as well. There was still one table available but the wait staff were quite busy and sat us almost 25 minutes later at the open table that was available the entire time.  \\_()_/  It took a few minutes to get water and menus and all three of us were going for AYCE sushi. I'd say every roll we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. They were out of salmon kama and oysters which was a bummer. My favorite was the little tease roll, it had spicy tuna and cucumber inside and was topped with Cajun tuna, deep fried onion and jalapeno with spicy mayo, garlic ponzu and eel sauce. So effing delicious! My boyfriend had almost every nigiri on the menu and he was impressed with the rice to fish ratio, big portion of fish to rice! Nice! All the rolls were not stuffed with rice and we really did some damage and were not stuffed quickly as they give good portion of rice to fish in all their rolls. Service was lacking. We had to ask many times for water and had to fall down our waiters to order more rolls. Even though service was pretty bad I would still come back because the sushi was that amazing.We definitely didn't browse the menu as much as we should have and next time I will be ordering the things is skipped out on my first visit here because I will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Confession time.  Let's get this out of the way: Before Sakana, my sushi experiences were limited. How limited? As limited as a grocery store. Shameful as it may be it's the truth. And that's not the worst part. I thought I was getting some really great quality items because these grocery stores came full stocked with what appeared to be a genuine sushi chef behind a small pane of glass displaying their craft. Needless to say, my bar of comparison was low prior to trying Sakana for the first time. But thanks to Sakana it is now so much higher. How did I go so many years without going out for Sushi?! Fast forward a bit and now I've visited Sakana thrice in the last month or so. Why go anywhere else for sushi? Every visit I have opted for the AYCE option and it's been worth every penny. With 3 visits under my belt I've had the opportunity to try a multitude of offerings.  Some standouts have been: The Shit, which I regrettably skipped over my first time but will never visit without ordering again. The \"dipping sauce\" that is paired with it is really what sets it apart. I swear this sauce can be used on basically anything on their menu, or any other menu for that matter, and make it that much better. Try it, don't make my rookie mistake. The Bulgogi Nachos struck me as counterintuitive amongst the other items on their menu but I finally tried them and they were some of the best \"nachos\" I've had. It's served in a small bowl but I could eat a standard full-size-nacho servings worth of these things. The beef is tender and delicious, and the spicy sauce again sets it apart.  The Nigiri options are pretty extensive and the cuts of meat are hefty and taste fresh. The Unagi and octopus stand out as some of my favorites.  The rolls offered vary in style, size and just about every one I've tried has pleased my palette. For deep fried rolls the Golden California is a safe choice, simply a deep fried Philly roll but it doesn't disappoint. Monkey Brains is a more unique deep fried option with banana being a focal point of it's components. While it wasn't bad it was one of my least favorite rolls.  The Something Wrong, No Name, and Mexican Roll standout in my brain as far as specialty rolls go.  Being of such rookie sushi-eatin status the baked rolls were somewhat new to me but such a great discovery. The lobster lasagna, baked lobster roll and the Wet Dream are just the right size for AYCE patrons. And yes they're delicious.  Service here has been on point for the majority of my 3 visits so far. We have a 1 year old and like some of his peers he can get grumpy and the waitstaff on multiple occasions have done a great job with giving him extra attention to keep him happy. This is huge for me because I hate feeling like we're bothering other diners and they definitely made us feel welcome. Big PLUS in my book.  Yes, I have nothing to compare it to (why venture away from greatness?) so perhaps my review isn't as worthy. BUT...I have a mouth. I've used it to eat lots of food. My taste buds work. And through the magic of science beyond my understanding I am able to distinguish between what tastes good and what doesn't.  Sakana tastes good.",

It was so fantastic that we ended up getting two orders. We also had the 911 roll and the little teaser which were hot and spicey  (which we loved!). We also got the Hawaiian, which tasted like wonderful poke, and the QA roll (again, wonderful!). We paid a la carte, but they have an all you can eat option which may be cheaper depending on how much you order, but they will charge you for anything you don't eat, so be aware. I highly recommend this place!!!",

A little inconsistent with stuff though, like the first time they charged my 12 yr old only childs price so it really was an amazing deal and was excited to go back. Went back 2 days later before had to leave Vegas and they charged him full price, that was disappointing. First time we got different flavors of mochi, another time they said we were only allowed one piece. Ugh!",

The rice ratio is perfect, not too much so you really taste the fish and other additions they put into the rolls. They have awesome appetizers - you must order The Shit and The Pang! Both are mouthwatering! And to cap off your meal, they have a great dessert selection. Check this place out! You won't regret it!",

The sushi is fresh and very flavorful. I would give it 5 stars but I've only been twice and the second time i came to eat here we got there around 9pm and they close at 11 so we figured good about of time for dinner. We were ordering a la carte but seemed like we were being a bit rushed almost couldn't enjoy my talk with my friends during dinner. But im hoping this isnt happening again next time i go. Theres alot of parking space its in the same shopping center as target. So looking for a new sushi place try it out ! I'll be back hoping to have a better experience because the food is delicious!",

The food is worth the wait. We were almost hangry. The Monkey Brain roll is a MUST. Absolutely underrated and I wanted to dislike it but had to try it! I'm coming back just for it! I work on the strip as well and this is my second time here. I'm impressed even when things took a while. Give it a try if you have the time and tip well! They deserve it! Also, David is exceptional! Thank you!",

Try the appetizers, will start off the meals well.   For all those who have yet visited this location, keep in mind this is not a five star restaurant. It's a okay-size sushi place. Don't pass judgement by the locations looks, instead concentrate on their food. The quality of service and the experience. You'll find Sakana to be one of those satisfying sushi places here in Las Vegas. I came once out of curiosity. I come weekly to eat and enjoy the place, and do some homework",

My friend and I went with ayce and honestly I am still thinking about their ebi and seared lemon salmon. Some items can only be ordered once during dinner (i.e. their delicious ebi and oysters). Their nigiri comes in sets of 2, which is great for sampling their options. Additionally, the nigiri has awesome fish to rice ratio. There was only a small ball of rice for the very generous amount of fish.",

I ask the waiter if I can get small slice of lemons on top of each squid nigiri and when I tasted them OMG it reminded of what I missed in Japan. Not the exact but was very close!

They're tucked away in the corner so be sure to watch out when driving there. Their price is the same or average at all the other AYCE sushi places in Vegas. Rolls come out fairly quick & the service has been good so far. Our favorites to order as usual are super white, yellowtail, garlic tuna, tuna, Lisa Lisa, Dragon, Hawaiian, baked mussels & too many others to name. Oh & they also offer half rolls!",

We arrived on a Tuesday eight when they opened about 15-20 almost all the tables were filled.  Great atmosphere good service compared to others around. We waited no longer than 5 minutes to be greeted and asked if we we're ready of course we were.    Started with the lobster roll which was amazing. Then the spider roll, bacon lobster kaibab (more bacon taste couldn't taste the lobster), chicken fried rice. Now let me tell you something it was the best rice I've ever had. A few more rolls but since there were only two of us we couldn't try everything. U suggested going with a big group and just sharing everything so you get a chance to try it all.     Desert was as expected great I had the fried bananas which was great wife got the Mango Mochi. This is a great Vegas location and I see why the rating is so high. If you are looking for a new A.Y.C.E sushi ($21 for lunch $25 for dinner) look no futher.",

Food is good. Price is good. Staff okay.  Here's where they lost stars. Checked in to put our name down for 7 people.  They have a standard answer of 30 minutes. Didnt matter that they had a bunch of large parties before us.  But I trusted they knew what they were doing. Not so. After 30 minutes, we weren't much closer to being seated. They told my son-in-law that we have to check back every 30 minutes to see the status.  Left and went to Oyshi. No wait. Food was great. And we ended up spending  less money because unlike Sakana, they were fair in charging us for the kids. The last time we were at Sakana, they charged us the ala carte price for my grandson's multiple orders of tamago sushi. Came out to the price of an adult \"All You Can Eat\" price! My grandson just turned 6 years old!!!",

For the super reasonable price of $25.95, you have access to all of the sushi your heart desires. I really recommend focusing on the nigiri because they give big pieces of fish and it tastes so fresh! My favorite are the seared lemon salmon, the super white tuna, the garlic tuna, the cajun tuna, the ocean trout, and the uni. Every single piece of fish is PACKED with flavor and each bite got me dancing in my seat. If you want to order appetizers, I recommend the shit, the pang, and the baked mussels (however, they can be pretty filling and heavy) I would skip out on the yakatori. I always crave this place and I'm so happy I found my go to sushi place. A definite MUST TRY if you're in the city!!",

This time was the same except it was more like \"it's good/ ok with some hit and miss dishes.\"  The nigiri they serve comes with a huge piece of fish.   While this is great for a value point of view it's not easy to eat.  Not to be a snob but sushi should be eaten in one bite and these bites are huge.  I mean the yellowtail came with 2 slices!   I had to eat one as sashimi because I saw my bf spit out his piece (not because it didn't taste good but because it was just too much raw fish in the mouth.)  The best part of the menu is the extensive appetizer section.  This is a great place to bring a group and have all different items.   And the call 911 roll is pretty darn good!   I usually don't order rolls but this one was great!  Don't think I'll be back soon because there are better choices out there for me but I wouldn't say no if friends wanted to go.",

On my dad's high recommendations, after getting our things settled in the hotel, my good friend picked us up and off we were to SAKANA.  She's an older woman that recently moved to Vegas so if she could find this spot then anyone can lol.  We used the GPS so if I had to find it again I wouldn't be able to tell you where unless I had my phone...  Parking was easy to find nearby for us but I can say the parking was pretty full.  Lots of other shops/restaurants and I don't think the parking lot is all that big.  So when we got in we were seated right away, yay!  It's actually quite small inside.  So with our party of four, I did feel a little cramped.  Right off the bat we knew we were gonna do the AYCE so we went straight to ordering any and everything, no joke.  The waitress didn't know what to do with herself lol.  In no time, our table was overflowing with sushi rolls, chicken karaage, nigiris, and other random things that caught our eyes.  Among all the items on the menu, there were a couple of things that were designated, one order per person.  And definitely note that if you fail to consume all orders, it would be charged ala carte.  All in all, for the price, the AYCE is definitely worth every delicious bite!  Just as my dad praised this restaurant, so do I.",

I've always wanted to go to, and tonight was it. We came at 6pm with another couple and everything from food, service to drinks was on fucking point. Our bill was 150 for 4 and everyone was full and buzzed( well.... I drank the most alcohol) one Sapporo and 3 jars of sake. Just good ol fashion fresh food and speedy service. The bad news is when we left at 8p there was 20 people waiting in the parking lot for a table. So.... the moral of the story is when you're over 40 and old like us; eating at 6pm gets you a table.  it's Better than waiting an hour+ at 8pm... so Get here early!",

The Philadelphia roll and their regular dragon roll was really good though. Again, good rice to other ingredients ratio.  I'm a wuss so I thought the Red dragon roll was a little too spicy haha.   I vote for the affogato, green tea panna cotta, and honey toast desserts!   As always, great customer service. Prompt timing for orders to come out. Recommended all over again! A++++",

Food was good as always but the chef must have tweaked the recipes a bit because the deliciousness was elevated to another level! Spice level was cranked up and at the right levels!

It is an AYCE or pay by the plate but if you eat enough, it is worth it to do the AYCE.  My favorite nigiri was the Yuzu yellowtail nigiri and it was perfection! I liked it because the nigiri fish were nice and cold, fresh and just the perfect size on top of the rice. I liked the rice too because it wasn't too sticky like regular sushi rice but it was a bit fluffy and the piece of rice was about an inch long- perfect so you don't get full off of rice!  You can order rolls as well but be aware that if you don't finish it, you'll have to pay for it so order slow. The rolls are hearty sized rolls and they don't have fillers like cream cheese. It is heavy on rice so watch out for that.  I loved that for the AYCE, you can order any appetizer, rolls or nigiri on the menu. They did have ones specific for dinner only or ones that was a one time order, so I suggest trying that because it is worth it!  For appetizer, they have one called \"the shit\"- basically 2 small egg roll like roll that is mixed with a warm crab mixture and mayo with a spicy mayo and eel sauce and their \"pang\" is a house special! The \"pang\" is basically 2 small pieces of garlic toast with a creamy crab mixture topped with what tastes kinda like melted cheese. We got 4 orders of pang!!! Try the baked mussels as well- not too much mayo as a filler but just enough.   The ice cream is AYCE but their speciality dessert is only one per person. You need to check out their honey toast with green tea ice cream!!!  All in all, I am going to come back here again for their sushi! It's a great price and great quality!",

My favorite used to be Goyemon but they got really popular so the wait was always super long, they increased their prices to I think $26.99 for dinner and their fish to rice ratio is horrible now compared to before. Anyway...  Lunch ends at 3 and is only $20.95! We came at 2:30 and there were only 5 other tables in the restaurant. Service was great, sushi came out really really quick, dirty dishes were always taken away and waters were always refilled.   Sushi tasted fresh, and they give you HUGE slices of fish. I think my only complaint is that the fish slices should be a little less thick because it's so difficulty to shove the entire thing in your mouth. Also the sweet sauces that they use on some of the rolls can be a bit too overwhelming. Other then that, good selection of rolls, limited appetizers (get the mussels and potbelly!), not AYCE dessert but by the end of your meal you'll be too full to care I promise.   The unagi was soooo good. I tried the white tuna and didn't like it but my bf loved it, saying it's rare that an AYCE place would offer it. Of course I'm a salmon lover and ordered a bunch of salmon rolls. Yes you can order half rolls here!! Another review mentioned something about them charging extra for appetizers before dinner. That didn't happen when I went. One complaint I did have was that we had to ask for our miso soup 3 times! I thought they didn't have any but they just forgot about it.   This will be my go to spot from now on!!",

They also have a few items that are very similar to Yama and other sushi places.  The staff is friendly and service is fast! It's been our go-to sushi place ever since.  Update: I initially gave this place 4 stars but after my last experience with them, I decided to give them 5 stars instead.  I took my friend to eat here as she's never tried this place before. She was blown away on how fresh the sushi was. Also, the the nigiri that we ordered all had a nice thick slice of fish! They definitely are not stingy. We enjoyed our meal very much and customer service was great as usual.",

Usually I always order nigiri and maybe just one roll when I come for ayce. Anyways i tried this place and to me it's very delicious I love it here. Fresh servings of tuna and salmon are great. Will definitely visit this place with some group of friends and see how they will like it.",

The newest edition I have found that amazes me and is the best baked roll I have ever eaten is called the  \"Michael Feel Dirty Roll\".  It's a must have.

    "text": "Overall the food is good but this is the first sushi place I actually have to spit out fish scales. With that, I would have given this place a four-star but unfortunately, like other Yelpers pointed out here, the customer service needs some work. It is not that the waiters are not friendly but more that they have no idea what they are doing. Our large party made a reservation over the weekend and when we showed up, we were told that our table was given to someone else couple of hours ago and the waitress have expected them to finish in time, only that they haven't. We were cool with that since the older lady waitress did look very apologetic about the situation and the place was super busy during that time. Once we were finally seated, the server for our table started asking us what we would like to order for appetizers without giving us menus; when we asked for menu, he said they currently ran out and would get back to us. Some time later he gave us one menu for our large party where we got to share around the table. No problem, we are nice people and we were in a good mood but things just kept getting disappointing when we put in our orders but not everything was served. One of my friend who did not get AYCE was not served anything until I pointed out to the waitress. By the end of the night, we just gave up on waiting for few things we ordered more than two hours ago. On the whole, the wait time for dishes to come out was longer than other places. The lady waitress (probably the owner?) did try to make it by serving us \"special\" dishes but the overall atmosphere was just ruined by the rest of the other servers who are disorganized and have no idea what they are doing.   Thus, the AYCE is delicious at this place, 4/5 stars but the customer service is about 2/5. Hope the owner train the servers more and maybe that will gain this place more positive points. My favorite sushi place and AYCE is Jjanga --- great food and customer service!",

    "text": "Quick service and surprisingly good sushi for an ayce sushi restaurant. I would try to come here with a good appetite so you can get your money's worth.       How the ayce works is you just order off the menu and they take your orders, instead of a buffet where you grab a plate and fill it with sushi. I think this is better than buffet style, since what you are getting hasn't been sitting out and is very fresh.      Most of the items we tried was good. I really enjoyed the assorted nigiri such as the yellowtail and trout. The fish to rice ratio is actually quite good and they put big pieces on top of small piles of rice.       We actually tried to avoid eating too many rolls (since we thought it would fill us up too fast bc of the rice) but the chef's no. 1 roll was really tasty. I also thought their seafood salad and sashimi rolls were excellent (unfortunately it's a one time order for ayce)      The downside I found is that I would avoid anything with lobster. They tend to mix the lobster with a lot of imitation crab and mayo so you don't really taste the lobster. Actually, all their crab items are really just imitation crab mixed with lots of mayo.       Some other items I wouldn't bother with was the bulgogi nachos. (Way too much mayo on the nachos) The desserts weren't bad but I felt the tempura ice cream was way too much fried batter with just whipped cream on top.       Also, if you think you can get away with not eating the rice stuck to the nigiri, think again. They have an extra charge for rice that goes uneaten.       Overall, it was a decent place to pig out off the strip in Las Vegas. Definitely a solid ayce sushi restaurant.",

    "text": "Ooh I'm torn on this one. Basically comes down to the food being 5 star worthy, but the service was in the 1-2 star range.   Pros: All the food was amazing! The bacon wrapped     asparagus was delicious, albeit small. The rolls all tasted super fresh and delish. The BOGO beer and sake specials (not sure if it's a specific time, but we were told about it, so we partook!)  We were told a wait time of 30 minute, but only ended up waiting about 10 min.  Cons: Service was not so hot. We were all almost constantly out of water, with refills coming every 15 minutes or so. Might not seem like a long time, but when you're thirsty and want a beverage with your food, it's a real long time. Super unenthusiastic between every server we encountered. No sense of urgency. Not a big place either mind you, and they were plenty well-staffed.   Overall, it would be a toss up to come back. The food was really good, but the service makes it not worth frequent visits.",

I tried to order the ones with less rice because I didn't want to get too full. For the price the buffet is definitely a better choice. It's so worth it. You must try.

If you're into spicy food like I am, then the spiciest roll would be Call 911, just because it has habanero sauce in it. As for appetizers, my favorite is the Dragon Balls, which are stuffed mushrooms. Their sushi is also great because the ratio between the fish and rice is perfect. They do not put too much rice. This is my go to sushi place and it's also very convenient for UNLV students since it's so close by.",

The service is awesome, it seemed like every time we finished an order our waitress was there to take another order. Food also was quick to our table. The rice served with the nigiri is small compared to other AYCE restaurants. Will definitely return.",

    "text": "I happened to be around the area and decided to check this place out due to good word of mouth. Sakana used to be Kabuki, but quite honestly the change to Sakana was a good change.  The first thing was that the sushi chefs were really attentive and made lots of small talk. My plate and cup weren't empty for long after I had finished my food or drink.  I tried about every type of nigiri they had besides 2-3 of the items that I tend not to try in any sushi place and I must say every piece was fresh. The sauces that came along with the nigiri complimented each piece of fish very nicely. I also liked the fact that the tako was cut thinner than in most other places. I prefer not to spend 5 minutes trying to break down a piece of octopus.  The rolls in the menu were also quite varied and I managed to try the baked lobster roll and a tempura/eel roll. Both rolls were quite good and I would have tried a few more, but by that time I was getting full on nigiri.   Overall though Sakana was really good and I encourage people to give it a shot. I've tried quite a few places and I can say that Sakana is up there in terms of Vegas AYCE. Hopefully they can keep it up because if they do there will be another solid ayce spot in town.",

Always the freshest fish in Las Vegas tastes just like catching it from the ocean!",

    "text": "SAKANA IS DEFINITELY MY TOP 3 AYCE SUSHI PLACE IN VEGAS. I use to go here a lot because it was conveniently located next to UNLV, but after graduating I still make the trip because of the quality of fish, the QUANTITY OF FISH (which I will get to later), and the variety of rolls, nigiri, and appetizers they offer.   FOOD: I only eat nigiri so I can tell right away how fresh the fish is since it's served by the slice and not in hidden in the rolls. The texture is so smooth and the fish melts in your mouth, there is no weird fishy odor (which would indicate old fish), the color is perfect, and the taste of the fish is fresh for AYCE. Plus, the FISH-TO-RICE RATIO IS MIND-BLOWING. The slices are thick and it covers the itty bitty rice underneath which I greatly appreciate. I highly recommend the salmon, tuna, garlic tuna, unagi, ocean trout, and super white tuna. Aside from the sushi, the appetizers are very delicious. I recommend the shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and miso soup. The desserts are also bomb and they let you chose one speciality dessert and unlimited ice cream; I usually get the green tea ice cream and green tea panna cotta.   SERVICE: The servers are always nice, friendly, and attentive. We get our orders quickly even when it's busy, and the servers always refill our water before it's halfway empty.   OVERALL: Sakana is my definition of sushi heaven.",

They had the jalapeno yellowtail shashimi that was really good. I also like their screaming o special which is albacore tuna with a light sauce. My first experience had more sashimi selection and I thought the overall quality of fish was better.   The second time I went I really did not enjoy their special of ocean trout nigiri. It was super chewy and tendonous. I literally could not eat it. I took a bit and had to spit it back out. Some of the better things were salmon and super white tuna. The Uni wasn't fresh at all. I remember it tasting extremely fishy.   I don't think I'll be coming back here because there are plenty of other ayce sushi places in vegas to try.",

I'm not too familiar with Vegas, having only been there a few times and been only for conventions. A friend I was with suggested this place (apparently it was only a few blocks from the convention, it turned out it was a couple miles so quite a but of walking... not so happy feet.)  But it was worth it! I would walk all that way again! The sushi was honestly and sincerely amazing. It tasted super fresh and everything we had was absolutely delectable.  We ordered numerous rolls, I don't even remember which ones but we ordered maybe 8 - 10 different rolls. Word of warning, they are large. If you order the full roll, be ready. You have been warned. They ain't small! But man are they tasty! Some of the best sushi I've had. Seriously. And I LOVE sushi.  Oh, did I mention it's all you can eat?!?!",

    "text": "This place is well, average, as far as all you can eat sushi goes in Las Vegas.   I've eaten here twice. And both times I had something on the menu called \"the sh*t\" and it was absolutely FANTASTIC it is definitely a must have! The first time I dined here I did the all you can eat and while it was pricey, the fish is fresh and the rolls are tasty. The second time I did a la carte and only had two rolls but felt just as full as the all you can eat. The rolls here are somewhat unique (somewhat the same as Yama sushi across the street which I highly recommend) my main problem is it is very VERY hard to avoid fried rolls, or rolls with fried ingredients here. Which if you are gluten free, this restaurant would be impossible for you to eat at, which is uncommon for sushi places.  Besides the overabundance of everything fried, the service here is awful! When you walk in you often stand at the podium with a sheet of paper with names on it and no instructions for an indiscriminate amount of time. On my second visit I just wanted to sit at the bar and I asked if I still had to sign the sheet and the server wouldn't give me a clear answer. Turns out the answer is no. And with all you can eat, the slow service is definitely a hindrance! Even when I did the a la carte we were constantly trying to flag down our server because we needed something.  Overall this place is okay, but if you're looking for an all you can eat sushi experience I recommend somewhere else such as Yama sushi or sushi hero.",

The menu has a lot of options so regardless if you want raw or cooked, there's definitely multiple options to choose from.   It's all you can eat and everything is freshly made as you order. It also comes out pretty fast. There's about 2-4 pieces for some of the rolls and others come with 6-8 pieces. Definitely order a lot and share with everyone so you can try rolls you prob didn't think to order. My favorite roll was the monkey brain roll. The banana tempura on top added a subtle sweetness and crispy texture. The desserts are yummy too, so if you can try to save some room. If you're too full it's ok they are small, just take the bite. The green tea panna cotta is delicious. You won't regret it.   Definitely would go back here! We left stuffed and ended up in a food coma.",

    "text": "With lots of AYCE sushi options in LV, I was unaware which of the many was a good option. Seeing that Sakana was a popular choice with 4 stars, I placed my bet here hoping that it would be yummy. Dinner was $26 and since we came before 5:30PM we didn't have to wait in line. The restaurant was very cute looking with the decor but a little small.  The menu is extensive, like super big with so many choices from hand rolls to yakitori to hot rolls to nigiri to appetizer. I ordered all nigiri and was not disappointed in the fish quality and size! My favorites were the salmon belly, yellowtail, and squid. The Amai ebi (sweet shrimp) was great as well!!! The uni was bitter though and I wasn't a real fan. The only appetizer I got was the pork belly which was fatty and delicious!!   They offered many dessert options but they weren't super amazing. Ice cream was melted and the tempura ice cream was disappointing as the tempura surrounding the ice cream part was white bread deep fried. Tiramisu was a no-no but the housemade green tea panna Cotta was great though small.   The only big problem I had was that when I first ordered, they forgot to give me about half my orders. And so, I had to reorder that part all over again, which was pretty annoying. The servers were kind though and helpful and water was always refilled without asking.    If you're around the strip, this isn't too far off and is a great ayce option if you don't want to eat at a buffet!",

I don't know what everyone is talking about, maybe we got extremely unlucky, but there was soooo much rice!!!!  Our first round of the specials, Ocean Trout & Yellowtail Belly was very good and not a lot of rice like the rest of the reviewers, but the downside is it's only one order per person, which is crap!!!   There was one reviewer that said everything has sauce on it.   While that's not exactly True, it's pretty close and sooo sweet too.   Also, almost all rolls have the fake crab filler.   We were extremely disappointed with our experience.  We should have stuck to our regular place when we come to LV, but to be respectful, I will not mention/plug the other location.  Another note, if you like scallops, they don't have fresh scallops so be careful.  Would have only given one star but the staff were very nice and the fish was decent quality.  Not the best, not the worst.   The specials are great, but only one order, so that's why it's really fresh I suppose!   FYI - I don't normally do reviews as you can tell, but reviews from others are typically right on, this was so far off, I felt it necessary to warn my fellow Yelp'ers.",

Nothing to write home about but not bad enough for me to complain.  The lunch \"AYCE\" (All you can eat) special is $20 per person, a good value.  The decor is somewhat hip, with a black and white mural of a Japanese market.  Your tea will come in a charming mug with depictions of puffer fish.

They also offer 2 for 1 beers ALL day long!   I left this place beyond stuffed and extremely satisfied. I can't wait to go back!!!!",

    "text": "If you read my reviews, you know that I love my endless sushi.    Yesterday, after a failed attempt to see a new movie, and a really long drive, we found ourselves at Champagne's for a drink, and REALLY hungry...so I pulled up the trusty Yelp app, searched for All you can Eat Sushi, and found Sakana.  With a four and a half star rating, and .5 miles from where we were, this was the winner for dinner.  We walked in, and they were not busy, just a couple tables of people.   We chose to sit at the bar, to make things easier on ourselves.    The menu was big, with items that I don't usually see in other places (like a few lobster options.  WHA?!)  Yesterday we had:  Garlic Tuna Super White Cajun Albacore Unagi Ebi Smoked Paprikia Salmon Ocean Trout Scallop The X Man Hand roll Tako (Octopus) A Lobster Nigiri roll (can't remember the name right now) A lobster and bacon skewer Seafood salad Spicy garlic edemame Gyoza Egg Rolls Seaweed Salad Mini Honey Toast  So, the really good: The Garlic Tuna.  For me, this is just under the quality of Sumo Sushi's garlic tuna, which is the best I've ever had.   Sakana's was AWESOME.  Super garlicky, moist, and HUGE.  Yeah, let me take a moment to discuss the portion sizes. Ridiculous.  SO. MUCH. FISH. On the one hand, I was thrilled about this.  The fish to rice ratio is amazing here.  Small amount of rice, TONS of fish.   On the other hand...I was able to eat a lot less because the fish portion was basically doubled, so I hit my wall a lot faster than normal.   Also really good:   The Lobster nigiri roll:  lobster and crab with a bit of cream cheese (I think) was lovely.  Even my fella liked it, and he's not a fan of cream cheese.   The Smoked Paprika Salmon: I'm not usually a fan of salmon sushi, but this had great flavor.   The Scallop:  I was really stuffed by the time I ate this, but I'm so glad I did.  Delicious tender scallops on rice wrapped in seaweed, topped with a tiny slice of lemon:  mmm.   The X Man hand roll:  Soy paper, rice, beef and salsa, this was like a teriyaki burrito.  Fella didn't care for it, but I'd order it next time for sure.  Really tasty.  The Seafood salad:  Holy sashimi Batman!  TONS of fish, dicon radish, cucumbers, jalapenos...mmm.  and HUGE.      The Mini Honey Toast:  I got excited when I saw this dessert.  A favorite of mine, Honey Toast isn't something I am able to have very often...this was incredible.  We ordered mine, and my fella doesn't usually do dessert...but after one bite of mine, he ordered his own!  Now the good, but slightly different/strange: The Super White:  Fish was great, but they put screaming o sauce on it...for me, it took away a bit of the flavor of the fish, and my fella hated it.    The Ebi:  Delicious, but the small lemon slices on top added just a bit too much to the shrimp.  It brightened the flavor, but was a touch too much.   The Unagi:  DELICIOUS...but I don't know if they just have a different eel sauce, but this was more of a ponzu sauce.  So it was good, but not what I was expecting.   The Ocean Trout:  Good fish, good flavor, but the toppings were just a little...salsa like for me.  The Cajun Albacore was a little weird, with a crunchy topping that I've never seen before.   The good/Standard: Seaweed Salad Gyoza Eggrolls Lobster and bacon skewer Spicy Garlic Edemame.    All good, nothing spectacular or amazing.  The service here was on point.  Fast.  Friendly.  Everything you could ask for in a sushi restaurant, really.  I will absolutely eat here again.  There are lots of things on the menu that I want to try that I didn't have room for yesterday.   DInner is only $24.95, and apparently they have 2 for 1 sake and beer every day...I may try that out next time, since I didn't have a chance to yesterday.  All in all, a very good spot for endless sushi!",

    "text": "For the price, 5 stars!  We dined in for lunch, and were one of the first of the day. I didn't have any expectations of this place, except that I hoped for $25 it would be decent. They completely surpassed my expectations. Sushi is one of my favorite things to eat, but living the midwest I am limited in the places that have good quality fish, I am usually paying $25 for 2 great rolls at a legit place. So to pay $25 for all you can eat (affectionately dubbed ACYE), I was pretty much in Heaven.  We mainly stuck with Nigiri, and only did a few rolls and apps. I think we ate 15 orders of 2pc Nigiri each!!! The selection of fish is outstanding, and they will even let you order some of the more expensive cuts (toro etc) at least 2 times per person. I consider that pretty generous. Their \"signature\" sauce here was a garlic ponzu, and while it was mighty tasty on the first few orders, it got old really fast. You can ask for the fish and the rice plain for any of the nigiri, which we started doing after a couple of orders. The fish are a nice cut, and thick too. They aren't skimping on you here. They also have hand roll, maki, and baked rolls but we wanted to keep it simple that day.  Definitely recommended as an excursion off the strip if you love sushi and basic Japanese apps (agadashi tofu, kaarage etc). Also it was conveniently located next to a Target if you need to load up on anything while on your trip. We bought a case of water for the hotel room and it was a total hangover and hydrating money saver.",

THE ONE. Came here on a Saturday and this place was busy, but we managed to get a seat pretty quick. Just gotta let you know this place is like DEEP in the corner. Like you're looking at all these shops that don't relate to food, then BAM sushi right there.   Anyways we get seated and I didn't think I was going to drink cause I drank a lot the day before but got damn 2 for 1?! 2 for damn 1 my g. You already know I got 2 yogurt sojus, poured one for me and poured one for the homies.   Before I got pretty tipsy I had the sushi and it was so damn good. The slices are thick and big and they taste fresh. I mean I'm close to the water so for a desert wasteland of Nevada to get some good sushi is rare. Also their menu is expansive. Like a hundred or so things to order. High level these are what we got:  Different Nigiri: really good, fav was the garlic tuna. The lobster throws you off cause it's like imitation crab, but shit it's 20 dollars so whatcha expect.   Hand rolls: good, really filling.   Tempura shrimp: yaaaassssss it was cooked well and not over battered.   Rolls: good, just like any other sushi place presentation and sauces.   Desert: dat tempura ice cream, green tea ice cream is damn good. The tiramisu tasted like sugar and graham crackers tho.   Anyways I'm def coming back here every time I go to Vegas which is like every month.",

Ingrid was an amazing server, extremely responsive and attentive. Highly recommend the yellowtail hamachi as well as the yellowtail sushi. Both were fresh and intensely rich. My only regret is not finding out about this place earlier! If you're visiting Vegas, this place definitely edges out most of the buffets on the strip in terms of quality, options, and value.",

It's also very convenient for my friends and I because it's like 7 mins from UNLV! The rolls are also amazing. Their baked roll \"wet dream\" was so good! But my favorite baked roll is PLAYBOY (trust me it's AMAZING) it comes in 4 pieces. It's really convenient they do half rolls so you can pick and taste without wasting!  Their fried rolls come in 2-5 pieces also which is so convenient because fried rolls are very heavy in the stomach. The place itself has a very nice, home-y feel to it and the surroundings just feel so positive and easy going! I really loved this place, will be coming back soon! :) it's my favorite sushi place no matter where I go I keep coming back!!!!",

After waiting outside in the dreadful heat, we were told that we would be seated at this specific table, so again, we stood in the front waiting. And mind you, the waiting area in the front isn't so big. 10 mins pass, and we see the couple who was sitting on the table they told us we'll be at leave. A few other people leave, so there's a bunch of tables open, and we're not seated. Minutes pass, and this other worker tells us that we're gonna be seated at ANOTHER table, but the people that were on that table, were getting ready to leave. Umm...it would've been nice if someone told us that like 10 mins ago. I didn't eat the whole day prior to that, and it was already 6pm so I was grouchy.   Finally, we were seated and got our drink orders in pretty quick. It was our (us, tourists lol) first time there, so our friend who is a local ordered for us. Our first round of sushi came by quickly. Everything we had was DEEELISH. I think it was the White Superman Nigiri (pls correct me if Im wrong) which was probably the best thing that we had. I seriously could've been happy if that was the only thing that I ate that night, but like a crapload more orders of it, haha. But I wanted to try everything else, which was good, but nothing compared to that.   I didn't get the name of our server, but he always checked on us to see if we wanted to order more things as well as refilling our water. Other than the whole seating mishap, everything else was awesome. For just about $26/person for AYCE sushi, this will most def be one thing on our bucket list to do for the next time we come to Vegas!",

I was impressed by the upscale chopsticks and ambiance. I was disappointed by my diet Coke coming in a can. I'd like to drink copious amounts of soda when eating lots of sushi.  I thought three sushi were the stars of the meal. First, I did rave about octopus sushi someplace else, but this was thin cut, tender and the super finely sliced lemon added a citrus explosion of taste. Secondly, the Sarada Lobster was great. The lobster meat had a smoky, savory taste that I hadn't experienced before. The TNT roll had real scallops on top. (If you know about seafood, you know the small scallops on bag are another fish.)  Other things that were positive: transluscent rice had a different texture that held sauce well, the fish was markedly fresh, there wasn't an overbundance of rice. The eel was very tender, and the service was prompt.   Some of the small lobster chunks on the sushi were a bit dry and there wasn't enough cream cheese on the Japanese Lasagna.  Try this place. It isn't a waste of your time or money!   Disclaimer: I photographed the food of mine and my companion. I really didn't eat all of that sushi.",

I was immediately disappointed when I realized it was all you can eat, because usually that isn't a sign of good quality.   However! These guys blew the All You Can Eat stereotypes out of the water. Everything I ordered was fresh, delicious, and well prepared. The rolls and sushi had some unique and tasty flavors I had never tried before, and I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life. I expected them to go heavy on the rice, and they didn't. I cannot come up with a single complaint about this place. The price was phenominal, the fish was fresh, the flavor combinations were on point. I wish I had a place like this nearby!",

Lets begin with location. Located right off the strip, its close towards the MGM and mandalay, yet avoids the busy n hectic traffic of most hotel buffets. Ample amounts of parking to help get you in the goodness more quickly!!! Lol  The restaurant itself is small and quaint, yet a home like environment feel to help you dig in to your sushi more comfortably.. The waitstaff are amazing!!! Very polite, and were always ready and willing to serve. The place was very clean very well upkept.  I called in advance to make sure we didnt need a reservation, and was seated very quickly upon arriving.. Got there around 8pm was ready to start ordering.   We ordered so many sushi plates that i think we tried just about everything!!! The lobster roll, soft shell crab, bacon wrapped kabobs, oysters(one per person, and very spicy!! But delicious!), and the bulgoki nachos were on the top of my list of recommendations. The rice/ fish ratio was awesome and you get so much bang for your buck..   Out of all of this, the icing on the cake is that they serve FILTERED water as your complimentary drink!!! Such a blessing being as us hawaiians have been pampered with great water on a daily basis.  All in all, there is nothing negative to say about sakana. They're easily my favorite AYCE sushi establishment in Las Vegas and would highly recommend anyone to try it for themselves",

If you're hungry, the AYCE option is the way to go, as everything on the menu is selectable. Try the items highlighted in red on the large, two sided menu. These (e.g. \"The Shit\", \"I Love My Ass\"), are customer favorites. Be sure to take advantage of the all day 2 for 1 beer & wine offer.  The service is great... taking orders, recommending items, clearing plates, and taking subsequent orders until you can't eat another bite. Orders come right away from the 4 sushi chefs. Baked items take a bit longer, so order plenty at first and time your 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ... orders.   Happy eating.",

    "text": "Definitely has the potential to be a great place but the service got to me.   We came on a slow Sunday and our server took forever to 1) bring us our menus 2) check in on us and when he did, he just brought us another sushi list for us to check off an then left us for another 20 minutes. i.e., we were seated for about 30-40 min before getting in an order.   For the most part the food was pretty on point for being so affordable.  Note** a lot of the special sushi is not avail during lunch, i.e., uni, amaebi, sashimi dishes.  But i think u can still get ur money's worth w nigiri.**   The GOOD:   As echoed before, fish to rice ratio on nigiri is awesome.  Great value for ayce.   Sushi: No complaints re: the fish.  Highlights were the yellowtail and yuzu yellowtail (the fact that you can get that on the ayce is amazing - so fresh and delicious) Salmon was good.  Tuna was a tad bland.   The 300 handroll: ABSOLUTELY recommend, full of tasty quality fish and not super filling (Do not recommend the burritos, too filling, average tasting.)  bulgogi nachos, and tempura was on point.    The Bad:  Calamari tempura -- was not real squid but chewy squid sticks... always a signal of a cheap place, I was actually surprised when the rest of the seafood was decent afterwards   the wasabi and ginger are in little condiment self-serve pots on each table---maybe it's the same quality as what u get at other restaurants, but how fresh can it be really?   Honey Toast - was disappointed--it was basically honey and cream on a toasted hawaiian roll, NOT brick toast!! given, it was ayce, but i hate feeling duped.   SERVICE: I ordered the white tuna fish during the first round, when i asked about it later, the server said, it's coming....Then 20 min later he said, it came out on the first plate of sushi....Then when i placed a second order, he realized after checking that they actually ran out of it, so I never got it that day.....  Nothing peeves me more than a server that tries to bs their way into answering your questions without checking first.   Also, A couple of my other sushi orders were simply ignored, and when I asked about them, the server kind of shrugged it off. This was the younger, non-asian server... don't care that he's not asian, but not sure if it was the age or maturity level that let him be so lacksadaisacal about our table.   We had another server, Sunny who later picked up our table who was GREAT. He was always coming around our table, making sure our water was filled, clearing our plates etc. However, the first server left a bad taste in my mouth.",

This was a hidden gem. Fast service, great variety and value. My girl and I did the AYCE, and it was definitely worth it. Will definitely visit again. Only downfall is the limited seating on a crowded weekend night, but otherwise a great experience.",

There were about 4 tables filled with guests on Friday at lunch time. Service were a little slow at begining, but very friendly server workng hard by herself.   There Nigiri cuts are a thin cut and longer compared to other Sushi places. The ratio to fish and rice is perfect, it was so long that you could completely wrap the tiny rice ball with fish, so your rice don't soak up the soysauce too much.  Uni and Amaebi were very fresh and melts in your mouth. I had a baked lobster roll and the amount th sauce on top was not overpowering the roll.   The sign stills says Kabuki, I am guessing they will put up their own sign pretty soon.  This place is so much better than the place acrossed the street and more fresh fish!",

    "text": "Super adorable saucers, shelf plushies, wall decor, and dividers. Colorful but not filled with too many loud colors. I like the cube seats because they're unique and not from the usual norm. This place is one of my fav ayce in vegas. I've been here like 5 times within 6 months. Always worth the long walk from UNLV. Nice price. Extremely kind employees (everyone as in everyone who comes out to the tables, not just waiters/waitresses). For a third of one of my visits, i think a chef was taking our order at our table. He was energetic. I like it! It was a bonus appetizer that pumped us up because we felt super welcome. One time a guy took my plate although there was still one nigiri left. He realized before walking more than 3 feet away and returned it immediately. The fish color blends in with the plate i had it on..so i dont blame him! It was a funny moment. Why would i be mad over something that was NOT pure ignorance or rudeness? But EH. some customers are just too bratty to appreciate the good points. -cough- my sister, dad, a few buds. -cough- There were two occasions i had the middle-aged waitress and she's awesome to have if you're not the type of customer who has a royalty mindset and gets offended over every little thing in the world. Dont get me wrong though, i'm not a pushover xD. My friend went cray cray with the second round of orders and the waitress asked us if we were sure we could finish. Turns out my friend couldnt finish (i warned my friend i couldnt help them) and we got very very lowkey gently lightly scolded by the waitress (sorry. Trying to be precise with what i mean). Thank you for taking care of us! We will be backkk",

Ambience: 3.5 Okay layout but bathrooms need remodeling.  Service: 4 Our waiter was excellent.  He was constantly checking on us.  Price: 5 You can't beat $20.95 for lunch that includes dessert.    Final note - I highly recommend this restaurant if you have a big appetite and want to keep your cost down.  Food quality is not Nobu in Caesar's but it won't cost you an arm and a leg.  Bill for 2 with sake was about $50.  Our bill at Nobu was close to $300 and I left hungry.",

With so many AYCE sushi spots in Vegas, we just had to take a chance because we didn't know which one to pick from all the great reviews.  Finally decided on Sakana and it was a chance worth taking.  Let me put it out there right now that I don't normally eat the raw stuff.  I tried it a few times but I'm not a fan so I'm speaking from the point of view of someone who only enjoys cooked rolls.  They have a variety of rolls and the boyfriend and I loved them.  They also have this appetizer called \"the shit\", which is really weird when you order it, but it lives up to its name.  SO GOOD -- just try it!  We put in for several orders of it.  The servers are also very friendly and attentive.  The only thing I didn't like about the place is that it was fairly warm that night and I don't know what was going on with their AC.  Other than that, we loved the place so much that before we headed back home to Cali, we hit up Sakana one last time!",

We've gone here so much that a couple of the waiters know our orders now (it's actually kind of embarrassing). Although the restaurant is cute and we go so often, I can admit that the experience can be either great or not so great. There have been times when we've been forgotten, when we've been charged things we did not receive, or just had the type of cold-shoulder service you sometimes see from waiters who genuinely couldn't give a damn about you. I actually prefer the food and service during the PM (like 8 o'clock and later). Overall, not a place I would hype too much but it's something that is good to just get a little sushi fix.",

Try this spot out soon.... because these AYCE sushi places tend to go DOWNHILL QUICK!! This spot hasn't opened for a long time yet, so its still good.   Get in while the getting is good!!",
