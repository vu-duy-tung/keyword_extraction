We walk in (mind you, this is AFTER all the storms have passed through- sky is clear, in fact), there are people who just received their food, and there is another couple that were almost done.. Total of 4 people eating inside. We walk in, and are INSTANTLY (and rudely) told \"were closed due to the storm\" um... WHAT?? What storm. I laugh and say \"you're kidding right? The storm is over\" and once again, the cashier says \"we're closed Due. To. The. Storm. Warning\". So we left. We probably will never go back to this Rachel's Kitchen, or any others. And I will not be recommending this place. It's a shame what customer service has come to. This place ant too special, and I can go down the street, and get the same thing, for less, with better service.",

I decided to get a chicken Caesar salad &' let me tell you.... It was DELICIOUS!!! The best chicken I have ever had in a salad. They cook it fresh &' then they slice it &' put it on top of the salad. The smoothies that they have are delicious as well. You can actually taste all the fruits in them. This place is definitely a great place to eat at because it's heathy &' the environment is wonderful. The staff is so friendly &' always making sure you're doing okay. Vanessa and Yesenia were wonderful. Vanessa helped me specialize my smoothie and Yesenia was very patient when I kept asking her what I should try &' what's good. They both are always so friendly &' always ask how my days been going. The customer service is beyond amazing. Love it here &' will always come back!!!",

I usually eat here a couple times a month and the staff have always been super friendly. My main issue is their inconsistency in portion sizes. I usually order the Mac n' cheese and about every other time I order it I receive what I would consider a \"side order\" type portion. I can eat it in like five bites and its mostly all cheese sauce with hardly any noodles. On the other hand, sometimes I order it and I have enough for two meals. If their food wasn't so pricey I wouldn't be writing a review about it.. But when your Mac n cheese is close to $11, I expect to be full and to receive an actual dinner/lunch size portion of food. I'm not sure I'll continue to eat here because it is so aggravating to get home and realize you've spent $11 for a tin full of cheese sauce.",

Nice to have real plates and utensils to eat with, not paper or plastic. The atmosphere was pretty cold, no personality there, but the person behind the counter was polite, helpful, and very patient with another customer who took a long time to decide and order. I'll return as it was a nice place overall.",

That plus a side of turkey bacon and a small fountain drink cost me $13 plus tip. The granola came with vanilla yogurt on top, which the menu did not describe. I was initially upset because I didn't want a parfait, but ultimately I was glad because the granola was so blah. There were a few raisins but other than that it was mostly just toasted oats... Nothing crunchy or even holding it together. My friend ordered Banana chocolate chip pancakes. It was a large serving but she ate less than half because  the bottom two pancakes were overcooked and a bit burned. It was clean and the staff was friendly although a bit slow. We were the only two people there and ordered at the same time,  but her pancakes came out about 15 minutes before my granola. The best thing was that they had unsweetened iced green tea.",

We were met with smiles and welcomes by their courteous staff. Our breakfast choices were plentiful and very tasty. The food was delivered to our table in a very timely manner.  Prices seemed quite reasonable. I'm a big iced tea fan and they had green tea and tropical passion iced tea to chose from. The decor was comfortable, refreshing and inviting. I personally LOVED the background music playing as it reminded me of my younger years! When I asked my friends how many stars they would rate on their first visit to Rachel's Kitchen on a scale of 1 to 4, they all said 4 stars. Enough said.",

I had never heard of Rachel's Kitchen before so I decided to drive up to it and when my boyfriend and I saw that they serve smoothies I went in because that was just what my boyfriend wanted.  The place reminded me of a Panera where you order your food up front then take a number and someone brings you your food or you take it there yourself.  Nessa was very helpful to me figuring out the menu of what was offered.  She helped me customize a banana-blueberry smoothie for my boyfriend who waited in the car, as well as a 440 sandwich and watermelon juice for myself.  The 440 sandwich came with a choice of some sides and I got onion rings.  The 440 sandwich was chicken, goat cheese and avocado on a bread of your choice.  I chose ciabiatta.  The sandwich itself was decent and the onion rings were okay.  The watermelon juice was fresh from a juicer and Nessa made it herself in front of me.  For the price of the food it's pretty good, and Nessa's service made it a nice experience.  I'm sure I will come back here for a juice fix when I don't feel like making it myself.",

    "text": "When this location first opened I came here almost everyday for lunch. It was convenient and I liked the turkey sandwich I ordered. The price was a little high but still within a reasonable range. It normally cost me $11.65, approx., to get my sandwich. Later they implemented a military discount which brought the total to $10.65. Today I came in to order the same thing I've ordered since it opened almost a year ago and it the total was around $13.50. Seriously? First they don't honor the military discount because you have to be in uniform. First off, that's a pretty good way of never having to give a discount. Military families use the same source of income, at least i do. So if you give a spouse $1 off you're still giving that same military personnel a $1 off. What's the difference? It just seems very unfair to me. I wouldn't of been upset if it was just that. But now the prices have raised which I understand that's how businesses work. But $13 for a sandwich that's just turkey,  bacon, lettuce, and mustard?? Needless to say I will not be coming back. The people here are not as friendly as the previous staff.  Before when I came in they would offer me a cup for water and I always declined but today I was thirsty so I asked for a cup for water and when I got my receipt it had a charge for the cup. Really??? You're charging me more,  taking away a discount because my husband didn't come with me in uniform and now something I used to get for free is now $$.",

My order was also ready right when I got there and that made for efficiency while being in a hurry.  I ordered the chicken and roasted vegetable salad and the portion I received was incredibly generous. It was full of roasted zucchini, squash, eggplant, fresh tomato, cucumber and marinated grilled chicken. I didn't even have to ask for the dressing on the side because it was already there and it was a nice portion of the vinaigrette, not one of those baby cups you sometimes receive and have to ask extra for.   I like this place because the food is always fresh and the portions are always generous. My personal favorites are the Cobb salad, the 440 sandwich, any of their delicious soups and the lemon bars. Their breakfast menu is also full of good eats.  Ordering for pick up or dine in this place is my go to for fresh food in my neighborhood.",

It boasts fresh, health-minded breakfast and lunch foods along with juices, smoothies, and a small selection of beer, wine, and champagne. There were several options for more health-conscious substitions such as turkey bacon, egg whites, and lettuce wraps.   Walking in, the atmosphere is a simple cafe with room for about 50 people at full capacity. The one thing that grated (no pun intended) was the constant loud juicing going on behind the counter.   I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap, and despite ordering just after my friend who was with me, the food took significantly longer to come out. It was worth the wait however, and the wrap was well filled with chicken and not overly drenched in BBQ sauce. Veggies were fresh and crunchy.   Tl;dr? Tasty health-concious food, a bit of a wait and occasionally loud atmosphere.",

    "text": "My third visit here. It's expensive and the food is subpar to par! First two to-go orders tasted alright - breakfast burrito (sub par) on the first visit and then the breakfast wrap (par) on the second visit. This morning, I invited my daughter for brunch. As we were already enjoying our food (she ordered the chicken caesar salad, which she would've liked a lot if only they didn't put too much cheese in the salad), I found a short strand of hair in my food (I ordered The Favorite)! I'm not a stickler when it comes to stuff like that (I choose my battles in life!). I took it out and kept going and didn't even say anything to my daughter; and then my daughter's eyes got bigger, made a big \"woah\" and goes, \"Mom!!!! Look!!!!\" So, there she pulls out a short strand of hair out of her salad! Oh heck, I thought! Two strikes! I called one of the servers and told him what we just found. He asked my daughter if she wanted new salad, but by then, she already lost her appetite. The server just said sorry, and walked away. My daughter and I thought he could've just offered to credit our food or he could've given us a voucher.... something... We had to be home at a certain time, that we couldn't really stay at the place another minute, so we decided to just pack up. Needless to say, I felt JIPPED paying almost $35.00 for two meals and finding hair strands in both orders! Oh, and one more thing, the coffee beans in the coffee were not fully grounded! There were particles of ground coffee beans in my cup. Side note: when you order and pay upfront, you're automatically asked (by their computer cash register) to tip...",

I will say $6 for a smoothie is kind of pricey. But it tastes fresh and I would absolutely pay for another one soon! I would love to try their breakfast items.",

As we were deciding on what to order, two more groups of people walked in. (They weren't greeted as well). Everyone was undecided. Finally we were ready and I let the cashier Yesenia know. She ignored me. Then I spoke a little louder thinking maybe she didn't hear me. We ordered a mushroom burger and fettuccine alfredo with chicken, and two watermelon juices. The cashier Yesenia looked back at the juicer and then said, \"the juicer isn't working right now.\" When I can clearly see it was taken apart to be cleaned and she didn't want to clean it or juice our drinks. Which was pretty upsetting. So we went with just food. The other two groups then ordered and another person walked in and ordered. Now am I not only upset about not being able to have a fresh juice because of pure laziness, we received our food last when we ordered first. The food was good but I'm not happy with this experience and I will not be returning.",

I work right next door and didn't feel like driving to find lunch, so I decided to walk over and see what all the fuss was about (from coworkers.) The lineup to order was alittle weird at first because people were on both sides (lining up across the dessert glass and in front where you had just walked in) so after stumbling abit and making sure I wasn't cutting in front, I finally found my place and ordered. I was originally going to get the Angel Hair Bolognese but I wasn't quite sure what exactly the sauce was and even if I would like it (the cashier tried to explain it the best he could, but sweet dumb me still didn't get it), so I ordered their Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. Now, I either missed it completely or it didn't mention it, but there IS mushroom in this dish and I didn't figure that out until I got it. I wasn't going to ask them to remake it or anything since it was my error, so I just ate around it. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC as far as taste goes. The restaurant was clean and gave it a really nice, home feeling to it. Akin to going to a family member's house to eat. I also would highly suggest grabbing one of their Lemon Bars. I tried one for the first time and absolutely fell for it, it was heavenly. Waitstaff was very nice (I wish I had names, I would praise them so highly.) If you're ever around and looking for a place for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend them.",

That needs to stop. Raisin do not help the runny Acai.   Staff was nice and prompt. Only real complaint, the music. Was hip hop club. At 8am it's too much. How about some light music or even holiday music.  Will order to go probably next time if this crap is playing.",

    "text": "Gave this place a second try for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised!   I have always enjoyed the lunch options, but the last one I had breakfast here it was an awful experience for a high price.   Still a high price as we paid $37 (with tip) for an omelet, a 2 egg breakfast, and French toast. Omelet and 2 egg breakfast were delicious! French toast was a little different. Not the best that I've had, and felt like I was eating French bread with maple syrup. Lack of fruit came with the French toast as well. Overall giving their restaurant 4 stars for the hit or miss with the food. Some of their items are excellent while others are mediocre. Great place for healthier options but also give the option for not-so-healthy options, which works great for my boyfriend & I.   Will continue to come here for now breakfast and lunch and try more items on the menu.",

    "text": "Absolute love Rachel's Kitchen! I also love that it is 3 minutes away from the hubby's work, which makes it easy thinking of where to go for a mid-day date...aka lunch break.   However, I can only base my review on the items we order/have ordered. A Caesar salad is not the healthiest of choice when it comes to salads...but by gosh there are leaves in it for crying out loud--healthy enough! I am an absolute Caesar salad finatic and a huge critic. When ever we frequent Rachel's I opt for the Caesar chicken wrap. Honestly, one of the best Caesar wraps I've had, thus far. Gosh knows how much Caesar wraps I've explored.   I love that it isn't dripping in sauce and that all the ingredients taste fresh and crispy. My husband thinks their chicken is a tad dry, but I absolutely love it. I don't think it's as dry as he thinks. The chicken used are hormone free, free ranged chicken...even better! There are different wraps to choose from (wheat, flour, spinach...), but if you don't special request your wrap of choice don't expect them to ask unless it is an actual option for that item.   Their wraps come with a choice of French fries, sweet potatoe fries, onion rings, or kettle chips. I'm about the ying and the  yang...I'm already eating something healthy, drop me some french fries. Their fries are portioned small, not greasy, and more on the skinny side. I like 'em anyway.   We've also had their bbq chicken wrap which is definitely good as well! Same thing, not soggy, fresh vegetables, no overwhelming amount of sauce in the wrap and pretty tasty.   You can actually turn their salads/sandwiches into a wrap as well. My husband did this for their Rachel's chicken salad. It was deeeelish!!! It's a chicken salad but with grapes and apples diced in there! Definitely recommend you trying that as well.  I only have tried their smoothies once. Twas the sunrise. It was a little on the disappointing side because it was a little watery. Not even smoothie like at all. One day I may try a smoothie out again, but I only go for their wraps so then again...maybe not. That'll be a mood.   I personally don't like bringing the whole family here because it's basically like 10/11 bucks per person. My boys end up hungry an hour later. They're typical filipinos who need their rice + ______ to feel satisfied. The husband and I...we're usually good. I mean, you are eating here with a purpose so you should know going in that you will probably be hungry an hour later. Hahahhaa.   I would certainly recommend trying the place out especially if you are health conscious or on the road to weight watching. I love that when you dine-in they don't serve your food on paper plates (I don't have anything against paper plates whatsoever). Seeing your huge serving of salad in a real bowl just looks classier. They do offer vegeterian options and you can certainly request changes to your meal to make it vegan friendly if applicable. We don't have much places, if any, in the northwest side of such type of business to size them up to another location. Fortunately for them.  Note: it's best to try them dining-in first. If you order out and have a ways drive, your fries will sog and your wrap will start diluting the sauce...you may not get a good first impression that way. Unless, you plan on eating it to-go  in the next 5-10 minutes after buying it.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",

While we were ordering a woman behind asked a young lady behind the counter a question about a salad, when she responded she wasn't sure the lady behind us had a rude comment, the cashier waiting on us immediately defended his coworker very kindly by pointing out that she had just started working there today and he would be glad to answer her questions when he was done waiting on us.  I ordered a burger I normally cut my burgers up because I am weird like that, I found my burger was under cooked. Before I could even get out of my seat someone was right by my side asking if my burger was ok. When I explained it was undercooked she took it right back and had one remade for me. I am beyond impressed with the service and the the food! The sweet potato fries were some of the best I have ever had and the burger was delicious!",

Turkey Club or Cobb Salad, Garden Pasta and Soup.  This time we ordered Turkey Club and Garden Pasta and Broccoli cream soup. Turkey Club was same but this time i ordered sweet potato fries instead of Onion rings because they only give you 3 onion rings.  Garden Pasta was disappointing because not only pasta was breaking like it's been sitting in the water too long and pasta was watery and half of the portion compared to previous togo orders.   It makes me angry when food i order lacks consistency in taste and portion.    Your Establishment isn't cheap but when you mess up take out orders it really makes people feel cheated and never want to go back.  We are no long ordering food from here because we feel that last meal was complete act of thievery or con or whatever.   When you pick up your order ask them to show you the food instead of just packing it away so you can prevent this.... which you shouldn't have to... arrggg  I usually understand error or mistake such as wrong item and missed item and such because it could happen.  BUT when I can't get the consistent quality on food I do not go back because I do not want to gamble with food.",

He was upset that baby stacks was too long of a wait for me since I had to go to work. So he wasn't looking forward to eating here. Surprisingly,  he loves the pancakes and kept mentioning then all day. Lol I had the favorite which now is my favorite! I forgot what was in it but it is what I would want in my omelets. Mushrooms, avocado, goat cheese.  I wish I tried the sweet potato pancake. It sounds amazing. I definitely want to come back and try everything else they have.",

However last night I received some of the worst service I have ever experienced. When we walked in there were only a couple of tables with people, they were NOT busy. We waited at the front and checked out the menu for the first 5-10 minutes, I could see the 2 people working the front preparing food so I figured they needed some more time. After standing at the counter for another 5 mins I heard 1 of the employees say to the other \"Do you want to take her order\" he responded with a \"No\" and they just continued ignoring me, pretending to prepare food on the back counter. After another 5-10 mins of standing at the front, (holding a heavy 2 year old I might add) I was still being ignored. It was at that point that I finally flagged the girl down and asked if they were accepting any new orders (It was 6:00pm on a Thursday) She said yes in a few minutes because they were too busy and just kept ignoring me. I went to sit my kid down at the table and wait for her to finish when a group of people walked in towards the front, they were immediately helped. . . so I walked out and i will never return to my neighborhood Rachel's again. This location has poor management and I hope their employees understand that they are working in the \"Service Industry\".",

Especially considering the ingredients aren't listed on the menu board but rather on the menu at the cashier station. Not convenient. Also, it's 85 degrees and they kept propping the door. It was so warm. Finally, my daughter (5 y/o) was very vocal about how strange it was that the restroom was only for one person so that's probably good info to know!

    "text": "It's really unfortunate that the food at Rachel's Kitchen is so good because lately their service has been downright terrible. I go to Rachel's Kitchen once a week for lunch. Up until today my biggest issue has been the cooks. Without fail, every time an attractive woman walks in, they call each over to the window to check her out and make comments to each other. I get that people might think that's a silly issue, but it's totally unprofessional. This is a restaurant, not a club, boys. Then today, it was pretty busy, but I ordered my salad to go and took a seat to wait. After about 25 minutes I went up to inquire about how much longer it might be. They had set my salad off to the side. The cashier just smiled and said, \"Oh, here it is. They must not have called your name.\" And by \"they\", I'm pretty sure she meant herself. No apology, no offering to refund my money, nothing. Just placing the blame on some mysterious person.   So, there you have it. Great food, crappy service. I guess if you have all day to wait or want to feel good about the way you look by having the people making your food check you out, Rachel's Kitchen is for you!",

Well just happened that one of the physicians I work for decided to extend his hours on Christmas Eve and boy, us staff were not happy. He must of felt the daggers in his back when he'd walk past because he decided to buy us lunch to compensate. So, we placed an order for about 15 people and Rachel's Kitchen did such a good job.  We ordered for lunch but I was happy to be able to also order breakfast items as well (ha ha McDonalds). I ordered a Proteins Lover's Scramble. Most of my co-workers ordered lunches consisting of wraps, burgers and salads and some smoothies. Mind you by the time I got my food, I expected it to be lukewarm or cold but my eggs were hot and tasty in a heat insulating container. My meal came with home fries too. I'm not normally into potatoes (hash browns, etc.) but they were so good I decided to write a review! The eggs were real eggs, not restaurant egg product. I consider myself a food nazi which is why I choose to bring my lunch to work everyday but Rachel's food seems like quality worth paying for. I now know where I will be eating when I'm not prepared with my own lunch.",

For one thing we ordered pancakes with eggs easy over. They said they cannot make easy over they would only make over medium. I agreed, but when they came they were easy over. They will serve you fruit with your pancakes. But I'm just not used to having my watermelon & cantaloupe dipped in syrup before I eat them. The prices were about average and the food was also just about average. I really did not see anything that would set this restaurant a part from the pack. It is a casual setting it is not a restaurant setting where you are catered to. It is somewhere between fast food and a restaurant in their atmosphere. But on the positive side they are very friendly and they have outdoor seating. I would guess that by heeding the reviews posted they will be a 4 star kitchen in no time.",

The Menu is exactly the same as all of the other locations, and last time I tried their BBQ Chicken Wrap and Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie. This time, I went with their Sauteed Mushroom Cheeseburger and an Incredible Hulk Smoothie. I don't know about you, but I like my meats pink and perfectly medium rare. Unfortunately, all burgers here are cooked Medium to Cardboard...You have been warned  The burger was okay, but Wifey's 440 Sandwich was very tasty. I will be back, not for a burger, but for other menu items. Welcome to the neighborhood Rachel's Kitchen!   ALOHA!!!",

The other guy working there did offer to get more from the back for other customers. Food came out rather quickly after ordering, the place itself seemed clean.  Food: my daughter ordered Mac and cheese, it was not the traditional Kraft crap that other restaurants order, but it was not something I personally thought tasted very good. I had to a salt and pepper to make it taste decent (personal opinion). My daughter did eat it... My club sandwich was pretty good, I liked the avocado on it because if was freshly sliced.

I like the unlimited fountain drink refills and that they offer vitamin water, not just sodas.   First time I went, I had a smoothie only and it was pretty good. This time I thought I'd try a salad since I was there for a lunch meeting. But I was disappointed.   If I were reviewing just the food, we'd be looking at 2 stars. I added the third because of the good points I mentioned above.  I ordered the Grilled Vegetable and chicken salad. The menu described my salad deliciously, but what came out really seemed like leftovers thrown together haphazardly with cross contamination from another salad I'm sure they mixed in the same bowl earlier. The menu on their website listed all of the ingredients, but I found items that weren't included in the menu description. Either the menu is incorrect, or the salad was mixed in the same bowl, or someone in the back made a mistake.   The other issue I had was that the salad wasn't actually mixed well. I had been eating it for about 10 minutes before I found the zucchini and eggplant at the very bottom. By then I didn't want to eat it, because they didn't look appetizing.  The grilled vegetables were cold and limp, hence my suspicion that it was leftovers. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked and chilled the day before, as did the grilled veggies. The whole salad was bland, and there was barely any salad dressing at all. And again, the occasional stray item that wasn't supposed to be in the salad popped up every once in awhile.  I left most of the salad on the table when I left. I barely ate any of it. Shame, because it was a very large portion. But it just wasn't worth it. I came home and I'm making my own lunch.  Bottom line: I felt like I was eating a salad at a fast food establishment, not a mom and pop small, locally owned business.",

Another disturbing thing is that although it touts itself as a \"health conscious\" restaurant, only about 15 items on the menu have nutrition information.  This makes me wonder about the other food items and how healthy they may or may not be.",

I ordered their grilled cheese and asked if they could add chicken to it, the girl taking my order said yes, and so I ponied up the $25 for two sandwiches with side salads, and sat down to wait.  We were the only ones in the place except for another couple who already had their food when we arrived.  I heard the cook ask the cashier about my chicken being added to the grilled cheese and she told him, yes that is what I ordered.  It took 20 minutes to get our sandwiches, while we were waiting we smelled burning bread and I assumed that, that had caused the wait.  We just got home and guess what's missing! No chicken! Not to mention that only one side of my sandwich was grilled! They must have burnt one side and just replaced it with a piece of un-grilled bread to save time...I understand we went in a little before closing, but for the price of the food, the amount of people there, AND the cook verifying my order you would think they would do better.",

Needed something light so a wrap was our choice.  We did a Yelp ck in and got a free glass of wine, that is amazing!   The only draw back is the order took a while to come out but it tasted good so I still gave them 5 stars.  Places like this are better than fast food!",

    "text": "Visited this location a couple Saturdays nights ago. The restaurant is a semi fast food, some healthy and some not so healthy, modern dining establishment.  They offer a variety of breakfast, lunch and smoothie options even though we were there for dinner.  First off the place is super clean and refreshing with the splash of their greenish colors and green and white mosaic tables. Love the decor. You basically order at the counter and they will bring your food to you. Upon arriving we were immediately greeted with smiles.  The girl at the front was very helpful as we were undecided on what we wanted and we had a few questions. She was super knowledgable and even helped us with some suggestions. My husband ordered a watermelon juice that was absolutely delicious and refreshing especially for summertime!  We ordered a bbq chicken wrap to share and it came with fries.  I must say that this wrap has been on my mind ever since.  I'm very picky about bbq sauce but it was the perfect kind of sweet & tangy but my favorite was the onion crunchies in the wrap. I wish I can duplicate it at home but like they say a sandwich is always better when someone else makes it for you. lol  I couldn't really decide on a smoothie however the girl at the counter gave me a couple options for the flavors that I like.  She made me what was her favorite and it was perfect!   I was full halfway through my smoothie and threw the rest in my freezer when I got home to enjoy the next day.  You definitely don't get service like that at any smoothie places I have been to...but like I said this place is so much more than just a smoothie place...its your local hint of refreshing food and drink with exceptional service.  I highly recommend it.",

However, I never realized I had a message and missed it. I still think that was very kind of them.   Great food, but the customer service lacks. Always preorder, walk in after time given and can see our food ready and still always wait at least 15/20 minutes while they do other things that don't need to be done at that moment. By the time we get home our food is always super cold and condensation soaked. Same issue no matter when I go in or how not busy they are. I never mind waiting, but they need to learn how to prioritize and work together. That said, I go back because I LOVE the chopped broccoli salad.",

But we're talking about healthy eating and I'd recommend this place if you like to watch what you eat.   However, I don't watch what I eat and I'd have to say this is pricey.  My last visit I ordered the Garden Burger with sweet potato fries and a regular smoothie.  As far as what I'd recommend, I can't really say.  Look at the ingredients and see what's in your diet and what's not.  Staff knows a lot about their items so you can ask them too.  They've screwed up my to go order a couple times but fixed it when I drove back to let them know.  And another time they forgot to put the protein in my smoothie.

Total for those four items came to $34. I then left a $6 tip. After I paid, the girl at the register was very rude. She made the smoothies and nodded at me rather than carrying them to my table where I sat waiting for the remaining items. For $6 dollars, I served myself.... When I finally got the food, there were only 4, seriously FOUR onion rings with the wrap and handful of fries. I'm talking about less fries than a small fry at McDonalds.... Please see attached photos. Terrible value for the price paid. I won't be back... Ever....",

    "text": "I've walked/ driven past Rachel's Kitchen at The District or their Summerlin locations.  Their menu seems like I couldn't get a triple bypass after eating here so I never bothered giving them a try.   After a hearty brunch at a cafe nearby, I was craving for a smoothie real bad so we went here. I normally get anything with strawberries but I wanted something with Nutella...or chocolate. They don't have anything with Nutella so, I got Peanut Butter Blast (chocolate peanut butter cups, bananas, peanut butter, chocolate milk and non-fat vanilla frozen yogurt).  I'm not a fan of chocolate peanut butter cups but if it's in smoothie form then, it's not too bad. It wasn't as thick as a smoothie should be but the taste was great. The friend got an oatmeal raisin cookie and a Sunrise smoothie (strawberries, bananas, OJ, apple juice and non-fat vanilla frozen yogurt).  The consistency was perfect and you can tell real fruits were used.  We waited about 10 minutes for our smoothies.  You can add protein powder to your smoothie for $1. The cookie was crisp and not a lot of butter was used.  That's a good thing, right?  They have lots of healthy options such as salads, turkey burger, sandwiches, wraps, soups and fresh fruit juices.  I'll definitely be back to try their wraps or sandwiches.",

I always end up eating half here and taking the other half home. I've been here multiple times and always been served with reasonable timing. The last time I was here I ordered the protein scramble and loved it. This time, I ordered a 440 sandwich and I have never had goat cheese before. Didn't really love the cheese but everything else about the sandwich was great. I also love that they serve mimosas, wine and beer. They are very generous with the champagne they pour into their mimosas. The environment is nice, always clean and the outside seating is great as well. Definitely one of my favorite places to go to for brunch.",

I really tried to be good, but then my dinner buddy got the chicken fingers.  Of the kids menu.  Two huge whole pieces of chicken, looked like it was breaded and cooked in house, and tasted even better.  (Check out photo.)  Previously, I did have a favorite spot in town for chicken tenders, but now that I saw Rachel's, I have a new fave.  There is another location in Summerlin.  I don't know if they are the same owner.  This one serves beer.  Just a little drafty now that it's winter, so sit along the wall left of the door.",

    "text": "My first time to Rachel's kitchen...lots of my Yelp neighbors were makin a big deal out of it, so I figured I would give them a go when the time was right!  The items I've tried so far :  440 Sandwich ($10.50): Grilled Chicken Breast, Goat Cheese, Avocado, Roasted Red Peppers and Tomatoes, and Romaine Lettuce. Good, healthy sandwich lol. It felt a little spendy, but you are paying for fresh ingredients in a health conscious restaurant...so it kind of comes with the territory.   Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie : Pineapples, Banana, Coconut, Pineapple Juice, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt. This was probably my favorite shake out of the 3 I've tried so far!  Sunrise Smoothie : Strawberries, Bananas, Fresh Squeezed OJ, Apple Juice, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt. 2nd favorite...yum :P  Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie : Bananas, Peanut Butter, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups, Chocolate Milk, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt.  I think they compensate for the peanut butter, since that shake was a little more \"runny\" vs the others.  Oatmeal Raisin Cookie and Chocolate Chip Cookie ($1.50ea). Good cookies...they probably go light on the butter and sugar here. Juuust sweet enough, but it's definitely a \"healthy\" cookie.  Overall it is a pretty good deli style setup for quick eats that won't make you feel guilty eating it afterwards :)  Check out the pics :",

Nice to have the option to go somewhere and eat clean if I want to....or not and get some fries with it.   The BF and I decided to share:   Curried chicken salad sandwich - this had nice flavor and enjoyed the pear (? or green apple) and raisins in the mix. We chose French bread, but it came on a ciabatta shape instead, that's OK though. We picked sweet potato fries as our side and that was standard, but solid fare.   Angel Hair Bolognese - anytime I see bolognese I do want to try it. This was more in the \"meat sauce\" catagory than bolognese with carrots, celery, peas, etc. in it that other spots do. It was a rather large bowl and came piping hot! Decent homestyle sauce though.   It's counter order, get a number and DIY drinks so there isn't \"service\" to rate, but they we're friendly at the counter. I've seen in other locations reviews that it was \"pricey\", so I was actually surprised it was prices I was fine with. $9.95 for a sandwich and side didn't seem outrageous to me when a shitty chain diner like Denny's is charging about that.   I'm sure we will be back. I hear so much about their juice and smoothies that I definitely have to pop in for one soon as well as more of the menu. Good addition to the area, we don't really have a little cafe up here.",

I just can't believe that I never left a reviewed about them. Only thing I would like to see if they would change the menu or do sandwich of the month to keep me going there.  I mainly go for a nice smoothie. But wish u would crave their food.  Hope this review helps your Business.",

The veggie burger is wonderful, the 440 sandwich and tomato basil soup is pretty good, and the grilled cheese and chicken tortilla soup is bomb. The fresh fruit side was not great--not ripe at all. French fries are okay, but a little underseasoned. The atmosphere is fun, and service is always great.Overall, I'd say that this is a wonderful healthy option for eating out. There are several vegetarian and vegan options as well as a plethera of yummy smoothies to choose from. It is perfect for lunch dates and families.",

First of all, we placed a lot of catering order during my bachelorette weekend and this was the only restaurant that actually delivered to the hotel room.   We got the breakfast wrap platter for 12-16 people and it was perfect! I highly recommend this company if you're looking for breakfast to be delivered before a day of partying. It's a lot cheaper than any other breakfast restaurants in Vegas and plus it comes to your room so it's super convenient. Also, they include a lot of cream and sugar with your coffee so you don't have to worry about them forgetting it.  The guy that delivered the food was super friendly too!",

So much more friendlier than Summerlin and this location offers daily specials. Hubby and I are in here at least twice a week for lunch and I'm here five times a week for the iced tea instead of going to Starbucks. It's the best! Shout out to Juliana who always greets us with a smile as well as the manger (dark hair, beard about 30 years old). This establishment is always clean and very well run.  My favorite are the Cobb salad and bbq bacon burger. Our 12 year old loves to go here for breakfast and our daughter is all about the smoothies when she is home from college.

I tend to always get the 440 which is grilled chicken, bell pepper, and goat cheese on your choice of bread. Amazingly delicious considering the simple ingredients. No muss or fuss. Just quality simple ingredients. They offer a choice of sides and I get fries about half the time although the serving for them is quite small. The reason I get them is because they are good but I have to be very portion controlled so thos is actually a GREAT thing for me as I get fries in a small portion and won't go nuts, lol. However, that can definitely be a negative for people looking for a normal/big side of fries. For me it works though, lol.  Surprisingly, this place has one of the best pastas! All of them are amazing and taste like they came out of an old fashioned Italian restaurant! How?! Lol!  Everything is amazing. Smoothies, natural juices, pancakes, just everything. Again, it is a little pricey but you pay for quality. I try not to get it too often to be good with money but they make it hard, lol.",

    "text": "This is an update to the 1 star review I wrote in July of 2018.  After my review, I received an email and later, a handwritten card with a giftcard from the manager.  He addressed all my concerns in the email.  Since the original visit was when my mother was in town visiting, we saved the giftcard until she returned this summer.    Like I said in my previous review, the food was fine.  I didn't find it anything special.  My mom's fruit (melon variety) wasn't ripe, but frankly, that's hit or miss with most restaurants when you get sides of mixed fruit.  My kids aren't that picky.  My breakfast burrito was fine.  My husband was happy with his burger and chips.  On this visit, they seemed more knowledgeable about the peanut allergy, so that's great.  Although the manager had already reassured me we would be fine.  As we were waiting for our food, my mother was reading over the receipt.  Her burrito came with breakfast potatoes OR fruit.  She wanted both so they said they'd charge her for a side of fruit.  Okay, that's fine.  But as she looked at the receipt, her burrito said NO SIDE and an order of fruit for the additional charge.  We debated on whether the kitchen knew there was a potato side, or he legitimately put down \"no potato side\" AND charged for the fruit.  My mother made my husband go check while they were cooking so it would come out correctly.  It turns out that they did, in fact, have the potato order.  It's just written out as \"no side\".  Strange.  The kicker?  Because I was getting breakfast which is served all day, I wanted coffee.  They told me that they were out of coffee.  That's it.  He didn't offer to make it.  This is what irritated me during our first visit.  If you serve breakfast, you serve coffee.  It was about 6 in the evening. I requested he make some.  He was a bit thrown by the question, and didn't look like he wanted to make it, but then he obliged.  He wasn't rude, but I was clearly a pestering customer.  They did brew a pot of coffee and put it out, but they didn't put out any creamer so my husband had to go back to the counter to request creamer.  There were small scraps of food on the floor, some on the tables, and even the walls needed a good wipe down (small splashes of food).    Overall, this place isn't bad.  But it requires way too much effort, in my opinion, to eat here.  If I'm not getting full service, then I just want to place my order quickly and sit down to relax.  I don't want to ask a place to make something that's on their menu and is found in all restaurants.  When we left, as well as with some other customers, they thanked us for coming.    For quick meal restaurants, I much prefer Skinny Fats or Flower Child.  I order quickly and I sit down after serving myself a drink.  I don't need to have conversations with the staff or ask for special treatment.  I am updating my 1 star review to 3 stars because the manager of this local chain is concerned about his restaurants and the food tastes fine.  They lose 2 stars on the cleanliness and the lack of coffee on both visits.",

So for that, I cannot speak to the breakfast or other hot items. I've had the Turkey Club on wheat and the Chicken Tender Wrap. Both pretty good and fresh. The Cobb Salad is quite good. The Chinese Chicken salad is pretty good as well if you like the sweetness of the mandarins. Most recently (read: today. Lol) I had the 440 Sandwich on Ciabatta.  Tasty and a good blend of flavors. The Christmas Sugar Cookies were  yum. Crunchy though, not soft (if that matters to anyone). The rest of the menu looks good enough to warrant a trip in to check it out  :)",

The soup of the day, Cream of Mushroom Soup with carrot shavings, of course mushrooms, and a slight spicy kick in the creamy broth, was very good.  An Albacore Tuna Sandwich, with lettuce, tomato slices, and carrot bits on Sourdough Bread was packed with tuna nicely mixed with a light but very moist dressing.  Supple French Fries accompanying this sandwich were also quite tasty.  Diane said she was very pleased with her Toasted Cheese Sandwich.  And, taking to heart a dietitian's advice to include some healthier foods in her vegetable-free diet, raved about a refreshing and nutritious custom-made, green-colored smoothie laced with spinach that was modified with fruit at her request to camouflage the taste of the vegetable.  So, the friendly staff was very accommodating.  Seating at colorful tile tables on cushioned iron chairs was comfortable in a serene casual setting.  Ordering is done at a counter, and cooked food is brought to a diner's table.  Rachel's Kitchen appears to be a healthy alternative to fast food, with some bad boys, like a BBQ Bacon Burger, on the menu, too, for inveterate unhealthful eaters.",

    "text": "Had a quick lunch at Rachel's Kitchen during my lunch hour, and I can see why this cafe is a popular amongst the locals. Winning \"Best of Las Vegas\", Rachel's Kitchen offers fresh and tasty items at an affordable price with several locations around Vegas.   The cafe was quite packed for a Friday afternoon, with most of the tables occupied by families. The interior is comfortable and modern looking with fairly bright colors. Tables and chairs aren't the most comfortable, but they do what they need to do as most customers don't sit here for too long.   There's a good number of food items offered: salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, pasta, and breakfast (served all day). They also have juices, smoothies and coffee if you want to grab a drink to-go. Prices are a bit higher than I expected. Most healthy items seemed to be more than $10, and since I was watching the prices more than the calories, I ended up going with a burger.   I tried their sauteed mushroom cheeseburger ($10) along with a mixed green salad on the side. Portion was definitely larger than I expected. Burger was about the size of my hand, packed with mushrooms, swiss cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. The patty was 1/3 lb. ground beef - cooked well and super tasty. The minute I took a bite, I knew that my burger craving had been satisfied. Loved the cheese and mushroom loaded in the burger - had to ask for a side of ketchup just because I craved more sauce. I also appreciated the size of the salad. It wasn't a side salad but almost a single portion size. It came with sliced radishes, cucumbers, chopped tomatoes, carrots, etc. The vinaigrette dressing was quite nice as well.   Somebody else ordered a wrap while another person ordered a sandwich. The fries and fruit cup looked tasty, and I also like that they have a variety of options that you can substitute if you're watching what you're eating.   tl;dr - Super glad that I had the opportunity to dine here while in Vegas. Definitely want to try some of the salads and sandwiches, although prices are a bit steeper for those other items. They also have a kids menu for your little ones. High recommend this place if you're looking for fresh and tasty food!",

I got the 440 Sandwich which is grilled chicken, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, romaine lettuce and roasted tomatoes. You choose your type of bread, too. I also had a side of sweet potato fries. My brother got a BBQ Chicken Wrap and a side of French fries which he really liked. There are a lot of healthy items on the menu which I greatly appreciate! We will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!",

I visited the bathroom seconds after I ordered and then came directly back to the dining area.  My name was never called.   After seeing several people come in 10 minutes after me and getting their food quickly, I decided to go check on mine.  They pulled mine out of the fridge as if they put it in there because I wasn't around when they called me.  I am super disappointed that I tipped for service that took forever.  The muffin I got was super dry ---pretty much scone-like.  Very dry and crumbly.   I will say that the smoothie was decent.  Overall, not super impressed",

Lots of juicy chicken, roasted red bell pepper and tomatoes, goat cheese and avocados....simply delish. If you like goat cheese try this sandwich it pairs so well with the peppers and chicken, yummm!! A friend had the chicken Caesar salad. Chicken again was juicy and loads of breast strips on top of fresh romain lettuce and fresh parmesan cheese. Another friend had the curry chicken salad....amazing! Love the curry, not overloaded, so juicy and just the correct amount of curry (I also have had the chicken curry wrap before and it was amazing!). The last of our party had the signature salad with chicken....and again it was super amazing! How do i know what it all tasted like....cuz I just had to have a taste of them all, it looked so amazing! Super good food, average luncheon pricing for a downtown eatery (avg. $12-15).",

My boyfriend enjoys their curry chicken wraps and the burgers. The ambiance is pretty cool; laid back and the staff are friendly and the food comes out quick with no issues we have ever had. They have an extensive menu so maybe I'll live a little and venture out to try something other than the turkey club lettuce wrap or the egg white wrap (which is also scrumptious). Overall, the times we have dined there have been pleasant!",

There's a variety for breakfast and lunch options, as well as smoothies and fresh juices.  I was torn between the chicken salad sandwich and the grilled cheese, but opted for grilled cheese and my boyfriend got a turkey club sandwich (which was huge)! Our sandwiches were fine, but the price kinda stung at me a bit. I'd definitely come back here for the juices and smoothies though. I ordered just plain ol' carrot juice and I loved that it's made to order and it tasted so fresh.",

There's so many great items to choose from at this place.  To complement my mimosa I went with The Favorite which has eggs scrambled with basil, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and topped with avocados and goat cheese.

Every time I have been there it has been clean and the staff has been friendly. Outside dining is available, but I am not sure how useful in the summer.  I have tried the following and would order each one, again (and I have):  - Chopped Salad w/ grilled chicken: This is the ant-lettuce salad. It. Is. Big. A great blend of chopped broccoli, red cabbage, tomatoes, olives, garbanzo beans and mozzarella cheese with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I added chicken for protein, but it really doesn't need it. 5 stars out of 5, for me. - Cheese Burger: Standard cheeseburger, done right, I'd rate it 7/10. I usually get the sweet potato fries which are slightly sweet, tender with a bit of crunch. - Breakfast Burrito: I love breakfast burritos and this is pretty solid. I'd give it a solid 80% - Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich: Curry chicken salads are usually creative. This one was pretty normal, but the flavor is 'on point.' A solid b+.  I know this is a short review, but I am remiss in not finishing this sooner.",

I used to visit the hualapia location frequently when I lived on that side of town. Always friendly service and great food. After visiting this location and receiving rude service every time, I've decided not to go back.  Today my girlfriend decided we should give it one more chance and the same thing again. I really don't understand it. The younger girls that work at this location are smug and rude and impatient and they act like they can't stand you for whatever reason. I am friendly to everybody and to have such rude service at a place you really like sucks. I even tip them 20 percent or more and still the same. If someone is rude to you I can understand a little attitude back but the service here is flat out rude for no reason. It's not everybody either. Just one or two that I am unlucky enough to have to deal with in my experiences here. So for me enough is enough and I have visited this place for the last time.",

We noticed there is a small outside seating area with small bistro style tables.and inside Cafe style setting. Everyone was friendly when we walked in. There were a couple of tables with people eating at.  We did not know what they had that was good so we both decided on getting  the Turkey Club ~ Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo . We noticed they serve a lot of salads and wraps and healthy drinks. So they are geared more toward being a healthier place to eat at!  We enjoyed our visit and the food was fresh and good. The only thing I thought was the prices were a bit high but you get what you pay for and that is Fresh  I think we would go back and try something else.  The salads do look good. I read some of the negative reviews and I would say I am sure every place has their bad days we didn't see anything bad other than a few tables that needed to be cleaned off. No biggie! Why not Try it for yourself and you decide.",

I made mine a lettuce wrap, my wife had the whole wheat bun. They were soooo very good. So good, in fact, that we came back the next day and ordered the same exact thing. The lettuce wraps are well wrapped and I didn't want to pull it apart to put any condiments on it and therefore ate half of it before I noticed there was no swiss cheese and no mushrooms! It still had an excellent flavor (although not as good as the day before), so I didn't say anything. I saved the calories and made up for it with the sweet green smoothie. So good. One other thing to be sure to do is ask for a rewards card on your first visit as we didn't get offered one until our second visit. Strange since it was the same cashier! All and all, a very good place to eat with reasonable prices.",

I had the breakfast that they call, \"The favorite\". It was $9.75 plus tax for a very mediocre meal from a storefront restaurant. They barely put in any of the ingredients the eggs are supposed to contain. I got ONE piece of bread, and it was not even buttered, nor was there any jelly in the bag.

The sandwich has roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant. The eggplant was bitter and I had to take it out. The bread wasn't toasted enough to handle the vegetables and was soggy. And on top of that just had no flavor, maybe some hummus or vegan condiment might help? And the acai bowl had disappointing granola, if you could call it that. It was raisins and oatmeal. The acai part tastes like blended bananas, unripe bananas at that. And had hardly any \"acai\" flavor to it. Was just not worth it. The only good thing was the French fries and there wasn't enough to satisfy from the disappointment of the sandwich and smoothie bowl. I gave this place a second try but even going in starving I didn't find anything to satisfy my hunger. Oh I also got a juice and it was good but needed ice or at least colder than room temp.",

There was barely any chicken and most of it fell off when I picked up the sandwich. The fries were your everyday fries and the portion was tiny. The Mac n cheese was terrible. It was too liquidy.

Burrito did not list onions as an ingredient but was filled with them. No real flavor to the eggs and avocado. Potatoes were ordinary. Juice tasted too much like celery for my tastes. Won't get these again.   Typically, I like RK. Hopefully this location will be as good as the District one next visit.",

They were good but the place was small and so crowded and we just never made it down that way again.Now Rachel has a place up here in Centennial. We've been in a few times and I LOVE it. So many options for those who have to be gluten free. :D  Sandwiches and even pasta can be ordered gluten free. Sadly, wraps, burgers and pancakes don't have that option. But I'm not complaining. It is so cool to have somewhere I can go and actually order a sandwich!   Their 440 sandwich is soooo flippin good. I've also tried the smoked turkey and avocado. It was good but the 440 is just on an entirely different level. The protein lovers scramble is pretty awesome too. Very cheesy so if you are like my husband and like cheese just not A LOT of cheese, you might want to ask them to go easy.  Service is friendly, the prices are reasonable. Not really that much more than you'd pay anywhere else. The restaurant is roomy, bright and cheery. We'll be going back a lot. My goal is to try all their sandwiches but it will be difficult not to order the 440 again right away.",

I came in on a Friday morning with my wife. she ordered an omelette that had sun dried tomato in it. it was horrible. the sun dried tomato strips were inedible. Very chewy and you could not bite through it. the home fries that come with the meal are frozen. the two breakfast meals, one coffee and one small soda plus a $3.00 tip came to $30.00 dollars. it was very noisy inside. I felt like I was eating in a cafeteria more than a cafe. for that kind of money I will just go to a resteraunt that isn't self serve.",

The reality is that my experience was more consistent  with a two star review.   I bought dinner for 3  and was less than impressed.   The sweet potato fries were cold, extremely small portions and tasted undercooked .   The chicken sandwich (I think it was called Rachel's chicken salad)  was dry and bland.   The chicken salad was served with less than fresh lettuce and greens and very dry chicken.   The only decent thing that we had was the Turkey club but it was plain, and nothing to make in my worth the price.   All orders were served with the cold undercooked paltry serving.   What was interesting is that the lady before me brought her order back for a refund.   When she asked to speak to a manager she was told that there was no manager on duty and wouldn't be until tomorrow.   Final comment would be the staff.   They were not rude but they honestly could care less and there was no urgency, customer service or quality of service and it shows in the overall quality of the food.   All in with tip it was about 48.00 to feed 3.   I'm not sure if anybody will read this but it is a good concept, nice place but needs a major overhaul in management of this store",

Walked in and kinda feels like a cheap unorganized  Panera Bread , tables scattered all over no privacy when eating and weird. We made our way to the counter to order, the menu and order area is kinda strange lots of options and no clear selection  of what they do best ( all over the place with options). After a few min looking threw I went with what seemed a bit expensive burger and fries and the wife went with a BBQ chicken wrap. We then made our way to our table and waited , and waited , and waited like 15 min ( not a fast food joint but still felt to long).   The food  My burger was ok , not great but ok , the fries we good. I got the mushroom burger, it all tasted fresh and ok.  The wife's BBQ wrap was lacking BBQ , as in they forgot to put any BBQ sauce on it. It was literally just some chicken tenders in a wrap. Both her and I were not fans.   So all in all , it's not good it's not ok, it's an average attempt at a want to be trendy healthy joint. But it's not!!",

My hubby opted for the eggs, hash Browns,  two peices of toast.  The hash Browns here nice because they were not greasy.    I also had to have one of their fresh juices,  it had kale,  celery,  beet etc and was a great. Size at the large.  This is a must order.   Thus is a great place to go for a healthy fast food option.  Price is slightly higher then your tradition fast food but definitely worth the calories and eating organic.    If you are into gluten free they also have great pasta options for you.",

Loved the colors a bit sparse but comfortable   I didn't really feel like I was in a kitchen. There were employees cleaning silverware and tossing dishes under the front counter throughout the visit. It should be renamed Rachel's dishroom. It was very loud and noisy from all of the dish work going on right next to where you order and eat.   The food was good. Very tasty a bit pricey. The staff all smiled and was very accommodating and nice. Could have used a bit more kitchen feel and less i was in the dishroom. Doubt if would return.   $3 mimosa was a good draw though and delicious. Maybe for that.",

They messed up on my husbands order and had to take his food back after we waited about 15 minutes before it was served.   We both ordered chicken wraps, which seems like a relatively easy food to make, but it took a very long time before it came to our table. The server was nice and she was apologetic about the order being messed up, but it was rather frustrating that we had waited so long and now had to send it back.  If I had to give the owner a piece of advice I would say to move the blender to the back of the restaurant. It was right up front next to the order station and we had to repeat everything we said and the guy who took our order would never speak loud enough over the blender so it made for a very confusing ordering experience.  We won't be back - the cost of 2 wraps and 1 shared drink was $25. It was good, but not that good.",

I've been to this location a few times because my youngest daughter loves their smoothies, but the service is always very nonchalant, bordering rude. My daughter's and I visited yesterday and ordered 3 of the same type of smoothie. Immediately after we tasted them we all remarked that there were a lot of seeds this time but didn't really think anything of it. A few sips later I got what seemed far too large and flat to be a seed and unfortunately , I was correct.  All 3 smoothies were FULL of small pieces of stiff plastic!!! I had both girls check theirs as I did mine to make sure before I went back and it was unbelievable. Of course I went back.  I showed the manager on duty several pieces of plastic inside of each cup and her brilliant  response was and I quote , \" Oh, it must be coming off of the cups.\"  Not once did she or the very unfriendly young woman who made the smoothies apologize. She offered to give us more smoothies in the disintegrating cups or a refund. I find it ridiculous that they were not more concerned about serving customers indigestible and dangerous product...unless it was done on purpose. In either case the situation and their response is UNACCEPTABLE ! I will not be back and I suggest anyone wanting a healthy FOOD option visit an establishment that actually serves food...not plastic.",

The use of mayo in the wrap could be lessened, or cut out, but otherwise the food was good. The smoothies are on the sweet side. The use of frozen yogurt makes the drink more of a dessert than a meal supplement. Getting the Acaiberry smoothie without made all the difference.   The employees are always helpful and friendly. The initial greeting once you walk through the door sets the pace. They gave me time to look over the menu, but was ready to when I stepped forward.   The menu is broad and takes some time to navigate, but with a few modifications the food is fresh and delicious.",

Everything looked awesome, but I decided on chicken salad sandwich and sweet potato fries. Not only were the employees welcoming, but they told me about all their awesome deals and specials. They were extremely kind and helpful.  Next time, I'll take their suggestion and try ordering it ahead of time. The food still came out in under a couple minutes-about the time it took me to get my drink and start looking them up on Yelp. The sweet potatoes were hot and not an overwhelming portion. The bread for the sandwich was toasted perfectly! I was surprised how much chicken salad was given and it tasted super fresh! It's rare to find a place where you can clean your plate and not feel like you over-did yourself. I feel like I had a quality, satisfying meal without wasting food. Great job guys!",

I do,however, think the prices are a slightly bit higher than they should be. They're basically like a fast-casual diner... The in between of a fast food restaurant and a casual diner. If they were taking my order at the table, refilling my drinks, and checking up on me every so often I would understand these prices, but they're not. Also, service is very very slow.

    "text": "My husband and I live pretty close by and decided to try this place out.  The sandwiches and pastas sounded good and they serve breakfast all day...sounded promising at first!  Who doesn't love breakfast food at dinner?!  Well...then we looked at the prices.  Holy smokes.  These portions better be good.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and paid an additional $1.50 to add bacon.  My husband ordered a BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and we split a small soda.  Total came to about $22.  Whoa...we could have eaten at a sit down restaurant for that price.  :\\  We then proceeded to wait for 20 minutes or so.  It seemed to take forever.  When we finally got our food, we were a bit disappointed to see the portions.  My husband got literally 4 onion rings on the side and I expected my burrito to be a lot larger for nearly $10.  My breakfast burrito was just ok taste-wise.  I didn't like how it was pretty much all egg with hardly any salsa and I could barely taste the cheese.  For some reason the avocado wasn't spread out evenly throughout the burrito, just a big chunk of avocado on the end of the burrito.  They need to distribute the ingredients more evenly to balance out the tastes.  The part that really ticked me off was the bacon I paid an additional $1.50 for...The bacon was just tiny little chunks sprinkled throughout the egg and there was hardly any of it!  Seriously?  I paid extra for this?!  I couldn't even taste the bacon in it so I feel it was a total waste to get it.  Extremely disappointing and a total rip-off.  Overall, the place is just way too overpriced for average food.  We probably won't be coming back here.",

    "text": "My friend and I tried this place today, and it was very good. This is a positive addition to this area of town. We went for breakfast, and left full and satisfied. I had \"The Favorite\", a scramble with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, avocado, and herbs. It was delicious. I love goat cheese but had never had it with eggs before, and now I am definitely a fan. The potatoes tasted freshly made and were seasoned and cooked perfectly, seriously can't go wrong with this dish. My friend had the breakfast burrito which was pretty big. She couldn't even finish half and took the rest of it along with her potatoes home. It came with freshly made salsa, and she gave it all two thumbs up. Her two grandsons had banana chocolate chip pancakes (which I was totally jealous of), and a burger and fries (at 9 a.m.--teenage boys are weird). He said the burger was nice and moist, and I stole some of his fries--yum, for sure.   Service was fast and very friendly. The man who rang up our order and delivered our food came over to our table and talked to us for a while about the restaurant and some of the menu items. We appreciated that. I read a review that said the portions are too small for the price, but I would definitely have to disagree with that. We all had food left on our plates at the end of the meal, and we were happy and stuffed. As far as the price goes, as long as the ingredients are fresh and unprocessed, they can justify it. It's not fast food, and I don't expect to pay fast food prices.  I will definitely be back for lunch and a smoothie. I'm glad to have the addition of this type of place in the sadly ignored far N/W.",

    "text": "Where to start, you walk into the restaurant and it's very well put together. The color theme along with the decorations and sitting tables with chairs are all very warm and welcoming. I walked up to the counter to place my order and after having to wait several minutes for the cashier to get off a personal call to take my order I was already wondering if  made a good choice of going there, but from all the wonderful Yelp comments and suggestions I waited patiently.  I ordered a kids Chicken Fingers with Fries for my little 2 year old and a Mac and Cheese for myself, with our drinks the bill came out $19.85. Hmm a bit pricey if you ask me for small meals.  We sat by the window and waited, there were only 4 other couples in the restaurant waiting for their meals as well (which came in after us) but we were for some reason we were the last ones to receive our meal after waiting 28 minutes yes I timed it. I think the waiter realized that we had to wait a while and that my little man was really hungry since he ate his chicken nuggets even though they were still very hot, she offered us a cup cake and apologize for us having to wait.  My Mac and Cheese was good I couldn't believe the portion size since it ended up feeding my little boy and myself with still a little bit left over. The chicken fingers and fries umm not so good, the Chicken was hard and was very Tuff my little man didn't eat much of it and his fries were soggy which he also wasn't too interested in.  After being home for a few hours my little man had the worst upset stomach to the point I had to give him some medicine to calm his stomach and had to stay with him till he slept ( which is never needed for him). An hour after I started feeling the same stomach pains and both of us were sitting in the bathroom holding our stomachs and throwing up everything. I ended up having to take him to our local grocery store at 11 pm to get us something so that we could get some rest before our busy day ahead of us. Therefore my rating is only 2 stars, Staff each probably could learn more customer service skills and the food well I won't be eating there anymore. All in all the concept of the restaurant is nice and the ambiance but that's about it.",
