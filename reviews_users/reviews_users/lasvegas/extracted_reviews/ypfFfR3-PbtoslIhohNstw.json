Owner lady seems very nice.(at least I think she's the owner) I wish they had more side dish but unlimited steamed eggs(I don't know how they make it so good) and bean paste stew makes up for it. Place is very clean although you have to burn your cloth when you're done eating. : )  Service was good. nothing to really complaint about. maybe it's because they weren't that busy. I would definitely go back. It's yum yum yum.",

My friend was very amused by the shape of the octopus.  Very tasty and long to cook.  I didn't want to take any risks.  I had some of the rib eye and dang, they went all out and gave us the whole piece (about 8oz worth).  Very generous and I cooked it like a steak.  The soup was not what I expected.  I'm accustomed to the spicy tofu soup versus the paste type they had here. Poo.  Overall, the amount of meat given was very decent and they changed our grill plate after each plate of meat.  No burnt pieces.    I have been to several places where there weren't many condiments to chose from.  This place had so many! I tried each condiment, but wanted to avoid getting full since this is AYCE..  Atmosphere is very bright and modern looking.  Plenty of seating and spacious.  Metal type chopsticks.    First actual Korean AYCE I have been to here in Vegas.  Will have to try out some other places to get any idea, but this place is solid in my book!",

    "text": "Decent food, small portions, modern restaurant, newly revamped, poor service, cold shoulder with a friendly smile. Well it's nice looking since they remodeled after the fire, since we are Korean we thought it would be a good place to have a nice meal and it's located next to the only really good Korean supermarket in the Las Vegas valley. We ordered our lunch items and soon the standard banchan (side dishes) come out, about 2 teaspoons of macaroni salad, 3 pieces of potato, a teaspoon of black beans and a micro portion of over-ripe and stale kim chee. The bulgogi (bbq beef) was tender and well cooked, but really on the small side, the grilled eel is undercooked which makes the bones a hazard to eat since when throughly cooked the bones are edible. My bibimbap (mixed rice, with meat and veggies) was mostly lettuce and the chili sauce is not very good and probably store bought. We asked for a little more potato banchan and the lady acknowledged us, but never brought us anymore. Maybe she forgot or maybe she would rather keep 3 more tiny piece of potato for future use? Everyone is very welcoming when you first come in, but once you've started eating you are on your own. No asking if we need anything else, just the bill left on the table. No sliced orange or cold rice drink often served after a Korean meal. (Traditional Korean hospitality jesture) I don't know why Korean service is so poor, fake welcome and fake good bye. Skimpy portions, poor service, why come back here again?",

So I could have done this at home.  I asked them politely to please let us handle the cooking of the meat, they rush you, they will cut your meat over and over again; hello would you like us to enjoy our meal or do you just want me out of your restaurant?  So they don't care what you tell them, they will keep on coming by and cutting forever.  The money is not worth it, I don't even remember how much, all I remember is the distaste to pay and never to return.",

This kind of thing really grosses me out, especially because at this establishment, they cook for you at your table. There are some flies that kept landing on our food at the beginning. But once they began cooking the meats, the smoke kept them away. Still, gross. Also they mandate an 18% tip for a party of 5 or more. Usually it is 6 people or more that is considered a large party. Usually we tip them well here because they do cook for you, but I dont like being forced or told how much to tip, particularly when I am now questioning the cleanliness of this facility.

Not only are the dishes traditionally prepared, but the beef is high quality (USDA prime), and the rest of the meat is excellent in quality. The price is a little bit more than many of the other Korean BBQs in town, but truthfully, just try the AYCE and pick many of their dishes. I suggest getting the steamed egg, bean soup, extra kimchi, brisket, bulgogi, ribeye, and marinated pork and chicken for the end, so it does not ruin the flavor of the non-marinated dishes.  I highly suggest planning to spend 1.5 - 2 hours here as it takes a little longer to get your food, let alone cook it.",

I normally could care less about attitude however, from the first moment I stepped in the restaurant I was surprised that the hostess did not like the fact that I did not speak Korean (I am Korean by birth, adopted by white parents).    I didn't think too much of it until the waitress, who said 5 words to me acted as if I was a turd in the chair.  The food was very average, (pork bulgogi).  I only saw the waitress when I ordered and when the food was delivered to the table.  After that She decided to avoid the disgraceful Twinkie sitting in her section.    I wanted to see how long after I completed my meal it would take for some attention (or the bill).  I waited 25min until I had enough and I waved the waitress for my bill.  The stone face hostess didn't ask me anything just swiped my amex and off I went.   I would be ashamed to work in an environment where my employees never smiled or cared about their customers.  If your food is sub par, at least give great customer service.  I would only step foot in here to use the bathroom nothing more.",

It's now $33/person and all at the table must get ayce or nobody can.   Blah service - they were very nice since I had my Korean aunty with me, but also very forgetful despite it being empty except for maybe 4 other tables. Had to ask twice to get a refill on hot tea, I also ordered squid twice, which they then proceeded to forget both times. Only remembered once we were ready for the check and I didn't want it anymore.   Agree with what a couple other people said - they're ridiculously stingy with their banchan and since they rarely stopped by except the 2 times they brought food, it's hard to get things replenished. This dish with broccoli and soft tofu literally had 4 small florets, and they gave us 1 onion slice and literally 1 round slice of zucchini to grill for 3 of us. I don't get being so cheap with cheap things, it was just weird.    I'd only been here before just for soup, both of which were bland and forgettable. This town has a lot of other Korean places, and I don't think this one is worth your time or extra money. Actually, the kalbi was very good and since ala carte for that is around $30 - I'd say ayce could be worthwhile if they go back to not limiting you to 2pcs/person. But since that's very unlikely to happen - I say pass on this place.  oh one positive is that they did let me take home the big rib bones (with meat on it) for my dogs. I figured they'd say no since there's usually no leftovers with ayce.",

Maybe we're just picky and expecting too much. But, if you pay $8 extra to upgrade for a side of short ribs with your noodles, then you wanna at least feel like you got your money's worth, even if it wasn't the best tasting ever.   Just to compare, for 8 bucks you can get two Double-Double's at In-N-Out. Here, the same 8 bucks, got us one measly strip of thinly sliced short ribs with 4 bones. Three of them were decent but the 4th had about one square inch of meat on it, all of which was served on an exceptionally stingy bed of onions.   It was comical. Now, you can stop reading here and get a gist of this place in general. If you need any more reasons, the rest of this review needn't be long.   The side dishes were few, small portioned and bland to WTF?. The other dishes we ordered were the same. This place has a serious portion issue and nothing tasted any good.

What I loved was the meat quality you can tell immediately they are serving quality meats. On a lunch menu for all you can eat is a bit different than the dinner menu. Dinner menu has a better selection if you ask me. I wasn't a fan of the banchan here but the kimchee was amazing. My favorite meat was the marinated beef sirloin. Brisket was also good. Kalbi was not on the lunch menu and I was too full to order more anyway. A bit more than other KBBQ places but it's worth it. Wait staff is very attentive and friendly here we left happy and satisfied.",

I finally made it back during my last visit, and I'm sad to say it's just not as good as I remembered.   This is definitely a fun place to go if you are wanting the True Korean BBQ experience.  I thought the lunch price for the all-you-can-eat was a little steep with it being $23 per person, but there was a good variety of meats to choose from.  My brother was disappointed that the ribs were not a part of the lunch menu for all-you-can-eat, but they are for the dinner.  We also were confused on whether this price included tea, as he thought it did but it did not list this anywhere.    We enjoyed the spicy chicken, ribeye, and sirloin.  All the meats were really good also the ribeye was very fatty.    Service could have been better.  We asked for tea at the end of the meal which never came.  We gave it about 15 minutes before deciding to get up and leave.  Other than that and the price, I really enjoyed my experience at Lee's.",

The kimchi soup is suppose to have pork in it, and it had no meat. But it was still okay. The service was another thing that got me. The waitress, she wasn't friendly at all. She came up to our table after we were sitting here for 10 minutes, she didn't even say a word to us, just looked at my mom and myself as if we were just ready to order. Do they normally not greet people here ? Even if there was a language barrier, my mom speaks fluent Korean. She could at least tried to greet us. My water wasn't even refilled. I've been a server at numerous places , this isn't how businesses are handled. It was $40 dollars for lunch speical for 2 people and it didn't even taste good. Ugh!  2 stars because we still ate the food,but taking home a lot of it. I don't think I want to come back here though.",

Something has happened lately though to change my opinion. The service is terrible. A couple months ago my wife and I came with one of her friends for lunch and the service was so bad we were embarrassed to have brought our friend.  The person serving us was not friendly nor very interested in helping us.  So my wife and I try again tonight and it was worst. As we entered the restaurant a lady near the back just yelled and pointed at the front area and told us to pick a table.  We sat down waited for a while and no one came over to the table. We finally walked out and drove down the road to Sura Korean BBQ where the service was excellent. I hope Lee's BBQ reads this and improves their service as their food was pretty good.",

    "text": "Review of the AYCE BBQ!  The meat was delicious but the sides and slow service bring the overall rating down.  Party of 9 sitting at 2 tables.   Side dishes get 3/5: there are fish cakes, cole slow and some other non-memorable sides. They don't have the potatoes or seaweed salad. I would say that Lee's has the most disappointing sides of the other bbq places I've been to around the area.   Sides: bean soup, steamed egg ... steamed egg is good..pretty much a scrambled egg in a bowl mixed with some salt water  Meat: delicious. Apparently there is a special cut of meat (and expensive cut) that only Lee's has--this is what my krn friend said.  That 'special' meat cut was amazingly delicious and tender. They also have the standard bulgogi, kalbi and the pork bacon strips which I'm not the biggest fan of.   Service gets 2/5 for being so slow: we had empty plates pile up on separate occasions during our meal; empty meat plates and egg bowls that we were waiting to have cleared. We even had to wait a while for the check to come...you know that while where EVERYONE in your party is waiting for the check. Getting refills for water was also a little annoying.  Coke is ~$2.50 per can  They have nice chopsticks. Light but not thin.  They are easier to grasp than those standard thin krn chopsticks.   Saw Lee himself eating at the other table.   Overall, imo, Lee's is not the best korean bbq place in Vegas as others have said. The sides were meh and the service was slow.  Yes, they do have a special cut of meat here but for an overall excellent krn bbq experience, I recommend Honey Pig.",

We shared their combo which included bulgogi beef, tofu jigge, steamed egg, and house salad. It was a feast to remember - overflowing deliciousness left and right.   Both cuts of meats were juicy, tender, and so well seasoned! Both had the perfect amount of sizzling char - my mouth is watering all over again just recalling.   We counted many different banchans. After going through rounds of banchans multiple times, we continued to be surprised by our servers and their ability to pick out and refill the exact emptied banchan every time.   We would certainly be back to wow out of town guests.",

It probably helped the night even more - having more than half of the party being Korean :P   I've tried many Korean BBQ spots in town and hands down this is my favorite :).  I didn't feel cramped up in a small area or even overwhelmed by their BBQ smoke from all the meat sizzling.    The place was very clean (like most Korean restaurants).  The food would always come out organized and fresh.  All their soju and beer were always served nicely cold/hot.  Even their bathrooms were clean - that's a plus in my books :P",

Service was nothing spectacular.  But what can you expect... these places are not known for their service.  Waitress was brief, didn't talk much.  But they were helpful and somewhat fast whenever you needed a refill or more food.  Very pricey around $32 for all you can eat dinnner... rather spend a few more dollars and eat at Texas De Brazil...",

We ask for another bowl of rice, after 15 minutes I wave down a waitress (not mine) for rice. 10 mins later, still nothing. I ask our server again, and finally after a total of 30 mins, I get my bowl of rice... Needless to say, all my food is cold. With service like this, I'd rather go to aloha kitchen for my ribs and spend way less... Oh I forgot to mention that it also took 10 minutes to just get my check.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I hate to leave a bad review.   For me to leave a bad review, something very egregious must have happened, or something not quite so bad must have happened several times. In this case, it is the latter.  I have been to this restaurant several times, so my experiences reflect multiple bad encounters.   Before I get into the bashing, I'd like to state the only reason I have been back here after my first time, was at the promptings of friends. And I will indulge them as they are my friends and the quality of food is not bad. The few times I have been here, I have found the food to be enjoyable. However, the service has always been mediocre at best.  This last particular trip, however, will be my last.  Let me set the stage to start.  The place was not busy when we arrived, and it appeared at least half the lights were off.  I like natural light over harsh fluorescent, so this is not a complaint.  However, about halfway through the meal, all the lights came back on and the vents fired up with a loud \"Woosh!\"  It was like that scene from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I though I was going to get sucked up through the vent.  But my real complaint here last night was the service, it  was beyond horrible!  We were seated quickly and the table was set with the side dishes just fine.  Our order was taken, with some confusion, but once we were all on the same page, it was delivered timely.  It was some time later though before anyone stopped by again to check on us.  It was so long in fact, I turned off the grill as little pieces of whatever started burning on the grill.  I ordered more bulgogi, and it seemed like forever before some measly portion was finally delivered.  The lady plopped it down on the grill, then seemed annoyed it was turned off.  Once the grill started heating back up, I took to arranging the meat neatly and evenly around the grill.  Of course, I quickly ran out of the sesame oil and patiently waited for someone to stop by and check on us.  That never happened.  There was a table of Korean people seated next to us, who were seated after us, that the wait staff, and a lady who appeared to be in charge, where tripping over themselves to attend to.  It was actually comical how we were being annoyed.  After many many attempts to make eye contact, my wife actually spoke up with a loud voice to a passing server asking for someone to stop by.  That was met by a blank stare, and still,no one ever came.    We ended up standing up and walking to the register.  Had my family not been in tow, I would have simply walked out.  I complained to the lady I assumed was the manager.  She rang us up as I was complaining, said she was sorry and told me the total.  I don't think she could have cared less!  I made a point to put a 0 (zero) on the tip line and signed the receipt.    To be fair, had this terrible dining experience not happened last night (I decided to sleep on this before taking to Yelp), I would not have ever reviewed this place.  But since I am on a roll, I will give it a review outside of my experience last night.  I like KBBQ, and although I have not tried them all, I have tried a few places and have enjoyed some more than others.  Here is my review of Woonam Jung Lee's Korean BBQ.  At Woonam Jung, you order your meats with the servers, and then they bring the meat to you. I have a couple friends that like this place because it is not \"self serve\", and they perceive this as being more sanitary.    Side dishes are plentiful, and are presented in a visually appealing and appetizing way.  They have a papaya one that is very hot and amazing delicious.  However, although I have been here a few times because friends wanted to go here, it is not my go to place and would not choose this place on my own.    First, even though the food is fine, the service is so bad that it does not make it worth the trip!   I mean, service is consistently bad.  And looking over other reviews, I am not alone.  Service always has been good when you first walk in, but follow up service is non-existent.    I like the self-serve style KBBQ places.  I can get exactly what I want, and exactly how much I want.  No waiting for a server to drop by and take my order, then wait to have it delivered.    I like the sesame oil with salt and pepper.  At Woonam Jung, they bring you such a small amount that  I usually have to ask for more several times.  I also like the garlic and  jalapeno peppers.  Again, they bring such a small amount I have to ask several times for more.  I understand they are probably trying to avoid waste, but the small amounts they offer comes off as stingy.        Overall, the service is so consistently bad it overshadows anything good or unique about this place.  I have tried to like this place, but unfortunately it is not happening for me.  And given my last experience there, can honestly say I will never go back.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Service Buttons - I love places with the service buttons. This one has 3 (Bill, Water, Service), so you don't have to try to flag someone down when you need help. They come to you.        - Decor - Granite table tops, glass dividers, new and fancy grills. This is a way better date place.        - Price - They are a lot pricier than other places for Dinner ($17.99 Tofu Hut) and their Lunch cuts out a lot of the good meats. With that said, it does seem the quality of meat is higher here.        - Quality - The quality of meat is a lot higher than many of the other places. With the exception of how the beef brisket was marbled, the marbling on the other meats were really great.        - Grill - They use the circular grill like at Honey Pig. I think I prefer it over the rectangular ones since it lets the fatty meats you put on there first coat the grill. easier.        - Presentation of Meat - I like how they place all the meats on one plate for you instead of giving you multiple plates. It saves on the space and looks really nice (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/woonam-jung-las-vegas?select=mOHA27w4OjYu9GKKR_UejQ#mOHA27w4OjYu9GKKR_UejQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/woon...</a>).        - Service - We came for lunch, but got the dinner AYCE. They put the meat on the grill for you when they bring the plate of meat and change the grill out for us without us asking when the marinated meats charred the grill.        - Tofu Hut Comparison - Tofu Hut is a lot cheaper, but it also looks worse and the marbling on the meat fluctuates between very good and terrible even on the same visit. I'd say it's a toss up between that place and this depending on how much you want to spend. **Price**        - $17.99 Lunch        - $27.99 Dinner **Ordered**        - Marinated Beef Short Ribs - They sere the beef with the bone still on the end.         - Rib Eye Beef - It came out as just as slab of unmarinated steak. Cooking it on the grill, it gets tough/dry quick and didn't have flavor. Maybe I'm not adding some sauce to it I should of.        - Beef Brisket - Not really marbled well, just had a lot of parts with fat. The parts without fat were a little dry.        - Beef Tongue - This was marbled perfectly. We got 3 helpings of this.        - Beef Belly - This tasted like a better marbled version of the beef brisket. I usually love beef brisket, but I think I\"ll get         - Pork Belly - I think I prefer the marinated version at Tofu Hut. The unmarinated one didn't have as much flavor.        - Side Dishes - I guess I'm used to Tofu Hut. They didn't have the same salad. Also, my favorite dishes, seaweed and fish cake weren't there (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/woonam-jung-las-vegas?select=7Z_ZaeOeTwp9ZE52sjhTlw#7Z_ZaeOeTwp9ZE52sjhTlw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/woon...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a quality AYCE Korean BBQ place.",

The marinade they used was very tasty. The papaya salad that I ordered was just a tad too spicy for me.   Meats were very fresh and the sides were traditional so nothing special to add there. They did not switch the grill in between sessions of cooking, but the waitress always helped to clean it and grill some meats for us, too!

    "text": "My friend Leo and I love going to Lee's back then. We used to be regulars, practically coming in every other day for some late night korean bbq. Both of us work late nights, so we rarely get the chance to go get kbbq with our friends, so we opt out of eating at like midnight to 2am. We love the quality of the meat, the toppoki appetizer (that only this kbbq seem to have), however the service is miserable. The service is so bad that we have stopped going to Lee's and started going to Biwon because their service is so much better.   Our most recent visit was at 3am. Biwon was closed so we went back to Lee's because we missed the quality of the food and we were craving it. Our server was named Jin, we have had her before and we usually forgave her bad service because it was generally busy when we go. This time, there was only 2 other table. One table was an employee table (because after they finished, they cleaned up, wiped the table and went into the kitchen) and the other was a customer table. We were seated in a different section, she took our order and ask what we would like for drinks, but it took 20 minutes to get anything out. We got the food before we got our water. When we were done with our water, and ready for the next round she was no where in sight. Luckily, we were able to serve ourselves some water because the pitcher was right next to us, but she gave us a dirty look when we did.   Lastly, she turned off our grill even though we were still hungry and ready to go for another round. Instead, we lost our appetite and just asked for the check. We've been to lees before during earlier hours and had fantastic service then, but I guess if you're going after midnight you'll just be treated like shit regardless.",

    "text": "Don't underestimate this place based on the exterior. I thought this place was some hole-in-the-wall spot based on how unpresentable it looks. Since we were craving for some AYCE KBbQ and this is one of the highly reviewed places we decided to stop in here at 7:30a.m. Yeah, great thing, it's open 24 hours!   The AYCE BBQ menu is a bit limited to what I am used to in Los Angeles standards, hence my knock off of one star. Also the price is a bit higher than L.A. for what you get.  The interior was shockingly nice! IT's gorgeous inside with multiple T.V.'s bolted on the walls, marble tables, and brand new vents. Apparently, they had a fire and renovated this entire restaurant entirely a few months ago. It's clean, and brand spanking new!   Lunch option until 3p.m. - $21.99 for AYCE.  It comes with limited meats such as beef brisket, pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, and some other things. My main point is, there are NO short ribs or beef tongue in this option. What it DOES come with that most other AYCE places don't have is the Ttuk Pokki (korean rice cake). It was overly sweet, since they added too much sugar so the flavor was off.   Brisket was legit. Pork spicy marinated bulgogi was on point 5/5. Beef bulgogi was okay. Side dishes were quite good.   Dinner AYCE is $26.99. And it has marinated short ribs in this menu, but there's some limit to the order I believe.   If you're craving for AYCE KBBQ at a nice place, this place is definitely a great place to try. The service was stellar here, but I don't know if it's because no one else was really there at 7:30a.m. I mean, who the heck eats that stuff at 7:30a.m. anyway.   Note: The restaurant has plenty of none AYCE options. It's worth giving a stab at their other regular dishes and soups available. WILL BE BACK!",

The food was delicious; the all-you-can-eat option is an OK deal for $29.99 a person, but the catch is the entire table has to order it.  Really, the food was good, but the unfortunately the salient point of the experience was the poor quality of service.  Our waitress was slow and uninterested.  I ordered a Hite on three separate occasions and not only did it not materialize, she also seemed aggravated that I reiterated my request.  We hardly got any refills with our water, and our check took literally 45 minutes to appear.  And we had to ask a different waiter for it.  Again, the quality of food was great, but if you are like me and prefer waiters to not act like they hope you catch fire merely by occupying a seat, I would not recommend Woonam Jung.",

    "text": "One experience can ruin an entire place. Tonight was that experience for Lee's Korean BBQ (Woonam Jung). Not only was the service terrible, but I felt genuinely discriminated against.   When my roommate and I walked inside, I noticed that the restaurant was busy, so while I was prepared to wait a minute, I was not prepared to be completely ignored by the hostess while she ran from behind the register to deliver something to a table. I figured she would at least acknowledge us upon returning, but instead she went to the kitchen for a few minutes before finally greeting us, which was a relief, since I was starting to think that I had somehow managed to turn invisible. She told us that it would be about ten minutes, and then we sat in the little waiting chairs.   About five minutes later, another party came in. This was a party of three. They sat down next to us to wait as well. Somewhere between five and ten minutes later, a second party of two entered and stood at the counter. At this point, the hostess says something while gesturing toward a table. Logic dictating that since we were the first arrival, we would be the ones to be seated, I stood and took a step. The hostess quickly shattered the notion with a halting gesture while ushering in the party of three.   The party that arrived five minutes after me.   I got angry for a moment, but my roommate pointed out that maybe they seated the party of three first because a larger table was ready first. Grudgingly calmed for a moment, I settled back into my seat. Of course, when the waitress returned and seated the pair of gentlemen that entered AT LEAST ten minutes after us, I may have had a minor meltdown.   I explained to the manager that there was a chance that her restaurant may just be kind of busy and extremely disorganized, but it kind of felt more like we were ignored because we were the only one of the parties that greeted the hostess in English rather than Korean.   Any rational human being probably would have left by this point, but this had become a matter of principle. The manager apologized profusely, and my roommate and I followed the hostess to our table.   Gods below, I wish I were a more rational human being. At least the waitress got our first order of meats correct, and didn't bring something completely unwanted to the table. Meanwhile, the bean paste soup was the first item I had ordered. After three attempts, it was the last item to arrive. Our drink order took two tries, as did our request for hot sauce. And refills? Yeah, if I would have held my breath I would probably be typing this from the beyond. None to be had. I shudder to imagine how this would have went if not for the poor girl bussing tables. Even she was practically ignored when she attempted to bring the waitress back to our table.   After waiting ten minutes for our check, I quickly paid and gave far more gratuity than was remotely deserved and got out of the place as fast as possible.   From now on, I'll take my business elsewhere.",

Service is not terrible, they try to get you all your food quickly and are pretty nice. Awkward moment happened today tho haha. I left a cash tip and went to pay with my card, as we got up to the register the server picks up 2$ from the table and asked \"only 2$ tip?\" Hahaha I was so confused and told her that there's more on the table . She checks, picks up the rest of her tip and says sorry. Then she rings us out. I even heard her say to another lady in Korean than \"he only gave us 2$\". It was an interesting end to my lunch haha. All I could think was damn, I would've gotten fired my last job if I said that to a customer lol.

The grill is pretty authentic and the kimche is the best I've had outside of Seoul. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Korean BBQ. The only downside is the price.

Especially the beef tongue, ribeye, and the beef short ribs. My only gripe is the lunch menu is very limited and doesn't offer the best goods.

Anyway I didn't give them 3 stars because of that. The prices are high and I really didn't notice the increase in quality that much.  Then again I am not Korean. If the meat doesn't have gristle, not brown from age, and tasty then it's considered great Korean BBQ. I've eaten at all the popular Korean BBQs on Spring Mtn. I was surprised when Lee's also bought this place. That firewater makes a ton of cash from getting people drunk apparently. This is one of those places that if you have a Korean friend, you'd want them to come with you so that you will get the best service, kind of deal. Luckily we did and she is one bossy lady too. But I don't think I would come by myself. Is it really worth the trouble to have to, like grovel, to pay more and get less? I was never one of those guys so I only come when I get dragged here. As far as it being superior to others, I really can't tell. Then again, my palate leans toward Average Joe and not \"look at me\" Kimye.  I really don't think the food is worth the premium here, kinda like Mothers down the road. What's the big deal about them too???? I ate there and I didn't see what the fuss was about. Okay, so the decor is nice.... To me, Sura, Honey Pig, Tofu Hut all are good in their own way and I don't feel like I was unfulfilled when I leave those places. The prices and food fit although that dang Sura has cut down quite a bit on food. Raise the prices by a few bucks but keep the old food and quality( and it will still be cheaper than here)",

Not everything was amazing. The gaeran jim (steamed egg) was burnt and you could taste it throughout. The other meats we ordered were decent, but other KBBQ joints do it just as well. And the service, though quite good at first, seemed to grow weary of our non-stop ordering. But I won't fault them for that. We were a demanding bunch.  The kalbi alone earns them five stars.",

I've (personally) never had to wait for more than 15 minutes to get a seat, and I've been here on Christmas; with parties ranging from 2-8 people.  They are open ALL year, 24/7, and considering that, I'm surprised that the workers aren't always cranky.   The restaurant is extremely clean; the grills don't look over used, there's never anything on the floor, and their bathrooms are also always tidy.   My go-to KBBQ joint.",

    "text": "Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. Eight people.   Clean, space looks great, brightly-lit. The grill is tiny for a table of six! We made a reservation for ten people so we can all eat together. That's the whole point of a birthday dinner right? They gave us two separate tables of six. How awkward to shout over another table to tell a joke heh.    I dislike how every. single. time. I try to show up fashionably late to any friends' gathering, I somehow manage to always be the first one there! Dinner starts at 8? Cool, I'll get there at 8:15 because I know how slow everyone else is. No dice, they get there at 8:20. Oh geez. So I'm stuck there sipping water as I pretend I'm a bored housewife.  Anyway. We decide as a part of a group to get the Couples' Special and the Woonam choice. That was split and enough for the five of us that decided to share.   FOOD:  All the meats were flavorful and delicious. Kalbi was the star of the show. The grill at a table of six was pretty small though. They didn't turn on the fan for the whole meal until the very end. We didn't realize they even had one until it started! Who else like meat perfume?   Perfectly seasoned and each piece of meat was like butter after cooked. Smooth and good choice. Marbled meat was pretty. Pork belly was salty enough on its own, but a bit overpowering with slight extra seasoning.  SERVICE: For the whole meal, we had to flag down our server. They checked up on us maybe a couple times during the beginning, but stopped coming for the rest.  We asked for water twice. Didn't come back for 15 minutes until we asked again. Important to note that it was not busy for the time of night. We were the only table on one side of the restaurant with plenty of servers abound.   We received only one soy bean soup, and they forgot to give us the other one. When we asked for it, the server acted surprised and said that it must have been served at another table. No \"sorry\" whatsoever even in korean. We never got our second soup for the entirety of our meal.  When we went to pay, we all pulled out our cards/cash to split the bill. Note that we did NOT ask for separate checks. The cashier looked irritated, sighed loudly and said in korean to her co-worker: \"Oh my god. What a hassle!\" My friend (birthday girl, mind you) just paid it all in cash to make it easier for them. Wow.    VERDICT: Great food. Horrible service. I wouldn't come back based on service alone. Not so sure I would want to come back to a place when workers talk about you behind your back in another language when we politely ask for the food/drinks we're paying for.",

It was just as expensive as the raspberry wine which is expensive to begin with. Also gratuity is added to the bill so you can't control how much you tip based on service which was awful btw. Also the workers like to talk sh*t about you in korean among themselves.  The side dishes were pretty good though. They are overpriced in my opinion for some of the stuff. Also since gratuity is included I suggest you make the workers work for it since they didn't for us. Also sometimes they cook for you and sometimes they don't.",

There's also a lot more types of meat to pick from, granted it is $27 for dinner. Lunch is ~$18; I believe the prices went up since the last time I was there. There's not much for me to say about service because it really depends on who's serving you and how busy they are. I don't really have too many complaints yet. The restaurant is a pretty good size so I'm not too worried about making reservations unless you have a large party.  There's a lot of marinated meats (your typical ones like brisket and galbi) and a few non-marinated meats like pork belly and ribeye beef. They also have toppokki (spicy!) and steamed egg :0D. I'm sad that they don't have tripe :(.  It's definitely worth a try but maybe not too often due to the price. It's definitely a pretty good deal for the amount of different meats they have. It's just not a good value to me since I don't eat much and I only like certain types of meat. Voila!",

    "text": "This review is for the UYE just held here in the opening month of 2013, graciously hosted by Jen S.  After not having partaken in Korean BBQ since about 2006, this was a really fun event for me.  And my 3.2 lb. temporary weight gain the next day showed that the AYCE eating was pretty intense, too.  Fortunately, I dropped over 5 lbs. since then.  While Nelson Q.'s and Jen. S's table boasted some heavy eaters like Nelson Q. himself, Paolo D., and Jieun L., and finished off 5 rounds of food, my table that consisted of myself, Tony T., Bobby Y., Misti Y., Anthony M., and Ife A. were no slouches either.  In fact, although we may not have packed in as much total meat as our friendly neighbors just to the south, we polished off 9 rounds of food.  Yes, I was counting!  Never underestimate the eating prowess of Misti Y. and Bobby Y., who can be formidable eaters if it suits their fancy.  And Tony T., our masterful grill chef, who taught me that Jalapeno Peppers taste even better when cooked, just kept eating and eating amidst his cooking tasks.  Anthony M. ate his fair share, and took very few, if any, photos.  And, poor Ife A. kept getting blasted by dense smoke from the grill, which seemed intent on striking only her.  Most food served was very tasty.  But the quality of the marinated Kalbi we were served in different rounds was inconsistent.  One batch was melt in your mouth delicious, but another was noticeably tough.  And at our table, service was mixed.  At first we could barely get our server's attention.  And, I had to ask for water 3 times and then after hearing \"Okay!\" wait another 10 minutes, and watch 2 new diners be brought water glasses by our very server before any water refill was delivered to deal with the Spicy Boneless Sliced Pork before me.  One of my dining companions remarked, \"Maybe she said, 'Nokay!\"  After this, we became more assertive in asking for replenishment of finished off items, and soon enough all was fine and we were eventually bombarded with water bottles and even a pitcher of aqua.    We were not as adventurous as the hungry Hawaiian and his cohorts, so did not order any Beef Intestines.  But we enjoyed waves of Beef Short Ribs (Kalbi), Rib Eye Beef, Spicy Boneless Sliced Pork, Beef Brisket, Beef Tongue, Baby Octopus, and Pork Belly, as well as fluffy Steamed White Rice kept hot in tiny shiny silver pots, Kimchi, Bean Sprouts, White Onion, Jalapenos, and Steamed Egg that was like a great souffle.  I also very much liked a bowl of hot Bean Paste Soup, and had to acknowledge that a Baby Octopus actually tasted good, and so did Beef Tongue.  To the restaurant staff's credit, grills were changed periodically to avoid the meat sticking to them, and our server and other crew members never complained about our prodigious ordering and eating.  With a stiff monetary penalty if we left half a pound of food behind hanging over our heads, we did consume all we ordered during our 2 hour and 20 minute dinner.  5 stars for the companionship, witty conversation, and fun at this UYE; and kudos to host Jen S. for arranging this fine event; to the restaurant staff for serving us; and to Tony T. for deftly utilizing his professional cooking skills on our group's behalf.  4 stars for the food and service.  4-1/2 stars overall!",

The restaurant wasn't busy either and most of the workers were just standing there. What was ridiculous was that a Korean party came in a little after us and were seated next to us and they were served menus, water and the servers also took their order while we sat there for 15 minutes being ignored before we decided to walk out. And before all of that, they switched us to a smaller table because they felt that the original table they chose for us was too big. Workers are rude also. NBD. 3 new KBBQ just opened in town.

We did not leave smelling like we bathed ourselves in smoke room and the food was quite tasty!  We were having one of those family lunches where the boyfriend was being introduced to our cousin's parents... It was a wee bit awkward but with so much going on the grill, the newbies to KBBQ, cousin's boyfriend did ok lol. I'd consider this place to \"introduce\" a person or some sort of news here.  This place has got to be the cleanest KBBQ I've been to. From the table side cooking, the restrooms and how quickly the servers cleared the tables of used tableware. Unfortunately the gals serving us the day we came in, they were pretty bad at refilling our drinks.  The meats were flavorful but mild enough so to not have to burp up the flavors later on in the day, hooray! I would've liked more veggies, yea, I don't eat as much meat as my companions and I came to the wrong place if that's what I was looking for, but damn, veggies are cheaper than meat, they could spare another onion and 2 more mushrooms, can't they?! One other thing was that they used \"fancy\" square tableware and there was more plate/bowl than there was food on it which leaves less table to put things like your drinks let alone your cellphone. They should really skip the fine dining attempt, food is being cooked at the table, fine dining-- not here.",

Nothing will be spared, and no one is safe.  Ok, now that the dramatics are over, this place was AHH-MAAAYYY-ZIIIINNNG! I mean, $26 bucks?!? All the delicious meat, seafood, and veggies I can manage to shove down my gullet hole?!? Angry Korean moms as servers, yelling at you every time you mess something up?!? It doesn't get a whole lot better than that.  I had never been to a place like this before, but I quickly became comfortable after the group of people I was with assured me I would love it. It's actually pretty exciting. You are sitting at this large table, with something in the middle of it that you can light on fire. That, in and of itself, is pretty damn cool. I love interactive eating experiences.   My favorite OF COURSE was the Kalbi/Galbi beef (short-ribs). My table figured out that if you heat up the grill and can get it to the perfect  temperature (not too hot, but not too cool either), then you will get the most tender, perfectly cooked meat that practically melts in your mouth. It's an art I guess lol.  Since it was all you can eat, we ordered a little bit of everything that tickled our fancy. There was baby octopus, pork belly, beef tongue, spicy chicken and pork, you name it. And almost all of it was good. The only one I was not really feelin' was the octopus, mainly because, as my new friend Anthony M. stated, the octopus was just plain. No seasoning or marinade, no lemon or anything to really put on it... So it just ended up tasting a little basic.  The sides were really tasty as well, like our steamed egg, soup, and perfectly cooked rice that even came in it's own little metal container to keep it warm.   Honestly, our table pretty much devoured everything as soon as it was brought out!! Misti Y. and I tapped out early, but the guys kept ordering more and more meat. There was no end in sight!! I seriously think they ordered like, 10 lbs of meat. No joke. We certainly got our money's worth.  I would more then recommend anyone who has not tried this place yet to stop in and give it a go. It's a really fun experience, and the food is great too. Just be careful where you sit at the table.  I sat in a booth against the wall, and I swear, all the smoke from the grill came straight at me!! By the end of the night, I felt like I had smoked a pack of Marlboro cigarettes, and smelled like a burned-down meat packing facility. But it was well worth it :)",

Also they seem understaffed so they seem to be rushing you to make an order. Authentic Korean food! I loved the broth of the Galbitang. Kim Chee was fresh and good also part of Banchan which is the Korean word for mini-side dishes.",

    "text": "The place was great when it first opened and a few times after that. WHAT happened? Quality of the food definitely went down and so did the service. The Kalbi was all gristle and talk about skimping on the Panchan (small side dishes), which came out late. They usually bring those out right away. We saw tables that got theirs even though they came in quite some time after we did. We came between 7:00p till about 8:30pm and the service was SLOW. The part that really got under our skin was the unbelievably RUDE and un-attentive waitresses we had that were waiting on us. Definitely not the norm for Korean restaurants. They never smiled. Had no patience. And when my mother asked one of the waitresses a simple question about the side dishes the table next to us was getting (as they had the side dishes we used to get the first few times we came to the restaurant--A LOT more and varietal), she literally gave my mom a dirty look and blurted out an answer that neither of us could understand. My mom looked at me and I had no idea what she had said so, my mother asked again. I don't know if the woman was speaking Korean because it sure didn't sound like it to us and that's my mother's native language. Regardless, she was annoyed because we kept on asking her what she was saying. The woman literally walked away. It was time for the check. It's sad because we really liked this place and always had a good experience before. Granted, we used to come during the day but, it still doesn't give them the excuse to have terrible staff in the evenings not to mention, lower the quality of their food. That was definitely disappointing to say the least. The bathroom had a bad leak of some sort in one of the stalls, there was a pool of water in the stalls. I mentioned it to one of the staff members because someone could slip and fall. The woman didn't even stop to listen to me.",

They have this raw beef and inside they wrap it with a variety of different vegetables: MMMMMmMMMmmMM!!!!!! SO good! It is a MUST every time we go. They used to have it as one of the combo's but I'm not sure if they changed that, but either way, when we do all you can eat, we must order this on the side. NOMTASTIC.  They will typically cook the food for you at your table but once in awhile when we go we are on our own with that, but that's fine too.  If you are consuming AYCE, EVERYONE at the table must participate and will be charged. That kind of annoyed me since my daughter was with us when we were stuffing our faces and didn't eat ANY meat or anything except some of her rice, yet she was still charged the full price. They could change that up or at least have a kid price since they typically don't eat as much as adults do.  I've been trying some things on the menu, rather than just the Kbbq.  For Kbbq, this is my favorite spot.  The rest of the food is OK.   Yukejang could be A LOT spicier!",

I don't come here for service, I come here for the food and atmosphere. I usually get the short ribs, brisket, octopus, tongue, and occasional pork belly. They have two separate prices for ayce depending on if you want the full menu options. We also got the samgye tang! Very nicely prepared with tender chicken. Their banchan is delicious! One of the rare places that serve mac salad and super spicy papaya salad. Yum!!! The restaurant is very clean. Marble granite countertops with.

Your server assists you throw the meat on the grill and cook it while you get to enjoy all the cold Korean sides.   Overall, I thought price was reasonable for an all you can eat Korean BBQ--they replaced kimchi and other items as well. The all you can eat choices for meat were many and I was impressed by the amount of choice. Considering how much meat you get and the overall quality of the meat, I thought it was fair and reasonable price.   Staff was friendly, and the overall atmosphere good.

    "text": "Update: After I left my initial review on Lee's BBQ members from the marketing reached out to me and wanted me to give the restaurant another chance. They were very apologetic that my experience wasn't a pleasant one, and explained that they were making improvements. I was actually very pleased that they reached out to to me though that was very professional. And I agreed to come back. Last night at the spur of the moment my husband decided he wanted to go back and give it s try. I contacted the marketing team through Yelp and let them know. Ben was who I was in touch with, and he promptly called the restaurant to let them know about my experience From last time.     Immediately I noticed the tone of the restaurant was different, they had control of the floor and all customers looked happy and well taken care of by the servers. Also I want to add that there was enough servers for the busy crowd. We went in at about 8pm last night (Sunday) and the restaurant was slammed, every single table was taken. And there was also many large parties. The servers were attentive and food food was served fast, our salad and side dishes were on the table before Ben even called the restaurant on our behalf. And the grill was changed half way into our meal; which was a contention I had with our last visit. The grill wasn't touched at all. The drinks were refilled promptly and our meat kept coming, there was no limit on how much we could order at a time like there was last time. Our server Jenny, who was incredible by the way; noticed my daughter had hurt her finger when she touched the octopus too early right after we took it off the grill. She kindly got an ice cube and put it on her finger for her and calmed My daughter down.     As a whole we really enjoyed this visit, but not only that it looked everyone else was really enjoying their time as well. And they were operating at full Capacity on a busy weekend night. I've changed my railing from a 1 Star to a 5 Star, to see original review scroll down. I do recommend this place now, and it's very convenient since it's located right next door to Greenland, the Korean Market. My family usually likes to eat at Lee's BBQ and then go load up on Korean groceries for the house! Thanks again to Ben and the team at Lee's BBQ it was a great experience last night!  . . . . . Original Review: Horrible service, understaffed during dinner rush on a Sunday night. This is GO-TIME for restaurants in the Vegas Valley, the fact that the management can't have the foresight to FULLY staff their restaurant during the busiest time of the day and week is absurd. There was two servers on the floor, with a full house! Customers were desperately trying to get basic things for their tables, getting refills, or just ordering more meat. Which it's important to mention that you can only order 3 orders of meat at a time. I understand they do they do this in order To not waste food, but if they can't even get to the tables in time to keep the food coming, then what's the point?! When customers would try to get the attention of the one of the two hostess, they would say \"I'm not a server\" even though they can clearly see the floor is slammed.    And to put a cherry on top of the shit show that has been our experience, we were getting substandard service compared to the other \"more\" Korean quests. I'm half Korean, and my husband and his family are Thai. We are here with my daughter, and it's clear that the other guests who are Korean were getting the best service possible in this disaster.    Like another reviewer said, there's so many other Korean BBQ establishments available in the area. Even some in the outer perimeter of the Valley. Even though the BBQ meat was a good, we got no help from the staff, which is customary at Korean BBQ joints. My bibim naengmyeon was not good at all, with no variety of crunchy veggies to go with it, which is customary. Also, there was no grill change in the middle of our meal, and by the end we were cooking on a grill that was very crusty and not heating the meat evenly, with a lot less surface available to cook at all.     I'd recommend Sura Korean BBQ, which in the same area. Or Moo Woo Korean BBQ which is in Centennial. The staff at those locations are actually happy to be working and offer exemplary customer service each time. With food that is always consistent. We are extremely patient when we go out to eat, and this experience has completely pushed us to our limits. Never coming back. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!",

    "text": "This Korean BBQ spot is very underrated. First , I love that it's open 24 hours & surprisingly they have great customer service here whenever I dine in. The whole restaurant is actually very clean too. It's located closeby Greenland Market (on the far right side of the plaza). My favorite AYCE KBBQ spot in Chinatown is Hwaro for it's variety but when I only want a lot of brisket and just a few sides (which includes just salad , steamed egg and hot tofu soup for me) then Lee's is definitely the place to go to. Plus , their wait times are not bad at all. We're often seated right away here. I usually get their Combo C (which is their cheapest option for 19.99$) since I'm satisfied with just brisket (although I tried their other options and they're excellent as well). Meat quality is very good for an AYCE place compared to other AYCE places around town. They aren't stingy with the meat portions either. Must also mention that their bulgogi is perfectly marinated. I hardly order bulgogi at AYCE besides this place. Make sure to ask for fermented soybean paste on the side for your meats. The cast iron grill they use is so efficient. Meats don't stick on the grill and grill is very easy to clean.",

Don't know her name and don't care as she doesn't care for customers either. I know this cause I've eaten here many times and she still doesn't remember my face. Today I decided to give a extra star because of two waitresses named JINA Unnie and HeeJung Unnie who always goes extra miles to make sure you have everything you need. And treat you kindly with sincerity and smiles. Thank you for always being kind. HeeJung Unnie I hope to see you when you're working too!",

    "text": "I really like Lee's Korean BBQ. Sure there are other options for Korean BBQ but I always come back to Lee's because the food just tastes better and the meat is of better quality than most of the other AYCE restaurants.  I come in with a party of two to three most times so grill space is not an issue. I have a set standard of 4-5 meats that I always order so I know what I'm getting as soon as sit down. A couple of my favorite things to see are a few thin sliced Rib Eye steaks or a huge platter of thinly sliced brisket go down on a hot grill and sizzling. I'll order another round before the first turn of the meat because I want to keep the party going. The Galbi and Bulgogi are outstanding too. There are no sliced onions in the Bulgogi, it's all meat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The standard Banchan is available with other options on the menu.  I have seen some lower scoring reviews on the topic of service, but my personal experiences with service at Lee's Korean BBQ have been great.  I appreciate the service of someone tending to my grill and taking care of me. I have even found a favorite server. Once again, I can only comment on my personal experiences and I am not looking to discredit the experiences or opinions of other Yelpers. I will continue to visit Lee's Korean BBQ get fat off of all the flavorful cuts of meat they put in front of me.",

I ordered al jjigae (fish egg stew), which came as quite a large portion. I enjoyed it along with several banchan dishes and had leftovers to take home.   Pretty decent Korean food. Way better than anything I ever had access to in Richmond, VA, though just on par with California Korean restaurants (but really, it's hard to compare to California for pretty much anything).",

The variety of the menu also did not disappoint the quality of the food.  I also liked the the daeng Jang jjigae.  Although simple,  the fresh taste of the soup helped also with the taste of the meat.  Also the mul naeng myun at the end was so good and refreshing that at first I thought I did not have room for it after plentiful fill of the meat, but I couldn't help but finish it.  Overall my experience from the service to the quality of the food had been completely exceptional.  It is rare to find such service with other AYCE due to dinner being rush hour,  but they were able to provide an excellent service through and through",

Speaking of side dish, where the hell is the fish cake??     I ordered a tofu soup and it tasted like I was eating hot water. Absolutely NO flavor at all.  The BBQ meat also has no flavor, no seasoning at all, and you might as well save yourself $20 and cook it at home for half the price.

    "text": "I am newly introduced to Korean BBQ.  My BFF is obsessed with Korean culture and just recently got me to try it.  To my shock and awe, I actually like it (I'm the pickiest eater ever and eat nothing but chicken fingers & mashed potatoes).  So, with the discovery of Korean BBQ, we, with a group of friends, decided to go to Lee's.    First of all, before you even think about getting the all you can eat BBQ, everyone at the table has to agree to it.  The dinner pricing for AYCE is $29.99, which isn't absolutely terrible but still a lot to pay for one meal/per person.  They really do let you keep it coming.  The food itself wasn't bad at all.  We got pork belly, pork shoulder, bulgogi and a variety of other things and, of course, it comes with the normal spread of traditional Korean eats like kimchi.  What I like about Korean BBQ is that I can cook it myself for as long as I want (I like my meats a little burned - I know, I'm a weirdo.)  Anyway, like I said, the food was good.  However, this place is only getting 3 stars because the service was awful.  Our waitress looked like we were wasting her time.  She really couldn't give two shits about us & the fact that we were all paying $30 each to eat (which is a lot for one meal/per person!!).  We repeatedly asked for drinks that were never delivered.  When she would pass our table, we would say 'excuse me' in English & Korean (we had a few people that could speak a bit of Korean with us) and she completely ignored us until she decided it was time to check on the table.  She got super pissed when we asked for the beer that she never delivered.  & then we sat for probably close to 30 minutes waiting for the check and finally had to ask a different server for it.    As I re-read this whole review, I feel like downgrading a star but I'll leave it at 3 since the food was good.  But man... they really need to get some servers who can at least pretend like they care about the customers.  Next time we want Korean BBQ, we are going to Tofu Hut!",

I'm a local and always wanted to try this place and I finally have, and I won't be returning. I am half Korean, and granted I look Caucasian along with my Caucasian fiance, were clearly treated differently from the other Asian tables around us. Not one smile from the server, no check backs to see if we were ok, no waters or refills on the corn tea (We had to literally stop the server just to ask for waters!!). They placed our check on the table not with a single word before we were even finished, did not return for the remainder of our time to see if we wanted anything else...... which we did, DESSERT!! We needed boxes for our unfinished food but even with eye contact she did not return. I paid up front, asked for a box and water (which I never received, after a fourth time asking) and asked the girl if she was having a bad start to the New Year, she stated \"No.\" And asked why. I mentioned it seemed she wasn't happy and hadn't smiled once at us and all she said was, \"It was busy today\". Gave us a box and out we went.   Never again will I return, take it as a win for you or a loss.... How ever you take it, know this; I work in service industry and I know the power of great service and taking care of guests. They pay your bills, they are free advertising, good or bad. They will continue to come week after week as great service is hard to find. Until your service standard mentality changes to gear towards guests, you will stay mediocre.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try this place ever since my friend told me that the meat quality is really good. She said ever since she had this place, she can't really go to the cheaper places like Tofu Hut. This place closed down for a little bit because of the fire.   I got the chance to go the other day. We ordered beef ribeye, beef brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, pork neck, large intestines, and kalbi. It might be because I don't have refined tastes, but I didn't taste any difference in meat quality. They did have more meat variety than other places usually do. I did like the beef ribeye. It was really flavorful. The saving grace was the kalbi. You are only allowed 2 pieces per person. It did taste amazing. The pieces were huge. We first ordered 6, but the waitress said 3 for now. We were like... uh what, but we'll go with it. We understood once we got them. They were huge pieces. It was delicious, and the meat was so soft and tender. The only downside is that it's sweet. I wish they had a non marinated version. A friend said that at Gen in California has both marinated and non marinated.   This place was decent, but I wouldn't agree that it's worth it for the price. I'd always wanted to try it, so it is good experience.   A perk is that they do have side dishes like soup, steamed egg, and topoki.   Side note, after cooking our meats, the server tried to clean our pan with a napkin, and ended up ruining our cooking area because there was tissue residue. They changed our pans twice which was just unnecessary.  It was nice, but I felt bad that they just kept trying to change the plate. In their side dishes, they included 4 slices of radish, and when we asked for more they only put 4 more. Service was just mediocre.",

We are exhibiting at the Rio Hotel and wanted to grab Korean BBQ so we decided to at here: We were seated right away and our waitress was annoyed that we were asking questions about the menu. We had to ask 3-4 times for our waitress to serve our appetizers. When I asked to order #10 our waitress said with an attitude \"what's #10\" I ordered a chicken soup that tasted HORRIBLE.  It didn't matter how much kimchi I put in the soup it was not good at all. The only thing in the soup was tasteless chicken and broth filled with garlic. Awful food and awful service. DO NOT BOTHER EATING HERE!!",

We had two ladies assisting us at our table, both were very nice, helping, and even made recommendations that were excellent. The only issue I thought of was the pricing. I've been to Korean restaurants in Vegas and Los Angeles who charged less and gave you more choices, shrimp and more chicken variations for example. All in all a good experience and will be back, may have to drop down to a lower tier meat selection as almost $40 for the C plan seemed high, especially if you only enjoy a few of the items in that plan.",

All you can eat 24-hours a day...yes please! We had a great time and they were super helpful and accommodating. Food was terrific and the service was speedy. Just a tip to those not used to Korean places, there is a small doorbell button on your table. Use this whenever you need anything from the staff. If you buzz it they will come running. Sometimes I see people trying hard to flag someone down from across the restaurant. Use the doorbell. It's much more convenient!!  Word of warning: when they say the spicy chicken is spicy...they really mean it! Oh so good and worth the pain! The side dishes were great and plentiful too. Just ask if you want more of anything.",

There are much better Korean BBQ restaurants in Las Vegas and compared to them, Lee's Korean BBQ is not going to catch up anytime soon.   First of all, I believe that their meats were lacking flavor. The quality was also okay but there are a lot of improvements that could be made. The flavor and the quality did not really \"electrify\" my mouth as really good KBBQ should.   In regards to service, I believe that it was good. They are really generous about their portions with meats and other dishes so be prepared and come on an empty stomach. The servers were nice and checked up on us often.   Overall, this restaurant only deserves 3 stars from me but it was worth a try.",

There was only 1 table/2 customers inside at that time. We were seated and given water.. and thats ALL the service we got.   We looked at the menu and decided what we wanted.. We waited for someone to get our orders PATIENTLY. More than 15min pass and still no service. I even saw 2 waitresses look our way and say something in a foreign language(i don't want to assume its Korean just because its a Korean restaurant) to somebody in the kitchen. STILL no <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fservice.My&s=82d24a6484f4851c9b454f8053b6468137d3824d860585714506932f934177a8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">service.My</a> friend actually started to raise her hand to no avail.   Then a large group came in the restaurant - maybe numbering 12 people and i don't want to assume they were Korean just because, but they spoke the same language as the waitress did. They sat them down and gave them water. After this, a waitress finally stood in front of our table with an order slip - like the action of a waitress ready to take our order. I started to tell her my order when this waitress walked away and started talking to the bigger group and SHE STARTED TO TAKE THEIR ORDERS!!!!.... I was like, WTF lady...   I am a very respectfull and patient guy. But this pissed the $!#@ out of me... I stood up and told my friend we were going somewhere else.. on the way out I yelled \"THANK YOU!!!\"...  The only reason I chose to eat at this restaurant is that, the other AYCE k.bbq places had looooonnnggg wait lines.. this place did not. THIS PLACE ALWAYS HAD NO LINE. That is why I like to take my friends here when there are loooonnggg wait lines at other places. I don't mind waiting but I don't like making my friends/companions wait in line.  This place was always my last resort because - over priced menu selection , $30+ for meat selection you can get from $19 - $25 at other AYCE locations. I NEVER come here if I am by myself and there are no looonnngg lines at other restaurants.   For the $h% @$$ servers, I actually would like really thank you, because I found another place that does not have a line on a busy night. And I they are actually cheaper and have better meat selection than your place, so for that, I greatly appreciate your bad service. THANK YOU!!!!!!!",

I absolutely love the variety of meat and was a huge fan of the marinated beef ribeye & sirloin. I was a bit disappointed with the selection of banchan since they were a bit limited but delicious nonetheless.  Service was also pretty good. There was only one server working but that was because there were only 3 or so parties seated. She would come by to check on us and needed anything and she also made us feel welcomed when we walked in.  Overall would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Very very good AYCE Korean...best I have had personally, and I have tried at least 5-6 other spots in town over the years.  I am not a connoisseur by any means, and I am not Korean, but this was the best overall experience and food I have had.   What makes it the best in my eyes?   Freshly prepared everything.  All the side dishes are wonderfully prepared, and everything is included.  We got soups, salads, sides, and everything in between.  Run out of something?  Just ask for it, and you have it within minutes.  Some other places really skimp out on these important staples.  Service...this is the hit or miss at Korean BBQ spots.  Sometimes you are your own chef (hate this way, but it still works), and sometimes you feel like you have your own personal chef table side.  This is the latter!  We had two different ladies checking in on us, ordering our food, refilling our drinks, and most importantly, cooking our food for us!    Meats....also freshly prepared.  Don't expect to be digging out your own food raw buffet style.  That always weirded/grossed me out truthfully.  You want bulgogi?  Ask for it, and it is prepared and brought to your table.  Want more kalbi ribs?  You never get a dirty eye or feel guilty about pigging out.  And the meats are full of flavor!  Try the spicy pork dish and rice cracker dish (it is spelled out completely in Korean)!  Yum!  Lastly, the atmosphere is great.  The location isn't nearly as seedy as a lot of other spots, and the decor inside is very trendy and classy.  The grill tops work very well, and are super quiet fans that do their job well.  Since the food is prepared fresh and everyone is friendly, you feel very welcomed and can fully enjoy your short stay with them.  They have only been open for about a year, and with Mr. Lee's money behind them, you know they will be serving the best quality and selection at the most fair prices, just like their liquor stores.  If you love Korean BBQ, you owe it to yourself to give it a go!",

They serve their gal bi filet style where it's cut from the bone.  Almost all the other serve the other cut of ribs where with 2-3 small bones in each.  The taste and quality of their meats is so much better.  I like how they bring the food to you and help you cook- added service bonus.  The atmosphere is also much nicer and their ventilation is better so you won't be coming out smelling like BBQ as much.  Considering this place has been open a few months and only has 12 reviews, I'm really surprised.  This place is severely underrated and is easily my favorite AYCE BBQ.",

I guess if you aren't Korean the servers & hostess will just look at you then COMPLETELY ignore you. No hi. No how many in your group. NOTHING. I WAITED 8mins to just get acknowledged then another 15 to get a seat. I had to re ask after 15mins of them helping other people. Then I finally got a table, there were several tables open by the way. I also went almost the entire meal without a drink after reminding the waitress 4-5times. I just asked for hot tea. & I had to physically get out of my seat to ask for more sides & my drink for the 5th time. That was the ONLY time the server EVER CAME to the table. HORRIBLE SERVICE. HORRIBLE. I will never come here again & I will make sure everyone knows how bad this place is",

I sat there for 10 minutes before anyone noticed I was there and during the dinning experience I was served by three different staff members not sure what that was about. Our first waitress was not very helpful as she seemed to not want to be there, our second waitress was much better and very attentive our third waiter did not remember who requested what beverage just placed everything on the table. The food was good no complaints there. I am probably not going to come here again or recommend this to anyone, they need to work on a few things before I try this again. Staff needs to work on attitudes, presentation and organization. There was one lady who showed up with a young man, she was definitely not in uniform yet she sat her self down, turned the grill on, went to the back kitchen and got a cart of food and served the young man she came in with and then proceeded to work and eat. Who knows who she was but not good from my perspective.",

After being seated we waited for the waitress to come back to take our order, which was going to be the AYCE. There was no acknowledgement and no one even said a word to us. After 10mins we saw an older Korean lady with her son get seating right next to us. The waitress immediately took her order and brought her and her son soup and a bowl of rice, and still didn't even take our order or even look at us. Mind you we also had our son with us also who was very hungry. After waiting 15-20min for a server to take our order, we just decided to leave. They did not seem to care about the wait time for the existing AYCE tables either. Doesn't seem like they would bring out food in a timely manner if eating AYCE. We will not be coming back here again and would not recommend coming here unless you are an older Korean or Caucasian.",

Usually when you think of korean restaurants you think of generosity.. this is sort of the opposite. After we had eaten our side dishes, the waitress never came by to refill them. For me, that is a big NO-NO. #1 Rule: Keep those side dishes full. You don't even have to ask me if I want them to be refilled, like Nike says \"Just do it\". It was Christmas eve so they were busy, but you would expect the waitresses to be a little bit more attentive... seemed kind of amateurish. The meat was OK. The side dishes were OK. Overall it was just an OK experience. Nothing more, nothing less. If you tried out this place you would understand :/",

Whether if it's just the two of us or if we have friends and family in town, we always come here for the food. The restaurant is clean and big enough to seat large groups comfortably. In addition, the location is perfect with lots of parking in the Greenland supermarket plaza. The prices are reasonable especially for AYCE compared to other kbbq spots which I think are overly priced in my opinion.   Since we have friends visiting in town, we took them here last night for dinner. The service was quick and the waitress was very attentive with refilling our drinks. She also checked on us to see what else we wanted to order on the menu. The choices of meat are good quality and the side dishes of kimchi, daikon, and bean sprouts are delicious. On their AYCE menu, we also love ordering the corn cheese, steamed egg, and topokki (my all-time favorite dish here). We found everything to be delicious and extremely flavorful.   We left the restaurant completely stuffed and our tummies satisfied. We love coming here and will continue to keep coming back. I definitely recommend this place!",

And there are 3 menu options for different tiers of meat.   This is not a super trendy place like a lot of the new korean bbq places in town.

A group of 8 of us came here around 5PM during CES week, January 11th, The place was empty, there was only 2 tables that had guests dining. They sat us down to our table and we waited about 25 minutes waiting for someone to take our order, but when the waitress finally came, instead of taking our order, she told us that we cannot be accommodated because they have a reservation at 6:30!! It was only 5PM and the place was empty! We could have finished before 6:30 anyways. It is horrible that they wasted almost half and hour of our time just to kick us out.   That is ridiculous and unacceptable service!!!!!!!!!!!!!  DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. The servers and hosts are idiots. They do not know what they are doing. They shouldn't have sat us down to begin with!!",

My cup was never half empty and the food was super yummy  I'm picky about kimchi and I just did not like theirs at all because my mom is known for making the worlds greatest kimchi. So I never take ratings down for that.   The meats were fresh the side dishes were tasty and my Nayngmyun was super perfect for my craving I was having for my favorite summer noodle dish (even though it's not summer) paired along with Kal Bi how can you go wrong?   The amount of noodles was generous it was like 17.99 for the Kalbi and the noodles with rice and banchans !   I loved seeing the groups of families and male friends just laughing and eating their all you can eat choices.   Next time we will probably get that option. It was my first time here and I didn't want to go over board.   We also had the bulgogi and the daengjang jigae.   It was really good! Diana and the other servers all take care of each other's tables so well it's amazing how they communicate and of course me being Korean I always love the button for calling the server when necessary.   Though I didn't utilize it   I'd like to try different options next time !",

Walks to our table when we stand up and literally looks everywhere for the TIP mind you my boyfriend didn't want to leave any because of how bad the pressure felt of her checking if the money was on the check already.

I expect no service from Asian restaurant, I'm used to that.  But this place is down right ri-DIC-ulous!  I always leave here mad and pissed off because the servers aggravated me.    -You order your meats in the 1st round and they try to tell you it's too much. And won't take anymore orders.  Even when it's a party of 8.  -They come by and grab the meat off the grill and just distribute it to whoever at the table even when its not even cooked yet.  Then they grab a used napkin from anyone sitting close by and scrapped the black gunk from the grill.  WT!?  -asking for anything it's like pulling teeth!!. We asked 3 separate servers for hot tea, finally got it after about half and hour.   -they limit you two pieces of kalbi per person, which is fine.  But argues with you that you reached your limit and it suddenly changes to one per person when the menu states two pieces per person!  I'm not going to cheat you out of an extra piece of kalbi people...relax!    Only thing I like about this place is that it's 24 hours.  The service and the aggregation I get here is not worth it!  I rather starve!  I seriously want to fight somebody when I dine here. (haha...poor service is one thing, but they seriously piss you off here.)

Our experience sort of ruined a supposed special day for my mom and here's why:   The restaurant is clean, the lighting is bright and the place is very well-decorated but Lee's has the most disappointing prices, grills on the tables and customer service! It was Mother's Day and you'd think they'd be prepared for a huge crowd but I suppose not. We were seated promptly but did not get help for the next 20 or so minutes. We were a party of 8 and it was our first time dining at Lee's. We finally put in our orders and the first batch of food was delicious. The meats were flavorful and spicy.   We were ready for round 2 and when we politely asked the server if we are able to order, she brushed us off rudely saying, \"Hold on! I'm the only server!\" Sheesh, sorry for being an inconvenience! This happened several times during lunch and really rubbed us the wrong way. We asked for food, waters, sides, napkins.. things that are normally asked for but we felt like we shouldn't or couldn't ask for them.   One example is we asked for one more Steamed Egg and Soup and she goes, \"You already have two.\" Yes, we are aware of that. But they're delicious, it's AYCE and there were 8 of us so.. I mean.. we thought we could ask for more. We asked for chicken because she walked away before we could finish our order and she said, \"Finish your meats first then I'll bring it.\"  Honestly, the delicious food does not compensate for the extremely poor customer service.  We had one grill on our table that was located to the very right of the table so the patrons seated on the left had to wait for the cooked meats from the people seated on the right side. The prices are ridiculous for the horrible treatment you get from the workers. The server eventually got nicer at the end when it got less busy and by that time, we were ready to depart already.  All in all, that will be my first and last time at Lee's. I'd rather eat Korean BBQ from somewhere else after my experience.",

I wouldn't recommend Woonam Jung for a group larger than 2 since we found the grill to be too small for a party of 4 (3 of them who consistently eat their dinner like they just got out of prison).   Lots of waiting around to make more space on these small grills and then waiting for it to be done.  I prefer the bigger grills at Honey Pig.    I also didn't like how long it took for the beers to come out.  We had to ask twice for 2 reorders.  It was Hite beer so all they had to do was crack open the bottles and walk them over.  It wasn't like they were slammed the night we were there.    Banchan was substandard and I thought the pork belly was disappointing.  I did enjoy the ribeye, galbi, spicy chicken and spicy pork.  I liked that it was well ventilated so you didn't have to carry around Korean BBQ cologne with you the rest of the evening.  I still prefer other places down the street over this though.",

    "text": "I was down in the China Town area Saturday morning just to check things out.  I was feeling rather hungry and decided it was time for lunch even though it was only around 10:30 AM.  Well, not many places seemed to be open that early.  Not where I was looking at least.  So I headed up Spring Mountain to check out Pho Saigon on Rainbow.  I figured if they were not open I could at least visit the market next door.  Much to my surprise I saw Woonam Jung right there too and it was open.  Well, I had never had real Korean food before so I thought \"what the heck.\"  I may as well give it a try.  So I walked in and found it to be very quiet.  It was still early afterall.  The restaurant was beautiful.  Dark floors.  Dark tables.  Glass panels with a dragon etched in.  Remarkably clean.  I looked at the menu before deciding to actually eat there.  I did not understand much of anything on it as most of it was in Korean and I don't read the language.  The hostess was kind enough to explain some of the menu to me and I took my seat.  I ordered bulgogi since it was really the only thing on the menu that I was familiar with.    It did not take long for my order to come out.  First up were the sides.  There was classic cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, bean sprout salad, broccoli raab, and the big mystery side.  That was some sort of shredded or noodle looking dish.  It was spicy and slightly fishy.  Good though.  More on that later.  The kimchis were both fantastic.  The bean sprouts were fresh and crisp.  The broccoli raab was just okay but I am not a fan of the green when it is cooked.  The bulgogi was great.  The beef was very tender and not at all fatty.  There was a certain sweetness to it that is hard to explain.  In any case, it was delicious.  The steamed sticky rice on the side was good too.  It was sticky enough to eat with chop sticks.  Something I have always struggled to do.  No problems here.    After lunch I went for a walk through the market next door and discovered what I think the mystery side was.  Shredded dried cuddle fish.  That would explain the fishy taste.  It is strange to think I ate that becasue it is not something I am familiar with but it was good and I would likely eat it again if it came as a side again.  I was quite pleased with the food and service and would like to return again.  Maybe a ways down the road though.  The $13 price tag for lunch is higher than what I am used to paying.  When I feel the need for good Korean cuisine, though, I know where to go.",

What is really bad about this is that there were only two sets of customers in the restaurant.  The servers were not hospitable at all. We finally got our food. I again was asking for service, but to no surprise I look over and all the employees were eating. I tried to get there attention and they ignored us again.  I finally stood up and got her attention. She comes over takes the order again. Goes to the kitchen, come out and eats again.  She gets up without washing her hands and brings us our food.  I get on yelp and took a picture of our food; the other server comes over and says what are you doing. I told her I am on yelp. She ten says \"you don't put bad things in there,I give you free drinks\". At that point my wife and I wanted the check.  Mr. Lee I am so disappointed with that kind of service. Training your staff to be more attentive and washing there hand would go a long way. I was so close to asking for our money back. Please train your staff!!!",

Anyways, I'm a cancer patient, and it's hard to determine if I will eat well, so if I have a crave, I head out immediately to fulfill it, regardless of the price. So, I called around, and found this one close and wasn't as expensive as others. The place was nice and clean, there was someone at the door to greet my daughter and myself. They sat us immediately, we ordered, and our food took about 15 minutes, which wasn't long, being that it wasn't crowded. I love the Korean barley house tea they served us. I also love that they serve side dishes, mainly of Kimchi vegetables, red beans, mac salad, and rice. We had the fried Mandoo appetizers, and the chef's special glass noodle dish called Japche. It was delicious! It hit the spot, and gave a good portion too. I loved mostly everything, but the price is too high, especially for items that cost a few dollars in the Asian market. That is why i have to rate it a 4.I now know how to put this dish together, so I will try to make it on my own for less, and if it doesn't turn out right, then I will be back. Service was good, people were friendly and they even said good bye in Korean as we exited. good job guys!",

It's BBQ meat but tastes like it could be braised...what kind of Korean magic trick is this =P I don't think any of the other Korean BBQ establishments serve the short ribs thick cut, all the other places generally have the thinner cut ones similar to the ones at Hawaiian restaurants.  Also they have all the other items like rib eye, marinated beef, pork belly, spicy pork, beef belly, squid, steamed egg, etc.  The only item that is not on the list, that places like Sura have, is shrimp.  This is not one of those establishments where you go and pick your meat, instead you order off a menu and they come to your table and cook the meat for you.  For the price of $25 for AYCE, it's on par with the other restaurants, but the galbi is what will have me coming back here instead of other places.  The banchan is a little limited, only three or four items....and I noticed because I always notice Asian biases...other tables with Korean speaking customers received \"extra\" banchan and maybe a little extra attention while they were there.  But overall, the customer service is still better than some of the other AYCE Korean places, since they did come and flip the meat and cut the pork belly and kalbi into smaller pieces for us.  They also serve an after dinner drink....a sweet cinnamon/ginger/dried persimmon punch with pine nuts...meant to aid in the digestion of the copious amounts of meat inhaled.  This place is owned by Mr. Lee of Lee's liquors....as was made obvious as he sat and enjoyed his dinner and a glass of wine in the corner....Mr. Lee is clearly a very successful businessman...and now he has another money making sensation on his hands.",

We got the three some with the ribs, marinated beef and spicy marinated chicken.  That was enough to feed a family of four.  Restaurant was clean and everything looked pretty new.  My biggest complaint is the service. Once business picked up for dinner, our waitress was gone.  I don't know how many times I had to wave her down or yell to get her attention.  She appeared to be ignoring us every time she walked by.  A couple of times she looked at us like we were bothering her.  Not to accuse this place of racism but she was obviously attending to the Korean diners regularly that came in after us, and not once came by to check on us on her own.  She even gave the check to a couple of tables that asked well after I had asked her three times.  We still didn't get it after 20 minutes.  My wife was pissed off as we walked out.  She got a big laugh when I said I left zero for the tip, since she always complains that I always over tip for bad service.  I will not be recommending this place to anyone, especially friends and family.",

    "text": "You don't know tender until you've stuffed your face with a serving of the marinated galbi at Woonam Jung, and that is my recommendation to you: a face stuffing of marinated galbi at Woonam Jung. I am pretty sure it will cure whatever ails you.   Yes, it is going to cost you more than AYCE options. It will cost you approximately $28 for one order, but you will get a dish that defies culinary logic. This galbi manages to be thick AND tender, which leads me to believe they have a Korean black magic wizard in the back casting tenderizing spells.   However, they should also hire a wizard to work out their service kinks. It is grand opening still, and they were swamped by all the CES businessmen posses. They were out of tea, out of broccoli, and they managed to mess up our order in every way possible, including running one credit card for the entire bill after we gave them three for a split check. We were there for 3-hours! Someone who didn't eat the bewitched galbi would have probably given them 2-stars based on the service alone.  If fish is your friend, you will also be pretty delighted by the seafood combination, which comes with lobster tail, squid, shrimp and salmon. The seafood lovers at my table were drooling on the bountiful sea offerings as they were laid across the grill. It is a good value, although we think we may have been given a double order? (Refer to paragraph 3.)  Banchan were not particularly notable to my dismay.   However, in the end, Mr. Tender Galbi made up for everything. Seriously, I realize it may be a bit more than you want to pay for Korean BBQ, but your pennies will be well spent on this marinated masterpiece. (No need to waste the extra buck on the \"prime,\" unmarinated cousin.)",

    "text": "Being jaded from AYCE Korean BBQ from LA, we are always looking for something here in Vegas to justify not driving to Cali for good Korean BBQ.  So after reading all the other reviews, we decided to give this place a try.  The layout of the place is modern, and has clean looks.  The staff was friendly and the service was good.  They had a variety of banchan and a variety of meats to choose from.  Prices are OK (for Vegas, but you can get an awesome KBBQ AYCE in LA for under $20 like MooDaePo or Road to Seoul)   Based on other KBBQ AYCE in town, I would say this place is pretty good.  But if you are familiar with KBBQ from SoCal, they have to step up their game.  They should add additional dipping sauces as their Bulgogi (Marinated Beef Sirlion) lacked seasoning in comparison to other KBBQ...they should also get \"rice paper\" or radish wraps to their Banchan.  I will say that their Galbi (Marinated Short Ribs) was flavored best and should've started with that choice sooner.  I would return probably return here for some Bibimbap and a sizzling Galbi plate.  Until then, I would still go drive to SoCal for some KBBQ AYCE goodness.",

I didn't try the BBQ on my visit, I was craving Dolsot BibimBop  (Hot clay pot Bibimbop)  When my bowl came out I noticed a few things that caught my attention.  There was a crisp, black leaf on the top of it.  I'm not sure what it was, but I don't think it was edible.  The rice was purple, which I've never seen before.   Once I added the right amount of GochuJang, (Red Pepper Paste) it tasted similar to many other Dolsot Bibimbops I've had in the past.  The best part of this dish is of course the crispy rice at the bottom of the bowl.   I wouldn't rush back here, since there are so many other Korean spots in town, but I'd come back to try the BBQ.",

I've had the waitress with the short- reddish hair before, if you get her don't even bother dining here. We waited at the table for 20 min before she even came over, did not ask for our drink order, took 20 min to bring the meat out (and it wasn't even the right meat!), never came to check on us and every time we needed something she just tossed it on the table like we were do dogs and walked away. Seemed like we where bothering her I guess. I over heard several tables complaining and even see customers having to get up to grab their own water from the pitcher, silverware, etc. Also, I like how they advertise the $19 all you can eat but are forced to get the $26 because they \"don't offer it tonight.\" Save yourself a trip, there are other better bbq places to go now. Food is kind of ok (used to be better), but nothing to make you want to come back.",

It was a bit sticky and had a slightly nutty flavor. I don't know what it's called but I really liked it. Meat portions were good as well as the side dishes.   Was dining with my 2 brothers and boy, can they eat. We had plenty of side dishes and meat: pork, galbi, etc. The three of us got out of there for around $80.

I dont think so, cause they never came back to ask what else the customer want.  Also be ready to grill your meat on burn grill, they refuse to change to the clean one, give u unhappy face when u ask for it. Save ur time and ur belly to another korean ayce,because its not worth it at all. The fastest thing is when u ask the bill and they will give u smile, because they hope to get the tip when u pay.

    "text": "Korean AYCE barbecue is a great way to load up on protein, and Woonam Jung Lee is among the handful of places in Vegas to choose from to do this.   They are located in the Korea Town Plaza, to the right of Greenland Market.   The first thing you notice is how clean this restaurant is. Sparkling clean, almost too clean to believe that AYCE BBQ happens here all day everyday. (Yes, they are open 24 hours.) Its very well lighted and the circulation is a bit better than others.   The current rate (as of 10/4/15) is $32.99/pp for AYCE, and $14.99 for ages 3-8 years. Everyone in your party must do AYCE. It's a little on the higher end price in town. (They do offer a cheaper rate after midnight.)  At Woonam Jung Lee, they serve you everything. This can be good or bad, depending on what your preference is. I prefer smaller portions of the proteins so I can try everything. They give you quite a bit of each kind of meat, which can limit your variety. We tried asking for less, but that didn't really happen.They only have about 7 banchan available and only white rice is given.   Their best item (from the dinner AYCE menu) is the Marinated Beef Short Ribs. As a result, there's a limit of 2 pieces/person. The Pork Belly is good, but then again, pork belly is always good. The Small Octopus is good, but already marinated in that red chili sauce.   Also included are Topokki (rice cake in chili paste sauce), Doenjang Jjigae (soybean soup), and Gyeranjjim (steamed egg).  At the beginning of service, the waitresses were more attentive. But as it got busier, it was harder to request more rice, sesame oil, meats, banchan, etc. (This is one of the reasons I prefer the self service buffet.) They actually do a lot of the cooking for you, too much for us actually since out meat was getting cooked way too fast. If anything, we thought they are a little too pushy at the end trying to serve us. We wanted to slow down and I guess they are used to customers always wanting more.  They automatically give you ice water, but they do have barley tea (iced or hot).  No sikhye (rice dessert drink).   It's been years since we've sat down for Korean AYCE BBQ and we are used to the self service variation. It was nice to be served, but a pain at the same time. I would prefer a little more variety in terms of side dishes too. A decent experience overall, but pricier.",

When we tried to order more side dishes, she didn't feel like doing so so she lied and said side dishes can only be refilled no more than 2 times. Whenever we tried to order more meat, she was too lazy to order so she always gave us a bad face! Seriously, if you want to be a server in a BBQ restaurant, then you should know what you should do as a server. We didn't even try to give you a hard time but just wanted to order more food. They need to rehire and retrain their servers!",

Most people experiencing this are used to the cheery American vibe but, they mustn't forget that they are in Koreatown which provides a different ambience. I enjoyed the food on the numerous occasions I've been here and find their prices to be amazing considering all the things you get. I definitely return due to the food and location. I like being able to go grocery shopping and have lunch or dinner after. It is very convenient.",

We were hungry, so we ate.  The waitress was pushy and annoying cuz she kept coming up and stirring our food... They had to keep changing the grill cuz their exhaust system doesn't work properly.

    "text": "You would think that being one of the most expensive AYCE Korean BBq places in vegas that this place would be top notch but it makes a u turn in almost every way. Service was brutally bad! Not the asian restaurant regular bad, I'm saying these guys are the cab drivers of Korean BBQ service. The food is ok. The burner to cook on is too small. They have this stupid rule that if one person orders AYCE everyone has to order all you can eat. 2 things that really stood out on craptastic service!  1. We came here for a friends birthday and brought the cake early so it was hidden and kept in their fridge. Once everyone was done eating we asked for the cake and asked for the cake and asked for the cake again. 38 minutes later they came over to us and asked if we needed anything, we let them know we would like our cake and got nothing for another 10 min. We finally get the cake and everyone by this point is just wanting to leave so we asked for the checks for everyone and waited so long that we were about to just walk out. Im not over exaggerating the times, it was really that bad! The checks didn't come for another 15 minutes.  2. The lady that came to clean grill was an absolute blast to watch! Instead of taking the Iron burner off an replacing it with a new one she started scrubbing it with a dry napkin that basically shredded apart and feel into the holes which just burned and a bunch of napkin smoke was coming through the vents. The best part was she grabbed our meat and put it on the burner so we now have meat infused with napkin smoke. It was delightful!   I've eaten at a lot of places in the 20 years I've lived in this great city but this place would win for the worst service I have experienced. Over 30 bucks for 6th string service.",

Stranger because I saw her 3 minutes after giving around 6 rices for another table. I just keep watching if she remembered my request n nothing. And also we ordered steamed egg, corn and soy soup , OMG waiting for 20-30 min and I saw her giving for another Korean customers table looks like restaurant owner friends first . And the beef soup n cold noodle was no seasoning . The broth looks like just water some salt . Poor quality and variety of side dishes . Dry corn , soy soup with just water n soy paste ....Terrible! Made my wallet empty without eat well , Don't recommend this place. I was fidelity customer there, but from now never going back . There are lot many Korean BBQ options around there!!!",

The waitress are not so friendly but  still pleasant. They usually start grilling the meat for you and then you are on your own unless your burn the grill then they come and say \"no no no\" lol the little dishes that come with the meat like kimchi, sprouts, papaya salad (spicy hot guys), radish, green salad (dressing is not tasty at all) then they bring you the salt&pepper with the sesame oil et some soy sauce I wish they would bring you some spicy chili oil instead of the soy sauce (better with sushi in my opinion)  The only reason why i didn't put 5 stars is that often you have to ask twice for refill or accompanied dish (like the papaya salad or kimchi or sprouts)...",

I left so upset because of the worst service I've experienced.   This is what happened.   I do not know her name but all I know is she is old Korean lady. We placed an order and my husband asked the server when she comes back next time, if she can bring more salad. She said, \" Well, I'm not coming back!\"  I was like what????? I was very annoyed by her response. So I told her, \"Well, looks like you only serve once and don't come back ever??? What is this?\" She then said, \"well, you want the salad?\". And all of sudden she changed her attitude because she noticed my facial expression. Maybe because she wanted a good amount of tip. No thanks. I barely ate because I lost appetite from her. I almost wanted to argue with her because her attitude was so bad.   About 10 minutes after, next thing you know, she's having a meal at the other table. That tells you right there she doesn't want to be bothered when there is her table assigned to her. I was very upset when I noticed it.   Plus, the beef brisket was soooooooo dry; inedible. It was awful I had a bite and had to throw it away.   People, I warn you, if you want to experiecne the worst customer service come here. Food is not that good either. And to the server; if you don't want to work, don't work on your shift when you try to eat your meal. Just ridiculous!!!!",

The raw meat came with terkiaki chicken, boneless ribs, pork belly and pork. Then the small refillable plates came in, small corn with cheese dish, and tofu soup and sizzling scrambled egg  in pot.  Lots of food and no time to talk or food gets burnt. Just eat as the server just cooks for you at your table and then she makes her round to other tables!   Great we came here on not busy night. I don't want to imagine what a full house will look like and probably why other Yelpers complain of bad service. Tonight what we order quality of meats were good and I felt like a queen having my food cooked for me. \"oh Yummy all in my tummy,\" is my slogan! LOL    If I come back to Vegas, I definitely will rent a car and drive here for it's really worth your money and not crowded on a Tuesday night!

At first, yeah, I didn't want to push it bec it seems rude right? But it's there for a reason and it's seriously the future. I've seen these service buttons in restaurants in Asia; and I remember thinking \"this is genius! So much more efficient\" and if you die of thirst or hunger bec your server didn't come to you, it's your own plain fault. Instead of EXPECTING your server to read your mind or read your table, you can just let them know you would like some more water. I should add that I rarely have to use the button bec the service is on point most of the time. But to those with empty glasses waiting to write a bad yelp review bec of said glass, just press the button.  Anyway, let's talk food. Me and my fiance love the brisket. We order mountains of it. We also order pork belly, short ribs, bulgogi, and spicy chicken. It's good quality meat y'all. Anyone who says it's poor quality... let me give you the side-eye, half cackle, catch you on your boosh** look bec it's ayce freaking kbbq, what are you guys really expecting? If I were looking for premium cut aged 120 days type of meat, I'd visit one of the many top steakhouses Las Vegas has to offer. But no! I want mountains of fatty brisket dipped in oil and salt with mouthfuls of rice ok! Next, they have banchan ofc - kimchi, radish, bean sprouts, salad, fish cake, the works. Love em all. Also, they recently changed their ayce menu so there's more dishes to offer. My fiance and I love the new addition of kimchi soup, bimbimbap, and dessert.   Even though there are many ayce kbbq spots, we find that Lee's really hits the spot for us. Every. Time. As for the prices, there used to be 3 ayce options but I think they've changed it to 2. But anyway, cheaper price = less meat selection. Simple. Any option you pick, it's 100% worth ittttt.",

The time limit to stay is 90 mins. If you have a group of 5+ that really rushes you.  They cook everything for you but if they are busy they have to tend other tables. Meaning you may have to wait or cook yourself (they tell you not to). However, we went at a quiet time and she cooked super fast.",

From waitresses simply ignoring my table, to me having to chase one down to take my order-it was absolutely dreadful. It didn't matter what time of night, MOST waitresses made it seem like a chore/problem to ask for something as simple as more napkins.   After taking a small break (2+ years), returning yesterday was one of the best decisions. Julie, our waitress was such a breath of fresh air since I walked in already expecting to be ignored. Constantly checking on the table, helping out with some of the cooking, and just overall being friendly and making us feel WELCOME. I'm glad to know they have at least one friendly waitress now who knows how to do her job well. I'll be returning again given Julie's outstanding service!",

She said everywhere else in town would be packed. When we arrived, there wasn't a wait - awesome!!! We were immediately seated and they took our orders for drinks, brought us a menu and the sides. The sides weren't what I'm used to when I order Korean food back home (NY or TX) but they were pretty good.   The way it works is...they will bring out a stone grill to your table. You select the type of meat you would like, then the servers will cut it and place it on the grill.  You get to watch your meat cook before you. Once it's ready, you would pick it off the stone grill, while the meat is hot and fresh. We ordered Kalbi and the bulgogi. They were absolutely delicious!   Service was pretty good. The owners came to greet us because they knew my cousin in law. The servers were prompted and were attentive. The next time I'm back in Las Vegas, I would definitely come back here for dinner!",

We did have to flag our server down a couple of times for refills but never to order the meat. She paid attention to how fast we were eating our meat which was great.   Some people might prefer to cut their own meat while cooking but that just helps us out when the server does it for us.   This is definitely our AYCE KBBQ place when we come to Las Vegas.

Mind you we were there first for about 15 minutes before getting our appetizers, but it took less than 10 minutes for the white couple to get their entire full course meal. So if you are black, please do not go to this esblishment. These people are super bias and they discriminate against black people.

I really enjoyed their salad so much flavor and just a little spicy. So for the meats we ordered pork belly, brisket, and beef tongue. I loved the beef tongue it is so good and nice texture. The pork belly was a hit as well I think we ordered three plates by the time we were done. Everyone has ordered the steamed egg thing except I don't care for it but my group said it was delicious.

    "text": "Generous portion, flavorful food, first rate ventilation equipment over the tabletop BBQ grill, newest addition to the Korean restaurant scene in Las Vegas. Owned by one of the nicest and very successful local business owner.  Anyway, after watching a great Saints vs. Lions game, I decided I was going to drop by for some pho (saw Lily's quick tip), but saw the grand opening banner for Woonam Jung. (Opened since Thursday, January 5, 2012)  Wow, what a pleasant surprise after some many years!  So I had to come check it out, even though I am not that hungry.  The hostess showed me to a table in the front of the restaurant.  And I was greeted by probably all of the wait staff, or at least three of them, a few minutes apart ready to take my order (in Korean).  I tried a Galbi stew the last time I ate at a Korean restaurant, so I picked something similar to try here.  The Ugeoji Galbitang (Beef Rib Stew w/ Dried Cabbage) was flavorful and not too spicy.  The portion is large, easily sharable with 2 or more friends.  And it was served with steam rice mixed with some purple rice.  While I was having my dinner, the owner spoke to my after he was done with a business meeting with a member of the local Chinese newspaper.  I learned that besides the newly opened Woonam Jung Korean Cuisine restaurant, he also owns the Koreantown Plaza, the food courts in Greenland Market, Lee's Travel Agency, as well as, (and you can probably guess if I ask you what other business) Lee's Discount Liquor.  Mr. Hae Un Lee, is a first class and all around nice and engaging man, who told me a brief history of how he came to Las Vegas 33 years ago; opened his first Lee's Discount Liquor store 30 years ago and grew it into the massive business empire it is today.  The conversation is like a big cherry to top dessert treat for me.  Anyway, I will be back to try the Korean BBQ part of the menu in the next few days.    --Update--  Came back for the Korean BBQ. Our group went with the seafood combination, which consisted of lobster tails, giant shrimps, calamari, and scallops.  If it is indeed 1 portion worth, instead of the 2x portion that we suspected it to be, then it is well worth it.  The non-prime marinated Galbi was delicious.  The most tender piece of galbi I have ever had the pleasure of eating, and it is thicker than what is typically served at other restaurants or what you can buy from Korean markets.    Service was not as great as my first visit, but they were not slammed by the crowd of CES attendees using up their per diem.  Plus they were just wrapping up their first week of grand opening.  But I will still be back for more of the Galbi and seafood combination.  Service:  4.5/5  Very attentive. If you are Asian, you will likely be mistaken for Korean.  But their English is fairly good, so if your Korean conversation skills is nil, you will still get great service.  Food:  4.5/5  Definitely going up against the other well-established local Korean restaurants.  The food was tasty and the default spiciness level is very mild, and can be dialed up as requested.  Decor/Ambiance:  4.5/5.  Well lit, tastefully decorated.  Parking:  5/5  There are a lot of spaces on the side of Koreatown Plaza where Woonam Jung is located (between Pho Saigon and Tiffany's Coffee).  I really like this place!",

They will pretend not to see you when you try to call them multiple times and walk right past you. This leads into #3 ...  3) The servers will do their best to deny you meat refills. They will take as long as possible to bring your order to save money. Slow service means they lose less meat and less money so they'll snail it as much as possible. Expect 30-45 minute waits per plate.  Finally, and most importantly ...  4). The waitress poured STEAMING HOT WATER ON MY MOTHER'S HAND. A flippant \"sorry\" and they were gone.  If the above sounds like an enjoyable time and a great way to spend your hard earned money then by all means, come to Woonam Jung, where you will be ignored, ripped off, and doused with boiling water.",

    "text": "I have always been avoiding this place due to the prices.. Also the outside didn't look like it would be nice inside. But I was all wrong! The wait @ Hwaro was way too long. So my mom and I decided to go to Lee's instead, because there is rarely a wait at this place.  First off, yeah you can go to Hwaro or Tofu Hut or Sura for their \"good prices\" for a late night KBBQ craving. BUT let me teeeeell you. Lee's has such good quality meats and banchan! The beef brisket was just.. Amazing lol. The beef tongue was great as well. Unlike other places I have tried that left a bitter taste.   The one star taken off is for the service. 3/4 of them were on a break halfway through our meal. And took a couple times to ask where our sides are or to change our grill.  Other than that, this honestly just topped off any other KBBQ place I've been to. They may not have much choices on the ayce menu, but (again) this place has great quality meat and the banchan they have are delicious! (They aren't greedy with the banchan, very generous; I LOVE IT!) :-)",

I had a less than ideal experience last time with a rude server but the restaurant manager was nice enough to respond and tell me they are working on hiring some more professional staff.   The experience this time around was great, they were able to take a last minute reservation for our party of 6 and got us a great big table. The waitresses did appear to be new (I've never seen them before) but they were experienced knew what they were doing. They were very polite and attentive. They also would come by time to time and help us cut up the meat on the grill to help speed up cooking.   All the meats and side dishes were great, it was a wonderful meal. The meat quality here has always been great. They've simplified their AYCE menu to a single page now. It's much easier to read but for you first timers, there's no pictures - so know what you're ordering because the portions are generous.   All in all, a great experience and I'm glad that I got to see an actual positive change in service staff. They however told me that they no longer honor the free soda with Yelp check in. Just FYI. They should probably take it off Yelp!",

Mind you, everything we ordered was included in menu B (which was NOT handed to us or explained.)   We had 5 people in our party, but 2 of them were sitting out and decided not to get anything, yet they still charged for gratuity?! We paid anyways not realizing THEIR scam.  When we realized why the bill was so expensive, we mentioned to the manager that we were given the more expensive menu, when we only ordered what was on the less expensive menu and that we wanted a partial refund for their 'misunderstanding'  She basically shrugged and said \"sorry\" without even giving our waitress any slack. Horrible management.  This is one of the most mediocre, shady places I've ever been to and would not recommend it to anyone. You can find much better KBBQ at an even cheaper price.

The menu had three options and we just chose menu C, $20 a person. We really didn't want to cook any chicken so that's why we didn't choose menu B.  I forgot why we didn't choose menu A.  In any case, they asked us for our drink order. Once they came with our drinks, they were quick to take our order. You can choose up to four is the appetizers. We chose the cheese corn, bean paste stew, steamed egg and papaya salad. The cheese corn and bean paste stew were pretty standard. The steamed egg had great flavor and not salty at all. The papaya salad packed a punch!  It had the right amount of heat but I think some people would think it's too spicy. The banchan has several kimchi options. Compared to the papaya salad, they were very mild in flavor. The potato salad was okay.  The pickled radish was good. The side salad was excellent when you eat it with your meat. I don't remember the other sides, I guess they weren't that memorable.   Now onto the meats!  We ordered the brisket and the bulgogi. They were standard. Bulgogi was marinated well.  We also ordered the marinated spicy pork and that was really good. Not too spicy and not salty. It also wasn't fatty, so we enjoyed it. But hands down we really enjoyed the pork belly. It was thick and so when you cook it, you can cook it up really crispy. We did ask for some ssamjang (sorry if I spelled it wrong), to dip our pork belly in. Oh and they give you rice too.  Overall we would come back here again. The prices were just right and portions were on point.   Oh and I must say, they were very attentive. The servers were really nice and very efficient. When water was low, they filled it. When meat was gone, they ask if you want more. In addition, if the heat was too high, they would adjust it. Oh and we didn't even have to ask them to change the grill, they went ahead and did it. I tell you, we really liked this place and would definitely come back.",

    "text": "$44 per person with tax and everything. Everything was nice and the person serving us was awesome! However, quality of food must be a lot better if it's for such a high price. I was shocked the 6 people cost $250+. It does however offer appetizers and dessert with it. I didn't see any prices anywhere but I assumed the most we were going to pay for kbbq is $30/person with tax included. I like that it is 24/7 and I noticed two guys are eating alone separately which surprised me because I thought the minimum guest per table was 2 people. Overall though, we were hungry and the food sufficed. I got a free drink from checking in on yelp!",

    "text": "I'll make this short and simple....went for lunch for buffet c $20 a head. Server never seated me, had me stand to tell her which meal I was getting. Sat me, said quickly what do u want? I told her which ones and then I wasn't sure if rice was a option cuz it's no where on their menu. Obviously they should have it cuz we're Asian but she could tell me yes or no. Then the food came, server put the cooking plate on top and turned on the heat. Threw all the frozen brisket on a cold ass cooking plate. I'm sorry but I like my meats seared quickly and still red. So I take half of the meat off and put it back on the serving plate. Obviously that meat sucked ass cuz it had no sear. Then the server tried to come back around and throw all my bugogi on the cold ass pan again. I had to stop her to tell her it's not hot enough. Then I had my first reorder....a lot better cuz the plate was hot. That was the end. No one came back, I kept trying to get their attention, but screw it. Apparently what I noticed was that this place was full of Koreans and I'm pretty sure the owner from the lee's tv commercials was there having lunch and all the workers attention was to his discretion. So if you're Korean you're good here, food is at best mediocre, I have had better for cheaper all over LV. This place is dirty, they have no customer service skills, a door bell means lazy in my head especially when you can't tell who has pressed the doorbell, expensive compared to what even Gen can provide, lastly a little racist in my opinion. I think that's the on going trend I keep reading here, until yelp removes it.   Here's my two cents......f*** this place, go somewhere else cheaper, you'll get the same quality of food and same service but you won't have to feel ripped off after you have paid the bill.",

    "text": "So me and two other friends went there for lunch today.  I ordered one of their lunch specials (soon du bu and Garbi combo), my friends ordered Mandu soup and Yook Ge Jang Stew. My reasons for giving them only 3 stars is because 1) they didn't ask me how spicy I wanted my soon du bu stew and even if they are not a tofu specialty restaurant, they should still ask me), 2) their banchan (the multiple side dishes that accompany your main dish) included a potato salad!  Really??? A potato salad?  Since when was this a Korean banchan dish???  This is purely a \"filler!\"  I don't know why they do this but this is NOT the first Korean restaurant I've encountered where they serve non-Korean banchan.  Perhaps they are trying to cater to non-Koreans?  Not sure but it's not proper, not appreciated and certainly not welcomed by any Korean!  If need be, drop the non-Korean banchan and fill it with cheap banchan.  At least it'll be Korean.  We ARE visiting a Korean restaurant, after all!  I forgot to ask for brown rice, instead of white rice and it took the \"owner\" FOREVER to bring the brown rice to me.  I couldn't really start to eat until I got my rice because food tends to be spicy and you need your rice to offset the spice.  Also, their service also seemed a bit on the slow side, especially if you were Asian.  For some reason, the tables that had non-Asians (like Caucasians) seemed to get served faster and friendlier.  So, in the end, next time I am in town, I will not be looking to frequent this restaurant as my first, or even my second, choice.",

But worst part about this experience that made me really disgusted is that.. THEIR FLOOR WAS EXTREMELY DIRTY AND STICKY.. We walked in the restaurant thinking that it was a little sticky. We got a table all the way at the end by the TV.. My flip flops got STUCK on the floor.. I pulled it off and well guess what... Part of their plastic flooring came off with my flip flops.. And it kept coming off every time I set my feet down.. So I ended up putting my feet up to the chairs.. And somehow I needed to take off the plastic flooring off my flip flops so I picked it off with my hands.. And the stickiness got all over my nails and now I ruined a perfectly good manicure.. THIS PLACE GIVES ME THE CREEPS!! I will not go back ANYMORE not unless someone puts a gun to my head... ridiculous.. Dirty floor = dirty restaurant.. Health inspector is needed in this place ...",

Immediately I noticed how clean the restaurant is, and how delicious the food cooking at other tables smelled. Once we ordered the all you can eat, two ladies brought out a huge plate of beef briscut and thinly sliced beef tongue, as well as so many side dishes, salads, and appetizers! Our tables were full! The salad with the ginger and apples dressing is yummy, with a little spicy kick.  The seasoned cucumbers were one of my favorites, along with the miso soup.  The miso paste/sauce is my fav, and the meat tasted great! So tender, and juicy, and the meat plates kept coming! Im thankful I had my Korean friend with us to explain dishes and order, but the waitresses were nice and spoke english.  The best meat was the thin marinated beef!! A must try!!!!!!! I will be back here once a month!",

Anyways the restaurant is very clean and professional. Their menu consist of korean bbq, shabu shabu, and traditional korean foods. I ordered the shabu shabu which is 15$ but you must have 2 orders so it's pretty much 30$. The food was very fresh filled with vegetables, tofu, and mushrooms. Along with the meat of course. The waiter/waitress will Volunteer to help you cook the food if you are unfamiliar. The hotpot at first seems like it won't fill you, but in the end shared with two ppl is more than enough. After you've finished your hotpot they will actually prepare a fried rice like dish with two eggs, seasonings, and purple rice(which seems to be their standard rice). I definitely come back if this cold weather ever gets to me again. Also seeing Lee popping wines while entertaining his guest was a bonus.",

Yeah, probably didn't wait more than a few minutes each round, but I rather have just gotten up and grabbed my own grub. I gave 4 stars instead of five because of having to wait and for the price, but quality of the food was 5 stars.

There were three of us dining (three African American women that is).  We ordered over 80.00 dollars worth of food.   You see we love Korean food and we know some Korean etiquette.  The food very expensive for small portions and side dishes were mostly items you find at an American all you can eat buffet (ex: macaroni salad, broccoli salad).  We ordered spicy rice cakes and there were about 6 rice cakes in the bowl for 7 dollars.   We also ordered pork belly, which typically in most Korean restaurants comes with lettuce for making wraps but no you had about 10 pieces of pork belly over a bed of onion and lettuce cost extra on top of the price of $22.00 for the pork belly.  Insane.  The veggies to put in the wrap consisted of huge pieces of garlic, which is typical for wrap feelings and then they gave us jalapenos.  That was it.   Towards the end of the meal the waitress was missing.   We looked up and she was at a table with other friends or employees eating food and had forgotten about us.  We waited for 20 min because we needed a to go box for the japchae noodles my daughter didn't finish.  I finally got feed up and went to the counter.   When they saw me leaving I noticed another waitress standing at a customers table drinking sojo.  I was shocked.   Even if it is considered a kind gesture to be offered a drink when u are working it's like being inebriated on the job.  She comes to the counter rings me out and the asks for a tip. When she wasn't our server and after we just sat there waiting for a good 20.... WTH(eck)!!!!.... So. Me being a kind women looked on the receipt for a place to leave a tip and no place so I says to her do u have change and I handed her a twenty ... She purposely handed me two 10 dollar bills as though she couldn't break it into smaller bills and so that I would have no choice but to leave a $10 tip.... The lady was an old ajiummah who was trying to take advantage of a customer.   How rude and very racist.  I traveled her all the way from the AZ and from KY before that and never was treated so rudely ...will not go back and don't recommend",

On lunch time since we were already hungry we saw Woonam Jung next to the korean grocery on spring mountain, so we decided to try the place the price for their eat all you can is pretty decent. As far as the meats were concerned they were great the place is getting busier so they will be missing on some of the service, there were only 2 servers out of X tables. Their Tofu with Kim chi was great. The whole dining experiance was great since the eat all you can had a mix of both vegetables and Meats.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality.  We ordered beef tongue, pork belly, and short ribs.  The side dishes were good and I enjoyed the salad.  Now for the service.  For our first order, we asked for a little of each of our selection, so we could see which one we preferred.  The waitress nodded knowingly, and even said, \"yes, a little.\"  A few minutes later she came out with a huge plate of meat.  Perhaps we are the atypical customer who doesn't want to stuff themselves right off the bat.  This happened several more times.  The waitresses are polite, which made them more endearing and amusing rather than irritating.  Overall a solid choice to satisfy a K-BBQ craving.",

We figured out what to do, it was a good learning experience.  Service seemed really good and prompt. What ever we asked for I or my wife got promptly. Only the necessities were suggested and asked when seated (I don't like being asked every five minutes \"how is everything?, can I get you something else?\" mostly when my mouth is full of grindage.) Food to fry had good color,  presentation and flavor.  Korean beer was good too. Prices seemed normal to the cost of living.  Got to meet the owner Lee and a photo with the man him self, he also is the owner of all the Lee's Discount Liquor stores here in Las Vegas and surrounding areas.  Over all a fun experience, I will go back, tell some friends, and I recommend it. I do caution you that you will come out smelling just like a Korean BBQ.  So, to my dog I must have smelled delicious!",

Bad - service was really lacking.  Second time we came here, there were only two other occupied tables but the service was still really slow.  Weird - first time we came here, we saw Mr. Lee (the discount liquor stores chain owner) sitting in his SUV parked just outside counting something.  Second time, we saw Kenny Lee (Mr. Lee's son) dropping by and chatting with the owner for two minutes before leaving.  Do they own this place or just collecting protection $?  JK haha",

I ended up ordering combo platter A for myself $39.99. I know seems expensive and alot of food for one person, but I figured that all I could need eat I would take home.  The food was ok, I love the sides and ate all of them before I left. My only concern is that I was not offered all you can eat.  Can someone please tell me if this place really does have it and if it is on the menu?  Please respond so it might help people in the future.  I do feel a little ripped off if they do offer it, but did not offer it to me. Thanks, Josh",

    "text": "I must say that every time I crave Korean BBQ, I go to Woonam Jung but I'm not always completely satisfied, because of the food but mainly because of the service.   I believe they brought out 5 different kinds of side dishes but I didn't really enjoy any of them besides the cabbage salad. Most of the time, I don't even touch them and only enjoy the bean sprouts with my meat.  As far as the quality of meat goes, the brisket is always pretty much consistent across the board with most restaurants so no complaints there. The pork belly is very thick and my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. The steak is also thick and juicy. However, I ordered the bulgogi and it had a funky smell to it and was very dry and sweet. I don't think that I'll be ordering that if there is a next time.   The biggest downfall for me is the service. Most of the time, I get done with all of the meat on the platter and often find myself sitting there for up to 15 minutes, waiting for a waitress to come by so I can get her attention to order more food. Also, I don't know if it's because I am Korean and always come here to eat with my Caucasian boyfriend but they often \"forget\" to give us certain items such as the sauce for the brisket unless asked. This is a pattern I have noticed (and have been told to do when I worked at a Korean BBQ restaurant) with other Korean BBQ restaurants.   For the price, I think that the lunch prices are reasonable but the dinner price is a little too expensive for me to eat BBQ on a regular basis. Cumulatively, for the food and the price, Woonam Jung will do for now but hopefully I can find a better Korean BBQ restaurant soon.",

Their food is definitely better - they brought in someone new. Their spicy rice cakes are good, and the grilled meats are all good. The service is better than most Asian restaurants -- but it's great that it is clean. Their lunch special is OK for the grill - you don't get any Kalbi or bulgogi, but for dinner you do and it's a great deal. They don't bring the hot pot white rice like they do at DJK, but I'm willing to go to Woonam Jung since it's closer to Summerlin, and it's pretty decent now.",

While we were eating our food we wanted to take a picture and kindly asked her if she could take a picture for us. But she said she was busy and left the table. That made us feel very uncomfortable there. We were having the unlimited bbq for 32$. This was the most expensive deal.

Although, they raised their AYCE KBBQ lunch to $19.99 and AYCE KBBQ dinner to $29.99 after the fire. $3 more for lunch and $5 more for dinner. Perhaps to recoup their losses from the fire? Also worth mentioning is they now have a limit of two pieces of galbi per person. That didn't sit well with me since I can eat a lot of galbi. Two pieces is a child's portion in my eyes!  Coming from L.A., it kills me to pay this when I know I can get more BBQ selections, duk bo saam (rice wrappers), or moossammari (pickled radish wrappers) at a lower price! The meat is good quality though so I guess you get what you pay for. Also, it's Vegas. The KBBQ places in town seem to be higher than what I'm used to.   Along with your meats, you can order the usual things that come with KBBQ. Their daengjang chigae (fermented soybean paste stew) is delicious. Don't forget the steamed egg. They include dukboki (spicy rice cakes) so that's a bonus. I enjoyed their banchan too.  The service is slow to start but once they started, they got us everything we needed. Two of the servers never smile but they did their job by bringing us more meats and dishes and asking if we needed anything else a few times. The owner (at least I think she is the owner) came by to check up on us and smiled so that was nice. I remember her checking up on us on a previous visit and the servers just doing their job with the same demeanor.  The place is clean and modern. It is well-ventilated so I didn't have a strong eau de KBBQ on me afterward.",

Certainly LOTS to eat but what made it so pleasurable  was that the gals really made sure we were eating the bbq the right way... grilling the kimchi. .adding it to the beef with the thinnest pickled radish.. eating it like a Korean taco. With the pork belly... the fat of the belly tamed the spicyness of the kimchi or pickled papaya. Pure delight!",

My group was mostly white and we noticed that the Asian people were served much more promptly. They didn't refill our waters either. I have honestly never experienced this poor of service at any restaurant, fast food included. The starting price for a dinner, the cheapest option, is $20. For the price the service is a joke.   I called and told the restaurant about my experience. They made no offer to refund me or make this right. A lady said they would call a meeting to improve the service here but based on the other reviews and from talking to my local friends here this poor service has been going on for a long time. I want to like this restaurant and if they could address this service issue they'd have a great operation, because the food is great. Vegas has many options for KBBQ. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Lee's.",

I think it's just rude the way she handled this. and I didn't see the male manager today. maybe that's why she's acting so rude. when mr lee around the last time I came last month they all \"very\" nice . they didn't even come to the table often to help cook the meat and their restaurant not even full .",

Several of the appetizer items and a few of the meats that were supposed to be included in the meal were not available, yet there was no concession on the price. And on top of that the service was horrible. The waitress was downright rude, hardly came by to refill our drinks or allow us to order more food, and seemed annoyed when we actually were able to flag her down and request something. Both of the tables to the right and left of us said they couldn't get the waitress' attention. Customers were getting their own water, napkins, etc from other tables because no one was helping them. Save your money - the food and service were not worth the price. We felt ripped off.",

Our first server struggled to communicate in English and was running around like crazy as she seemed to be the only one working. Later on, another server came out and she spoke better English and had a better attitude.  The food itself - We did AYCE. The price is currently $32.99 which is a little steep, but the quality of meat was pretty good. We had the short ribs and a cut of beef (I've forgotten which) that was tasty. We also had the spicy squid, which was not very spicy and lacked a little in quality, IMO. Not too bad, not too good.  The steamed egg and bean paste soup were very good! The accouterments that came with were varied, but mostly nothing to get excited about. I did like their kimchi, my Asian lady friend deemed it \"not funky enough\".  My girl and I both did AYCE and split a large beer and our bill came out to $82. With tip it was scratching $100. I will say we left stuffed. Was it a good meal? Yes! Was it $100 good? Not really.  P.S. I generally have a perfectly strong stomach, but I experienced some pretty intense intestinal discomfort for about 12 hours after eating here. Not sure what gives on that account. I was literally waking up in the middle of the night from gas pain.  So-so service, overpriced, and belly ache afterwards gets it 3 stars. Probably won't return due to the high cost.",

    "text": "At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring.   For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan.   Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat.   While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.  AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.",

I also love how the servers here actually acknowledge you when you walk through the door and it's normally not busy at this time so you get seated right away. Food takes a bit to cook if you order the soups, but if you order all you can eat they have quite a variety of Meats and their meat quality is DEFINITELY better than honey pigs guaranteed. You can also get appetizers whichever appetizers you want so there's quite a variety of stuff to choose from and I love VARIETY LOL. This place is very clean, the floor looks spotless every time I come here to eat, and their bathrooms are as well HELLA CLEAN!! I love it, I love eating at clean restaurants, it makes the whole meal more enjoyable if anyone else feels me on this?? Anyways 5 stars for perfect customer service, cleanliness, variety of quality food AND open 24/7. I'd recommend for everyone to go here seriously especially if you're a night owl and always crave for late night food",

The last time I went to Honey Pig left a lot to be desired and I wasn't sure I'd get kbbq again in Las Vegas.  I took my friend here for her b-day and everything was great! Our server was super friendly and attentive.  She ran around pretty crazy because a table of at least 20 people walked in, but she never forgot about us and her 2 other tables. She mostly cooked all of our food for us, with me just cutting things here and there, and she refilled our drinks promptly. She also brought our glasses of wine as soon as we ordered them. I really was expecting the worst because of everyone else's reviews so I was super happy that we received such great service (a party of one white girl and one very non-korean asian girl).   The meats are great quality, and I will definitely say one order of kalbi per person is definitely enough. We actually only ordered one, because there were other things we wanted as well and were way too stuffed. It IS the most delicious meat on the menu, I'll say. The marinade is very subtle and does not overpower the taste of the meat, which is so tender and delicious.",

AYCE C - $32.99 (Children age 3-8 $14.99) - Includes Beef Rib Eye, Marinated Beef Short Ribs (2pcs/person ONLY), Marinated Boneless Beef, Beef Tongue, Beef Belly, Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, Pork Shoulder Butt, Pork Neck, Small Octopus, Marinated Beef Sirloin, Spicy Boneless Sliced Pork, Marinated Boneless Chicken, Large Intestine, Topokki, Doenjang Jjigae, Gyeranjiim  ------------------------------  To be honest, i took those by reference from pictures here. I do remember it had the A, B, and C option for dinner. Not sure if it is available for lunch. But of course, pick C for our dinner of 4 with 2 being friends from Hong Kong.  Quality of meats and selection made them super happy. Beef rib eye grills up nicely.  Beef Short ribs is a long piece of meat with a huge bone you can lop off (you'd have to anyway since the entire thing, length wise, is longer than the grill. Too bad no un-marinated option available and its limited 2 per person. But still pretty good.   Beef brisket and beef tongue were nice and thin, cooks up quite nicely and fast (for the hungry hehe).   Pork neck, quite different from the usual pork neck i am used to. Its a square piece of meat without its usual layer of \"fat\" youd see in a usual pork neck meat piece. Texture wise, its quite different as well. Not too sure if this pork neck is the same pork neck im used to.   Gyeranjiim is the steamed egg some may know about thats avail at like Tofu Hut, DJK, etc. Yummy :P   Service is decent. Not many workers in the restaurant so may take a while at times.   Overall, this isnt the first time ive been here. First time was much cheaper (pre-renovation) but prices gradually went up since. Quality is there at least.",

Today we did the dinner B which was only 19.99 and for the first time I tried their chicken and bulgogi (and it was delicious) we normally have just the brisket and pork belly, but we decided to venture a little bit today.   We are always at Lee's we have been here numerous amounts of times especially when our friends from Reno come back into town. This is our go to Korean BBQ place and we love it!",

    "text": "99% of the time, I wouldn't trust yelp reviews (I know, I'm a hypocrite). I'm of the opinion that businesses pay other people to write amazing reviews for their company. Or, someone broke up with a waitress and is using yelp as warfare. However, I may be making a bold statement here, but my guess is that the old, old lady serving us probably doesn't have that many exes anymore who are hooked into yelp. She doesn't move fast enough to rack up the numbers. So, all the bad reviews you're reading on this restaurant...probably True.   We came here because...Hello! It's Vegas! We needed a nice place outside of our typical Pho Kim Long late night eats. Everyone was feeling KBBQ so we decided to find a place that serves late at night. Our recently arrived guests flew in at 12AM.  I have to give it to her...our waitress tried to make us happy. No, wait, no she didn't. There were two tables at this hour and our service still sucked. She was probably sitting in the kitchen watching her Korean dramas while our grill turned darker than the color of her face when we asked her to change the grill. We would have flagged her down...but she was no where to be found.   Oh, and you have to love all the hidden rules they like to submit you to. For example, they have (boneless) beef short ribs (Does that even qualify to be ribs anymore???) for one menu (the $26 menu) but you're only allowed 3 orders of it. If you pay th $32 dollar menu, you only get one serving of the bone-in short ribs. Why would I pay an extra 6 bucks just for one serving at an place that calls itself AYCE??? And the banchan sucked. Don't hold out hope that they'll refill it any time soon.  We had a large group so the ONE waitress they had placed us at a table that had only one grill. To make up for it, they gave us a portable stove and placed a grill on top of it. Needless to say, halfway through our meal, the stove stopped being warm and the waitress refused to replace it saying it still has a flame. We had to cook the rest of their food on our grill because no one wanted to die of food poisoning.  This place was overpriced for the quality and amount of food we were given. Never again!",

    "text": "Update:  8/9/16: Went here two weekends ago.  It was 2am and as Jessie K promised, I was allowed to BBQ at the table by myself, as they have removed the \"2 to AYCE BBQ\" rule that seems to be gaining momentum at various KBBQ joints in Vegas.  Started with the Brisket and LA Kalbi.  Hard to mess up Brisket, and they had it nice and thin, and I love the LA Kalbi cut because the meat is thinner when you have it rolling off the bone; and this one didn't disappoint.  I also had the Teriyaki Chicken BBQ.  I wanted Dak Gui, but you only had two choices:  Teryaki and Hot Marinade.  Maybe I should have chose the latter.  I didn't want Teriyaki seasoning, but the Chicken was just flat.  Ordered another Brisket, and Pork Belly (that was excellent) to get that bad taste out of my palette.  The banchai was limited.  No pickled cucumbers, no potatoes in any form, and (although it's a luxury and not a staple) no anchiovis; but they did bring my a second bowl of kimchi after I used up the first.  You get a choice of sides, so I chose the egg hot pot, and Haejangguk that came out really good:  soft tofu and crisp cucumbers, making me fret even more that I didn't have cucumbers in my banchai.    I asked for Bibim Bap Sauce...should I have said Gochujang instead?  Because on both occasions (I poured the first one into another dish and had it bussed), I got something that was more like Sriacha con Ketchup, and had more of a salsa texture to it, than the chili paste con agua sauce that I was hoping for.  Oh well, at least they had sesame oil, with sea salt and pepper dipping sauce to keep the meats lively.    Overall, I give them the A-OK 3 stars.  They stepped up and kept to their word so a bold move from 1 to 3 stars, but the food was still a bit lacking to get up to 4 stay quality.  Still, it was 2am, and anything would have tasted good at that ungodly dining hour; so why was I just meh with the food?  Hence the 3 stars, but I might give them another shot, especially if I'm dining solo again, since other joints have turned snobbish and have a min 2 person requirement for AYCE KBBQ.  Update:  5/31/16: Got a reply from Jessie K saying the menu has been updated with no restrictions on AYCE for Kalbi, apologizing for being refused AYCE service because I was not a party of 2 or more, and inviting me to return for a better experience.  Ok, that moves them up a star for showing concern and apathy for patrons who had bad experiences.  I'll take them up on the offer to come back and report my findings.  The food was decent last time I went there and was actually served (although it was a party of 4).    Original Post:  2/21/16 Been here before and the food was okay, the restaurant is very neat though especially compared to other Korean BBQ places I've frequented (Hwaro, Jin Mee, Honey Pig, and Jun's to name a few).  The Banchan is limited, and for AYCE I find it annoying that they limit certain items (like Kalbi).  Came in late night/early morning, was seated and then brought a glass of water.  I was going to order, but was told that I couldn't do AYCE because AYCE is only for tables of 2 or more.  Handed my menu and bolted.  Wish I had pictures to show, but was refused service, so what once was a 3 star place now gets a single star.",

Servers are nice but very slow and forgetful.   Last time I ate here I got a stomach ache and ended up rushing home like a speed racer! I really only come here because it's one of the few AYCE Korean bbq spots that hasn't landed itself on Dirty Dining.

The menu is large, with three pricing tiers depending on what kind of meats you would like. They also have a wide variety of items not included with the all-you-can-eat, but we were there for meat.   The food's good. Our meat was fresh and flavorful (with the exception of the pork belly being a little bland), and the sides were traditional, so no complaints there. Lee's Korean BBQ only gets three stars for me because of the service. I went there on a date and was surprised to see that the server wouldn't let us cook our own meat. Instead of taking our time, talking and cooking, we had a woman leaning over us for most of the meal. Our server barely spoke to us, and didn't even give us the option of what we'd like to eat first.   They don't switch out the grills here, but they do clean them. Everything seemed clean, but there was a cockroach on the bathroom sink, which always concerns me.",

They also serve corn cheese too!   The meat quality is good, but not as comparable to anything back home in SoCal. My favorite chooses were the brisket and marinated short rib, while my friends loved the beef tongue.   Only thing missing is rice paper!!!!  About the service... You just have to flag down the servers and be assertive, but that's how I feel it always it with Korean bbq.  I would recommend getting the ayce for $26 dollars!",

Secondly, she stated she would bring out hot tea but never did. She was very aggressive in setting dishes down and made a lot of noise. She rushed in speaking with us about our order.   The final straw for me was when she rushed us to pay by saying \"we are closing our registers. Can you pay now? Ok thank you!\" She didn't even ask but rather she commanded in a form of a question.   As we were leaving she then said \"you didn't write a tip are you not going to leave a tip?\" and we asked for the receipt. She said the register was closed and we looked for cash and I said we had no cash. She then yelled, \"YOURE NOT GOING TO TIP?!\" as if she were some child and making a nonsensical demand. She then proceeded to say to swipe our card and FORCED US TO TIP.   I have never had experience with someone so rude and out of line. i could argue she assaulted us into paying a tip in a very predatory manner.   Do not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "~Disclaimer Alright, before I start I would like to say that this is a personal opinion and/or experience.   I also want to state that Korean BBQ is one of my all time favorites because it's a meat lovers dream. Endless meats, sauces, soft rice, and sides (kimchee and etc.).   ~Review So my family wanted to try a different BBQ place  and we went to Woonam Jung Lee's since it was the closest to Greenland Market.  True, the interior was nicer than most other places and the restaurant was well decorated.  But there were a few things that cannot be pardoned/forgiven/ignored.  My family and I had the AYCE and the experience started off really good.  We were having a late lunch and the restaurant wasn't busy. So in theory we wouldn't have to worry about getting our waitress' attention. I was proven wrong.  Generally in most Korean BBQ places in NV, I wouldn't need to flag down a waitress/waiter because they would periodically check up on you. So my family and I tried for a good twenty to thirty minutes trying to flag anyone down for some more food.  By this time my parents were getting irritated, my sister oblivious to it all (because of her age), and I was still hungry and extremely unsatisfied.   The service in any restaurant is pretty important, because it's the second thing people will look at when picking a place to eat.  Then there is the most ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL part of any place that serves food, the food itself.  This was the first Korean BBQ place I've had that only had the oil, salt, and pepper sauce. Most other places have at least two to choose from. The standard oil, salt, pepper sauce and another unique sweet soy sauce or something else.   So we didn't get any other variation of flavors except the taste of meat and oil, salt, and pepper. The meat, as most meat lovers know, doesn't have a big flavor impact by itself. So it was pretty one dimensional. The kimchee's added a few small bursts of flavor, but once we ran out it was nothing unique.   The side dishes like steamed egg, soup, and papaya salad weren't great either. The egg was very basic, the soup went under my mother's critical tongue which didn't pass the test, and the papaya salad was deemed by my father as 'alright'.  The only options on the menu that had a good flavor was the octopus and marinated beef.   Overall, Woonam Jung Lee's Korean BBQ wasn't a favorite.  Maybe this Korean BBQ is more traditional than the others? Or maybe flavors are provincial? There is also a possibility it was just one of 'those' days, where we just happened to be there at the wrong time.",

Services was a little slow but I will say I really did enjoy the ceramic plate to cook on. Never had to change out our grill too often so that was very nice for a change.

I was quite happy with the meat selection and quality of the meat. Personally, I thought the kalbi was worth getting the Level A. Quite a good cut of meat and flavor.  Also really enjoyed the steamed egg and side dishes too although those seem to come out a little slower than the meat you order.  Perfect amount of dukbokki which arrived at the table nice and hot.  The cheese corn was quite nice too!  Servers were prompt and tried to attend to us as much as they could.  Preference was shown to customers who were an older demographic than us however (we were the youngest patrons at the time) - that was not an issue with me personally as the servers were attentive for the amount of traffic at the lunch hour.  Restaurant felt a little on the warm side. Granted, it was lunch time, we were seated by the window facing the front of the store, and we were having KBBQ - so I expect it to be somewhat hot. However, there was some discomfort in the general sitting area due to the heat.  What I did NOT appreciate was that the two female servers questioned our tip directly to us (they did not see the full amount left on the table and did apologize).  They also spoke in Korean to each other about our 'lack of tip' assuming we did not speak Korean as my party ordered everything in English and spoke to each other in English.  Again, not an issue with the quality of food or the price of the AYCE.  But I don't appreciate being spoken about, in front of me, in a language that I am fluent in because of a mistake made by the staff regarding a tip that WAS left.  Sadly, that left a sour note at the end of a great meal.",

    "text": "I have been trying out all the korean bbqs in Las Vegas and this one rates average/in the middle. The quality wasn't excellent, but it wasn't horrible either.   Pros: *Open 24/7 *Located further from the strip, so you don't have to deal with tourists.  Cons: *$$$ For the price you are paying, you can go to a number of better Korean BBQs with better service and more food.  Competition wise, this is my ranking:  1. Moo Woo * * * * * 5 stars Excellent service, good quality food portions, and located in Summerlin, no where near the strip or Spring Mountain.  2. Hobak is tied with Magal * * * * 4 stars Both good, I think Hobak beats Magal slightly with customer service. Food is good, you won't leave hungry.  3. Biwon * * * 3 stars Lots of food, below average service, good All you can eat deals, located on Sahara. Not bad.  4. Lees Korean BBQ * * * 3 stars Surprisingly pricey, stingy meat servings, hard to get waitresses attention. I thought we'd get a better deal, but we had to order twice as much meat or my husband and I would have left hungry. I strongly recommend choosing a different Korean BBQ. We only tried this one because it was open late at night.  5. DJK * * * 3 stars most pricey, average service. I used to love coming here for dinner but it seems prices have increased and serving portions have decreased.",

Were were super lucky to happen to catch a LYFT the day before with an American living and working in Korea x20 yrs who also is married to a Korean lady. We asked, he called his wife (speaking fluid Korean)  and this place was recommended. Bamm! Awesomeness!  Pauline served us and was incredible. We all did the full price AYCE buffet. Our favorite hands-down was the marinated beef short rib; sooo juicy, tender and well-marinated. Wrap it in some of the paper thin flavored radish slices for a perfect \"taco\". Beef tongue, pork belly, and Bean soup were other awesome dishes. It was worth every penny. Will be back! Forget Texas de Brazil. Go here for a better carnivore experience.",

You can go to tofu hut or Korean garden and they all have the same quality of meat it seems like. Just cheaper to eat at, and not 24hrs.   Anyway, there are a lot of older Korean ladies taking care of this place and some can be super nice. Some on the other hand are pretty moody....and can be bitchy serving you. They look down on some nonkorean customers too. We don't mind it. We're there to eat.  They really do bug you about that tip though. There was one time my friend didn't write the tip on the receipt she signed when she paid with a card. The lady gave the receipt back telling her to write the tip. Uhm....she had cash. It's still fucked up to ask though.... She barely helped us to even ask. So I found that very rude and annoying.   In short...  Food: Mediocre Price: $30 is too expensive for a kbbq joint. Too high! Service: Bitchy for the most part. Hours: 24/7",

She even came by every so often to help us cook; we didn't expect that at all. We are so used to the traditional KBBQ places where there's hardly any attention from the wait staff, but Lee's was an exception. Their AYCE lunch is fairly priced at $21 something.

The other price ranges give the galbi meat without bones but the meat is not the same quality.  It's my favorite not for BBQ but for the other items like ssam bap with mackerel and cold soup noodle  .   Their side dishes are good too. It's also closer to Summerlin and next to Greenland so convenient. It's also cleaner than some of the other Korean restaurants.  It's changed a lot since the first time they opened about 2-3 years ago. It's taken awhile to work out the kinks but now I'm glad they're here. It'll be my regular Korean spot.",

    "text": "Although the food is good, the prices are high.   They offer 3 different levels of AYCE on a 90 minute timeline, but everyone at the table has to order the same level - what if only one person wants the extra items on the higher level? I understand they want to make sure people are only eating what they pay for, but that seems a little unfair to the people/person who just wants the minimum priced choices. Seeing as we don't do AYCE Korean outside of SURA, it really wasn't an issue - but it's one more reason for me to NOT use this option. I also feel like if you're going to put a time limit on the meal, you should be quick with food. We sat next to a table who always seemed to be waiting for their meats to come out, which is not fair to the patron.   Anyway, my mom and I ordered - I had Kalbi, she had Bibim Bap with Ojingo (squid) in it and also the beanpaste soup. I didn't really care for either of her dishes and she event commented that they both tasted different than the last time she ordered them there - and not different in an improved way.   The Kalbi was good, it was a good and clean cut of meat. It wasn't as sweet/savory as I generally like it, but it did have good flavor.   I can't bring myself to give more than an average rating as the place seems to have the one challenge that a majority of restaurants have in Las Vegas - poor service.   I got refills of water quite regularly, but aside from that - there was no service. My mom had to flag down someone multiple times and when they didn't see her, she tried getting their attention in Korean, which she also had to do multiple times before they noticed. I could imagine, also, that if you don't speak Korean (like the table next to us who had some complications ordering their meat) that it could be a frustrating experience.   Also, if you have more than 2 people doing AYCE, be prepared for a VERY overfilled and cramped table. There is not much room outside of the grill.",

This place had closed down for a couple of months and opened up again recently. I just went back for the first time since they've opened up again, and I won't be back. It's unfortunate that I have to go to Los Angeles for good kbbq.  We decided to do the AYCE. In the middle of ordering more meat, our server left our table to grab some napkins to wipe off our grill.... WHILE we were speaking to her. The two servers that were working did not fill up our waters and did not check up on us at all. We were ignored a couple of times when we wanted small stuff like soy sauce and extra napkins. I know that I shouldn't expect great service from any Asian restaurant but the food certainly did not make up for it.",

    "text": "I've mentioned this before, but Las Vegas is an awful place for kbbq.  None of them are great, and even the meat at Greenland is only mediocre, resulting in only marginally better kbbq at home.  We've been to Sura, Mother's, Honey Pig, Shilla, etc., and they're all average at best except for the above average price.  I remember going to Woonam Jung a few years back with mum and thinking it was pretty good, so on this day as we're craving kbbq, we decide to head over here for early dinner.    The newly renovated interior is quite nice, bordering on the \"upscale\" side as far as kbbq's are concerned.  Being new, it's clean and as yet devoid of the greasiness that tend to build up when these places age a bit.  We'll see how long that lasts.  The service throughout the meal is good and mostly on the pleasant side, so that was a plus.    We ordered the \"Couple's Combo\", which comes with choice of 3 meats from about a dozen, and the requisite side dishes, steamed egg pot, dwenjang stew, and salad.  Alas, no lettuce ssam nor rice cake ssam, one of which should be required at every kbbq restaurant.  Shame.  We got the woogyup (beef belly), pork neck, and bulgogi.  Beef belly was probably the best (it's one of my favorite meat), and was actually quite good.  The other two were passable, but I wouldn't consider either of them worthy of L.A. standards.  The steamed egg was as good as any, and side dishes were also pretty good.  The stew was extra pungent which I'm not crazy about, but actually tasted really good.    It was $39.99 for the meal for 2 which is the same price as their AYCE, but we figured it would end up being about the same amount of food for the two of us.  Turns out we were right, so no loss.  In the end, I would probably rank this place #1 for kbbq joints in Vegas.  Note, I have not had kbbq at Soyo, but I don't consider that a kbbq place so...  Probably not quite deserving of 3.5 stars, but with the cleanliness and general advantage in overall food compared to other kbbq places, I'll be REALLY generous.  Anyway, I'm still longing for Woo Kook or Baekjeong, or any of the fine kbbq establishments in L.A...  Table-for-1 Factor:  Eh, if you're here to NOT eat kbbq, I think it's fine since they have myriad of other dishes on the menu.",

That temperature problem was really the only negative. Probably had a broken ac that day,  but I would definitely come back. They have the AYCE barbecue as well that I would like to check out. We had the 3 item combo and everything was excellent.",

It is very tender, thick, and delicious. Ribeye also comes as part of that as well. There is also spicy octopus and pork intestines for the more adventurous eaters. I really enjoyed the ayce option as the regular prices for the meat platters are quite expensive.   Currently, there is also a special of 10% off the bill, but the sign is on the cashregister and is written in korean. You just have to ask as they will forget to take the 10% off.",

AVOID AVOID AVOID   I came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation for 10 .when we arrived we got two tables one got all you can eat and another got the woonam and couple choice. Each one you can choose 3 meats and get soy bean soup. So while we were ordering our meats ( that was available on both sections ) she was saying how we choose too much from one list , so we ordered 4 meats and two portions of two of them.  - we asked for water, received it after 20 minutes of asking and we never saw them again  -asked for soybean paste never got it   As we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said \"oh, you didn't get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table \" like wtf? not even an apologize. After we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn't until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats.   This is out raging how horrible the service is , the food was good but it can't make up for how horrible the service was .",

We had a party of two and we were seated right away but they took FOREVER to take our order. 20mins passed and we finally get our meat. She never came to check on us whatsoever. She forgot our Korean Pancakes, and when I reminded our server that we're still waiting for the Korean Pancakes she goes \"aiyahhh\" wth. They have a button to press when you need your server, so we pressed it to order more...it took her 15mims to get to us. Mind you, this place is pretty small. When she gets there, she grabs the tongs from my hand and walks away with it, while i'm trying to cook the sad excuse for short ribs. She came back, turned off the grill with the meat still on it and started to wipe the grill with a napkin using the tongs. Thenwe placed another order of meat, a coke, and 2 bowls of rice. 5 mins pass...nothing. 10mins pass...we get our meat BUT! if you remember, she turned off our grill...so we sat there for another 10mins with our meat on the plate and our grill turned off. We tried to tell her that our grill was off but she only came to us to drop off food and leave RIGHT AWAY. We finally get our pancakes that we ordered at the beginning at the end of our meal. We each had a slice, leaving 2 more. We got her attention and asked for a box. NOTHING. We waited for 15mins. We watched her ring up other customers and stand at the cashier area looking at the menu but she never came back to us for our box. So we just decided to get up and pay at the stand. It came out to $74.00 for AYCE for two people and one soda. EXPENSIVE AF! We were about to walk out but this lady had the audacity to say \"TIP!? Leave a table tip? Tip not included. Where the tip?\" WHO THE HELL ASKS FOR TIP!?! I know it's customary to leave tip but with a service THAT bad, I was not going to leave any but we felt forced to leave a damned tip even though it wasn't deserved.   Not to mention the banchan sucked arse!! It was the saddest excuse for banchan there ever was. SMALL AF PORTIONS TOO. The meat was not the best either. Blahhh",

We ordered brisket, spicy pork, BBQ beef, and spicy chicken as our meats. All the meats we're well seasoned and tasted really good. The brisket comes unseasoned, which is the norm. We are a ton if the bbq beef. It was quite tasty. Also got an order of the steamed egg, which is quite nice and unexpected at a yakiniku place. It came out piping hot, but a tad under seasoned. The side dishes were ok. The kimchi was super sour and too old. Very disappointed. Overall I think Sura is a better value. Maybe if I had dinner with the entire suite of meats available is change my mind. I hear the kalbi is outstanding. But for lunch, it's just average.",

The service was pretty great, but I think they just really wanted me in and out.  They filled up my cup once for water and that was basically it.    When the banchan came out, it was in a neat group.  They all tasted great but there were not enough.  When the chicken dish came out, I did not expect such a small portion.

My co-workers were excited to try this place out since they fell in love with tofu hut but Woonam Jung has way better meat quality. It took about 20 minutes before someone finally came to our table. I ordered a bunch of meat but the lady said I ordered way too much and had to wait for the next round. Round one done! Round two...I ordered about 4 different meats which finished within minutes. (Yes I was eating with a bunch of scavengers) When it came to ordering more it took them 30 more minutes to get to us. After they gave us our order they said no more. WHAT!?! Did we just really get cut off from ordering...YES! I was shocked, but it's okay because we were all full, but still.   The food is good here don't get me wrong but the service was slow, we got cut off from ordering, and the grill is too small! They should add at least 2 grills for a seating of 6 or more.",

    "text": "Disgusting disgusting disgusting! I just left this place with my grandparents about 5 minutes ago and it's by far the worst Korean food I've ever had!   -Slow service and there were only 5 other tables 5:30-7:00pm on a Saturday  - my first plate they brought out was dirty   - we order combo B, $59.99 consists of chadol, pork belly, steak, raw meat wrapped with veggies (eaten raw),  bean soup, and steamed egg + soju. We didn't want the soju so we omitted it, but they forgot the bean paste soup and steamed egg!   - also ordered al jigae (pollack roe soup) and it was super salty!!!!  - they brought out chikkae ( Korean sweet rice drink). My cup had lip stick print and they were so embarrassed!   - overall the meat quality was merely ok. My grandma and sister stopped eating after the first bite of the gumulok (steak marinated with sesame oil) it was so chewy and had a weird distinct taste they stopped eating that.  ugh this place is so gross!!!!! Enough said!!!! I saw Kenny Lee the owner and I wanted to let him know how disgusting everything was.... Dirty, poor quality of meat (btw the raw meat that was supposed to be eaten raw was NOT good!!! The rim of the meat was dis colored and it was no different that the regular brisket cut that is supposed to be eaten cooked. If it was Yoo-ke.... High quality Korean raw meat with sesame oil it would be one thing but the Pyeon Chae (raw meat carpaccio) was so gross and chewy!!!!",

You could be seated the same time as another Korean party, and not even have your order in, while they are having their food served. Overall I would stay clear of this place, there are more professional places.",

    "text": "If you advertise AYCE Korean BBQ, you should have the general decency to bring out more than one order of Galbi at a time for a party of six. We would order \"2 Galbi and 1 Brisket\" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Brisket. We would then order \"2 Galbi and 1 Ribeye\" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Ribeye. The game became predictable, and frustrating. Repeat 6 or 7 times and you begin to think that there's a big sign in the back (in Korean) that says \"Only one order of our precious Galbi per table per half hour or you're fired!\" At lease that's how it felt. To top it off, there is a warning on the bottom of the menu that threatens a $25 penalty if more than a 1/2 lb of meat is left on your table. Seeing this warning was beyond ridiculous and ironic, as at no point was more than a 1/2 lb of meat served to us at any given time.  The service was typical LA / NYC, which means it was pretty much terrible and the waitresses will actually talk shit about you (in Korean) under their breaths. I saw & heard this several times, especially when we tried to manipulate the temperature of our grill. We had to get the attention of the manager (might have been the owner's wife?) to prod our waitress into filling our 6 empty beverage glasses and our empty banchan dishes. At one point we found a sweet spot by ordering with what appeared to be a servers' assistant: he brought us the 2 Galbi and 1 Whatever that we ordered a few times in a row and we felt like we hit the jackpot - sounds sad, doesn't it? In the end we ordered about 9 plates of assorted meats for an average of 3 servings per person at our table, or about 12 oz. per person. Grill off the fat and that's about 8 oz. of $5/lb. short rib plus some random banchan and soup for $25. Not a very good value, not to mention it took 3 hours to pry that much from them. This place makes Sura BBQ Buffet look like an oasis.  Quality of food and Woonam Jung retrospective: Almost exactly one year ago, this place opened with a full-price a la carte menu. The $28 single servings of Galbi were some of the most expensive in town, but absolutely the most tender, delicious Korean marinated short rib I've ever tasted. Worth every penny. This legendary Galbi DOES NOT exist anymore at Woonam Jung. Total bait and switch. Don't even think you're getting the same quality with the new (and stingy) AYCE plan. To make matters worse, the banchan they serve is below average, which is surprising because you'd think that it should be at least better than the stuff available at the Greenland Korean Market next door. I can't imagine that the owners of this restaurant actually eat the same grade food as their AYCE customers.  You guys are being cheapos: The vent hoods weren't turned up to an acceptable level, keeping our friends against the wall in a wall of smoke the entire meal. And, a table for 6 at a truly LA-style KBBQ should have a larger grill than the little circle ones at Woonam Jung. OK enough. 2 stars and I am out for good.",

This place can sucks. I don't understand how you forget when someone's asks 3 times for a spacific item. Water? Cmon that's automatic. I don't care what excuse you have, that should never be forgotten. Last time I eat here. I don't recommend anyone eating here. We had to ask for our check 2 times and only when the next shift came we got our check. Go to honey pig. That place is better. Better food and service at honey pig.",

    "text": "There are many different elements that set Woonam Jung apart from other Korean BBQ in town, but if there is one thing I adore the most it is their marinated \"Gar bi.\" ($28.99 Ala cart) Marinated to perfection and super tender as everyone else has mentioned.  I can eat this alone and be happy.  But even more appealing is that at $24.99 I can do AYCE and eat as much as i want until i'm disgusted with myself.  [There are two type of Kalbi out there: L.A. Style, and Korean Short Rib.   The difference is the cut.  L.A. Style is is a flanken cut, but a bit thinner.  More tender and attached to 3 meagerly bones with fats and cartilages.  This may require more work esp if you like to clean the bones.. nomgry! Wang Galbi (King Ribs) or tradition Korean Style Beef Rib is when the meat is fillet in layers away from the bone in a long flap.  Wrapped around a thick piece of bone several time and consider more genuine.]   The best part is Woonam Jung doesn't skim and serves the tradition style Korean Short Ribs in their AYCE list as well as many other items including Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, and Bulgogi.  They sure know  how to make you feel like a guest of honor with all this fine, quality, premium meat!    Don't be shy and ask for refills for your sides as well. The salads are well prepared in addition to all their fresh banchans. With Kimchi here being my favorite it's pretty much fat fest.  *Tip* Ask for a side of pear juice sauce for your Beef Brisket and Tongue.  I don't know what's it called, but i usually point at the ramekin with the salt and pepper sesame oil and tell them, \"the other one!\"  They'll know ;]  *side note* there's too many way to spell kal bi wtf?",
