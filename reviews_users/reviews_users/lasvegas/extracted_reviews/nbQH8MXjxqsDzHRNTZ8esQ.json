Told the waiter and did nothing about it. We didn't even eat it. That's awful. Also had bottled water . They kept opening bottles without asking. Not a good thing to do. Desserts were ok not outstanding. Don't waste the money. What was good. The steak app, dumplings. The squid was not good. Cheap food at expensive prices. Do not recommend when there so many better selections in Vegas.",

I just hosted 25+ people tonight for a wine pairing dinner and I could not get enough praise and feedback from my guests on the amazing food, amazing venue and phenomenal view. Thank you to the entire Zuma team who took care of our party tonight. We could not have asked for a better event. The food and wine were on point every single time. The quality and taste of every dish we had was incredible.  Everything got better and better by the course. I highly recommend this venue and wish this team huge success. The private dining experience was unmatched and we were obviously satisfied with the service received from Zuma. THANK YOU!!!",

If you like sweet, the lychee and rose petal martini is great. The geishi smash with cucumber was refreshing as well. All the fish we had from the thinly sliced sea bass to the nigiri was phenomenal. My most favorite was the miso cod, melt in your mouth delicious. The beef skewer was tender and cooked perfectly and the fried soft shell crab with sauce was yummy. The squid (calamari) was the only thing I was meh about but it had a nice flavor with the sliced jalapeno. Dessert with a fantastic ice cream and fruit was the perfect way to end this meal. I absolutely loved it!",

Usually there are a a few items for other people that dont enjoy Japanese or sushi on the menu.  However, I ordered karabuta pork belly skewers and the sever told me ,\" we aren't doing that right now.\" Not they were out, they just weren't doing that \" right now\". Mind  you,  I haven't eaten all dinner while my husband dined on sushi and I kept his sake glass full because the staff didn't.  I settled for the ribs.  Sadly they served a soy bomb of a quarter rack of baby back ribs. No knife or fork. No towels after..... needless to say, I left hungry and thirsty. It seemed as if no one on the staff even cared about the experience. Will NOT return. I will spend my Local money at morimoto where the sushi is far superior and sticky ribs are to die for!!!",

    "text": "This is not a restaurant, it is a dance club that serves food.  Pulse pounding music is meant to distract you from the fact that you are being served some fairly ordinary Japanese dishes that have been retrofitted to the \"tapas\" concept that every supposedly \"innovative\" chef is using as \"new\" and \"modern\" despite that fact that some cultures have been eating this way for eternity.  Oh well, since most of their intended customers have never actually experienced other cultures, I'm sure it's impressive to them.  The most important thing is to take pictures of what you been served and post it on your favorite social media account with the caption \"The BEST thing I've ever experienced.  I'm HERE and you're NOT.  I'm BETTER than you.\"  Unfortunately, the food is served in large dishes (strictly for presentation) on small tables and no effort is made to pace your order (as that would involve some actual thought and restaurant management skills).  This makes for a very uncomfortable dining experience.  You could try and discuss this with your companions but you'd have to literally scream over the blaring non-stop electronic music.  Perhaps they would prefer that you tweet your thoughts to your dinner guests.  But at least you can have all this for about $150/person.  Go if you don't care too much about food, a comfortable dining experience, diner conversation, your money or your hearing.  But do make sure to share your experience on twitter, Instagram and Facebook and pretend that it was worth it.",

    "text": "Zuma is fast becoming an all time fave. We've eaten here about four times now and have yet to be disappointed and is now our \"go to\" when friends and family visit from out of town.   It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo hotel above Morimotto and Milk bar in the old art studio.   It's a fun atmosphere with loud music for great energy yet not too loud that you can't hear when talking with friends.   The whole back of the restaurant is a large glass window overlooking LVB and Harmon Blvd.   They have three kitchens, one Robato for wood fired creations, a sushi bar, and a main kitchen in the back (out of sight). Part of the experience is being able to look in on how the Robato and Sushi kitchens execute with experience.   What makes this Japanese restaurant different than other Japanese restaurants is the quality of the craft and great complexity of flavors. For example the fresh sweet corn is made to order. It's grilled over charcoal, stacked, skewered, basted in warm shiso butter and garnished with micro greens.   As a vegetarian my go to is the spicy tofu salad with avocado. The tofu Is warm, crunchy, and spicy and the avocado to cools it down nicely. This is a great dish to share... its a lot of tofu for one person. Everyone alike usually likes this dish. I also order the vegetable tempura, sushito peppers, and sweet corn with a side of sushi rice and this is usually enough for me. All these are plated beautifully and taste equally as great as they look. This is True.   At our most recent visit, the Bone in Rib Eye was an absolute hit. It's served with fresh black truffle shaved table side by the waiter and dressed with a butter sauce (see video). The table side preparation alone had at least one vegetarian longing for a bite. It's very large and generously fed 4 last weekend. The group also liked the grilled Chilean sea bass. Served with green chili and ginger dressing, some at the table said it was the best they've ever had.   Zuma is on the pricier side, but for a special occasion or a Vegas night out, it's worth the money many times over. Ive always had top notch service.   Go check it out!",

Their salmon has an incredible sauce that will have you wanting to lick the bowl but you won't because it's a fancy restaurant and that's just tacky but for the price you should totally be allowed to. The first time I went we ordered their avocado salad and I never did actually find avocado so I never ordered it again. There's other much better overpriced options on the menu to choose from anyway. Also another item that I wasn't really head over heels for was the lobster tempura. It wasn't bad but I think the tempura really hides the taste of the lobster so I don't order that either. Their deserts however are amazing! With the exception of the chocolate lava cake. This place literally gives me tonguegasms. I would eat there everyday if I could.",

When I asked , the bartender, she told me, \" it take a while to make this dishe\"...  I just wish she told me before... when the dishe arrived, I was very impress and got the \" Whoa\" factor. She shaves generously some black truffles on top of my rice and mushrooms. The dish was very good and the quantity  was for 3 people. The reason of my 4 star and not five, is the black truffles were not great quality and probably Chinese. I am not a chef but maybe if you do use poor truffle and want to save money,  just add a little of truffle oil on the bottom of your dishe and at least the pot will have truffle smell. Overalls a great experience and I will be back.",

Every time we go we order a spread of new things to share, that's how there menu is setup. If you're expecting your own entree go somewhere else. Don't be THAT table, ok? I've been impressed every single time.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and very intimate, we've always sat in the booths. Servers are knowledgeable and not uptight, everyone I've met there actually has a personality which is nice and sometimes not common on the strip.  Not even joking if you like Uni, get the fricken Uni, who case it's a $20 nigiri!?!? ITS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.",

There are more places to go in this beautiful hotel make sure you go there and not here.

Expect to spend at least 100+ per person here.   Their cold plates are amazing. Definitely worth getting as many of those as possible. Lots of fish and very delicious. I highly recommend you get as many cold plates as possible. They are absolutely amazing! Only reason it gets 3 stars!   Their sushis are not that special. Same stuff as most lower end restaurants. I ordered a variety of them to try, and they were not that special.   Do not get their miso soup. Its the same thing as normal miso, but with a small portion and overpriced at $12. Staff are very friendly.",

Our server was waiting on food, thus we all ate our main courses at different times. There doesn't need to be 6 managers focused on turning tables. They should put one in the kitchen expediting the food and ensuring everyone gets their food on time and hot.   The management finally realized that we hadn't gotten all of our food and comped our last order.  The food and the flavors are definitely worth the trip. The dysfunction may be attributed to the three distinct kitchens that are fulfilling. I am certain they will get it together.",

    "text": "This is my fourth attempt at overpriced sushi joints. We came here cause my fiance and I love sushi. Also, we were staying here at the Cosmo.   The food is standard. I love sashimi and I love rolls.  I've been to all kinds of sushi restaurants in California and New York and Boston since childhood. With joints like Zuma that charge prices like Nobu, all you're really getting is very high-quality fish. This is only noticeable in the sashimi and even there, it's not a huge difference.  You'll pay like $15 for two pieces of sake, whereas other places may give you 4 pieces for same price. The sashimi was delicious. Their rolls, however, are always simple and not particularly imaginative or yummy. Highly forgettable. I genuinely think these boujee sushi joints have lackluster rolls, a bunch of pretentious small dishes that are tasty but honestly not worth their prices.  Sadly, this place is getting a 2 star review, not because of food, but for extremely rude, trashy service. For food I would've given 4 stars because I know how the game works with these restaurants so for what they're trying to be, they're doing that angle right.   But THE SERVICE SUCKED FROM EVERY ANGLE. supposedly they're open till midnight, you get in and they say kitchen closes at 10:45, we got in at 10:30. So that was fine we said we can make our order quick, but there were being rude from the hostess to the manager to our server. Like rushing and being rude and making faces. Your kitchen closes at 10:45, so does that mean between 10 PM and 1030 we treat those customers like crap? Then you should change your closing time to 10 since that's when all of the attitude here seem to go to the garbage. The restaurant was like half empty when we got in so we ask for a booth, they said no, it would be a long wait. But my fiance was persistent and said it's OK, we'll wait, and suddenly they were able to give a booth within one minute. They are so lazy that they didn't want to put a spoon and fork on the booth table. Pathetic!!! I've dropped way more money at other restaurants, and I would go back because their food was good but their service was also incredibly hospitable. This isnt McDonald's, so if your service is bad, that's a huge problem and I will not return to your nasty establishment that's probably going to go out of business within a few years.",

Service: We were seated exactly at our reservation time and the lead host greeted us immediately with warm moist towels to freshen up.   Appetizers and dishes came out promptly except for the dishes out of the Robata grill.  Delayed most likely because of the packed house.   Upscale Izakaya fusion:  The buta - bara yuzu miso/Pork Belly skewers were fantastic.  The kankoku fu kohitsuji/lamb chops were tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly and I'm ordering next visit.  The ishi ebi no tempura piri kara tofu/Rock Shrimp was good and \"tempura'd\" perfectly.  All rolls were fresh as one would expect from Zuma  Ambiance:  Massive sex appeal at Zuma. There's an open room upscale Izakaya dining area with lots of wood, contemporary lighting and upbeat music in the background.  All details are upscale to provide a beautiful dining experience.  The 3 food prep areas: Sushi Counter, Robata Grill and Main Kitchen is open to the dining area for your viewing pleasure.    I love Izakaya/Japanese tapas style dining that calls for many dishes to be ordered and shared around the table.  The prices are on the high end/Strip pricing and you can rack up a bill quickly. The plates are tasty, but the portions are small.  Couple that up with a very sexy dining area and you have a perfect restaurant to visit for a business dinner when the company is paying.  Message me when you're heading to Zuma for that \"company\" dinner and I'll see you there, as a \"consultant\"! enjoy! =)",

They have an Omakasi menu, which is not just sushi, but rather a tasting menu of what they have to offer.   We opted for the premium Omakase menu, and it was amazing as it had Sashimi, Sushi (including a sushi roll), tempura Lobster, King Crab, Waygu Beef, and others. On their menu, the crab was $42, and the Waygu was $195. It was the only way to access some of the high end options on the menu. It also came with this amazing dessert with tropical fruit, keylime pie, and a molten chocolate lava cake!   For a special occassion, or if you like Japanese with a modern twist, check it out! No gimmicks, no cream cheese in your rolls, just high quality ingredients in a fun atmosphere!",

Sophistication over sushi fare at its finest here!   Truffle toro hamachi and topped with caviar special of the day, was mouth watering and savory to the taste buds!  I was head over heels with this one!  Crafty and unique ingredients in their cocktails are adorned.  Do order up their delectable salmon and tuna tartare.  It's a rare presentation and delights the opening palate.  Tiger prawn robata is grilled lovingly and of garlic goodness.  King crab with ponzu lime butter is for the crab buttery lovers!  It's so rich and I treasured every bite of all the orders ordered up!  Definitely recommended when one is at Cosmo looking for a thrill of seafood Japanese fanfare!",

    "text": "Zuma is loud and pricier than lots of Japanese restaurants in town...but it is also worth it. Simply put, I love it here!  I've been to Zuma Las Vegas at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino on several occasions over the last 2 years. My first impression was that it was way too loud...but once you have a sip of one of their delicious cocktails, you are ready to meld with the ambiance...and once your lips meet the delicate and fresh Japanese cuisine, everything fades and gives way to the symphony of flavors in your mouth.   I brought my love here recently for his birthday, and we opted to celebrate with the Seasonal Omakase. We had the pleasure of sitting at the Izakaya side of the bar and watching all the action and excitement amongst the chefs. If it is just the two of us, this is my favorite seat for entertainment value, though I believe that the sushi bar would be equally enjoyable. James was our server and he was not only knowledgeable, but also fun and engaging over the 3 hour meal, characterized by the freshest ingredients and artful presentations. I'm a huge fan of Omakase and Kaiseki styles of Japanese food, and this experience at Zuma stands out as the best on the strip! Simply amazing! In fact, the Seasonal Omakase was so enjoyable that we didn't hesitate to come back the next week with a couple close friends during restaurant week 2018. For Restaurant Week, $50 gets you a complementary cocktail, appetizer, chef's choice of Maki and sushi for the table, an entree, and a dessert.  Such a beautifully elegant and delicious meal of incredible value...so much so, that you may feel like your parking ticket was the most spendy part of the night.  When you encounter passionate and fun staff at a restaurant, you know you will have a good time. When they are doing it with food that leaves a lasting impression, you know you've found something special...something that I want more of. If it wasn't already apparent, I am a huge fan of Zuma!  - 2018 review #11 -",

Fortunately, Zuma doesn't need to since nobody can match this excellent restaurant that is fantastically fresh both in food and appearance. If you're looking for tapas, delicious sushi, excellent robata grilled meats and fish, innovative dishes like made to order rice crackers and fantastic service, Zuma has it all. I would put their lime butter and ponzu poached Alaskan king crab leg dish up against any other for the world's tastiest food and being Vegas I would bet on Zuma! We particularly loved the salmon/tuna tartare, the hirame and chu toro nigiri, the hearty ribs, the hoba leaf wrapped miso black cod, the flat iron steak with chimichurri, and the spinach in sesame. The dinner was so satisfying we didn't have room for desserts but they are probably equally great. Service was spot on and the orchid laden contemporary Japanese design makes a perfectly comfortable environment. High recommendation for this wonderful restaurant in the Cosmopolitan hotel!",

    "text": "Between 4 and 5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for great service.  This restaurant had me at first glance due to all the Japanese whiskey and shochu they had at the bar.  I'm partial to Japanese whiskey lately, so already I was entranced by the beautiful presentation when we were waiting for our table (we had reservations but came an hour early, and they accommodated us after 20min).  I ended up ordering a cocktail, Shibuya rhythm, and it was delish!  One of the better cocktails I've had, not too sweet but refreshing and just a right balance of alcohol.  I'm always disappointed by cocktails, so I stick to just wine or straight whiskey/martini, and I was glad I gave their cocktails a chance.  Hubby had the Ginza boulevard, and he liked it.  For the food, I recommend: - pork belly skewer:  the best pork belly I've had, so tender, it literally melts in your mouth.  Vegas must have some direct line to pork belly Gods, because Momofuku ramen had pretty damn good chashu, but this beats it. - truffle wagyu sushi was different and delicious.  I'd recommend this for the new experience. - we also enjoyed the truffle mushroom rice hot pot ($55, kinda pricey).  It tasted exactly how I imagined it, but in a good way.  Hearty, rich, deep mushroom flavors with added shaved truffles on top.  Can't go wrong with that.  We also had sauteed shishito peppers, tuna and salmon tartar, and they were all alright.  The only dish I wouldn't recommend is their tempura.  Oddly their prawn tempura was disappointing with a thick batter.  I like my tempura light, crispy and delicate, and it was none of those, although the prawn was juicy and fresh.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and was impressed by the majority of the dishes.  Another reason we will always stay at Cosmo when in Vegas... the restaurant list keeps getting better and better!",

To be upfront, it was the second most expensive dinner my husband and I have ever had but it was well worth it. I think it was 10 or so courses, but once they started coming out they never stopped - I don't know if we were waiting any more than 5 minutes between dishes. The quality... oh my. There was not a single thing I didn't like. I'd say my favorites were the seabass hamachi with truffle and roe, the chef's selection sashimi (I think it was hamachi, tuna, and salmon), the cod, and the bone-in ribeye. Service was prompt, plating was very pretty, and food was unique and it was also nice not feeling like absolute crap later in the night/the next morning like I always do after the mixture of too much wine and lots of heavy food a la fries and pizza etc. (not a reflection of the restaurant obviously but just a general plus when you're in Vegas). We've recommended the restaurant to anyone going to Vegas and definitely want to come back.",

    "text": "When planning which restaurants to go on my most recent Vegas trip, I came across zuma.  I dined at the London zuma over 10 yrs ago and remembered loving it, so coming to the Vegas zuma at Cosmo was a must for me.  So glad that I did...I was thoroughly impressed with everything about it!  I did not make reservations as I was there midweek and figured it wouldn't be a problem.  Arrived at around 8pm and the place was packed...got a little worried.  The hostess was nice and said no problem and that she could probably get us seated in 10 minutes.  Hung out at their beautiful bar until we got seated. Ended up sitting at the bar style seating around their open robata kitchen which was a fantastic view of all the hustle and bustle...this restaurant is BUSY, lots going on between the 3 kitchens (sushi, robata, main) but they seem to run it all very smoothly.  We enjoyed the following items from the menu: Drinks -Wasabi Ginger Mule: Pretty much your standard mule, but their homemade wasabi ginger beer gives it a nice twist.  The wasabi flavor is present but not overpowering. -Hachiko: a vodka/grapefuit/yuzu drink.  Honestly was not thrilled about this one.  The glass it was served in was huge and was basically like drinking some sort of grapefruit punch.  Not bad, but not special....skip. -Zuma Zacapa:  this is their own Ron Zacapa rum served on the rocks.  It comes from their own solera still.  If not familiar with the solera process, Google it.  This was one of the best rum's I've tasted...extremely smooth and delicious.  They imprint the ice with the Zacapa logo, kinda cool. -Semei Sour:  A unique twist on a whiskey sour.  Japanese whiskey with yuzu, which they mix in a jar with real applewood smoke, then pour into your glass.  The smoke gives it a wonderful aroma and flavor...recommend this one for sure.  Food -Age Watarigani (Fried Softshell Crab w/ wasbai mayo):  To me softshell crab is all pretty much the same...but this was legit the best I've ever had.  Perfect light tempura batter, and crunchy outside with delicious sweet meat inside. -Suzuki no osashimi (Japanese Seabass sashimi): Thin sliced Japanese Seabass sashimi, with some yuzu and truffle, garnished with salmon roe.  Really simple dish, but each piece was delicious and fresh, great clean flavor. -Pirikara Hamachi Maki (Spicy Yellowtail Roll):  Pretty simple sushi roll, but again great flavors and freshness, the serrano chili and wasabi mayo give it a nice kick -Robata Wagyu Skirt Steak:  A perfectly grilled skirt steak, medium-rare, served sliced with wasabi, sea salt, and chimichurri dipping sauce.  This was probably our favorite thing we tried, rub some wasabi on each piece and dip in the chimichurri...amazing piece of meat.  Mouth is watering just thinking about it as I write this, haha. Get this! -Buta-Bara Yuzu Miso (Kurobuta Pork Belly skewers):  Sometimes I'm not a fan of pork belly as its fattiness can sometimes be chewy...not the case here.  Each piece of pork literally melts in your mouth.  The sweet glaze and mustard miso sauce set it over the top.  This dish is on the sweeter side, it could take the place of a dessert!  Have it at towards the end of your meal...so good.  I definitely want to go back next time I'm in Vegas to try more stuff off the menu.  I guess you can say zuma is pricey...but honestly the bill was way cheaper than I was expecting and the quality and taste is definitely worth every penny.  The staff was surprisingly friendly, patient, and helpful.  Typically at higher end places that are this busy...the service really suffers and can be rude at times, not the case here!  Highly recommend zuma!",

    "text": "Blue Ribbon's loss has been everyone else's gain when Zuma came through the doors of Cosmopolitan earlier this year.  The quality of ingredients and menus are pretty equal, but the sexy ambience and decor are what take it up a level for an improved dining experience.   Four visits in the past year with two of them being special occasions (Valentine's and my wife's choice for her birthday) make it obvious I enjoy being there.  \"Lobster No Oven Yaki\", roasted lobster with shizo-ponzu butter, is presented beautifully and tastes spectacular.   I dug into the head of the lobster face first for that money flavor both times we had this, felt no shame whatsoever, and actually feel bad for people who don't do it.    Another eye-rollingly good dish is the \"Yaki Taraba Gani\".  The simple menu description of \"King Crab with Ponzu Lime Butter\" really should add something like \"Whitney Houston Crack\" or \"Fuck money, eat this\" because it's awesome.  You're really only looking at maybe 5 or 6 bites at best and that last piece is definitely worth fighting for.  I'd suggest rock/paper/scissors, but a stun gun works too.   And the mustX1000 order for the table is always the \"Salmon and Tuna Tartare\".  That amazing box of such glorious fish is something I cannot get enough of.  It comes with chips for scooping, but I feel like they get in the way of my enjoyment.  Get a spoon and dive in!    The biggest issues have been with the timing of the food.  With multiple kitchens going (robata, sushi, etc), I could see how it wouldn't be easy for a server to manage.   We've had side dishes come out 10- 15 minutes ahead of entrees, hot dishes come out before starters, and all it did was clutter the table with stuff we weren't ready for.  I'd advise ordering by round while enjoying their great cocktail list between.  Aside from that, I am ready to Zuma-zoom-zoom back here whenever.",

No regrets for any dish we tried.  The Sommelier helped us with our selection of sake and it was amazing. We started off with edamame; salted and with chili and ginger. Spicy beef tenderloin with sesame chili and soy (my favourite dish), veg tempura ( batter was so light and crispy), assorted sushi and rolls including the spider roll ( soft shell crab) delicious and a work of art) and a grand finale of the dessert boat packed with exotic fruits and dollops of sorbet to share. They had a fun cocktail called fish in a bag that one of us had. It's unique to say the least.  It's been a very long time since I've had Japanese fare this good. Worth every dollar!",

Would definitely recommend if you have a little time on your hands--the food took some time to come out.",

    "text": "One of the best meals I've had in a long time!  If you're willing to get a little spendy, this is a great spot to visit with an adventurous group of diners. I came with my husband and in-laws, so a group of five, and we had an amazing time from top to bottom.  It's kind of like Japanese tapas: the dishes are smaller so you'll want to order a number of dishes and share them all. They range from salads to sushi rolls to meat skewers, and I think there was only one dish we didn't love out of at least 12. The nigiri is fantastic: super fresh and, though tiny, delicious. The sushi rolls are creative - we especially enjoyed the yellowtail and serrano pepper rolls and ordered seconds. The pork belly skewers were also a highlight, super tender and melt in your mouth.   Beware of being up-sold to dishes you don't really want here. The wait staff are really efficient, friendly, and helpful, but they'll also do everything they can to sneak more plates onto your table than you asked for. We managed to avoid this for the most part, but did end up copping to a $60 dessert plate which looked grand but was really just a taster of a few different options with big presentation. Still, it was all pretty delicious.  The drinks are also great - the old fashioned with Japanese Suntory whisky was delicious, as were the espresso martinis, which my specialist sister-in-law said was the best she had. The attention to detail is also a nice touch, with ZUMA printed into the ice cube in the former and on a sheet of chocolate on the latter. We also got assistance from the sommelier to help us pick a sake, and after learning about some good ones we've tried in the past she helped us pick a bottle that we all loved.  There's an option for a set priced meal at around $130, or $170 for the premium version - but we wound up paying less than that per person including drinks, so I'd say skip that and choose the dishes you want to try most. As I said, this is a pricey restaurant, but if you're ready to spend you'll have a fantastic meal and a fun time here.",

It was a 5-course tasting with multiple items in each course. Everything was good.  I can't remember all of the items, but those that stand out the most to me are the nigiri that we had.  The Otoro sashimi.  The king crab.  The tuna and salmon tartar.  The blackened cod.  The grilled pork belly.  It was just all so good.    I tried a couple of drinks while I was there as well, but one stood out as the superior.  The Burning History was very very cool to watch as it was being prepared, but it tasted even better.  Really loved it.  I'll have to go back and update this review, with more pictures and mor details, but for now, this may be my fave place in Vegas.   Thanks Zuma!",

We sat right next to the robata grill so we got to see a lot of the dishes being prepped and even chatted with the chefs, which I suppose is part of the experience. I liked the scallops and pork belly skewer a lot. We also got the rice pot with shaved truffle that was heavenly and the tempura was juicy and crispy. The steak was another solid dish. The only dish I could've done without was the corn as it really just tasted like corn on the cob that I could've made at home (with a better sauce). My cocktail also tasted like an upgraded version of a fruit juice so I wouldn't get that again, but all in all I would come back for another visit.",

Obviously pricey, but worth it if you love good sushi. Portions are definitely on the smaller side, but this place is great for sharing and they have reasonable prices for sake too. Service was great and I would definitely come back",

Although, seemed they had plenty of people with money to spend there, but for slightly cheaper you can go down to Aria's Herringbone and get the same fill or seafood for $25-40 less.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure I ordered almost half the menu for our party (even if I can't remember every plate, I definitely remember the bill) and I can say that everything was pretty marvelous. A little Americanized as I wish it had more of the traditional items you would find at a hole in the wall izakaya, but nonetheless it was an indulging and fragrant meal for all the senses to enjoy.   Seafood is where they shine here, don't be tempted by the meat selections they keep pushing on you. My favorites dishes were the king crab with ponzu lime butter (it's just the crab claws mostly), rock shrimp tempura, scallops with pickled plum and shiso, branzino with burnt tomato, and grilled sea bass. If you could only pick two from that list, I would probably recommend the branzino and tiger prawn in terms of the price/worth/belly-satiating ability.    Whether it's raw or cooked, everything was fresh and carefully constructed. I'm not usually one to 'follow' a dish's components such as utilizing the accompanying trio of dipping sauces or garnishing with a lemon, but at Zuma, every time you see a bed of rock salt, lime, mustard, relish or anything else on that plate - just do it. It really does complete the dish and as a majority of the dishes have sauces that are heavily butter-based, it really helps to cut the heaviness with added acidity, crunch and various tangs of saltiness. When it comes to the Japanese, they surprisingly love all things mayo, butter and cheese. Wanna indulge like them? Get the sweetcorn with shiso butter. Just walk the strip 3 times afterwords.     I will say Zuma is not for everyone. My prime rib loving boyfriend would not have the common sense to appreciate this place. This is a different atmosphere that asks for patience and minimalism from the customer. Plates will come out one by one at the chef's leisure and portions are Izakaya style (think Spanish tapas). This also means that they're meant to be shared so if you suffer from only-child-syndrome or have territorial issues when it comes to your food (I empathize), it's either time for a lifestyle change or order multiple of each plate. That's not to say that each dish was light - some like the crab dish and rib-eye felt pretty heavy in the stomach despite it's miniature size. These types of plates are not meant to stand alone, but to accompany your alcoholism as the Japanese do so after a long day of work. Thus, this is definitely a place to go all out on your liquid intake more so than your food intake if you want the full experience. If you have an appetite that needs to be satisfied all at once or just love meat more than our ocean friends, I would suggest you going across to STK.   Also, just for kicks I normally like to order something simple to judge how fresh the ingredients are and tried their salmon nigiri - no soy sauce. If eyes could roll into the back of your head and come back to focus in a complete 360 degrees - that's what I think happened to me that night. I almost thought I was eating the seared belly of a salmon. It was like pure Salmon bacon that a part of my soul never knew it was missing.",

What we were appreciative for was the modern take on traditional Japanese cuisine, without being \"fusion\" or mix of other cuisines.  The ingredients stay True to Japanese food, but done in new ways.  Definitely worth a visit if your looking for a premium meal in a hip/casual environment.  Highlights, the miso cod, flavorful without being overly sauced and a pretty good portion.  Tempura was perfectly done, nicely presented and dashi (sauce was flavored with shiso and grated diakon)...just like home cooking, but with a twist.  Cocktails were excellent, again containing some Japanese ingredients, cleverly combined with traditional ingredients.  And a surprise banana cake for our anniversary desert was amazing.   Realize that Zuma is a high end world-wide chain, but that aside, offers some of the best modern Japanese food we've had, amazing interior design, and good service.",

From the bar to the wood walls everything was down right stunning.  We sat at the sushi bar and was immediately approached by our upbeat and super happy server Joseph.  As first time diners we had no clue what to expect. Joseph went through the entire menu with us and gave us some of his favorites. We started with some sake and I got the Wasabi Mule. I could have used a Lil more Wasabi but it was pretty delicious!  We started with the  shishito peppers with lime and sea salt and the sweet and spicy Edamame. We then ordered the wagu beef and truffle sushi roll. It comes with two pieces and is slightly expensive but worth every penny. It honestly was the best item from a restaurant I've ever had. We ended up ordering the same thing numerous times because it was so good! We had a few other rolls as well. the pirikara hamachi roll, spicy yellowtail roll with serrano pepper, avocado and wasabi mayo. Spicy tuna roll and the yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic. We ended our meal with Joseph's favorite, the spicy tenderloin. Absolute perfection! We will definitely be back, I've been craving the wagu and truffle rolls since dining here! This is a must if you visit the Cosmo.",

Personable and enthusiastic staff. Missed a few fine points, like no soy sauce on the table and not bringing a fresh napkin after the original absorbed a spill.  My one complaint is the music. It was so loud and conversation was impossible. They have a DJ and the music is better suited for a dance club than a restaurant. It diminished our experience and dinner was far less pleasant than it should have and could have been.   The food is outstanding but sadly, the pounding, intrusive music will keep us away.",

The fish was very fresh and well cut, with tantalizing rolls and appetizers. My compliments to the chef for the creative use of Serrano pepper which appeared in several of my favorite dishes: a yellowtail / Serrano / wasabi roll and a calamari with lime and Serrano. Delish!  I don't personally drink anymore, but my party tried several cocktails including a stellar whiskey drink that include a hand cut ice cube and smoke burned from a Japanese tree. The reported it to be phenomenal.   Two things to keep in mind if you are going: #1 - as with all places on the strip, you are better of making a reservation. My group got lucky and found a spot at the bar, but most groups were waiting 30 minutes or more. #2 - You will spend money to get the best. Our group of 3 ate our fill with only a few drinks and spent nearly $500. This is not a budget stop, but it doesn't disappoint.",

Quality can be found at many other sushi spots that cost way less.  It is the not in the restaurant but in the handling of the fish by the proper sushi chef. *Uni - $15 / 2 pieces, Snapper - $12 / 2 pieces, Amaebi - $15 / 2 pieces Calamari - Ok. It is very crispy and light and nice with the thin slices of peppers but I feel like the squid was a bit lacking in depth.  Small pieces. Tempura, vegetable and seafood - excellent.  Tempura could've been crispier and more airy. Pork Belly - excellent but expensive.  $15 for six 1\" cubes is a bit high but again you are paying half for the food and half for the service/ambiance. Unagi roll - terrible for the price. It was a boring roll that lacked in depth and was a bit too wet.  (forgot price but was between $15-$18).  IT tasted like a roll from an all-you-can-eat restaurant.  Overall, my wife and I enjoyed the night but wish there was a bit more to it then just the service and majorly good food.",

The food is brought out as it is ready which was great.

The standout was the wagyu sushi, not cheap but good enough that we ordered seconds.  All the sushi was above average (Hawaii spoiled me, probably very good is a better description) and the signature cocktails are worth a try.  There is certainly a lot of Sushi places in Vegas, so its hard to say I'd be back in short order as I want to try others but I would recommend this place for sure.",

Our recommendations-  Love:  Beef Tenderloin  Black cod !!!!  Porkbelly skewers  Yellowtail with radish - cold dish  Mai tai cocktail   Dislike: Rock shrimp tempura - tasted fishy   If you get the beef tenderloin or black cod, make sure you order a veggie dish to offset all that protein. Dishes come as soon as they're ready so that's a plus but sometimes you want to pick at multiple dishes at once and that didn't happen... seemed like everything came out one dish at a time. The waitress recommended 4-5 dishes per person but we were stuffed after 2-3 dishes each. Like someone needs to roll my stuffed self back to my room pls!",

    "text": "Wow!  It was a Friday night and we hit The Cosmopolitan hungry and without reservations. After looking over menus, a hostess engaged us and lured us away from STK ( the wait time helped too).  We liked the vibe and decor at Zumba. The hostess and servers were personable and attentive. Will, our server, covered the menu for us and gave recommendations. He also explained the dishes were smaller, similar to tapas, and suggested 3 dishes per person. There were 3 of us but one friend had eaten and just took a taste so 6 dishes fed us  fine ( we didn't have room for dessert if that helps judge  quantity).   We ordered, and totally enjoyed the following items:  -watercress salad (it had a great kick with the wasabi dressing... loved it)  -salmon and tuna tartare (they kinda smash it but don't by judge the look as it is fabulous)  -dynamite spider ( huge and yum)  - spicy beef (really nice light smoke to it from how it was cooked)  -shiitake mushrooms (delicious! We showed restraint by not drinking the sauce)  -pork skewers (great flavor and rich)   We left full and happy. We thanked the hostess for enticing us to come in as it was a really delicious dinner.   I recommend Zuma for sure! BUT I also recommend you think about how much will satisfy you and how much you want to spend. And if you tend to eat large portions for dinner, I'd say go here for drinks and try some dishes or skip blackjack and go all out on this yummy food experience :-)",

I did appreciate that they customized my salad, because I asked for avocado and tomato instead of avocado and asparagus, but the salad wasn't really substantive. And I got yakitori, but they were sort of chewy and not a particularly powerful flavor. Slow service, too. My friend's calamari took like an hour to arrive. Not worth the price. There are other cheaper and better restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.",

    "text": "My fiance and I were staying at the Cosmopolitan for the weekend and were craving sushi. Him and I had been apart for a while because of my crazy work/travel schedule and were looking to treat ourselves to a nice, fancy, Vegas dinner. I couldn't even recall the last time I had eaten sushi and I was so excited for it. We dressed up in our finest. We arrived at Zuma at around 6:30 PM on a Saturday night and hoped that they could seat us right away as we were starving from being at the pool all day. As we approached the hostess booth, we realized it didn't look too busy. We asked if they had a table for two. They said: \"would you want to sit at the bar?\" We told them we wanted a table, and they said all they had available was the high top. That didn't seem to bother us so we sat right down. We were then greeted, almost immediately by our beautiful server whose name is Sam. She was very warm and welcoming and told us that if we needed anything to let her know. She served us nice, warm still water. I hate ice water and I was so excited and thirsty. There were so many amazing items on the menu, it was hard to choose. Luckily, Sam had tried almost everything on the menu and was able to explain in great depth the appearance, the size, and the taste of each item. Definitely very helpful. We decided on a few rolls, we also got the sushi and salmon box, pictured below and the tofu salad with the spicy Siracha edamame. My fiance and I shared everything. It was unbelievable. Everything about it, the appearance - the taste - and the creativity of the menu items. We got a delicious yellowtail roll, and also a salmon avocado roll. It was just the perfect amount of food to share between two people. There was literally nothing left at the end of our experience. I definitely recommend this place. It was clean, the environment was fun, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious. It was more than just a dinner - it was an experience. This is one of the places that we drove back to LA talking about. I highly recommend this. And Sam... You are the greatest.",

    "text": "3.4 Stars total.  This is a difficult one.  There was more meh then great but the great was so gooooooood.  And the great was the Sushi.  4.5 Stars on this alone for me.  On the next visit for sure the orders will be 80% sushi 20% other.  I mean just look at that picture posted...pure bliss.  Stunningly fresh and succulent sea bass, hamachi, maguro, scallop....then caviar topping off our roll?  Yes PLEASE.    The rest of the experience?  2.5 Stars.  Our first drinks took 20 minutes to arrive.  We ordered the hyped Burning History and a Gin n Tonic.  If I'm the bar manager, I want drinks going out asap.  The sooner customers have it, the more time they have to order more!  The Burning History was nice to watch and drink, but it didn't give me any warm fuzzies.  The next round of drinks took another 20 minutes.   Why?????  We sat at the tables near the sushi bar and man, it was nightclub ambiance throughout.  Dark, LOUD MUSIC, and LOUD MUSIC, lol.  I don't have a problem with it, but you who is reading this be warned.  Our server seemed all over the place.  We were unattended for what felt like eternity often, and the tables surrounding us were all twiddling there thumbs also.  He was running around to everyone but his own tables.  The biggest disappointment BY FAR was the most hyped by the hostess and the server.  The spicy beef tenderloin was a complete bust.  Man, one of the biggest wth were they thinking moments.  We ordered medium rare, it came medium and tough.  The refire took another 10 minutes and while cooked correctly this time, Still. So. Underwhelming.  Trust me, don't order this, its complete MEH.  The rice hotpot with black truffle and mushrooms is a \"signature dish' but is rather forgetful.  First 2 bites was \"not bad,\" and then quickly got bland and regrettable as it is totally not worth the money.  The King Crab in ponzu sauce?  Heckkkk noooooo.  As noted by other reviews, tiny 4-5 bites, the crabmeat is tiny, the sauce just ok.  Way overpriced.  Perhaps the high price is for the presentation if you IG, but thats about it.  Return visit?  OF COURSE!  The Sushi!  The nightclub feeling!  Still have to try that Tartare!  The lobster!  More Robata!  I think perhaps the biggest mistake was having sushi first because it setup the rest for such high expectations, but they all missed.  Skip the dishes I've written about, trust me :)",

    "text": "Zuma is a contemporary Japanese fusion restaurant that opened in early 2017. It's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo hotel where most of the restaurants are located. This is a great place for any event - birthdays, girls/guys night out, date night, etc. There is a semi-private room (with a great view of the strip) towards the back of the restaurant. I loved the open kitchen concept. Pricing is on the higher end side but equivalent to others on the strip.   Onto the food!  Lychee rose martini: I could seriously have 10 of these. It's so delicious! It had the right amount of flavor of both lychee and rose.   Kurobuta pork belly with yuzu mustard miso: my absolute favorite dish. You have to get this! It literally melts in your mouth.   Wagyu beef sushi with truffle: upon arrival of this dish, you can smell the truffle. However upon eating it, the truffle is actually very light in flavor. I was expecting more of a BAM!-in-your-face truffle flavor. The wagyu beef was excellent. It was my first time eating shaved truffle and it melted nicely in my mouth.   Uni, ikura, barley miso sushi: the uni was so soft and not fishy at all. However, this was probably my least favorite dish because it was more on the bland side to me.   Salmon and tuna tartare: presentation was lovely! The salmon had a slight fishy taste to it compared to the tuna but it wasn't in a bad or overwhelmingly way. I loved the crisps that it came with.   Thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, truffle, and salmon roe: salmon roe was great! It reminded me of the popping boba but the savory version. The sliced seabass was delicate and mild in flavor. Truffle was once again very muted and I wished it had a stronger flavor. Pairing the salmon roe and seabass brought a nice texture and taste to the dish.   Jumbo tiger prawn with yuzu sauce: another dish that I highly enjoyed! The sauce had a sweet, garlicky taste to it and I'm a fan with anything garlic.   Saikyo miso marinated black cod wrapped in hoba leaf: I highly recommend this dish. The cod was so soft and had a sweet flavor from the saikyo miso. You really don't even need the dipping sauce that it came with.   Tiger prawn tempura: tempura batter was light and airy. The yuzu sauce was a perfect pairing with this.   Service was attentive and great! I wish I remembered the name of our server but he was awesome! He checked on us regularly and kept our cocktails and drink full. The only thing I wasn't really a fan of is the bathroom. While the inside was nice, it's only 1 stall (for each gender).   I highly recommend this place. Just be prepared to spend a pretty penny here :)",

    "text": "It's hard to give this place 3 stars, but a few reasons why 2 stars are missing from being perfect  CONS  1.  What really bothered my girlfriend and I was the avocado asparagus salad we ordered for $16. It was more of a bowl of a few almond sized paces of asparagus and avocado buried under some romaine greens. The dressing was amazing.  We would've  have complained to the waiter about it but he didn't check up on us in a timely matter, place is busy on a sat night Bottom line. DONT ORDER SALADS here, waste of freaking money. $16 plus tax for disappointment, better off ordering a sushi roll. See pics..  2.  We chose tap over bottled water, and were asked multiple Times during a period of refills to a point it was uncomfortable  \"Would you like bottled water?\" \"Would you like bottled water?\" \"Would you like bottled water?\" -No dammit!! We understand management pushes upsell to fatten up the profits and waiters do it to fatten up the bill for the tips they feel they deserve  3.  Clean the damn bathrooms every hour please  There are 2 toilets (from what we've seen down the hall). 1 for men and 1 for women.   PROS  1. Skirt steak with chimmichurri sauce. Amazing!!!  Nice little char with juices dripping and a side of salt, I craved for more when it was finished   2.  Cured scallops had a party In my mouth. I orgasmed with every one I put in my mouth.  Only bad part was when I ran out  3.  The pumpkin ice cream with ball chocolate thingy for dessert.  I would've got on the floor and licked the plate like a dog, but it's a fancy restaurant   4.  I saw toro on the menu and the waiter recommended this BS roll with seared toro and cavier on it.  Was very good but not worth $47, just a high profit menu item they recommend.   5. The kitchen is open for the viewing witch is a delight. We noticed one chef slicing the sushi.  He was very precise and time conscious, which we enjoyed watching him. He took pride in his job and seemed perfection when slicing thrift the fish  I can't wait to go back to Zuma to dine again, look forward to ordering the lobster tempura  I'm still but hurt about the money I threw away for a bowl of greens.   Management if you read this I want my $16 plus tax back, or just give me a credit for my next visit",

    "text": "Pretty great meal all around.  Tapas/sharing style and everything tasted great.  Zuma is interesting in that it has a sushi counter, a robata (grill) counter, and a back kitchen, all cooking continually so food comes out quickly and fresh.  We ordered a bit of everything for the table and had a few drinks as well.  To name a few standouts, we had the soft shell crab appetizer, lobster miso, chicken skewers, yellowtail, gyoza, shishito peppers, cod, grilled bass, 12 oz steak, asparagus, tomago, and sashimi.  Probably missed a few but honestly it was all good.  The entrees were the standouts to me.  Meat cooked perfectly medium rare and each fish had its own texture and skin that made it unique and melt-in-your mouth.  Steak dish was particularly good with salt and wasabi for dipping.  Lobster miso very fishy but had 2-3 chunks of lobster to make this dish worthy of a get.   Dumplings and skewers were probably a pass.  All things sushi were fresh and great - not as good as you'll get at some China Town offerings but still quite good if you're in the mood for fresh fish.  Drinks ranged from strong whiskey-based to more tropical and fruity, but all boozy.    Zuma is quite expensive with entrees in the $40s typically as a bottom and drinks $16-20 at least.  But this place is worthy of a contender for best asian fusion in Vegas; on par with Nobu.  Has a dark, lounge-type of feeling throughout so really fits the vibe of the Cosmo.  Reservation recommended but seemed like there were plenty of seats near the bar for walkins.",

For a $40 plate I expect the best of the best. I guess I should've known not to eat fish in the desert...  The only reason I'm giving this place more than 2 stars is because the drinks were good.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a Japanese restaurant that practices restraint, Zuma is not it. Granted, it's a higher-end fusion restaurant on the Strip, so the experience isn't going to be that personal. The atmosphere is obnoxiously loud to the point where it's pretty difficult to carry on a conversation. Surprisingly, it was packed on a mid-week evening even after peak dinner service, most likely due to conventions in town. However, the space scream luxury, and so does the menu. They had a new wagyu and whiskey tasting menu as well as a robata omakase that requires 72 hours of advance notice. The omakase starts at $128 for the standard, and up to $168 for the signature.  Without a clue of what the omakase may be and wanting more control over what we ordered, I opted to order a la carte for the table. Having three different kitchens, the shared table items came out in random order, with the robata items coming out the fastest. Surprisingly, the cold tartare dish came out last. We started with the prawn and black cod dumplings, which was too salty for my liking. I was never a big fan of izakayas, but the robata food here is really well-done. Some of the skewers we tried were the kurobuta pork belly with yuzu mustard miso (my favorite and must-try), the sake glazed chicken wings with sea salt and lime, and the beef with shishito pepper and smoked chili soy. I loved the crispy skin on the chicken wings and how juicy and tender the meat was. The robata grill really gave the food a nice smokey flavor from the charcoal. The shiitake mushrooms with garlic and soy butter was also a great vegetable option. Most come with two skewers, but several pieces of meat on each so they can be shared.  As for the entrees, we went straight for the money - the seafood. We started with the king crab with ponzu lemon butter and the grilled chilean  seabass with green chili and ginger dressing. The seabass was my favorite of the evening. It was well-balanced, well-cooked and perfect. Seabass is pretty forgiving to cook especially its ability to accommodate so many different types of seasonings. We also loved the king crab, and the butter sauce was like crack. My main complaint about everything was that most of the dishes, robata included, was very heavy handed with the salt. The flavors are bold including the all the sauces and dressings, but it covers a lot of the original flavor of the featured protein - which is what I initially meant when stating that Zuma doesn't have restraint.   The roasted lobster with shiso ponzu butter is one of the signature dishes and enough to share with two others, but some of the tail meat was overcooked and rubbery. Although the butter, like the other sauces, was really good, it became too salty towards the end. Our last dish was the salmon and tuna tartare, spread on rice chips. Both were a bit on the bland side (surprisingly), but the tuna was preferred over the salmon.   Overall the food was good, but pricey. Could I have gotten a better meal elsewhere? Maybe, but not bad given the strip location and the clientele that they cater to. Service was weak as my water was left unfilled the majority of the evening. Zuma isn't the type of spot to celebrate a date night or a even a birthday (maybe if you were turning 21?); you go here after a drunken night after winning a ton at craps and have money to blow and just don't care.",

    "text": "Zuma was a terrific experience in the Cosmopolitan for anyone looking for a fine dining izakaya experience. Note that pricing is high as is most of the restaurants in these five-star hotels but for the most part, I think the price of admission is well worth it.   Food/Drink: +Drink-wise, they have a list of wonderful Japanese cocktails including a fine whiskey list. I aimed for the Zuma special cocktail specific to Vegas here. It comes with a lovely carved ice and a strong yet smooth heavier cocktail.  +Pork belly skewers: One of my favorite dishes here that I tried. It melts in your mouth and the sauce it comes with mixes so well with the dish as a light lime topping. Comes with a great radish as a nice balance too.  +Wagyu Truffle Gyozas: Truffle me silly. This was a special when I stopped on by and was well worth the price of admission as my second favorite dish. Absolutely loved the truffle flavor that permeated the dish and the meat was just delicious. +Chilean Sea Bass: I loved the presentation of this dish more than the taste admittedly. This sea bass isn't as tender/melt-in-your-mouth worthy as others I've tried but I did like the nice greens balance on top and the sauce was light/nice.  +Yellowtail Roll: I also tried a nice yellowtail cut roll that came with some salmon roe and overall didn't taste too shabby. Admittedly,, I think I enjoyed the cooked items more in comparison.   Service/Decor:  +I sat at the bar and the bartender (forgot your name - sorry!) was super nice and friendly. Got to see some of the magic of the ice creation as well which was great. Food came out at a quick rate and on a weekday, it wasn't too busy although they do take reservation. +Love the decor here. It's definitely a smooth, modern, wood-driven design that feels hip and the music is modern as well.   Would love to come back and try the omakase next time~",

We were celebrating my 40th birthday and I was so grateful that the experience exceeded expectations.  The food was exceptional.  We couldn't decide so we went with the tasting menu with the middle option.  This was chef selected multi-course meal to experience the breadth of the menu.  From the caviar topped tuna tartare and lime sea bass to the sherbet ice cream and chocolate desert, it was exquisite.  Another detail that I very much appreciated was that they cleared and cleaned the table between courses so I wasn't staring at the remnants of my ribeye while enjoying my raspberry sherbet.  I love Vegas, world class dining at every corner!",

So, be forewarned and avoid if you want a quiet classy meal. Food comes out tapas style as soon as it is prepared and they recommend about 3 dishes per person. The craft cocktails were good too. We came on a Friday night with reservations at 9:30pm and were surprised at how busy they were. They admitted that they were still seating people from 8:30pm so we sat at the bar for a while for our reserved table. Although this was pissing everyone off, the hostess was really pleasant and made us feel like we were going to be taken care of. Our server was also fantastic and made us quickly forget about the craziness of all of the rowdy parties around us. As for the food, his recommendations were spot on - get the sea bass and king crab. You won't regret it. Oh yeah, and load up on sushi because duh, that's what they do well.",

    "text": "Fabulous meal and experience. Reservation for 4 on a Monday at 830p and it was full. The ambiance is lively and with warm decor & dark wood everywhere. Ordered 2 dishes each to share and a main steak dish for ourselves. It was more than enough. 2 friends that ordered the ribeye & pork ribs couldn't finish their meal. We didn't want to try any of the back menu sushi/rolls since we've had very good sushi elsewhere and wanted to focus on other tapas dishes. Every single sauce that came with each dish was sublime. We saved left over sauce just to dip our foods in it. Recommend ordering a bunch of small plates to share to experience as many dishes as you can. King crab legs - BIG YES, table favorite Pork belly with miso sauce - BIG YES Corn on the cob - BIG YES Yellowtail - Yes, ponzu sauce is yum, same sauce for wagyu Rock shrimp - yes only because it had the sauce. Without sauce, it would be bland. We preferred over tiger prawns Jumbo tiger prawns - No. A bit over cooked and chewy, so it was the least favorite. We used the left over sauces to dip it in as it was dry. Happy this was a comp dish & we didn't pay for it. Asparagus salad - very refreshing and with the tart dressing Green peppers - nothing special. wouldn't order  Skirt steak - loved Rib eye - was cubed instead of leaving it whole. My friend would have prefered it left whole. Pork ribs - loved it, very saucy. Maybe 5 ribs 4oz wagyu - I asked it to be cooked how the chef likes. Minimum 4oz to order. Simply phenomenal, soft meat with marbled fat which I loved. Came with 2 sauces which I didn't use because the meat was so flavorful. I did put fresh wasabi and the various high end salts they offered on some to see if that enhanced the flavors even more. Was it worth $132? No because it was just 4oz, but I had to go for it. I've had wagyu mixed with angus, but this pure version was by far the best.  Now I need to try the NYC Zuma and the other dishes when I get home.",

We had a birthday in the group and they made us feel nothing special. If you are into high end sushi, skip this place.

The grilled Serrano peppers, the spicy lobster miso soup, salmon, a sea bass sushi and the garlic butter corn. The corn and the Serrano peppers were SO delicious! The perfect sides! The miso soup was yummy too, but I probably could've just went with the original. The spicy lobster didn't really have a lobster flavor or anything. And I feel like they just added sriracha sauce to it LOL. Good just not really worth $12 for some sriracha miso soup. Everything else was phenomenal though.",

The atmosphere was dimly lit and had a modern fusion vibe going on with beautiful dark wood as the main decor. Before arriving I was concerned if they had any vegan options since they are known more for sushi and seafood lovers, but the chef was very accommodating. When I arrived we went to the bar to wait for the rest of our party. They had a huge block of ice behind the bar that they physically shaved small pieces of ice off and that's the ice they put into their drinks. Neat!   Our hostess came up to us and informed us our table was ready. It was a beautiful table in the back of the restaurant for all 13 of us. I noticed there was also chefs seating available where you could see the chef creating the food at the tables in front of you. Our waitress was amazing and the service was exceptional for taking care of us all. She was extremely knowledgeable about every dish and drink on the menu. When I informed her I am on a plant based diet, she told me she would let the chef know and they customized a menu for me. It was awesome! The presentation of the food was great and each dish was explained thoroughly to us throughout the whole meal while the servers were placing the food on the table.   -- Food: The vegan appetizer I had was a Japanese Sweet Potato with a sweet teriyaki sauce, the sauce is so sweet and delicious! For my entree, I had a vegetable sushi roll which included Avocado, Cucumber and ginger. For dessert I had a HUGE fruit basket with a scoop of mango sorbet.  -- Pros: atmosphere, exceptional service, presentation of the food, chefs seating available, fresh food, vegan options, knowledgeable staff, bar in front while you wait for your table  -- Cons: -- NONE --  Tips/Stuff to Know** The dark wood decor is actually from trees that were imported from oversees   Overall, we loved everything we ordered and would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant",

    "text": "Food: 4 Stars Service: 4 Stars Atmosphere: 5 Stars   Overall, I really enjoyed my first time dining experience there. The Japanese fusion cuisine that is similar to the concept of Morimoto but better! Loved the open kitchens. The price is on higher side but it's average price for the strip Japanese cuisines.   The view of the strip for the party room looks awesome. If you are looking into booking a 10/12 people party, you should check out Zuma.   Services was good overall. Our server was attentive. However, the hosts were not so welcoming. Somehow they gave a snobbish vibe. Not really a great first impression but all good after we sat down.   I enjoyed most of the things we ordered. However, the sushi rolls/nigiri didn't look appealing to me. Our server recommended us to get a few rolls. We order one first to try. It was not impressive at all. When I return again, I will not order any sushi rolls. The drinks of the day we ordered were all pretty good. One with lychee and one with raspberry and passion fruit. Both were yummy.   Things we've tried:  1. Salmon and tuna tartare (5/5): it was nicely presented similar to Morimoto. The ingredients were fresh.   2. Seabass sashimi with salmon roe (4/5): unsure of what type of seabass it is. It was fresh and nicely flavored with yuzu and truffle.   3. Grilled Yuzu Miso Pork Belly(5/5): probably one of my favorite of the night. The kurobuta pork quality was excellent. It reminded me of Raku. Definitely getting this again next time.   4. Shishito pepper (3/5): it was like any other shishito pepper.   5. Prawn and Black Cod Dumplings (4/5): it was nicely flavored but not worth the price.   6. Rice hot pot (5/5): with the truffle, this dish is priced at $55. Quite pricy. However, I enjoyed the rice with variety mushrooms and of course the nice flavor from the black truffle.   7. Miso Black Cod (5/5): One of our favorite that night. High quality of fish and perfectly marinated miso. Highly recommended.   8. Zuma chirashi (2/5): It was mediocre like I mentioned earlier. Won't order the roll again.  9. Ribeye with chili yuzu (4/5): it was nicely cooked and the sauce was a great compliment to the steak. I like that they cut it so it's easy to share:   10. Lobster with ponzu butter (5/5): loved it. Great quality of lobster and perfectly seasoned. Will order this again.  11. Chocolate souffle (3/5): average souffle.   12. Chawamushi dessert (3/5): not impressed with this dessert either. It was bland to me.",

The hostess wasn't very informative and so even though we had a reservation, we waited about 10 to 15 minutes.   So I finally went up and asked the hostess what the wait was.  Also, disappointing was the fact how friendly hostess was about putting a note down about the date being my birthday.  It was a seat in middle of the dining, and by the loud party and the waiter was not informed about my birthday.  Anyhow the food is great.  Sushi is even good.  My favorite dish was miso marinated black cod.  So the manager Jedd, he was amazing guy who knew how to handle a drunken party.  People who were sitting by us were very loud and drunk.  So the manager kindly asked them to keep it down and they left.  Afterward Jedd came around and apologize to people who were affected by the loud party.  I told him it was my bday and he made this amazing cake and i truly appreciate his hospitality.  I would come back just for Jedd!!",

I'm not sure how they did it but the fish was so fresh and tasty and the fish to rice ratio was perfect. Didn't try any of their Japanese whiskeys but they had it all the popular and even some rare ones. I will have to come back and try their steak.",

There is more fine wood work in Zuma than in many forests.  The table we sat at was made of  a very large log of some rare wood which was magnificent.  The lighting and music matched the decor and it all comes together as a perfect vibe to enjoy the fabulous food.   We had sushi, robata meats and the truffle rice.  Each dish was served on a unique serving dish,  The rice came in a small wooden box that looked like it was made to last centuries. The rice was prepared by adding a soft cooked egg and then a black truffle was shaved into it.   The food was very good, but the ambiance of the place made it a real experience. This is a great place to dine.",

Ken was our server he had great recommendations n we werent displeased with anything we ordered. Tried uni for the first time and it was soooo delish! The decor and everything is clean modern and contemporary. I loved the feel and the staff was very well educated about their menu. They never let my water cup go empty perfect service.

In its short existence, I have already dined here over 25 times. A big fan of its London sister I had high expectations when the restaurant opened. I was genuinely disappointed my first few visits as they had some growing pains... but, they seemed to have figured it most of it out. Still not quite able to reach the bar set in London.  The decor and ambiance are fantastic. Great design textures featuring \"laser\" cut metal lighting columns, large exotic slabs of wood and stone. The restaurant design/decor may be the one area this restaurant exceeds expectations. The ambiance has a modern and trendy energy. There is usually an active bar scene as you enter.  The food is excellent and the menu is extensive. Obviously the sushi is the star of the show but there are many other great choices available. I highly recommend the wagyu sushi roll.   The service isn't anything special and sometimes disappoints. Not quite in par with the decor and food quality but not bad though.  The wine list is also kinda average with lots of inflated prices and gaps in the pricing curve. Ugh.  Oh well, I keep coming back. The sushi is excellent.",

    "text": "An upscale and very well designed Japanese fusion resturant. The service is superb you have 2-3 people taking care of you.  The prices fitting the location and quality so expect to spend about $200 per person. We started with shashimi's and nigiri, I recommend also ordering the fresh wasabi root. Everything we got  was amazing and unique (for detailed per item review check my photos). We weren't happy with 2 dishes the lamb chops were lacking and the Barzini was too \"fishy\" I know I know sounds like a strange comment on a fish but it was undercooked. The waiter surprisingly and on her own doing took them off the bill. So like a said superb service.",

The pork belly literally melted in your mouth.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly and tasted tender.

    "text": "Food: izakaya birthday dinner with the hubby. I thought it was just ok. Reminded me of Morimoto's in Napa. We had the basic omakase since the upgraded one had lobster and caviar and other things I don't care for. It was honestly too much food. Plus it didn't help that he asked if we \"would like the edamame\", which sounded like it was free but it was not. The winners were:  - spicy edamame (flavorful, large portion) - miso sea bass (melt in your mouth) - steak (delicious marinade with red pepper flakes or shichimi maybe and toasted sesame seeds on top) drool.  - grilled asparagus  - grilled scallops (ask for it without butter. The butter was out of place and messed up a gorgeous scallop)  I was kinda annoyed because I told our waiter I don't like wasabi and yet 3-4 of our dishes contained a dipping creme or creme on top that was mixed with wasabi and he didn't think that counted, so that was super unpleasant for me and made me feel pissy.   Ambiance:  Tables are tight together but it's fun to watch the open habachi kitchen.   Service: Our waiter was attentive, but a stream of different servers bring you your food and some are not very good at telling you what the dish is and what is in it. They also need to change the hostesses outfits. They are the most horrendous skirts ever. Supes ugs and doesn't even go with the Asian theme of the food.   If we go back, we are definitely going to pick and choose the winning dishes. There was a lot that was meh in the omakase and it was WAY too much food.",

    "text": "Asian fusion Izakaya style Japanese food is my FAVORITE and Zuma killed it. Third floor of the Cosmopolitan has a lot of restaurant choices, but Zuma is my new favorite. Izakaya is a type of bar/restaurant with small inexpensive (not in the case of Zuma!) plates meant to be eaten with alcohol. Aka Japanese style tapas?  We ordered a lot, here are my favorites ranked highest to lowest :) 1. KUROBUTA PORK BELLY SKEWER: 2 pieces served with yuzu mustard miso. Heavy on the miso with just a slight kick of mustard. Favorite order of the night. Kurobuta is like the wagyu of pork. Fatty, but melt in your mouth kind of fatty, not that never ending chewing kind of fatty.  2. MISO BLACK COD WRAPPED IN HOBA LEAF: In Japan, this dish is called Gindara misozuke. Gindara is a type of cod, closest US relation is the black cod. Buttery, melt in your mouth texture with a miso sauce to eat it with. It's a must order when you go to Izakaya and the portion size was great.  3. SUSHI ROLLS: I can't remember the name, but what we ordered were all great.  4. SOFT SHELL CRAB WITH WASABI SAUCE: A good starter plate. The sauce was what made the plate. If you like wasabi, order it. If not, don't order for just the crab.  5. SHIITAKE WITH GARLIC SOY BUTTER: The flavor was good, but it overpowered the shiitake and the mushy presentation was not my favorite. Shiitake has a lot of flavor on its own and I couldn't appreciate it with how buttery they were.   DON'T ORDER: SHRIMP TEMPURA (boring, did not stand out for any other restaurant) SPICY LAMB WITH MYOGA (served with a gojijan sauce, Japanese don't normally eat lamb... so don't order it at a Japanese restaurant, duh)   Dark, romantic vibe that got a lot louder as the night went on. Music was pretty low so easily able to have a conversation. They have strip view seating, but it's in a party table section so don't expect dinner with a view here.  Strong sake menu and the sommelier can help you out with your choice. The JAPANESE GARIBALDI: V8 on the rocks is what we decided it was. Low alcohol content, tasted more like juicing cleanse than date night drinks.",

I sat next to the robata grill which was nice because you could watch the shishito peppers, asparagus, mushrooms, etc being grilled. Pretty great experience overall.   The service from my waiter was amazing. I felt like he had good suggestions for the menu and he was so so helpful in helping me choose different dishes. I came by myself, and I wanted to try a few different things without over ordering. He was great at helping me choose some larger portioned dishes with some smaller dishes.   I had the saikyo miso marinated black cod wrapped in hoba leaf, yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish/ponzu/pickled garlic, zuma chirashi maki roll, and chocolate molten cake with ice cream. I highly recommend  the yellowtail sashimi, zuma chirashi maki roll, and the chocolate molten cake. All of them were very flavorful and so beautifully presented. I felt like the black cod's sauce was great but I barely dipped it in the sauce because I felt like it overpowered the cod. That's just my preference, but I probably wouldn't order it if I came for a second time. I think I'd want to try something new.  Overall, the food was good but I probably wouldn't get the black cod because I felt like the sauce was overpowering the cod. The other dishes were great and would definitely recommend those. The restaurant itself is very modern and clean but still very inviting.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here on a Friday night expecting to get some good Japanese food, which is our favorite.  We ordered the Premium Omakase menu, which with tax and tip and 2 drinks ran us around $500.    Now for that price, I expect a meal to be absolutely perfect, but there were a few things we found to be poorly executed that brought our experience down a notch.  I think the thing that bothered us the most was the noise level, which is extremely loud dance music.  I know it's Vegas, but it was simply louder than we expected for such a high end meal.  DO NOT come here expecting a quiet romantic meal.    The food was all very good, but not $500 meal level good.  The presentation was spot on, but various itmes were sub par.  The sushi portion, for example, was good but not transcendent like you would expect at this price point.  Food volume and pacing were also an issue.  We were literally served 15 separate dishes.  This made for a very uneven pace to the meal (longer than 2 hours with long gaps between courses) and my wife and I felt like we were going to die from how much we ate.  I wish we had gotten fewer dishes of higher quality.  The service was immaculate and I can't say enough about how nice the staff were.    The decor was great, especially the main bar which is one solid tree trunk, so cool!  All in all, good food but not worth the price imo.",

    "text": "My friend and I came to Zuma last week for \"friends & family week.\" My friend is vegan and allergic to sesame AND soy. So why would we come to a restaurant known for sushi? Lol. Good question. We were hungry and got invited so why not?   Chef Erick Melendez was up for the challenge! We started off with drinks. Both of us got the Rubabu. It's a little on the tart side, but oh so refreshing! The juice is sweet enough without any added sugar. I also thoroughly enjoyed the foam that sits on the top of the drink throughout its consumption. Even though it's an alcoholic beverage, you can't taste any hint of alcohol. So beware standing up after two of these (as we found out for ourselves).  The vegan/soy-free/sesame-free items that Chef Erick made for us were the Zuma Kappa Maki (ginger, cucumber, & avocado roll), a citrus avocado & tomato salad (not a menu item), Shishito no Suage Wafujio (shishito peppers with wafu salt), slow cooked leeks with shaved truffle (not a menu item), grilled sweet corn, and grilled shitaki mushrooms with garlic chips. Chef Erick really pulled through for us. It was amazing how much attention was put into every detail of making our veggies look and taste amazing!  Since I am not vegan or allergic to anything (that I know of anyways), Erick also made me some extra dishes. These were the Gindara to Ebi no Gyoza (prawn & black cod dumplings), Tomato to Nasu no Wafu Salada (tomato & eggplant salad with ginger & spring onion dressing), and the Maguro no Tataki (sliced seared tuna, chili daikon, & ponzu sauce). I would highly recommend all of these phenomenal dishes.   Last but not least, for dessert we had the fruit platter. This was by far, the most beautiful bowl of exotic fruit I've ever seen, and the taste of this fresh fruit matched it's beauty. Needless to say, my friend and I had a great experience at Zuma and are looking forward to returning soon!",

The lobster tempura was out of this world. The Chilean sea bass was superb. The Madagascar prawn was so sweet and fresh. The Wagyu ribeye topped with shaved truffles was outstanding. The dessert sampler was so mind blowing. The coconut custard with mango and papaya was so amazing. My husband who doesn't really enjoy dessert claimed that that was the best dessert he ever tasted. This place is definitely a must for foodies. It's not cheap so if you're looking for a bargain, this place  is not for you. Service was very attentive.",

Waiter came by after 5 minutes and we ordered drinks I had a bitter and sour that was great and had me feeling real good my wife had a non alcoholic drink with orange and pineapple she said it was so good she had 2.  We waited about 15 minutes and ordered the waiter was very helpful. We ordered the tuna and salmon tartare and it was possible the best one I have ever had paired really well with sea weed chips and scallions. The tuna would melt in your mouth. We also had the steak with shisito peppers this one was average but paired really well. It's is something I can later do myself on the grill. The next plate we ordered was the wagyu and truffles it also had an aioli sauce to dip in I thought they were pretty good but a waste of wagyu because the wrap over powers the taste, my wife didn't like these I ate about 4 to her one.  We finished off with 2 rolls from the sushi menu the better one in my opinion was the wagyu beef sushi with truffle you can taste everything so chew slow.  The second one was Prikori Nagyro and it contained tuna with green chili, spicy mayo and tobiko. This one was my wife's favorite the waiter brought us ponzu sauce aside from the soy sauce we had on the table. We finished with a desert not on the menu it contained vanilla ice and a hot little chocolate cake that had melted chocolate inside the hot and cold always pairs really well.  Overall I would go again this place is worth the price so be prepared.",

    "text": "We were lucky enough to attend the \"Friends & Family\" pre-opening event with our friends. The moment you walk into Zuma, the experience is beyond amazing! The restaurant design and decor is breathtaking. The service is impeccable. The food and drinks are \"wow\" level.   We started at the bar and it was mesmerizing watching the bartenders work passionately to make their signature craft cocktails. The Geisha Smash is the drink to get. We had 3! Smooth and all the flavors balanced perfectly. I also had a signature drink that was comparable to a Salty Dog, I forget the drink name, and it was a cloudy pink drink that was quite tasty as well.  We tried a bit of everything on the food menu and we got a good variety. I don't think we had a bad dish in the bunch, and we had many different dishes. I apologize as I don't remember all details of the menu items but can label accordingly once the menu is posted. My favorites were the thinly sliced sea bass with salmon roe, king crab, hot pot mushroom rice, lobster, corn on the cob, soft shell crab sushi, branzino, passion fruit dessert, molten chocolate dessert. So many delicious dishes. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything here.  All in all, we had a very memorable experience and I am so impressed with everything here at Zuma. We may have to get a group together so we can use the group dining area in the back for the view! Thank you to the entire team at Zuma for a lovely night. We really enjoyed everything!",

I did order other stuff too but they weren't memorial as the first two. For example, the beef and pork skewer it wasnt that great because it was tasteless. The customer service here they work as a team. They try to keep the table clean and assist their guests as much as they could. If I were to go back here again I would probably try the tomahawk and wagyu A5 beef. Overall, it was a good experience.",

Oh it's a beautiful room -- seems to be there m.o. based on reviews I saw for NY branch -- beautiful building but mediocre service and food.  A lot of things I hated about this place. Mostly around service. Also the bathrooms, but I could write a treatise on why they suck but it's really not a big deal. Ultimately my server knew nothing.  The sushi was a big notch below Tao (where I ate 24 hours ago) and everything cost more than Tao (the sake I had last night is $40 more here).  If I'm paying these prices you'd better nail the service and food and this place does neither. Avoid the fatty tuna caviar roll, it was overhyped, poorly described and not good. My waiter was a fucking moron btw but that's a whole different story. Also the sommelier was extremely unimpressive.",

We were at a high top tucked in the corner, but there were others around us so it wasn't like we were out of the way. That being said, there were 2 items that shined and would be a reason to go back, the wagyu sushi and the hamachi cold dish. Both are not to be missed.

BUT, we went for a few drinks and dessert last night (NY day) and it was by far the worst experience we've had to date there. We sat at the bar and ordered our normal drinks, my favorite is called the rubabu (which main ingredient is passion fruit), got the drinks and immediately I knew something was wrong with my drink; I asked the bartender if they could remake it because it was too sour and she said \"we ran out of the passion fruit liquor part so she had to use an actual passion fruit which made it sour.\" She did remake it and added something to it to make it less sour but it wasn't the same. This particular bartender made our overall experience horrible; she  took forever to take drink orders, was quiet, not personable, and never offered us water (when we ordered a dessert). I think I was most surprised that they weren't disclosing that they ran out of an important ingredient in many cocktails, I almost wanted to tell people at the bar not to order that drink because of it. Overall I would normally give the restaurant 5 stars, but this last experience really ruined it for me.",

How do you fuck that up after being in business for more than 2 weeks?  2. It took 20 fucking minutes for them to serve us edamame and miso soup. Lol it's like they had Jack in the back trying to grow his bean stalk. What a joke.  3. Ordered \"marinated\" chicken wings. I actually asked if these sad excuses for chicken wings were seasoned because they tasted like they were boiled in water.

It seemed to get louder as the evening went on. It was pretty horrible, but if I closed my eyes as I ate the sushi, I felt like I could teleport to another world and the music would fade away.   This fresh, pricey, creative, and inventive Japanese restaurant is well worth the money if you can splurge. Just do it.",

    "text": "Definitely NOT the best sushi / Japanese place in town  DECOR:   Fabulous.  Lux.  The bar is made out of Monkey Pod wood.   Yes.. Monkey Pod.  Gorgeous   PEOPLE:   Wanna be trend setters.  Convention attendees.  People blowing their casino winnings.  Drunk but well dressed people.   Music:  lounge & Ibiza fusion really nice  VIBE:  hustle, bustle, loud music & obnoxious patrons   FOOD:  adequate.  Beef dishes chewy & not tender.   Too many cocktails on menu that are absolutely TOO sweet.  Creative food offerings but rather small and not as top quality ingredient wise as it COULD be.     SERVICE:   Many.  Ratio is probably 1 server to every 10 people and 1 bartender to every 3 people at the bar.   Staffed to the Max but VERY slow and that creates too much tension at the table as everyone tries to fill dead time/wait time with conversation... while staring at everyone else at other tables getting their food.",

The kitchen is open and while we opted for a table, the chef's seating would have been fun.   Of course ordering too much food, we were presented each plate omekase style.  We started with shishito pepper with sesame tofu dipping sauce. The thing about shishito is that you never know which one is hot or not. These babies were grilled up nicely. Anything sesame is always a winner and the tofu gave it a great consistency.   The crispy fried squid, green chili with lime was delicious. Light and almost fluffy, every bite was a hit of food crack!  Two cold plates of the seared beef with soy, ginger, lime and coriander and seared salmon with shiso and lime-soy were  From the charcoal grill the skewered kurobuta pork belly with yuzu mustard miso. Just enough fat for flavor. Also on sticks, the fresh scallops with pickled plum, shiso and butter came with a nice char and so sweet.   For dessert I had the chocolate buddha cake with mango sorbet. It was almost too cute to eat.   The service was steady on and expedited like clockwork. The menu is extensive so I think multiple visits are required!",

    "text": "Mixed experience. Since I had amazing beef and one of the worst sushi rolls. Sat by the bar. Got the menu right away. Got good drink in the meantime. Ordered spicy beef and 2 rolls of sushi. The beef was delicious. Really the meat itself, the way they cook it, and not too spicy. Also the sesame is a great extra to the tastes. The problem was I got it before the sushi. Ok no worries I thought. But then the sushi arrived, the problem was that it wasn't made with soy paper like I asked. So I say if you make a mistake, at least try to improve things and get the right one quickly. It took the. 15 minutes. When I got it it was the last thing I wanted to eat. Just the craving was long gone.",

Lobster tempura.   Drink: from the cocktail list the passion fruit martini was a hit. They also make a mean espresso Martin.   Dessert- just share the whole platter!

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a couple of days and was more than happy to be able to check off some of my old bookmarks! I've heard about this particular Japanese Tapas/Robata grill place for a while and was excited to go try it since I was staying at the Cosmopolitan. It was just a jump, skip, and a hop away from me.   Zuma is located on South Las Vegas Blvd. right on the strip. It's inside of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino on the third floor. I believe there's validation at the front entrance if you're driving there.   Just like the hotel itself, Zuma is a trendy and upscale Japanese restaurant with large windows facing the street. There's a bar area in the front for drinks and customers can also order food there. The interior is spacious with many small and big tables. The ambience is darkish with a lot of mood lighting which is pretty much the norm for a lot of the restaurants inside the Cosmopolitan. There's a raw bar on one side of the restaurant and another cooking and Robata Grill station on the other side. We were seated right away. (It wasn't really crowded on a Tuesday night.) Our server was both polite and kindly suggested a couple of dishes he liked himself. We ordered a few to share and got some tasty cocktails too. When in Vegas.....  Overall I would definitely go back and try more of their other dishes like the Robata meats, skewers, and signature dishes. They have so many delicious looking dishes on the menu, I'm sure there's something for anyone's discerning tastes.   Lychee & Rose Petal Martini : I was hesitant in ordering this, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be too sweet. Instead it as the right amount of fruit flavor to alcohol. I had two of these. : ) If you like fruity cocktails, this is the one for you.   Steamed Baby Spinach w/ Sesame Dressing : This was good. It's a cold dish. The sesame was all mixed into the spinach, but I still wished there were more of the dressing.   Prawn & Black Cod Dumplings : This dish seemed like a favorite here so we ordered it. It's similar to Chinese Fish Dumplings except with Black Cod. If you like fish dumplings, you'll like this dish.   Japanese Sweet Corn w/ Shiso Butter : This was a good side to order. The corn were all slathered in butter. I had to floss majorly bad after but it was worth it. : )  King Crab w/ Ponzu Lime Butter : This was one of their Robata Seafood items. I love King Crab so I had to order this. This isn't a big portion; probably about one leg. The ponzu lime butter really makes the dish. I loved dipping the king crab into the sauce! If you're there with a group, I'd suggest ordering more than one for the table.   Green Tea & Banana Cake w/ Coconut Ice Cream & Peanut Toffee Sauce : This was delicious! I'm glad I picked it from all the other desserts on the menu. The presentation was on point too. The thin slices of banana on top was a nice touch. The coconut ice cream was light and smooth. However the green tea part was only a thin layer on the bottom of the banana cake so that was a letdown. I feel like they should've at least have half of it be green tea.",

We really enjoyed the tartare starter with both salmon and tuna. The presentation was prefect (see all the yelp pics) but know that the chips break easily so you have to spoon the fish onto them. There was so much to eat, but my favorite was the giant prawn - they really ARE giant and apparently flown in from Madagascar. The meal was paced well -- you aren't bombarded with plates and the server pays attention to your drinks and takes plates away at the right times.   If you love sake they have quite a selection! I prefer chilled nigori (cloudy sake) and even tried sparkling sake for the first time here. They have a sake expert going around the room if you need advice!   The bill was higher than I estimated, but quality and service was excellent. I would definitely return the next time I am in Vegas.",

For appetizers we ordered: -shishito peppers -prawn and black cod dumplings -crispy fried calamari -Hamachi usuzukuri pirikara which is yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish with ponzu and pickled garlic  From the Robata Grill section we got: -yaki taraba gani-king crab with ponzu lime butter (see attached photo.)  We also got a couple orders of spicy tuna rolls and special rolls.  And that dessert platter....OH MY GOODNESS. That freakin presentation man.....wow. Yeah, it was normal dessert items with gelatos, mixed fruits, chocolate cake but my favorite item there was the ginger bread.

Exceptional service and each bite {with the exception of the red snapper which I didn't love} was phenomenal.  The sea bass with the wasabi cream sauce is, no question, the best sea bass I have ever eaten anywhere.  I sat at the rabatta grill {sp?} where I could see each dish hand prepared and grilled.  If you're a foodie, make a reservation and go here - highly recommend.",

The decor is an understated wanna-be go green look, with earth-tones and lots of brown. The music was very annoying and strange, the waiter told us the music being pumped into the restaurant was mixed by their own DJ who was paid to go to parties and come up with custom mixes. It was hard to pin down what genre of music it was, it just didn't go with the relaxed vibe of the restaurant. I want to guess it was closer to club type mixes. The sushi was just Ok and my colleague and I are BIG sushi buffs, both agreed it was a bit mediocre, especially considering what we paid. The portions were also quite small. Service was good. Although we seemed to have two waiters who didn't seem to know who was getting what. Regardless they were very attentive and seemed helpful with the menu and suggestions.",

    "text": "We ordered the Omakase signature option (the least expensive at $138 pp) and the experience was amazing. Much to our liking the dishes came out rapid fire like a True Izakaya. There were so many fantastic dishes it was hard to keep track. My Japanese wife said it was like her mom's dishes, only better. High praise indeed! We especially liked how perfectly prepared the sushi rice was. It's a small detail that set this place above the fray. The only negative was our experience with the sommelier. If anyone at Zuma reads this, here are some tips for him to step up his sake technique: 1. Sake isn't wine but you're treating it that way. You don't \"taste\" sake before you pour. It doesn't go bad like wine so tasting before pouring is a bit silly and weird. 2. Proper manners dictate serving and receiving sake with both hands when someone else is pouring. Don't tell people to put their glass back down on the table like you did. 3. It's not wine so you don't have to keep pouring it for us. Leave it within reach or on the table which is the proper way. The cups are tiny so you'll be pouring constantly! Luckily our waiter corrected this faux pas. Step up your sake game and this is an easy 5 stars. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikihow.com%2FServe-and-Drink-Sake&s=bbe35496d65bb504f71150b4a64e4964d2799b6b66e1475f77911aa7036bb2fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikihow.com/Serve-and-Dr...</a>",

For a fancy restaurant, I was expecting more dinner choices on the menu, but it was mainly tapa style plates. Very small portions. Sashimi plates was delicious but sushi rolls were blah. Wasn't anything special for about $28+ a roll of only six pieces. No sauces either. Very plain. We left hungry. Alcohol/drinks are also very high for a small amount. If the food was superb it'd be totally worth it. We just felt the tastes didn't match the pricing. Ambience was ok, very dark inside with trance music up extremely high like a club. Our waiter was nice. Overall, it was an experience in our books.",

I reserved a specific table against the \"tree\" wall overlooking the entire restaurant. Our server recommended 3 plates prepared w/no soy. EVERY ONE of them was a home run! She had a signature berry cocktail (red, can't recall name) that she loved! The waiter was smart & very helpful & most attentive. The decor was elegant modern (but not insulting) Japanese. The woodwork is crazy nice! It was packed but not intrusive.  As for my tastes, I've worked for the Japanese & appreciate their culture. This place is incredible! I have NO COMPLAINTS!

Excellent menu selections from either the grill station or sushi station.

He requested window seating upon making the reservation and they were able to accommodate - on top of it being Valentine's Day! Another amazing thing is that they didn't seem to overbook, which made us not feel rushed at all. I work at a restaurant so I know how busy it can get but it was very comfortable :)  So now the service and food. The service was amazing, our waitress gave us really good suggestions, our waters were always filled, everyone was extremely friendly! And like I stated, service was not rushed at all!  For drinks, we ordered their rose & lyhee martini and one of their margaritas. Both were tasty!  The food WAS PHENOMENAL!! So so yummy. We had the calamari, which was seasoned SO perfectly. So perfect in fact, that it didn't come with sauce because it didn't even need it! Just sprinkle some lime on it. We also had their spicy tuna maki roll. So so good. The quality of the fish was there!! And the last appetizer we ordered was their shrimp and cod dumplings. AND WOWZA. Best dumpling I've ever had.  the cod had such a good taste to it. For our entrees we shared their wagyu skirt steak and king crab. The wagyu skirt steak was so tender. It came with chimichurri, sea salt, and wasabi on the side, which I wouldn't think to eat with steak but oh mannnn, it made an amazing steak so much better. And the crab had a lemon butter sauce on it and it was so meaty! Lastly, we had their chocolate dessert. It was a chocolate lava cake with a caramel and praline(maybe) sauce  with a vanilla ice cream. It was very sweet, but it definitely topped off my dinner.   Everything was amazing - presentation, service, quality of food, just really great! It truly made my valentines dinner a memorable one!",

Amazing selection of drinks. I had a Japanese IPA, quite good. Menu selections mainly for sharing. We had miso soup, tempura shrimp and veggies, fatty tuna sushi roll, and the rib eye, with rice. Dessert was key lime pie and the fresh fruit with sorbet. Excellent service. Will definitely return.",

There were only a couple staple dishes (sashimi, tempura, and sushi roll), the rest were unique, creative, and delicious. We are SO glad that we went with the Omakase. All of the dishes came out really fast and we were thinking we were going to be done soon after each plate. The food kept coming for almost 2 hours. Dinner was about $450 all in and worth every penny. My favorite had to have been one of the last dishes, Cod (buttery melt in your mouth), the sea bass, or the Spicy filet. But really, it was all fantastic. I ate the entire Japanese man chocolate dessert--  Chocolate/raspberry amazingness. Thank you, Zuma! What an experience in dining!",

    "text": "We are the biggest fan for Japanese food and have done many Omakase meals in Japan and in the US. After spending almost $400, we had the most unorganized and uninspiring Omakase ever. It was a lot of food but nothing stood out or wowed us. Can they come up with something not yellowtail in ponzu sauce with jalapenos, miso black cod, and grill scallops? The best dish was the peanut butter cream spinach... Everything was served family style, which is not very Omakase to begin with. Server said it's 5 courses so we expected 5 dishes over 1.5 hours. However, 4-5 small dishes were served so fast in the first 15 mins, to the point where I was like \"woh, can we please slow down? Our table is full of food and we didn't expect to finish our Christmas meal in half an hour.\" Then the server said \"these are all your first course and your second course is sushi which will be served shortly after\". However there was one more dish before sushi. After the sushi was served, he's like \"after this will be your last course, stuff from the grill.\" I was so confused at that point... so I was at course 2 and all the sudden at the last course? Our server was good but there were too many tables for him to take care of. Normally when we do Omakase, a server takes care of 2-3 tables at most so they can explain the dish and where we are at the course. This is the most non-omakase meal in the name of omakase, merely a mash up of dishes. I have no idea what the chef and management are thinking. If you're severing 10+ dishes, just call it a 10 course meal, which is better advertisement and less confusing. This is a mass production ok quality course meal that's not worth $400. We have no problem spending that money, as long as you're really serving good food and experience. This was neither of those. I don't know what other people's price point is, I don't think my ask is too much. Have some decency and make some improvements to your omakase menu. go to Japan and try some Michelin restaurants' omakase. Otherwise don't call this Omakase. Or maybe call it Omakase for dummies? It was a joke.",

In the 2 years living here, never had tried it till last weekend... Man! So not disappointing! Probably one of the best palate experiences I've had being here... Just amazing food.   There were 4 of us and we went with the Omakasi Signature style choice at $138.00 per person This had the: edamame robata asparagus  spicy fried tofu with avocado and japanese herbs seabass sashimi with yuzu, truffle and salmon roe* sliced seared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu sauce lobster 1 1/2 lb with spicy ponzu and wasabi mayo salmon and tuna Tartare Ribeye with black truffle shavings (Just ridiculously amazing) Black Cod There was an assortment of sushi that was that was on a tiered presentation And an assortment of desserts  The quality of the sushi was up there with Nobu... Just so flavorful!   To drink I had a Japanese Old Fashion, okay maybe 3 of them... Made with Japanese Whiskey -  Suntory Toki  - just amazingly smooth and delicious!  As you can tell by what they served, we weren't hungry when we left. The food and service were just incredible! I cannot wait to come back and try more of what they have!     It is expensive, but so worth the price point! I hope that you enjoy yourselves when you come or have an event here. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Excellent addition to the Cosmopolitan. Probably doesn't hurt that it generates more revenue than the art gallery it replaced.  I feel this place has more of a focus on the food than some of the other restaurants in this hotel. Some, without naming names, are more about the scene than the food. Luckily for us, Zuma comes through with excellent food.  The skirt steak came with a cool chimichurri sauce that was pretty good. Every dish comes with salt (himalayan?) on the side. Use very carefully, and don't use a lot, doesn't need that much. The robata skewers crushed it, the chicken wings and the beef with shishito pepper were pretty big and full of flavor. Get sushi if you want but I'd focus on their other dishes, like from the robata, skewers, or the bigger plates.  Handcrafted ice and cocktails sitting in barrels are a few of the more inspired drinks on the menu. I overheard a convo the bartender had about sour beers and my ears perked up. He gave me the beer even though they don't sell it and only use it in cocktails. What a nice gesture!  Do not come here expecting just sushi. It's an izakaya! Sushi is there, but it's not the main event. Enjoy the robata grill and the shared plates.",

The New York location was bigger than this one but this location still offered a superb dining experience. The ambiance was excellent! Very dim lights with an open kitchen view and awesome decor. The lighting was perfect for dinner! Our sever was James and he was very helpful and knowledgable. Also good looking haha(eye candy and good food cant go wrong). For an app I got the zuma Churashi roll. It was really tasty. Salmon yellow tail sea bass and tuna .excellent combo. I like to have my sushi with eel sauce, try it!  For a main I ordered the grilled sea bass, which James recommended as one of the best dishes on the menu and boy was he right!! It was absolutely amazing. The combination of flavors was excellent!! The one down fall is that it's a small portion with no sides so if you're hungry I definitely recommend some apps or a side order. My friend got the potato which was excellent as well. There were a lot of different addings and James prepared it for us. So good! I absolutely love this restaurant and if you're in the area you have to try it!! There's so much more they offer ranging from steaks to veggies. Everyone can enjoy this place!",

    "text": "After careful Review of several high end Sushi restaurants we decided to come to Zuma. I was very excited since we walked into the restaurant. Our reservations were at 8 and we were seated by 8:10 so that was t too bad. We requested the sushi bar because they had several seats available and we wanted to get the sushi bar chef experience. Unfortunately aside from the greeting we received when we were seated we never got any eye contact or service from the sushi chef. We just moved on with our night and still had fun. We ordered a nice 300 ml bottle of rocks Saki and we received two shot glasses that were far from clean. Has objects floating inside cup after first pour and it even had some oily residue. You should not expect that when  you go to any restaurant let alone one that you pay $$$ for your dining experience.  The sushi was very good and they brought our meals out quickly with no errors. They deserve a 5 star for quality of food. The Miso soup was average but we didn't go for soup so who cares.  I did order a cappuccino that was pretty watered down with milk and honestly they shouldn't really offer it if they can't make it so make sure to request if you like your cappuccino wet or dry. Desert was awesome and we enjoyed every bite. Only other complaint I had was that service was good but not great for what we paid. A $30 tip was basically at 15% and that was still too much since we didn't really get any attention. You need to remember that my complaint is strictly due to the price we paid for sushi and you pay more for not just the food but entire experience. We weren't the only people annoyed at the sushi bar so they were having some issues tonight.",

Surprisingly, we were stuffed by the end! Unfortunately, Zuma missed the mark on most things though and I wouldn't return.  GREAT: * Scallops - Huge, delicious, amazing scallops. I'd come back for the scallops every day if I could! * Sea Bass - Delicious flavor, on par with the one I tasted at Hakkasan.   GOOD: * Mushroom rice with truffles - Good but pricey for a small bowl! * Sea bass sashimi  * Sorbet dessert - delicious and refreshing!  MEDIOCRE * Steak - A big portion but a little chewy. Don't come here for the steak. * Corn on the cob - Filler course. * Sushi Platter - very hit or miss in quality.   PASS * Lobster tempura - Bland * Potstickers - unique flavor but wouldn't order again.",

My husband and I frequent for birthdays and it's one of our top spots to bring friends from out of town. If you aren't wanting to spend as much, grabbing a seat at the bar, a few of their unique and amazing cocktails, and a few plates to split is also a wonderful experience.   While almost everything here is divine, some of our favorite plates to order are the pork belly skewers, yellowtail and serrano maki roll (spicy and delish), street corn, and the spicy edamame. We've also tried a bunch of their steaks and they are all fantastic.   My favorite cocktail on the strip is also located here. The Lychee Rose Martini. Absolutely amazing, and extremely photogenic. I could drink 5 (although that might end the evening early).   Highly recommend!",

Some of the most popular dishes are the tuna/salmon, the spicy beef tenderloin and the king crab which were all great! The tuna/salmon was very fresh and tasty. There are several pictures on yelp, just keep in mind they look a lot bigger than the real size.   The spicy beef tenderloin was perfectly cooked and very rich on flavors. However, my ultimate favorite was the king crab with lemon ponzu sauce which was just amazing! Every bite made me want even more! The ponzu lemon sauce was amazing! We wanted to dip everything in it!!  Another side dish that I would recommend are the shishito peppers and the shiitake mushrooms.   Although the lobster is a very popular dish I would not bother ordering it again!  Overall, this is a great restaurant to try, you will be happy with the food and the atmosphere!",

Parking: I believe Cosmopolitan parking garage gives you free parking for 90 minutes BUT it's best to walk or Uber/Lyft to Zuma if you're on the strip. A bit of exercise before eating will help you enjoy your food ahaha.  Atmosphere: very fine dining. Elegant decors and restaurant looks upscale. So are other restaurants on the strip lol. Most attires are business to dressy here. Try to dress casually nice y'all.   The food: AMAZING and everything just melt in my mouth. They offer meals tasting or a la carte. We did the a la carte, but I think I would do the meal tasting next time I'm there. You pay a bit more and you get variety. It's also nice to sit right around the open kitchen, so we get to see all the actions of how the food were prepared.   We didn't drink there so I don't know.  Overall: I had a good time there. I would go back and it's fine dining so it's expensive. But you get what you pay for.",

I am already plotting my next visit here to fulfill my curiosity. Every single thing that came out on our table were so delicious and flavorful, my mouth and tummy were having a party for sure! Japanese fusion on another level.",

I also recommend the sea bass and beef dishes. The only thing I would advise is to order the Edamame with less salt. With the amount of salt on those things...I would literally feel my fingers swelling haha For dessert, order the key lime! It's a must!!",

Ordered the yellowtail with pickled garlic. The garlic should be toasted and not pickled.  He said the spinach salad is warm and good. It's actually steamed spinach that comes cold and tastes like peanut butter.  He recommended the skirt steak. It had great flavor yet extremely chewy.

    "text": "This is now one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas! We were able to get reservations on Open Table for our anniversary and were seated promptly when we arrived. Our server, Kim, was great and gave plenty of suggestions on what to try since it was our first time there. We decided on the following:  Piri Karai Edamame - stir fried soybeans with chili, garlic and ginger  Tempura Moriawase - seafood & vegetables   Robata Beef Rib Eye - rib eye steak (12 oz) with chili ponzu (med-rare)  Japanese Grade A5 Wagyu - wagyu beef with tahoon aioli and chili daikon ponzu fresh wasabi (med-rare)  Jagaimo no Marugoto Robata Yaki - roasted potato with shiso butter and sancho lime salt  Chawan Mushi - exotic fruits   Everything was SO good! The tempura came out nice and hot and the prawns tasted very fresh. The rib eye was delicious with some char on the ends and perfectly cooked. The roasted potato was really a big baked potato and our server mashed it up for us tableside with the butter and salt (that's some serious crack butter - it's addicting) but the A5 Wagyu was the star of the night! Our first time eating A5 and it was AMAZING! It was sliced thin and came with three different kinds of salt along with the two sauces to dip in - just melts in your mouth with tons of flavor! The chawan mushi desert was also good and the Happy Anniversary script added a special touch. Can't wait to come back!",

I live close by and dine quite often in the Miami location so I figured I'd give the Vegas location a try.   What I love about Zuma is they just do everything right. The Food is amazing and always consistent. Doesn't matter what you order everything is just so damn flavorful and delicious. Quite honestly I've never had a bad experience. The Food is prepared with high quality ingredients and the execution just flawless. My all time favorite is their black cod, the tuna and salmon tartar, wagyu beef and the sushi. Just Never gets old and I order it all the time.   My experience at the Vegas location was exceptional. The Service and atmosphere was great too 5/5.",

    "text": "So my friends and I decided to go all out and do the Signature OMAKASE for $139 per person. You can also do ala carte and order random items from the menu. Yes, the food here is pricey, but so are many of the other restaurants at the Cosmo.  The quality of the food was great, but what really stood out to me was the presentation of the food/drinks and the ambiance. The kitchen areas are open and the restaurant had lots of dark wood decor.  If I remember correctly, it was a 12 course meal with a special \"birthday\" dessert platter that was huge! I wish I took a picture of it. We were soo full by the end that we didn't even finish all the sweets. Two of the people at our table do not eat meat and they were still able to enjoy the many dishes. There are vegetarian/vegan options on the menu.   All of the food we got was delish, but my 2 favorites were the miso cod which just melts in your mouth and the beef tataki with black truffle. Anything truffle is a winner to me. My japanese old fashioned drink was soo good that I drank 2! They chip off a square piece of ice from a large ice block and then imprint ZUMA on your square ice cube. Service is fast and on point.   All I wanna do is zuma zoom zoom zoom and a boom boom.......go check this place out!",

The decor is beautiful and stylish, with a dark, softly lit interior and ceiling lights above each table (perfect for getting that 'gram =P). Great spot for a special occasion or date night, my friends and I stopped by for dinner before heading to the Celine Dion show.   My group of 3 had the following: - sliced yellowtail, green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic - so fresh and tart with a delicious crunch from the garlic - salmon roll - mixed salad with asparagus, avocado, seaweed and sesame seeds - refreshing and crisp, so good that we ordered a 2nd bowl after finishing the 1st! - grilled scallops with pickled plum, shiso and mentaiko butter - buttery, tender, and delicious - shiitake mushroom with garlic and soy butter - full of umami flavor and super garlicky, luckily we love garlic! - japanese sweetcorn with shiso butter - delicious but messy - jumbo tiger prawn with yuzu pepper - probably my least favorite dish (but only because everything else was so tasty!). The texture of the meat was just a bit too chewy, and may have been slightly overdone. - black cod - wow the absolute highlight of our meal, the fish was so tender and flaky that it melted in our mouthes, and the flavor with the dipping broth was just perfect  Sadly, we had no time (and no room in our stomaches) for dessert, but all in all a great experience!",

    "text": "Zuma was the only restaurant was on my 'must-try' list during my visit to Vegas because one of my friend who travels the world plenty (he's in South Africa as of the date of this review) had told me that Zuma served one of the best steaks that he'd ever had anywhere. Obviously I had to give it a try, right?  I made a reservation to dine here at 6:00 pm. It was an early dinner because I had to go to an event at 8:00 pm. The restaurant was pretty empty around this time so a reservation was definitely not needed. But to be on the safe side, I made it anyway.  Arriving at the restaurant, we were greeted by a super friendly hostess who made conversations about my name before we were taken to our table.  Despite the many empty tables in the restaurant at this time, we were seated next to another couple who were dining in. I usually wouldn't have an issue with this if the distance between tables were pretty far. However, there was probably only about one foot separating the two tables so it felt more like sitting a fast food sitting. If you go through their pictures, you'll see what I mean.  Our waiter came up to our table almost immediately. He explained the menu and was quick to answer any question we had about the menu and also making recommendations of what we should try. Throughout our dining experience, he was friendly, attentive, and on point. No complaints whatsoever about him.  Zuma is pretty much a Tapas restaurant where everything on the menu is small portioned so it allows you to order different menu items to try.  - Spicy lobster miso soup: I didn't try this but my friend thought that the Miso soup was really good. - Sake marinated chicken wings, sea salt and lime: Delicious! One of the better chicken wings that I've had. The marinade definitely got soaked through the chicken. The meat was both crispy and tender. Squeeze the lime on top of the chicken and then dip it in salt and this is a chicken wing you have to try! Highly recommended. - Crispy fried calamari with serrano pepper and lime: Pretty good but it didn't really have the 'wow' factor that would separate it from other high-end restaurants. - Rock shrimp tempura with chili tofu: probably my least favorite dish of the night; it was just okay. Without the dipping sauce, the shrimp tempura tasted kind of bland to me. If you're thinking about trying this, I would recommend against it.  The main course of the night was the Japanese Grade 5 Wagyu Steak. It was marked as 'market price' so we asked our waiter what the market price and it was $33/oz with a minimum 4 oz order. We decided to order the 4 oz to split it between the two of us. At first, we thought that 2 oz each wouldn't be nearly enough and we were contemplating about ordering a rib eye or beef tenderloin, but it's a good thing we didn't. By the time we were done with the other dishes, the 2 oz of steak was plenty enough for each of us.  The steak was served medium rare (just like any steak should be) and was already sliced up to make it easy to share. The steak was cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and buttery in your mouth.  Zuma was the third restaurant where I'd tried Japanese Wagyu steak (Metropolitan Grill in Seattle, Killen's Steakhouse in Pearland) and let me tell you that it was probably as good as, if not better than the others. I mean, I'd have to try all of them side by side to really tell but whatever.  If you've never tried Japanese Wagyu steak, you should. If at all possible, you should try Japanese Wagyu steak side by side with a USDA prime steak so you can really appreciate how much better the Japanese Wagyu is. I wish Zuma had actually made that option available (This option was available at both the Metropolitan Grill and Killen's Steakhouse).  All in all, I enjoyed the majority of my meals. However, due to the price point, I expected every single one of my dish to be mind blowing. This wasn't the case here. I wouldn't mind going back to try some of the other stuff they had on their menu.  P.S. Yes, I know I didn't try any sushi, but I came here specifically for the steak and not the sushi.",

This place also gets super busy, so make sure you make a reservation.   I loved their Wagyu sushi with truffle on top. That was sooo good that I had to order another one, but it was $25 for 2 small pieces. Something about the Wagyu with the crunchy radish rap and the generous slice of truffle on top was an amazing combo. I could of had 10 of these.   Their Alaskan king crab leg was just okay. Their giant grilled prawn was dry and had no flavor.   I loved the miso cod, that was my favorite dish of the night.   The rib eye was just okay as well.   Overall the service was good, atmosphere was cool, but it was very pricey for what you get. Expect to spend at least $300 for 2 people. Each plate was around $40 for what we ordered.",

Although we had made reservations, we were being so well taken care of & having such fun talking to Brian &Jose we decided to eat dinner at the the bar.  Their food recommendations were spot on.  We started off with a BURNING HISTORY cocktail.  The crafting & presentation of the drink was a Vegas show in itself!  Jose filled a glass with smoke from a burning stave from a seasoned from a whiskey barrel.  He then added a hand crafted ice cube, house dehydrated orange, and sun Tori took whiskey shaken with honey, ginger, yuzu, and egg whites.  Delicious!  I would also recommend asking for a Penicillin Shot (not on the menu): Scotch, lemon, fresh ginger, & honey).  Favorites:  SPICY BEEF TENDERLOIN  GIANT PRAWN ROBATA SHITAKE MUSHROOMS PORK BELLY SKEWER  You can't beat the great service, the positive energy, the fresh flavors and quality foods at Zuma.

The place has a nice decoration but the pushy waiter made us just want to finished our 2 rolls and leave. We had appetizers and drinks as well, and I would have order more but I was tired of how rude the server was. They had a tasting kind of option but it wasn't vegetarian so we decided to go a la cart and I think that was the waiters problem when we decided the fixed price menu was not for us. Find better places. Not your place to go.",

    "text": "Everything is bigger and better in Vegas right?   Well if you take the True spirit of an Izakaya (simple tasty dishes to make you drink more and relax) and amped it up 3 levels and tripled the price then Zumba fits right in.   First atmospherics, the custom groove music playlist perfectly volume synced to the crowd buzz level? Check.  Ample service team running around supervised by aloof/hipster floor managers? Yup.  High end dining room dark enough so you can't read the menu prices? That's the plan.  And most important a beehive of customers shelling out American moolah by the Ben Franklins. That's the whole idea.   I must say that besides good food and on point service, the most important part of creating a great dining experience is You!  And a lot more beautiful people like you!   The energy in a dining room comes from the customers who animate and fill the place with buzz.  That's the magic elusive ingredient that blends and masks everything to a smooth endorphin feeling meal.  Ok, so Zuma got all of that in spades.  Food.   Above average sushi bar.  Once you got two choices for Toro (chuu and oo) you know they got the Chefs and suppliers from the A level to make almost everything.  Another markers is Japanese uni (Hokkaido) vs. the us west coast version.  Smaller darker gonads that are more sweeter and intense without the funkiness than their bigger American cousins.   So give the sushi bar a A-.  What's missing is 4-5 unique kinds of fish or shellfish.  They did have kimidai which is a kind of snapper and their scallops are from Hokkaido so they do get points.  Kitchen does a great job with a wide and diverse menu.   Mixing Robata, tempura and hot dishes in with the usual high end starters.  As others have said, kind of riffs on Morimoto or Nobu signature dishes.  Nothing super new and I personally did not like the basil/shiso flavoring of their creamier gratin dishes.  Miso Porkbelly skewers did stand out in my mind.  Also the giant grilled prawn a better choice than the lobster.  Another A-.   At this price and execution level you can't really go wrong with any dish.   Bar. Now here they get a solid A!   Very creative and eclectic menu for cocktails.  Got to get the Burning History.  Kind of a Japanese whisky sour complete with torched MaCallan whisky stave.   And hand chipped clear ice to boot!  This was done well and at tableside for the ohhh factor.  Another one is the fish in the bag gin tonic presentation.  Winna! So if you got some cash to burn it's better to waste it here than lose it on the first floor.   At least you will have a full tummy and a great fun memory.  All you get downstairs is regrets!",

The food was not only beautifully presented but delicious. There was not a single bad item. Everything was so good, but I would definitely recommend the skewers and dessert. If nothing else, get the lava cake and custard dessert. I've never had a more delicious lava cake... it was probably the best I've ever had any where. The custard was so amazing with the matching fruit puree. Just thinking about it makes me drool.   The service was also amazing. They really want you to have a wonderful experience and work to accommodate all your requests (even adjusting the air to reduce draft to the table).   This restaurant definitely shot to the top of my restaurant list and would recommend to anyone looking for an amazing dining experience accompanied by melt in your mouth food!",

Great selection of alkie mostly anything with whiskey they have a great selection of Japanese whiskey.  as for the food great spot for veggie options i loved every single one the shitake mushrooms and the fried tofu with avocado salad are my faves the asparagus skewer is good  but whatever u do dont order the seafood veggie tempura unless u dont mind having that last it took about 1.5hrs to get it just be warned it is good once it comes out but not worth the wait.   the salmon and fat tuna tar tar is great when u scoop it and put it on the nori shirmp rice crackers . and if u like to be adventurous try the uni my fiance said it was one of the best unis she's had because it didnt have that slimy after taste. regular bar service great sushi bar service was meh seems like ur not on priority of service like i felt i was out of site out of mind. but great spot for music with good veggie options 2 out of 5 first time i ate it was a high 4 but with the how long it took for the tempura to come out i averaged out the 2 Nd 4 to a 3  let's start off with the alkie the best selection of jap",

All of the cocktails feature their hand cut/crushed crystal clear ice! (Not to mention fresh fruits and herbs with top shelf liquor)   After having a few drinks at the bar, we were escorted to our table. They easily transferred our bar tab to our table which was very convenient and quick.   We started with edamame and shishito peppers which were both phenomenal and then moved on to sole Sake and sushi.   Finished off with their Ribeye steak which was served sliced in a modern Japanese fashion with seat salt and house made wasabi. This was honestly one of the best steaks I've ever had!   Everything Zuma does, they do it 110% - Amazing chefs, high quality ingredients and attention to every detail. 5 stars for Zuma, we can't wait to go back!",

We noticed the lamb actually medium rare. We informed our waiter about that the lamb should be fully cooked.  Our waiter took the plate and talked to the manager. Moments later, the lamb came back to us when we almost already for the desert.   At this time, the lamb is fully cooked; however, they used the same piece of the lamb that was originally served to us in the first place. I understand that it makes sense not to waste the food by getting a new piece of the lamb for us. But, for a 5 star restaurant, I would expect that the would be on top of their service and I expected to receive a good experience from them. The worst part is, no one ever apologizes to us about the mistake, and the food never comps for.   We went to a less expensive restaurant on the strip before, and they would give comp a meal to us when a mistake like this happens.   Our bill was about $350. They served us a used lamb at a 5 start restaurant, and no one seems to care including the manager.",

Seriously if you want to charge $20 for 2 pieces of sashimi/sushi I think it's just ridiculous.

Drinks: all delicious  Shots: green tea shot & kamakazi- more cocktail style so u can even sip on it in my case.   Burning history: must get!!!! The smoked cedar wood in front of you. Then fill the glass with the smoke: add large ice cube and a dried candies citrus and the drink. It's so delicious and you can smell the Yuzu and cedar. I was so impressed especially thAt it tasted DELICIOUS    Tapas/ dishes Caviar and champagne: good enough for 4 to share. Came with variety of condiments and cracker. Good but not my fave. Champagne was enough for 1/2 glass for 4 or full glass for 2.   Edamame was regular so don't order.   Grilled pepper: decent but didn't care too much for it.   Octopus: tender can order sashimi style or with rice. We did both. But ate before I got the pic.   Rib eye steak with garlic chips : already cut up. Good flavors and very tender. Garlic chips are delicious and complimentary in flavor and texture   Soft shell crab: so good with the sauce. One of the better places with soft shell crab slightly battered and fried.   Pork belly: I know it's fatty but it was so good and melted in your mouth. Must try if u eat pork. The sauce that it came with was perfectly complimentary in flavor to offset the fatty taste.   Asparagus: Al dente the way I like it. I just needed some veggies  Sea bass carpaccio: take the fish eggs and put some in the sea bass and eat it with the micro greens. Good flavors and texture.   The picture of the dessert was not ours but a nearby table. But it looked so good that I couldn't resist asking for a pic. We were so stuffed with food and drinks and in time crunch so we didn't order more.   Must try!!!!",

My boyfriend and I went with another couple, we all love to eat and try different things so we decided to order a bunch of stuff for the table.  Shishito peppers and yellow tail sashimi, pot stickers, steak, fish, two sushi rolls, two desserts and four drinks later, our bellies were satisfied and happy!  A little on the expensive side but totally worth the splurge, You only live once after all!!  The only thing I would change is that is suuuuuper loud in there, hard to enjoy dinner with friends when you can't have a conversation, if it wasn't so loud last night we would have probably stayed longer and have more drinks.",

Especially, the Smokey cocktail was the best one ever I had. They torched the wood by the table and make fresh cocktail in front of you.   Ordered several appetizers and sushi to share. You must try spicy tuna and salmon tar tar! That was so creamy and melt in your mouth.  Our server was very attentive and professional. She recommended us the specialty roll and it was delicious. Overall I really liked their cocktail and definitely come back to try again.",

    "text": "My photos will not tell you anything you do not already know.  The review by Mi S perfectly describes the portions and pricing model which is somewhat expected at any high rent/high tourist location.  The service here is outstanding.  The food is generally tasty.  It is a four star establishment based on the location factors the owner must deal with, the overall quality of the food, and the very responsive service.  Why a single star?  EASY - the policy at a place like this to not be able to make a simple, custom roll is absurd.  You can see I have many reviews from sushi joints and have never been denied this standard request:  *  Inside please put Saki, Hamachi, Crab, and Avocado. *  Outside please put Eel with light Unagi sauce.  Response from waitress \"We don't do that.\"  \"Our chefs can only remove ingredients from what is on the menu but not add or make anything special.\"  I asked \"why?\"  Response \"They just don't like to do that.\"  What happened to \"the customer is king\" or \"the customer is always right.\"    When paying the prices for this place, I would think they could take simple roll order, slap a $35 dollar cost to it, and JUST MAKE IT.  But no, it is easier to not give the people ACTUALLY EATING THE DINNER what they want.  First time I have put all caps in a review, sorry but so limiting from wanting to make people spend big $$$.  My bill was still $550 for only three people by the way.  Poor policy, especially for what is supposed to be a \"nice\" place.",

I hate when servers try to sell you the highest costing items to drive the bill up.  Our server did the opposite.  She asked us what we liked and then helped us navigate what to get.  It was also my friends birthday and literally EVERYONE came by to wish her a happy birthday.  She even got it while we were walking out.  If that doesn't make you feel special and appreciated, I don't know what will.  The food here is incredible.  Perfect flavor balances with fresh, high quality ingredients.  I thought it was priced fairly well for a sushi spot on the Strip as well.    The cocktails... I want to come back (and have to spend the night btw) to try every single cocktail.  The mixologist here is a magician.    I CANNOT wait to come back and experience this amazing restaurant again.",

Restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel on the 3rd floor. Place is pretty sleek and fancy. They do have three areas where the foods are being prepared. They have a sushi bar with seating and a yakatori/grill bar with seating as well. We were sat at the yakatori bar and got to watch all the action. Pretty neat watching all the meats and veggies being cooked.   We were press for time so didn't get to order as many dishes as we would like. We did order two rolls, soft shell and fattie tuna as well as the grill cod. Sushi rolls are your traditional typical rolls. The black cod was a bit fishy, but otherwise flaky and buttery. They do have a huge sake selection. Our waiter was very friendly and welcoming. He was kind enough to give us sampling of the sake before ordering. Overall, place was ehhhh ok, but for the price I would rather spend it somewhere else.",

I tried so many different things- from tempura crab to various sashimis, to rolls, to massive scallops to juicy steak!   It was definitely too much food, but we were warned and slowed down, literally just tasting the last few dishes. Everything was so delicious, especially the sashimi, and the service was outstanding! We were recommended things, the ace was slowed down when we were getting full, and since we were celebrating my husband's promotion, the dessert came with a congratulatory note!   Wow, I would totally come back here again, omakase or otherwise!",

This place didn't disappoint. We think it's better than Morimoto.   Ambience is cool. Noise level is just right.  Service is excellent. Timing of food coming out is about right. Per recommendation, 3-4 tapas per person to share. I would say 3 is perfect per person. Server might push to order double but best just one order and try more selection.   Drinks were amazing.  Ask server for off the menu drinks like Pasion fruit martini with spice.  We enjoyed our mai tai and lychee martini. They have a good selection of Japanese whiskey.   My son enjoyed his nigiri selection of salmon, fatty tuna, and yellowtail.  We loved the yellowtail sashimi.  The waygu beef sushi with truffle is spot on.   We settled with the 14 oz ribeye- cooked perfectly with dipping sauce. I would say if you like pork belly- you must get the Kurabuto pork belly. Scallop skewer was excellent.    Every dish we got was really good. No regrets. Dimsum/potsticker, Alaskan king crab, spinach salad with sesame dressing, shiitake mushrooms, and corn.    Make room for dessert- each one that we got was delicious and perfect ending to the meal.   I would definitely come back and recommend this place to our friends either for a meal, dessert or drinks only.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been coming to Zuma since it opened, about 2 years ago. We come here for birthday, celebratory and business dinners, anywhere from 1 to 3 dinners per month. We usually order many items to share, as the portions are small, like tapas. The prices have have increased over the years, which is to be expected. What I didn't expect was the portion size, particularly the black cod, to decrease so much. At first I thought we were just getting unlucky pieces, but then during the last few dinners, several different people mentioned this. My husband said he usually orders the same items for his business dinners, but last time he had to order extra for the same group of people.  I came here with my in-laws for the first time this past Thursday, and I was just embarrassed. We weren't hungry, but I wanted them to try a few of the popular items. The black cod serving was so small! I wish I took a picture, but I think I was just in shock. It must also have been too salty for them because they wanted white rice. The seafood and vegetable tempura was good but also smaller than previously ordered. The dumplings and mushroom rice hot pot were okay. The skimping of the food is starting to give the restaurant a cheap feel. The sushi on the other hand was fantastic. The dynamite spider roll, toro and hamachi with fresh wasabi were perfect. The server was nice, although we felt like we were always looking for her. Other staff was around to accommodate us. I think we're starting to feel a little bit more disappointed every time we eat here.",

Awesome service, delicious food, great food setting, drinks was amazing, the best desserts!! Very right atmosphere and music! Price was not crazy! It was plusher to be there! I really recommend it! Thank you so much for our experience! Much love, we will come back!",

    "text": "So the first time I went to this restaurant I was with a party of four and we walked out before ordering.  The waitress was trying hard to explain to us that  all of the plates were very small (she motioned to the size of the palm of her hand) and we would need at least 4-5  dishes or more per person.  She could not give suggestions and quite frankly seemed to be new and unsure of what to say. We were all very confused.  Had we stayed and done that and ordered  drinks our bill would have totaled well in excess of $1000.  We often splurge on expensive dinners, but this just seemed a bit much.   After leaving I looked up the reviews and found that  this place got very high marks.  I decided to give it a second chance the following night with my daughter because of what I read.  Totally different experience from start to finish.  To start, our server was wonderful.  He gave us a history of the place, walked us through the menu, told us what types of dishes to try, and was very attentive.  We ended up ordering a total of five dishes plus dessert and left full.     Here is a breakdown of what we had-    We started off with the Prawn and Black Cod Dumplings,  which were very good. My daughter loved them and although I liked them they were my least favorite out of all that we ordered.  Next we had Seared Salmon with Shisho and lime juice.  The salmon was so citrusy and flavorful that we savored every bite.   We also had the sliced yellowtail with green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic.  Another dish done to perfection.  The yellowtail was fresh and butter-like and the chili relish and garlic gave it a nice kick.  Following this we had a specialty roll off the sushi menu- yellowtail with Serrano Pepper, avocado and spicy wasabi. Each bite size piece burst with spicy flavor.    For our entree we shared the Saikyo Miso marinated Black Cod wrapped in a Hoba Leaf.  It was cooked perfectly- a very light and fluffy fish just wonderfully prepared.    For dessert we had a chocolate souffle with a hazelnut filling.  The size was small but just enough for us to share, a nice twist on a classic dessert.  I have to say I am glad we went back.  Yes the restaurant  is pricey (we still spent a couple hundred or so on this one) but I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Everything we had was original, prepared perfectly and delicious. And there was so much more on the menu I would have liked to have tried. I will definitely return the next time I am in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Really much more than a sushi bar, a hip high energy hang out where you may dine.  We sat at the bar, where you may observe the chefs in action to the backdrop of high energy background music that beats through the joint, but your food is served from behind you - there is a glass barrier in fact between you and the chefs and no food is passed to you directly from them.  It is very entertaining though to watch the precision work as the chefs dice slice and arrange meticulously each dish.  Most everything is izakaya style, meaning - meant to be shared.  One caveat - don't go hungry expecting just a couple of dishes to fill you.  You'll need at least three each to dine heartily, and that will set you back a good sum.  This night we had the thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, truffle and salmon roe; fried softshell crab with wasabi mayonnaise; roasted lobster (1 1/2 lb) with shiso ponzu butter and tiger prawn tempura.  Our neighbors (we did not know them but started to converse with them) ended up sharing their rice hot pot with wild mushrooms, japanese vegetables, black truffle with us.  Everything was excellent, especially the lobster.  The lobster was meaty and bursting with rich flavor.  Softshell crab was crisp and fresh tasting, even though it must be frozen, since we are not in Japan.  Everything was fresh tasting.  As far as truffles you could definitely taste these in the \"woody\" rice pot, but less so in the seabass sashimi.  No matter what else you order, I would recommend definitely the rice pot as a side dish.  All in all a great experience, and worth trying.  Only downside we experienced were the hostesses, they were friendly enough but too busy giggling and conversing among themselves to provide good service (i.e. getting us through the wait list and to our table efficiently, they failed in this regards).  Our waiter on the other hand was serious about his job, and attentive.",

    "text": "Wow o wow. This place has some great combos. We got the lychee martini, the earthy gin martini, the spicy fried tofu avocado and Japanese greens, the roasted baked potato with shiso butter and sansho lime salt and the pear mint and strawberry rose sorbet.   The martinis were made to a perfection.  I got exactly what I was hoping for - light refreshing and strong!  The desserts also mixed to be a bit herby but just enough sweetness to say you treat yo self!  The do not miss entrees: the spicy tofu salad is a MUST in fact I went back the next day to eat it again. They marinate the tofu in miso broth, sesame oil and a few other things then perfectly fry the tofu. The tofu is served HOT paired with a cold salad of avocado and greens on top of a house made dressing. This.. is seriously a do not miss. In my two times at Zuma we got and ate 3 plates to the last drop of green.   The roasted potato is fire roasted and the potato is mix and chopped up in front of you- amazing spices and quite the experience.  This blows all other baked potatoes out of the water.   It's a great spot, beautiful interior and the food is served to a perfection.  Alex our waiter did an amazing job too - he was cheerful, sweet and so patient. He throughly answered all of our questions.",

I loved the salmon teriyaki. They should an hamachi collar too.   The nigiri is sort of blah since the Shari is not as tasty as other sushi-ya's.   The sashimi however is very good and presented well. They have fresh wasabi that they will grate if you ask for it. I enjoyed their toro and salmon toro in particular.   Zuma has surprisingly good salads with creative dressings and bright greens. I enjoyed the edamame too with the big, chunky salt grains.   Service is prompt, professional and polite. Water and wine glasses are always refilled. The overall vibe is sophisticated and high end.",

Their dishes come from 3 kitchens - main kitchen, sushi and the robata grill. I recommend ordering from all 3 and sharing the dishes.   Food was pretty flavorful and presentation was good. Standouts were the black cod and sea bass sashimi.  My biggest gripe was that the dishes took a LONG time to arrive and they came one by one. By the time we finished one plate, we waited a long time for the next. Portions are small, so it's pretty easy to go through one dish.",

The kitchen is an open kitchen in the center of the restaurant so I was a little worried we'd walk out smelling like char-broil, but that exhaust vent over the hot coals grill did the trick and you don't even smell the food cooking AT ALL so no worries about having to re-wash your hair to de-stink.     Food is served tapas style and delivered as it is ready.  We were looking for a relaxing, celebration dinner so this style of dining was perfect for us.  We spent 2 hours at dinner.  Service was spectacular and the management team was visible and attentive to every table.  And I'm talking more than just the fly-by, \"everything good?\" you sometimes experience in chain restaurants.    Ken was our waiter....ask for him....you won't be disappointed!!     It's not what I would describe as \"intimate\" dining exactly because the music is techno-peppy, but the lighting is fairly low, we didn't feel crowded up on other tables and it wasn't loud so table conversation was definitely do-able.    Go a little earlier (before 8) and it's even quieter....crowd definitely picked up starting around 8ish and so did the noise level a bit.",

The green yoga mock tail was excellent - was a bit sour and very refreshing. The hochicko and Norisan were also pretty good. The food on the other hand wasn't too memorable. The glazed ribs were ok in flavor but weren't very tender. The mushroom hot pot was pretty bland - mushrooms had a nice texture and it was light, but it lacked in flavor overall.

    "text": "Zuma Sushi inside the Cosmo is-- if not the best-- one of the best dining spots in Vegas.  It has one of the most amazing sushi I've ever tried and the ambience is perfect.  If you're looking for the ultimate Vegas experience or to celebrate something special, I recommend this spot!   I first went to Zuma for my bachelorette/30th birthday with a group of about 7 girls and we were instantly greeted with a smile and professionalism. They sat is in one of the nicest booths with a mirror background where my sister got a kick out of taking selfies after selfies:). The highlight: THE PASSION FRUIT ON A SHOTGLASS. The bartender introduced us to this and comp'ed for the purpose of celebration.  It is the best drink I've ever had I'd vegas! It has a picture-perfect presentation and I recommend it to any girl!  I went back to Zuma for a weekend with my husband.  He was impressed and it isn't easy to impress him since he is in the customer service business with high expectations. He has the best drink of his life there-- THE HISTORY BURN (or the like). Jose at the bar took good care of us and would like to say Vegas needs more bartenders like him! I recommend this spot for a romantic dinner, a girls night-out, or for some fun with a group of friends prior to a club! Usually people are dressed up here, but it is very welcoming even if you decide you'd rather go casually dressed or laid back-- I've seen both. Bringing my parents next!",

    "text": "If PF Chang is your idea of Chinese food, you'll love this Japanese version.  Heavily Americanized, contemporary interpretation of Japanese cuisine prettied up and priced for the Vegas Strip.  The concept isn't new.  Essentially a copy cat of Nobu or Morimoto's.  Navigate the menu carefully and the quality may surprise you.  Straight up, this is NOT a sushi bar, skip the sashimi and sushi.  The fish is of average quality and masked by sauces.  The hamachi topped with green chili relish and sitting in ponzu was totally overpowered, all the subtle sweetness of the fish lost.  Rolls look like it was the \"chef's\" first try at making them.   Uneven thickness, fillings not centered, sliced at odd angles and formed with different amounts of pressure so some pieces are densely packed and others fall apart.  The flavor of the dynamite spider roll (soft shell crab) was nothing special.    Tip:   Dishes are meant to be shared.    The signature roasted lobster with shiso ponzu butter is very good.  Perfectly cooked, still translucent on the inside, cold water lobster with a hollandaise like butter sauce.  The more delicate flavor of ponzu blended with the herbaceous shiso greatly enhance the sweetness of the flesh.  A similar \"sauce\" is used with the charcoal grilled king crab leg with ponzu lime butter with equal success.  Continuing with grilled items, the jumbo tiger prawn (U2 - U4 size) shell split to expose the flesh for grilling, excellent especially when finished with yuzu pepper.  The aroma from the pepper brings it to life.  The crisp grilled branzino fillet with burnt tomato ginger relish also fantastic.  Crispy skin, flaky flesh bordering on over cooked but who cares, isn't that how grilled fish should be?  The bitterness of the burnt areas blend very well with spicy ginger relish.  Finally, the lobster tempura.  Very good.  Spot on cooking to keep the very bland batter crisp but the inside tender and juicy.  The spicy ponzu cuts through the oily finish and brightens up the lobster.  The wasabi mayo, somewhat cloying but good wasabi kick.  Lots of craft cocktails, OK sake, wine, and beer.  The bold flavors of the dishes pair with anything.  High resort markup.  Good service but there is still some clumsiness when explaining menu items.  Overall, not bad.",

    "text": "Zuma I love you, zuma I dooo..  But for real, so good it's ridiculous. I feel like we spoiled ourselves to pretty much every other sushi place ever because this is just top notch quality. Your taste buds will sing  praises, your wallet will cry. But WORTH!   Note: portions are minuscule! It is basically like tapas but smaller. Example, I ordered the king crab and it was I believe 42$ and what came was about 2 ounces of meat, with a finger licking butter sauce. If you can afford to pay to get teased , go for it, if not , skip that plate as it was crazy how small it was lol, that said - I would eat it again and again and again?   The semi fatty tuna and salmon nigiri  I still have dreams about it. The ribs literally fell off the bone, delicious would be an insult.   Only thing I didn't like was salmon and tuna tartar, not the actual fish as it was yummy but it was accompanied by rice cakes to use as dipping things and the tastes just clashed.   Talking about accompaniments, use and eat everything that comes with it, it's meant that way! Except the rice crackers lol. Example, lime came with ribs , squeezed it all over the ribs and they were elevated in taste.   Soft shell crab was amazing and came with wasabi mayo which is best mayo.   How to get here? Go to the cosmopolitan hotel, park in self parking and go near the area with signs for Boulevard Tower Elevators and park there ! There's signs so you know what floor the restaurant is on and you exit the elevator super close by so easy to get to and don't have to walk across entire casino if that is a factor.   Super comfortable bar seating, they have both high and low chairs!",

    "text": "We decided to try this place out for our anniversary trip. I made the reservation about 3 months in advance and when I made the reservation i asked if we could get a booth, to be closer and more intimate setting. I was told they could definitely do that. When we checked in 15 minutes before, nothing was brought up. Then when the place opened, another hostess told us they could not honor our request for a booth because it was a full house? We were the only ones there and only about half full by the time we left, but ok. They offered us the lounge seating, but we had to be out quickly. We decided to just do a table top, and since no one was there, it was still comfortable for us. The cocktail the waitress recommended to us was great, but the girl who brought us the drink spilt some of it on my wife's purse. They cleaned it up. When ordering we had 4 items we wanted from their active menu, and we find out only 2/4 of those items were available. The bone in rib eye with truffles, no truffles were being cut that night she said. The sweet corn with butter, don't have any she said. So, that was disappointing. The final thing that really bugged me, was customer service. When we had an item come out, I had no silverware, and could not find my server nearby. She was talking to two other coworkers in a back corner. I waited about 10 minutes trying to find someone to ask for silverware before a busser came by and asked if he could bring me silverware.   Overall the food was really good, but the service and lack of items available made the anniversary dinner not a great experience, and probably the most unfavorable restaurant experience in Vegas we have been to. Would I come back, maybe. Would I recommend, yes because of the food.",

The sad thing is we met the marketing team for the place right before we ate and had a great first impression, then it went downhill from there.   They missed an app from one of us and then served raw branzino and made out like it was no big deal that he would just take it off the bill.....and then he didn't. Too bad the service is bad cause the ambiance is pretty good.",

Each dish just came out one after the other-- just when we were about to finish something, another dish popped up. I would say, a tiny place to improve is the sauce for the tempura, it needed something more to it like a spice, sweetness, or acidity.   I like how the staff are dressed in black, zip around and get things done. The seating staff, waiters and waitresses, as well as chefs and busing staff coordinated really well. I saw managers/guys in suits help set tables, everyone was busy and getting something done.",

Lychee cocktail, on the other paw...it actually had no taste, though a sweetness lingered in my mouth like a bad cold.

The spices beef and the ginger Kim king crab was our favorite.",

Service from Lisa was very nice , and the menu was a beautiful creation of traditional Japanese flavors and cooking styles. Served along side the menu was a really tasty list of cocktails, that we sampled the GEISHA CRUSH and the ZUMA MAI TAI from. We each had a couple of those drinks... both very well crafted and balanced.  Working our way down the menu, we sampled things like 'Giamndara To Ebi No Gyoza'..which were prawn and black cod dumplings. So good... there was fresh sushi and sashimi as well. Everything we tried from that list, like the scallops, were so fresh and well prepared.  It's a pricey comparison to some of the local eateries  that offer a similar concept and style as Zuma - (Yonaka comes to mind) - but Zuma has an ambiance, a style,  and a drink list, that are to be sampled if you have a chance.   Until next time ! Happy Eating !",

Got there at 5, party of 1 for the sushi bar, and I was told I had to wait till 530 to be seated. No problem waiting, 530 came around and I was still waiting. I asked if I can be seated and they said not yet. I asked at 540 if I can be seated again and she was lost and confused. I said I'll wait a few more minutes. Everyone here gives you the impression you are lucky to be in this place. The ladies up front could definitely need some additional training on all aspects of patron service and they need to leave their attitude behind as well. I walked out at 550 after wasting 50 minutes waiting for one seat at a sushi bar. What a disappointment,",

Zuma is located on Level 3 of the Boulevard Tower at The Cosmopolitan resort casino and hotel which is a great spot to be. Definitely one of my favorite hotels in the city. We started with the Prawn and Black Cod Dumplings which were terrific definitely one of the best appetizers on the menu. We also tried the Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers which came in a close second place. In 3rd place came the Tempura Assorted Vegetables which were really good. We made these three dishes our appetizers and we had no complaints. For our entrees we ordered the Salmon that had a Teriyaki Kyuri Zoe sauce and sliced pickled cucumber. This dish was middle of the road and up to par but lacked something. I feel like they could do a little better with this dish. The dish that they hit a homerun with was the Kobuta Ribs Yawaraka Nikomi. They are glazed ribs with cashew nut and scallions. They were delicious and everyone at the table was very happy with them, good job Zuma! As far as complaints go my first is that they need to stay open later this is Las Vegas not Utah. Not only is this Las Vegas but the restaurant is located in the Cosmo which is one of the hippest casinos in the city so it's really frustrating that they close the restaurant side at 11 PM the bar doesn't close until midnight but what good is that when you go there for a late dinner and then told that the kitchen is closed down but you could have a drink at the bar. Long story short the kitchen needs to stay open later. The only other complaint that I have is that they need their own Wi-Fi. That's it for now ciao...",

    "text": "Summary: Expensive and not worth the wait or their so - called experience.    We came here around 9:30pm for dinner, party of 2. Prior to this,  I had called the restaurant and they told us that their first open reservation is at 9:45pm. However,  they do have a bar area where it's first come,  first serve and it's usually faster for quick bites. That sounds great,  let's do that bc there was only two of us.  How long can it be,  right? I was horribly wrong. Not only was Zuma crowded,  but their bar area can fit a handful of people.  The tall tables but the bar/ window area are not part of the bar.  Those require reservations.  Okay,  fine.  Might as well wait as we are already here and their escalator was out of service so both elevators had lines to go down.  45 mins went by and we were finally seated in front if the sushi chef.  It smelled like a fish market.  Again,  fine,  as we didn't have reservation.    Now,  for the service and food.  While our server was friendly, he was scattered.  We didn't get hot towels to clean our hands, while others did.  One of our orders were delivered to the wrong table.  And each item took 15-20 mins to come.  We couldn't fully enjoy a dinner as their was a long pause in between.  Furthermore,  for a \"high class\" sushi house, you'd think they'll give you better chopsticks,  right? Nope. Cheap chopsticks that soaked up whatever dish you're eating will carry over onto the next.    As for the food,  hit and misses.  But overall,  not worth the price.  The spicy lobster miso soup had three small pieces of lobsters and the broth tasted like chicken brother with ramen spices; it lacked the miso base. Similarly,  the majority of their dishes were salty or heavily sauced that you can't enjoy the freshness of the seafood.  This defeats the purpose of going to a sushi house.    Overall,  I would not be back and do not suggest eating here as there are so many sushi restaurants on the strip with better quality,  services, and price.",

He said that he couldn't tell the difference in the most expensive from the cheapest to the most expensive. Thats important as we all weren't big sake drinkers so that was honest. The shishito peppers were on point. We had some kind of beef and chicken skewers. The chicken was my favorite as it was juicy and the sauce on it was what made it. The sushi we had was out of this world!",

So here's the setting- Vegas for the weekend with 4 other gals.. been drinking at the tables non stop already and of course we had to gamble big for those \"free\" drinks.  Dinner time comes so we head over to Cosmo for Zuma.  We arrived at Zuma and were seated shortly after, barely a wait. We have all never been to Zuma so we look at the menus intensely and then I go \"Ooohhh let's all go for the OMAKASE, it's random fresh special items\", girls all say . Anywho.. they served all of the items Janice L. took pictures of.. we all thought we were super hungry but by like item number 5 or 6 we were starting to all get full yet we were only half way into it.  The server kept on bringing the goods: sashimi pieces, steaks, jumbo lobster looking prawns, soft shell crab.. man the list keeps on going..... we try.. we really did.. after like the 10 item we flagged down the server and was like.. \"how much more?!?\" Don't get me wrong.. it was all good and fresh items but our spanxs don't expand out that much hahha anywho.. overall, good tasty fresh items but if you order the OMAKASE menu just be prepared.  It was one of the girl's bday so the dessert platter was crazy.. remember to leave room for desserts.   I'm not exaggerating when I say it was a lot of food, one of the gals after dinner couldn't handle it and had to throw up .  Another gal over indulged too much and had the chills/headache and felt like crap where you have to take alka seltzer haha .. those girls and their sensitive stomachs..",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking forward to trying this location after having a fantastic experience at Zuma in Miami Beach a few months ago so the bar was already set at a high level.    The thing that I wanted to note at the beginning was how well this location is managed.  I made a note to compliment the manager on their points of service.  From the servers holding up their walking patterns to make sure that guests were allowed to pass first to just he overall demeanor of everyone, the training is obviously elite here.    Our server was Jasmine and she was on point all night.  She was friendly, helpful and went out of her way to make sure that the night was fun and eventful.  When you are going to be dropping around $300 including tip for two people, you already have high expectations but she was fantastic.  Jacob was also another bartender who we met about halfway through and he was excellent as well.  He even went out of his way after our dinner to offer us a a rum cocktail with two of their custom branded ice cubes that had a nice touch.  The rum was Ron Zacapa and it was a nice way to end the evening.  I started with wine which was my usual \"Go to\" while my wife had the Raspberry Passion Fruit cocktail which she had enjoyed in Miami.  She eventually went with Kiyogi Fizz after Jasmine recommended it and the presentation was off the charts.  This thing was a work of art and also tasted great according to my wife.  Jasmine was mixing, shaking, torching and did everything you could do to make a drink other than ferment the alcohol herself.    As for the food, we started with the Jumbo Tiger Prawn which is a must-have if you ever come here.  Its not just unique, it's also an excellent dish.  We picked it clean in about 5 minutes.  We also enjoyed the Prawn & Black Cod Dumplings.  My wife had wanted to try the Salmon & Tuna Tartare the first time in Miami but we didn't get it so she pushed for it this time around.  It was an interesting and also quite good.    We opted for the 9 Piece Sushi Selection which is always going to be a gamble since you don't know what they will give you.  You can make requests on certain things that you don't want like I did with Sea Urchin and Squid.  Our order included Salmon, Ebi, Sweet Shrimp, Scallop, Golden Eye Snapper(My Favorite), Japanese Mackarel, Yellowtail and Tuna.  The one disappointment that keeps this from being a 5-star is that the sushi was off in some instances.  It had a tap-water taste to it.  It was like it had been washed under a faucet which is not ideal.  It didn't ruin the dish but it definitely could be noticed.  My wife felt the same way and she said that she would not order that particular dish again.     We certainly did not come away disappointed and would recommend Zuma to people coming to Vegas.",

    "text": "I'd dined at Zuma last year during the first weekend of March Madness and came away so impressed that I knew that I had to take my wife here the next time we were both in town.  We had dinner reservations for 6:30 on a Tuesday night, which was likely a good thing because by 7, the place had largely filled up.  We were seated at the robata grill, which offered a great view of delicious looking (and tasting) food being prepared.  Our decision on food was easy based on my previous experience.  We had the Premium Omakase ($178/person, which was a $10 increase since my previous visit).  We received 13 courses; seven of the dishes were the same on both visits, with the new ones likely based on seasonality and availability of ingredients.  I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get the Mushroom Hot Pot this time, which was mind-blowing in its deliciousness despite its simplicity, but all of dishes we received this visit were obviously prepared fresh to order, beautifully presented, generous in portion size, and amazingly satisfying.  Service throughout our meal was attentive and our meal was well-paced/sequenced, which was a feat worth mentioning since our food was coming out of three separate kitchens.  While very pricey, Zuma's omakase game is strong and I highly recommend it as it offers a good cross-section of everything that Zuma offers.  In my opinion, Zuma continues to be the best kept food secret in the Cosmo.",

I promise it will stir up many positive conversations, explode your taste buds with fresh seafood goodness, and make you insanely happy. There's too many tempting things on the menu to only stick to one or two items anyway! Just GET EM ALL! Haha.   It brings you an array of items fresh from the sea such as sashimi, tartar, the most tender juicy beef you'll chew up, fish, prawn, soft shell crab, and so much more that I actually can't even remember so you'll have to see for yourself! Oh and of course they end the course on the BIGGEST sweet note I've ever had in my 23 years of LIFE! Seriously.   A few highlights from their tasting menu shared amongst my lovely group of 6 was the sashimi, a thick piece of incredibly buttery cod (I think it was, I may be wrong, I just remember it was FABULOUS), the tartar mashed up to perfection served with crispy chips, a jumbo prawn that is the biggest piece of shrimp I've ever eaten, meaty soft shell crab served with a creamy wasabi mayo, and the ginormous boat featuring an array of what I believe was all their desserts! One of the gelatos within this dessert boat was red like raspberry but had a strong hint of wasabi, super unique and actually tastes better than it sounds haha. My photos don't even do this justice, please just ORDER IT ALL and experience the Japanese feast for yourselves. I promise you won't be disappointed!",

Our waiter was very helpful with excellent recommendations on what to try.  Our appetizers: prawn & cod dumplings (was so juicy and great flavors), yellowtail sashimi cold plate (excellent), sea bass sashimi (amazing). Our dinner chooses: spicy beef tenderloin (great flavor and cooked perfectly (medium rare), Chilean sea bass (loved the sauce and it was cooked perfectly), side of shitake mushrooms (so delicious). For dessert, we had the mango tart which was excellent as well. Not too heavy and just enough for us to share as we were already stuffed from dinner!  This place is everything we had anticipated and we were just blown away with the food! Great service as well and a beautiful ambience.",

I was a regular at Zuma in London, and when I heard this was opening at Cosmo, I made the first reservation they offered--it was during the holidays, when they opened, a couple years ago. It was incredible!! The staff is professonal and kind, the manager is caring, the chefs are amazing, and the food is a delight for the pallet. I am so grateful this opened and will be going every time I get the chance. Thank you Cosmo!",

We sat at the bar and had a couple drinks while waiting for our table. It was super packed and busy and we waited for a table for two for about 25mins which was fine. Our server was fantastic. We ordered tuna tartar, edamame, beef skewer with shisto pepper (to die for) it only came with two. We also ordered a bottle of sake and wagu steak. FANTASTIC!!! They had a bathroom in the facility which was convenient and it was super clean. This place is a must try if you are visiting Vegas and or staying at Cosmo. I'll be back again soon. Keep up the great work Zuma team :)",

I wanna call this a Nobu minus 1 star :P  Ordered: x crispy fried calamari with green chili and lime - good, but not amazing. hard to fail calamari.  x yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and pickled garlic x kinoko no kama meshi - good again, but no different than most dishes I tried in this style. Better than the one at Nobu IMO. x rice hot pot with wild mushrooms - OMG SO GOOD! This came with a generous portion of truffle shavings and I could actually taste it in the rice after they mixed it up. It's one of their most popular items so ORDER IT. My friend who doesn't even like truffles liked the dish :)  x spicy yellowtail roll with serrano pepper, avocado and wasabi mayo - Loved this roll. Super fresh! x salmon and tuna tartare - reminded me of the one over at Morimoto... very good.  x chicken wings - probably my favorite thing of the night. Super flavorful and tender. Highly recommend this one :) x chicken skewers - just ok x jumbo prawn - This one was SOOOOO good. It tasted like lobster, but BETTER. It was HUGE! MUST ORDER.  x king crab with caviar sushi - light and refreshing, but not worth the price.  x dynamite spider roll w/ soft shell crab - filling roll with lots of soft shell crab. I really like this one.  Everything was really good, but for $145/pp it was a bit steep. I don't mind paying a lot for food, but I thought for what we got it was too expensive. I like Sushi Samba over at Palazzo/Venetian better :P Some of their dishes are mind-blowing!",

We were seated quickly, but literally spent 10 minutes at our table before our server came. She was obviously rushed and appeared to be serving four tables.  We told her we were interested in sushi and a few other dishes as we had eaten earlier.  She seems disappointed we did not order more.  We asked for rice with our sashimi order which felt like a very big deal.  We don't drink so didn't order alcohol. We didn't see our server for the rest of the meal until she asked us if we wanted to order more at the end of the meal.   Very, very subpar for a restaurant at this price point.    Food: beautiful presentation.   Decent flavor.  Microscopic portions.  The 5 piece sashimi was 52$ and was literally the smallest amount of fish I've ever received.   I lived in Japan for 3 years and have literally eaten at hundreds of restaurants.   The soft shell crab app was one small crab with a small serving of arugula.  Again, a single bite.  We also had the seaweed salad which was again good but very small.  We wanted to order more but our server didn't return for a long period of time.   Overall:  nice looking restaurant.  Noisy.  very expensive without the service or food to match.  I would avoid this place and try one of the other places in Vegas.",

My least favorite dish was the seaweed salad, but the bf still liked it. The mushroom hot pot, seabass, and king crab legs were also so delicious. The nigiri was really fresh and tasty as well. I also had a cocktail, no pics of it tho, but it was great as well. I'd definitely come back!",

    "text": "Amazing Experience!  I wasn't sure what to expect before arriving here. Granted, being located at the Cosmopolitan. You're not going to be disappointed. All the restaurants within the resort are all exquisite.   Zuma has the allure of a Trendy Japanese restaurant, the dim lighting adds an ambiance of intimacy. The restaurant is perfect for a date, for groups of friends. The cocktail menu provides many selections. After  help from our waiter I was able to narrow my selection down to a Japanese infused Paloma, I wasn't disappointed. However, it had a more tropical flavor that I expected. Nevertheless, recommend it. I personally prefer drinks on the lighter citrus faire and found the wine spritzer cocktail substituted with brut champagne was more to my liking.  Our waiter was very well rounded when it came to the menu. We ordered the watercress, avocado salad with wasabi and cucumber (flavors are fresh light with a bit of the tangy wasabi pop); thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, truffle, and salmon roe (this was fresh light bursting with flavor); Skirt steak with lime chimichurri (it was really moist tender chimichurri always compliments steak perfectly); Tuna and scallion roll;(excellent a definite must try), Wagyu beef sushi with truffle (another must try), We got a dessert sampler of assorted fruits, gelato, and a surprise cake of the chefs selection. The presentation was everything, the flavor not so much the wow factor. However, after a decadent meal full of flavors the light faire and complements of dessert made sense. So no complaints, top notch service, top notch food, you are at the Cosmopolitan after all.",

    "text": "My current Vegas food obsession.  This installation of this international restaurant family is located in the Cosmopolitan Casino and Hotel. The decor is wood and tree themed with modern contemporary Japanese inspired styling.   Tapas extraordinaire is how I would describe Zumba's menu which boasts delicious small plates of sharables that come out from the kitchen as they become ready.Each dish is beautifully and artfully prepared and presented proudly on the plate like it is modeling for a gourmet magazine. And not only is the food pretty, it tastes great too. My party chowed down on the king crab with ponzu lime butter, sweet corn with shiso butter, shrimp tempura, ell roll, wagyu beef with tahoon aioli and chili daikon ponzu fresh wasabi, and potatoes. Every morsel of each dish was beyond good. Truly a five star fine dining look and taste.   The service was impeccable with 2 servers to a table making sure absolutely nothing was missed. When the servers were not at your table they were perched nearby watching and ready to leap if yu even looked in their direction as if you needed anything.   Zumba is currently my number one pick for places to eat in Vegas. Try it and it just may become yours too!",

I've tried almost everything on the menu and NOTHING FAILS... from the lobster with Yuzu butter to even the skewered chicken with green onion. PER-FECTION. You can call me a food natzi lol jk more of a food addict  lets move on to the sushi, FRESH, light, melts like butttaaaa. But most importantly the ratio of fish to rice is perfect! The rice had the perfect seasoning to compliment the fish. Faves? Uni uni uni! , Chu toro, salmon, &amberjack (baby yellowtail) . Yesterday I ordered something new - the roasted potatoes AND LET ME SAY, it changed the game for potatoes. It Inspired me Tremendously to make my own twist at home. They mix it up for you table side which is always fun! I always eat here every time in Vegas & I don't think I'm gonna stop anytime soon. Watching the chefs work was immaculate. Such a well rounded and runned restaurant. Okay my mouth is watering, I'll see you guys tonight.  Service is great/attentive. If I had to say one thing, I wish there was more bathroom stalls lol and chef can we be friends? I'm an aspiring cook and you motivate me and give me hope that contemporary Asian cuisine is gonna kill it everywhere, I give you the upmost respect",

    "text": "My overall summation: it just wasn't all that. It certainly wasn't bad, but it was definately flat.   We ordered a good selection across the menu. Some items were tastier than others, again: just meh. Flavors off balance. Sauces that didn't make it beyond a chopstick quick taste. Again, not bad, but at that level, Chef should be delivering excitement in every plate, building a joy that warms you up. You float out of the restaurant and remember the time as special.   I hated the table. The location and the furniture itself. Heavy and hard to maneuver in and out. I would have preferred to be in the main dining room to enjoy the Boulevard lights and the open kitchen. Restaurant was slow and they were only seating in front. Had the food been sensational, the service thoughtful, I wouldn't have thought twice about the table I hated.  Zuma falls in with the Nobu, Sushi Roku see and be seen sushi club spots. Zuma is the place for you if you are a restaurant name dropper and you love almost live blogging your meal plate by plate while on an LV weekend. You want something fancy and showy and quintessentially LV.   Again, it was not bad. At this price point, our city has several equivalents that will knock your socks off. And, if you've been to any of them you'll find yourself big time comparing.",

We enjoyed sushi on our recent visit and were delighted to find superior service, outstanding fish and food quality, and prices consistent with many competitors lacking in these key areas.   With this said, I strongly recommend a trip to Zuma as I am sure, like us, you will find it to be a new favorite.",

Basically, you are paying for the service and ambience.. However, the service is just an ok...The hostess I think she was still new, counted the table number loudly. This is very unprofessional... not even has chair assistant.I know I should not use Forbe standard to put at Zuma, my fault. I understand you are still new but at least don't let customer heard it..At the beginning our waiter was really attentive and knowledgeable. When the restaurant started to get busy, he kept asking us if the sushi platter was served or not.. at least 3 times in ten minutes.. the ridiculous thing is.. even the food runner who was carrying the sushi dish, before he put the dish in our table, he asked us \"did you get your sushi dish?\"........our bill came out around $500, we ordered two omakase and some a la carte. Price is average compared other restaurants on the strip. Food was just ok . But the service is very unprofessional.",

    "text": "Omg...I can't even put into words how AMAZING this place is! We came in a couple weeks ago while we were in Vegas after we were craving some sushi, and this place came up when we did a search. We called ahead the day of and were able to get reservations for that evening (the core dinner times were booked up, so we went in at like 8:30pm or so). We did get slightly lost coming here though, only because the Cosmopolitan is huge and there's just a lot going on! We found our way though!  Anyways, the service was great...our water glasses were always full, multiple servers were taking care of us, the dishes were always cleared from us, and everybody was also very knowledgeable of the menu. We had a few questions regarding the food (what certain things were, etc) & our server was able to answer everything no problem!   FOOD:  The food was excellent to say the least. You can definitely tell that this place uses the highest quality, freshest ingredients. One of our favorite dishes we ended up getting was the toro-maki hand roll, which had caviar and variations of toro. The rolls were a bit expensive but it was damn the near the best hand roll I've ever had. There is another roll that we ended up getting that consists of beef waygu tartare and truffle mushroom garnish, but I forget the name of that one. We ended up getting three orders of that particular roll because it was so good.   I would say the only downside to this place is that it's a bit expensive, so if you come here hungry, it would be very easy to spend a lot of money. I guess that's what you get when you go to a restaurant in the cosmopolitan and eat on the strip, though!   We will absolutely be making it a point to come back here for some small bites and drinks next time we are in Vegas!",

At first glance I immediately fell in love with the interior design and textures of this place. I have a thing for dimmed and modern lighting for restaurants so I was easily intrigued.  I came in with the intention of just grabbing some cocktails but ended up ordering some appetizers. Let me just say this place does not mess around.   Definitely try the \"burning history\". I forget the full ingredients but it's a bit of their take on a sour in a way. I was extremely impressed with the presentation - the snifter glass is smoked with a slab of Macallan sherry wood cask, poured in with a handcrafted ice cube and garnished with a orange peel. Truly flawless. It looks just as good as it tastes.   The quality of this restaurant is over the top and will definitely be coming back numerous times.

They used fresh ginger so it made a big difference for us. A bit pricey but well worth it. If you don't like butter this is not for you. A few of the dishes had melted butter poured on top. Definitely need to get my run in this week! They don't tell you ahead time what each tasting menu has to offer. The only difference among them is the more quality meat the more expensive the option. Shrimp v. lobster meat etc. We had a great time and a nice ambience. Their finale item was dessert and it was out of this world!!

But the big question is: Was the food as 5-star worthy as the ambience? Most definitely! My party didn't even have to wait long for our orders, which was surprising given the great amount of visual effort exerted in every dish we received. The rib-eye steak with garlic crisps, though portioned small, was one of the highlights of my dining experience. But every dish we ordered was just as good as it looked. Don't get me started on dessert though, that's a trip I can't explain in words. You must experience it yourself.",

I was told that it would be 20-30 minutes before we could get a table, not a big deal so I left my name and we went to the bar and got a glass of wine. I saw tons of empty tables. At the 40 minute mark I went back and inquired about how long it would be and the hostess said 30 minutes more.  We went to leave and all of the sudden they had a table open. We were seated and asked what type of water we wanted and I said normal house water and I asked to see the wine list. 5 minutes later he came back with the water and the wine list. And the water has warm. Approximately 15 minutes went by and we were ready to order and no waiter to be found. That was the final straw, no matter how good the food may be the service was horrible and we left extremely disappointed.",

    "text": "My husband and I were excited to eat here as a friend highly recommend it. We arrived without a reservation at about 7pm and it was busy. We were told it would be about 30 minutes, which we expected since we arrived without a reservation. We waited in the hall for about 20 and decided it must be getting close so we sat at the bar and had a glass of wine. Once our wine was gone ( probably 20'more minutes) my husband went and inquired about how much longer. We were told 20-30 minutes more which I did not understand because from where we were sitting I could see at least 4 empty tables and space at the sushi bar the whole time so we decided to go else where. As we were walking out the gal said, \"oh I have seating for you now. \" So at about 8pm we were seated at the sushi bar ( mind you the 4 other tables are still open) the waiter gave us the menus and the bar menu and asked what kind of water we desired ( sparkling, bottled or tap). 5 minutes or so later he poured warm tap water in our glasses, found a wine menu for us and left. We sat for another 10 or so minutes after we set down our menus waiting to have our order taken. At 8:25 pm we walked out never to return. Our order was never taken and we never saw our waiter again.  This may be great food but I couldn't tell you since in the hour and a half that we sat there we didn't get to try any of it which makes me sad since I live so close.",

We ordered it after the server recommended it but we had no idea how damn expensive it was! In the end, we all took some leftovers and made sure to get our dollars worth ;) All in all, great food and ambience but a little pricey. Good for an impressive night out!

Started with the yellow tail and sea bass appetizers.  Not spectacular, but certainly very good.   The high point of the meal was the watercress salad - it was truly exceptional.  Most of the main courses were very tasteless, highlighted by the miso cod.  It had virtually no flavor on its own, and with the sauce it was only slightly better.  We didn't even feel the need to finish it, something I never remember doing with any miso cod.  A mushroom side was also suggested, that was so salty, there was no trace of mushroom taste.  We ended with a roll, and very limited flavor, and what flavor was there, was not the greatest.  Also not thrilled at all with the drinks.  Had two martinis - very small pours, and very little alcohol.  Tasted like I was drinking only juice.  We had looked very forward to Zuma opening, as loved Blue Ribbon at Cosmo, and was looking for another choice that rivaled, Nobu, Sushisamba, etc.  Sorry to say Zuma did not even hold a candle to these.  We will not be returning.",

The quality of the sashimi or nigiri wasn't even close to say  kabuto, which is a fraction of the price and gets fish delivered daily from Japan.   Otherwise the meal was good but not spectacular.",

On the other hand they went to other restaurants to find it, so \"A\" for effort? But it took a little long, maybe they could have figured out something else instead, or could have been better prepared, or was getting soy sauce to go not expected at a fancy restaurant, idk?

The back bar has a weird hot/cold balance with a heater on your legs. The staff was pretty slow for a restaurant that was far from packed. After about 15/20 minutes, I ordered several dishes and a glass of wine. The glass of wine showed up halfway through the meal after I reminded the waiter, and the plates came at a snails pace. I had to remind my waiter that I'd ordered two sets of nigiri and a basic roll as a third course. When the rest of the food finally arrived, I was given a sashimi set instead of nigiri. The waiter said \"oh I had sashimi written down,\" apologized, and offered a bowl of rice, but I declined. In terms of quality of food, it was great. However, I would suggest going elsewhere if you're dining alone as it's clear you aren't a priority here.",

We had too many courses to go through each one but what was extraordinary was that each course had a terrific twist which made it special. They turned a baked potato into a culinary work of art. Try the sea bass and asparagus. Just go. Not cheap but worth every penny.",

I like how after you eat they quickly take all the plates and wipe down the table so you're not sitting there talking and drinking with all your plates all over the table. Definitely would recommend and will come back!!",
