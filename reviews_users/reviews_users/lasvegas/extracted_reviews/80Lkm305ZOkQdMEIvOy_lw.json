I had the Thai Asian salad and the flavor was amazing.  Spicy salad with nice chicken on a bed of cold noodles.  Yum!  Husband had very good clam chowder.  Service was excellent-quick and polite.  Would definitely recommend.",

Too many draft beers to mention, and the menu lists the alcohol % if you're into that. I had a couple of Stellas. Mmmm. My hubby and I split a burger and fries/onion rings. Plenty of food for both of us. Fries were home style, with skins on and the onion rings were nice and crunchy. They're served with a tangy, zippy ketchup. Burger was thick and juicy, cooked medium, exactly like I ordered. The service was friendly, fast and helpful. Next time we're back at the MGM Grand, we'll be back.",

Nachos, chicken strips, mac and cheese bites,  a salad served with a bacon corn dog (WHAT?!?), sliders, smores bites, apple cobbler, etc....everything fried or grilled to greasy perfection. My only complaint is that this place ruined my diet. I went in thinking I'd be good...have a salad or something, but the whole menu is naughty, and sooooo tempting that I ended up knuckling under and giving in to the temptation that is TAP!!",

The Main thing was that I went out to the self parking at MGM and my car window was broken, someone had broken in and stole everything.  The MGM grand hotel was very unhelpful given the circumstances, the security had an attitude of \"so what\".  I told the story to the waitress and she mentioned it to the manager and they unexpectedly comped my whole meal, alcohol included.  I would go back to this place anytime I was in vegas definitely because of the kind gesture.  I would however never stay at the MGM grand again and I would only ever valet at any casino after this experience.  I should also note that this happened in a parking lot that I paid for, had security, and cameras.  So if you drive here to go eat at tap I'd suggest valet to be safe",

Don't even get me started on the food -- every single thing we ordered came out hot and cooked to perfection. The onion rings were crispy and the turkey patty was moist and delicious. I could see how clean the kitchen was from my seat in the bar area which is important for someone who runs a restaurant of her own. I know how hard it can be!

We ordered: -Loaded Fries: completely average, nothing special -Philly Cheesesteak sliders: not good. hawaiian roles, dry meat, american cheese, ew. -Chicken fingers: pretty good. I liked the batter on them, it was different -Cheese curds: OMG these were amazing! Very garlic-y! So delicious! Would def want them again! -Friend mac n cheese: pretty good, but not as good as I've had at other places -Reuben sandwich: I didn't try this, but my husband said it was above average  We also got some drinks. My friend got some kind of spiked lemonade of which they said they had to make a new batch of it. It literally took 25 minutes for them to do this which was a bit ridiculous. I didn't think our waitress was very good. She was a bit stand-offish and didn't check on us very often.  This place was overpriced in some aspects. We were going to order the corndog app, but our waitress told us that it only came with 2 corndogs about the length of a finger and it was $15!! WTF!?  IDK. I loved the cheese curds and they had a big menu, but that was pretty much the high light for me. There are so many places to eat at Vegas that I'm not sure I'd spend my time or money here again.",

We looked over the menu and ordered some drinks with some appetizers. To start we had the buffalo wings that were very good. I like me a good saucy wing with a little spice and a good ranch or blue cheese. These wings had it all, they were very good. We also had these cheese balls that were great. Who doesn't like cheese. They were lightly coded with a tasty batter and came with a dipping sauce that was very good. We tore those things up!  For our meals we all had burgers except for my wife. My wife had the Asian chicken salad with some spice. She enjoyed it but come on nothing like having a burger. My burger was great! It came with thick cut bacon, cheese, lettuce and of course a pickle with a side of thick cut fries and a couple Union rings. Burger was cooked perfectly and was nice and juicy. Everyone enjoyed there food and it definitely is a place to go back to.  The staff was nice and friendly and very accommodating. The decor of the place is cool too. Very big and wide open with memorabilia hanging on the walls and can't forget the ice cold beer. If around the area in Vegas and looking to have some food or even a drink check this place out.",

    "text": "Come when they're NOT busy- I brought a party of 14 here on a Tuesday night. Service was good but the food needed help. I went around to make sure each of my guests were enjoying their meal. When I asked how it was I got a resounding \"just okay\" with shoulders being shrugged. I was a little embarrassed to say the least.  Personally I ordered the little phillies. I wanted to try these as I saw some of the pictures with the melted cheese and succulent beef. Cheese wasn't melted and far from awesome is how I would describe it. I did make mention to the waitress who brought me out some extra hot Cheese. Thank you! Second trip- Thursday, when they opened at 11am of the same week. The place was not busy and I explained to the waitress of my last visit and asked to speak to a manager (he never came out). I ordered the Cajun turkey and my friend ordered a burger. This time around they hit the mark! Awesomeness in both choices! So I conclude that when they are very busy at night their kitchen is probably overwhelmed, they are rushed and the food quality suffers. Needless to say, this place is popular, crowded, and a lot of fun! Just throw caution on your food orders.",

When Mr. Hangover accidentally doused them with salt instead of pepper, they were replaced with an even larger order.  Welcoming and genuine staff! It was full at lunch, but still seated near a casino view window.  I love how it replaced the legacy and creepy lion exhibit. Less kids and tourist. Free the caged animals!  Important..... The VIBE. For a sports bar it was  comfortable with lots of handsome men. And great lighting!  No freaking 100 page menu!  NEEDED IMPROVEMENT  Should advertise more.",

    "text": "My brother wanted to check out TAP and he had comps, so we met him for lunch during the weekend. We shared some starters and had our own entrees. The portions are pretty generous, so it was difficult to finish everything.   Wisconsin Fried Cheese ($10): These are beer-battered and were surprisingly delightful. Served with their ranch dip.  Jalapeno Corn Dogs ($13): The menu said the housemade frank would be filled with jalapeno cheese, but there was oddly NO cheese. They were still okay. I really liked the Honey Blonde Beer Mustard served with it. There was also Spicy Brown Mustard, meh.  Frank in a Blanket ($10): Large housemade all-pork frank wrapped in a flaky pastry and served with that same delicious Honey Blonde Beer Mustard. The frank is a little boring without any kick or standout flavors. I also would have liked more pastry, but it was still nice.  Bratwurst Sandwich ($12): Housemade bratwurst, kraut, spicy brown mustard, and pretzel roll. This was just okay. I didn't care for their bratwurst; nothing exciting.  Porchetta Pork Sandwich ($16): Pork belly porchetta, spicy Georgia BBQ sauce, Kentucky-style slaw, on a pretzel bun. This was a good sandwich; the pork belly was nice. My brother opted for their beer-battered onion rings which were very crunchy and delicious!  Signature Fries ($7): These herbed housemade fries were yummy and I loved their special ketchup.   Green Caesar Salad ($14): Romaine, Parmesan, crispy anchovies, egg, grilled chicken, and roasted garlic green herb dressing. I feel like it's always a gamble with salads at bars, so I was very happy with the salad. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was nice. Solid choice.  Fried S'mores ($6): Fried graham cracker exterior with melted marshmallow and chocolate inside. Served with dipping chocolate. I did not care for them. The marshmallow didn't seem so marshmallow-y and the exterior didn't taste like graham cracker or a decent replacement.  Service started out really great with consistent refills and check-ups. As the restaurant filled up, no one came around and it took a great effort to get anyone's attention. For this reason, it took over 30 minutes between trying to order dessert and getting the check settled.  Overall, the food was better than I expected, but nothing magical. I like that they're making a lot of things in-house and it's definitely more effort than your typical bar food. I really did like their cheese curds and onion rings, but these are not items I'm seeking on a regular basis. A return visit is unlikely for me.",

    "text": "At MGM for a convention and stopped in for lunch a bit before noon. A short line was forming outside and someone in the line directed us to check in at the hostess station. When I did, she re-directed me to get back in line and she will come and take our names. The line continued to form behind us and she stayed behind the hostess desk ??? A party passed us all and asked if bar seating was first come/first served and the hostess said \"yes\" so we immediately jumped out of the line and went in search of a seat around the bar.    It's a square bar and many of the seats were taken but we were able to find two in the back in front of the kitchen.  It took one of the bartenders/our waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge us and ask for our drink orders.  They were busy but being acknowledged is HUGE for me.  We opted for water and since we had 10 minutes to mull over the menu, we already selected our lunch choices:  Build A Burger with grilled chicken on ciabatta, fries, mayo and the lettuce/tomato that comes with it and the Spicy Asian Chicken salad with the dressing on the side.   Tap water for drinks.  It took about 15 minutes for our lunches to arrive. The Chicken Salad was huge, just the right amount of spice but the chicken was rather dry.  Same for the hubby's chicken sandwich.  Fries were thick cut, hot but pretty salty.    The most strange experience is our waiter presented our check BEFORE the lunches came and before asking if we wanted anything else AND then he came back about 5 minutes after he presented the check and said \"can you take care of this now\"?   We've NEVER had anyone at a sit-down restaurant ask if we would pay our tab (especially at the bar) before our meals came and then ask again before the meals came.  That was a real turn-off for me regardless of the quality of the food so hence my 2 star review...plus the dry chicken.    Overall tab with tip around $40.",

I love this bar. They beer selection is amazing and then food is probably the best bar good I have ever had. And remember the euro bartenders names Igor and Vlad?

One thing I liked about it was the bowl was the bread was fresh and could practically peel off. It wasn't rough. Had some bomb seasoning on the bread as well. Im pretty sure it was Sourdough but too many it might have been slightly buttered as well. My friend ordered the loaded fries. I had a couple bites after they had been sitting and they were still great. Can't recall the price of the bowl. I think it was about $9. Not bad considering Farmer Boys is a lot smaller and probably $6-7 dollars in price. Im definitely going back there next Vegas Trip.",

Although, the bar tender was great and offered us free tastings of a couple of others they had on tap that I've never tried. Overall, the beers were good and it was a cool causal place to hang out.",

    "text": "Came here to watch a basketball game during our trip to Vegas.  We had a couple of appetizers to share: Pretzel & Cheese, Franks in a Blanket, and Cheesy Mac Bites.  They were all pretty good - the Franks in a Blanket weren't your traditional pigs in a blanket.  It seemed like the blanket was more like phyllo dough than the crescent roll most of us are used to.  The pretzels were very good - the cheese dip had the right amount of horseradish, but we liked to dip the pretzels in the dip that came with the Franks.  The beer list is adequate - and they offered beers in 24 oz and liter sizes.  The waiter was attentive and the manager made sure to get our game on a convenient TV.  My only regret is not sticking around for dinner!",

We had to ask THREE different people to get our check, including the manager who seemed to not care, and he still managed to mess up the check. Save your money folks and avoid the headaches. Oh and if you're wondering, no they were not busy. When we asked the manager how long it usually takes to get food out he said \"typically an hour and a half or so\".",

There's also more TVs than you can count, it's a great spot to go to watch a big game.  However, a couple of complaints.  The first time I went this fall, I sat at a table and had awesome service, even though our waitress was really busy.  But the last two times, I sat at the bar, and while it wasn't overly crowded, service was less than desirable.  Both times, I considered walking out before anyone took my order.  The bartenders seem to be occupied talking to each other.  The prices are also a bit high.  Going beyond the nachos or chili, and you're getting into $30+ for a burger, fries and a beer.  There are plenty of better restaurants for that rate (or much lower).  The location is convenient, but not sure I'll be back soon.",

Second night I had the pulled pork. Very good (maybe a bit messy but hey it's bbq). Buddy liked the Reuben so well he had it both nights.  We were initially disappointed to see they didn't have the fried green beans as app but tried the pretzel at the suggestion of waiter.  Wonderfully simple and tasty.  The dips are great-especially the Gouda.  So impressed we got it both nights.  Service is low-key but good.   Both nights a bit slow start but fine once underway.  Atmosphere is sports bar yet not so loud.  Perfect amount of tvs.  Completely recommend this place.",

This place has many TV views from anywhere you sit so that's great.",

When we got up to the front we explained our situation, and although no promises were made, the staff set to work to make sure we would get in and out in time.  The manager found us a table to seat our party of 5, and had menus out promptly. He pointed out the items that they could prepare quickest out of respect to our schedule. By 8:40, we had our drinks and our meal orders were in. By 8:50 we had our food, and by 9:10 our meal was done and bill was paid. Food was excellent as well.  In short: we gave them a difficult task, and they fulfilled it without compromising on quality. Doubt they'd be able to do this for everybody (nature of the restaurant business and all), but they deserve credit for going above and beyond with their service.",

Not too bad, but next time I'll make a reservation. Service was great, friendly service. Comfortable seats, clean bathroom. Food came out quickly. We had the wings, pulled pork, clam chowder and thai salad. All better than average except for the salad. Didn't read the description well, it had lo mein noodles and not enough cabbage. Never had cooked noodles in my thai salad. Fried yes, but not cooked. Not a good combination. But again, very enjoyable meal and thought the staff worked well together. Would definitely come back again. If they had pizza or a flat bread to the menu that would be even better!",

We chose the Tap as we are big college football fans.  We were expecting normal bar food and ok service.  Wow!!!!  We were so surprised.  Our waitress (Choy) was wonderful.  The food was also wonderful.  Even though we live here and never go to the strip we will keep this gem in mind!    We had the shrimp bucket, loaded fries and the chandelier of beer and a few cocktails.  Highly recommend.    Next time my husband wants to try their pork chop dinner and I want the nachos. Several tables near us had those 2 choices and they looked wonderful.",

Since I took down a couple of liter beers, I made sure to take Notes in my iPhone just in case I might not remember how wonderful the meal was the next day. These are the notes I came up with:  1. Ranch dressing YUMMM.  2. Cheese curds were nice and hot and fresh (they were probably the best damn cheese curds I've ever had). 3. Liter beer was icy - some people might have a problem with this. Me, on the other hand, like this because I can sometimes be a slow drinker.  4. Huge burger. HUGE. And a huge thing of fries. Robert couldn't even put the burger down because he was afraid he wouldn't be able to pick it back up. It looked delicious and he said it was.  5. Franks in a blanket - lot of hot dog and light crispy bun. Just right for a girl who needs food in her tummy when drinking.  6. Contemplated getting onion rings or more appetizers but wasn't sure if we could finish them so decided against it. Wise choice. 7. Fried s'mores so amazing crispy outside soft inside of chocolate and marshmallow with a side of chocolate OMG so good!!!!! 8. Awesome menu assortment of all my favorite appetizers I want it alllllll - onion rings, hit dogs, sliders, cheese curds it is so hard to choose.  I kid you not, I'm sitting here salivating thinking about their cheese curds and fried s'mores. Like I said at the beginning, it is a bit pricey but it's worth it. The server was very friendly and helpful and the menus had sports quizzes on them to entertain. We will definitely come back here on our next trip.",

The salad was spicy and True to its name, but not overwhelmingly so. The service was just fine and friendly. Kudos to the staff for allowing us to charge a phone there!",

They def need more servers, though. There was a convention in the hotel and our server had 4 other large tables...and our table of 3. Luckily another server was able to get us refills on drinks. The host stand is kind of strange and pointless. Everyone goes up to give the host their name but she then says \"oh no, please wait along the side of the wall and someone will come get your name and # in your party.\" Eventually she calls your name and you are seated. Then the two hosts just stand there while the servers are in the weeds. Strange. But the food was awesome!",

We got there a little over two hours before our show, and had to wait for only about 25 minutes before we were seated, which was fine. Once we were seated we waited 45 minutes before anybody came to take our drink order, by the time that we received our drinks it had been about an hour since we first sat down. Our food came out relatively quickly and was actually very good. Because of the initial amount of time that we had to wait for our drinks we did not have time to get another drink so as soon as our food was delivered we asked for our check so that we would not miss our show. Having been a server for years I understand being busy and overwhelmed; the part of this situation that was most frustrating was seeing a manager standing at the front of the restaurant just talking and laughing with the hostesses when there were clearly tables that were not receiving ample service. We never received an apology or had any manager check on our experience. It really is a shame that our experience was so negative, we would have loved to go back on our next vegas trip, but because of the circumstances it is safe to say that we won't be returning.",

The ambience was nice. Plenty of large screens to watch multiple sporting events on while you nosh away. Large booths that can easily fit a party of six. Only thing, they don't allow outside drinks even though they're in the middle of the MGM (really?!) Otherwise, overall a great experience. I'll definitely be back during my next Vegas trip.",

Went with chicken tenders and mac n cheese balls, both were really good, and definitely way better than your standard bar fare.  We weren't there during any game but if I was in MGM more often I'd probably make it my go to sports bar during any stay in Vegas.",

    "text": "The first visit would have been a solid 3 stars, but the second visit killed it.  We were staying at the MGM during the Pac-12 Men's Basketball Tournament.  The wait was surprisingly not bad, and the hostess the first time was very friendly and gave us a requested high top so we could have a good view of all the games (with which 2 massive TVs showing about 4 games on average, you can't go wrong).  Our waitress suggested the nachlos--no.  The cheese was hardly melted and the whole thing was just blah.  My husband and I picked at them and that was it.  The loaded fries are better.  Decent price, and we got to spend time watching several games.  The second time we stopped in to watch the ACC championship game before going to the Pac-12 Championship game and managed to snag seats at the bar.  HUGE mistake.  First it took 15 minutes just to get the attention of the bartender, Rico.  Then another 5 minutes for him to finally get our beer order.  Then he disappeared.  People started sitting around us and were getting the same service.  Finally the bar manager was called over by the men next to us who remarked at the bad service.  The bar manager completely blew it off--no bueno.  We finally got our food in, and we got burgers, which were decently good.  But the service was just awful.  It got to the point that the ladies by my husband saw another manager and surrounded him like flies talking about the service.  Magically 4 bartenders appeared right after that--telling me that management wasn't doing a great job managing their staff.  Service can make or break an experience, and the second time it broke it.  Sorry Tap.  There is a pub a couple minutes walk away in MGM that has much better service.",

First off, I ordered the $12 Tennessee Betty cocktail, it was overly sweet and too much of everything except the alcohol.   I ordered the corned beef short ribs and was told that they had changed the meat and instead of being corned beef they were beef short ribs. I was ok with that. When they came out the entire dish was different, all the sides were different not just the meat. It would have been nice to have been told this.  Our waiter also let us sit forever. He walked by to tables next to us multiple times before coming by to check on how things were, if we needed any drinks when our glasses were empty or if we were finished.  I will be sure to not visit this restaurant on my next stay at the MGM Grand.",

And for an extra $3 on top of your $8-$10 beer you can upgrade from a pint to a 24 oz mug.  Or for an extra $6 you can upgrade to a 36 oz.  Just in case you like drinking a massive flagon of craft beer in one sitting.  Decided to try some food.  Got the chicken nachos.  They were alright but nothing special.  I probably wouldn't come here again for food... just for beers and to watch the game on their many sportscasting TV's.  TAP is conveniently located right next to the MGM Sports Book, in case you are inclined to bet on said games (which I am not, but there are many who are).",

The place gets packed on Saturdays and Sundays during the football season so you might have trouble grabbing a table if you're with a big group.  There appeared to be a good amount of seating at the bar if you can get in there early.  Food is basic bar food, I wouldn't get anything other than wings or perhaps a burger, anything else would be a waste in my opinion. They have some decent deals during game day, I went with the shot and beer combos. Nice variety of beer on taps and most of your classic domestics in a bottle.  Nothing overly special but a nice place to chill and enjoy the games on the numerous TVs.",

We feel as if there was some kind of discrimination against us (we are young and perhaps she presumed we wouldn't tip well or similar as has happened before). Weird experience while waiting for our table, as a family was upset that they couldn't bring their cups in and argued with the hostess, and threw a drink on the floor and called her names.

We braved the cold temps and ran across the bridge to the MGM grand and found this place super easily.  We were seated quickly and after a little bit of consideration, we ordered the chili in a cornbread bowl and the captains burger.    Our server was great!  She was friendly and helpful, chatty but not too much and she got our food out to us in a timely manner.  I've never seen a cornbread bowl before, but I'm convinced that that should be the only way chili should be served from now on!  The captains burger was also amazing, cooked perfectly with great flavors coming from the toppings that just made the burger out of this world.    I'm glad we ended up here.  it might have been a little pricey, but man  way it delicious and we were absolutely stuffed when we walked out.  Great choice!",

I had no idea, as it's been 15+ yrs since I've been here! We had dinner here with our kids and while there was no kids' menu, there were plenty of kid-friendly items to pick from. My kids split the cheesesteak with fries/onion rings, and my husband and I split the grilled pesto chicken sandwich and each had a beer. It was plenty of food. The chicken sandwich was great - loved the arugula and bacon and the ciabatta bread bun was delicious! Our kids loved their meal as well. Enjoyed the upscale sports bar atmosphere. Highly recommend this place!",

Our waitress was very nice and friendly, but it took about 15 minutes to get our drink order taken as we just sat at the table wondering who if anyone would be our server. She finally came and took the drink order and then we waited again for a good 15 minutes before she came back to take our food order. She seemed overly accommodating to the large table of guys seated next to us, but we were not so lucky. We ordered an appetizer which came out quickly.  The fried cheese curds were just below average. One of my party ordered a hamburger which was also just average and another ordered the wings which were average at best. I ordered Mac and cheese which literally came out 15 or 20 minutes after my other dining companions got their food. The excuse was their broiler was broken. It came out warm, but not very tasty. Really disappointed. We were all asked if we wanted drinks to go and I said yes. When she brought my drink it was not what I had originally ordered and although she had it in a plastic cup, she explained that she had no lids. I had to take it in a cab open back to my hotel. The overall experience was just bad. Have no plans to return.",

    "text": "Rather then just start killing it I'll start with the good. My wife and I ate there last Thursday when we first arrived in town. Food was good burger was excellent good wings too. Service was fine no issues. Plenty of TV's. Also location is prime across from sports book.  All was good until Sunday. Sunday myself and my friend arrived right before kickoff at 10:00am after placing some bets in the sports book. We sat in two seats at the bar ordered our drinks and were in NFL heaven surrounded by the TV's and our betting tickets. Our wives decided to meet us at TAP for some food and we asked the hostess to put us in for a table as we sat at the bar. This is were the problem started.  We were not allowed to put in for a table because all parties weren't there. I thought that was weird because it was 45 minute wait for a table and our wives were planning on being their well before that. So while not really accommodating I can somewhat understand the rule and I wasn't upset about that at the time. What really upset is what  came next  once our wives arrived. Knowing we now had all parties present I put in for a table again. That's when I was told that the only way we could put in for a table is if someone from our party left the bar area and waited directly in front of the hostess station.   All I wanted to do is watch football at the bar while we waited for a table and they wouldn't do that. By this point I was $100.00 in for my bar tab plus $150.00 I spent two days before for  lunch at this place. Give me a break. We instead walked out and rang up $500.00 Tab at the PUB at the other side of the casino who was more then willing to let us hang at the bar until our table was ready. Maybe it was the hostess screwing up or maybe it's how the place is managed I don't know. All I do know is every other restaurant I've ever been at allows you to put in table and wait at the bar until your table is ready. Seems like restaurant 101 and common sense, but not at this place. Because of this experience I will NEVER go back. Maybe they should get a dictionary and look up what HOSPITALITY means.",

We decided that TAP would be the best place to sit and watch football Sunday morning! We were so wrong. It was the worst experience we had during the whole 4 days! We had Jennifer as our bartender/server we were there pretty early. We sat down and we were given our menus we ordered some water to start with as we looked over the menu. We were then ignored for approximately 15 minutes or so. She finally comes back and says. \"Oh I should've warned you guys, it's going to get so busy here you should've ordered when I first gave you the menus\" we were completely taken back but proceeded to order. A little while later I asked for some more water and she responded with \"I'm doing the best I can\". The couple that was right next to us ordered after we did and they received their food first. The guy on the other side ordered after them and also received his food before we did. The food was mediocre. After we finished our food she came to find out what else we wanted to order. We said we'd take some more water for now. She then explains that if we weren't going to order anything else we would need to leave because the seats we were sitting in we're only for customers who continuously spend movie while sitting there. We had enough. We decided to leave. She said \"since you did order food I'll give you a couple minutes to get everything together\". Then she took a long time and couldn't keep our orders the same since my friend and boyfriend switched seats. It was a huge inconvenience for her. When we were ready to leave she didn't even come give us chance we needed to ask the bar back to do it so we can finally leave. Needless to say we will not be returning. And I don't recommend this place at all.",

It was starting to get packed, so the bartenders were getting busy. I order a draft beer which I didn't know their largest size was in a 32oz mug. WOW, I was amazing on how large the mug was. I was happy. I ordered a burger with onion rings. The burger was good but the onion rings were the greatest onion rings I have EVER eaten. It was golden outside and crispy with a perfect favor. It was the perfect onion rings. Got one more 32oz beer and I was satisfy. If I come back to MGM Grand, I am coming back here again, no doubt!",

The wait was short only about 15 minutes to be seated. It took us 10 minutes to be greeted where we ordered both our food and drinks. From that point it took 15+ minutes to receive our cocktails by which point we had already received our food. One item didn't come out so we asked a manager if he could inquire where our chicken fingers were at which point he says \"I need to tap another table first\" and walks away. As someone in the service industry that was the rudest thing I have ever experienced. He finally comes over and he tells us he is sorry and that the chicken is on the house. We told him one of the cocktails didn't taste right and if he could just remove it from the bill at  which point he rolled his eyes and said yes and walked away.  Fast forward to finishing the meal and going to pay the bill every item on the bill was increased by up to $2 from the price listed on the menu. We asked to speak to a manager again and the first one whose name is Ryan comes back over and trys to say we got their weekday menu and that it was the weekend prices we were being charged. Which seems farfetched considering we were sat with 3 of the same menus, I also grabbbed a menu from the service station which also was the same and the table across from us had 4 of the same menus. It was just a very shady discrepancy to have and I said so. Ryan tells us I'm sorry again and that he will fix the bill. We paid the bill and left no fuss. I am just shocked at the sub par service of this restaurant perpetrated by the managers. It might be a good idea to re-train the staff. Now I know not to frequent this establishment and Ryan if you are reading this I would definitely work on your people skills. You do not treat your customers as you did us and try overcharging us and then fumbling for an excuse once you were caught. Not the best idea for future reference.",

My wife and I were not that hungry but knew we should eat before the show so we ordered Kobe Burger with onion rings split for two and two Porters. Waitress had no problem splitting the order and even provided two additional plates. Meal was still so filling, we did not eat anything for the rest of the night. Food was served hot and obviously fresh.  Flavors were awesome and the burger cooked to a medium rare perfection as requested. Onion rings were super crunchy and full of favor and makes my onion ring top five list that I have ever had. Our waitress Margaret J, was outstanding. She provided warm friendly and professional service. Thank you, Margaret!  I only have one negative and it's not a bid deal, but the onion rings were service with a spicy ketchup and I don't like ketchup, never have, never eat it. I think its tastes is vile. Although I know most the population loves it I don't. So, my negative is that I was charged a $1.25 for a ranch substitute.",

    "text": "So, I've been debating this review for a few weeks now. I made the journey up to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 Championship Tournament (Go Cats!) which was hosted in the MGM Grand Arena. Now, knowing how \"large\" each casino is and the fairly limited sports bar options here, TAP was really the only place to keep watching basketball between sessions, so we actually went here more than once AFTER poor service, but if you can, try and avoid this place.  First visit: If you walk up to this place, you'll notice the \"open air\" concept they have. Unfortunately for them, it allows you to see how many open tables there currently are. If half of the table are open, you'd assume that you can walk right up and get seated. Not the case here. And actually what's worse, is we waited roughly 45 minutes to get a table. Now, when someone confronted the hostess about this situation (given, this man did not take the best approach), he was then surrounded by security within five minutes and followed around by these thugs until he went out of sight from us - hopefully there was no scenes from the movie 21 that occurred. The meal was actually really good (food and waitress were awesome), but when I told the on-duty manager (more calm than the first guy) about the situation and that it's actually troubling to watch another patron complain and get intimidated out of the casino, he could really care less. Typical Vegas.  Night two: Like I said, few options we found to watch basketball and get beers between games - However, we were actually seated in a timely manner. This time, our waiter was actually horrible, not rude, but just lacking any service skills. Our group of roughly 12 people request split checks up front and he responded, \"We don't split checks here.\"  I proceeded to tell him the waitress yesterday actually did for the exact same group - again, more attitude. At this point I gave up, ordered a beer and dinner, only to find he brings me the wrong beer. I ate my open-faced steak sandwich, bolted, watched the Cats win the tournament and am glad I only have to go to Vegas once a year.  Seriously, try and avoid this place if possible - get a tallboy somewhere and stand outside to watch the games.",

    "text": "TAP Sports Bar has to be one of my oddest and amazing stops I've ever had. We made two stops and everything was completely different. On our first stop the service was excellent. We ordered wings with a side of the ghost chili sauce and they were delicious but pretty freakin spicy. We also ordered nachos and they were also good not too cheesy and not too dry. This is where things get complicated....we were waiting for my cousins to get to Vegas via their flights from Seattle and they arrived two hours after our dinner. After they arrived they were hungry and also wanted drinks so we stopped at TAP again. On our second trip that night everything flipped. We had the rudest server I've ever had in my life. She was unhelpful and gave the worst answers when we had a question. When my cousin asked her what she thought of a beer she just said no I don't drink that and just didn't care. She took our drink orders and three members of my party ordered food. Now things got weird five minutes later my cousin wanted something to eat and she just told him no the kitchen is now closed. That's fine although usually they give some sort of warning the kitchen is closing. Now things get even stranger a different waitress comes to our table and she asks us for our drink and food orders all over again. Apparently the first waitress just couldn't be bothered with our order anymore. I thought wow she must have quit or something but nope she was still helping other tables or maybe helping or just being useless. I wrecked my brain trying to figure out what her problem was because we weren't rude and the bar wasn't closing for another 3 hours. I guess she was just in a horrible mood or maybe she's just a horrible person but who knows. Our second waitress was actually the waitress who helped us on or first trip so service was much better. I'd love to give this restaurant a good review but because of this waitress I feel our trip started off ok the wrong foot.",

    "text": "Skimmed through the reviews and shocked that some Yelpers could praise Taps yet only give it 4 stars! What I experienced was a solid 5-star experience.  Yes, prices can be high but it's Vegas! We actually were there on the first of the NCAA play-off weekends, some places were charging up to $400 minimum food/beverage per person tab to sit and watch for the day. Taps was only $75 for the day which our party of 4 quickly met, plus Taps wasn't doing a \"per person\" minimum but a party minimum which was huge as I cannot hardly eat / drink as much as my male counterparts.  Between the four of us we sampled the wings, a burger with fries/onions rings, Taps signature pretzel, Caesar salad, chicken sandwich and chicken strips with a side of veges. All served up hot and delicious. Really cannot complain about the food.   I'm a little less judgmental of food as, for me, ambiance and service can make or break an establishment. Taps is a solid 5 on both. Huge screens to watch a plethora of games / events from any angle. As we sat there ALL DAY we went through 3 servers. A bit of a delay in service between server #1 and server #2 but Jeff, the manager, quickly stepped in and made it right by personally taking our orders then continually \"checking in\". Really fun guy to talk to, at one point our conversation turned to the various mimosa concoctions and Jeff not only described a \"breakfast\" mimosa he treated our entire party to one.   Needless to say, I found our day (literally) at Taps extremely enjoyable and would definitely recommend it as the place to be during Final Four Festivities or anytime in between.",

Sadly we couldn't drink alcohol as we were only on break, but we will be back to try some of the libations!  I got the three alarm burger with onion rings. I can honestly say this was one if the best burgers I've had. (That's saying alot seen as we work at another section of MGM and our kitchen makes an amazing burger.) It wasn't so much the ingredients on the burger, although it was all yummy, as the actual meat that was seasoned so well and you tasted it in every  bite. Don't let the name fool you, it's not overly spicy, just had a nice kick to it and the onion rings were crunchy perfection. My friend got  the tuna poke nachos which was also delicious. Nice chunks of raw tuna heaped on crispy wontons seasoned with sesame and cilantro. This was my first time at Tap, but it  certainly won't be the last.",

I could have put a straw in it and drank it! (It was DE-LISH!) The food and beer took quite some time to get to our table...wait staff was slow but definately friendly ....Just don't expect the wait staff to actually \"Wait\" on you.....anyways what do you expect for a Friday night?

    "text": "TAP Sports Bar just opened about a month ago.  They are located in the MGM towards the back of the casino parallel to the Sports book.  A very nice open space with lots of TV's to watch all the games in action.  Definitely a good spot to go especially if all the chairs in the sports book is full.  They have a good menu with plenty of yummy eats and drinks.  It was kinda late when we arrived and had about 5min to get our order in because the kitchen closes at 11pm.    Fries and Gravy ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-las-vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-...</a>  This bowl was huge.  It has fries and fried cheese curds, those are the brown pudgy looking ones.  The gravy had a decent taste.  Could have used a bit more of it though.  Braised Bacon Corn Dogs ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-las-vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#WaZNbNTffH30OujvBDx6IQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-...</a> This one confused me a bit and was not sure what to expect.  Instead of a hot dog I felt like I was eating a stick of corned beef wrapped with bacon.  Whatever though it was pretty damn good so I was totally ok with it.  It had a really tasty mustard sauce that came with it that I really enjoyed.  Buffalo Wings ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-las-vegas?select=JEK35FcNFybUssaqMusqMw#xhsxeyv7jom3w1qGmfRqfw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tap-...</a>  These were finger licking good!  You can actually choose from 4 different sauces and the waiter recommended to stick with the Buffalo and we were glad we did.  I could have had another basket of these wings!    This was probably not the healthiest thing to eat at midnight but hey were in VEGAS!!!  Eyes ~ Wow I get to eat all this so late at night! Nose ~ Smells Yum!. Ear ~ Still a few peeps hanging around. Mouth ~ These are all pretty good!. Tummy ~ I'm going to make you pay in the morning for stuffing me up at midnight!",

Probably 30 minutes after it started and because someone like myself politely asked. Then have your hard headed manager come up to me regarding not switching the channel till it starts. Or should I say 10 minutes after a game starts. I'm not the only one who has complained about this \"sports bar\" not turning on a game until way after it started. How about this. When a big event is planned such as the Super Bowl, Selection Sunday, Kentucky Derby, maybe turn it on before it starts as to not make your customers nervous they will miss the start.

The first time I went in, I sat at the bar, right in the middle, for 10 minutes without being even greeted, and left. They were nowhere near busy, so I can't even give them excuse as to why I wasn't seen. The second time I went in, only because I was staying at the MGM, was much better. I was greeted by the Bartender immediately, and that was much more refreshing. They have a good selection of beers, and being from Chicago now, it was nice to see a good amount of Goose Island products on draft, including Matilda and Sophie. But anyways, there food was pretty good. I had the chili and the philly sliders, and I was definitely full when I left, and the check didn't break the bank too much for Strip food. The service was pretty decent, absolutely much better than being ignored. But overall, my heart was still hurt from being ignored on the first visit. Maybe I smelled really bad...",

    "text": "I'm staying at the MGM Grand and I was looking for some place to grab a quick bite. I stopped in and they had a special for salmon with finger potatoes and sweet corn for 25 bucks. That sounded pretty tasty and so I decided to give that a go. I'm really glad that I did. I enjoy nice fresh salmon and I'm going to be honest with you. This is the absolute best salmon that I've ever tasted. I've never had salmon this juicy and this tender. I've heard people say that they've had a meat dish that melted in their mouth and most of the time that has been hyperbolic in my experience but this is one of the rare occasions that I feel like that's an accurate statement. The food that I tried was delicious and melt in your mouth good. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly and accommodating. They are called the Tap for a reason and if you enjoy a cold beer they have about fourty different beers on tap and a big selection of wines in various sizes. I'm a big baseball fan and I was really enjoying watching all the action from the diamond on eight different sixty inch screens and about 30 other flat-screens. I was able to watch five games at once while I ate and this seems like the place to come in the MGM to watch games. Good food, fun atmosphere and tons of sports and tons of beer choices. I really enjoyed this place and would give it a really high recombination, particularly if you are staying in the MGM Grand. You can charge your meal and your drinks to your room and relax and watch all of the games. If you are in the MGM you can't miss it. It's where the old lion habitat used to be right across from the Rainforest Cafe and the escalators to the Tropicana and to the New York, New York.",

The food was average at best. I had the Reuben Sandwich and the wife had a Pulled Pork Sandwich. The Reuben didn't have that traditional Reuben taste which was kind of a let down. The reason I am only giving this 3 stars was because of the waitress. \"LJ\" I believe was her name. It took 15 minutes to get drinks and appetizer ordered. (Cheese Curds were good.) Drinks and appetizer were brought to us quickly by someone else. We didn't see LJ for another 20 minutes or so. We put in our order and once again someone else brought us our food. We were constantly waiting for refills. After we finished our food we finally got LJ back to our table. I had my credit card ready to ensure less of a wait to get out of there. I have patience with a waiter/waitress but this waitress didn't have any sense of urgency. Obviously they were  busy if they had a wait but she was very lackadaisical and slow footed. I would recommend the place but I would try to steer away from this waitress.",

Our first welcoming was plenty of open-seating and lots of large televisions with varieties of games on to entertain. Yay! Second was the warm hospitality from our server, Choy- she did an awesome job recommending dishes and giving us all details on drink specials (and then later keeping speedy service to get us on our way to the next event.) They had some decent drink specials and their barfoods-centric menu has everything from sliders and wings to ribeyes, ribs and fish/chips.  We went for the Mini Philly sliders- they were awesome! Chopped steak, roasted onions & red bell peppers, all mixed in melty-cheese and then piled into buttery Parker rolls. I'm not kidding, we were a happy bunch! Add fries for a couple bucks and this dish is plenty for 2 to share (the fries were also delish.)  The Cheerleader (Absolute, maraschino, pineapple and a large orange wedge) was overly sweet, so we ordered the shot-&-a-beer special ($12) --a good deal, as a plain shot is $11-- and mixed the shot to the drink, which balanced out the sweetness. As she brought our check, Choy read our minds and dropped off plastic cups for our drinks to take back on down the way to the MGM G.G. Can't beat that kind of service!!",

The friendly hostess sat us immediately, offering a choice between the large bar or a table- we chose the latter and were seated in a half-empty section with a great view of the many TVs and the Poker Room. In spite of the lack of busyness, it still took the server over 10 minutes to get to us. She was friendly and efficient once she got to us, but again took awhile to realize when we were finished. Drinks are comparable in size and price to most Strip bars- $8 draft beer, (upgrade to the larger 24oz size for just $3),$14 cocktails- plenty of good top shelf choices, and they advertise a \"reverse happy hour\" at 10pm. The Clam Chowder is delicious- be sure to get the sourdough bread bowl for just a few dollars more. But while a $20 burger isn't an anomaly on the Strip, for the price one expects a really top-notch eating experience. The temperature was perfect but the patty lacked seasoning and the bread was about as impressive as wonder bread. I enjoyed the vibe, the drinks, and the soup, but because service was slow and because of the generally boring yet expensive burger, this place loses 2 stars.",

More patrons were going to the nearby club: I know it's Vegas. I bring this up because out of all the empty tables, the young lady wanted to seat us close to the door at the most awkward table. Needless to say we asked for a table close to the action and that we can people watch outside of the restaurant.  Since we were all traveling most of the day and hungry, we wanted quick but good food and lots of drinks. Drinks were a bit pricy without a kick. I mean, no hint of liquor or alcohol at all. Those went back and the second batch tasted better although not the best. Now for food: the pretzel with dipping sauces was good, the burgers not so good. Fries tasted like they were dipped in hot oil to make them appear fresh; they were crispy and chewy. Everyone's meals had a problem.  On top of food and drinks not being good, there was a BITTER AFTERTASTE to EVERYTHING! It was as if the food was sprayed with something to keep it fresh looking and it didn't burn off during cooking.  The manager waived off most of everything. We walked away disappointed, hungry, and an awful hand sanitizer taste on our tongues.  Sorry, but food shouldn't taste like hand sanitizer!!",

    "text": "TAP is a typical Vegas sports bar, with premium prices, average beer selection and a wall of televisions blaring in the background. Casinos rely solely on gambling to turn a profit, so it's rare to find a comfortable, hospitable bar on the Strip. TAP is no exception, so expect a hard stool with  a $12 Dos Equis, served up by a rotating cast of part-time bartenders.   Above all else, don't expect to connect with anyone over a cocktail. The basic purpose of these bars is to ice out the drunks and refuel bachelor parties, so meaningful conversation is unlikely. If you can hear your voice over Journey, Bon Jovi or Nelly, it's unlikely anyone else can. So why even try?  Alcohol is ubiquitous in Nevada and cheaply available off the Strip. What's more, public consumption is tolerated in tourist areas within reasonable norms. Rather than waste money in a casino bar that passively resents you, be kind to yourself. Head to Lee's Discount Liquor and sip discreetly from your CamelBak like a winner.",

Too bad we weren't able to experience it.   This was the shortest wait restaurant we found on a busy Saturday night at 11PM so we decided to ask for a table for 2 and accepted the 15 minute wait.  We placed a name and initially experienced brief irritably from the hostest but didn't pay any mind to it because there were several people in line and everyone has their moments.   We took a few steps back and waited 20..25 minutes right in front of the host desk then I asked my date why it was taking so long and he proceed to ask the hostest when our table would be ready. She was currently in the middle of a heated argument with other customers who she had supposedly called their name already but they didn't answer. She rudely told my date the same thing, that she had already called our name and gave away our table to someone else.    The thing I didn't understand about this situation was that she was looking at us the entire time we were waiting and if she called us, and seen us there, I get that it's a busy night but if you can't remember the order of your waiting for customers, there is a problem. Secondly, she should never have been unfriendly or rude with any of us customers even if she was right and she did call our names and we just stupidly ignored her.  Something differently should be done to improve the efficiency of the waiting process at this restaurant",

Then once we got seated one of my family members who had a new born baby, was wearing a crop top with workout shorts. (It was a hot day! The hottest out of this whole weekend) When our server came to the table, she got our drinks then said that my family members needed to wear a shirt. And asked if we had one for her to wear. We did not. So we asked if she could ask the manager if it was ok for us to still dine here. She came back with our drinks and said the manager was ok with it. So we ended up ordering our food. We were in our booth for about 35 mins. As soon as our food was about to be put on the table the assistant manager told my family member that if she could cover up or we had to leave. * NOTE SHE APPROACHED HER VERY RUDELY, HAD NO CONSIDERATION OF WHAT POLITE OR WHAT MANNERS WERE* The assistant manager tried to say that she was the manager. (She was not dressed professionally, her hair was a mess and her outfit didn't even look appropriate) We ended up seeing the waitress go to the manager and complain. So my family member approached the manager and still got treated with disrespect. This place needs to re train their managers and assistant manager or at least get new ones. This was ridiculous! I bet if my family member tried to breast feed we would have got kicked out as well. We ended up eating else were. BE WARNED! A lot of reviews about this place is correct! Rude service! Approach with caution and be careful with what you wear here.",

    "text": "This place really, really screwed up on their service from the start. First, I was waiting on line and when we got to the front, the hostess came and got the people right behind us to take a seat. Seriously!? So when I asked about it the hostess actually accused us of cutting in line! I was so furious that I called the manager. When we originally got in line we make sure to see who was behind us, just to avoid this situation! When the manager came over he apologized and promised to seat us right away. However after they did it, it took over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. I watched table after table get service before they would even come in our direction. This is no doubt because the manager told the servers to not come to our table out of spite for complaining in the first place.   A South African manager then came over to apologize. He was polite and said that wasn't the case, but I feel like the first manager did that on purpose. If a table is already upset, wouldn't you go above and beyond to make them happy?   Bottom line, this restaurant had horrible service in that regard. If you eat here expect to be treated like trash and if you complain MGM will treat you even worse. So if you want to be treated like garbage go ahead and go here.   The ONE redeeming quality is Nikki from LA. She's a great server and tried really hard. She cares and is the reason they get two stars (otherwise one would've been too many). She apologized for their managers (shouldn't it be the other way around??) and went out of her way to try to make up for it. So she deserves the credit. I hope she gets a promotion because she should be running the place.   Overall I can't recommend it. I wish I could due to the location by the sports book. I would look for something else if you want to be treated at all well.",

    "text": "I have only written one review in yelp before, a positive experience. I'm one of these people who use the app but don't comment often, but felt this time was warranted. I consider myself easy to please but the customer service at Tap Sports Bar is absolutely horrendous. They asked me not to bring in my outside beverage, which was a brand new drink I just got outside the door to the restaurant. After I obliged and threw away my new drink, we sat at the bar and asked if they would be showing a specific game, to which they stated they would switch it to the TV in front of us. We ordered beers and an appetizer, then the waiter asked us how we would like to pay cash or card, before we have had a single bite. After about 10 minutes of watching the game on my phone he informed me they do not get that channel for the game. Why didn't you tell me that ahead of time?? We paid our tab without eating or finishing our beers, as they did not seem to care. Staff was not rude, but just did not seem to care about anything and was not personable at all. Luckily, as I walked out of the restaurant, the sports book had it on 4 of their 28 TVs, including one of the two giant screens, as it is a national broadcast.... Maybe they just had a bad day, but I would not recommend anyone come here to watch a game. Hope you all have better luck than we did.",

    "text": "A nice sports bar just off the main casino floor of the MGM Grand, across from the Centrifuge Bar.  It's open late...until 1:00 AM...so great for some late-night grub.  There's a pretty good selection of upscale bar foods that includes a variety of salads, burgers and the like.  Portions are a pretty good size, so keep that in mind.  You may even want to split your plate with a friend.  There are numerous televisions around the restaurant and bar playing the latest sporting events.  Decor is upscale rustic with sports memorabilia all around you.  Staff is pleasant and helpful in making recommendations.    If you're in or near the MGM, give this place a shot.  I don't think I would go out of my way to return, but that's primarily because there is so much more Las Vegas has to offer, so I'd rather keep trying more places.",

My husband got a table first and asked the server if they could put the sound on so we could hear commentary, etc. The manager claimed that there were people who did not want to hear the Home Run Derby at a sports bar (???) and that would not be happening. Another manager said there was a lot going on sports wise--cycling and minor league basketball??? Even when at least 75% of the patrons were watching and cheering during the Derby, management refused to budge. We gave 4 stars cause the appetizer we had (shrimp) was delicious and our server (Choy) was amazing!!! Don't recommend if you really want to get into your game or sporting event.",

    "text": "I loved this joint. It's a super nice, upscale sports bar with loads of TVs. They've also just expanded their beer on tap menu significantly. We went early (watching a big 10 game) so there was no wait to get seated at all. For food, two words: fried cheese. Fried Wisconsin cheese curds coated in some divine garlicky goodness. Don't think. Just do it. Very very generous portions. The best thing about this place was the service. I live in LA, so I'm starved for unpretentious, good service. This place offers that. Everyone from the hostess to the bartender was super solicitous and friendly. They went out of their way to find us seats with a good view of our game, which was not one of the bigger games being broadcast that day. The bartender gave good recommendations (did I mention \"fried cheese\"?) and allowed us to taste a number of different beers before ordering. We asked for our wings extra crispy and we got them exactly as requested. This place is not cheap but it's fair. I would totally go back.",

    "text": "Terrible service. My husband and I came here about a month ago before seeing a show (we are locals). We had no consistent waiter/waitress. It was obviously shift change and no one could figure out who was waiting on our table. The apps took forever and we saw half of the order sitting under the heat lamps for ten minutes before it got brought to us. Just a bad experience over all. This past Saturday night we decided to give it another try. We thought we'd sit at the bar this time because we should definitely get better service there. Unfortunately, we picked the wrong side of the bar. The bartender completely ignored us for a good five minutes (no eye contact or anything) and one of the other bartenders from the other side asked if we had been helped yet and ended up getting us our beers. Then we were stuck with our guy again who took forever to take our order and was just non attentive. He was pretty enthralled in a conversation with a couple from Australia. I think he was crushing on the woman because she really tied up all of his attention while they were there. It's too bad because we will not be going back there ever again because of the lack of service that we received on both occasions.",

For the price I don't think it was worth it. $23 dollars for a burger for me should be crazy good. I probably could go to in n out and have a double double and be better satisfied. I guess it's the price for eating on the strip. They had a pretty wide range of beers on tap. Had a 32oz blue moon with an orange that hit the spot. The service was good and the wait was like 5 minutes. I'd probably recommend this place if you are looking to get an appetizer with a drink. Dinner wise I'm sure you can find a better deal on food somewhere else.",

    "text": "Among all the sports bars in Vegas, TAP probably rates somewhere in the middle. It has a nice busy atmosphere, in that there are a ton of TVs, a ton of fried food options and a ton of beer. Your experience however highly depends on your waitress and the manager who's on duty.  We decided to spend a solid 5 hours at TAP for March Madness, totaling at least $275 in total tab. While our first waitress was excellent, our second waitress wasn't as accommodating. The manager on duty seemed clueless about where to put the March Madness games on - why would a division II basketball game take up a prime TV spot? Makes no sense. Then I have a small complaint about not opting for a high-end projector, rather a TV wall that takes away some of the clarity.  If you happen to be in the area and you need a sports bar, TAP is good. But don't go out of your way because it's nothing more than a re-branded bdubs.",

Very stiff and cranky. We ordered food and appetizers. The appetizers came out 5 minutes before the food and one even came after the food, after we had to ask where it was. Only one order was wrong and that's what put this visit over the edge. Margaret was so rude about her error, she read back the order and the asked \"well what's missing\". Everything was wrong. It was basically a burger between two slices of bread. At that point we asked for the manager on duty. Jeff came over and talked with us. He said he would \"make things right\", we enjoyed our meal, as the food was fantastic. The bills came and nothing was taken off, so Jeff, what did you do for us?",

We got seated at a nice booth and ordered the giant pretzel app and I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with a mix of onion rings and fries, plus a couple beers. All the food was really wonderful. The portions were gigantic.    It was pricey, but hey that is Vegas, we really liked it!",

They made sure our glasses of water never ran out and came by frequently to check up on us.  We were hungry and ordered the pretzel appetizer. Be warned, it's ginormous. The dips they give with it (a couple kinds of cheese and some mustard) are really good and I honestly could have just ordered another pretzel and been full.  I ordered a burger and fries and they cooked it just like I asked and it was delicious. I'm not gonna lie - neither of us were able to finish our meal. Everything was pricey, but they compensated with huge portion sizes.",

Still pricey for sports bar food (of course - it's in a casino) but nothing compared to most of the other sit down restaurants that you'll find in MGM. I ordered a greek salad and expectations weren't high. Salad at a sports bar? Nahh. But in all honesty I was surprised at how good this salad was. It had a ton of fresh veggies and toppings - goat cheese, pita strips, kalmata olives, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, cukes, pickled onions and even grape leaves. The portion was also huge and difficult to finish. I washed everything down with a mojito that did not disappoint.  We told our waitress that we were in a rush because we had concert tickets and she made sure that our food and check came out fast. Much appreciated.  Highly reccomend if you are in the MGM casino and find yourself looking for some classic and easy to please eats!",

    "text": "There was a group of eight of us that met here to have lunch on our last day of Las Vegas. Since we were all splitting up after a lunch and going our separate ways when the waitress got to our table (before we ordered) we asked her if we can all have separate bills. She said that we could have separate bills but that it would be take her about 10 additional minutes to adjust our bills. Although that was a weird thing to tell us, we all agreed that we are okay with her taking 10 minutes and requested that she split up our bills again. She had a couple other short comments at the table and we assumed she was just having a bad day.   Onward to ordering of the food which was actually quite tasty. Now on to the bill. When the bill comes we can see that she did not separate the bill like we asked her to... what she did instead was put all of our orders separate on the receipt and circle our individual totals. That did not work well for us since we were all paying separately.   My total was $23 and some change and I had a $50 bill and the exact change. I told the waitress this and she asked how much change should I get back she brought out her phone but before she could do the math my friend told her $28. So then she takes my 50 and says she's going to go and get change. She comes back and she gives me money and I just put the money in my wallet. In hindsight I should have counted the money before I put it in my wallet but I did not. Everyone else figures out how to pay their bill and we let her know that this was not what we had requested once again. A few minutes go by and the waitress comes back with the bill and says that we have not paid the entire amount. She looks at me and says that I did not pay for my bill. I am confused because I had given her a $50 bill and I explained how we had already spoken about how much my change was going to be. The waitress says that she broke my $50 bill and gave me $50 back so that I could pay. I look at her in confusion and ask to speak to the manager because this is all ridiculous. If we would have gotten our bill separated like we asked we would not have any issues of who had paid what.   The manager comes out and I began telling him my story of what happened and explaining how frustrating of an experience that this was with the waitress. Then the waitress comes back to my table and begins to argue with me in front of her manager. At this point I am completely stunned that she's allowed to come back to the table and the manager is just standing there looking between her and myself. The manager says that the waitress was unable to split our bill because our party was larger than 10 people. We explained to the manager that our party was actually eight people and not 10. The manager says oh. Then the waitress walks away. I explained to the manager that this was a very frustrating experience and that I don't know if I am about to pay my bill two times in a row. The manager says that he is sorry for any inconvenience that I have felt and he literally turns his back to our party and walks away.   This was a terrible experience and  I am surprised that your waitresses are allowed to come back to tables to argue with guests. if in fact she would have taken the time to split up our bills like we first requested...this wouldn't have happened. They were not packed. There were empty tables when we arrived.  I did pay the bill I do not know if the bill was paid twice or not that was never figured out.",

For the price it was plenty of food and was filling for the 2 of us. For anything more than 2 people, might be mofmre of a True appetizer vs a meal. The wings and onion rings were my favorites and they had a great ranch dressing.",

My friends and I had food credit for participating restaurants so to do my due diligence as a True Yelper, I had yelp'd each one and found that this and another restaurant were highest rated out of the other participating restaurants.  Food: I ended up getting a BYO burger with pastrami, chicken breast, and fries/onion rings. Everyone else got something different and we wanted to try different things so we all shared. The food was incredibly delicious and for 8 of us, we had spent about $130 worth of credit. The food was a little expensive but the worth every cent nonetheless.  Service: Service was even better. Our server/waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. Despite being pregnant, she powered through all of our demands and orders and didn't even break a sweat. I give huge props to her because she definitely impressed us with her service.  Overall, we enjoyed our food quite a bit and the service topped it all off. The reason why I didn't put 5 stars because I felt like the food wasn't really worth the price. $19 for a BYO burger is a bit too much.",

They have a big LED screen and TVs all around, so I enjoyed baseball while the hubster watched soccer. Ambiance and decor was nice.   Hubster ordered the wings which were crispy just how we like them. The waitress recommended the sauce on the side to keep the crispiness and she was right. The Buffalo sauce had the perfect kick and they give you a perfect portion of ranch.   Hubster also ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl which tasted bland. Something was missing, flavor.   I had a turkey burger with bacon and fries. Fries were delicious. Perfectly seasoned. The burger...for $22.50 was disappointing. Carl's Jr. turkey burger is waaaay cheaper and has waaaay more flavor.   Oh and I ordered a lemonade that was so bland I thought I was drinking plain water with a slice of lemon squeezed in it.   They did have great customer service. All of the staff was attentive from the hostess at the entrance to the guy picking up our dirty dishes.   Food gets one star, but the customer service is what allowed me to give this place 3 stars. Few other things in the menu I would try, so when I come back for more good wings, I may update my review.",

Let me tell you, everything we ordered turned out way better than we thought. Maybe we were just super hungry and had low expectations...but I can say this- they have gluten-free burger buns!  So, we split a wedge salad and burger. The salad was HUGE and delicious. Just writing about it is making my mouth water. Wonderful crunchy bits of bacon- big chunks- and little cherry tomato halves that popped in your mouth. Blue cheese dressing goes without a say. So good! The burger came out cooked exactly as requested with a big portion of thick cut fries. Not a fan when shredded lettuce is used on burgers, but the fact that the bun was gluten-free made me so happy I'll forget about it.  Four stars because the service was slow and it is a sports bar, so customers can be on the rowdy side.",

Service was good as we were sitting at the bar and it wasn't very crowded.  they also have large beers for a reasonable price (while reasonable for Vegas).  My only complaint was the bathrooms were closed, so it was annoying to have to get out into the casino, especially when drinking beer.  However, overall its a nice escape  from the fancy Las Vegas.",

It's crap, management just doesn't want to do something that is requested because they don't have to. What a crock. Avoid this place and it's crappy management.",

Our server was blah and had no personality, she took forever to come greet us, forever to get our drinks and forever to take our order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (her recommendation) and it was not really pulled pork at all, it was like hunks of meat together and kept falling out of the sandwich.  Very annoying. And then it was supposed to be covered in BBQ sauce which it wasn't but it was dripping something, grease maybe? Instead of nice sauce.   The friends I was with also were not very impressed  with their food, they said the portions were big  but not really tasty at all. One of them had the burger, another the Turkey sandwich and the last one the hummus. I will say looks are deceiving here because at least their food looked good,  But again no one really felt it tasted good. Prices are regular high casino prices  as well, for that money we could go somewhere really nice and delicious. That was not here. I wont be back for more disappointing food. I'll skip mgm/the strip  next time and go to my usual spots.",

So my fiancee and I decided to have dinner here so we could watch the basketball and hockey games. There was a small line waiting when we arrived, so my fiance went up to the hostess to inquire how long the wait would be. Before even answering his question she snapped at him \" you'll have to finish that beer before you come in\" to which he replied \"OK so how long is the wait?\" She replies to him annoyed \" about 10 minutes, but you'll have to finish that beer.\" The beer wasn't even half full so he replied\" no problem\"    We sat on a little bench and within the 10 minutes we were sat (yes he finished his beer)    Their prices seemed somewhat high for burgers and sandwiches but since the place was packed we figured the food was good, we were wrong. His sliders were half raw in the center, The breading on the onion rings made them impossible to eat. My pulled pork sandwich that was served on a pretzel bun, had so much barbecue sauce on the bottom bun that I couldn't pick it up to eat it so I had to cut it in quarters and use a knife and fork.    The only saving grace, was the 805 blonde ale that my fiance loves. But seriously our bill was almost $82 and we ended up taking the food with us and throwing it in a trashcan.    As a bartender/server I know this wasn't the server's fault and we still tipped her 20%.   Never saw a manager, and I wasn't going to ask the hostess since she seem to have the same attitude as we were leaving as she did when she was greeting us!",

Food here is decent for bar food, we found sharing apps every so often beat big eating and let us try lots of snacks. They have a great beer selection, but drinks and food here are VERY pricey.  You can upgrade any beer to a liter which is a \"good deal\" relative to their own prices, but will still run you $15+ each. While we were here our table service was very good.  Never out of beer, many orders of apps, and some fun.  We did notice it was inconsistent between servers, so I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not. I like the place and would return, the only hesitation is the cost.",

If you're staying at the MGM like I did, that's an even better reason to catch the game here; come downstairs and catch the game with some pretty decent food.  I ordered the special, which was a steak, fries, corn, all of which came with a pint of beer of my choice for $34. Pretty good considering the fact that beers are about $8 to $10 each. The food was awesome (and huge portions). I couldn't even finish mine!  To-go boxes all day for me.  Awesome atmosphere,  especially when a big game is on. My suggestion? Go bet on a game, then come to TAPS to root your team on. You may find a new friend (or enemy).",

You can have your beer in a 16 oz (pint), 24 oz, or 33 oz (liter) glass; exceptions are the Chimays and lambics which are served in a 10 oz glass (goblet). I should mention that our expectations of their beer variety was low, and we were pleasantly surprised to find beers we never tried before (i.e. Ballast Point's 3 sheets barley wine, and Goose Island's 312 wheat ale).   The food at this bar is not mind-blowingly unique, but the food is delicious and hearty. Check out my pics of the food and beer lunch menu to see what they were serving as of 9/2/14.   Luis R. served us at the bar: awesome, friendly, professional service!",

He threw down our plates for the appetizers and never checked on us. At one point our waiter, Eric, was even arguing with the manager in plain sight. How unprofessional! This man never smiled the whole time we were there. He also was being rude to the other customers. At the end, he added gratuity that he didn't deserve. When we told him we weren't paying that and explaining why, he started arguing with us with an even bigger attitude. Yeah, horrible service.

This past August we went twice in our 4 day trip. Wings were incredible.   Also, this time we met our extraordinary waitress, I forget her name. An Asian lady that was raised in a Mexican household. She was the BEST server!!! She made this years experience such a pleasure. I'll come back and put her name later.",

There are several beers on tap and tons of screens on the back wall and throughout the bar and dining area for watching sports.  We stopped here for lunch as we wanted to watch a game they were showing, AND directly outside this open-front restaurant in the center of the MGM Grand just off the casino floor, they were introducing and doing interviews with several fighters who'd be featured in UFC matches being broadcast live from the MGM Grand later that week.  The two of us shared a Philly cheese steak sandwich and fries and each had a bloody mary.  Total before tip came to just under $49.",

It unfortunately is one of the few options in MGM Grand, as Centrifuge is even worse.   If you want a decent drink come at happy hour. It's half off beer and some appetizers. That is, if they've decided they aren't having a happy hour. Friday is a weekday and they choose not to have a happy hour. What the fuck is that? I had never stopped in before since it always seems to be closed. They were open this time. I decided to get a drink. The Watermelon Citrus Smash tastes good but it wasn't strong. It's $12 for all cocktails. That's too much for basic light stuff.   I would have ate if food wasn't all $15 or more. It was even the appetizers. They have a few vegetarian options but even those are priced ridiculously.",

They were out of a drink we wanted to order but the waiter recommended one that wasn't on the menu and it was perfect. I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak....and let's say wow. I've eaten a lot of Phillys but normally they're either over cooked and dry and the only saving them is the cheese, but this one was awesome! Meat was juicy, peppers were cooked perfect and the bun was fresh! I got the combo side of fries and onions rings. Onion rings were flavored nicely, and crunchy.  Wife got the BBQ pork sliders. Meat was moist and seasoned nicely. Coleslaw on top wasn't dry and the amount of mayonnaise was just right. Overall it was delicious. Would definitely go again.",

I mean, at least they were good but definitely not worth the price. Their appetizers were more expensive than most meals somewhere else. The whole menu is just pricey lol  It's a cool place to check out because it is a spacious bar and tons of TV. Beers and wings will always be my fave.",

TAP Sports Bar is located on the ground floor of the MGM Grand. It can definitely get packed because it's a sports bar. First time we came, we decided to seat ourself at the bar since there was a small wait. The second time we came back, we were able to dine in at the restaurant side. Both times, we received super good service.  Only thing I didn't really like was that the sodas were SUPER expensive. Good thing we took full advantage of the free refills. First time coming here my friend got their sliders, it was pretty good. Our food runner was nice enough to bring us a side of mayo so we mixed it with ketchup and made an aioli for our fries/onion rings. For me, I got their Philly Cheesesteak. I believe they used to do mini phillys but they stopped. My sandwich was SUPER yummy. I barely finished my fries, it was a lot to enjoy.  Second time we came back, I splurged and went a little overboard on ordering. I started with their steak chili, super big portions. Doesn't come with rice so I ordered their Cilantro Rice. It tasted good but it was too dry to enjoy. Maybe next time I'm better off ordering regular rice. My fiance had their Proper Reuben a lot. They loaded it. We enjoyed as well. My friend got their TAP appetizer platter, it's pretty big. Comes with wings, spinach artichoke dip, chips, fried cheesy Mac bites and onion rings. We were so full and so satisfied we could barely walk the strip after.",

    "text": "While staying at the MGM, our group wanted to grab some lunch.  TAP is located on the west side of the hotel that is near the strip entrance.  With the amount of guests staying here daily, they have a large dining area able to accommodate many.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful during our visit.  During that time, it wasn't very busy. It still took a great while for food to be prepared.    Nevertheless our feast of food was placed before us.  The nachos are a huge plate that can easily be shared among 4.  Toppings were plentiful since we added chicken.  The chicken accompanied jalapenos, pico, guac, sour cream, onion and queso.  Even though it was a very large plate, it wasn't the best tasting nachos and would probably skip those in the future.    On the other hand, our Little Philly Sliders were fantastic.  They packed those babies with a lot of meat and cheese.   They definitely had a lot of flavor.  I would recommend ordering the philly sliders.  Overall I wouldn't be opposed to dining here while in the vicinity.  They have a wide variety on the menu which means much more to try!  PS~ they stopped stocking straws for drinks.",

    "text": "I recently visited Vegas, for the MayPac fight . My husband I went to Tap our second day there. They had a wait, which was understandable due to the large amount of people in the MGM. The wait was only about 15 minutes or so, oppose to the 30min the hostess had stated. Upon being seated, we weren't very satisfied with the table, it was right by the window where people were waiting to be seated. We asked to be moved. The hostess was very nice, and moved us immediately. Once moved, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she returned, we ordered our food. We didn't order anything major, Tap Nachos w/chicken, and beef sliders. The waitress left, she was gone for about 20 minutes, we started to notice people that were seated after us were already enjoying their meals. I was starting to get a little annoyed....... Then another waitress showed up and introduced herself! We were confused, and asked \"where was the other waitress?\" She informed us, that she was off, and going home! I then asked about our order, she informed us that it had been put in by the previous waitress. Ok........ We were now hitting the 45 minute mark, and guess who comes back to our table? The very first waitress that was supposed be gone for the day! Wow! I immediately told her that we had been informed that she was gone for the day, she snapped back responding that she hadn't left yet because she was waiting on our food! Really..... Lol, she walks away, we get up and leave. Wasted a whole hour of my Vegas trip!       So believe it or not, 2 days later, we gave TAP another try. This time was much better. Very nice waitress, we actually received food and service. We pretty much ordered the same thing, but I ordered Chilli instead of Chicken on my nachos. When the food arrived, it looked great. My nachos were awesome, big portion, great Chilli and cheese combo. My husbands burger sliders look great too, with big homemade fries. Only one thing, the meat was medium rare. We informed the waitress, and she stated she told us that was how they are prepared. Only problem is that he wanted them well done,and That option was never offered. The waitress took them back, and had them prepared to his liking. Once they came back, they were great. I guess I would go again, it's convenient if you are staying at the MGM , and has very nice sporty atmosphere.",

Walked up a little ramp sober into boxed shaped Sports Bar precisely 360 so if you're trying to hide forget it!  The scattered flat screen TVs align the place to accommodate views in every angle.  Bartenders along with some patrons sporting their favorite team jerseys fill the place. Bartenders were genuinely friendly and we had fun talking with them. I was indecisive on which beer (typically i am not) when the bartender let me taste.  He then told me what I \"should have\" and just said \"here\".  I kinda liked that because he was so good, knew his taps and after hearing what I typically like in a beer came up with the right beer for me.  We ordered the chicken nachos to soak up the alcohol which was surprisingly very good and plentiful!  Walk down the little ramp tipsy and outta there feeling good.",

Then we ordered an appetizer and five minutes later our loaded fries come out. Then we order our main course and they come out within 10 minutes.

Service was pretty terrible... our server/ bartender Randi was really nice and sweet, however when it came time to pay the billl (which we had a comped code for) she messed up the transaction and had to get her manager. HE took about 30-40 minutes trying to figure out the issue... he literally just disappeared for 30 minutes.... the least he could've done was come back and say he's still working on it, or SOMETHING?!   In the end though, our meal was comped (through gambling enough) and the manager figured it out. Great place to come check out sports, but don't expect more.",

We found ourselves standing in line to be seated at a nearby resto (ehem..Rain place with no rain - it was broken)just to be told it was a 45 min. wait. DIE, I've eaten all the snacks in my purse and my stomach was already touching my back. No choice, I'll wait. Told my hubby to run across to TAP and check there wait and whadda ya' know ? THERE WAS NONE (Sat night around 8ish). Actually he was told 15 min but by the time I walked over, he was flagging me down to hurry because we were ready to be seated.       Our server, was fast, efficient and detailed. We ordered and within 10 minutes, Dinner was served. Everything we ordered had huge portions and was super tasty and flavorful.

It had arugula, (what I think were) grape tomatoes, peppers, (get this...) watermelon, topped with feta and a vinaigrette. I would never have thought to combine watermelon and arugula but it was delicious and refreshing! Talk about a salad I'll never forget! I also had the chicken tenders after, which were also very savory and tasty. The customer service through out the restaurant was excellent. I was greeted at the front with a smile and my bartender was very attentive to my needs. I shouldn't fail to mention that Tap boasts flat-screen TVs that enclose the restaurant with sports feeds from all over the world. As a sports fan and someone who loves to eat, this place was pretty much perfect for me. But I have to say... That salad was pretty much the deal-sealer for me to have to post about it on Yelp.",

Not a lot of great places to hang, if you ask me, and not a hotel I would think twice about.  BUT, that damn arena, T-Mobile - (we were seeing a show) (see my review for that place-HATE IT) is right there and if you need to eat and drink, you want to be close.  I will say, Tap has good beer.  Our waitress, Ashley, was great.  We asked about the IPA's and she went straight to her manager to see what we would like, and hooked us up.  My man had the Philly sliders and loved them.  I am proclaiming a bit here -  I have other reviews of \"fish and chips\" - Tap - fish and chips -THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD, so ignore my other reviews of fish and chips ANYWHERE, if I posted one.  I think they use Panko bread crumbs for their breading - it is the BOMB.  Light, flaky, tasty.  The presentation is great.  Their tartar sauce has a hint of green onion, that is just fantastic.  You can dip your fries all night!  So, wrapping it up.....MGM sucks, but give Tap a try if you are around and craving beer, good food, and great service.",

She then says \"the bar has the full menu.\"  Ok - no problem. Sounds cool.  Then we sit down & the bartender/server comes up to take our drinks. We asked for the food menu & then he says \"we're already way past last call for food.\"  We then looked at each other & he could sense the frustration & says - \"if you want to order a quick appetizer I think I can get it in but you have to order now.\" We quickly ordered something.  Then we order our drinks.  Guy asked us about four times over what drink we wanted.  Dude could barely understand Englidh and if course he gives us the wrong drink.  We just kept it because our efforts would just be wasted.  We're easy going people so we'll not make a fuss but later just not go back.  So here's a question.... Why did they tell us we could eat the whole menu if they were already past last call?  Second question... Why the hell do you close your kitchen by 11:00 on a Fridsy night?  - that's just stupid. At a minimum just switch to a bar menu.  Honestly this place sucks.  I don't know where they got these idiots to work here but I guess Vegas/US must have a shortage of people looking for work.  I could hire a better staff at the local soup kitchen.",

We ordered the spinach dip, buffalo wings, sliders and Thai salad and all was delicious and satisfying.  I wanted to try their brownie for dessert but got too full!  I'll definitely come back again.",

I tried my hardest to finish it because it was that delicious. You won't be disappointed by not getting beef. The beer and mimosas were on point, shout out to the bartender. The fries tho- as easy as fries are, those were some of the best too. So excited to come back and try everything else!!!!",

When we arrived the restaurant was about 20% full. Mostly everyone was at the bar and there were just 7 tables that were full. We were one of the tables that sat waited about two minutes to sit since they were cleaning it. We sat and 5 minutes later we were greeted with a water runner. Our server didn't come by the table to say she'll be right with us or that she's busy or anything. Possibly about 20 minutes later she came by saying what we'd like to drink. We were irritated so we told her were all ready to order everything at once. Timing of the food delivery was good but once the food runner dropped off our food and we ate the food not once did the server come by to ask if everything was okay. She helped clear the table after we were finish and she didn't come back to the table!! It's been about another 15 minutes after we were finished with our food and we had to wave down our water greeter to grab our server to hand us our check!!   Why didn't she just drop the check when she was bussing our finished dishes? By the time we were asking for our check I saw that she only had 2 tables. We saw her near the bar service well chatting with her co workers. Also saw management in the front of the host stand not paying attention.",

A lot of the usual suspects when you think mainstream craft beer.  -Service was great.  -Atmosphere was typical of a sports bar. Think Buffalo Wild Wings meets Yard House. Except YH has way better beer.  -I liked we could do 1/2 and 1/2 onion rings and fries with our meals.  -Good presentation and big portions.    Cons: -I ordered one of their signature burgers. It was fine, but you can get phenomenal, life-changing burgers on the strip. If you want a burger, go somewhere better. This burger was very average and a bit dry. I also ran out of bun well before the patty was all gone.  -Fries and onion rings were very salty.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  We wandered up to Tap Sports Bar looking for something fast and easy to eat after seeing KA.  There was not a wait (it was a Tuesday night around 9:30 PM) so we got right in.  We liked the atmosphere and abundance of large TV screens.  Their menu contained typical bar fare (hamburgers, onion rings, etc.) along with a couple of surprising items like fried s'mores.   The difference between Tap and other sports bars was the prices were a little higher higher than a typical bar.  I would not expect burgers to be between $17-$21 in another sports bar, but this is the MGM.  Even though they were not very busy, service was slow so we had plenty of time to peruse the food and drink menus which were attached to wood boards, a cool idea.  After ordering a couple of beers, I picked the Tap burger on a pretzel bun with grilled onions and a fried egg and halfzies (half fries/ half onion rings)- $21.  It seemed a little pricy for this meal when I ordered, but it really was fantastic so I didn't care.  The burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned well and the onion rings were a devine treat.  The burger was pretty huge, I finished almost half.  The BF got the Bratwurst- $12 with kraut and spicy brown mustard on a pretzel roll.  He said it was delicious.  We didn't have room to try the s'mores.  Maybe next time.",

This impressive bar boasts no fewer than 60 flat screen televisions and looks as if it could seat at least 175 people. I spied a $40 for a New York Strip and a Beer deal that peaked my interest and after discussing the idea with the very adept waitress, I knew I had a great strategy for dinner. Add the NFL action on the countless screens and this was a stone cold lock.  How was the food then? Righteous. The steak was broiled to a perfect medium rare and topped with butter (think Ruth's Chris) the served with \"smashed\" (mashed) garlic infused potatoes and vegetables. The included beer didn't hurt the value proposition either. Not a bad way to catch a game and get some work done while having an agreeable meal.  TAP Sports Bar is 4 stars of funk all day.",

This shake has alcohol, my nephew is legal age but takes medication that cannot be taken with alcohol. We told the waitress this was the wrong drink to which she replied \"oh it's ok, there isn't that much alcohol in it\". She came back and informed us she spoke to the manager and he graciously offered to make the drink we ordered but that we would be charged for the one with alcohol. I insisted on speaking to the manager, told him how unhappy I was with this entire ordeal. Finally he agreed to only charge us for the lesser shake, which I felt was too little for all of that trouble. We paid and left never to return.",

    "text": "So, a friend and I came here to eat, as it was late, and it was half way between our two hotels (neither of us were staying at the MGM).  Let's start with the service - mainly because that was probably the best part. It was great! Our waitress came over just after the hostess sat us down. She was attentive, friendly, and had a wonderful smile.  I ordered the mudslide shake, and my friend had the Cadillac sized margarita. The mudslide was delicious, but went super quick. It had just the right amount of alcohol and sweetness - I would get this again. My friend's margarita was well made. It was much stronger than she anticipated - she ordered two of them. As for the food, we split an order of the steak nachos. Wow! It was a huge plate, and it had a ton of meat and toppings. The flavors went well together.  The only reason this place doesn't get more stars is the price. Although my friends Margarita's we're strong, they were not very big for being Cadillac sized. The price tag one them was pretty steep as well. Based on the price we paid for our meal and drinks, this place should add an extra dollar sign on it's description. $100 for nachos, a mudslide, and two margaritas? Probably won't do that again. However, I guess it is on the strip, and everything did taste good. Still, was it worth it? You'll have to see for yourself.",

I think it is a pretty good spot to watch a game and they also played some music videos which was nice too. The mood was very chill, they had a center bar you can sit at or tables around the bar. The place is pretty large, and the food smells really good, also that fry-mess really forced us to have to get more food even though we just had dinner.  Service: it was a bit slow. The place was busy, but not exceeding their table limit. Our waitress did a great job initially, but it took a while to get the check. I think she ended up with a lot of tables needing things at the same time.  Food and drinks: again I only had their nachos for food. Obviously being on the strip, everything is more expensive, but sharing the nachos wasn't too bad. It was actually really delicious, the chips were warm and toasty, and the condiments, guac and really warm melted cheese topped it off perfectly. I would definitely not mind coming back for more.  Their beer options were vast, and they had a 10percent beer which I had. It was strong, and dark, but pretty awesome to try.   Overall, great spots for sports, kicking it with friends, good nachos, and a variety of beer. Only thing that would set it back is the price.",

We started with two orders of wings (ten pieces for each order).  One of our party had a custom burger with an egg and I had the Asian Chicken Salad both nights.  The Salad had a good amount of chicken and the flavors were balanced.   I would have given TAP four stars if it were not for the price.

Not looking for anything in particular. Just a place to sit and enjoy some food and drinks. We found Tap Sports Bar inside the MGM hotel. Very similar in appearance to any commercial sports bar you have already frequented. Buffalo Wild Wings quickly comes to mind. Mind you. That isn't an insult. Places like these I welcome. Big screen TV's throughout. Sport's memorabilia on the walls. Beer by the pitcher. Things I love. The server Ashley was very nice and friendly. We kind of opened up to her about our flight situation beforehand. So instead of blowing us off. She took it as a challenge to give us a good time. With her great attitude and great suggestions for our lunch. She did just that. We ended up having a great meal. Food wise, the menu is sports bar food. Burgers, sandwiches, hotdogs and fries are your typical fair. But again, nothing wrong with that. It's what I expected and wanted. The food is good, hot and on point.  Overall a solid sports bar. Great drinks. Good food. Great service. Glad we found this place. We will be back next time when we are in Vegas again. This place is a winner.",

With it being in the heart of MGM and the fact of it being a sports bar attracted quite the line. We waited roughly around 40 minutes for a table, but from observation people were taking their time in there watching the games so I mean you either accept that as the norm or honestly find somewhere else to eat. It did actually go fast when you,occupy yourself with people watching or conversing amongst your group.  The restaurant itself is quite huge and does seem to accommodate quite the mass of bodies. Staff wise, they were very tandem with procedures and did seem to be on top of things which seems taboo at times in Vegas eateries.  As for the food their were a couple different options that called my name, but in the end I set my sights on the Philly cheesesteak. It is served in the styling of three mini sandwiches which at first glance seem like you'll leave with an empty stomach, but was very misleading as I struggled to finish #3. The bread itself was lightly salted pretzel bread, but was surprisingly soft (definitely a high point) through each bite. The steak itself was thinly sliced sirloin I believe, but was actually tender and a perfect spice to it as an added bonus. To top it off (as seen in the picture) the cheese was abundant to the point where it was borderline overpowering although who doesn't love the whiz? All in all a well put together cheesesteak, but does it beat an authentic one from the East? Yeah right..Haha  I would say Taps for both bar food and drinks? Yes. Taps for a casual dining experience? Maybe not.",

    "text": "Needed a hearty meal after spending most of the day at Wet Republic under 100 degree skies. We had tried to go here late the previous night but their kitchen had just closed. My friend Jeff T had his mind set on some nachos after seeing them on someone's table as we passed by the night before and I was in the mood for a burger. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated right away at a booth. It's a very modern sports bar. I like the way they did it up. Lots of iron piping. Lots of wood decor. The booth we sat in could have seated 6. It was a sizeable table. We were told the name of our server as we were seated by the hostess and within a minute he kindly came over and introduced himself and took our drink orders.   As I said, I was wanting a burger and I decided to build my own. It's in the section of the menu called Game Day Burgers ($18). The opening lines is your patty and I went with a Tap grind patty. The under/over is the bread and I had the grilled onion roll. The teaser is the cheese and I went with good ole american. And the odds on favorite is their added toppings. Each one is $2. I added bacon. I really liked my burger. It was tasty. It was big. The ground patty was cooked medium like I asked and the melted cheese was great. It came with 2 slices of tomatoes, onions and lettuce. It was speared with a wooden pick with a pickle. No pickles for me... Good burger. It filled me up and I was starving at the time. The steak fries were good. All it needed was ketchup for dipping. Nice crisp fries. Lightly salted.   My buddy Jeff T got the Tap Nachos and it was a big mound of a whole lot of food. He opted to add chicken so that was $4 extra. The nachos come with guac, sour cream, pico de gallo and jalapenos. Jeff T seems to think it would be best served with some beans. I tend to agree. Some refried beans at least woulda made this even better. Like I said, it was a big order and only half was eaten. The rest boxed up and taken to go for hotel room consumption.  I had to deduct one star for the lack of beans in the nachos and for my order missing onion rings because you can order halfzies which have both fries & onion rings with your burger. I was so hungry I didnt say anything. It was a regular sized side order so its not like I was lacking quanity but the variety factor was missing being that our server was the one that suggested it. I apologize that I do not recall his name. He was an excellent server other than forgetting that one thing. He checked in on us often but never bugged us. He refilled our drinks without us having to ask. We left him a good tip... I would certainly eat there again. Tap Sports Bar. Good food. Good time.",

Steve poured me a sample of a Dogfish 120 from keg, after handing me my flight of five beers which I chose from the draft list.    Had to snack here also.  The buffalo wings were really good, except that they came with Ranch at first, then Steve replaced it with Bleu Cheese and I could call the wing experience a 8.9/10 (great).    In all, quality beer and food experience.  Plus the atmosphere was as chill as you can expect from being embedded in MGM Grand.",

We like the food and the atmosphere better than that at the Rainforest cafe. Especially when you're over 12 years old. And it's probably better for the revenues than the lions that have been here before. I miss them..........  We've visited this sportsbar twice. Friendly and prompt staff, big tables and boots. All the food is a bit too salt. And that means it's really salt, because normally I'm the one that puts on extra salt. Not here. Portions are huge. And if your fond of salads, make sure to ask them to be light on the dressing. Standard the salads are drowning in the dressings.   Will we be back? Probably yes. Not for fine dining, but for a quick bite to eat conveniently located inside the MGM next to the poker room.  And excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language.",

We were in Vegas for five days for a birthday party event, but for about three days, all of us were running back and forth from the bathroom and couldn't enjoy everything...  We think it was maybe the buffalo chicken sliders we ordered because either the slaw sauce on it went bad, or the chicken was undercooked... the portions are generous but still pricey for a sports bar. Even though it is Vegas, 1 round of 6 shots, 2 beers and and appetizer with the chicken sliders put my total at ~$140.00 including tip. That was just my tab. It was just the kind of laid back, not uppity atmosphere we love and that we could frequent more than once on a trip, but we probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Vegas is full of overpriced restaurants with mediocre food. We found this place wandering through the MGM Grand on the way to a comedy show. Didn't have time to order mains but had drinks and appetizers before our show. Ordered off the specialty drink menu, and man they were good. I got a raspberry cocktail that was delish and hubs had a margarita that was solid. Warm pretzel appetizer was so good. It was served with pretzel nuggets and a creamy white cheese with mustard.  But here's the real deal. The nachos. Hubs & I are obsessed with the big, messy pile variety of nachos and not big lovers of the neatly arranged plate of a dozen moderately topped round tortilla chips. The big pile at TAP is as good as it gets. We got ours with chili, and that chili is so good! Big chunks of beef that just fell apart with the fork, perfectly seasoned. They are fully loaded with sour cream, guac, pickled jalapenos, and basically all the stuff you expect on a big pile.  And yep. It's a sports bar. Woohoo! Screens visible from every angle. We'll go back just for football next time we're in Vegas. I'm watching football now and wishing I had a pile of those nachos to go with my game.  Loss of a star for slow service. It wasn't that busy when we were there, and our server just didn't seem with it. She was pleasant just not all there.",

Expansive in size with diverse seating options flanking a central bar as televisions and memorabilia decorate the walls the TAP experience is truly a sportcentric one as a well-trained staff of jersey-clad severs circulate to the sounds of the game as opposed to some hideous Journey ballad generated via Touchtunes and although both food and beer menus trend small the selections themselves prove both unique and well-culled.  Clearly featuring a West Coast bias amongst its patrons and showing the NHL on every screen it was with a trio of beers and five appetizers that our meal began and with cheese as a theme it was actually the meaty chili in a bowl of buttery cornbread that impressed most and although I'm told the Onion Soup was quite bad both pretzels and herbaceous curds proved competent while man n' cheese bites were surprisingly light and rife with sharp cheddar.  Moving next to main courses after a near-hour lull it was in a quartet of options that we invested and although the open-face sandwich was delivered both dry and cool to the touch while thinly pounded pork proved far inferior to that at Hash-House-a-Go-Go it would be difficult to find fault in either the smoky Sloppy Joe atop one of the city's best buns or the innovative Corned Beef-style short rib with ample spicing and meat literally falling off the bone.  With more beers, more chat, and a Gaborik goal tying the game it was finally in desserts that we indulged and although none of the options are prone to wow on the level of those at Lagasse's Stadium both the Guinness Shake and substantial brownie were plenty rich enough to share while the deep fried s'mores and sidecar of fudge are an indulgent mess well worth making.",

I also tried the French fries and onion rings that my cousins ordered. Both were cooked to perfection.  However, good service is also a huge factor when going out to eat. And our waitress was super lacking in that regard. A young blonde girl, she seemed chill at first. But I'm not sure if it's because we were a large party of 11, but we caught her rolling her eyes when e asked if it was possible to split the check before ordering. And anytime we'd ask for something she'd make an exasperated face. She's lucky gratuity was already added or else we wouldn't have left her much of a tip, if any at all. I might be able to sympathize if she was having an off day, but if customers are being polite in their requests, there's no need to take it out on them.  All that said, I'd be willing to try this place again. Except next time I'll sit at the bar.",

    "text": "If you're a guy on a business trip or convention this is the place for you. I love their little high end rustic bar feel they have going on. They've got televisions everywhere in every sports channel you could think of so this just might be that go to spot to watch the game and down a few drinks with the boys. This also looks like a good place to take clients for business meetings. It's casual but decent and presentable so it helps give that inviting vibe to easily start conversation.  They're offerings look good as well. I ordered the chicken strips, but even those I was impressed with. When it comes to chicken strips, the tenderness of the chicken and the breading tells all. Their breading is so different, it is crunchy just like how you'd like it but the texture and flavor is nothing like the typical. It kind of has a different taste to it...maybe beer battered? But I'd recommend this one.  Other recommendations which I hear is popular: *The reuben sandwich *Fish and Chips *Fried mac and cheese *Fried green beans *Loaded nachos  Definitely more tailored for the fellas, and probably not the best place to take someone on a date (unless she's into sports or she's ok with losing attention since you'll be watching the screens...lol)",

Other food is great too,  though the Hawaiian burger was panned.  Alex is a great,  personable bartender.  Very good beer selection.  Good bloodies.  Love this spot",

Honestly I wasn't feeling hungry and thats because my body was still in shock at what happen four days earlier! But I had to get something in my stomach before we hit the road back to SoCal. We both actually kept it light and ordered off the starter side of the menu. I got the cheese curds and my friend got the corn dog with a hunk of meat in it instead of a sausage or hotdog.  Both items I tasted were okay. I did not like the ranch that was served with my cheese curds. I rather have marinara sauce to dip with instead. Service was good and that is all I have to say about this place. Will I return? Probably not and that's because there so many other places in Vegas to eat at, so unless an establishment is hella super good, its not worth going again.",

This one caught our eye after being told the buffet was closed.  So we were seated right away.  Our server couldn't be more attentive.  Explained the menu and told us some options since i didn't want too much eat being late!  So i opted for a side caesar salad because a full salad was huge. It was fresh and the dressing was homemade. I ordered wings.  They were good!  I got half buffalo and the other half birch beer (being from pa caught my eye) my husband got the open faced steak.  The steak was tender and he really enjoyed it!  Drinks were good too!  Being a restaurant owner i give you guys a A+!!! We will be back again!!",

When my party of four asked to watch the Warriors vs. Hawks game on Monday night, we were told by the hostesses that on Monday night, there is only football.  They refused to show basketball on one of their 60 flat screen TVs.  Even though, I pointed out that one of the TV is showing hockey,  they refused to let us watch basketball.  The place was hardly full and not everyone was following the game on TV.  Since this is Las Vegas, we found other places that were more accommodating and with better customer service.",

You can also choose the same beer more than once if you run out of ones to try or just don't see anything else you like. Get the cheese curds!",

We started with the soft pretzel- cooked perfectly and served with a standard, but delicious cheese sauce and (if i recall correctly) an even better smoked gouda cheese sauce.  After stopping by to greet us, the manager Jeff came by a second time to see how our drinks had came out and provide his recommendations for dinner.  For my main course I had one of the current specials, a Kobe beef new york strip that could have easily embarrassed most steakhouses.  My friends opted for the manager's favorite, the captains burger, which also garnered rave reviews.  Our waitress was attentive and good about keeping our drinks full.  Definitely a great experience that will bring us back during our next trip to Vegas!",

Which I thought was amazing . after they were seated us , our waiter Nikki came by and answered my question on what a goblet was , which she was very knowledgeable on what it was and why they serve it in that certain glass . After that she took our drink order and she was able to explain the drinks that we were questioning and suggest items. She offered if my boyfriend didn't like the drink that she would switch it out . After we figured out what we wanted ,  She took our food order . And the food did take a while but that's okay because they were busy . Through out the whole time we spent at TAP, Nikki was checking on us, making sure we were okay. I use to work in the food industry , so I have very high standards for food service and customer service , Nikki went above and beyond .  She was super duper friendly and enthusiastic , as I sat there eating my wings, I saw that she had multiple tables and she was interacting with each table , the same exact way as she interacted with us . She is definitely a valuable employee, employees are hard to find that work hard and that have great customer service. Please please acknowledge her and her great customer service .",
