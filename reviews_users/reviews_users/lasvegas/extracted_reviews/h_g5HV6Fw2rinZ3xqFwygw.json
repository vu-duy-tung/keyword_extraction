It was Sunday Brunch and the selection was decent. I enjoyed the small portion chicken fried steaks with biscuits and gravy. Salad selection was okay, only iceberg and romaine lettuces. Sushi selection was minimal each time I went back. Maybe my first time at a buffet and not eating sushi :(  I was impressed they had a Mimosa/Champagne Bar with at least seven choices. I didn't bother to ask if it was complimentary or if you had to pay.   The cream puffs were yummy and went well with O's chocolate ice cream--I added some to my filling! Yum! ;p  Good food for a decent price, considering we're not much of buffet eaters.",

The seasons buffet is a great deal at $9.99 monday - friday lunch special. The fish tacos are must they are made fresh and taste great. I tried the brisket and it was tender and juicy,well paired with mashed potatoes. They also have made to order pasta with all sorts of sauces. They also have chinese food to chose from. Overall the buffet was delicious with fresh selections to chose from.    Ps: make sure to visit the fish aquarium next to bass pro shop",

Once I'm in the buffet, lines move fast and I'm seated right away! My family and I have been here a couple of times and each time the variety of food is great! The Italian area has amazing pizzas and pastas, the \"American food\" section has great potatoes , corn, and fried chicken, and the Mexican food area has great beans, rice, and tacos! The ice cream and pie selection for dessert is amazing! Soft serve is boss! I highly suggest the Seasons buffet at Silverton!",

It's not the best buffet I've ever been to, but it is decent enough that I don't mind coming back here from time to time, especially when a family member has a free buffet coupon to use.  I know it's silly, but I love that Seasons has honey mustard as one of its salad dressing. It's my favorite salad dressing and I don't often see it at other buffets. The food itself is good, nothing fancy or life changing, but good. You can order a plate of custom pasta from the pasta counter which is nice and there's always enough food that I like. There is also plenty of food that looks greasy and unappetizing to me.  The dessert counter is where Seasons Buffet fails though. For as often as I go to Seasons, I find a lot of their cookies and cake slices dry and difficult to eat. Only once did I find a moist cake to eat, their Boston Cream cake, and I was so surprised.  Like I mentioned before, Seasons Buffet is okay. I'd recommend only coming here either if you have a food coupon or it's Polynesian night and you want to spend $19.99 for all you can eat poke.",

My husband is very allergic to seafood, and choose a ravioli entree which we thought was cheese, but turned out to be lobster.  Once I tried it I stopped him before he took a bite. Spoke with the chef, and they didn't know what was in the food and the label only said 'chef special'.   Besides the drama this was a huge waste of money.",

Our server (whose name I didn't catch) was very attentive-our plates were cleaned quickly and our drinks were always full. The sushi selection was pretty sparse, but they were all pretty good. The ahi poke tasted like straight onions. I took two bites and tried to make myself like it, but I just couldn't. The teriyaki beef and meatballs were both delicious, as was the suckling pig. It was super juicy! Oh and the chili mint wings and huli huli chicken were awesome! The wings were sweet but spicy-just the right amount of heat! The dessert selection was vast. The little cups were definitely the best. The red velvet cupcake was pretty dry and the frosting on it was oily. Overall we had a pretty good experience, but it was quite a drive for us from Centennial Hills so it may be a while before we make it back.",

Aside from that, they didn't let my 8-yr-old get a discount, they charged her as an adult (and my daughter doesnt even eat a lot, shes good with just eating a plate of soup and rice. I literally paid $20+ for soup and rice, where's the justice in that???). The server forgot to refill my husband's drink and we had to call her TWICE for it. Food was ok, it wasnt really that great, they had a few selection. Although their BBQ beef ribs are great. The others just had too much salt, i guess. And im not the type of person who likes salt in food. Not coming back here again, theres a lot of good buffet places here in Vegas that are definitely better and not as overpriced.",

One of the cooks sliced me of a big honkin' piece of crispy skin, and I saw that no one was touching the pig's feet, so I asked for the ENTIRE front leg/foot :) the top half was very meaty and tasted more like Chinese-style roast pork, but from the kneecap down, it was totally inedible, just bone and tough skin. The ahi and tako poke were good, as was the lomi salmon and the 3 bowls of poi I had.  Dessert was kinda sad...no haupia, and slim pickin' on the rest of the sweets. The company was better than the food.Guess I'll stick to Island Flavor next time I'm in the mood for some Hawaiian grindz....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(12/365) \"Here, piggy piggy!!!\"",

I liked the beef cut, not sure if it was prime rib but it was a huge chunk of beef that they cut into slices for you.... I liked the chinese food okay, and the salad bar was ok.  I liked the meat when it was freshly put out (for example i kinda had an older piece of bbq pork i didn't like, but my husband got a new piece and it was pretty tender).  I liked the shrimp cocktail because they devein the shrimp, and it's easier to take off the shell.  The shrimp tasted pretty fresh! I've had like a boiled or tough kind of shrimp so this was pretty good.  The dessert wasn't too bad. Overall was pretty good considering we got it for free! We gambled there a couple of times, so Silverton sent us some coupons in the mail for $15 worth of free food, so we got free dinner AND gambled and made some money!  Usually I spend all my money and then some, but today we were kinda lucky on the Wheel of Fortune and the Goldfish game, hooray!  My previous go to affordable vegas buffet was Red Rock, but for some reason I've always felt like really super salty or bloated the next day... so far here at Silverton, the food tastes good and not too overly salty, so I am able to enjoy it more!",

They got rid of the tako (octopus) poke and the quality of the roast pig was bad, two of the main reason I go there for.  The roast pig was dry and completely cold, some gelatinous substance was even forming, almost wanted to throw up after eating a few pieces.  The ahi poke, which they do have, is a weird recipe I think they were trying to stretch it out by adding more veggie ingredients.  As always I am a fan because I get to stuff my face with lau lau, kalbi ribs, poi, huli huli chicken, made to order pasta, desserts, kalua pig and cabbage, but now I'm kinda debating if the buffet is worth the $20.99 for the Polynesian Night.  Every first Tuesday they have a buffet from 10:30 pm - 6:30 am for 6.99 because their cafe closes for monthly cleaning.  They close down most of the buffet and offer mostly breakfast items, crepes, sausage links, bacon, etc. They have made to order burgers and omelets which is the only items worth the $6.99.",

Mondays fifty percent off for seniors is their only saving grace. For five bucks there's always something to pick out among the offerings to make it worth while. Other than that, you're better off finding a place that's worth $15.00 a plate. This ain't it.",

I think they need more cashiers up front to hurry up the line. In general, really enjoyed the place. I also liked the steak and the different kinds of seafood.

It had a very gamely flavor.  On closer inspection I realized that there was no marbling and the fat was a very bright yellow.  They were serving horse meat and passing it off as beef!  When I pointed it out to the server, one of the hostesses came over to speak with us.  She offered to bring out the chef, but I told her it was unnecessary.  I had horse meat years before and never forgot the look or taste.  She took our comment card and we saw her throw it away.  We did another and turned it in to the cashiers desk.  Funny thing, as we left we noticed that they had changed out the horse meat prime rib and was now serving beef!",

The prime rib and mash potatoes were the only thing good they had going for them. The build your own pasta bar didn't even have all options available. Save some money and try another buffet. The Rio buffet is a better option, however it is more costly.",

    "text": "First let me say I am not really a buffet person. I prefer dining with a choice and I choose one thing and I am good. I do not really like to gorge on too many things. I did hoover between 3 and 4 stars for this place.  I chose 3 due to what happened when we first arrived. At 5:30 on a Saturday there was no line. We walked right p to the cashier. My dad really wanted to go here. Now he has a club card to Silver ton, and I had received a coupon in the mail for a 2 for one buffet so off we went. The cashier tells my dad this is not our card. Rally? it says silvetrton right across the card. Not once did he say your card is outdated, or why do you not go to the club booth and get an updated one , or wait let me call for you. Nope not once ounce of customer service. Honestly I could tell my dad was getting pissed, so I did not even think about running and getting one myself. My dad told the kid forget and paid him. 75.00 for 3 people. I was expecting a huge assortment of food for this amount of money. Honestly there was not that much to chose from. We grabbed some food sat down and I could tell my dad was very upset. He honestly felt disrespected as to how the kid was treating him. and he was not enjoying his 75.00 buffet. We asked our server Gabriel, who by the way was fantastic, to ask a manager to come and talk with us. Gabriel checked back with us to see if she had arrived we told him she had not. We explained what happened and he went to get her again. She did arrive and I told her what happened. She asked for my dad's card ,saw it was outdated, asked my dad to go with her to the club booth, she got him a new card then honored the coupon. Which of course was the right thing to d. My dad seemed relieved after this and really liked the manager and that she treated him with respect and not as an old man. We finished our meal, found Gabriel gave him a generous tip and were on our way.  Now I will say the food we had was very good. The desserts far too sweet. And our server needs a huge promotion!.  Will we go back probably not. I still think it is too pricey.",

Everything else - the pasta, cooked food, even the drinks - were bad. Though there was a large selection of desserts, most were terrible (between my friends and I, we tried many). The lemon meringue was particularly poisonous.",

Thankfully our server was good and took our drink orders fast. We were pretty thirsty. LOL The prime rib was really good and so were the stuffed crabs. For another $5 bucks it was all you can drink sangria. So of course I had to try to get my moneys worth on that. It's always fun to be a drunk mommy on mothers day! So all in all it was 35 bucks for 9 people..2 of which were free since they are toddlers. I don't think you can do any better than that on a holiday. I will come back for a deal like that anytime.",

Also if you sign up for the Silverton Casino players club you can also get a discount. Come early for dinner because sometimes theres a pretty long wait.   The buffet has a good variety of food. There's different themes through out the week. But one thing I must say about this buffet is that the crab legs are great. Theyre pretty fresh in my opinion and they also serve them hot. You just have to ask the ppl in the back to get it for you. The staff there is pretty nice. I always enjoy going to this buffet.",

We had a team meeting here. We came during not-so-busy hours and it was really nice.

It is very comparable in quality and pricing to the Feast Buffets at GVR and Red Rock, which are the feature buffets for the Station Casinos properties. Like you should do at any buffet, it's important to do a full assessment of the food offerings before choosing anything. Once you've analyzed the situation, then you can make well reasoned food choices and pace yourself as necessary. There always ends up being a few items that catch my eyes and allow me to leave full upon completion. A plus is that coupons for 50% off a buffet come regularly in the mail, which make the buffet an especially good deal. Since it's the closest casino to my house and the coupons keep arriving, I'll continue to come.",

You have to go to the player's club, get a player's card and then they apply the coupon to your account. Next you go to a promotion kiosk and print out their version of the same coupon which you take to the buffet. We were not informed of this beforehand and had to make 2 trips back and forth from the buffet to the player's club due to the misunderstanding. Not cool.",

Our server, Annette, ran circles around the other waitress. We never had an empty glass nor was there ever a dirty plate on our table. I will be back and I hope to have her as my server again!!",

    "text": "I came to Seasons buffet at the Silverton Hotel to meet up one of my BFF's and her fiance for dinner.   We stood in line and got a table for 5. They soon came after. I was impressed at how nice this buffet was. Food was actually good. As I mentioned before, I'm not a buffet type of person but I liked what they served. I saw that they had the traditional Hawaiian food such as lau lau, chicken long rice, and pork. Mostly known as lechon to the Filipino community. Yum! The lechon was good and tender. Skin was crunchy. I also had fried rice, cream cheese wontons, and the noodles. Finally a place with noodles which I was craving earlier. The waiter was good about refilling our drinks. The cream cheese wontons were huge and had a good sized amount of cheese. I wish I could have taken more pictures but I got caught up in the food and conversation with my BFF and her fiance.   For dessert, I got the sugar free desserts. Trying to watch my sugars. I got a small sugar free cheesecake and a small sugar free fruit tart. So good. Cheesecake tasted smooth and fresh. They also had the regular desserts such as fudge, red velvet cake and so much more. Wish I could have had more but I was already full.   The buffet was pretty pricey. It was $19.99 with the Silverton card and $21.99 without the card. Kids under 4 eat free! That's even great for my daughter. This was definitely worth trying. Highly recommend!",

They have a huge spread of food ranging from Breakfast(french toast) to lunch(smoked salmon). They have 4 different Mimosa's to choose from and the price is worth every bit of food.   The waiters and waitresses are pretty good about filling your coffee and clearing plates after your done eating.

They had every kind of cake and pie, great choices of ice cream and even a sorbet; cheesecake, red velvet cake and pound cake!  From The salad station to every station, Italian, Asian, Mexican and things in between. For $16 it was definitely great! We loved the very flavorful pizza, great bok choy, excellent chili Colorado, chicken seemed to be rotisserie, Mac n cheese taste like it came from the dirty, dirty south....YUM! We didn't expect much with the reviews so maybe that's why we're soooooo impressed! For a family of 5, it was well worth the BOGO deal! Also our server Annette was working hard and just a gem!

There was no time for guest service other than get them their drinks and clear tables. It took 10 minutes before we saw our server because he was swamped.   The food quality is substandard fare. The salad bar was one of my favorite stations because it had roasted beets. There wasn't anything special, but it was consistent and well kept. The shrimp cocktail were not bad either. Other than that, I would skip everything else.   Food stations ran short on a few occasions. Finding a plate, or some ramekins were near impossible.",

The place was maybe half full.  The food selection was I thought very limited.  The Asian area had noodles and fried rice. Lemon chicken which was very dry and over cooked. There was 3 soups. The egg drop was Luke warm. Didn't finish my bowl. The crab wonton were so over done. I took 4 and only ate one. This is usually one of my favorite.  Moved over to try the Italian area. Tried the stuffed manicotti which I thought was good. I should have put more sauce over them  a bit that was my bad. The clam chowder was very good.  They had fried catfish nuggets and planks. They were good.    I had a slice of pizza and it was really tasty.  The desert table was delicious. I ate 3 different cup cakes. They were moist and delicious.  I really wanted to try this place,which I am glad I did , but I don't think I would go back or recommend this place. There are several other restaurants located there and you may save a little bit of money and get better food.",

    "text": "August 12, 2011  This buffet is amazing!  I would have gave this place a 5 star rating if it weren't for the ridiculously long line and grumpy lady at the dessert counter.  Aside from that.. superb and highly recommended!  Pros:   +  The best Prime Rib I have ever feasted on   +  Inviting ambiance with spacious seating   +  steamed crab w/ the option to toss in flavors  Cons:   -  Lines are way too long    Okay, let me start off with the negative...  I met my girlfriend at Silverton since I was coming from work.  My girlfriend arrived at 4:30pm.  I arrived at near 5:00pm and we didn't get to our table until 6:15pm!  That's ridiculous!  Friday is Seafood day (which is the day we went) and starts at 4pm.  I was starving by the time we got in (good considering I was about to devour AYCE style).  Dinner on Friday Seafood night is $22.99 with your Silverton card.  This is a good price in comparison to the likes of Wynn and the M buffet.  I hated the wait, but was really surprised at the quality of the food.  The service was really good too aside from a grumpy worker in the dessert section.    Overall:   I would highly recommend this buffet to people.  This is overall the best buffet I have ever been to.  The quality, price, and service combined makes this an awesome experience.    Tips: *  Different days have different specials: Friday Dinner is Seafood Night Thursday Dinner is Polynesian Night (Hawaiian) Tuesday Dinner is Cowboy Night (BBQ)  (I'm not too sure about Tuesday being Cowboy night.. Call first if you are interested in this one.  *  Try the Prime Rib....AMAZING!  *  The crab laid out is cold crab.  If you want boiled crab, you have to ask for it.   *  Don't forget to get your crab sauteed in flavor. I got Garlic butter YUM!  *  Save room for dessert: a selection of sugar-free desserts.  I'd recommend the Cappuccino Ice Cream (this one isn't sugar-free).  *  Show up early to avoid the wait in line.    * Sign up for the Player's card for free buffet at Silverton.    *  Lunch hours end at 3pm and Dinner starts at 4pm.",

The rest of the food was hit or miss. In my opinion the crate your own pasta bar was the best option they had. Nice atmosphere, and the staff was okay. Helpful,but nothing to swoon over.  I was kind of shocked because I've been to other casinos with a WAY bigger selection. Wait. Im eating the icecream now and it is fantastic. I have changed my mind about the pasta being the best part.",

It's more fun to me! Yeah you have to work a little bit more, but at least you don't have crab falling out of its shell like aria and cosmos Buffet. The other two times I've been here, the crab sucked. Plain and simple, it was smaller - harder to snap and it tasted terrible. Now it's totally different!  You have 4 options on the crab. Cold, steamed, Cajun sauteed, or Garlic sauteed. Both sauteed were delicious!  Another part of this buffet that I enjoyed was the Asian section, the chicken dish and beef noodle dish was great. And the pizza was really good. I think this is one of the best buffets because of the food but how can you beat the price??? $17.99, for free champagne too?!? One of the best buffets for the money in Vegas!",

Then went for pastries and tried pecan pie...just awful  and finally settled for the strawberries which were delicious.

The food here is better than most casinos in Las Vegas including the so called best buffets at the Green Valley Ranch and at the Palms Casino so on and so forth... I highly recommend this buffet to everyone to come down and try not only is the food good but the prices are absolutely amazing I took in I think it was 45 people for under 50 bucks! Now you can't beat that for a Vegas buffet!!! I have no complaints whatsoever only a strong recommendation to go try it yourself!",

    "text": "I can't really complain about a $6.99 breakfast buffet that turned into brunch shortly after we were seated ;)  For breakfast they had bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, biscuits with country gravy, french toast, granola, oatmeal, country fried steak, potatoes Au Gratin, and a \"make your own omelet\" section. The country gravy was probably the best I've ever had! Not too thick and it was just oozing with flavor. It was so good we even poured it over our omelets. We went back to the buffet for breakfast seconds and that's when we noticed the whole other half of the buffet was now open for the lunch selection. They had an Asian food section with chow mein, orange chicken,broccoli Beef, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and fried rice; An Italian section with pizzas, pastas, and I believe they were opening up a \"build your own pasta\" section because I read some sign that read: First, choose your own sauce. And the salad bar with a few choices of soup. Since I was already kind of full from my first plate, I just got a bowl of tomato soup, which was very tasty. Don got a giant piece of brisket, which he described as \"ok,\" but within a few minutes the whole piece was nonexistent. Before we left, I checked out the dessert section which included assorted pies/cakes, gelato, gingerbread cookies, and breakfast pastries. I went with the gingerbread man because I was feeling a little festive. I only ate off his head, but it was nice and soft ;)  Tip *They no longer have the $6.99 holiday buffet since it only ran for about 5 days. THey only have a weekend brunch, but it's $17.99",

It's a few miles away from the strip so you'll have to drive/taxi, but certainly worth it. The have a great selection of items at the buffet; from traditional american to asian & mexican selections. The food was good quality & fresh and not lacking flavor, like many buffets do. The price was also reasonable. $16.99 without a coupon and it includes beverages (soft drinks), with an option to purchase alcoholic beverages for an additional cost. We have absolutely no complaints about the food. And I wish I could rate 4.5 stars instead of 4. The only critique I have is that they make it kind of hard to locate spoons (for soup, ice cream, etc.). And also, our waitress didn't come around as much as we would've liked for drink refills. We had to track her down once, which wouldn't have been a problem if the place was super busy, but it wasn't. Overall...very good! I would definitely come back!",

We went for lunch. Our buffet was comped because we joined and played in the Silverton Player's Club. The service was good more \"help yourself\" as opposed to what you'd experience say at the Mirage. However, I did notice the lunch buffet was only around 10.00 as opposed to the mega strip resorts being around 24.00 for lunch. I did not see what dinner cost was. The food was delicious and good quality. Overall the buffet was about half the size of the Mirage but remember you are paying half the price of the Mirage. I had the brisket and it was delicious! I also thought their traditional take on classics like pecan pie, cobbler, etc were awesome. They even had a sugar free section of desserts.",

I also enjoyed some of the whole pig - probably only available on Polynesian night. The kalua pig was good.  The prime rib was tough, dry (even mid-rare), and full of gristle. How can a kitchen ruin prime rib? A lot of items look to be \"take from freezer, heat, put out.\" Mostly, I found myself trying a couple bites before leaving it on the plate in hopes of finding something good.  Ice cream was soft and airy - not smooth and creamy. The pies were almost tasteless.   People behind the buffet counter looked exhausted and completely unhappy to be there. While not busy (first clue at 7:30 on Saturday night), I waited 30 - 120 seconds before getting the attention from a worker at the pasta and prime rib stations.  $55 for two with tip, so very expensive for what you get.",

They had a fair amount of choices available, from shrimp ceviche to pad thai. They also had meat options, which was pretty cool. One of my favorite things to eat was their king crab legs -- they give you these neat little tools to open the crab legs, and man, there was a lot of meat inside! The cocktail shrimp was good as well. If you're a bread-lover, they've got some great raspberry bread! Surprisingly tasty!  As for dessert, I'll admit their selection wasn't great, but it wasn't totally lacking. They had some good ice cream that wasn't too frozen nor too melted, which is how I like it. They also offered waffle cones for the ice cream! Bonus points!  One of the things I was impressed with at the buffet was their service. Our waiter was constantly available and always refilled our drinks -- even without us asking! At one point I gave my sister some of my iced tea (I poured it into her empty glass) and he even refilled that drink with iced tea even though she hadn't ordered iced tea to begin with!  Overall, I'd come here again -- I had a decent experience and pretty good food. Left without having a heavy feeling in my stomach and a food coma, yet I was extremely satisfied. If you want to stop at a buffet and have a seafood craving, this isn't a bad place to chow down!  By the way, the decoration is quite nice and the place is very clean and spacious!",

First off, one should be aware that the special dinner nights (Friday and Saturday) are slightly higher in cost (19.99 versus 13.99 on Sun - Thurs with player's card discount). But boy, what a spread this is! And all you really need to do is look around and see Hawaiians everywhere to know that this is the place to be for an awesome Saturday night buffet. I'm sort of a neophyte when it comes to this style of food but with the vast selections of seafood (no crab legs though) and even sushi, this was a good deal. And since we were able to use a 2 for 1 coupon, it quickly became a great deal! I'd eventually like to come back to see what this buffet is like on a non themed night but judging from the great ambiance and high quality, I'm not the least bit concerned about leaving disappointed.",

    "text": "First, let me explain my star-rating if I may..   NO buffet, not even the M Buffet will ever get 5 stars. Why? BECAUSE IT'S A BUFFET, that's why. Let's be real here folks, buffets are glorified cafeteria food, the same food if not a slight grade above employee dining food. So when we're talking buffet ratings, a 4 star deal, in my opinion would be the MAX.   When the stress of the day along with record temperatures leave my brain fried, I tend to not be in the market for even the most minor decision making. Though I am not a huge fan of group troff dining, it seems to be the best bet when undecided is the verdict for where and what to eat for dinner.   If you are not starving when you first arrive at the Silverton, have no fear, the hour wait just to be seated (even on a Wednesday) will have your stomach growling by the time your butt hits the seat.   Salad, soup are your usual suspects at any buffet along with the dessert station. But the Italian cuisine was delicious and not your typical spaghetti and pizza, they threw in some rolled eggplant, and fried raviolis, yum! The Asian area was pretty decent..well the noodles were good, the fried rice tasted like Mexican rice to me, which worked out considering they didn't have a Spanish themed station at all there! (weird).   The carving station: WOW, I'm not sure what sort of animal they slaughtered for the \"prime rib\" but it could very well have been a dinosaur. I've never seen a bone-in hunk of meat so large in my life. Since I'm not a meat eater this made my stomach turn and I quickly sprinted past the station to some more animal friendly choices.. such as mac and cheese (yum) and some fried fish.   Dessert was decent. I was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to peel a crunchy layer back from anything I tasted, it was all sliced and served fresh! Best part was cheesecake and ice cream (chocolate chip mint), worst, the pumpkin pie (ick!).   All in all, was it worth the wait.. sure, almost anythings worth the wait when your starving, ha ha. Would I eat there again, sure, why not.   Undecided on where to eat? Try the Silverton Buffet",

    "text": "Ok never been here before and I have watched videos of the buffet on Youtube. l knew it was cheap and a small buffet. I dont mind if the buffet is small as long as theres quality food. I went for the dinner once I arrived in Vegas. There was practically no one at the buffet on a early Sunday evening.   The buffet was quite small but what they had was decent. The Italian section had the usual pizza and pasta. I tried their gnochi and cheese ravoli and surprisingly it was really good. I also tried their Chinese section and everything there was very flavorful. In the meat section they had hand carved turkey which blew me away that it was so juicy and flavorful. They also had top round but wasnt interested. There was also roasted vegis and rope sausage. I didnt eat it but they also had a taco bar with carne asada and taco meat.   The dessert section was decent, pies and cakes plus hand scooped ice cream, few flavors but enough to satisfy.   Its $14.99 for dinner (regular night only, they have specialty night) with a player card and for that price its hard to beat. I was very surprised by how flavorful the food was even tho it was a small buffet. This isnt the Wynn or Caesars palace where the buffet is $50 plus per person. Trust me Ive been to both and sometimes quality over quantity.  Id definitely eat here again, just for the Chinese section, turkey and pasta and some ice cream. Nothing fancy but food done right. Its cheaper than eating a burger and fries and a drink at some places.",

Their lobster claws are very good and plenty!  They have great varieties of other seafood including shrimp, mussels, clams, raw oysters, and their New York steak is delicious!  Service was friendly and their desert selection is good.  We really enjoyed this buffet!",

    "text": "This review is based on their Polynesian Luau Buffet every Saturday evening. My family and I have been homesick and was looking for a place to enjoy a Hawaiian style dinner. We have been reccomended by fellow 9th islanders and my parents stumbled across an Ad inside Las Vegas edition of Kama'aina magazine and with the help of Yelp we decided to give this place a go. We haven't been to Silverton in years so we were bit surprised to see the upgrade throughout the property.  Once we arrived at 5pm, there was a long line with the familar Pidgin accent that was spoken among the many customers in line. The Aloha spirit was present including the many Ohanas(families) that filled up the Buffet. It took approximately 30min. when we finally got seated inside plus it didn't help that they we came across alot of Uncles and Aunties, Lol.   The food items that were present was abundant in selection and typical to what you would find in Hawaii. FYI, Hawaiian food is influence by 5 cultures that includes China, Japan, Philippines, Korea and Portugal. This unique blend of cuisine is known locally among Hawaiians as, \"local food.\"  The items that we had were, -Roasted Pork w/ the head of the pig. -Ahi Poke -Tako Poke -Lomilomi Salmon -Pork Laulau -Teriyaki Beef -Seaweed Salad -Cucumber Salad -Kimchi -Poi  and various items.  Everything was fresh and delicious with a few items that could use a little improvement. The Teriyaki Beef was a bit dry and the Ahi Poke was a bit salty but consistent with flavor. I personally like the Pork Laulau, which is pork meat that is wrapped up in Taro leaves and steamed. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere felt like we were back home! It would've been nice if they had a Hula, Polynesian and Tahitian Dancers to set the mood, Lol. Even having island style music play in the background would've been nice to have. Then again I could wait for the Pure Aloha Festival for the Entertainment. Overall, I would personally come back and take family and friends to check this Buffet out.  2017 Yelp Review #16",

    "text": "Great little mid-tier buffet.  As you know from my other reviews, I am not a big fan of buffets but the honey likes them.  We have visited during Polynesian Night and I have to say the roast pig was damn good eating.   The seats are comfy, the servers are nice and the buffet is clean.    The only drawback to our last visit was an incident with one of the buffet custodians.   The guy behind the buffet grabbed a can of something and sprayed it on a mess at the Chinese food station.  The spray also landed on the white rice and along the rim of the white rice.   It sort of freaked me out because my assumption was that it was a cleaning agent.  After inquiring, they showed me it was a food safe generic non-stick spray coating (Pam) and that it was harmless.   I still stayed away from the white rice because who wants Pam flavored rice?   They need to find a less intrusive way of cleaning.    Maybe I am over reacting to having food safe non-stick spray coating my food but it just turned me off.  Yet another reason I don't like buffets!",

The buffet has grown on me and there are some good items. I like the prime rib. It's never dry and is consistently good. The highlight is their fish taco station. Tacos made fresh and delicious. Don't forget to tip! The service is great and staff are friendly. The Polynesian buffet is popular and offers tasty fare. I've attended on occasion. The lines never take long to get through. The restroom is very close to the buffet. This buffet is average and will never let you down. If you leave full, thats good enough.",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars!  Although I'm a tad biased because we only visited on Saturday night for their Polynesian Luau dinner.  What can I say?  I'm from Hawaii!  We like a good luau!!  We visited the Seasons Buffet TWICE in a one month period for their Polynesian Luau.  First time was because got a coupon from a Hawaiian magazine that offered a 2 for the price of 1.  Second time was because the brother in-law was in town.  I handily admit...the 1st visit with the one FREE buffet was soooo much sweeter!  Mainly because it was cheaper.  I delve in cheap.  Except with health insurance, you can never be too cheap.  Of course, for a Saturday night the buffet was busy!  Line wasn't too bad though, maybe a 15 minute wait.  And lots of Hawaiians!  Can't be all that bad then, right?!  Go where the locals go!  OK - this being a specialty night with their Polynesian Luau, I stayed away from the other 'American' food for the most part to focus on the island eats!  All Hawaiian food for me, baby!  And I gotta tell you...I enjoyed all of it!  It was really almost like being at home on Maui...except the lack of a proper BEACH!    Food was ONO-licious!!  That means 'yummy' to some of you!  I get it, may not be the top in quality when compared to an actual luau in Hawaii but the effort is totally there!  The local Hawaii food we're used to was all there:  -FULL roasted suckling pig! -Pork Lau Lau! -Ahi poke! -Lomi Lomi Salmon! -Teriyaki beef! -POI! -Even Haupia!  I think I ate like King Kamehameha!  Multiple servings of everything!  I understand some of y'all think this kind of food is well...gross...but for a local boy this is a taste of home!  I definitely stuffed by belly full!  Quality of food was great too even with some minor missteps.  Roasted pig was good but wish the skin was crispier.  Ahi poke was good but should have had less onions.  Same thing for the Lomi Lomi Salmon.  Teriyaki beef was good but sauce shouldn't be runny, beef should be MARINATED in the sauce - not sauce poured on afterwards.  Poi was surprisingly pretty fresh, not sour!  Haupia was made like back home, perfect!  I'm not gonna complain about the price either for Seasons Buffet Polynesian Luau, cheaper than a luau back home!  With the Silverton player's club card, only $19.99 a person!  Totally good value for all you're getting!  And don't forget, you still get access to all the other buffet eats like prime rib!  Pizza!  Sushi!  Absolute food fest.  Had an excellent time at the Polynesian Luau at Seasons Buffet, we'll be back again for sure!  CHEEEEE HOOOOOOOOO!!!!!",

    "text": "The lack of quality at this establishment is inexcusable.  They don't replenish dishes, so when they're out, they're out or it takes them too long to refill/replace. This is one of most frustrating things at any restaurant at the Silverton, one of which I've even tried contacting a food and beverage manager about but was never contacted back. There never seems to be one on hand to speak to during business hours/ hours of operation either or they simply have heard it before and don't care. It seems that it's a combination of their employees being lazy to refill their selection and that they simply purposely don't order enough food to meet the demand that they have for their restaurants, so they try to \"ration\" it out.  Also, dishes on their line routinely are all over the map temperature-wise and in regards to salt content. One dish might be McDonald's-lawsuit-piping hot, while another will just be just sitting there mired in its own juices at barely room temperature. Multiple dishes were congealed/coagulated and looked gross. Couldn't a chef replace these dishes or at least stir them so they at least looked acceptable?  Flavor is not existent as many items are simply throw away reheat dishes from the freezer (i.e. their mix of carrot and peas, etc.). There really isn't any pride in their work,  both from the chefs on hand and the servers/ waiters/ front staff that seats you. Here it isn't that the customer is right or at least has something valuable that should be listened to, no, at this establishment the client/ customer is wrong from the get go. It's a pattern not only through this restaurant,  but across the board at their other restaurants. On this particular visit,  the most egregious things that I witnessed on top of the lackluster service and food was that there seems to be a bug infestation going on at the Silverton.  I saw multiple dead bugs inside the property at their foyer when you enter from the parking garage.  There were multiple live bugs in the foyer as well, such as a cockroaches (massive ones at that). I wish I had been able to take a photo of these bugs for this Yelp review, but they were/ are there and it's exceptionally gross. I cannot believe the health department hasn't denied their grade or suspended/ shut them down. I witnessed these and flies at their buffet as well. Simply gross.  You should really,  really think twice before coming to the Silverton because other than it being an ok/so so deal at some of their restaurants, the price you pay for health isn't worth with the bug infestation they have going on and the lackluster food/service.  It is really beyond me to give this place even 1 star. If I could,  I'd give them negative stars. It is also incredible that they have the general (stars) / average that they do.",

If I time it right I hit it on a Saturday which is Polynesian night where I spend a few hours devouring Fred. (Fred is the name I gave to the roasted suckling pig) Although, Old Fred is long gone his name still lives on in memory through is brothers and sisters who graciously offered up themselves (as Fred) every Saturday night for the firm price of $23.80 gratuity not included.  Besides Old Tasty Fred. This buffet offers up a lot of tasty Polynesian fare that one might miss unless of course you go to Polynesia. Or come here and stand in line for almost 2 hours with mostly Polynesian folks some the size and strength of tanks that could easily kill you with one punch. That being said,  you know the place is worth it. Some of my personal favorites are the Ahi Poke, Lomi Lomi, Tako Poke, Sushi, Kalbi Beef Ribs, Suckling Pig with Crispy Skin, Kalua Pork Loin, Pork Lau Lau. They also offer up a really nice New York strip steak as well as all the standard buffet stuff you normally find.",

I'm not filling up on salad at an ayce...so the \"prime rib\" was just ok & the au jus tasted horrible...but the ribs, both (smoked) pork & beef were really good...the Mexican street corn was probably the best thing I ate...I ate 3 of them...lol... the girls ate normal stuff but split a bao...they said they were just ok...not as good as what you get in Chinatown...they added salt... Donna's sirloin was over cooked...she said the shrimp scampi was her favorite...& I will have to say that it was perfectly cooked despite sitting there on a heat tray for god knows how long... the potato salad had too much pickle juice....the mac n'cheese was just ok as was the scalloped potatoes... I tried the Hot n' Sour soup...too spicy...just ok... My husband said the buffet was \"nothing special\"....he said the turkey sucked... but there were lots of things to choose from...salad bar...Asian stuff...Italian...Mexican... mudbugs...I tried one...over cooked... The dessert bar was nothing special...I tried the pecan pie...ehh...I tried the sugar free key lime pie...ehh...I tried the strawberry cheesecake pudding...that was good...except too much strawberry goo on the top... I tried the lemon gelato...ehh...tasted like they used fake lemon juice...Katie like the coffee gelato...",

    "text": "Seasons Buffet is exactly the kind of hidden joint I'd expect to find when exploring eateries outside of the Strip.  And although, it's not really all that totally off Strip, it's far enough away that your efforts to visit them will be rewarded with extra attentive service and better eats.  Best of all, Seasons easily outshines other similarly priced buffets with the sheer quality and variety of their offerings.  So, first of all, the place looks great: modern space with plenty of legroom so not to impend on the comfort zone of fellow diners, a back wall filled with enough tvs to watch the game and the Food Network at the same time, and best of all, each and every serving station is pristine.  I liked finding two buffet items normally not served during lunch: grilled veggies and brisket.  The brisket was tender and juicy.  It was a little under seasoned but if you dab a little BBQ sauce, it's bound to impress.  The grilled veggies were crisp, slightly caramelized, and probably one of the healthiest things I may have ever had at a buffet (is that sad?).  The showcase item was their fish tacos.  And I'll be the first to admit, they are exceptionally done.  The outer taco shell is crisp-ily grilled while the inner shell stays bendy enough to help house, not only the moist and tender fish, but all the fixings that make it so yummy.  My only gripe is that you're limited to only 2 tacos per order . . . which, I guess, in retrospect is pretty smart considering I'd probably go overboard and OD on them.  The desserts were a little disappointing . . . but to be expected for a buffet.  They were mostly bad but not completely terrible.  I was able to finish half a scoop of cappuccino ice cream and a sliver of cake; although, the fact that I don't remember what cake should say something.  Fortunately, instead of ending my outing with dessert I had one last order of fish tacos.",

Was looking forward to the suckling pig, but it was just ok. The poke was fresh, but needed more flavor. The Lomi Salmon was very bland! The rest of the food was alright, but nothing you couldn't find somewhere else. I did like the Haupia for desert, though! The service was good and the employees were friendly. My plates were quickly cleared and my drink was always refilled. If you're at the Silverton Casino already, go for it, but I wouldn't drive across town for it.",

    "text": "Note: This review is for the Polynesian buffet that the Silverton has on Thursdays, though I'm not sure much changes from the regular buffet.   I usually wouldn't go the Silverton buffet since we have so many other good places I'd like to eat but someone wanted to go so I decided sure why not? Have to try somethings at least once.  The decor: Not bad, it was actually pretty good, not completely amazing but not so cheesy and tacky that you're reminded that you're at a buffet and feel like a tourist. But pretty much what you'r expect from a buffet, one thing I didn't like is that the bathrooms are outside and in the casino, not that big of a deal for some but kind of bothers me.  The service: Excellent. Very attentive. Everyone was nice, conversational, relaxed and everyone just seemed real kick back.  The food: The primary purpose of going to a buffet. Can't say I was impressed by anything they had to offer. It wasn't the worst buffet I have ever had but all the food just seemed to be real basic. There was your Italian section - eh, you're Asian section - yawn, salad bar, small dessert area and a couple more areas that weren't very memorable. If you were hungry, it would've done the trick but my biggest problem was where was the Polynesian food? It seemed like their regular buffet with maybe 4 or 5 Polynesian dishes. They had some pig, mahi mahi, and pig/pork in banana leaves and that's about it, not a lot of variety and if I'm craving some Poly food again I can't say I'd rush back here.",

However, the quality of food is pretty good and the prices are really reasonable. Off the top of my head I recall, there were Asian, American, Italian, and Seafood sections, a small variety of salads and soups, a carving station with Turkey & Prime Rib, an area with some grilled veggies and large kielbasas, many different kinds of pizza to choose from and a good assortment of desserts. They also have a pasta station where they help create a fresh batch to your liking. I've gone here about 3 times now for lunch and it's roughly the same.  It's a great last stop before you drive out of town (lunch M-F is only $9 with Silverton casino card!).  Good buffet food at a very affordable price.  Tip: Get a Silverton Lodge Casino Discovery Club card.  It's free and helps you accumulate points for comps while you gamble. You'll also get a large coupon book which has a couple 2-for-1 's for the Seasons Buffet.  Also, if you are eating by yourself, you can also use the 2-for-1 coupon to just get 50% off instead! However, if you don't have a coupon you'll still get a discounted price for the buffet if you have the card.  It's worth getting!",

I find the quality of the food to be mediocre at best, The majority of their vegetables are canned; corn, candied sweet potatoes, Sauerkraut, peas and carrots, etc.  However, the mashed potatoes and broccoli are fresh.  I am a vegan, so that limits me and what I can eat.  I do like their pasta bar and their salad bar.  My weakness was the dessert bar.  The dessert bar used to be great, but they seemed to have changed bakeries.  Now the cakes are too sweet and very dry.   Our friends are not vegan, and they said the quality of the carving station was poor.  However, the turkey was pretty good, with a nice gravy. The price for the regular dinner buffet is $13.99, which is $1.00 less than the, Feast buffet at Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock Hotel.  The quality difference is like night and day, hands down, the \"Station's Feast Buffets\"  are far superior to Silverton's Seasons Buffet.",

Went there for breakfast and lunch only, so only reviewing for it. Good selection of normal breakfast/lunch fare. Can't recall all the items, but fried chicken is good (so I heard), as was the prime rib, and snow crab. Desserts were also good. From scratch, according to the hotels' website.

I remember when only a few months ago one would be waiting an hour or more in line on a Friday or Saturday night before reaching the cashier, then an additional 20-30 wait to get seated.  Last night (Friday) my wife and I thought we hit our own mega lottery when we saw no line to wait in.  We soon found out why. For the admission cost, using our gaming card, of 2 adults @ $13.99, a minor @ $13.99 and a child @ $6.99 we paid about $49 + added tip.  Unfortunately pre-tipping is a double edged sword.  Sometimes your server is more motivated to proved better service because they see you gave them great tip or they figure, mehhh, they got your $ so I don't care at this point.  Well, ours was in the second category..what a slug.  We had to ask for our frigging silverware.  Asked for extra napkins, and no, that does not mean just 1  each for the kids.  Drink refills, empty plate takeaways, don't get me started.   The food selection was abysmal!  The crab legs were removed from the buffet and replaced with a made to order bananas foster/cherries jubilee section.  (This is not mentioned on their website incidentally).  The self peel shrimp that shared the crab leg section has moved over to where the sushi was offered near the salad bar.  Yup, you guessed it...no more sushi offerings.  Let's see what else did they cheapen out on which is selected in their lower buffet price?  Oh yeah, they offer meatballs in their Italian section, but no pasta for them, yup, there's no pasta offerings at all.  C'mon folks, pasta is a cheap, buffet fill the masses up cheap category.  I fact, the only noodle type offering they had was chow mein.    My kids were disappointed as one of their all time faces at this buffet was the coconut shrimp, which was no longer offered.  The guy at the carving station was obviously in a pissed off mood the night we were there: he was literally dropping/throwing the meat on the plates anywhere.    The positives?  Hmmm????  The cabbage rolls were good, the carved beef, (when you recovered from your plate almost tipping over from the asshole chef flopping the meat onto it), the yams, the shrimp, the lemon chicken.  You get the point.  So I guess, we won't be returning to this buffet anytime soon.  For the same price, one is better off going to GVR;'s buffet that has a much wider election that is a whole lot tastier and better wait staff too.",

The cashier told me that it would be ADULT price for a 7-year-old. Excuse me? Since when is a 7-year-old the same price as a full-grown man? Do 7-year-olds eat the same amount of food as an adult?! At most places ages 12+ is the adult price. No thanks, I'm not paying $20 for my child to eat a dinner roll, fruit, and a dessert since I'm sure that is all he would eat there anyway. You obviously do not want families to eat there if you charge that much for a small child. Our large party took our business elsewhere. We went to the Mexican restaurant in the casino and they were very friendly and had lunch specials. Half the price and lots of food.",

First, it is easy to access (right by Highway 15) and it is easy to park there. The line at the cashier can unfortunately get very long though. I was there on a Sunday and since they had a BOGO deal the line was very long and it took us over almost an hour to actually pay and then get a table, when there were a lot of free tables available...   Once in there, service was good and the food decently good as well. This buffet is reasonably priced and you get food that really isn't that bad for a buffet. There is also a rather large selection of food options.  The main problem with this buffet is that they will kick you out after 90 minutes there! So be ready to eat and drink as fast as you can, which can be a problem since the lines at the bar are sometimes pretty long and it can easily take 10 minutes to get one drink. At some point, the bar ran out of clean glasses and I didn't get any drink for over 20 minutes...  To conclude, this is a pretty good buffet option, but be aware that logistical issues due to the way this buffet is managed might ruin your experience...",

A lot of their entrees had too much salt or lacked flavored. Beyond disappointed that nothing hit the spot besides the lau lau which was decent enough. To top it off I didn't even enjoy their desserts. Glad both times I came I did not have to pay as I was treated but even then I did not enjoy the food. Never coming back and our server sucked as well.",

    "text": "Not good at all or how I remember it from last year. We got to Bellini Brunch with a little less than 2 hours before it ended. There was a long line to pay as well as to get seated. There was a sign that said all guests were limited to 90 minutes because they were so busy. Thankfully it didn't take too long to get seated. As for the food, it was mostly yuck. The bad- The top round wasn't tender. All of us who had it could not cut through it or chew it. The clams weren't fresh and smelled like dirty ocean water. Mussels smelled as well. Carved turkey was dry. Fried shrimp tasted stale. The desserts were horrendous. The cupcakes were dry and crumbly. While the lemon curd cake was moist, it barely had any flavor. The coconut cake didn't taste like coconut but instead the frosting and filling tasted like vegetable shortening or margarine. I hate wasting food, but I spit out a lot of it!!!! The good- their pizza actually tastes delicious. The mashed potatoes were great. I love how they offer a ton of grilled veggies by the meat carving station. To make it worse we were there when they started changing out the Brunch items for dinner that started at 4pm. The people working were so aggressive in cleaning the place up. There were several times I'd be waiting patiently while they swept crumbs away and wiped down the counters in between serving trays. I got side eyed like I was intruding in their space. Or they would just jump in front of me like we were hassling them. I get it, Vegas is damn hot and can make both servers and customers miserable, but still! Made me want to leave, what horrible service! I wasn't trying to jack from the dinner menu, I was just trying to enjoy the 90 minutes at the buffet that I paid for. While this place is relatively cheap, $19.99 regular price, $17.99 with Silverton Rewards card, it has not lived up to what we experienced last time.",

    "text": "Oct Thurs BOGO review. Thru the month of Oct, sign up for a players card and get a coupon from one of the kiosks to print out a BOGO coupon for the same day. That comes out to about $5pp for a buffet. And you know what? The food wasn't bad! Now this isn't the best buffet ever, but for $5pp it served it's purpose.  The fish tacos are surprisingly good. The fish is grilled, not fried, so you don't have to worry about soggy fish. The fish itself is very moist and smooth. Lots of other standard buffet items, but what sets this place apart is the cooking stations. You can get made to order pasta, meat at the carving station, etc.   Another tip is to play some games the same day you get your players card. With only 50 points you get a coupon for another free buffet! We used it the following Sat for the Bellini Brunch. Surprisingly, the food at the brunch wasn't as good as the Thurs lunch. There were some standouts though. The eggs benedict was one of the best buffet benedicts I've had. The Hollandaise was make correctly. Very rich and buttery, with a nice kick of lemon tartness. There's prime rib at the carving station, and some ho hum sushi. Desserts were better on Sat tho.  The Bellinis available were raspberry, mango, sunset, orange, and another I'm forgetting.  I'd definitely come back again this Thurs to take advantage of the BOGO. Hey that's tomorrow! If you come between 2-3pm there won't be a line. We got in line right before noon and we waited 40 mins to get to the cashier. The dining room isn't that large, so all tables were full.",

We then went to the foods such as Meatballs, Prime Rib, Chicken etc. We had Mac n Cheese, Potatoes, Summer Vegetables, Rice Pilaf, etc. My husband sampled several Deserts. ALL the food was Fresh and Tasty. Nothing was old or over cooked. We sampled a little bit of many different offerings...............all great. We're going back this weekend (we're locals) to try it again. The bottom line is that the Seasons Buffet was a very different experience for us compared to other buffets in the area.",

I love getting fish tacos during lunch.  for the price of a 3 fish taco plate at a place like wahoo's, you can enjoy 3 fish tacos plus the rest of the entire buffet for the same price!!!  salad bar has all your typical fix ins.  there is a pasta bar which you can create your own tasty concoction.  there is Italian with pizza and pasta.  the Chinese section has 2 soups and favorites like orange chicken, pot stickers, and Singapore noodles.  there is a carving station that had beef brisket and corned beef.  my mouth is water just thinking about the food.  and this is just lunch!!!  Polynesian buffet is another story.  you've got lau lau, tako poke, ahi poke, chicken long rice, roast pig, haupia, lomi lomi salmon, poi, the list goes on and on.  and for $20 you can't beat the price.  if i am having a craving for Hawaiian, you will find me here on Saturday night!!!",

I recommend coming here right when they open for obvious reasons - food are freshly cooked. Line also tends to get backed up later on in the afternoon. Their beef brisket is pretty good and I love their liver with onions. They basically have flavors of the world. Fish tacos are also made to order. They also have a really good dessert selection. Try the fruit tart - you will not be disappointed. The manager who helped us was very accommodating to our large party. The employees behind the counters are the unfriendly ones. I still have yet to try this buffet for dinner but I'm sure it'll even be much better than lunch. Can't wait!",

    "text": "So let me start off with a basic fact about me...I am NOT a buffet person!  I will NEVER, EVER  suggest we go to a buffet.  I only go when I am outnumbered or when family is visiting. So take this review as you may.    I went here for the first time this week since I had family staying at the Silverton.  I have eaten at many of the restaurants there and have always been happy, so I was aware of the food quality level and just went with it.    It started off with us in a short line to pay and be seated.  Even though it was a really short line, it took over 25 minutes to get a table.  I'm not sure why, because there were a lot of open tables that I could see and they seemed to be adequately staffed, so I am not sure where the disconnect was.  So that just put me in a bad mood because I was pretty hungry.  Just a warning for y'all, when I get hungry, throw a cracker or something at me because I turn into that girl from the Exorcist when I am starving.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Next up, the food.  I was actually surprised how many sections they had available.  There was a soup and salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, American comfort food, Chinese, Mexican, roasted/grilled meats, and a dessert bar that included freshly made ice cream.  It wasn't a huge buffet, but i found plenty of items that looked and tasted pretty good.  No, it wasn't as big as the World Buffet at the Rio or fancy like the Wynn, but it was ok for what it was.  So yay for that surprise!  The service across the board was hit or miss.  Our table server was very nice and on her game.  She did great.  The hostesses were all a bit grumpy.  Some of the chefs behind the food counters were not happy to be there, but the chef at the meat craving station was just adorable.  The chef in the dessert section was happy.  So it was a little all over the place.  So Seasons is an average buffet for Vegas quality.  If you are a buffet person and in the area, it is an ok place.",

    "text": "I've probably been to this buffet more than any other buffet in Vegas because I live next to this casino. I have to give it five stars because I've eaten some incredible meals here.  If I've ever had a problem it is been with the staff that you pay at the front of the line.  Not any of the other staff that works in the restaurant. When issue we had was our two for one coupon was given away to a random person because they didn't check his ID.  Then when we got to the front they check their IDs and they still couldn't honor the coupon. The coupon would've saved us about $15-$20. So it was very annoying and we actually got an argument with the staff and that shouldn't of happened. Proving who we were with her IDs should have given us our hard earned coupon because we gamble there quite often.  We heard a lot of crap about \"policy\" blah blah blah but they didn't have \"policy\" for the other man they gave our coupon away to. But for the most part I'm vegetarian and there's a lot for me to eat here including Thai food or sushi on certain days.  My fiance is a meat eater and there is tons of meat on the menu. We both always love to eat here so we just try to ignore the cashiers who are kinda snooty and have a hard time with customer service.",

The restaurant had several televisions inside which displayed ESPN which was also a shock. The price per person was not that expensive either.

Yes, there were lobsters, but the \"crab stuffed lobster tail\" was more breading than one can imagine. The \"broiled lobster tail\", on the first round delicious, the second ewwwwe...no quality control. As for the \"stuffed crab\" that too was a wreck of breadcrumbs. Never mind about the clam bakes or crawfish bakes, I was hard pressed to find any meat. The \"shrimp and crab salad\" was a True gem if you're into bell peppers. Oh, and if you love spice and sesame oil, the ahi poke has plenty to offer, as an added bonus onions are heavily sprinkled throughout. And while the \"lobster tacos\" were made fresh to order, best to get those on your way to your table...cold tacos are not the business and the salsa seemed to get even spicier.  But! The big finale is their dessert offerings: pies with no flakey crust, the curious wondering of what is what and hand scooped ice cream that's more ice than cream. No, thank you!!!",

    "text": "I eat at MANY buffets around the country and I see many things, that many people would find repulsive if they paid attention. They do not pay attention! The fact is that MOST buffets are well put together and very safe to eat at. The food is nearly always very fresh.  The problem I see happens nearly always, as it did today right here at the Seasons Buffet. It is the frequently nasty habits of many of the patrons that will definitely spread germs. Next time you are standing in line waiting for the buffet, look closely at the people in line with you. Are they picking at their nose, putting their fingers in their mouth or just playing with their greasy hair? Did they even bother to wash their germ covered hands when they used the restroom just before coming to the buffet?   Some of the slimiest people you may ever see anywhere are standing right in the same line with you and some with their grubby little children, AND they will ALL in fact be handling the exact same serving utensils as you. BET ON IT!  Whenever possible I always like to be the first in line to avoid many of the disreputables, that put their hands on the serving utensils. Do this and you will avoid much.  It says that Seasons Buffet is the Best in Vegas. Who knows? It is not as good as the Sierra Buffet in Mesquite, but I have eaten here MANY times over MANY years and I have nearly always enjoyed it.   Sometimes the service gets pretty lame and especially if they are busy. I do not like to be eating for 15 minutes before the server even bothers to ask what I would like to drink. Other times it is very good.  Overall, most of the food here is really tasty and I like it. The salad bar is lacking. I compare this to the Sierra's Buffet in Mesquite (90 miles northeast on I-15), where the fruit and salad bar is far above reproach. I've never seen anything like it anywhere.  My favorite thing here after eating is to always check out the marvelous aquarium at the front of the Silverton and the other freshwater aquariums in the attached Bass Pro Shops. The BPS here in Las Vegas is the most impressive I've seen anywhere around the entire country. The visuals are amazing especially if you are an outdoors person. The whole place is highly recommended. A genuine Vegas experience!",

The most frustrating was the orange chicken had an aftertaste like cardboard and was super hard.   Try not to squander your time here, there are numerous different smorgasbords that taste much better in Las Vegas.",

This buffet has a pretty good variety compared to the bigger name casino buffets where you will pay for double or sometimes nearly triple the price that you would here. They have a Hawaiian night on Saturdays where they have everything from authentic Hawaiian dishes such as Kalua pork. It is nice to be able to go here when you want a little of everything. There is something for everyone to eat. I would like them to give a little more time to guests to get more food when they are about to close. 30 minutes would be better than the 15 minutes they give guests for last call.",

Even knowing the buffet would close in less than 30 minutes, the workers were still replenishing the food for those of us that showed up for a late meal.   Food was just really good and was probably as close to having that home-cooked taste that a buffet could ever hope to have. Probably also one of the few buffets I've been to where the sugar free desserts actually tasted good. Our server was super nice too and actually stopped to have a conversation.  We actually voted to eat here again on the same trip, but unfortunately arrived as they were closed for the switch from lunch to dinner so we ate elsewhere (and regretted it).",

Second to location is finding a place that could accommodate me having Celiac. I figured being a buffet it could accommodate us both and it did not disappoint. I asked one of the black coat wearing chefs to show me the unobvious items that had gluten. He came out from behind the buffet with the head chef and between the two of them I got all of my questions answered. The selection of non-gluten items was not vast, but what I ate was very good. They found out though that the sausages contain gluten and are cooked right next to the beef hot dogs which do not. I explained to the chef about cross-contamination. The beef brisket and turkey could be cut with a fork. The sweet potatoes were really tasty. The vegetables were not overcooked. Compared to the insanity of price at other Las Vegas buffets and all things considered this was a perfect selection.",

Our favorite was the Little station that they were serving fish tacos from. I would go to the buffet for the fish tacos alone. Desserts were also amazing, they had cute little dessert shooters. Don't bother with the Rice Krispies. They were very dry and not made with enough marshmallow. The brownie was very good and rice.  Overall, it's a pretty decent buffet if you're on a budget.",

    "text": "We have gone to the Season's Buffet at the Silverton many times simply because it was closest to where we were staying at the Oasis RV Resort. We get in and have dinner on Friday. Some nights are more than 3 stars but overall it rounds down.   They dinner on Friday is called the Harvest Buffet (?) for  $22.99 regular price and $19.99 with the casino rewards card. It's not a bad deal considering you get all you want to drink (milk, soda, coffee, tea), appetizer, soup or salad, entrees and dessert. The thing I like about a buffet is that I can try many things but the bad thing is the quality isn't high. You might find some things you really like but most is just ok.   Harvest buffet means fresh food from whatever season it is (I'm told) with different stations of Soups and Salads, Seafood Station, Carving Station and American, Italian Stations. It was regular food-nothing I could say was seasonal and the Dessert Station seems the same as always-pies, cakes, etc.   We tried the Polynesian Buffet once but it was right when they first starts it (way back) and I wasn't happy they replaced something we liked. So I don't think I gave it a fair shake-though my husband loved the pork. We will try it again after reading the reviews. I'm not sure why it's more expensive  but it's $23.99 regular price and $21.99 with the rewards card.   Sunday from 10am - 3pm they have a Bellini Brunch which is a nice treat for breakfast out. They have the regular breakfast foods with some that are a bit more special. Just the Bellini cocktails make the meal. It was  $19.99 regular price and $17.99 with the rewards card.  Seafood Night is Thursday (which is odd since I always expect it on a Friday).  It seemed high for what we got at  $32.99 regular price and $30.99 with the rewards card. The seafood was pretty generic and nothing special for a Las Vegas buffet.   We have gone on Mondays for the 50+ Buffet Day since we are over 50 and get 50% off a Buffet all day. The small print is is not just for your age. You must have Gold, Platinum or Diamond Silverton Rewards Club card which means playing a lot. Then you have to get a printed coupon from their machine and show a valid photo ID. I don't play that much. My husband qualified for the Golf so he would get half off and mine would be full price. The meal was good for half off but not so great at full price.   We were a bit disappointed with the buffet. Casinos used to bring you in by offering good buffers at a reasonable or cheap price. Now, the price on some nights is high enough so I expect more.  Considering you get a full meal, it's pretty good.",

    "text": "After a whole slew of problems getting a  hold of someone at Silverton who would book my reservation for my rehearsal night dinner for my wedding at the buffet, I finally did actually book the reservation. I even gave my credit card number to hold the reservation as the guest list for my party was 25 people.  We arrive at Seasons on the night of my rehearsal dinner and the incompetent girls at the register know nothing of my reservation. In fact, they point out to me, \"We don't take reservations\". As I slid into a monumental ball of anger and lost it, yes I really did, lose it on this girl, she finally got the idea I was not joking and got her \"manager\". Ah yes, to no surprise, and to my chagrin - who was the manager? The woman I booked the reservation through! Since I was about to start peppering this woman with the worst curse words I could think of, my mother and father stepped in and spoke with her. Oh, well our reservation had gotten \"lost in the scuffle\" of Silverton changing over management styles and who takes reservations for what. WELL THEN - where is my credit card information!? I'd like to know that.  Then the lady says, don't worry we are setting up the table now. Okay. What if there had not been enough room in the buffet to seat our 25 person table, what then? As the lady keep apologizing and we march into the buffet with little servers still scurrying around trying to set up our non-existent reservation I am still hopping mad.  The food is mediocre. There's a pasta bar - woo hoo. There's hardly any selection of varying ethnic cuisines. The only decent section is the dessert bar. On our night there they were making excellent bananas foster.   They didn't comp us. They only apologized after my father insisted they apologize to us for losing our reservation. They still charged us for drinks even though they ROYALLY FUCKED UP.  Never again. And I suggest no one ever eat here and definitely don't even attempt to make a reservation ANYWHERE at Silverton - they'll lose it - and your CREDIT CARD NUMBER TOO!",

Excellent - Kalula pig and kalbi Beef (so tender, juicy and delish!), Cheese Ravoli  Good - Chicken Noodle Soup,  Ok - Poki, Tomato Bisque, Japanese Salad, Mint Chicken wings  Meh - Dumpling soup - the dumplings were too doughy and not much filling.  Icky -Flower Egg Drop Soup, Luau pig was too dry and the skin was NOT edible.",

Went here with my husband, it was $19/person with a members card. Service was good and attentive. The asian guy as our bus person and the ladies at the cashiers were friendly. No line on a Friday night around 7! We had a good experience but disappointed in the limited amount of food. They had a German section, seafood, salad, Italian, asian, and dessert. They all contained about 6 dishes. We didn't even try the salad because it looked..well plain. The watermelon was sweet though! The Italian section was probably the richest flavored. Had pasta, pizza, other stuff I don't recall.  The asian was nothing extraordinary. Singapore noodles were probably the best in my opinion. Egg drop soup was good.  I didn't try much of the German food, but my husband did. He is German himself and he didn't want me to try some of the things because he said it'll give me a bad rep of the food lol.  They had good sir loin however. Went back for seconds.  Seafood was mostly fried stuff (cod, oyster, clam, shrimp). 3/5 for those. They also had cocktail shrimp (nothing special, was low the whole night) and cedar plank salmon(not too big of a fan).  The dessert had the biggest variety but nothing that appealing. Chocolate strawberries were good. Only three ice cream flavors (Neapolitan).",

The whole staff from the cashier girls to the servers and the manager were so so nice. Please bring some tip money to tip your bar Bellini tender especially Anne she was the nicest person ever and she makes the best drinks. If you have a rewards card up to four people gets to eat for $17.99 unlimited Bellini or soft drinks included. Of not it only $19.99 and for that price food was not bad at all. Not gourmet food but good food for a buffet. Also the atmosphere was really nice and the Resturant was clean. Beautiful decor and comfortable seating in a large space. It was totally worth it and on Saturday nights they have the same deal for a Polynesian dinner. That I will come back to try. For a local spot it is a good deal!",

There was nothing remarkable about the food. I ate some mediocre dishes that seemed to largely come from frozen. Nothing was horrible, but we will not be going back.  On a friday night, there was no prime rib, no seafood, nothing at all special.  And at $17 per person, I really wish I would have taken a few moments to read reviews before we'd gone in.  I could have had a much better dinner for the same dollar hundreds of other places in the city, literally.  And in the future, I will be doing so.",

With that in mind, yes it was totally worth it. Actually even for the $14 full price it was an ok deal since it includes soft drinks, dinner and dessert.   I cant think of even one thing that stood out as good - everything we tried was pretty mediocre, bordering on bad. Even the ice cream doesn't look like real ice cream anymore - they seem to have switched to dairy dessert stuff. For people that work in casinos - it's about the same quality level as employee dining (that isn't a good thing)  You're better off paying twice the amount for a better quality buffet on the strip. For reference, the Main Street buffet is much better than this.",

As far as local casinos go, I'd say it's above average. Definitely better than the coast and most station buffets.   Last time I went was on Friday for their seafood buffet. I ate crab legs, peel and eat shrimp, oysters rockefeller and a decent paella. The crab legs were a little overcooked and hard to crack. They are precut which is supposed to make them easier to crack but the shell was a bit rubbery so they were kind of pain to deal with. When I did get to the meat it was not overly salty which I really like. Lots of buffet crab legs (and buffet food in general) is too salty for my taste.  This Silverton runs some good promotions periodically and Friday night we bought 2 buffets for the price of 1. It was $25 before tip. We arrived around 6:30ish and there was no waiting but there was a decent line when we were leaving. The service was pretty standard. Our waiter brought us drinks, extra napkins and cleared our plates. Which is important to me. When I am finished eating I want my plate out of my face, now. (Always in a nice way though ;)",

They don't have chairs that make you feel rushed. Now on to the food. Where to start. Hmm with the salads it's a nice spread. Even tuna poke salad. And the fruits like watermelon were juicy and sweet. From the lau lau to the roasted pig delicious. They never let the side dishes empty out. It would be nice if they had a ice cream machine so I could make my own sundaes. And the ice cream Batista didn't have any bowls either. Guess ill grab a soup bowl next time and bring it over. All in all a pleasant delicious experience. And after 4pm its 5 dollars all you cab drink beer in the buffet.  The server never let my drinks go unattended which is a huge plus for me",

The line wasn't terribly long, but it was rather slow. Just doesn't seem too efficient so I am sure $5 days must be ridiculous.   Bellinis come in 5 flavors and I tried the raspberry and the passionfruit (they also had a pomegranate, orange, and pineapple I believe) which was decent, but I just didn't feel like having a drunk morning and getting all of the flavors.   They have a basic salad station, breakfast food station (with a omelette station), chinese food area, American (with lamb and steamship beef roast carving), Italian station , seafood area (with steamed crab) and dessert (with ice cream station).   I didn't try the steamed crab because it was a long line and I wasn't in the mood but the lamb and beef was okay. The surprising standout was salmon that was slightly smoked and served with a creamy dill sauce which was juicy and flavorful.   Desserts were pretty meh. I took bites of cakes that werent very good and finally satisfied my sweet tooth more with the cheese blintz from the breakfast area which was good and a scoop of ice cream.  Service was pretty decent. The plates were cleared pretty fast and drinks refilled.   Overall, it was a OK buffet. Nothing too terrible, but nothing standout. If you aren't here to get drunk or eat so much crab legs you give yourself a allergy then it might not be worth it, but I guess for some $20 isn't bad either. I think I rather spend a little bit more to get a higher quality/ taste ratio to the price.",

Maybe they could have had this group segregated in a certain section of the restaurant to avoid disturbing the rest of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Well I've been here several times now for the Polynesian night  and I have to say that the food is good for the price. That being said, I only go when I have the two free buffets  promotion (with the Silverton Rewards Club  Card) and with only two people... so yeah, it's really worth it. A lot of items are hit or miss but overall I can't complain and it has actually gotten better each time I go. There usually  isn't much of a wait and the food is always hot and generally fresh.  If you haven't tried it in a while, wait for the promotion and try it again after all free food is better than.. well okay.. it's free food, deal with it.  For the rest of the review, keep in mind that we brought two teens with us that took our price from free to just over $40 before tip. Also, this review is ONLY for the Polynesian night.  Now, for what's good. Their tuna poke seems to occupy a considerable portion of my plate each time. The giant roasted pig freaked the kids out but whatever, they think McDonalds rules the world so they don't count. The roasted pig is very good every time I have it. There was also some salt and pepper pork that seriously made an impression on everyone at the table including the grumpy, texting teens. There were a couple of soups that were really good especially the one over by the sushi that had the clear noodles. I don't remember the name but it looked so nasty that I just had to try it and to my surprise it was actually very good. The Wonton soup was very good as well. The mashed potatoes and bowtie pasta were great. I even had a couple pieces of a spicy tuna roll that didn't offend me as sushi on a buffet can often do.  Also, the peel  and eat shrimp was good but naturally should have been fail proof one would think.  The oysters are usually decent enough except for the fact that they ran out of them by 4:45pm. We arrived at 4:30pm and they open at 4pm and I didn't even get one. Not cool. I stood there and watched as the guy in front of me filled up two plates until there were none left. I was impressed with his lack of consideration for the line of  people behind him and yet jealous at the same time.  The empty space was replaced with clams that had something on them that I wasn't all that impressed with.  The clams were fresh but the topping just ruined it for me, not my thing I guess.   Some misses were believe it or not the macaroni and cheese. Bad enough to spit out. Same  goes for the macaroni  salad and popcorn shrimp. Just bad. Like take it off the buffet entirely kinda bad. No really. Now for the prime rib. Usually it is pretty good. This last time was different. It was cooked entirely rare and if anyone wanted it cooked differently it was sliced and put on a grill to be cooked to their liking. As I watched cooked slices being handed off to other customers it looked like nothing more than a bad steak. I opted for mine rare as I generally like it. Unfortunately I couldn't even eat that. I felt really bad having to leave an excellent  cut of meat on my plate. It just felt wrong.  Overall, the food (on Polynesian night)was good enough to go back, when it's free (or BOGO), if you don't bring teens, just happen to be in the area and are in general just really hungry enough to not care. You just need to find what you like and stick with that. Unfortunately this isn't the type of buffet where you walk in and love every single item that they have. I give it three stars only because I know that what is good is really good and that comprises more than half of the buffet. As for the rest of the buffet,  it may be a bit blah but a person can only eat so much anyway. I just go back to the good stuff and that works for me. If I had to pay the regular price of $21.99 I probably wouldn't go. That being said, I have no doubt that I will be returning when my next promotion comes in the mail.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Bellini Brunch - This review will be just on the bellini brunch. I've tried their lunch and dinner, but I much prefer the brunch.        - Crab Legs - They steam up hot crab legs and give them out by the plateful. This makes the Brunch worth it already. There are a couple different dipping sauces (I like Cajun Spices) to choose from (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw?select=5VpD4EFcZid5P_yFHV4SQg#5VpD4EFcZid5P_yFHV4SQg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/h_g5...</a>).        - Champagne - There's a champagne station to grab your mimosas and other brunch drinks.        - Brunch - They have all the regular brunch things like an omelette station, bacon, sausage, country friend ham, eggs benny, waffles, etc.        - Clams - They have steamed clams that are pretty good.        - Cutting Station - They used to have prime rib which was really good, but now they only have roast beef, ham, and lamb.        - Dessert - They have the normal desserts you'd see at a buffet (pies, ice cream, pastries). The two things that they have that others don't are donuts and a chocolate fountain.        - Overall - I come back for the crab legs, clams, and generic brunch items. If you don't like crab legs or clams, there's probably no point in coming here. There are a lot of other brunch buffets with better items. **Price**        - $17.99 with Rewards card - Bellini Brunch - Sundays 9am - 3pm. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend the Sunday brunch if you like hot crab legs.",

After waiting 2 hours, I went to check to see how much longer, they said another 90 mins to 2 hours.  What???!!! Then I ask them, how people does the restaurant seat?  The restaurant holds 200 people at a time and VIP Plantinum members only need to wait 30 minutes to be seated.  So if you are not a high roller or you're not there at 3:30 Pm forget eating there.  I left there after being on the airing list for 2 hours.",

They also have other restaurants inside the casino if you're not interested in the buffet. Peel and eat shrimp, $8 \"bottomless\" liquor (beer or wine) is definitely a must if you have extra cash on you.",

    "text": "Lobster Feast Fridays 4-9pm $37.99 ($35.99 with rewards card) My boyfriend signed up for the rewards card right before we went to eat and received a 50% off dining coupon. So we paid $38 for both of us before gratuity. It also includes bottomless wine and Miller Lite.  We came around 8pm and there was only a few people in line. The line moved quickly, from the moment we got in line to the moment we were seated was about 15 minutes.   The service was good. Anne was great. Our plates were cleared quickly, we never had more than 2 plates stacked at any time. She also made sure our drinks were filled.  The selection isn't the greatest so I would only recommend you do it if you like LOBSTER.  They had the typical basic salads, clam chowder, chicken noodle soup, charbroiled oysters, lobster claws, chilled shrimp, chilled raw oysters, pizza, assorted sushi, potstickers, lobster mac and cheese, NY strip, mussels, clams,  grilled lobster tails, crab cake stuffed lobster tail, and a few other dishes.  I tried the lobster claws, raw oysters, charbroiled oysters, potstickers, NY strip, mussels, clams, lobster tails, chocolate cake, and coconut cake. The only thing I would come back for is the lobster tails.  The lobster tails are served by an employee and you are allowed 2 tails per person each time, you can choose whether you would like it dipped in butter or not. Joe, the gentleman serving us was great! He was very nice. Since they serve you the lobster and each person can get 2 at a time, it makes the process quick and there was no more than 5 people in line at one time. We also never had to wait for them to refill it.   All in all, I would come back for the lobster. I had 13 lobsters and my boyfriend had 7 so it was definitely worth it for us.",

This is definitely going to be a go to for us.   We got the buffet for lunch for 2 adults, 2 teenagers and a 7 year old with bottomless beer for my husband for $38.40. Seriously?! I worried it was too good to be True and the food would be so so. Wow was I wrong!  The food is served in smaller serving dishes on the buffet line but that means they're making more food FRESH more OFTEN! Everything was delicious and between the five of us we literally tried almost everything.   Variety- plenty of options: healthy, American, Asian, BBQ, vegetarian/vegan and PLENTY of desserts and ice cream!   Bathrooms - located super close in casino and very clean.   Staff - PLEASANT, POLITE and happy! So many places the staff seems miserable, but not here. Our server was a wonderful woman and several others came to constantly clear the dishes from the table.   Cleanliness - the food line, dishes, tables and atmosphere was very clean and well kept!   We will, as I already stated, absolutely be back.   You should go, try it at least once. You can gamble or check out the free aquarium, which also features mermaids Thursday's - Sunday's.",

The phrase you get what you pay for is a harsh reality $11.90 (adult) to avoid a fast food chain is a valid comparison. There is minimal fruit & I mean 1 bowl for an entire restaurant with mixed pineapple, grapes, melons & cantaloupe (I can't eat the last 2), not much of a salad bar either & their popular fish tacos have minimal fish & tons of fried batter & oily toppings. Desserts were hard &/or dry; strawberry ice cream had an awkward taste, like lots of sugar substitutes. The guacamole left such a bad aftertaste I spit out my coffee which was already not good, but forced me to reset my tastebuds with literally sugar power.  Our server gave us attitude with our drink order, 3 waters, 2 coffees & 1 sprite, I have no idea why she would tilt her head back, roll her eyes & say \"you're killing me smalls\" just bc my brother asked for a type of tea they didn't have. FYI they only have Black tea. I didn't get her name but it was around 1pm. Was there anything I liked? The carving station's brisket, the horseradish, mashed potatoes & miniature eclair. I wholeheartedly wish I could say I'll never return, BUT, I do want to try the Saturday Polynesian buffet which is what put this place on the map for me to begin with. Wish me luck!",

The Buffet was nice good amount of seating and a good amount of food stations. It's your typical buffet with breakfast and some lunch/dinner items. Since it was a Sunday it was their brunch menu. The selection was average some of the seafood items didn't look appetizing enough. The breakfast items were ok but you know when bread stuff is left out for a while it's gets a little hard like the French toast. I was hoping for some pancakes but they didn't have any they had waffles which were ok. The highlight for me was the eggs I was able to get freshly done over easy and the ice cream. Overall for half price it was average I probably wouldn't pay normal price since there are better ones but if you happen. To be stuck here well there are lots of choices.

Slim choices at all stations nothing looked appealing and if I thought there might be something to eat like the turkey it was dry over salted veggies over salted most choices had been sitting looked old even the desert bar wasn't at all appetizing- service was slim. My guests were also disgusted please before you spend $17 dollars or even $10 go somewhere else this place was by far the worst!",

    "text": "This a fine example of quantity over quality. Friday night deal for 37.99 lobster buffet sounds like a great deal, which it is however you get what you pay for.  First off, the entire building of Silverton has this weird musty smell / odor which either comes from the AC or the carpets or whatever. either way, it smells pretty bad, nauseating and disgusting which messes with your appetite to eat.  On to the Buffet, Friday night, arrived 3:45pm (they open at 4) and the line was ridiculously long. My party of 2 was not seated till 7pm making this a 3hour wait in this awful smelling casino.  Our server was great, no complaints on service, however the food served there is a big hit or miss. The seafood served there had a unique / different texture. The lobster tails was dry and tough, the lobster claws were also dry and tough. But what disgusted me the most was the oysters. They were absolutely disgusting, nearly vomited. No where tasted fresh or safe to eat. They had this really bad texture and after taste, I immediately spat it right out. This along with the weird after taste and texture of their lobster leaves me wondering the quality of their seafood. Though it was a good price, I would not be returning here for this nor do I recommend any of my friends to try this as well. 3 hours wait, $90 later (2 guest) and I immediate regret eating here, while I was walking out suffocating and trying not to throw up.  Good luck to everyone looking to beat the lobster system.",

We went straight to the lobster isle to taste their over cooked dried lobsters, they dunk all their lobsters in the butter pot I guess to make it not taste dry. I opted out of that because I did not want any more unnecessary cholesterol. We forced ourself to chug down the lobsters and that was pretty much what we ate. Everything else was not appetizing. It's no way near comparable to San Manuel Casino in California. The quality does suck and they don't got green tea which was another downer.  Been there done that and won't be back.",

I was so suprised especially in Vegas. The food was not fresh, the food area was dirty, and not a lot of options. Honestly we couldn't pick anything we like from there. We had our two teenager kids with us and they thought it was bad. Even the deserts. I thought teenagers eat anything surprisingly no. The only thing that I got them to eat was two bites of the pasta.  It was a waste of money! when we left I had to take them to Steak and Shake. Never again will we ever go there.   Oh what happened to the seafood? crab legs, oysters or even sushi! It did not exist!  Carving Station was horrible the meat look so dry. The Prime ribs seems like its been sitting there for along time. I like my prime ribs medium rare, I honestly don't think they know what that means because their Prime ribs is overcooked.  The employees that work at the buffet section need a class/ training on customer service because they're so rude especially the pasta lady.",

    "text": "That's it. I'm through with giving these guys an annual second chance. Even with a coupon, it's not worth it.  I used to be quite fond of Seasons for everything but brunch, which was - at least at the time - a little too-seafoody and not-breakfasty enough for me. (Keeping in mind that I'm a vegetarian.) We all have our preferences. Unfortunately, Seasons can no longer even meet my basic \"preferences\" for \"tasty food,\" let alone variety or service.  Service was pretty awful. We eventually had one plate cleared, but no refills and no eye contact. Hey, kind of like the last few times. (Excepting that one time when we didn't get any drink at all.)  The food for me ranged from \"inoffensive but I can do better at home\" to \"Wow. Gross.\"  Here, let me show you a photo of \"Wow. Gross.\": <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw?select=JphnoRRzPvpz3CKnTWaHnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/h_g5...</a>  Even before the discovery of hair in my scrambled eggs, they were pretty unimpressive, coming from the culinary tradition of \"let's mindlessly let some eggs bake on the skillet, then chop them up with a spatula and call it 'scrambled.'\"  The waffle was inoffensive. No fruit or cream, though, and you'll have to fight the omelette station patrons to get near the maple syrup. Don't forget to hit the salad bar for butter. It's next to the cream cheese, which would suggest bagels, but instead the only bread you'll find there is dinner rolls  Most of the breakfast buffet, other than single tight wedge of eggs, potatoes (bland), and waffle squares, is Asian fare and lunch-suitable items. My one vegetarian choice was some macaroni and cheese of a neon orange hue, right down to the squirts of oil that came out of every bite. Ick.  Dessert selection was less remarkable than I remembered. A sort of croquembouche is on display, but nothing that elegant is actually available. Flan, cookies, carrot cake. I remember that on previous trips, those made since Seasons turned on me, usually resulted in a \"decent but unremarkable\" dessert buffet experience for lack of other options, but this time I just wanted to get out. I did make myself a salad, and that was fine, but couldn't stand on its own as a reason to dip into the dining budget. (Keep in mind that, with 2-for-1 coupon, my meal was only $5.40.)  Unless you are a captive tourist with a coupon, you can do better at so many other places. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to tell you where you can do worse.",

The atmosphere is excellent with beautiful high end decor with elements of fire, water, earth, and nature abound.   The booths are super large and comfortable.    You feel good eating here.

AYCE comes with soda refills.  - Come around 6-7pm, You'll be in line for a while.  - I've eaten here a few times before, and their players card is pretty lenient with giving half-priced buffets. After a few rounds at the tables, I usually get a free buffet, or sometimes BOGO. They have a BOGO on the Casino Guide too.  - In retrospect, I should have just used the BOGO for their new and improved Polynesian buffet, Saturdays from 4-9pm. The list looked great! All the favorites, including poke. Definitely going to come back for that!  - Anyway, I usually get their chicken noodle soup and the salad. Better than Sweet Tomatoes in terms of soup. Their chicken noodle broth and chicken are great. Noodles are actually macaroni. Haha. Their salads have baby corn. That a premium veggie at ST. haha.  - I don't get the Asian food much, since it takes worse than a cheap Chinese buffet, but I haven't had it in a while, so I decided to delve into it. The Sinapore noodles were like a spicy pancit, which I liked. Get the Wanton soup and Lemon chicken.  - They have a chef making pasta for you, but I passed this time around. Typically, it's a bit too wet for my liking. Drenched with sauce.  - Get the mussels, clams and shrimp. Goes out fast.  - Service was quick.  - Feast buffet has more of a Variety. But for about $8 a person, with a coupon, It's a good deal when you got it!",

Bummer!!  But because the group was already set up in a back area (where, unlike the rest of the restaurant, was WAY too bright), we were able to dodge the line that snaked almost to the door, like Disney World.  That was almost worth paying full price.  The additional down side, though, was that an 18% tip was added on.  Who the hell tips 18% at a buffet????  I was pleasantly surprised to see so much seafood - shrimp in various disguises, king crab legs, baby mussels, oysters Rockefeller, seafood paella, and then it hit me - Duh!  Friday night is Surf & Turf night here.  Mostly everything was well-presented and pretty good.  Nothing was dried out from sitting too long, and one salmon dish - a whole side of salmon over a tomato and onion melange - was particularly delicious.  The steaks were tender and juicy.  Wine was $5 for as much as you wanted.  All in all, I'd go back again, but I'd make sure to go on a night when I can use a coupon!",

I tried food ranging from the shoe leather turkey to the eight year old sweet and sour pork and each trip was worse the the other. Even the deserts were tasteless. I tried the pumpkin pie and the carrot cake. It's a sad day when there is no difference between the two.  Our waiter came by three times to check on us, each time asking if I would like a refill on my iced tea. I said yes please three times and yet never had it refilled even once.

The staff were not very accommodating to the \"regular\" folks that already paid while still waiting online for seats, the staff were instead saving a large sections of the tables for VIPs members (who I might add wasn't even there at all)  Got in, started looking around and found that it didn't offer a lot.  Pig was served (always get the skin), poke tasted a bit bland, the chicken wing in sauce was probably the best item there.   Everything else was mainly vegetables and offers very little of other cuisine. The dessert was the worst display ever-- very little offering, disgusting stale looking desserts, and ice cream suck big time.  Not worth my time.",

She serves a huge dish of delicious new improved Ice Cream. They now serve caramel syrup adding more pluses to the A grade. All the Desert Staff are fantastic but Shawn is my favorite. Ask for her when you partake in their Ice Cream. Management, please acknowledge Shawn for my wife and myself?",

    "text": "Very disappointed in the turn this buffet has taken.  I've eaten there probably 50+ times (four times in the last two weeks) and in the last few months it has just become OK as opposed to a place I'd want to eat.    My biggest disappointment is that they have removed the beef brisket from the line up.  It was always my favorite and one of the most flavorful tender briskets I've had.  That was the main draw for me, as with many of my friends.    Now I've been told by Silverton that they have brisket every day.  I'm not sure what they think brisket is, but what they are serving is roast beef.  I'm from the South and I know my brisket.  What they are trying to pass off as brisket is actually a cut of meat from hind quarters of the cow as opposed to a flat cut from the breast section.  Brisket can be flaked apart with a fork, as opposed to having to be cut with a knife the way the roast beef they are serving has to be.    Also, it used to be a much wider variety of food on various days, now it is the same thing every day!  The only thing that seems to change up is the Asian section.    I asked to talk to a manager tonight, right after we arrived.  I explained how much I loved their brisket and asked when and if if would ever be back.  She said she would talk to the Chef and let me know what she found out.  She never came back.    I was recently traveling for 10 weeks, so I wasn't in during that time, but if I recall correctly, things started changing before I left.  I was told that they had a new chef, and I'm not sure I'm pleased with some of the changes.  It was perfect before, why change what isn't broken.  I sure hope I don't have to take Seasons Buffet off my recommended list.",

    "text": "go if you have a 2-4-1 or 50% off coupon $11.  went on luau day today. and it was just..\"meh.\"    After only 45 mins after opening, they ran out of the good sashimi (eel, tuna, shrimp, salmon) and just had \"ok\" rolls and a whitefish, not sure what it was.   The pickled ginger was the peak of the sushi menu - chilled, and plenty of it.  (Sarcam if you can't read it..)     So, then I tried the pork.  The crispy skin (best part) was all gone, but the pork was tender.   The poi (gotta ask for it) - and yes I asked for some - was a bit sweet for me.    Lessee...the favorite luau food was the chili-lime chicken, because it was crispy!  The huli-huli chicken was ok, but a bit dry, so make sure you get plenty of sauce on the bottom of the pan.    I passed on the prime rib- was overdone when I saw it two times.  Then the third pass on the way to the dessert bar, I looked good, but I was full.  the chocolate cake with mint ice cream was good -but average.  No gelato.  I looked for some fresh cut fruit, but it was canned, so passed on it.    In conclusion: next time, and only with the $11 price tag, I'll try the beef, lau lau (hidden away), som-moah chili lime chicken wings, and eat the non-sushi items.    Peel and eat shrimp is available, plenty of good choices with dessert and non-sugar added options, but try it once, and try something else.     50+ members have 1/2 off mondays with players club card.",

On this occasion I had friends in from out of town who were in desperate need of AYCE food. I suggested Seasons and off we went. We got in line (which was scarily long) and started to wait. We heard rumblings of a free buffet offer and took turns to go to the Rewards Club  booth to sign up. My fella and I already had cards, but we got free buffets and $5 in slot play for signing up newbies, score!  It took us an hour and a half to get through the line and everyone was getting pretty antsy in line. My friends had a show to get to, so each passing minute was making them nervous about leaving on time. We finally got seated and off they went to scrounge around for a plate of food before they had to run off. The food is always pretty solid for buffet food but I had to deduct a star for slow service and the long line. They did deal with it the best they could as the servers and the rest of the staff were obviously overwhelmed with large amount of people filtering in and out because of the promotion. They definitely need to account for this and staff more people on the weekends.  All in all, a solid buffet that I usually suggest to friends and family when they're looking for good food on the cheap. Bets of all, they have chocolate covered strawberries. I know, the simple pleasures.",

    "text": "I've been going to this casino and it's buffet for years. It's always good, not expensive, and great service. In Vegas, that works. This summer, they took a step above the non strip buffets. They added the Friday evening Lobster buffet....this is music to my ears. Grew up loving lobster and was able to eat it often because we grew up on the Northeast coast. If we wanted a few lobsters for dinner, we'd go to the docks and buy them from the fisherman coming in from checking there daily pot. Not by the pound, we always bought it by the lobster. So, it was great. After moving out here, it's still easy to get lobster, just not as cheap, and not as <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffresh.So&s=1e6b0352f9f6d2876a98544704e36bb66f6c4f4d0cafa9ddcd01e7e2419ba2ea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fresh.So</a>, after hearing about this buffet, needless to say I was happy.  The price is fair, with casino card, it's $37.99, without the card, $39.99. Still a very solid price. It's $15 cheaper than any other buffet that offers lobster at its buffet, and those are \"holiday\" prices. So it's nice to have a non strip buffet offering lobster.  The buffet menu is very solid. It's a lobster theme, the main lobster offered is as follows, they offer lobster tail, about 4oz each, the first time they seemed bigger, time #2, they were mostly 3-4oz, and at that station, they offer 2 types, steamed tails w/butter, or baked stuffed tails also w/butter. It's controlled by worker and they give you 2 tails at a time. Line sometimes looks long, but it's no longer than 5-6 minutes, at the most!!! At the start of the buffet area, near the salad bar, they offer a raw bar of lobster claws, oysters, shrimp, and cherry stones. All ice cold and full. More \"lobster\" items are Lobster MAC & Cheese, another lobster and cream sauce dish, they also have a lobster taco station. Honestly, I'm in it for the steamed & stuffed tails. By far the best offer in the city. I've been to the Sterling Brunch for $125 per head, yes, the tails are bigger, and the offering are more expensive, but $125? Never again. The M Resorts offers a \"holiday\" buffet around Christmas & New Years, it's $55 per, and the buffet is great, the lobster was a burn job, tails cut in half, 1 per plate!!!! That a rip off. You won't need to worry about that here, you can get plenty here. And they all were the same. No difference in taste or cooking with each try coming out from the kitchen. Just a great job with this buffet. They also offer chicken, beef, and the other normal buffet dishes. This is the best lobster offering in the city, by far. Check it out, it's worth it.   The only thing that stinks is the wait time. Get ready to wait an hour. So what we did is took turns waiting. We each waited 30 minutes while the others gambled. It's worked out great, just let the people know behind you that you have a couple others with me, there just sitting down. That way you get no dirty looks, or people getting upset because you held the line for others. I always tell people in line behind me that I have others with me just to make things smooth. In today's world I try to always be nice.  Anyway, check this out if you love lobster, you won't be disappointed. And I also noticed instead of 4 pm opening, they moved it up to 3pm opening. It works out great for me, I'd much rather eat early. The earlier, the better.",

    "text": "= Location: The Season Buffet is located in the Silverton Casino and Hotel. It's on the corner of Blue Diamond Road and the freeway 15 freeway. They promote that they are a Live-Action Buffet: \"feature[ing] delicious cuisine prepared right before your eyes, so you can enjoy the freshest flavors possible.\"   = Setting/Atmosphere: I attended the dinner on Saturday night for their Polynesian Buffet. The inside of the restaurant was beautiful. In comparison to other major casino buffets, they offer limited seating.   = Service: I waited in line for a seat for an excess of 1 hour. During this time the Manager Susan was not coordinating seating appropriately. The bussers walking around excessively not cleaning up tables on a timely matter to address the high volume of guest entering the buffet. There were two people walking around setting up tables, some of them could have been cleaning up tables as well... Personally, the manager besides standing around and bossing people around to do work should have also helped with cleaning up the tables to keep up with the demand.   There was also a side of the buffet that was not being utilized, which could have been extra seating.   = Drink(s)/Food(s): They provided many amazing island food. Featured items like ahi poke, sushi, suckling pig with crispy skin, pork lau lau, lomi lomi, chicken curry and more.  The quality of the food was subpar. Although all of the food was cooked fresh, it was not seasoned appropriately and/or tasting plain.   = WiFi (For Yelpin + Insta): The casino offers free Wifi, however, access is limited in the buffet.   = Overall: I was overall not impressed with the food and the experience was horrible. I do not recommend this buffets to others. I do not plan on returning anytime soon.",

We're back to the lament at the end of the movie Casino about Vegas going down hill. If your casino charges me for parking or feeds me crappy food in the buffet, I probably won't be back much.

    "text": "Tips for Friday's Lobster Fest buffet:   1) Dinner starts at 4pm. Arrive at 2pm to be the first or one of the first in line. This should get you seated inside the restaurant before 4pm. Arriving at 3pm or later will have you waiting for 3 hours or more to be sat. The line at 4pm was INSANE.   2) If you don't have a Silverton players card, get one while your companion is waiting in line at the restaurant. They'll give you a 50% off dining coupon that can be used for you and one other person for the buffet. That's $18 per person for all you can eat lobster. Score!   3) They only allow you to get two tails at a time but lines at the actual buffet go fast. Fill up on the tails because the rest of the selection is less than mediocre. The cocktail lobster claws are either waterlogged and/or rubbery. Gross. The lobster in the made-to-order tacos are fried little chunks that are tough and don't taste like lobster. Lobster Mac and cheese was... just not good. Eat a salad and as many tails as you can.   4) Get in and get out. Be considerate to the hundreds of people waiting in line. Don't be that table digesting for 1 hour so you can gorge on one more plate or sit there socializing long after you're done. If you'd be pissed after waiting in line for 3 hours to get to the front of the line and be told \"we're just waiting for another table to get up\" and seeing a table just sitting there obviously on the verge of a food coma and no longer eating... then don't do it yourself. Golden Rule, people. That goes for regular restaurants, too. Don't sit there socializing for an hour or more after you've paid. You're screwing over the people waiting to have dinner in the lobby and you're screwing over your server who needs to pay their bills.",

As much as I want to walk away, I promised the husband that we would try it at least once. I honestly don't think I see myself coming back here ever again.   Lobster itself is not bad in fact, it's less than $40 per person so it's really on the cheap side. We went straight to the lobster section, they will give 2 tails at a time. There's 2 options,  the oven roasted lobster tails and crab cake stuffed lobster tails. I like the one first better.   The lobster legs were quite impressive! The biggest and chunkiest I've seen so far lol! It was a little bit overcooked but otherwise it was good.   The buffet spread can be better though especially the dessert section. It's just simply plain and unappetizing! They have a few pies and cakes but who knows how long it's been in the freezer.   Service was great and the staff are attentive. I would recommend coming here at least an hour prior to dinner time. Also, you might want to sign up for the players card for some discount or promotional price.",

We revived a BOGO as a gift from our timeshare resort The Grandview at Las Vegas.  It's not as huge as you would expected but it was enough for me. I have seen bigger casino buffets as well as the cruise ships buffets but I was quit pleased with this one.  The food was hot, fresh and tasty to my liking.  I highly recommend this buffet!!  We will return again on the next trip to Vegas.  This trip was \" off the strip\" trip!! I really enjoyed it",

    "text": "I love lobster! or do I just love butter? Well considering the crowd at Season's lobster feast seafood buffet night a lot of people love sea bugs.  I don't love overcooked lobster tails, because of the rapidly forming long customer line the lobster tails are stacked under the heat lamps to get them to the patrons faster-unfortunately drying them out and by the time you get them they're pretty overcooked and stiff. I got the crab cake stuffed lobster figuring that the crab cake would shield the lobster from overcooking, nope - even dryer and stiffer.  The lobster claws weren't the freshest and didn't have the sweet taste of good quality lobster. Many lower and mid priced provide drawn butter for the lobster claws which helps compensate for inconsistent seafood, no drawn butter was provided only sugary cocktail sauce. Another big problem was the shortage of seafood crackers to open the lobster claws resulted in having to wait till they were washed.  The clams in the clam bake were dry, again overcooked. The Grilled Cajun oysters were sometimes great sometimes overcooked. The key seems to get to grilled oysters and clams when they are just brought out before they spend time drying out in the tray but not possible unless you're seated with a direct view of the buffet trays.   Among the positives were the staff who were universally welcoming, efficient, and attentive. The buffet dining room is spacious, well appointed, and spotless. The desserts were excellent with outstanding pies, delicious white chocolate bread pudding and all the freshly made whipped cream a glutton like me can eat in one sitting. The lobster tacos were made to order - fresh, and flavorful. The Savory lobster Mac and cheese was another standout.   When seafood is the featured point of a buffet it should be exceptional or at least good. A steaming table would be better for the lobster tails and drawn butter that patrons could access would make the lobster claws so much better.",

It's a True bargain for the price! My favorites were the lobster tails, char su pork and lobster Mac and cheese. The crab cake stuffed lobster had amazing flavor but was sadly over cooked.  I'm a dessert fiend, so I went there too! Their sugar free carrot cake was amazing! Their cookies were chewy (yum). I also need to give a shout out for the mini eclairs and macaroons. Both were fresh and delicious!",

    "text": "Seasons Buffet was baby's first Vegas buffet! Why the three stars, you ask?   While the food had a decent selection, there was misinformation on the amount of time we had to eat since we came 30 minutes before Sunday champagne brunch ended.... the cashier told us we had 30 minutes TO GET FOOD... our server told us after we were seated/eating that we had 30 minutes TO EAT AND LEAVE so they could setup for dinner... That amount of time is barely enough for adults to eat let alone prepping food for an infant to eat too.   The variety at the buffet is pretty good and reasonably priced (even for a Sunday champagne brunch). The large dessert section is also a plus in my book!   Overall it's a good bang for your buck, but make sure you don't go towards the end of a meal. You will feel rushed like we did.",

    "text": "I have come to this buffet a couple more times since my last review about two years ago.    This buffet continues to be an excellent value off the strip.  We particularly like the Bellini Brunch on weekend mornings.  It is somewhere around $20 including the alcohol.    With that said, this time we visited on July 4th. They had a  Buy 1, Get 1 Free promotion on that day.  The buffet was reasonably priced and not increased like so many strip properties on the holiday.    With that said, this is the first time I will have to downgrade my star level to a four.  Don't get me wrong, it was still a value and a lot of the food was still really good.  The service was also great.  However, with my buffet rule of 75% of dishes to my liking for a five star review -- a lot of the food was dry and not as tasty as prior occasions to this restaurant.  I still give it an overall four; however, I hope to try it again next time for a return to a five.",

    "text": "It can be challenging being a restaurant explorer on weekdays in a city filled with resorts offering fabulous weekday lunch buffets. The Silverton Lodge Season's Buffet is the quintessence of the high quality weekday lunch buffet bargain. From 11 AM to 3 PM on weekdays, their lunch buffet costs $10.81 after the $1 Players card discount. This comes out to the same price point or even less of the higher priced burger chains including the Johnny Rockets that shares the same roof. For $10.81, a little more money than McDonald's I paid for a super meal that was a combination of lunch, dinner, and dessert. When you take into consideration that I ate this super meal hours before sleep time and that the lion's share of the plates were non beef, this was a quality and not quantity dining experience. In other words I did not pig out.    The two times that I dined here were on Tuesday, December 18 at 1:05 PM and December 26 at 11:23 AM. The fact that I returned here a week later is testimony to my application of it. I seem to share the same appreciation of many people considering that when it opened at 11 AM there was a 20 minute wait.    There was quite a lot for me to appreciate about Season's Buffet. Seven reasons were the seven stations featuring appetizing food. Here are the stations and some of the food items:  Mexican   Tacos with ingredients, Menudo, and Mexican shrimp cocktail.   American  Roasted corn, liver & onions, live meat including brisket and roasted turkey , baked beans, carrots, and tri-tip, smoked sausage, fried chicken, tator tarts, mashed potatoes, and chili.  Asian   Pork and shrimp fried rice, pad Tai, Chinese broccoli, sesame chicken, Spring rolls, chicken hot and sour soup, green beans, Chinese vegetables and egg drop soup   Italian   Pizza,chicken, sausage and peppers, dried ravioli, soup of the day and manicotti   Soup & Salad   Salad, lentil soup, chicken noodle soup, shrimp pasta salad, fruit salad, and artichoke salad.   Dessert  Assorted pies, assorted cakes, peanut butter brownies, lemon curd, peanut butter cupcakes, pistachio cupcakes,  Ice cream: chocolate mint, spumani, vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and peach.    My favorite item was the shrimp pasta salad. When it is available shrimp salad is one of my favorite buffet items. And when it is available, as one of the pictures below shows, I load up on it. My second favorite item was the immense serving of brisket from the live Station. This had quality written all over it. My secondary favorites were the hot & sour soup, Pad Tai, shrimp fried rice, Chinese vegetables, roasted corn, and fried chicken. The ice cream topped off this super meal. This is the first time I recall licking peach ice cream inside a buffet.    The ambiance added to my enjoyment of eating this food. It shares the same lodge theme as the hotel. A soft lighting and laid back environment permeates the lodge theme. This theme is ideal for relaxation.    Just like many buffets there were serving challenges. On both visits my server covered a large area. I took preemptive action ordering two sodas when she arrived at my table. To free up the servers, a self serve Freestyle Coke or Pepsi fountain would be beneficial.    After two visits, I am impressed with Season's Buffet. At $10.81 after the & $1 players card discount, their weekday lunch buffet is a great deal. It is so good that it can make it difficult to be a restaurant explorer.",

Downfall is they only sell Miller draft beer... that's it!  Fountain drinks and coffee are included in the price.  They have all you can eat Lobster on Fri for about $38 pp ... haven't tried it.",

I am referring to the lobster fri nights at the Silverton Seasons Buffett! Wait was alil long , but you give them a number and they call you back so you don't stand around too long compared to some other seafood buffets.  The lobster is pretty good size and the line for the lobster is quick.  The raw oysters and ahi poki are sweet and fresh.  The service was great! My drink was never empty and my table is always clean by the time I got back!  Let me tell you about the service! The chef, George, saw the line for the dessert was piling up and he started scooping and serving customer ice cream! He even did it with a big smile on his face! Talk about leadership by example to make sure the customers are taking care of! I will definitely be coming back and bringing people!",

Sign up for a card at the player's club and the day of the BOGO print out a coupon at the kiosk and head to the buffet. The coupon is only good for that day.  Also the same day you sign up for the player's card, play table games and earn just 50 points and you get another coupon for a free buffet to use anytime you want.  The buffet is pretty good for $9.99, then factor in the BOGO it's only $5/person. Can't beat that deal, as you can't even get full of of $5 at a fast food place.  There's Mexican food (fish tacos, menudo, pozole, or albondigas soup, ground beef tacos), carving station (roast beef, chicken or turkey, and even their skin fried, ham, grilled veggies), Italian (pizza, pasta), Asian (Pad thai or chow mein, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, Asian soups, string beans), and salad bar. Even for a picky eater, you can make yourself a nice big healthy salad and it will be worth the $5.",

    "text": "So first I'd like to start out by saying that we got a free voucher for one person to get in to the buffet because of how much we gambled, we so decided one night to go with no dinner plans. We didn't know the buffet schedule and just happened to show up on a Thursday night which was a seafood night, we thought we were in for a treat. Of course I had to pay to get in because my boyfriend was the one with the free voucher. $30.99. Considering it was seafood night that's pretty decently priced I thought. However when we got in there and looked at the selection, we couldn't believe how SMALL the buffet is. And how SMALL the crab legs were. We grabbed our first (and only round) of food and sat down. I realized I hadn't seen anything to cut the crab legs with and asked my server, who pointed me back the crab legs. I went back, seen nothing, and asked one of the cooks where I could find one. He said my server would bring me one. Great. I told him I was pointed here and he went and got me one. Again, small crab legs, the steak was fatty and over cooked, corn was soggy, just about the only thing we liked was the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. And other than these items they had pizza, chicken, and fries. What a selection! Also, the desert looked like it had been sitting out for hours and tasted like it too. One thing that really got me down was they didn't have those ice cream machines that typical buffets do. Their selection was awful and basically so was the food. I've never been to a buffet and gotten one plate of food for both dinner and dessert and been so disappointed. Never again.",

Aside from that - the fare was slightly less varied but of good quality and presentation.  But let's not be fooled into thinking it is spectacular.  I gave 3 stars for being a good deal - and good grub!  Realy it is A-OK!",

Salad bar was the best part. Spinach and strawberry salad was the highlight. Desert ok. Most signs did not match food.  For example: The \"fried chicken\" was roasted and dried out. Fried pot stickers were steamed.   Drinks were so slow. I had two cokes. I was by myself. And it took 15+ minutes for my first one. I already had eaten most of my salad before it came.   Very minimal offerings. Pasta bar (dry dry dry). What I assume was supposed to be Asian bar. Had lemon chicken, spring roll, dry noodle, etc. Prime rib was tough.   Just not impressed. Small and dinky. Blah service. Dry food. I went on Friday August 22, 2014.",

But our review has gone downhill since then; I believe our visits since have been on Sunday nights.  The Stations are hands-down much much better.  Because the Stations get so many more people, they have much more of a selection and the food is much fresher and of better quality.  Everything was just okay with some things better and some worse.  The chicken noodle soup was good, and nice and hot, not always the case with buffets.  Salad toppings very minimal.  The grilled veggies were very good; my husband was very disappointed with the pizza which looked good, but the crust which looked pretty thin, was not crunchy.  The supposed 'rice pilaf' had no pilaf, just dried rice and some awful spice.  Went back up and took a stuffed cabbage figuring I couldn't go wrong; tasted like it was covered in ketchup.  Desserts very so-so.  Rice crispy treat had no flavor--how do you mess that up.  Soda completely flat; couldn't tell if it was pepsi or coke; maybe it was neither.  They don't use the paper placemats which I actually like because I know it is pretty clean.  Only give you one fork.  Service is good.  Overall disappointed.",

Foods are mainstream items and are presented in a visually-appealing manner. There were Mexican specialty foods. Variety of selections for lunch is average. All foods I tasted were very good. Service was very good. The buffet was somewhat quiet and filled with many senior customers. My server said the lunch menu varies during the week. The room looks completely filled at dinner and weekend brunches. The specialty dinner nights especially have a full house and long entrance lines. While this buffet may not have the size or grandeur of the larger strip buffets, the quality of the surroundings, competence of the operation, prices, and good food make it an excellent value.",

Every minute or so another senior folk with a VIP card would come in and she would take them before taking us. After an hour it was finally our turn, the clerk asked us how many people were in our party and proceeded to ask us if we had a players card and if we wanted to sign up for one...then started making small talk. REALLY?! If I wanted a player's card, I would have waited in the player's card line. I was so irritated because she was taking her sweet time. Don't mess with hungry folks. As soon as we passed the cashier, it was all smooth sailing. The food is not bad and neither is the service once you're in. The place itself is gorgeous. But as I looked around, I was so mad at the cashier because there were so many empty tables, and SHE was the bottleneck.",

Sign up for their players club and receive a free buffet but expect the buffet line to be long and I mean long. Yes it took us almost an hour to get through the line and they without a doubt were understaffed. I was worried that my food partner was going to pass out due to low blood sugar. Finally we were seated and rushed to the buffet line. Overall I must say that this buffet wasn't too shabby. Most of their food was actually pretty good. The prime was was great for being buffet prime rib. This sucker was huge, I didn't know the actual prime rib could come in dinosaur size! The desserts were ok, by the time I actually got to dessert they were already cleaning up the stations. Overall for a buffet, this is a pretty decent buffet. They could staff it better especially since they give away free buffets. Try it for yourself when you can't decide on what to eat!",

So here we go...here are the reasons why the Seasons Buffet is awesome on a Sunday: 1. Hardly a line....everyone is at the strip which is so not the place to be, and look at me and my girls....3 people ahead of us...we are so close to crabs it's not even funny and I'm not just saying that because we are leaving Vegas. 2. Large round tables! Yes! I hate having to sit at square tables where you can't hear what is going on at the end and you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the ketchup. These tables are huge and me and my girls can get to business which involves sharing photos, memories and mimosas. 3. CRAB! What the hell happened on the strip? I went to the buffet at the Bellagio for Sunday brunch and there was no crab! Are you joking? Whatev...we are at the Silverton, so pile it on.  4. No rush! The friendly servers at the Silverton want you to sit down and stay awhile. No one pushing you out or frowning when you take obnoxious group photos. 5. When you are done eating you are steps away from the BASS PRO SHOP! Hello? Are we out of mace? It is a long trip home....we may need to check out the tents in case we get stuck somewhere....wait...are those stuffed wildlife? Who doesn't love stuffed wildlife? And the Gun selection! Wow! Well, you can definitely spend hours in the Bass Pro Shop that's for sure. Last time we left I ended up with a bottle of water, a pack of red vines and a giant stuffed Jackalope that we fondly named \"J-Lope\" and yes, she was so big she needed a seat belt. LOVE IT!",

Here you go:   Waffles not good.  No butter or whipped cream or fresh strawberry to go on waffles.  Only cheap nasty strawberry giz goo stuff.  French toast was some weird deep fried crap with oatmeal on the outside.   The fruit spread was just 2 bowls. One watermelon and one other melon cut into crude chunks is a $20 brunch... there should be beautifully sliced fruit... not disgusting hunks of fruit put in a bowl.)  The orange juice had a bizarre Tang like flavor to it.  We got up for 3 minutes after having only been there for 15 and when we came back they had cleared our table. How nice.   While the manager was a super nice lady the guy serving was below par. He was having a hard time doing the damn thing.   There has got to be much better out there.

Oh and the German Chocolate cake was ok.   On the other hand, the mushy egg rolls and funky dried out cinnamon muffins were inedible.  And our service was horrible.  Our waitress was EXTREMELY slow... and I mean that both physically and mentally.  We asked for sodas for our group 4-5 separate times and she NEVER go them right.  Two diets, two rootbeers and two Sierra Mists.  Is that really THAT hard?  What's worse is it seemed like she couldn't have cared any less that she kept bringing us the wrong drinks.  She would just shrug and take the wrong ones over to another table.  Pretty lame.

My husband got the $5 all you can drink wine/beer/cocktail though, I guess it was what worth...  It was funny that that evening we came home, we got another free dinner at seasons buffet again, I don't think we would go though even it was free so now you know how bad it was...",

    "text": "Had better buffets! Luckily this was free! My friend got a coupon in the mail and he invited me to come, my guess it is Hawaiian nite, being that there were many Hawaiian dishes, food was just okay but the most worrisome thing was that there are no dedicated serving utensils for each dish, and you have to use the same utensil for serving multiple items, I have a allergy to shrimp, and at the pasta area, the lady used the same spoon to ladle each ingredient, they have shrimp and clams to make pasta and the same spoon was used for garlic, cheese, onions etc , I told her I had allergies and she said it was fine, and continued making my dish, after 1 taste my mouth became itchy and irratated! My allergy is not as bad as some people's , so I have to wonder how many people they have injured or made sick due to this lack of basic food safety techniques??? If u have any allergies I would highly recommend staying away from here! Such a shame, you can tell they spent alot of money on decor ,because it is very nicely decorated but , I think they should have spent the money teaching their employees basic food safety !! Well I'm off to get some , benedryll!! Be warned!!",

    "text": "My favorite part of Vegas is the trip home. It has slowly become a tradition to eat here on the way out of Las Vegas. Although our whole group of girls loves this place, I am probably the only one who looks forward to leaving more than anything else for two very delicous words: crab legs.  The one thing I have spent my buffet eating trips loving is shrimp and cocktail sauce. Especially when there horseradish standing by. Now although I am still quite enamored with them, I think I have found my buffet soulmate in crab legs. Simply amazing. I am lucky enough to have a Tina Z. in my life who used to work at Red Lobster and has taught me the kung fu art that is extracting crab meat from the shells, but you'll figure it out. Trust me. Hot or cold. With or without fatty butter. I am starving just thinking about them and a little sad that I don't have my next trip out there planned yet.   Anyway, for those who don't obsess like me, the rest of the buffet is also excellent. Waffles with strawberry topping or funky french toast covered in crunchy oat things. Pizza with a side of full roasted garlic heads (you read that right, not cloves, heads). Oh and my other weird obsession, bagles with smoked salmon and cream cheese. So good. The dessert bar is also pretty amazing. I fell deeply in love with their coffee flavored flan of some sort. And many flavors of ice cream! Blueberry pie! Man it's a good thing they're located in a different state beacuse I don't have the time to go to as many TKB classes as it would take to burn off these calories.  Oooh and the mimosa bar. Not sure if it's an everyday thing, but on Sunday there's a mimosa bar in which you can have champagne and pureed orange, mango, white peach, and a couple of other flavors. By Sunday alcohol is not usually on my list of what I want to drink, but I have started to try a glass here or there.  Whenever you can find the time to fit this place into your Vegas trip, make it happen. Oh and you'll only spend ~$20 for a Sunday burnch. So worth it.",

    "text": "If I could give this place zero stars I would.  My husband and I had three free dinner vouchers which was perfect since we were staying three nights.  We ate the first night and the food was not very good.  Both of us had a hard time finding things that we actually liked.  We thought that maybe it was due to it being kind of late and decided to give it a second try the next day, especially since it was free.  About an hour or so after we ate both of us had major upset stomachs.  So the second day we went earlier, but it was the same story.  Neither of us could really find anything that was very good and my husband only made it half way through dinner before he had to run to the bathroom.  I'm not saying it was food poisoning because it could have just been that the food didn't agree with our stomachs, but we complained to the managers and instead of pretending like they cared (because I know they really don't but its their job to at least pretend like they do) they tried to blame it on the half a hamburger my husband ate at HIS OWN WORK before we left for vegas (my husband is the manager at his restaurant) and they never apologized.  I only asked for one thing from the managers and it wasn't free nights at the hotel or anything.  The only thing I asked for was if they could comp us some pepto bismol from the guest shop and they wouldn't even do that.  We ended up spending most of our vacation in the bathroom and even went home a day early.    So to sum it up, don't even eat there if it's free.  IT'S NOT WORTH IT.",

The choice of food that was offered wasnt bad until you ate it! Not lying I filled my plate full of the seemingly decent buffet food brought it back to my table and was so disapointed with the flavor. The words my mom use to tell me growing up is right never judge a book by its cover! The food didnt look terrible but man every single bite I took I wanted to puke.   I must have filled my plate up four times and left it on the table full of food. The waiterss even asked is everything ok? I told her the food was eaither under cooked or over cooked or had a funky flavor.   I gave up on getting the poor quality food from the buffet bar and went to there pasta bar were they make to order hoping for a fresh cooked plate of pasta. I picked what I would use at home to make an awesome Alfredo and gave my plate to the older man who could hardly speak English. After telling him what sauce I wanted he dumped half a bottle of olive oil and water in a frying pan heated the oil and dumped all my fixings in the pan. As I stood there watching him basically deep fry my food he asked what noodle you want yest just like that!! I said fedachinie noodle he said no we no have then he pulls a box out of the cooler under the stove and squeeze a load of spaghetti noodles in his tongs and says this what we have. Um ok that will work. So he throws the noodles in the frying pan and then turns around behind him and fills his spoon with Alfredo sauce dumps it in the pan at lets it simmer. No I didn't miss a step he never drained the gallon of oil! He says ok finished and dumps the slop on my plate oil and all. Sorry I usually tip but not this guy!   I bring the plate back to my table thinking it cant be that bad I'm hungry and need to eat!! I sat down dug my fork into the noodle and took one bite and spit it back out on my plate! I can not tell you how nasty it was. After inspecting my plate my wife says holy crap babe look at all the oil separating from the sauce on your plate. It made me sick so yet another plate left.   On to the deserts now I was done trying to get a hot meal maybe they have some pie or ice cream or something. Yeah just like everything else every pie looked like it was a week old and there cream things just looked that things.   I'm very surprised that this place was the worst buffet ever. I mean it looked like it was an upscale place. You look around and you feel like your dining in an expensive restaurant I dont get it.",

What's with that as they advertise 2 for 1 with players card but I guess they want to make you jump through hoops! While the selection & variety is not  overwhelming (no fried chicken?) the positives are: friendly efficient staff, good salad bar selection, tender turkey (didn't try the beef), peel & eat shrimp, enough selection to entice you. Too bad there is no more wine or beer ad on available. Just average or below average but worth it if you get a discount.",

    "text": "Came here on Xmas Sunday on the way home to LA.  Came here around 1:30pm and there was barely a line.  Only fail is that there was only one cashier and she took forever.  At a normal buffet on the strip, it should have taken 2 minutes max to process customers.  When it was time for me to pay, the cashier asked if I had a players card.  I told her no and she said that it would save me $2 off per person and all I would need is 1 card for the entire party.  Seeing that there was 5 people in our party, it would have saved me $10.  I told her that I didn't want to go get the card as I didn't want to stand in another line.  But she insisted that I get the card.  So I obliged and picked up the card.  Anyways, there was a promo that day that if you play and get 50 points, you get a free buffet.  Too bad I didn't have time as the buffet closes at 2:30 I believe.   The Sunday brunch was a Bellini themed brunch which also served Mimosas champagne & beer all for $18 per person with the players card.  For those of you looking at the whole pig, that's only on Saturdays during the Polynesian themed dinner.   The decor inside is very nice and looked high end.  The food area was clean for the most part, but small.  It's your typical buffet and nothing about it will really wow you.  Some of the food was pretty tasty but for the most part, it's pretty decent.  I really liked the eggs benedict.  It was served in what looks like a cupcake paper liner.  I thought it was a good idea since you don't end up breaking the egg yolk while trying to pick it up like other buffet places where they just put like 12 eggs benedict next to each other and you have to pick it up the right way without the sauce, yolk or ham falling off.  I thought it was one of the better eggs benedict I've had.  The sauce has a touch of lemon tartness and the ham wasn't dry.  The english muffin wasn't hard as a rock either.   The prime rib was overcooked and on the tough side even though it was on the medium side.   The steamed clams was a bit salty but it was flavorful.  I almost forgot, the Posole was probably the best I've had.  It had just the right flavor combination.  Was not bland like a lot of places I've been to here in LA.  There was big chunks of meat and it was tender and not dry at all.   Like most buffets, there were different stations ranging from Chinese to Mexican to American.  Overall I would liked this place as it's not crowded and won't burn a hole in your pockets.  I would like to try their Polynesian nights but I've heard that it can really get crowded.  So come early if you plan on eating here on Saturday.",

We dined here Friday night which was seafood night. Adults, which they considered age 7 & up, were $22.99 & kids aged 4,5, & 6 were half price. I made sure we got our money's worth with the many plates of crab legs we ate. It also came with complimentary beer & wine but I can't say for sure if this is nightly or just the seafood buffet. They had the usual favorites for kids such as pasta, pizza, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes etc.   The dessert buffet was tasty with a good variety of cakes, pies, & other pastries. They even had a selection of sugar free desserts for those seeking them. My favorite was the more than half dozen flavors of ice cream made in-house. They even had root beer floats made to order.  All in all, I was happy with our buffet experience and the kids were happy with it too. On top of all the great food selections, the service was awesome & that usually isn't the case with a party of 18. I would definitely go back here again if I stay in the same area the next time around. But based on the other reviews, I may stick to Friday night seafood fare.",

It took 15 minutes to get my first drink, getting a refill was a joke, and he would walk by several times without clearing away the dirty plates. They weren't that busy and he had zero sense of urgency so it wasn't like he was busy.   Action stations weren't staffed so trying to get your meat cut or a pasta made was almost impossible. The Sous Chef himself actually saw that I was waiting for a long time and got an employee to help me- kudos to that chef for being on top of things!   Manager was seating guests and was very unprofessional calling guests \"baby\". I watched her get in an argument in front of me with my server Chang as well as a table that had one too many people. She even threw her hands up in the air at the guests, yikes!   This was my second time to this buffet and the first time was phenomenal so maybe I just caught them on a bad day, I don't know!",

    "text": "This buffet is one of the brunch buffets I haven't been to, and seeing as how it's close to where I live I figured I'd check it out. While in the car I was reading reviews on here and started second guessing my decision. There were such AWFUL reviews I was nervous but figured since I had a BOGO coupon it would be worth it even if it was meh.  When we arrived the atmosphere was great, I loved the layout of the place. They have a BELLINI BAR! They offer peach, pomegranate, mango, and raspberry bellinis as well as mimosas! And they're all included in the brunch buffet. I've had build you own bloody bars but choose your own bellinis? I was impressed.  I held my breath walking up to the food and let out a sigh of relief when I saw that not only was it clean, everything looked fresh. My first plate was stereotypically brunch. I got waffles, an egg frittata, bacon, sausage, and a blintz. The waffles were actually soft unlike any buffet I've been to, usually they're hard as a rock from being under a heat lamp. The bacon was thick and delicious, the egg frittata was good. Overall my first plate impressed me as I was expecting dry, gross food.  The second plate I loaded with mac and cheese, turkey from the carving station, stuffing, and mashed potatoes which I smothered in gravy. I also got some sort of Mexican soup. The turkey was moist, the gravy perfect, and the mashed potatoes were to die for. I don't know why I was in a thanksgiving food mood but I was, and it was awesome.  For dessert I got a Boston creme cake and a red velvet cupcake. Both were excellent. I had about five different bellinis. Overall it's the best brunch buffet I've been to in Vegas aside from wicked spoon, which is higher end anyway so you can't really compare the two.  I have no idea what all the bad reviews were about but DEFINITELY eat brunch here.",

This is by far the worst casino buffet we've been to. Fried food is dry and hard enough to be a weapon. If there is food fight in this buffet, people will seriously get hurt. I got chicken fry steak. Took a bite, feel like I was biting into a hockey pot. Shrimp popcorn, hard and chewy.   Sushi display is something I've never seen before. Usually sushi station is clean and organized. But not this one, sushi is piled up on top of each other, rice got stick to each other, filling is falling out. It looks like a one big plate of sushi fry rice.   Every single station we saw was messy and not clean. We never seen a buffet this messy and not organized. As we watched the employees who prepared the food behind the station, we realized why.   Unlike most buffet, most buffet when food it out, they pick up the tray, clean the area, put in fresh tray of fresh food. But not this buffet, the employees put food on top of old ones, they don't even bother pick up the old tray, they simple scoop the new food and slap into the old tray. As a result, food is getting more salty, hardened, messier....  we don't know how's the new chef and what the \"good yelp review \" were talking about. Don't believe those. They are NOT TRUE.",

When we ate here Sunday, that stayed as usual.    The grilled vegetables were very good.  I always like their roasted garlic pieces, but this night, the roast beef was cooked until the cow could walk no more.  It was deep, deep brown.  Overcooked completely!  The spicy tofu in the Asian section was very good and the deserts rounded out the evening on the plus side.  I had some peach ice cream and a piece of carrot cake.  A nice way to end a meal.  The service was very good.  There weren't very many people in the restaurant Sunday night so the servers were stretched to the limit.  I'll come back here and I'll find something quite good again and something that I avoid or isn't quite as good.  The place has lost some of the luster it had when it first opened.",

I normally love their grilled vegetables but tonight they were a little dried out.  But after all these visits I finally discovered they have a grilled fish taco area.  They limit two per customer which was fine with me they were surprisingly very tasty is come back just for them.  Their hot wings didn't disappoint as always they were grub!  Our servers were great our drinks never made t half way.  Usually it's a chore keeping the kids drinks full but not here.  The dessert bar was amazing and that says a lot because I'm not a big dessert fan.  Keep it up!",

    "text": "Hubby and I had some out of town guests and they wanted a \"Chinese buffet\", this was the closest buffet to where they were parked.   We, being from Vegas, were not impressed for a Sunday night buffet. The buffet itself is very small in comparison to many others. The food was not terrible, but I wouldn't give it rave reviews either. Hubby tried the Ahi Poke, took one bite and didn't eat the rest, I could tell my looking at the barely pink ahi it was not fresh and tried to warn him (he thought maybe they put a 'sauce' on it that made it that color, he tried it anyway. Not good, not sauce, just not fresh. They had Round Sirloin that my hubby thoroughly enjoyed, I felt it was over cooked and very dry, luckily they offered au jus and horseradish. The au jus had bay leaves floating it, I felt that was weird considering it looked like it came from a package, and had very little flavor, I think they added too much water to the package. I had a salad I made myself, of course, its a buffet, but the eggs (I believe it was the eggs), tasted like soap. I tried each bit of my salad separately, thinking maybe it was the plate, or my fork, but only when I grabbed some egg did I get the soapy flavor. It was weird, and I didn't finish the salad that was left due to it having egg. I tried the pizole, I have nothing to compare that to since it was my first time every having it. It was good, there was a nice hunk of meat in it and it had a flavor that I enjoyed. I tried their spring roll, w/sweet sour sauce, the spring roll was good, but the sauce was way to sugary for my liking, and not enough sour. For desert I had lemon meringue pie and carrot cake. The lemon meringue was good, and the carrot cake was good once I cut the hard sides off it (they need to take note and put paper on the sides to avoid this like other buffets do), but the frosting was to die for!   All in all, we will be back, we definitely want to try to Polynesian night. Hubby is polynesian and this is a must, especially with all the wonderful reviews of it. I will update then.",

The Crab legs looked like they had been run over by a truck , they were all squashed with no meat in them. The Fish was dry and looked terrible. I asked for a slice of the Prime Rib and when he cut it it was so thin that I told the server that he almost missed the beef when he cut it. The deserts were all dry and when I tried to cut a piece of Lemon meringue  pie with my fork it stuck on the fork and pulled off the Lemon filling. NEVER AGAIN will I go there.

I arrived at 10:30am for the Sunday brunch and it was a short line and quickly seated. Good selection of food and what makes this buffet five stars, is that they have a champagne brunch attendant with five or so options for drink, unlike other local brunch offerings. Bring tip money for the employee pouring the champagne, she is worth it. The drink station is worth the additional price, when compared to Buffet Brunch at Stations. They won me over and that's the name of the game!!",

    "text": "Went here cus it's the closest buffet to my parents' house (besides the M) while I was in town visiting for the holidays. Dad also had a 50% off coupon so ... score! Overall food is better than wedding banquet catering and the Steak was surprisingly great. Some dishes were a bit more on the salty side which I didn't mind, at least it was better than the blander dishes on their seasonal menu. But the most surprising dish of all was the sausage stuffing. It was actually super tasty and just the right thing I wanted for the holidays. Everything else was okay, and slightly above average. At its price, I think it offers great value for what you're paying. We lucked out because there was not a long wait to be seated (I wouldn't wait more than 20 mins in line for this, to be honest)",

Twice.  Located inside Silvertons a few miles from the strip, Seasons offers a wide array of different foods, from Chinese to Mexican to good ol' American favorites. The prices are right, and the service is excellent (everyone except for one of the cashiers - I believe her name was Amelia).   Overall, great experience though. I would eat at this buffet a third time if we'd stayed a few days longer.",

My only problem with this buffet is that the smoke around the area is very distinct. It's hard for me to bring my kids here because of the smoke in the casino. I think like all buffets in casinos, smoke is inevitable. Best deal is lunch on a Tuesday, I think it was less than $15 for sure. I have not been in the Polynesian buffet yet but I will eventually try it and let you know if it's worth it.",

They had a whole roasted pig, laulau, lomi salmon, poke, mac salad, seafood salad with cucumbers and imitation crab, Kalua pork and cabbage, teriyaki beef and lots more, plus the basic stuff like sushi, pasta, shrimp, etc...  To bad I got full off of two plates and a piece of lemon meringue pie (my favorite)... It wasn't to busy because we got in right when dinner started at 4pm... It's like any typical buffets here in Vegas... But I like this one a little bit more because they have Polynesian nights... Everyone that works there are very friendly.... That's also a plus! I'll be back again... :)",

The roast beef was awful and chewy, the turkey extremely dry, the bread sticks was hard and not enjoyable and finally the dessert was like eating Play-Doh.  Yes the chicken noodle soup was good, and the rice pilaf and sausages were ok, but everything else wasn't pleasant at all.  My wife didn't enjoy the good and she have gotten sick and wasn't pleased.  I hope management can see this message and correct the issue.  You can even keep my money I am not looking for compensation .

Impressive buffet for the price.  We went after hiking in Red Rock on Saturday morning and arrived hungry only to find that the Silverton buffet was offering brunch and was a little more expensive than anticipated.  Still, it being Vegas we decided to splurge and were not disappointed.  The buffet included an excellent prime rib, crab legs, cedar smoked salmon, osso bucco (oh so yummy) and a variety of shellfish (plus more, much more).  Some other standouts were the granola french toast, biscuits and gravy and of course the usual assortment of desserts.  For about the price of a lunch buffet on the strip, you get all this?  Very worth taking the trek to the Silverton.    Plus, we hadn't been to Las Vegas in several years and boy what a difference those years made!  The Silverton has all growed up! Our little boy loved the outdoor world and what has to be the biggest fish tank outside of an aquarium we have ever seen.",

The hubby & I decided to get there a bit early to make sure we get our Silverton players card & free buffet.  Yay for free food we were going to pay for anyway!  The line wasn't too bad for a Friday night and it was their seafood buffet too!  The service was okay, not slow, but we did have to flag him down a time or two.    Now, the food, the only reason to hit a buffet.  Meh.  Yes, that's my official review of the food.  I didn't touch the crab (I'm still traumatized from Darin C.'s picture, I really can't get that out of my head) but tried other seafood items.  It's really small compared to other casino buffets, but there was a decent amount of choices.  The prime rib was okay, I was able to get the yummy end that wasn't overcooked.  The hubby appreciated he could get his order grilled and not have to eat it medium rare.  There were fried seafood (shrimp, catfish) choices that got a thumbs up from the hubby.  Baby enjoyed herself, mainly because she loved all the compliments she kept getting from strangers.  She did look sad when they left and no one was telling her how cute she looked in her pigtails and new dress.  (A sudden vision of whats to come)  Anyways, would I go back?  Probably not, but it wouldn't be the worst place to end up.  We may end up there for lunch during the week (can't really complain too much about $5 pp during weekdays) when we visit the fish.  She is really loving those fish!",

The brunch buffet itself was pretty good.  Lots of choices, although the dessert station was a little underwhelming.  There was a champagne bar where the server would make any variety of champagne desired.  My only complaint was that there was a huge seafood section with crab legs, and I would've eaten a different meal at the buffet had I known that.  Looking at all the giant piles of half-eaten crab legs kind of makes me ill.  But it's a buffet - the gluttony shouldn't be surprising.  Service was good, although we were seated in the back section, where the tables are very cramped.  All-in-all, though, it was pretty good for a free buffet.  If you eat there, join the player's club because it discounts the buffet price and the club is free to join.  They also have a Polynesian night on Thursday nights, which looked like it could be really cool.",

Okay, so i exaggerated, but you will see plenty of \"local-kine\" people there on Polynesian night. The \"ahi tartar\" (aka poke) is better on Thursdays, a  little more salty than the other days which means IT'S ONO. I had this clam chowder there once that I couldn't get off my brain! I keep going back, but the soup doesn't show up again. darn. But seriously, for a decent price ($21.99/person if i'm not mistaken) AYCE polynesian/island style food is pretty damn good in my opinion.  Friday nights are seafood nights, Saturday nights are steak AND seafood nights, and the food is phenomenal for a decent-sized buffet.

    "text": "There is the time for a bountiful buffet for the price of $5 on Mondays & Tuesdays. My Mom and I went to this casino to watch the Mermaid Fish Feeding Show but saw their $5 Seasons Buffet ad as we walked out of the elevator. It sounded a good deal so we lined up for the buffet. With a price like that, naturally who would let that pass? There was a line of people waiting to get in, both locals and tourist. But it's all worth the wait. Immediate service upon getting seated. Our drink orders were taken and served fast. Generous food on the buffet line-up. Self-service, all-you-can-eat. Seafood (with crawfish, shrimps, crab legs among others), Salad Bar and Desserts (includes my favorite German chocolate cake. It was rich and creamy and loved the mint ice cream with my preferred toppings of nuts, chocolate fudge, butterscotch cream, sprinkles, M&Ms), Italian, Meat Carving Station, Grilled Vegetabes, Asian, Mexican, Soups, Fresh Fruit, and American cuisine. Hush puppies, Pecan Pie and Prime Rib were excellent. Food is tasty through all the bites. Ever-hospitable servers and buffet station servers were attentive. \"Live Action\" Chefs cook food fresh. Food servers dressed in brown country-style outfits with boots. Booths and table seatings abound in this large dining room. Decor is very pleasing for a hotel that's somewhat new. We go to this buffet at least twice a month.  Mondays are also Seniors All-Day Buffet Day at this Seasons \"Live Action\" Buffet at Silverton Lodge Casino at 11am-8pm for $5. Seafood Buffet on Dinner Fridays for $22.99 and Polynesian Buffet on Thursdays for $20.99.

Had not been here for awhile, but we saw an ad for bogo and decided to try again. Glad we did as they have a new executive chef who has revamped the menu and added some more interesting and fresh items. For example, the deep fried tofu salad with chilli and the keifer lime stir fry chicken. Can't go wrong with a selection of roasted vegetables (jalapenos and garlic included) or the fresh shrimp and cocktail sauce. All in all (bogo - $7.50 a person), if you make wise choices, you can get a great meal.",

    "text": "First, for the purpose of full disclosure, my husband and I received a coupon for buy one get one free at this buffet. I checked the reviews and figured it was worth a try. I should have checked the \"not recommended\" reviews section on yelp. This place was awful. Completely inedible garbage. It's rather suspicious that only the good reviews are shown and all the negatives are hidden. We went on Wednesday night at about 6:30pm for dinner. My husband had the Tomato Basil bisque, roasted chicken, and white rice. His thoughts were that the soup was actually a paste, the consistency of glue, the chicken was like cardboard, and the rice was crunchy. I tried the chicken soup, roasted turkey, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, mac-n-cheese, stuffing and cranberry sauce (I was desperate to find anything worth eating). The chicken soup almost definitely came from a can, the turkey was juicy but devoid of any and all seasoning, corn on the cob looked promising but tasted like nothing at all and was somehow greasy, mashed potatoes were bland, mac had an off putting taste, stuffing was most likely a box and the cranberry sauce was totally canned. For dessert they kept with the theme. Pound cake that was dry and crumbly, strawberry sauce that clearly came from a frozen tub, and cookies that were probably sitting out all week. Look, I get that this place is cheap, but its really not that much less than other buffets in Vegas. Do yourself a favor, just say no and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "First off I'd like to say I've read a lot of the reviews for this place especially the newer reviews so I knew what we were getting into. With that being said I was still hoping to walk out and not feel guilty for blowing 50 bucks on dinner. Ofcourse it didnt work out that way. I still feel bad the next day. The only thing that saves me from getting really pissed was that we got to see the mermaid swim around in the huge aquarium in the casino area. She put on a great show so it was worth it in that respect.   I gave the place a star because at least the drink lady was nice to us. She seemed to be the only one actually working. The other buffet staff were just rude. I could even hear them complaining because we asked for a booth. That really pissed me off! I got a players card before we went to the buffet to get a slight discount. We still ended up paying $13.99 per adult. The kicker is they charged my 8 year old son adult price! I almost lost it. He hardly eats anything...well not like an adult anyway. They did charge my daughter half price because shes 6 years old. I assume she'll be an adult when she hits 7...lol. What a joke.   So the food flat out sucks. Most of the food tastes microwaved and even some stuff feels like its from the day before. Their wonton with crab was hard as a rock. I did like their bbq ribs. That was about the only thing that was decent. The guy cutting the rib roast was just hilarious. The first time I went to get a slice he gave me a paper thin slice. It was so tiny I thought he was joking but then he walked away... So I went back later to get another slice and I told him to give me a thick slice. Son of a b*tch gave me the same sized slice. So I asked for another slice. Bastard gives me another thin slice then he walks away. I was wondering if I was on some kind've hidden camera show or something. But after talking it over with my wife we came to the conclusion that they probably are told to only give small slices out because the one roast they have probably has to last the whole night. Just lame! So this place isn't worth it. For the same money other casinos have way better buffets and the quality is so much higher.",

We had the Saturday brunch which came complete with champagne.    There were all types of breakfast and lunch items.  The typical eggs, bacon, biscuit and gravy, waffles, french toast.  There were crab legs, a carvery with lamb, prime rib, turkey and stuffing, chinese food, italian food, mexican food, sushi, fruit, and desserts up the wazzoo!  Most of the items tasted fresh and we enjoyed tasting everything.  The regular price for brunch is $18, and on Saturday goes up to $21 for steak and seafood buffet for dinner.    I know they also offer a buy one get one free buffet certain times of the day, so check ahead so you don't have to pay full price.",

Midweek wasn't very busy, the food was as good as anything I've ever eaten here. Great roast turkey, nice corn with some peppers in it. The Chinese food is \"meh\", except for the crispy crab won tons. But I don't go here for Chinese food.

    "text": "stay off the strip and you definitely don't have to pay an arm and a leg for a buffet. $11 for a lunch buffet! hell yeah! plus, you don't have to wait in immensely long lines.   food here is good. the AC can get pretty cold, but the decor is nice. decorated with the different seasons, obviously, 'cause this place is called \"seasons.\" service was also really good and attentive.  pesto pizza was awesome. they also have a \"build your own pasta\" section, which i didn't do.....sadly. there's a lot of choices from different pastas to sauces to \"toppings\" like olives, artichokes, capers, etc. how cool is that?!  oh! they also have ridiculously awesome brownies. i'm not much of a dessert person, but i'm mad addicted to brownies, and i had to have TWO even though i was full already. moist, fudge-y and chewy. PERFECTO!",

    "text": "Decent Buffet for the price. I've been here a couple times for lunch and dinner. The variety is nice and the dessert section is great. I loved that they had pozole and bbq ribs. Once in a while they will have some deals like half off or by one get one free. The decor is really nice, newer spot and since its way off the strip not that busy. The service is good too, quick for refills and additional napkins. If you're in Vegas and have a rental, come out here, you will like it. The Silver ton itself is pretty and is right next door to the Bass Pro shop.",

    "text": "This is my favorite buffet in Vegas so far! I've been to the one at the Flamingo, Aladdin, The Orleans, etc. But this is the best one so far. It's super clean and there's so many different foods to choose from. They have american, asian, mexican, italian, etc. And they have great desserts to choose from. The few times that I've been here, it hasn't been crowded either. I can't wait to come back to this place!",

    "text": "Join the players club and get a free buffet with no strings attached. The weeknight I chose wasn't very crowded and there was just a short wait. As with most buffets, you must weed through some bad items to find the good ones. The things that shone through were the \"make your own Pasta Bar\" You fill a bowl of veggies and then chef cooks your choice of pasta and sauce. The penne alfredo w/garlic added was cooked perfectly and tasted like  a real homemade sauce and is almost good enough for an entire meal as they serve you a giant plate. Of course, you have to keep trying other stuff. Also in the very good category were Fried Clams (crispy), Fried Shrimp, creamed corn (with peppers), lima beans and pearl onions and they had some decent carving stations if you like sausage and red meats. I was hoping for turkey. Overall the deserts and salad's were very average and the polenta, minestrone soup and a few other dishes did not cut the mustard. Clearly, this is great if it's free, but  d at 15 bucks is probably a bit too high to return for a local. Might as well try another place on Strip for that price. Also the summer peach ice cream/gelato was tasteless.",

The fried shrimp is good, they used to have this pepper  shrimp dish but the last couple of time I went they haven't had it, Little disappointed.
