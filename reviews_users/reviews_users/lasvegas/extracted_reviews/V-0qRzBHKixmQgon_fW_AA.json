So I ordered the chicken teriyaki salad w/ sweet onion dressing.. Im the type of person that hates salad but I'm trying to eat healthy and I'm so glad I ordered it.. That was one of the best salads I ever had in my life. I am definitely coming back to this place . I just wish they can put a little bit more meat on the salad but other than that it was perfect! :)",

I like the simple menu, and the fresh take on the usual Hawaiian.  The service is fast and friendly, and we recommend it to everyone who comes into our store (which is nearby).",

Don't forget the tangy spicy Katsu sauce for dipping.... delicious! Hubby goes with the teriyaki chicken, spicy poke, and rich Mac salad. You can't really go wrong with their menu! There is often a line, so don't be in a hurry, you'll want to enjoy your food on island time!!",

Menu has several add-on fees for options like brown rice (50 cents extra), choice of steak ($1/serving extra), and poke (two options, $1.25/serving extra), but base prices are pretty reasonable.   PROS: Pulehu steak has good flavor, Kahlua pig is tender, both poke options were fresh. They have several sauces by the drink station, no extra charge if you want to get more than one salad dressing. The kimchee slaw and garlic edamame sides were better than expected.  CONS: Brown rice was crunchy, steak is fatty and doesn't need an extra charge, poke portions are tiny so buy by the pound instead, salad is served pre-tossed with tongs so majority of toppings fall to bottom and you receive mostly lettuce... Management should look into adding toppings by hand for those who order salad as an entree.  Some items need a little improvement but I liked what I got and would come again. BF isn't much of a Hawaiian food fan and he cleared his plate. Total for two orders (large plate, poke salad) was about $25 without drinks.  EDIT: Still keeping it four stars, but inconsistencies with the poke prevent me from ordering it here. Staff don't fill the tiny cups to a set amount, some customers get overflowing cups and some are barely filled to the top. Order by the pound or not at all.",

You can select from several different sizes varying from a small bowl with one protein option to the largest option that allows you to choose three different proteins. On my first visit I ordered the poke, kalua pork and pulehu steak with brown rice. The kalua pork was good but not great but the poke and and pulehu steak were tasty. On my second visit I went with the Mochiko chicken and poke salad which was delicious.   I enjoy that they offer so many health options and allow you to choose brown rice or salad in place of white rice. I look forward to returning soon for some more poke and Mochiko chicken. The prices are reasonable but can get high as you add additional add-ons.",

Once you enter you get into the queue/line to the left and there's a huge menu that describes the size of the plates and what it comes with. Since it was my first time here with my kuya last week, we ended up asking a bunch of questions and were given some really friendly service and great advice on what to order. The lady that helped us as well as the lady that cashed us out (I'm sorry, I wish I knew their names!) was soo sweet and helped us order within minutes.   TIP: We wanted to try almost everythingggg, and ended up making the most of our money by adding a quarter pound of poke each because it's just a bit larger than what they would give you if it was a \"meat side\"!   DELICIOUS food, great and friendly service, and the portions are pretty generous for the amount that you pay. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm on this side of town!  EDIT: their names are Kim & Chelsey! I came in and they both were there just as friendly as before! Thanks ladies!",

We did Chicken Teriyaki, Katsu Chicken, Kalua Pork, Mac Salad, Kimchee spicy slaw, and tossed salad with sweet sesame dressing.  We also had both white and brown rice.  The overall tab was very reasonable at about $300.  Our guests raved about the food, and kept asking the address so they could go on their own!  Mahalo!   You made our party a big success!!",

Kalua pig at other places can be too salty but this place is perfect. The poke was also really good... I recommend the spicy poke because it is more flavorful than the Hawaiian poke, it is more creamy and the little kick is very tasty. The garlic edamame was good too, the kimchi slaw had a weird flavor to it.. Not my favorite. The only con was the rice, there were a few pieces of really hard rice on my two scoops, not a big deal.   The bowl/plate comes in different sizes, I recommend getting the medium which comes with a base (white rice or brown rice), two meats and two sides. Portion is not crazy big, decent portion for one person.",

This place is legitimately delicious! And not the small kine! I literally stopped eating my food to write this review.   Upon entering this restaurant, you're kindly greeted by one of the brothers, he shows you his meats ;), and you make your creations!  The price point is seriously on point, 4.99 1 meat, 6.99 2 meats, and 8.49 3 meats ($1 extra per serving for steak and $1.25 extra per serving for poke.) Of course sides and a base. I decided to balls to the wall and get one of each, minus pork. The pulehu steak is seriously melt in your mouth delicious! Best I've ever had! The pulehu chicken is so succulent and delectable! The Ahi Poke in island style is out of this world! I don't even like fish! Katsu is tasty and not greasy! Mac salad is buttery and flavorful! And I'm legit the mac salad master, and this one is bomb!  The inside of this place is clean and beautiful and the employees seriously care here. They make sure the food is delicious and you are completely satisfied. I am just seriously blown away!   I don't even live on this side of town, but I promise I will be here once a week! It's seriously, hella bomb! Man, I will add more to this, but food here is seriously onolicious!  Aloha!!!",

I told my husband it's kind of like going to a bbq/potluck at a friend's house (in a good way). I love places like Giada's, Barrymore and Echo & Rig, but sometimes I just want a good meal, no rich sauces, simple, quick and at an affordable price. Makai hits the nail right on the head!  I had the Ono'er (2 meats, 2 sides, rice) - pulehu steak, kalua pig, garlic edamame, mac salad and rice for $8! A great deal in my opinion. Everything was really good and filling. The only bummer was they were out of poke, but we'll definitely be back so hopefully we can try it next time.  The decor is clean and contemporary. And another highlight is they're two doors down from a favorite dessert spot...Sweet Addiction! What more can I ask for?",

Any other restaurants I've been at would give you a larger cup size.  Without a water fountain and the ability to put my head under the drink machine, I found this to be poor customer service and enough to not come back.  It is 110 degrees here.  Also, not sure how this relates to customer availability to drinking water at restaurants. Will check with the state.",

I ordered the Medium bowl with teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, brown rice, kimchee slaw (10/10 for kimchee lovers), and the garlic edamame.    The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection, it was still moist and not covered in an unnecessary amount of teriyaki sauce. The chicken katsu was perfectly crispy and the inside was soft and juicy! The kimchee slaw was delicious on so many levels. I'll probably end up getting double kimchi slaw the next time! They do have furikake so make sure you ask for it and put it on your rice for some extra flavor!   Now the only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because of their poke. I had a couple of bites of my gf's poke, and it was a little too salty. I checked with her and my other friend to make sure it wasn't just me, and they agreed. I'm sure it was probably just this batch of poke, so I'll make sure to come back and try it again because this place is still bomb!",

You pick your size (ono, ono'er or ono'est, i.e. small, medium or large), proteins, base (white or brown rice) and your sides and you're done. They also have salads and a bowl (2 protein and one base).  For the proteins, I've tried the teriyaki, katsu and pulehu steak and chicken. The teriyaki is pretty basic but the pulehu was moist and tender.  I've yet to try the poke but it looks delicious.  Side note: beef items are $1.00 more and poke is $1.75 more).  As for the sides, try the kimchee slaw, it's soo good.  The mac salad is fine so, if you don't want to waste the calories on \"fine,\" try the garlic edamame or corn as well.

When we arrived on a Saturday afternoon it wasn't crazy busy at all maybe one family sitting down when we entered.   So the place is very clean and with a good amount of tables for people to sit in. It's a pick and choose type of restaurant which I haven't seen before in a Hawaiian restaurant. They have different combos to choose from. I got the medium which was two meats and one base (rice), also including two sides. They have two versions of the steak which was typical teriyaki and the pulehu steak. I was curious what the pulehu was, the lady said it was garlic, salt, and pepper. So I got both steak options with garlic edamame and kimchee slaw. My BF got the kalua pork and pulehu steak.   So the garlic edamame was the highlight of my meal. It had so much flavor and the only thing was I wished it was hot but it's not a big deal. The slaw was ok I probably wouldn't get it again. So for the steaks there were both a little dry for me and lacking flavor. And the rice they serve us, was hard and had a lot of crunchy pieces. I dipped the steaks in their steak sauce which just had A1 flavor and their spicy teriyaki which was good and needed it for sure. My BF said the kalua was good but hard to eat the meal because the rice was so hard. He said he absolutely loved the corn.   I will say the price is cheap and you get a lot of food.   I really want to give this place more stars but it just seemed like the items could have been better it was 12:00 when we  came in which I thought was prime time lunch hour.",

Perception is everything and even if she just washed her hands- I didn't see that so I am left to assume she hadn't.   When I got home I looked at my poke as I ordered a pound. The color was off because of the oxidation but when I took one piece you could immediately tell it was not good.  To me it tasted a little old so I spit it out. I had my husband try and he said they changed the product and the quality.  I called because the other visits were so good with the exception of one visit where the rice was hard. I asked to speak with a manager or owner... I basically explained my disappointment and asked only for a refund on the poke (not my whole meal) stating that I could bring it back so they can see that we didn't eat it. He declined the refund after noting they did change products and were changing back next week but that this was still a nice product. I told him if they truly believed it was good then they wouldn't have a reason to change back to the original. I told him that was fine, if he didn't want to refund me since it's not good and the product I had several times before that he has lost a customer. As a business owner I would think you would want to keep you customers but since they are a fast food style place they can't grasp that concept. He said we can't start doing refunds on poke as if they plan to continue to serve a bad product.  Generally, I like to give my business to small business / local owners because they are trying hard to succeed but maybe that's not the case and they feel they've already made the big time.",

I have been there so many times ever since they opened and never been let down. Love it!",

I chose the Mochiko chicken wings as my 2nd meat - never had it before - and yum. Of course, that meant I didn't get as much katsu as I would have liked, but what I had was pretty good, crispy and still moist. Down side, they didn't pack any sauce and didn't mention it. So I don't know if you're supposed to grab a container or ask.  The staff behind the counter were really friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be going back again...maybe a large order next time",

First they offer vegetables on their menu but have been out of them for the past couple weeks, on Wednesday they also eliminated one of the chicken options, and were out of the corn and poke. Clearly not well run if they have all of these issues. Also the women who took our order and made our food, could not have been any less interested. No apologies for being out of things or anything, just let us know like she could care less. Disappointing, I have high hopes for this place but I don't think I will be returning.",

I ordered the large, with katsu chicken, kalua pig, & the spicy poke. Sides were white rice with garlic edamame & macaroni salad.  The chicken & pig were super good. The katsu was not dry at all and tasted great with the sauce. The pig was juicy and had great flavor.  Garlic edamame was basic but good. And macaroni salad was great, better than L&L in my opinion.  The spicy poke was good at first but it got a but salty and I ended up not finishing it.   Overall, would definitely come back when I'm craving Hawaiian food! :-)",

The lack of traffic definitely did not reflect the quality here! I had never been in before but the girl behind the line was nice enough to make some suggestions and walk me thru my best options. I ended up having a salad with both poke and topped with kimchi slaw and the ginger dressing. The kimchi slaw was awesome!! We also got a side of garlic edamame. Everything was great. I like that they have homemade hot sauces available as you leave. They were both good, but the spicier one was delicious on my salad.

I could eat a pound of their spicy Hawaiian poke by myself if I could. They also have salads, too and their sesame dressing goes really well with their entrees.

    "text": "Makai has all the right elements to make for a great fast casual Hawaiian restaurant. A build-your-own plate style menu, a clean eating environment, and decent service, but when it all comes down to their food, it needs a little tweaking.   I'm aware I'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to Hawaiian food, but I know what tastes good, and whether or not management is being stingy.   I ordered the Ono'er (the medium sized plate). It includes 2 scoops of rice, 2 choices of meat, and 2 choices of sides. I got myself the teriyaki chicken, kalua pig, and a side of macoroni salad, and kimchi slaw.   As a server builds up my plate, I watch him for a good 10 seconds each, picking out the smallest portions of meat he could find. Does he not think it looks bad on him to place a larger piece of chicken on my plate, only to put it back and replace it with a significantly smaller piece? At least they weren't stingy on the sides.   Before you dig in, it's highly recommended to pick up one of the sauce bottles that are accompanied by forks and napkins. I prefer the Yaki sauce, even on the chicken katsu. The katsu sauce tastes too much like ketchup.   The thing is, the food is good. But you have to douse every meat with the Yaki sauce, or else they'll taste a tad bland. The meat can also sometimes be a little dry. It's all these small things that add up. I really want to like this place, but they'll need to work on quality control for me to keep coming back.",

You get to select what size you want, the smallest being 1 meat and 1 side. The next would be 2 meats and 2 sides. There were even options to make your own bowl or do an a la carte selection.  I chose the smallest. This was $5 and honestly was pretty satisfying - did not make me too full but I was good. It'd be a great lunch size.   I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of garlic edamame and you get your choice of rice. Brown rice was a little extra, fyi.   The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection. They have a station next to the drinks that has teriyaki sauce (+ a spicy version if you so desire) so you can add more or add it to your rice like I did!  The garlic edamame was cold. I'm wondering if you can ask for it to be warmed up as I didn't like it as much cold.   Overall the food was enjoyable and I'd come here again for either a quick lunch or dinner. Definitely possible to go in & out if you're on a time crunch and the options give you a variety where you can try something new every time you come!",

    "text": "Spotted the gem on yelp and slapped a bookmark down on it.  The day would come when I was sort of in the area and would pay a visit.  A truly fabulous meal consisting of teriyaki chicken, Kalua pork, rice, and awesome mac.  I knew I would be back.  Days and months would pass when me and my buddy who had partaken in the previous experience would speak of how we needed to return.  That day would be today (01/25/17), when we would take the mild journey across part of the valley to visit again.  Rolling in well after the lunch hour rush, I took a look at the menu over hanging the many trays of goodness.  This time around, I was processed carb and relatively sugar free.  No rice (PISS) and no mac (DOUBLE PISS) this time around.  Is there sugar in teriyaki?  I was gonna be in denial about that one.  So I ordered up the mighty \"Ono'est.\"  This heart warmer consists of 3 meats and 2 sides.  I went with teriyaki steak, teriyaki chicken, some spicy poke, no rice and a double order of kimchee slaw.  The nice lady compensated me for the lack of rice with extra salad.  Mahalo ma'am, Mahalo!    Given that this is an order...and placed in a wonderful circular, tin tray as you order, my meal was ready to go at cash out.  Me with the meats and four pounds of kimchee slaw.  Everything was divine sans the cold teriyaki chicken.  I was not gonna make a stink, and so I shredded and added it to the good fun kimchee slaw.  I truly missed rice and mac...I really did. Brok' da mout...again.  See you on my next cheat day Makai!  Aloha!!",

Add some brown rice and mac salad and/or corn and, voila, a fabulous meal with all the ono food groups that Makai is great at providing. The staff shares the aloha spirit with you the whole time and the price is right for what you get.  I don't think I've ever ordered anything larger than the medium (Ono'er) which gives you two choices of protein and two sides, but that's enough for me and it's only $7.59 (there's an upcharge if you get Premium Meats like steak and poke, which I haven't). The only down side for us is that it's so far away from our house.  If you're in the area, stop by and try Makai!",

    "text": "All Good!! It's all good here at Makai.  All of my experiences at Makai have been really good ones.  This is fast Hawaiian food at its finest.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).    The pricing is as good as it gets and I dare you to find another restaurant that sells quality Hawaiian food that even comes close.  The Ono, which is their small, is $4.99 and comes with your choice of one meat, rice, and a side.  The Ono'er, which is their medium, is $6.99 and comes with 2 meats, rice, and 2 sides.  The best value is their The Ono'est, which is their large, is $8.49 and comes with 3 meat sources, rice, and 2 sides.  Steak is an extra buck and the poke depends on their current market price.  I had their bowls and love the teri chicken.  I also like the fact that you can also order a la carte.  My most recent order was a side of 5 oz. steak and a 1/2 lb. Spicy Ahi Poke.  Both were great and at that price, a steal.  Overall, I do recommend and wish a place like Makai would open all over Las Vegas.    2017 Yelp Review #41",

    "text": "GRINDZ, BRAH! Amazing hawaiian food fix with perfect portions! Choose your portion set up, choose your base (white or brown rice), choose your business (CHICKEN - teriyaki, pulehu, katsu, mochiko wings; PORK - kalua pig; STEAK - teriyaki or pulehu; AHI TUNA - regular poke, spicy poke) and choose your sides (garlic edamame, macaroni salad, sweet corn, tossed salad, kimchee slaw).   We both ordered the ONO'EST (we were starving!) -- which came with 3 servings of meat, 2 sides and a base... and also chose almost the same exact options:  FOR HER:  - white rice - chicken katsu - regular poke  - teriyaki steak - double mac salad FOR HIM: - brown rice - chicken katsu - spicy poke - pulehu steak - double make salad  Everything was extremely satisfactory. We both agreed the teriyaki steak was better than the pulehu (a tad bland -- he ended up dipping it into the teriyaki sauce), and that the spicy mayo based poke was better than the regular. But again, left satisfied & full, and we will definitely be returning!   COMPLAINT: Why did a drop a star from my rating? My only qualm was it was not exactly a pleasant dining experience customer service wise. I can't help but state that every single employee seemed not only extremely unhappy, but never cracked a single smile and even answered every question with annoyance! I asked the guy what steak he preferred between the teriyaki and the pulehu, and all he did was open both lids and look at me blankly, clearly annoyed. The girl who rang us up kept glaring at me and even ignored me at times when she was ringing me up.   It's just such a waste... such delicious food with horrible customer service. :P",

Both are tasty and the portions are BIG! You also get to choose two sides including mac salad, kim chee, and edamame.   I've also gotten spicy ahi poke and it's not bad at all. One of the better ones I've tried in Vegas. Nothing will ever come close to poke back home in Hawaii, but this certainly hits the spot when I get the hankering for some local food!",

I also got the mochiko chicken wings. Also very good, but not in the same league as the Katsu.   Got mac salad and garlic edamame for my sides. The garlic edamame is served cold but I think it would be way better served hot. Served cold it just doesn't work for me.  Wished I had ordered double mac salad because that was the money side. Not the best I ever had, like on the Big Island, but better than Q&Q or other places with Hawaiian items on their menus.   Beverage situation includes some canned tropical selections and a self serve Coca Cola dispenser. The Coke machine features Strawberry Fanta. Don't see that every day.   Mikey C says: did I mention how crispy the Katsu is?  I did?  Ok then.",

They use panko for the breading and it is just perfect. The chicken inside is flavorful and well cooked. The crust is the divine! It's always light and crispy. Very well done chicken katsu.   They serve it on a bed of rice with your pick of sides. I always like getting the garlic edamame for one of them. It's the perfect kind of salty to pair with rice. I tried their wings once which were all right. I personally prefer the chicken katsu waaaay more. I promise you can't go wrong with it.  The service is decent, the lobby is always clean and well kept. They have a fair number of seats and tables of you prefer dining in. Their sauces are accessible and plenty.

They are making full pieces of chicken breasts and slicing it to order. The breading was crispy and the chicken was moist and delicious (oh yeah, I said moist *wink wink*). Kailua pig was also tender and very tasty. What can be said about macaroni salad and corn? Get out, they didn't mess it up.  Service was quick, the price is hard to beat.

    "text": "I'm in love with this perfect lunch spot. They have everything I like about a quick Hawaiian style lunch. I typically go for kalua pig and Hawaiian style poke with corn and mac salad on the side, plus a can of Hawaiian Sun (though every single time I've been here the juice doesn't seem to be refrigerated well).  It's a simple menu: you choose the size (1, 2, or 3 meats), choice of meat(s), white or brown rice (2 scoops), and side(s). The meats all taste ono. The kalua pig (which is hard to find that tastes good out here) is tender and moist. The chicken and steak taste like home. Poke is also good; although most of the time, the Hawaiian style poke runs out and they only have the California style left (which is mehhh). You get all of this for a decent price.  Only thing I dislike is the rice. It's too hard. I don't know if it is undercooked, or if it's the type of rice they use, but I like my rice sticky and moist in my Hawaiian dishes. Also, maybe it's just this one occurrence, but there was a funky tang to the kimchee. For the sides, I recommend simple sweet corn, garlic edamame, and mac salad.  EDIT: They seem to have upped their rice game. It's consistently been much more moist.",

    "text": "I love the casual concept of order your food and pick what you want, watch it be assembled then pay.   I highly suggest waiting for meat to come off the grill or looking to see if the containers are full with meat. I sampled chicken pelehu which looked amazing in Yelp pics but it was SO dry. :( teriyaki chicken was fresh off the grill and what a difference! It was moist and delicious.   Unfortunately the amount of meat given was very small portion. I wanted more meat it was so good. I liked how it's not smothered in teriyaki sauce but if you compare the portion to what you get at Island Flavor and the price you get 1/3 -1/4 the amount of meat.   I also tried a steak which was dry and another which wasn't. The one that wasn't was really good and not overlooked.  Loved the almonds on the salad yummm but would have been nice if the worker knew the answer to my question about the dressing being homemade. She did not know which she should.   On to the poke...lovvvvvvedddd it! Both flavors were good. The portion is tiny and there is an up charge. The person assembling your food determines how much you get. Mine was above the top of the small cup and my husbands was below the top of the cup line. I don't like that inconsistency. We saw someone near us whose cup was overflowing with poke. Would be great if it's the same amount each time. For the price the portion is comparable I think and it is probably a normal portion size, just now what you expect when you think Hawaiian.   My husband's mochiko chicken has a great flavor.   We were not given napkins and I don't think others were either. I saw people having to go up and ask for napkins. No napkins on tables and no napkins near the soda machine. Put out some napkins, people need it. I kid you not I saw a man blow his nose in his shirt. It was gross. It's an easy fix so I hope management can do that.   I think the flavors are good but with dry chicken and steak it is really not reliable to get a good meal. I wish they just grilled to order somehow.",

    "text": "Yum! To preface, I've started to watch Hawaii Five-O (the remake) on Netflix and it's made me miss Hawaiian food. After a gym session (with a trainer who is Hawaiian), my husband and I were doing Yelp searches since we aren't sure of what to eat for dinner and up pops amazing reviews and photos of this place. I struggled with going to a healthier place but said, \"screw it, I want good food right now\", and we made our way over here. Ordering is Chipotle-esque, which reminded me of Braddah's, but I do think the food here is better than Braddah's because I immediately wanted to go back (went back after 2 days). In comparison, I haven't wanted to go back to Braddah's since I first went even though it's a close option for me.   So what to get? Depends on what you like. Both brown rice and white rice are available (brown rice is 50 cents extra). I really like their flavorful and tender kalua pork and pulehu chicken. Mac salad has macaroni and bits of potato and is perfectly creamy. My husband is a big fan of the mochiko chicken wings; I haven't even gotten a bite in of them yet because he gobbles them up. I tried their toss salad as a side - they include candied almonds and I got the creamy sesame dressing. It's very simple but packs a lot of flavor that pairs well with the rest of your food. Portions are very generous and prices are amazing. To get so much food for under $20 bucks for two people is ridiculous. I even saw some big guys unable to finish up their plates. They have a variety of sauces on the side, but be warned, the to go cups to place the sauces in are a bit flimsy (a few bursted on me on my short drive home), so if you're taking to go, I think it's best to just put the sauce on your food directly before you head out or place them inside your plate within the cup. There was a substantial line for lunch today, which made me very excited, because I hope this place does well. The owners I have met are very kind and their staff seems happy to work there and be part of what they're doing.",

White or brown rice. Meats, sides & you're done! The pulehu steak is my favorite, although the taste and texture is not always consistent. I've had it tender and cut medium sized and I've also had it tough and cut so small it's almost considered \"chopped\" steak. Chicken katsu is always fried perfectly. I also love their sesame dressing on the tossed salad. Definitely try the spicy teriyaki sauce and let your meal swim in it; it is that good.  Watch out if you're here for dinner. Once they're out of poke, they're out, that's it! So come here earlier to make sure you get it.",

I chose the medium:  Base: white rice 2 Meat choices: Mochiko wings & teriyaki steak ($1 upcharge for steak) 2 sides: mac salad & garlic edamame  Only 3 wings came with the 2 meat combo, which I thought was disappointing, but thats all I really needed to be eating anyway...great flavor with the teri steak, the mac salad had potatoes in it, which I love, and the garlic edamame was super garlicky!! Poke wouldve been $1.25 upcharge, but they were out.  I'll go back again, just hope they have poke next time....and napkins!

When I asked if I can add the poke as well, he said I would have to remove one of my other items. I don't understand why I couldn't get the Ono'est, which was a choice of 3 items, but whatever. I ended up buying a 1/2 lb of the poke instead and they ran out of the seared poke.  The chicken was tasty and so was the steak, but the temperature on the steak was just warm and it got cold fast. The rice was a little hard, so I didn't eat too much of it. The garlic edamame had a good flavor, but I think it needed to be cooked just a little longer. The poke was good, but I heard the seared poke was better. I just wish they made some.   I really wanted to like this place because it's local. I may go back and give it another try. We'll see.",

The chicken and steak were good, but the Poke was out of this world. Bright red ahi marinated in heaven! They have two types... A more traditional style poke and then a California roll style poke with a seared ahi and cucumber. The kids liked the Katsu (breaded) chicken. The Mac salad was good, and the Kimchi slaw was great! The owner brought over some crispy chicken wings to sample and I was a little sad we didn't get an order of those. Next time :)  Pricing was very afordable. We ate till we were full for under $20. I'm impressed at the price tag for the quality of food.   The restaurant was clean and fresh. It was kid friendly but also business lunch friendly.   We'll be back for sure.",

My son had the chicken katsu, my husband had the poke, and I had the mochiko chicken wings.  The wings are a MUST try!!  The katsu and poke were delicious as well.. The menu isn't like an L&L BBQ, but it's similar.  Overall, the family and I loved the food, especially the wings.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  My only complaint would be the white rice.  I think it was cooked with just a tad too much water, which of course is an easy fix.  The people working there seemed extremely friendly with that \"aloha spirit\".  There's plenty of parking and best off all; they're right next to Sweet Addiction if you're craving ice cream for dessert.",

That being said, Makai Pacific Island Grill is AWESOME!   I decided to let them choose what I should try for my first time here. I had pulehu steak, teriyaki chicken, and poke. For sides, I chose macaroni salad and kimchee slaw. Everything I got was better than expected. My girlfriend got mochiko wings and chicken katsu. She thought it was very good as well. She liked the mochiko wings the best.   The establishment itself is very clean and the usual Hawaiian music always welcoming. The staff is friendly and helpful.

It was a pretty busy night upon walking in and we already knew what we were having.   I went with the Ono'er (Medium - 2 choice meat, 2 sides & rice) with Pulehu Steak $1.00 additional and Teri Chicken, mac salad and kim chee slaw. And the Ono (Small - 1 choice meat, 2 side & rice) with Kalua Pig and corn. My little favorite!!!!  The pulehu steak was chopped up way too small and was not hot. And my mac salad was also not cold enough. I don't remember the steak being chopped that small the last time i had it but it almost was like I was a baby eating baby food. I get the portion control but it needs to be sliced or chopped bigger in my opinion especially for the extra cost you're  paying.  We will be back again hoping or next experience is a little better like how I remembered it!",

Knowing I wouldn't be back for awhile, I decided to go ahead and go balls to the wall and order the large. The large is composed of 3 meats and 2 sides. Heads up: the poke, steak, and brown rice is extra, but believe me when I say the spicy poke is absolutely worth paying extra. I'll get into more details in a bit.  I ordered the kalua pig which is a shredded pork, the spicy poke, and chicken katsu. So, back to the poke I was talking about earlier! If you're a fan of spicy, it has a nice little bite to it. The poke bits were nice and chunky too. It's absolutely worth paying extra for!  The kalua pig was thankfully moist thanks to the natural fattiness of pork and the seasoning was just right. I'm not a katsu fan, but I got it anyway. It was good, but I'd imagine it would be pretty damn good to someone who actually orders katsu regularly.  As far as servings go, they don't hold back here. The medium probably would have sufficed, but as I mentioned earlier, I wanted to go all out.  I didn't catch the guy's name that helped us, but he was funny and overall a cool guy.  Next time in Vegas and if our journey permits, I'll probably swing by, especially if I'm looking to load up on food and save my leftovers for dinner.",

I have to say I never rushed here because I just couldn't imagine it being that good. I was pleasantly surprised!  Makai serves Hawaiian plate lunches in a non traditional way. They have you choose white or brown rice THEN you add proteins! They have a lot of classics and then they have some special items that make the cost go up like poke and mochiko wings.  The food was all really good. I enjoyed everything. My recommendations would be their poke and their garlic edamame. The classics are done well and really hit the spot like the chicken katsu and the kalua pig.  My one gripe was the noticeable portioning. Hey man I'm all about food costs and making a living, but the first visit I had one of the servers take some food out of my tray because the portion was too much I suppose? Come on guys! Be a little slick!   Overall I support local businesses and I'll definitely be back. The food hits the spot and it gives you a variety instead of ordering a huge serving of only one entree.",

It's just around the corner from me so I would come for Hawaiian food cravings or to grab lunch on the way to work. For the price and the portion, factoring in the quality, it's a littler more pricey in comparison to other Hawaiian restaurants nearby but still come to Makai cause it's closer. Today though, this is the worse I've ever experienced this place!! Lots of people in line as usual and it's my turn. I get the medium combo with katsu and teriyaki beef. This girl literally picks 3 already cut pieces to put on my plate and that was it. THREE!!! I don't know if she factored in the weight of my rice with that katsu but 3 pcs seems ridiculous when you're paying $10 for a plate. So not wanting to cause delay for others I move on to the sides hoping that that person would notice how much katsu I was given. Got double sweet corn. He must have noticed cause he piled on so much corn on that plate I've ever seen instead of fixing the problem. But SERIOUSLY is this how it is here now? Cause if so, I'm not coming back. It's ridiculous to pay that much for 3 pieces of meat and 2 big scoops of rice. Had I gotten a small or a bowl, I'd just be eating rice. You guys have to fix this!!",

There's a small which you can choose one protein & one side. I usually get the medium which has two protein and two sides. They also have a large which has 3 protein with two sides. All come with white rice (brown rice has an extra fee).   They also have Poke for extra fee.  I love this place especially after the gym.",

It's the perfect build-your-own plate lunch that is assembled in a jiffy via Chipotle-style lunch line.  Pick 1, 2, or 3 proteins (upcharges for stuff like poke or steak, but it's totally worth it).  Pick your sides. As always, you gotta get mac salad. I always like corn here, too, for some reason.  Sit down almost immediately and feed your inner monster. It's hard not to shovel your food into your mouth; it's so good! Satisfying and not too sweet. Parking is a no brainer in this shopping center, so easy in and easy out!",

The Katsu was dry, the kimchi coleslaw was really salty, and the macaroni salad was missing something because it tasted just like mayonnaise. If you do visit try the spicy sauce located near the soda machines bc it adds a kick to the plates they offer.   Would I come back? Probably not. I feel like you're well more rounded at L&L.",

    "text": "I was trying to go to magic noodles next door but it was temporarily closed so I noticed makagrill was next door and it had good reviews so I decided to go in. The prices are fairly cheap for what they give you but for any beef options you have to pay extra so your basically left with chicken only if you don't want to pay extra, chicken katsu or teriyaki chicken etc. The other meat options were $1.50 more. The portions we're decent size. So you get two types of meats, two sides and two large scoops of rice for like $8 with bottle water which is fairly cheap.   The sesame dressing was dam good. It was for the salad but I used it to dip the chicken katsu and it was better than the katsu sauce. I would have given them another star but the service seem a bit shotty. The restaurant was run basically by high school kids. When I went in Friday evening. They had run out of all poke I guess that is understandable since it was an hour before closing. The girl who was ringing me up asked me what salad dressing I wanted and I didn't know what they had she rattled off so fast that all I heard was sesame and that's what I took.   She needs a lesson in service, not all customers who come in are regulars and know what salad dressing they have and she needs to slow down instead of just rattling off like I'm bugging her. It wasn't like the place was busy I was the only one ordering at the time. Also it was my first time and they could have asked me if I have been there before and if I needed any help ordering. Even tho it's basically self explanatory if you read the menu board. It's all about how you treat your customer that have you keep coming back.",

I like the kalua pig and spicy poke together, and that kimchi coleslaw is incredible! Tried the steak also, which was seasoned perfectly. Bonus: they offer a military discount, which is so greatly appreciated. Phenomenal.

If you're from Hawaii, you definitely wanna try this place out! To also add their price point is ON POINT.  You get the best bang for your buck and they give you SOO MUCH food. They have a whole sauce station to get all your desired sauces. They have some Hawaiian juices if you wanted some lilikoi drink or whatnot. The atmosphere is super nice in there too, if you don't want to sit inside there's outdoor seats too!  My favorite plate to order here HAS to be the kalua pork, so Ono, literally the BEST kalua and they offer you brown or white rice. They also offer you salads if you're more of the vegetarian side. What's even more awesome is they offer kimchi slaw as a side too!!! Like whaaaaaaattttt   You can also order the poke on the side, half lb or full lb to take home.  If I could Id eat here every meal the pricing is so good, the service is good, the sauces are good, the cleanliness is good. 5 stars!!!!  I'll definitely recommend (well I've already did lol) and I'll definitely come back",

She said it reminded her of Chipotle in a sense of choosing what you want and they just put it in those plasticy-metal..(?) containers. It's pretty self-explanatory.. Choose your \"size\" (example: I got a 'medium', 2 meats and 2 sides). I read from past reviews they run out of poke sometimes, and thankfully they didn't run out of either spicy or regular poke from when I ordered. Maybe I got lucky!  Shoutout to 'Joe M.' for the help and suggestions. I'm definitely coming back.. They have many options from both meats and sides, and they also sell poke by how much, 1/4 lb, 1/2 lb, etc. Bomb dot com!",

    "text": "TLDR: Chipotle-style ordering; Americanized flavors; quick service; minimal options   After passing by this location on several Sundays, I decided to make a special trip with my friend when they were actually open. To my surprise, it wasn't a full service restaurant, but that's ok because it just meant we were going to get our food faster.   You place the order at the front service counter depending on the number of meats and sides to order. The availability of proteins were limited. I opted for the tuna poke, Mac salad, and white rice. They offered a regular Hawaiian-style and a spicy version. When I asked the serve the difference, he rudely stated \"Well the spicy has mayo and sriracha. Does that help?\" No it doesn't snatch because I've never been here before and I want to know the other sauces. If you're tired of explaining the differences, then make a sign. Either way, I opted for the spicy version. The other server weighs the exact amount of poke for the $1.25 upcharge.   I left hungry and unsatisfied. The poke was of poor quality. The mac salad containing potato bits was flavorless and left much to be desired. I question the amount of fellow Islanders in line as the food and service wasn't even worth the trip. Their teri sauce was super oily and the total food portions were very small. Definitely an Americanized version overall or maybe just a bad batch of foods. The 4.5 star rating is very confusing and I wonder if the reviewers have ever had True Hawaiian food.   Needless to say, I won't be coming back to visit anytime soon. A serious change would have to occur in order to earn my business. (Not even a yelp check-in offer would entice me to visit in the near future.)",

    "text": "Great place to get a big meal for good value. I typically get a Medium (rice, 2 meat, 2 sides) with white rice, katsu, mochiko wings, and double garlic edamame. It's a lot of food and I can rarely finish the whole thing in one sitting unless I'm really hungry. If you order katsu, they cut it right in front of you before they add it to your plate. Don't forget to grab some Katsu sauce before you eat! I personally don't eat Poke, but when I eat at Makai with friends, they rave about how good the Hawaiian style Poke is. They order it every time we come, so it must be pretty darn good.   Their system is similar to Chipotle/Subway where you go down a line, tell someone what to put in your order and so on until you reach the register to pay. Sometimes the line gets pretty slow and it seems like they run out of stuff often, then you have to wait a bit for a new batch. Maybe I'm a little unlucky, but they never seem to have mochiko wings when I come in, so I end up having to get double katsu more often than not. I'd recommend coming well before closing time to ensure that they'll have the meats you want. I typically take my order to go, but there's plenty of tables if you choose to eat in. Still though, Makai is a good option to fill any cravings for Hawaiian food.",

Pilao!  No offense to you franchisees, but who behind the line am I gonna run Pidgin English by?  I want the food...but I also want the friendly banter!  Luckily, Makai Pacific Island Grill owned and run by genuine kine locals!  Da kine dat understand da Pidgin!  Good for me, not so good for mainlander folks like the wifey.  Oh well, it's okay bebe, let me do the talking!  This place is pretty far for us to drive to but on a Friday night we decided to make the little trek on down to the SW side of Vegas.  I think it was a little after 8 PM so it wasn't very busy, maybe only 2 or 3 other tables occupied.  That gave us a lot of time to look at the menu boards and talk with one of the owners behind the counter.  Pidgin accent do I detect?  Oh yeah, howzit brah!?  \"Oh yeah, you from Oahu?  Yeah, yeah I from Maui...\" and so on, and so on.  Within a 5 minute conversation I was able to easily navigate through Makai's menu.  Very similar in style to Chipotle as well as another local-run joint Braddah's.  Except instead of stuffing it into a burrito or a taco, you get a fancy foil bowl.  A taste of Hawaii, all in one!   First you choose your SIZE of bowl: *Ono (small) $4.99 - 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base *Ono'er (medium) $6.99 - 2 meat, 2 side, 1 base *Ono'est (large) $8.49 - 3 meat, 2 side, 1 base *Bowl $5.99 - 2 meat, 1 base *Salad $7.99 - 2 meat  Then you choose your base: *White rice *Brown rice (extra)  Then you choose your business (meat): *Chicken - Teri, Pulehu, Katsu, or Mochiko Wings *Pork - Kalua *Steak - Teri or Pulehu (extra) *Ahi Tuna! - Poke or Seared Poke (extra)  Then you pick a side: *Garlic Edamame *Corn *Grilled Veggies *Mac Salad *Toss Salad *Kimchee Slaw  Things on the line were dwindling that night so I asked if for our order they could cook us up fresh, not a problem!  Hot and tasty stuff from the grill.  We ordered:  -Ono'er bowl with rice, chicken katsu, teri steak, mac salad & kimchee slaw -Ono'er bowl with rice, kalua pork, pulehu steak, double mac salad -Salad with kalua pork, pulehu steak & creamy sesame dressing  Food was ONO!  Grilled items great with the papa'a (burnt) edges just like I like it.  Flavor was good and the katsu was moist & crunchy.  Mac salad was cold & simple the way it should be, kimchee slaw was a nice surprise!  Not too spicy.  Rice was actually cooked CORRECTLY!Wifey & kid liked their bowls as well, we pretty much sopped it all up!    Don't forget the secrets here - shoyu & furikake on the rice (ask at the counter), shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco on the mac salad, Da Katsu Sauce on da katsu!  Sauces are clearly labeled at Makai!  OK, only reason Makai didn't get a 5-star?  They ran out of POKE!  NOOOOO!  Locals in the know, know that hot rice & cold poke make a person happy.  Next time Makai, make sure get poke for last all day long!    Another plus for Makai though, they serve Coca-Cola products!  Plus for me anyway.  Makai Grill, I will be back brah...but make sure, bettah make sure, get nuff' poke for when I come around!    MAHALOS!",

    "text": "It's a Friday evening and Flaming Fajitas was on fire with the wait. I've had this marked so twas the best time to do it since we were already on this part of town. There were a few people in the building enough to make you think, wow...these folks definitely got business.   Service was mediocre. Nothing welcoming nor unwelcoming. Just a bunch of folks standing behind the counter doing their job. No prob, though. I was just excited to try somewhere new.  We ordered a bowl (2 proteins and 2 scoops of rice) of chicken katsu and spicy ahi, 1 Ono (1 protein, 1 scoop of rice, and 1 side) with the chicken teriyaki, 1 Ono'er (2 proteins, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides) with spicy ahi and mochiko chicken, and an extra order of garlic edamame on the side. All our sides we opted for garlic edamame and 1 of their sweet corn.  I love the concept of this place! From choosing your protein to your sides. I love garlic edamame so honestly, being able to have this option on my plate was seriously the need for me to try this spot out.   But to be honest, the food was jusssst alright. I had 4 pcs of mochiko chicken wings that were the tiny kine chicken wings. By the time I finished the wings, which didn't take long at all, I still couldn't figure out if the mochiko chicken was legit. I think the flavor almost had me by the 4th one, but I feel as tiny as those wings are...they should increase the serving. Not to mention the chicken was pretty dry and chewy. Clearly been sitting for abit. The spicy ahi was pretty decent as well. It tasted super fishy, though. Which may sound funny to many out there, but fish shouldnt taste l...\"fishy\". My husband enjoyed it. I liked it...but not a fan of fish tasting like fish if you know what I mean.  The sweet corn kind of reminded me of canned corn. I was hoping to feel excited off the corn, but I wasnt. That got abandoned.   My son had a couple strands of hair in his serving of poke, which they gladly replaced. Same batch of poke, just no scoop of hair in this one. The young lady running the register did apologize. My son didn't really like his poke because he got a lot of the peices that were the chewier cuts. The chicken katsu is made with chicken thighs. You get 1 thigh cut into voila, katsu status. Overall, the son agrees that everything on his plate was jusssst alright. I could tell he wasn't excited about it because he didn't kill his plate as he normally would if something was on point. The kid is only 8, but he's a beast when it comes to his food and he has impressive tastebuds. His opinion matters. Lol.  The other son had the chicken teriyaki. I mean, chicken teriyaki is pretty basic. I believe the chicken teriyaki is chicken thighs as well just cut into peices. The Ono was a perfect serving for my 6 year old, who didn't even finish it. Not because he didn't like it, but because he's the polar.opposite of his big brother. He, too, is an edamame lover so he def killed that.  Overall, we spent about $26 for our meal. The dining room was filled and folks were still coming in. I started feeling bad for those who got their food, then had to do the grueling search for an open seat you know has yet to exist.   I would recommend someone in the area to give it a shot or anyone who just wants a different hawaiian eating experience. We probably wouldn't make such a drive specifically for this place being that it's across town. Nothing wowed or had my tastebuds on its knees for more. The first experience just didn't go too swell.  Definitely kid friendly and you could get away with bringing a stroller in here as well.  Enjoy!",

The guys behind the glass are so kind, I came in a group of 3 and one of them wasn't really hungry but they insisted he eat. It was that Hawaiian culture that nobody sits and doesn't eat. I really enjoy the teriyaki chicken here, as they mentioned it was the top seller.  I always go for the Ono (small) plate, it comes with brown rice or white rice, just keep in mind that the brown rice is an additional $.60 charge. The proteins available are teriyaki chicken, kahlua pig, chicken wings or you can pay the extra $1 for the ahi or steak.   The mac salad on the side is also my favorite mac salad of any Hawaiian spot in the valley. Something about it here tastes extra fresh and there's that love put into the recipe that I really admire also!  I was in the area and wanted to get something yummy to eat and I knew this wouldn't disappoint.",

I had to try all my favorites: Kaula pig, teriyaki steak and teriyaki chicken were my meat choices. For the sides I went with Mac salad and Kim Chee slaw. Prices are good and portions are even better. Let's get down to the food.. The max salad is probably the best Hawaiian Mac salad I've had out here. The kitchen slaw was a first for me and very good with a nice amount of spice. The Kaula pig was a little bland but juicy and tender. I think places out here are afraid to salt the pig... Just salt the pig! Lol. Chicken and steak were very good. I think I found my new spot and it's close to home. Onolecious!",

I stopped in and ordered the Ono'er(medium) $6.99 with kalua pork, spicy poke ($1.25 upcharge), macaroni salad, & garlic edamame with a white rice base. The spicy poke and the macaroni salad are outstanding! Both of these are worth the trip here alone. The pork and the edamame are really good. I would definitely order them again but may switch them out next time to keep trying their menu. The service was prompt and friendly. You get a great value for the price. This place will definitely become a regular spot for me.",

I've been here a few times now, and I can't say that I love it or hate it. Their price point isn't bad, but for about the same price you could go somewhere else where your food is made to order. Now I understand this is where the fast and convenience factor comes in to play. As far as the food, it's ok. The Kalua Pig was nice and tender, but the Chicken Katsu was a little dry. The steak was a bit tough, and not tender enough. As for the service, it's always fast and friendly. I really enjoy coming here for a quick bite or grabbing it to go, but there are better Hawaiian options in town",

Not only is the poke amazing but the way its setup so you can try a little of everything is what I loved! It brings me back to when I was in Hawaii. I could come back here once a week for my poke craving and have some chicken katsu as well! They are always busy when I go in, so you know its a great spot!",

They cooked up fresh Katsu so I didn't have to eat one that had been sitting there. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The employees are super friendly. They felt bad for making us wait an extra 10minutes (even though we didn't say anything, or mind), and gave us an extra cutlet on the house. The pulehu steak was a little chewy but was flavorful nonetheless. My husband loved their corn and salad dressing.  I just wished they had one in SoCal. I'd be there all the time.  Loved that they were blastin J Boog.",

I thought I would give them another try, this was the first time I've been back in over a year and the chicken is still being overcooked to death and they are now weighting the plates with food scales as they add the proteins. After all said and done I got about 4-5 pieces of Katsu and 6 small, sad pieces of overcooked Teri chicken.   I was still hungry after I left since I had to throw away most of the teriyaki chicken.

The prices are also reasonable. I like that I have the option of getting a meal for $5, you choose a protein, side and get rice or salad. Although I typically do the 3 meats (chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, and ahi poke) because I like having leftovers.   I love the Ahi poke, it's always fresh and delicious. But my favorite is the chicken Katsu... it's so crispy and always fresh. The teriyaki chicken is hit or miss. Sometimes it's a bit to charred and dry for my liking, but I usually take my chances and get it anyway. The kimchi slaw is okay, it lacks flavor and leaves much to be desired. I do like the fresh taste of it but wish they seasoned it a bit better. The Mac salad is so good I could eat a pound of it! Overall I like Makai for fresh and tasty Hawaiian food.",

However, the last time a worker was extremely rude but I let it go, thinking it was just a one time issue. After this time, I will not be coming back ever. All od the workers seemed to be new because absolutely nobody knew what they were doing and put like 3 small pieces of meat on the plate ?? I had to ask for everything 3 times before they gave me what I wanted and kept confusing my plate with another persons and put the wrong side on it. I told them it was the wrong one and the person just stared at me like they didn't know what to do. I literally had to ask them if they could change it. Service here used to be great and they were never cheap with the food they put on your plate. Now, they literally put three small pieces of meat and charge you $23. Never again.",

My favorite protein is the chicken, which is grilled perfectly every time, making it tender and juicy...mmmm... I am getting hungry just thinking about it! I like to pair my chicken with brown rice - it costs a little extra but it is worth it because it is sticky rice and so delicious. I also like to get kim chee slaw and a side salad with a sesame dressing that is YUMMY. Like, seriously drinkable because it is so good.

When I showed up 15 min later the guy that says he's the owners cousin or brother or whatever named victor said \"I put on the app 30min so he can wait 30 min!\" What? There were 5 people in line!!! It's not even busy. I'm sitting here watching as he's taking  more and more people that came in after my order. Finally, victor left the serving line and the new person realized what was going on and made my order right away. I hope that guy victor isn't related to the owner because he's an ass.",

We didn't know what pulehu steak was so we asked for a sample and found it to be quite tasty and very tender.   We should have suspected something was going to be off when the server had to scrape the last of the steak into our tin.  What we ended up with was the overcooked, medium well pieces at the bottom that were tough.  When we brought it to the cashier's attention, he didn't care.  \"I'll let the chef know.\" was his response.    We liked everything else and the sides were good.

Also, the seared ahi is made to order so don't expect to get it right away.   The teri chicken had some flavor but I got the bottom of the pan, so unfortunately I wasn't a fan.

    "text": "Really excited to try Makai, usually go to Island Style or Island Flavor, this place is closer. Ordered the classic and most popular Hawaiian dishes: Teri chicken & kalua pig w2 sides. Mac salad & I haven't seen corn on a Hawaiian menu tho I do love sweet corn roasted on the Cobb and Mexican style off the Cobb too, they served it off the Cobb. Also had white rice. The good first: rice cooked perfect. Kalua pig had the right amount of Smokey flavor not too salty or overly smoked but didn't have any crispy grilled pieces, just soft and very moist. Regular and spicy Teri sauce didn't really differ in taste but the Teri flavor was good either way. Now what could improve: the Teri chicken seemed like it was originally cooked great but it is cut into small pieces and put into a warming pan like at a cafeteria, unfortunately it dries the meat out and the outside becomes too chewy. There were some moist pieces tho overall not as good as could be. Mac salad flavor was similar to what you'd order at l&l bbq which I would say is exactly how it should be made (more mayo could have been used). The corn was simple and good. Lastly, what should be reviewed and Re-done: the Ahi Poke!!!! I've caught my own, I've ordered it from many places, tho here I noticed half was stored in a container and \"topped off\" with more from the cold pan that you choose from. Haven't seen that method before which is fine but the issue was the quality of the poke. Very grainy and flavorless, I can't say i know if it is wild caught or farmed but I know that the flavor and texture was not as expected. The \"spice\" wasn't really apparent either just like the Teri sauce. This would be the only item I had that I wouldn't recommend if this is how it is always. For dessert they serve three flavors of cup ice cream though the spoons need to be changed or you just need to wait 8-10 minutes for your icecream to soften to eat it, the spoons are too flimsy.",

    "text": "I was really hoping to give this spot a five star review, but my heart and my tastebuds were telling me otherwise. I came here for the first time with my family last weekend because we were all craving a little taste of home. I've heard nothing but good things about Makai Pacific Island Grill, so I suggested it and that's how we ended up here.  I really liked the concept of Makai. It's almost like Chipotle in a sense because you get to choose and build your plate as you walk down the line, but with Hawaiian flavors instead. You choose what size plate you want, and from there you pick your base, meats, and sides. The Ono'er (Medium) was definitely enough for me. I went with the brown rice, Kalua pig, spicy ahi poke, mac salad, and sweet corn. Keep in mind that the premium meats are extra, which isn't a big deal at all. The teriyaki steak and Pulehu steak are both $1 extra and the Hawaiian poke and spicy ahi poke are both $1.25 extra. My sister also went with the Ono'er option and chose the teriyaki chicken. While ordering, she noticed that the teriyaki chicken was almost out and decided to wait for the fresh batch that would be coming off of the grill in a few minutes. Meanwhile, we paid and took the rest of our order to the table that we were lucky enough to snag!  My food was just okay. For starters, the Kalua pig here just wasn't appealing to me, which is really unfortunate because Kalua pig is one of my favorite local dishes. It didn't look appetizing on my plate, but I tried it anyway. The flavor was there, but the meat was way too fatty for my liking. I ate a few bites of it after picking around the fat and then just pushed the rest to the side. The spicy ahi is a different story. It was fresh and soft. It didn't have that fishy taste to it, which I liked. It was cut into perfect bite-sized cubes and it didn't take much effort to chew... You know the poke is good when it just melts in your mouth! The poke did not let me down at all. My sides were nothing spectacular. The mac salad has potatoes in it, which is different, and the sweet corn reminded me of the stuff they take out of the can and serve to you in the cafeteria at school.  Anyways, the other reason I had to give this place three stars is because the teriyaki chicken that my sister patiently waited for was undercooked. She took a bite into one of the pieces and it was rubbery and still a little pink. We brought it to management's attention and they were very apologetic and replaced it without a problem.   Overall, our first experience here wasn't the best and I'm not sure that we'll be driving 35 minutes across town any time soon to give it another go. Hopefully our next visit in the future will be a better one.",

No hi, welcome to Makai was uttered, not even a simple hello. What greeted us was a lifeless what is your order going to be? Ummm ok, awkward.  We decided on 2 Ono'er (medium $6.99) plates, 1 Ono'est (large $8.49) and salad ($7.99). The way they have it set up is you pick your base, sides and protein. Price is standard until your \"upgrades\" and then bam before you know it, your plate is close to $10. I don't really mind paying more if it's worth it but when meat portions are somewhat questionable and taste is sub par then we have a slight problem. My mom's salad was definitely not worth $7.99, there was barely any greens and proteins. I enjoyed my pulehu chicken, great flavors. Spicy poke was just ok as was the mac salad. Edamame needed to be boiled longer, was so hard that I couldn't take out the bean without crushing it. Garlic seasoning was tasty but it was frustrating eating those suckers. The kalua pig was salty and barely had smoky taste and flavor. My husband enjoyed his mochiko wings and said the kimchi slaw was surprisingly good, I wasn't on the same page.  Not in a hurry to go back but will give it another go one of these days. Hopefully the service won't be as chilly and a better experience all around.",

It comes with 2 sides, 2 meats, and your choice of white or brown rice. There are a few extra charges on some things. The brown rice, regular poke, spicy poke, and steak is extra charges.  They give you a good portion on the sides and meats. Everything here is always so good. They never disappoint. One thing that I do want to mention is they make so much poke that you can order ahead of time by calling but you still have to come in to pick it up as soon as possible.",

One of the latest additions is Makai Pacific Island Grill. Any business that makes the Hot New Business list on yelp and close to my house so in!!!   My first stop really wanted to try some of the spicy poke. I went when they first open so told me 10-15miin wait. Ok. I figure get some on my second visit. I went with the Pulehu Steak and Kalua Pig choice of meat. Two sides went mac salad and Kimchee slaw. The kimchee slaw was awesome. I love all things Kimchee. I never had Kimchee slaw. It had nice kick nothing over the top heat but added so much more flavor then regular coleslaw. Mac Salad was solid. The meats the Kalua Pig and the Steak Pulehu both was solid. The Kalua Pig surprise not offer it with cabbage. Still the meat was nice moist and had nice flavor to it. The Steak Pulehu was cooked perfect medium rare. Second visit got me some Spicy Poke. Poke hands down was the WINNAH. Also have Hawaiian style poke but would highly recommend the Spicy Poke more. If you want they offer sample of the Poke can have one bite. Second go around my meats went with teri chicken and spicy poke. The teri chicken was cooked perfect! It had nice char on the outside, hot and moist inside, and not overpowering sauce at all. The spicy Poke was amazing. I read other reviews that hit or miss. They do make it fresh everyday so consistency might be problem. On this day got nothing but amazing amazing and right there was the best straight poke (all they sell POKE like Poke express) spots in town. It was that good decided take half pound action later for dinner. Yay!!!   The concept at Makai Pacific Island Grill is one that think is really cool. Simple, straight forward, very very reasonable, get choke food, and legit local grinds. They offer three different size bowls. The medium size (Ono'er) get two meats and two sides. Just right.  If not fan of white rice they offer brown rice as other base option. They have few options comes to meats and sides. It like ordering half an half at other local restaurants. The POKE that really stands out. Not often see menu that has Poke as meat option. POKE be honest not the cheapest thing on the menu always at market price. No different here and the price per lb changes daily basis. Steal of deal plate lunch with all the sides and Poke. They have four different bottle sauces on the side condiments can add.  The interior is nothing that blow you away. Really simple. The music not sure if local station back home. All hawaiian music that grew up with come the C&K, Hawaiian Style Music, Braddah Iz, and just good island roots.   No doubt Makai is my new quick go to spot comes for local grinds.. POKE the star of the show!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Probably the best Hawaii food I have had in Las Vegas!  Everything was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Its like Chipotle, but Hawaii-food!    Got the ono'est plate with mochico chicken wings, chicken katsu, and hawaiian poke with side garlic edamame & kimchee slaw.  Mochico chicken was a bit on the dryer side, but still very tasty.  The katsu was very moist and crunchy on the outside... So hard to do, but it was perfection.  The edamame was good, and well spiced and not overcooked.  The kimchee slaw was something else!  Its like a normal slaw, but with a kimchee base liquid... So ono!  The teri chicken for the kids was also moist and flavorful, but right on the borderline of too much char for me personally.  And now the best part... The poke!  The hawaiian and the spicy ahi poke was probably the best I have had in vegas.  Fresh, cut right, and without all the stringy parts.  Perfect amount of spice!  Also a decent price (was $13.99/lb).    As a tip, do not order poke as a protein option for your plate.  You pay $1.25 more, for a tiny little cup.  Its totally not enough!  Its probably best to just get a 1/4 pound on the side.  My only two real disappointments with this place... The Samurai Hawaiian Frost cups cooler was wrecked!  Hardly any flavors left!  Also no fruit punch to speak of in the soda dispensers...  Also don't go on Sundays!  They are closed... (Ohana time)  Totally coming back to this place!",

The decor is very simple with no pictures or color.  The table and chairs is just plane and boring.  I don't think I'll be coming back, it's one of those restaurant you try once and THAT'S IT!!",

You know a place is good when it open at 10:30 and you get there at 10:34 and there are already 5 customers sitting and eating in the restaurant.   Kalua Pig was the best thing in my opinion!

They covered most of the options so I couldn't c what they looked like. I ordered the medium plate with pulehu steak(big mistake) and the Hawaiian poke. They had it covered like I mentioned n it didn't look very much like steak when they added to my bowl. Didnt taste much better. My sides were kimchi slaw and sweet corn. My mom was going to order the mochiko chicken but it looked burnt so she changed to teriyaki chicken and the chicken katsu with kimchi slaw n Mac salad. I tried a taste of everything my mom had too n it was ALL good except that pulehu steak. Maybe ask to look before choosing. If the steak looks like the one in my picture pick something else lol",

I would've chosen the poke instead of the chicken, but at the time the chicken looked ono.  It makes you feel like back home playing the island-style music. The people who work there are friendly. Hopefully they last long because they are a good place to eat when I'm on that side of town.",

I picked the medium combo with mochiko chicken wings (extra 0.50) and ahi tuna (extra 1.25).  As we were getting our food scooped, I was thinking oh man they are kind of stingy with their portions....haha.  The medium came with 3 chicken wings and small maybe 1/4 lb or less of ahi tuna, 2 scoops of rice and a 2 side items.  The mochiko wings were surprisingly tasty and juicy.  The ahi tuna was really fresh and well seasoned as well.  For about $10 a plate, the portion is right.  I was full but not stuffed, but I also opted to only eat a small amount of the rice.  The creamy sesame dressing for the tossed salad was really good as well.  The kid's meal is also a good deal and cheaper than most places, a scoop of rice and either kahlua pork or teri chicken as the meat for $3.75.  Great casual Hawaiian restaurant!  We'll definitely be back.",

It's a great spot to grab and go.  I ordered the Ono'er sized meal which comes with 2 servings of meat, 2 scoops of rice, and 2 sides.  I chose the Kalua pig and chicken katsu while my partner chose the spicy poke (+$1.25/serving) and teriyaki chicken.  Also, they have brown rice available as well!  For our sides I chose the kimchi slaw and macaroni salad while my partner chose the garlic edamame and the kimchi slaw as well.  If that sounds like a mouthful, it's because it is!  We couldn't finish everything and had to take it to go because there was just so much food!  And that is just for the medium.    We went when everything was fresh and hot, but I can imagine when it's slow that the food wouldn't be as hot.      One thing I want to mention is that they can also sell poke by itself.  When I went it was $13.99 per pound because of the market value.  I loved their spicy poke and can't wait to try their regular poke!",

    "text": "Saw this place on Instagram and decided to come with a few friends. It's basically a Hawaiian version of chipotle. They have 3 sizes to choose from (Ono, Ono'er, and Ono'est), along with 9 different types of meat, 6 sides, and 2 bases. The area is very clean and the workers are friendly.   It wasn't busy at all when we came in (thank goodness) - but a long line formed as soon as we sat down.   I went with the smallest bowl (Ono) and got the Hawaiian poke (+1.25 per serving) with a tossed salad as the side - it also came with a ball of white rice. It came out to about $6.   I don't know what the hell they put in the poke, but it was delicious...sucks that it was a small amount so I cried a little on the inside. The rice was a bit dry, I'm not sure if it was old rice or that's just how they make it. The salad just pretty plain with romaine, carrots, and some cucumbers - still good though but I could just make that at home.   I would definitely come back to this place to try something else! I prefer it over chipotle any day - too bad it's a bit far from my house.",

As I proudly order the ohn'er, I say I would like the chicken pulehu! And the man says, I'm sorry, but it has been discontinued. The room got dark and the trees started to die around me. I then proceeded to order the teriyaki chicken and the Kalua pig with macaroni salad and sweet corn. The teriyaki chicken was okay. Nothing special from the other places with teriyaki chicken. The chicken was a bit dry, but still edible in its form. The Kalua pig, was too salty for me. I don't eat pork, but I took a few bites and thought it was too salty. I gave the remainder to my BF, which he gladly ate. Overall, nothing wowed me, but it's a great place for cheap and fast food. I'm not sure if I would come here for my Hawaiian food cravings, but if I was hungry and needed something fast. Sadly, the high reviews didn't meet my expectations and fell short for me.",

I checked out their menu on their website and was impressed. They keep it simple and the photos looked Ono (delicious). My two friends and I came in at noon on a Friday and the line was long, but worth it. The team was friendly, took time to explain the offerings, and customer service continued once you sat down. I had the medium and it was a HUGE amount of food. The teriyaki chicken was tasty, the teriyaki steak was so good, the Mac salad was just like my tita makes it in the islands, the kimchee coleslaw was perfection. I highly recommend this place for island style food and will be back again very soon.",

Three stars because their other main dishes arent very good. The chicken katsu tastes strange and rubbery compared to other places probably because they have it laid out under the heat lamp and dont fry it fresh. The teriyaki chicken had good flavor, but tasted undercooked. The pork kalua is ok, but bland and you have to put lots of sauce on it for it to be good. Also they changed their menu so now teriyaki beef is about $1.50 more. The poke is extra but thats understandable. Prices and value are great because you can try different things unlike other places, but wish they had more on their menu. Recommend the macaroni salad and garlic edamame! The regular edamame is too salty.",

    "text": "HOW HAVE I NOT MADE A REVIEW ON THIS PLACE YET???? WHERE DO I BEGIN? So the first time I've been here was over a year ago around the time they first opened since I work at Driven Boutique next door! The first time I ate here was before I became pescatarian so I've tried the teriyaki chicken and the steak and they were SOOO good especially when you get the steak fresh!! (I would request it, does take a bit longer but it's so worth it) But now that I'm pescatarian I'm only able to eat the poke which I'm not complaining about!! My typical order now would be the small with brown rice, w/ either just the Hawaiian poke or I get half and half of the Hawaiian and spicy tuna which is another tip I suggest if you want both, and the green salad with the sesame dressing (YALL THIS IS BOMB DONT SLEEP ON IT) with the candied almonds on top(ALSO OBSESSED WITH THIS ASK FOR IT ON THE TOP OR ON THE SIDE) I always ask for as much almonds as they can give me because it just goes so well with the salad and dressing! The small gets me at a perfect and satisfied full, not too full where I feel bloated but satisfies my hunger! The staff is always so nice and sweet to me! The only complaint I have is that they up charge for brown rice.. I mean it's only 50 cents more but why :( other than that I love this place and eat here multiple times per week! Perfect healthy and satisfying meal! Another tip is, when you come past 8 chances are they are out of poke! Also, I hate that they are closed on Sunday's because sometimes after church I be craving but remember it's close but I like that they give Sunday's off to their employees to have family time which is what Sunday's are all about in my opinion! I love love love this place y'all need to try NOW! Also I've talked with some employees & seems like they're working on opening multiple locations so I can't wait!!!!",

I was gonna go eat Steak at a well known establishment but instead decided to try this new spot out. I have to say I am very happy that I made the choice I did.. it was as they say in Hawaii sooo Ono!!! The staff, which happened to be the owners, which happened to be 3 brothers from Hawaii, where very pleasant. The portion size was just right with the right amount of food. The price is also good. I highly recommend Makai and will be back. I will be telling people I know they have to try this place if they want Ono Hawaiian food!!!",

    "text": "Makai presents itself with the same set up as your typical Chipotle with the option of assembling your own meal. I got the large portion with 3 protein options and 2 sides. Here's the catch, the protein option is not a set base price for all protein which makes it a bit misleading. If you decide to get the steak it's extra, if you get the poke it's extra. I have no problem with paying more for better quality meat but it should be made more clear. As for the meat itself, they sit in warmers which did not do a great job keeping the meat warm. The steak was tender but the poke was very salty. Now on to the sides, I chose to go with the mac salad which was good and the garlic edamame was as well. Makai is a nice option if you're on this side of town and seeking a clean Hawaiian food option. There are areas where they could improve but if you get just the basic meats without up charges it is a good deal.",

    "text": "Food is great! Went there to try out and see if their food would meet Hawaii people's expectation, and yes, it certainly has! We did not order the plates, but we bought a la carte and brought it home to share.   The pulehu steak was pretty good. Could have provided us with a little more, but it was certainly good.   I like chicken katsu but have a difficult time looking for a Hawaiian Food restaurant that can make good chicken katsu, and this place had some bomb ass katsu. The chicken katsu was thick, not flat like most restaurants. On top of that, the katsu was super juicy. My son absolutely loved it.  The kalua pig was juicy. It was so delicious that it really made me feel like I was at home. I can make kalua pig at home but when I don't have time or patience to cook it, I would like a restaurant to have it. Makai's one was so ono!  I am not a big fan of Poke, but my brother and boyfriend thought it was good. Almost to the point that they wanted me to make a second pick up within 15 minutes of bringing the food home.  They also sell a handful of different flavors of Hawaiian Sun drinks. Of course, the price is pretty high for a can of Hawaiian Sun but my kids loved it so I purchased it for them.  The atmosphere is simple but relaxing. Super clean, and the people were pretty nice. There are lots of parking. I can't wait to try the different types of chicken and steak. I recommended this restaurant to a lot of my friends that live in Vegas, and I hope they feel the same way about their food the way I do.",

The serving was a lot but we never had the intention of finishing it in one sitting but we just wanted to try as much of their proteins. The mochiko chicken was my favorite it had just the right amount of sweetness. The teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu was also good. The Kahlua Pig was so tender and moist and the Spicy Tuna Poke was not too spicy and it was my first time trying Poke and I think it paired well with the rice. I loved their Kimchi slaw and it wasn't too overpowering. The staff were very helpful since it was our first time. They have all these different sauces for the meats. And for 22 bucks including tip (which was optional) you really get a lot for your money and had leftovers for the next day.",

Basically, their bowl is the 2 meat combo without sides. You might as well just get the 2 meat combo because then you get 2 sides! I chose garlic edamame and kimchi slaw. I love kimchi, and this was a kimchi like coleslaw that paired great with the white rice.   I can't wait to go back and try some more stuff.",

    "text": "Brought here by a family from O'ahu, it's a relatively simple menu highlighting one of Hawai'i's most quintessential meals called Plate Lunch or Mixed Plate (if the plate has more than one entree). There's no shortage of choices with nine meats, five sides, three bases, and a myriad of sauces.   My brother and I visited in the middle of the afternoon last week and it was surprisingly busy for a random weekday. There weren't any tables available when we arrived, but that quickly changed by the time we had our food. It's a very familiar style of ordering - you wait in line on the left and order down the line at the counter until you reach the cashier.  Pricing: Ono (Small): 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base | $4.99 Ono'er (Medium): 2 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $6.99 Ono'est (Large): 3 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $8.49 Bowl: 2 meats, 1 base | $5.99 Salad: 2 meats, dressing | $7.99 (or $5.99 without meat) *Steak is an extra $1 per serving *Poke is an extra $1.25 per serving *Brown Rice is an extra $0.50.  We opted for two \"Ono'est\" plates to try as many options as possible. The first plate: Pulehu Steak, Kalua Pig, Hawaiian Poke, Tossed Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing, Macaroni Salad, and Brown Rice ($11.24). The second plate: White Rice, Mochiko Wings, Chicken Katsu, Seared Spicy Ahi Poke, Macaroni Salad, and Kimchi Slaw ($9.74). We really enjoyed all the items. Everything was flavorful and exactly what you want in Hawaiian eats. The tossed salad was fresh with a great dressing; the kimchi slaw was surprisingly delightful; and all of the OGs were done right (Kalua Pig, Poke). This is definitely the best plate lunch spot in Vegas!  Extra details: There are two types of Ahi Poke, Hawaiian and Spicy; both can be seared per request. There are sauces available next to the soda fountain: Da Katsu Sauce, Da Spicy Sauce, Da Steak Sauce, and Da Yaki Sauce. (The names may have changed a little because I swear there was a Spicy Yaki?) I really liked the Spicy/Spicy Yaki sauce; it went well with the Pulehu Steak and Katsu.",

This place is fast food style, all the food is precooked and lying on trays and you get to pick what you want kind of like chipotle. They have size options that comes with rice, meat, and sides. They also have up charge items like brown rice, beef, and poke.   I got the large size because it's the most bang for your buck. You get three meats, and two sides.  I got the spicy poke, chicken Katsu and mochiko chicken wings. Sides I got the kimchee slaw and of course the infamous macaroni salad. My friends also got the kalua pork, teriyaki steak and teriyaki chicken, sweet corn, and garlic edamame. We basically ordered the entire menu.   Everything I had was pretty delicious. The poke was definitely fresh and flavorful. The pieces of tuna were large and fresh!  My chicken Katsu was very crispy. It isn't seasoned so you need a sauce. The mochiko chicken wings were sweet!  Really bomb. The kalua pork was fatty and juicy, not dry at all. The kimchi slaw was a great balance to everything cause it was refreshing and spicy. My macaroni salad was creamy and traditional. The sweet corn was very good as well. For the edamame I couldn't really taste the garlic.   The only thing I would stay away from is probably the steak. It and as very dry, overlooked and tough. Definitely will come back again.",

    "text": "To show you how great this place was for me, I came here on two consecutive days and I was staying at Mandalay Bay.  Some of items I triedI included: Katsu (cripsy outside, tender inside), Teri chicken (good flavor), mochiko wings, (not enough mochiko for me) kalua pork (tender and not dry) , spicy poke,(yummy)  garlic edamame (So good! ), kimchi slaw (yummy, carrots included) mac salad.(Not overly sweet, shredded carrots included).   I really don't like having too many carrots for the side dishes because my bestie is allergic to carrots, nuts, soy, and corn. So pretty much everything on the side was not a great choice.   I haven't tried the pulahu (grilled versions) since it was $1 more, but will next time.  However, the protein here is really good. Their teri chicken among other meats are grilled and has that great BBQ flavor you find on the islands. Their sauce (Da sauce) here, oddly enough is very watery.  But when I ate more and more of it, I actually liked it more because it doesn't cover up the bbq taste and just give a hint of teri sauce or spicy, depending which bottle you get.   Their Ono'er (Medium) is about $7.50 after tax and pretty much is enough to feed a grown man. The Poke here is delicious and I was able to just buy 1/4 pound as well.  Will be back soon for Ono gridz!",

So basically they're salad constitutes lettuce and some shredded carrots and two little cups of poke which cost me $10.60!

I've eaten food from here twice and both times were pretty disappointing. I decided to give them another try this week. And they still failed to wow me. I had a bowl with Kalua Pig and Pulehu steak. The meats were both ok, not much flavor, nothing special, steak was a little tough. I also got a side of kimchee slaw and sweet corn. The corn tasted like it had been dumped straight out of a can. And the kimchee slaw, omg, it was awful. It tasted like it was old or some of the ingredients were old, like it had been sitting and was starting to go bad. I couldn't eat it. If they upped their food, like a lot, their portion to price is good. But that's about it.",

Yesterday, after our 2 hour shopping trip at Ikea, we came here. And, I must say...It filled me up really good!  How their Menu works is that you have your choices of 3 sizes...Ono (Small), Ono'er (Medium), and Ono'est (Large).  I saw a picture of the menu on here, so I won't go into great detail in that. I'll just give you the Basics.  Ono: Consists of 1 Serving of Meat, 1 Side, and a Base (White or Brown Rice). Ono'er or Medium: Consists of 2 Servings of Meat, 2 Sides, and a Base. Ono'est or Large: Consists of 3 Servings of Meat, 2 Sides, and a Base. Bowl: Consists of 2 servings of Meat, and a Base. They do have a Salad for I Believe 6.99  I had a Medium: Which was White Rice, Chicken Katsu, Teriyaki Chicken, Macaroni Salad, and Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing( Which was Delicious)  I didn't think it was gonna fill me up, it did! I will admit, the portions they give are not as plentiful, and it may not fill most people up.   My opinion?? I would definitely be back, should I ever be in the area...but it is too far for me! You don't have to take my opinion for it.....Try it for yourself! =)  Mahalo!",

    "text": "Makai Pacific is very similar to other Hawaiian type restaurants (Ono, L&L), but seems to take on more of a \"poke\" shop vibe where you build your bowl from size, base, meats, and sides. They also do serve poke, but reading from reviews - they're more popular with the meats.   Order at the front before you sit down to eat. I went with a small bowl (starting at $4.99) where I got a choice of 1 meat, side, and rice. You can also choose a bowl (2 meats and rice) or a salad if you prefer. White rice or brown rice ($0.50 more for brown), meat options (only three is included and the other types of meat cost more), and sides.   My bowl ended up consisting of white rice, chicken katsu, and macaroni salad. Everything is cut according to \"scale\", so they give the same amounts of food to everybody (or as close to possible).   I thought the food was pretty decent. For the price, you do get quite the mouthful. White rice wasn't too hard - I liked that it was more on the softer side. Macaroni salad was tasty, but not my favorite (still prefer Ono's). Chicken katsu was definitely the star of my bowl. I got a good number of pieces - each piece was crispy on the outside, but cooked well on the inside. Dipping it into the katsu sauce gave the chicken more flavor, but I also liked having the sauce accompany the rice. For $4.99, I definitely cannot argue.   Workers were friendly and nice. Utensils and sauces are self-serve. My friend and I were in and out within 30 minutes. If bigger parties come in, there might be a wait, but overall - you shouldn't be in here too long.   tl;dr - Decent and authentic Hawaiian bbq at a very affordable price. I enjoyed the chicken katsu, but I wish they had more than just chicken and pig as \"included\" meats - having some other meats would broaden their menu. I wouldn't visit Makai if it were out of my way, but I can see myself returning if a friend was craving Hawaiian food.",

They are happy to explain the menu choices and tell what your options are.    Food- I stick to the two choice option ( ono'er) if you are really hungry they have a three choice option (ono'est). I love all the food here but my go to is the  white rice -chicken katsu/ Teri chicken combo with double mac salad!!! Yes you can get double of anything even on the main choices like if want double chicken katsu.    On a side note if you get the Mochiko chicken you only get 3 pieces? This is the reason for only four stars not five! So I would get double Mochiko chicken. Yes it's really good just that I feel they could give more......... They also have poke just two choices, Hawaiian style and spicy tuna. You can choose this as a side or get a container like 1/4 pound or whatever you like. Other side choices are Kim Chee, edamame and garlic edamame and corn.    Next to the soda machine is all of the sauces, forks, knives and napkins and stuff. They have sauce cups to take sauce home with you if you doing take out.     It seems like every time I go in here it's always busy but you usually don't have to wait long as they are fast in getting your order and getting you on your way!  Check this place out and give them a try, Happy eating!!!!!!!      This place man!! I hate to do this but, I am still frustrated by the fact that they still weigh their food! I mean this is local food place! (Not) No aloha spoken here. The thing is you can't blame the workers they are told what to do, I have been here many time when customers are like can I get more katsu or another Mochiko wing?? Oh we can't that's how it is!?!?!? Really, I mean if they could open another location they can stop weighing the food! Feed the people that are feeding your wallet......         The sad thing is that they do have good food but should I still be hungry when I leave? I can't be the only one one who gets a double order of Mochiko chicken just the get more! Oh well many Hawai'i restaurants are on the way to the ninth island!! Zippys is coming and I also know that Rainbows drive in is also looking for a location! Good luck makai and happy weighing o the food!!!",

Meats very very dry and had no flavor, you have to drench them in their sauces to make them edible. Their sweet corn side is literally corn strait from a can and they charge $2.50 for a small side. The only thing good about the entire experience was the Macaroni Salad. I will probably not be back and will not recommend either.",

When I posted that review the owner contacted me quickly about it and said he'd fix it.  Well, I slowly started coming back and testing the place.  The last few times they were \"out\" they had a nice and hot backup in the back.  Works for me!  Bravo!  90% of the time the employees are weighing the food right now.  Food is good.  I'm glad the owner fixed my criticisms quickly and took it seriously. Thank you, thank you, thank you..... uh, Mahalo!  I love the Hawaiian Style Poke, Teriyaki Chicken, and the Mac Salad!

I usually get the middle portion with two meats and two sides. Their Mac salad is creamy and they add potato in it to make it more heartier. Kimchi slaw is good but gets kind of runny  Their meat portions are fairly big with chicken katsu, kalua pig, and teriyaki chicken being no extra charge. Their poke is about a dollar more but it's fresh and amazing and worth it! They have their original and spicy version. Add that with two huge scoops or white or brown (extra 50 cents) or salad and you have a big full meal.  I eat half and safe the second half for my lunch the next day :)",

    "text": "A friend of mine wanted to eat a Hawaiian style plate lunch so I brought her here and got her a medium size bowl which contained 2 choices of meat, choice of white or brown rice and choice of 2 sides. The price is also very reasonable.  There was a sign that said they were known for their mac salad so naturally I had to give that a taste. I also tried a sample of their katsu sauce which surprisingly was very good. The flavor in that sauce is on point.  My friend had the chicken katsu with the kalua pig, white rice and a double serving of the mac salad.  The mac salad is one of the best. They use little chopped potatoes which actually makes a huge difference that turns the texture around.  The fish surprisingly tastes very fresh so if you're looking for a spot for poke then come here. They will even let you take a sample before you decide to buy. I asked where he got his fish from and he was able to answer my questions before I even got to ask any of my other questions about the fish so they do know what's important information to us and I appreciate that.   I'll be using this place as an example for my friends what we on the islands eat daily.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, but I have to take down 2 stars.  So when Makai first opened, the food was great and the employees were very friendly. The problem was that they were new and could not cook the food fast enough to keep up with the demand of customers coming in. A lot of times, they would say \"sorry, we ran out of chicken katsu (or whatever). Do you want to wait 10-15 minutes or would you like to choose something else?\" All. The. Time. Several months after things calmed down, it was consistent. The food was always tasty. I was happy that they finally figured things out and was able to keep track of when they needed to start cooking more stuff to avoid making customers wait around. The only thing I noticed was that people would be sad when the poke was sold out, but I don't eat that so it didn't matter to me. Yup, you heard right. Someone who was born and raised in Hawaii who DOESN'T like poke? WTF is going on here??  Anyway, lately this place has been disappointing. No matter what I order, something ends up not tasting right. My usual is the bowl since the sides are nothing special. My order the other day was Kalua Pig, which was tasty and the Teriyaki Steak, which was horrible. Could not taste any of the teriyaki and it was not tender at all. Another time, the Chicken Katsu tasted gross and undercooked, when usually it is pretty good. I could go on and on. Service is also not as friendly as it used to be. But I get it and sometimes feel bad for them when I see customers changing their minds at the last minute when the food was already placed into the bowl, or when they want to try samples of everything.  I still come here but definitely not as often as before. Hopefully they won't keep going down this route...",

Everything is pretty good!  Their poke is delicious but only when they have it. So if you want poke, come early because they will run out. The mochiko chicken and kalua pig are my go to's when they run out of poke. I like choosing brown rice when I can, but every time I've come here and gotten brown rice, it's always so hard. So I end up not eating my rice.   They have \"yaki\" sauces: regular and spicy. Highly recommend the spicy on pretty much everything!   Price is reasonable, customer service is always great. I wouldn't drive all the way over here just for it. But if I'm in the area and want Hawaiian food, I'll definitely stop by.",

From the delicious \"Mochiko Wings\" that I could devour by the dozen to their crispy, juicy \"Chicken Katsu\" to my favorite side of \"Kimchee Slaw\", all of it freakin rocks and has they've become an almost weekly stop.  I never eat in, always take out.   But the queen of the castle, cream of the crop, apple of my eye, most beloved item on the menu is their spicy ahi poke.  The portion as part of a meal is never enough, so I order the larger size on its own.  There's been several times where my wife and I get a pound of it for $14 and pair it with rice and salad at home for a satisfying dinner.  I try to go before 7pm because they occasionally run out and that's really the only time I end up on Skype with my psychiatrist in a parking lot as they help me through breathing exercises while I sweat profusely, rocking my body back and forth with Celine Dion's version of \"All by Myself\" on infinite loop.

    "text": "This place use to be a great place to eat. It was a bargain too. But unfortunately, it seems like they are falling into the same thing a lot of restaurants in this town fall into. A few months back, they raised the price on all of the items while giving smaller portions. They started to change the ingredients to save money and the food quality took a hit also. Two big red flags. Everything became overly salty. Even after this I decided to give them another shot thinking that maybe I just came at a bad time. But the food portion was even smaller and didn't taste as good as it tasted the previous time. My chicken was way over cooked and the steak was tough and hard to chew. And I don't know if it's just me, but their customer service took a serious hit recently, they use to have very good customer service, being somewhat of a regular, I stopped seeing familiar friendly servers, and seen them replaced with severs who don't seem to know what they are doing. Or even care about what they are doing for that matter. That's three big red flags. It sucks because I really enjoyed the food here and the atmosphere. I'm giving two starts because I'm hoping they can change back before it's too late. I may give them another shot sometime in the future. But if everything is the same as it is now, I'll have to take this place off of my go to list.",

Very delicious and extremely perfect size for a quick bite to eat(not to mention very inexpensive) I ate the poke (meat option) white rice (base) and garlic edamame (side).

    "text": "I would like to make a legitimate review here. But I rarely ever leave reviews, so the last part is the real reason why I'm writing all this lol  Makai seems to be either a hit or miss when I go here. The first time I tried Makai, the food was just alright. I was a bit disappointed in their chicken katsu as it seemed to be a bit overcooked. However the poke was phenomenal! Which is partly why I came back. The other factor was that the staff was so nice.   This time on the other hand was weird though because it was as if things had switched! Tonight I tried their mochiko wings, Hawaiian poke and chicken katsu. Great taste, nothing overcooked - I was so happy I stopped by here for dinner. I guess this makes up for their customer service.   *****WHAT I REALLY LEFT THIS REVIEW FOR***** I usually don't have a problem with \"poor\" customer service as I've worked in the food industry before. I get it. It can be pretty annoying working around food all day. HOWEVER, I have no idea what triggered this girl to make me feel like I shouldn't be here. I ordered and when she added rice to my plate, she stared me down in silence. Like... Alright. Did I do or say something? If this was my first time, I would have been completely confused as to what I needed to tell her next.  I was completely taken off guard but I just proceeded telling her the meats I wanted. Apparently she didn't hear the last thing I ordered in which she, once again, stared me down in silence. Her facial expression looked so irritated. Resting bitch face or not, it was the weirdest, most uncomfortable thing I experienced. \"Poke\" I said again. She then asked me which flavor I wanted in a really annoyed tone.  Whoever the chick with the nose stud is - It's really, really weird and uncomfortable to stare down customers until they speak. If you didn't hear something we say, if you need us to tell you what we want next, SPEAK UP. Not everyone knows what to do. If you were having a bad day, I apologize. But please don't take it out on customers who didn't do shit.",

We got the teriyaki steak with spicy mayo poke I believe? The poke bits were big and flavorful! The steak was good but dry, so I'd probably get something else instead. The steak and poke are additional charge to the base price.   As for our sides we got macaroni salad and kimchi slaw. The kimchi slaw is so so good!! I'd probably get that as both my sides! It also came with 2 scoops of rice, so again, plenty of food.",

I got the large plate with 3 meat and 2 sides. I got the pig, steak, and the chicken wings. For the sides, I got the kimchi slaw and macaroni salad. I also got a 1/4 of the spicy ahi poke on the side. Everything was so delicious. I like their sauce they provided on the side by the condiments. I loved their Kim chi slaw and the chicken wings. Perfectly made! Their steak was tender and the pig was too. Can't say anything wrong or bad about this place.",

When you walk in the place is pretty nice and there's a lot of parking space.  Set up is definitely similar to chipotle where they put what you want in a bowl while going down the line.  I got the Ono'est (largest) where you get 3 meats and 2 sides. For the protein I got the Kalua pig, Mochiko wings, and Hawaiian style poke while sides I got macaroni salad and garlic edamame.   Pros: The Mochiko Wings and Hawaiian Poke! The Mochiko wings were awesome. Sweet and salty and the chicken was still moist which is always a plus. The Poke was great. Nicely cubed and marinated with great flavor throughout. (But both have a fee to get them as a protein)  Cons: The pork and macaroni salad. The pork was way too salty. I had to take a bite of rice with it just to eat it. The macaroni salad I found was a bit saturated in mayonnaise so that's all I could taste which was a bit of a let down.   Overall it was not bad. Would I come back? Maybe but I think I'll try different places to compare first.",

Loved everything about this place just the shopping structure it's in needs to fix their parking lot. Great job Makai Grill definitely would recommend based on service, food and the portions are amazing for the prices loved it!",

Now that is incredibly long when you got a Chiptole like set up.   I ordered Katsu, Teriyaki steak, with 2 sides. The Katsu was so over cooked I took 2 bites. Not to mention the sauce for the Katsu was terrible. Ok, now the steak. I paid $1.00 upgrade for steak and no kidding, worst steak I've probably ever had. It was so chewy, no matter how much I chewed i would of choked if I continued to try. The bathroom toilet was broken, and their 6 bottles of teriyaki sauce were all empty.  So I put the lid back on after about 4 bites total and gave it to a homeless dude.",

They were 12 people deep waiting in line. We walked right to the register and ready to pay. Food was almost ready (called 6 minutes prior) so they're super speedy!  We ordered a large bowl consisting of mochiko wings, poke, teriyaki chicken, white rice. All their sauces on the side and a glass of water.    I would recommend this place to friends and family. There is also a dessert place right next door. Cookies and ice cream to finish it off right. Enjoy!",

There are lots of places to sit inside, and their outdoor area is nice and spacious as well. Perfect place to just chill and talk with friends and family while eating great food.",

All the food was cold because it's not made to order like other Hawaiian bbq restaurants.  So while I'm ok with the food and would come back it would not be my first option.  I really like the system, they weigh the food so that you get a consistent portion in your bowl.   I feel perfectly full with a medium order.  I think all the great chefs measure their ingredients so the consistency, quality and portion is always there.",

I ordered a small spicy mayo poke with mac salad and brown rice (with furikake sprinkled on top, naturally). All very good. Minus one star because I think they could serve a little bit more poke with this particular order because I ran out before even finishing the carbs on my aluminum plate....  Overall the ambiance of the place is welcoming, and I am all for their playlist of island tunes. I'll be back!",

There was only one staff at the counter resulting in a small line that moved fairly quickly.  I opted for the large plate with teriyaki chicken and both kinds of steak plus brown rice, macaroni salad, and tossed salad.  I would say the teriyaki chicken was the highlight and was quite tasty.  The two kinds of steak were OK.  Not exactly the tenderest cuts of meat, but they were decent.  The portion size was quite large for the price which was a big plus.  The salad really should be served in a different cup, though, as it doesn't do well next to the hot meat.  Plus, the dressing runs all underneath everything else.  Their katsu sauce is also a bit different than traditional Japanese katsu sauce.  They do have fountain sodas you can refill which is a plus, and overall the place has a casual and friendly environment!",

I got the kalua pig and spicy ahi poke (poke is an additional $1.25) with mac salad & garlic edamame, while my husband got kalua pig, shoyu ahi poke, corn & mac salad. Food was amazing!

I don't know if I came on a bad day or what but all the meat that I ordered tasted really dry. I was excited to try their mochiko chicken wings because i love mochiko chicken and it's been a while since I've had it. Unfortunately, I was super underwhelmed with everything I ordered. All the flavors were lacking. I even tried dipping the meat in the sauces (I got all 3) and it just wasnt doing it for me. The kimchee slaw was actually the worse kimchee ive ever tasted. It was more on the bitter side. Some of the garlic edamame was also cold. I ended up not being able to finish my meal. In my opinion, the food here wasn't what I was expecting. It was just okay. Other than that the workers here are really friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I guess I'll give this place a 50/50.. 2.5 stars. I'll probably have to come back in a few months and just try again.",

    "text": "A Hawaiian coworker recommended this place and he was right!  This is my new favorite spot to go to.  Large meals, great food, great prices and authentic cuisine.  I came here and told the guy working that I wanted a 3 protein two side plate and to make it how the locals would have it.  Katsu, wings and pork with two scoops of rice, mac salad and garlic edamame.  The plate that was less than $15 is enough food for two people.  The guy working did not steer me wrong and everything was delicious and pure comfort food at its finest.  My favorite items were the cats, pork and mac salad....but the biggest surprise to me is how good their poke by the pound is.  Not many people had mentioned it on their reviews but if you ask me, this place has the BEST poke.  They only offer two kinds, spicy and Hawaiian, but the slices of fish are large and the quality is amazing.  I've been back a few times and just get 2 pounds of poke and their rice. This place is so good and the people who work there love what they do and really care about their product.",

You just pick and choose what you'd like to build your order.   I went with a medium and chose my usual go-tos kalua pork and chicken katsu. Sides, I went with kimchi slaw and mac salad with white rice base. The katsu was cut in front of me, and everything was super hot and fresh. Kalua pork can be salty at some places, but these were seasoned perfectly. The spicy kick of the kimchi slaw and creaminess from the mac salad complimented the meal.  Great fast-casual atmosphere, and speed without the fast food taste. If you haven't been here, you're missing out!",

Their food and music playlist is so reminiscent of days in Hawaii.   Their store plays all of my favorite local jams, remains a nice and tidy environment, and employs friendly & positive workers. Not once have I ever received attitude or a bad experience with their staff!   Their chicken katsu is to die for and their side dishes are as hearty and filling as their main course meats! Lastly, their condiments are the cherry on top. The Chicken Katsu sauce and their Teri sauces are truly one of a kind. You can even add furikake to your rice!!  No matter what you choose, your meal is delicious from start to finish!!!!",

My chicken katsu, pulehu(bbq) steak, both pokes, and sides (corn, and chamber slaw) are amazing. The only side I didn't like personally was the kimchee slaw, it was a weird flavor but that is just my OPINION. My mom got the Kulua pig and teriyaki chicken and said it was good as well. I loved it, and I don't really care for local food places out here in Las Vegas. A+",

He laughed at me for asking about the portion sizes for chicken as he cut me six pieces for two orders instead of what I had been informed was the standard 5 per order. I asked him why he was laughing at me and his response was a sarcastic \"no reason\". I felt incredibly disrespected as would anyone, I'm not sure as to why he would think that was an acceptable form of service. There were two other employees around who both apologized for the employee when he walked to the back, who mind you, sent another employee around the corner to look at me, laugh and walk back. The food here is good but the atmosphere is tainted with cruelty. It's not hard to find Hawaiian BBQ in Vegas, you'd think they'd teach their employees to be respectful given the immense amount of competition.",

    "text": "Aloha Everybody. Excited that we had another hawaiian restaurant in Vegas, we finally decided to make the drive from da east side to Makai which is way out there. Happy for those who live on that side with the convenience of a local style restaurant in their neighborhood. All excited for some pulehu chicken which was on the pictures I looked at in yelp. We get there and the girl who by da way didn't greet us, just looked at us like ok what do you want. Being that is was our first time there didn't know anything about da menu or the different size of plates they had. So, we start to order. I proceeded to order da pulehu chicken and pulehu steak combo, well to my disapointment, even tho da pulehu chicken is still on the menu, they discontinued making pulehu chicken. Being a guy who likes to eat, I decided to go with da large plate with 3 choices of meat. Went with da pulehu steak, kalua pig, and teriyaki chicken. This is where I start getting disappointed. Da steak was already cut up, sitting in a container which I can only assume is hot. I could already see da fat on da steak turning white like it is getting cold. I'm thinking maybe they going to micro it but duh it's in a aluminum container. Da portions were not quite what I'm used to being that I just came back from Hawaii. Large plate I guess meant larger portions of rice. Da teriyaki chicken was burnt and also already sitting in a container. Kalua pig was sitting in its juices, thinking ok that looks good. At this point da only friendliness I got was from da cashier, who flipped the screen and told me to pick a % on how much to tip. I still gave da max 15%, \"support da locals\".  Sat down to eat, and wow da kalua pig was super salty, da teriyaki chicken was burnt, and as I thought da pulehu steak was cold. My daughter loves shoyu, so I put some on her rice. Aloha shoyu is da bottle but it was watered down. She had da chicken katsu and da sauce tasted like ketchup and worterchier mixed. No real katsu sauce. I am by no means a food critic and not here to put people on blast, but this was not a good dining experience.  Da staff should have more ALOHA, it wasn't busy at all to be rushing us on our order. Not to mention, not even assisting us first timers with da menu. Maybe that should be da first questioned asked. \"Aloha is this your first time here?\" It was to obvious that da reason da cashier was a little friendly, was because of da tipping aspect of our encounter. If you don't sell items on da menu anymore, please take it off da menu and somehow inform your customers on da website or yelp. Poke was horrible, they only had one kind which was spicy tuna. Not spicy at all. Da lack of communication from da time you walk into da place needs to improve to include taking items off da menu. Da food is like \"LUNCH WAGON\" food. It's like someone went to a construction site in Hawaii and brought da lunch wagon back to vegas and stuffed it in a restaurant. Da food would be perfect for sweaty construction workers and people at da beach. Not really good for a restaurant type atmosphere.  If da owners did a few tweeks to improve da quality of how da food is stored before serving, how its cooked (over cooked and over seasoned) and teaching da staff to spread \"ALOHA\" to all da customers who come in. This place would be a perfect addition to da hawaiian community who live in vegas.  Sorry it was a long review guys, but I think this place could potentially be a great place to eat at. Mahalo for reading.",

BBQ beef had very large pieces and was over cooked and zero taste, but sure had some jaw breaking moments trying to eat this thing.  If it had been thin sliced and marinated for several days might have been tastier.  Mochi chicken was alright but just 4 very tiny pieces, come-on.  Cold slaw kim chee was pretty good and the mac salad was a bit on the warm side, (maybe it was just made or sitting to long).  Hawaiian Sun drinks were warm and not in a working display cooler, bad.  But we were given a styrofoam cup for ice.   Lots of take out at this location.  The service was good and the workers very friendly.  Need to review the way things are set up because the food is being served on the extremely dry side.",

They do give very generous portions of the chicken katsu which is always a positive. I don't like that their edamame is always cold. A few times that I have got their edamame it is also wayyyyyy under cooked and seemingly uneatable. I would give this place a try if you are looking for some island food in the southwest. There are definitely better options but if you live in the neighborhood it is convenient.",

My first impression is the only hawaiian vibe I got was the name on the sign. Inside is totally plain. There's not a single piece of hawaiian decor, atmosphere, feeling etc inside. I placed my order for a 2 meat item including poke.  The prices were fine, the portions were fine, the food was fine. Everything was just EH/FINE. Nothing I tried was bad or anything, but again everything in this place was just EH/FINE. Not one bite of macaroni salad, kimchi slaw, pork or poke did I go OOOH this taste really good. It felt like the owners didn't really know what hawaiian atmosphere/food really was. I mean you don't even have spam musubi which is a hugely popular hawaiian item.  This place is missing the hawaiian atmosphere and definitely missing the love of hawaiian food, it feels like someone looked up a recipe and TRIED to follow it, instead of just cooking and putting the hawaiian flavor/love into it.   There used to be a great place also nearby called Kauai Cafe and I quickly got to know the owner Dawn and her family. The family was all hawaiian and their food was AMAZING. She actually had the best spam musubi I have ever had. Sadly the only reason she closed was because she was over worked and burned out. I hope you can connect with the hawaiian culture a bit more.",

We got there at 8pm, which is an hour prior to closing. I wanted to get a couple of plates with Ahi Poke, but the guy at the counter said they normally run out of poke before 8pm. So we had to scratch that. Then I tried to order a plate with the Pulehu Chicken and again we were shut down with \"I'm sorry we ran out of the Pulehu Chicken too.\"  But the cook behind him was grilling some chicken. So whatever. I figured I would give it a chance and taste the food cause I'm sure it would taste good. Again, I was wrong. I got the Ono'er with teriyaki steak and mochiko wings. The teriyaki steak tasted like beef jerky from being in the warmer and the chicken wings tasted like plain fried chicken. I've tasted way better mochiko chicken than that. Well as you can see I don't think we would eat here again.",

Obviously we looked like it was our first time, so we got the know how's explained to us. :) Got the Ono'est with the Pulehu Steak, Poke, Teriyaki Chicken, Mac salad, and Edamame for the sides. Between the rest of us we had almost everything on the menu. First time in there and felt like a cafeteria setting seeing the foods sitting already cut and in hot pans. Sometimes that's bad, sometimes it's ok. You know what I can say is \"Backyard Party\" time back home in Whitmore Village! Ono! Simple! Somewhat generous portion, and everything tasted like it was freshly grilled. Right on for the braddahs with this simple concept and clean atmosphere. The only thing holding me back from the \"5th\" star? You don't feel the ALOHA from the workers behind the counter and if you know what I mean, no matter the restaurant, place, time, it always make you enjoy everything that much better with a simple \"greeting\"! Recommended overall if you're on this side of town! Food is fresh, prepared and seasoned just about right. Katsu sauce wasn't katsu sauce, Teri sauce was too sweet, overall worth what you pay for.",

I will ask for it to be separated because it was pretty juicy and I don't like soggy rice.  The taste was all on point.  My mom had chicken katsu, brown rice, kalua pig, Mac salad and garlic edamame.  The Mac salad is really good you can tell someone from Hawaii made it because it is ono.  I will be going back for sure.  FYI, kalua pig is going to be salty, it's not like pulled pork.",

The prices have gone up and portions have gotten smaller. Need to weigh portions so you stay consistent with the protein. Not going to come back for a while.

I remember the first time I said out loud 'Wow! I've never seen so much white meat in katsu before.\"  I loved it!  Their rice was always on the dry side but that chicken katsu made up for it.  The spicy poke was also a winner.  I went there a few days ago and you can tell they've cut corners on quality.  Chicken wasn't as moist and kind of on the dry side with hardly any white meat showing.  Poke is a big disappointment with smaller fish cubes and more filler (onions, sauce, etc.).  The only consistent thing about this place is that the rice (white or brown) is still super dry.  So annoying with the dry rice all the time.  I hope the quality comes back like it was before.  As of now, you're better off going to L&L down the street at Russell.",

Another unfortunate coincidence - the taste of food has gone down.  Last week I ordered pulehu steak & it was over cooked; I was so disappointed.  This week I ordered spicy poke with mochiko chicken- the poke was too spicy, I couldn't finish the tiny container; the mochiko chicken tasted a lil different.",

Oh and the Katsu sauce sounds gluten free. The food was great and employees were helpful. Kimchi was surprisingly good. Definitely will come again. Btw don't try to compare this with island flavor because island flavor is in its own realm of Hawaiian foods, but much cheaper than island flavor. Aloha",

I always get the medium sized plate and for the price ($7), it's hard to beat. Sometimes I feel like the meats get a little on the fatty side, but that's nothing new for Hawaiian joints. A good friend of mine consistently gets the Chicken Katsu which he loves because of how moist it is.  The thing that I love about Makai the most is the POKE! It's amazingly delicious. Fresh, clean, and delicious. I've even introduced it to my mother who NEVER eats raw fish and she enjoyed it. I've read some reviews about how some people felt it wasn't okay for them to run out, and I actually 100% disagree. If Makai only makes a certain amount of tuna every day to consistently keep things as fresh as they have it right now, I'm okay with it. I always call ahead of time and confirm availability or hold a pound or so to ensure I'm not disappointed. Because a trip to Makai and walking out without tuna would certainly be a disappointment!  The restaurant is run by three brothers who really provide great customer service, a quality product, and at a great price. How can you go wrong with Makai??",

It is always the perfect meal because if I am super hungry I can get the Ono'er, but if I'm not as hungry I can get the Ono. The meat and sides are always so good and fresh. I also love how you can choose options for a healthy meal as well.",

That's so unprofessional on their part and a big waste of time. The thai house next door was fucking awesome though and they have several locations.",

Kalua pork was kinda tasteless ..chicken katsu was good but the katsu sauce tasted like straight ketchup which we didn't really like..the mochiko chicken wings was OK..I had a chicken wing with a feather still on it..the sides was probably the best thing...the Mac salad was good..kimchee slaw was also good but a little too salty. Hopefully when we come back the second time they will have poke. Service was good that's why I gave 3 stars otherwise I would have put 2.",

    "text": "5 star flavor but 3 star experience.  The only reason 2 stars were knocked off on experience is because they didn't have a couple items available during my visit.  No chicken katsu and no mixed veggie's.   I went in at 12:30 on a Saturday.  The katsu would've taken \"8-10 minutes\" to prepare.  I probably would've waited but he already had the 2 other meats on the plate when he told me there'd be a wait.  (When I said the 3 meats I wanted I said in this order \"mochiko wings, chicken katsu, palehu steak\").  I believe the guy at the start of the assembly line was pretty new, so I understand.. But to not have some katsu even cooking during a lunch rush was a little disappointing.   Regardless of this experience the food I did order was so ono I will definitely be back.   I ordered the mochiko wings (awesome flavor, juiciness & crunch) pulehu steak (tender and seasoned just right) Hawaiian style poke (almost as good as poke express, just wish the cup was a little bigger), Mac salad (finally a Hawaiian place that puts potato in the Mac salad!  Just like my grandmas), garlic edamame (delicious), and brown rice (just brown rice lol). My mom ended up with the same plate I had since they didn't have Katsu or mixed veggie's.  After she ate she forgot she wanted anything different.  Also ordered a \"kids meal\", white rice, poke, and they include edamame, just wish a small drink for the keiki was included.",

I ordered the small which is the perfect amount of food for one person. You get a protein, rice, and a side. I don't think anyone actually \"needs\" more than that lol. I noticed it can get pricey if you choose the more expensive proteins or want brown rice. (I hate it when the more healthy option costs more -_-). It's $1.25 extra for ahi tuna, plus .50 cents for brown rice. Not too bad but I'm always looking for good food AND a good deal. The chicken katsu was cooked perfectly, not too dry but still had that great crunch to it. The mac was a little too creamy for me, but I can see why everyone loves it. It compliments everything really well. My chicken didn't even need the sauce it came with, that's how good it was on its own.   It's right down the street from my hair salon and my nail salon, so I can't easily see this becoming my go to for a fast, delicious, and satisfying lunch!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch after hearing about it on yelp recently with a friend. We were excited to hear about a place near us that has fresh poke  Came here on 02/15/16 (President's Day) and they were open. Lay out kind of reminds me of chipotle, with an area on the side sectioned off for the line, with seating in the middle.   Menu is as follows  Choose your Size - Ono (Small - $4.99 - Base, 1 meat, 1 side), Ono'er (Medium - $6.99 - Base, 2 meats, 2 side), Ono'est (Large - $8.49 - Base, 3 meats, 2 sides), Bowl ($5.99 - Base, 2 meats), Salad ($7.99 - Romaine lettuce with cucumber, radish, wonton and glazed almonds, 2 meats, and choice of sweet onion, creamy sesame or ginger vinaigrette dressing)  Base - White Rice or Brown Rice (Add $0.50)  Meat - Chicken (Teriyaki, Pulehu, Katsu, Mochiko Wings), Pork (Kalua Pig), Steak - ADD $1.00 per serving (Teriyaki, Pulehu), Ahi Tuna - ADD $1.25 per serving (2 styles, one traditional hawaiian with limu, other with a spicy mayo sauce)   NOTE: Below notes a style called \"Pulehu\" which means \"broil over a fire\" but it is a style of cooking with seasoning mix (salt, garlic, sugar, black pepper) and maybe other variations  Sides - Garlic Edamame, Grilled Veggies, Sweet Corn, Macaroni Salad, Kimchee Slaw  Since this was the first meal of the day, lets say breakfast at a lunch time, i opt'ed for the ONO'EST (large) for the most food to last me thru the day and to try more stuff. White rice, Kalua Pig, Pulehu steak (didnt realize it was additional charge until i was paying.. oops) and traditional poke (i like limu...), sweet corn and macaroni salad  My friend ordered first and he had ordered the pulehu steak as well.. and ran out. I had to wait for them to cook some new ones (steak cooks fast and easy anyway... came out med rare too ! perfect XD ! my friend was jealous...) oops :3   Rice was a little on the drier side. Pre-made earlier on the day.   Pulehu steak was seasoned well. Cooked well. Medium Rare. No sauces needed.   Kalua Pig was flavored nice. A bit dry. But then again, the only thing i can compare it to was the actual kalua pig in hawaii during a luau from the pig... But id expect moister meat and not so shredded?   Traditional Poke was.... traditional poke, with soy sauce, sesame sauce, green onions, onions?, and limu. A little \"Stronger\" in saltiness than i'd prefer but fresh and tasted nice overall  Sweet corn is ... sweet corn Lol XD   Macaroni salad was like a normal mac salad but with cubes of potato too.   Overall not bad. Prefer over like aloha kitchen strictly cuz i dont have to get teriyaki everything and get diabetes later... I like the option about NOT getting teriyaki and the pulehu seasoning is pretty decent, especially on the freshly cooked MEDIUM RARE steak.. Lol.   Price at the end was like 11.50, which is a little pricey... wouldnt be so bad with additional $1 for steak and $1.25 for ahi poke... additional cost for steak i think is a little unnecessary. Ahi poke, may be a little more justified but the serving size is to a small sample cup =/   Good and convenient place in the area since the closest hawaiian place iirc is durango and warm springs (Ohana) or rainbow/hacienda (Boba Hut)...",

    "text": "Service wise, I would give this place a 5 star. They usually greet me right when I come in, ask me if I have any questions, etc.   I ordered the medium plate with a choice of two meats and two sides. This is usually a good portion for me when I'm just the right amount of hungry. I got the Mochiko chicken and the spicy poke. Now, I'm not really the best judge of poke but this place is always a hit or miss. Sometimes it tastes bland, sometimes it's too spicy or just the opposite. I can say with confidence that their Mochiko chicken is one of the best I've had.   Their Mac salad is also delicious! Go crazy with their sauces because they leave it near the drink machine so you can take as much/as little as you want. My gf mixes the spicy and non spicy sauces. I, on the other hand, is a fan their spicy sauce. I practically drink that.   I wish they had other locations that weren't so far on this side of town.",

Cooked perfectly, most, and full of flavor. The chicken katsu is the same also. Flavorful and tender but still crispy. Sometimes I have katsu that is fried so hard it hurts the roof of my mouth.. not here, it's perfect! I always get a small plate and it's more than enough and always fills me up. The portions are good and surprisingly big for how low the cost is.  Love the sides also. The garlic edamame is bomb and the flavor is perfect. Im pretty picky with my Mac salad but theirs is awesome!  It's always a good meal. If I can't decide what I want to eat, I always come here! My only complaint is that when I order on Postmates, the size of my meal is never consistent. I think I get more when I dine in. With Postmates my meal looks different every time and it is mostly rice and barely any protein!",

They always run out of items relatively early considering their hours of operation. And for the price, their meat quality has been filled with tons of gristle. I've been disappointed every time. It's a busy place. I get it. Popularity in a place does not exclude poor customer service to where having to communicate your order to the first person taking your order, ends up getting misconsTrued by the time you actually receive your order. Then, when you try to explain what you paid extra for, they give you attitude for having to get it for you or pack it to go. Such a shame as the items they have are simple and healthier compared to a lot of other Hawaiian fast foods joints. I feel their quality isn't what it should be for the price, and their lack of customer service takes away from wanting to go back all together.",

The wings were seasoned lightly, but was very good. They only gave me three small pieces, so i don't know if that is usual or because that was all that was left and didn't want to make more.....anyways the pork was about average. The macaroni salad was good and the kimchi slaw was just alright. I also ordered 1/4 pound of the spiciy ahi poke and that was probably the best item i ordered. I probably won't come back because it was a little over priced for the quality and i feel like i can find a better hawaiian food elsewhere.",

Something during the order process didn't seem right, so after placing my order and including a $5.00 tip for delivery, I called them only to find out they don't deliver but I could use GrubHub or something like that.

With that being said, there needs to be signage put somewhere that due to limited seating and the high volume of customers, customers shouldn't be allowed to reserve seating until they've gotten their food. The space is small with very few tables.   Tonight, my family and I walked in and waited in line to order our food. A family of I would say 15-20 people walked in and just sat down while some of them walked to the back of the line. The 15-20 people already in line had nowhere to sit while the family of 20 sat without ordering. One of the kids they were with took some of the sriracha sauce and teriyaki sauce bottles (the ones next to the soda machine) to the table and began to put some sauce on his finger, licking his finger and then putting more sauce on his finger after. Mind you, this kid was touching the hole from where the sauce was coming from. Disgusting. Where was management during this busy time?   Still doesn't change the fact that the food is amazing, so I'll only deduct one star for tonight's bad experience.",

I got the one item of kalua pig with mac. My girl got the poke with mac. The kalua pig was definitely better tasting than the poke but it was too salty to me. The poke is kinda standard. The mac was also too salty. It did have potato bits in it which was kinda nice.  There was a lot of people here and the staff is friendly but I thought the food was just okay.",

Chicken was so hard, it felt like a rugby match between the chicken and my teeth. Sauce was too sweet, so a little goes a long way.   Kimchi- skip it. Shredded cabbage with a bland spicy sauce. Couldn't taste that tang in an authentic kimchi, or the spice.   Overall 3 stars, because the only thing I really liked on my plate was the poke. And also not too bad prices. Didn't need to empty my bank account for a meal.",

I wanted to order for pick up and I called from my office and cell found it odd that the phone was never answered. I get there and there are 3 people in line. I placed my order and asked for an extra side of spicy poke I was told I can't unless I order the large meal. I even told them to charge me they apparently couldn't do that either. When I got to the register I asked to verify the phone number it was the same one I had called. He said that they don't answer the phone if they are busy. To me that's just bad service. You may ask why I still went only because it was the pregnant friend of mine whom really wanted the food..  the food was good but the service hmmm not the best.   Spanish translation   Decidi ir a este lugar ya que mi amiga me lo Habia mencionado y tambien tenia el antojo por que esta embarazada. Primero intente ordenar por telefono pero el telefono jamas fue contestado se me hizo raro de igual manera me fui a local. Cuando llegue solo habian 3 personas en linea en otras palabras no estaban ocupados. En pese con pedir mi orden y le pedi al muchacho un side adicional de spicy poke pero me aviso que no podia que tendria que ordenar otro plato mas grande que no me podia cobrar por lo que pedia asi que lo deje y segui. Cuando llegue a la registradora le pregunte al otro joven que si me podia confirmar el numero de telefono y si yo habia marcado bien le mencione que llame varias veces y de varios numeros y que no me contestaron. Y me dijo que si ellos estan ocupados que no contestan el telefono. Y eso para mi es mal servicio. Tal vez te preguntes porque igual fui ahi no fue por mi si no por la embarazada de mi amiga que tenia antojo.. la comida estuvo bien pero el servicio no tanto.",

There was a girl who had her hair in a bun thru her hat who served me and an asian boy who was at the register and they both were very friendly and seemed appreciative that I was a customer.   This deserves 5 stars all the way.   Plus as always, the food is great.   Which is why I obviously continue to return.

I tried the Mochiko wings, Teriyaki beef steak, and Poke. The sides were rice, corn, and macaroni salad. I can probably eat this stuff on the daily. Great comfort food served in a round tin foil. It quickly gets crowded here for lunch. You get a little bit of everything and it all has that island flavor. Thanks to my buddy Drew for posting about this place.  Recommendation: Mochiko wings, macaroni salad, and poke",

I usually get the medium (Ono'er) which allows you to get rice, two choices of meat, and two sides. That usually costs 7-9 bucks if you get the poke. The Katsu and Teri chicken is my favorite. Only thing I don't like about this place is that some of the staff can be stingy. I ordered chicken and Hawaiian style poke and when the server put chicken on my plate she literally took out a tiny piece of chicken and out it back in the pile. Same goes for the poke, sometimes they'll fill up the cup or sometimes they'll half ass it. Doesn't happen too much, but just watch out for that lol. Overall I do like this place.",

I'm not even half way done and I am full. They are very gracious with the servings as well. My mom got kalua pig and steak pulehu (to add steak it's $1 more but so worth it) sweet corn and Mac salad.

I can eat but I have not been able to finish their medium plate both times that I have been. The staff is also super friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have.  I will have to say the mac salad is probably my favorite thing on the menu (I love my carbs people). As for the proteins they serve, they are all good (I cannot speak for the beef because I haven't tried it yet). I am not a huge chicken wing fan but theirs are delightful! I will probably get them every time I come because they are that good. The chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu is also very good. Perfectly cooked!  I have tired both poke options and it is good poke but not the best I have ever had. If you are in the mood for poke, it gets the job done and it is very reasonably priced. I would probably order some of the other protein options before the poke just because the other protein options are so good! The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because a couple of items were really salty (the corn and Hawaiian poke) but this in no way will keep me from coming back because the food is that good!",

My husband got a small plate with white rice, kalua pork and mac salad. The kalua pork didn't have much cabbage but he said he likes it that way, and you can definitely taste the liquid smoke. I got a medium plate with white rice, double mac salad, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. And being the raw fish lovers we are we also got a quarter pound of the spicy ahi poke. The mac salad was good, not too salty or with overwhelming amounts of mayo. The katsu was crispy, and the chicken teri was so so tender. I wish the poke was cut a little smaller but the sauce was on point. For all of our food we paid 17 bucks which is cheap for all the food we got and the quality. This place kind of reminds me of a chipotle but with hawaiian food. I wish there was more selection but I will still be back here to try out everything else on the menu.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is seriously on the come up with island food. They don't refer to us as the 9th island for nothing.  Makai is located on Fort Apache, right across from Walmart and in the same plaza as Sweet Addiction.  It kind of reminds me of Chipotle in the sense where you get to choose what you want in your order. They have an assortment of sizes to select from that all vary in the base (white or brown rice), meat (chicken, steak, ahi poke, etc.) and a side if available. You can also choose to add on a side if you'd like. The ordering is pretty straight forward, so just go for what you'd like. If you decide on the poke, there's a regular one and a spicy. I opted for the spicy and it was delicious!  The restaurant itself actual resembles Chipotle too. It seriously is, just the Hawaiian version of it. The food is amazing and the staff was nice. There's a lot of seating inside, but if the weather permits.... Definitely choose to sit outside as there are seatings on the side.  Our first visit will definitely not be our last! This place had my boyfriend claiming it to be his favorite and I expect us to be visiting again shortly.",

You assume that they are either reheating it on the grill bc you see someone at the at grill and you are waiting longer than normal .  I was surprised that when I got home (less than 10 minutes) the chicken wasn't even luke  warm, maybe even one piece cold.  It was a bit disappointing and misleading.   The chicken was charred at some point but I just didn't understand the wait and the chicken being cold.",

And Makai is definitely at the top of my list. ; )   Located on the southwest side of town in a mini shopping center, is this hidden gem with the best katsu, teriyaki (steak & chicken), mochiko wings (my favorite), poke, mac salad, sweet corn, you get my drift. Everything on the menu is super delicious, haven't been disappointed once. Added bonus: my kids love it too!!   Prices are more than fair. And you get so much food so it's a good idea to share. Sharing is caring, right? ; ) I recommend the \"Ono'est\" 3 servings of meat, 2 sides, and a base. Does a mixed plate get any better than that? I absolutely love this place. It's my \"go-to\" now whenever I'm on this side of town. Highly recommended!",

Once you walk in, there is local Hawaiian music playing in the background softly. The menu has a decent selection, and the prices aren't bad.   The food cooked just behind the counter. It's sort of buffet style, they serve the food right in front of you, then you pay at the end and take your plate. It tasted good and the poke was delicious! Tables were clean, soda fountain was coke. TV had the olympics on. AC ofcourse. Worth a try if u want a taste oh Hawaii in Vegas .",

I always get the medium which is two choices of meats, two sides, and rice.     Always get the same thing.     Kalua pig- so damn tender and extra good with the teriyaki sauce on it.     Katsu chicken- basically breaded chicken.  But it's always crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  And they have a special sauce that takes it up a few notches.   It heats up crazy good too in the toaster oven if you can finish it.     Mac Salad- I'm not Mac Salad connoisseur but this stuff is ridiculous tasty.     White rice- its white rice.  Standard, nothing you are gonna call you mom and tell her about.   But it works with everything.    But in the end it costs like $8.25.   Fills my big appetite.   Leaves me happy and satisfied (that's what she said).  And it's like 5 minutes from my house.  Staff is nice.   Not a big fan of the paying process.   It asks if you wanna tip after you pay by credit and I always feel guilty not tipping.   But it literally takes them 87 seconds to put my meal together.    They are closed on Sunday though (sad music plays in background).",

    "text": "First, let me start by saying this place easily deserves a 4 star rating. Their staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the service is generally quick.   Lately, however, I've been coming here and they don't have any poke left. They say they make a batch of it every day and whenever it sells out, it sells out. I typically come here at around 6:30 or 7. The place closes at 9. Not everyone has the luxury of coming to a restaurant early enough to order one of their 6 or 7 menu items before it sells out for the day. Additionally, I frequent all the time and this used to never be a problem, so it seems like lately they are making less poke every day to maybe save money.  Their food is delicious. And I still recommend eating here. But they would receive a much higher rating from me if they didn't \"run out\" of one of their main menu items 2 or more hours before closing.  Also, to piggyback off of other people's reviews, they definitely take their time to weigh out portions of meat when the difference in weight and cost to them is very miniscule. It is kind of frustrating to watch.",

I'm not an edamame connoisseure so I don't have much to compare it to, but the stringy parts were getting stuck in my throat so I couldn't finish it.  The chicken katsu was pretty good, the kalua pork was soggy. Both servings were puny. You get a fair bit of food for the money but it's mostly rice; the amount of meat is disappointing. Macaroni is too salty, though slightly less so tonight than last time.  I'm gonna try L&L next time I'm in the mood for this kind of food. I like the greater variety you get at Makai, with your choice of 2 meats and 2 sides for the Ono'er, but there's plenty of room for improvement.",

Come to find out it's made to order so I was asked to wait 10 minutes, no big deal. However, 20 minutes later I was still waiting for my steak. Why it takes 20 minutes to cook steak is beyond me.   Third, my steak finally finished but was told I'd have to wait for the mochiko chicken to finish frying. That's when I was like, what the hell. I just waited over 20 minutes for my steak, now you're asking me to wait longer for my chicken? Instead I said to cancel my chicken and I'll just take something that was already cooked. I was trying my hardest not to get mad. I used to be in customer service, so I didn't wanna be that customer that gave a hard time over something that was out of their control. I had my mom and 2 year old in the car waiting, so I was kind of in a hurry and was not expecting to be waiting for that long.  I really do think their system needs to improve. Because waiting over 20 minutes for my food was a little ridiculous. Customer service was still great, everyone was very apologetic. I might not come back for awhile because of what happened, but my mom said the food was still delicious and it was worth waiting for.  Oh and another thing, the person grilling the steak and chicken was spraying so much Pam on the meat while he was grilling it. Why?! Never in my life have I ever seen that.",

It was our first time trying Hawaiian style fast food and it was beyond my expectations.  Service was friendly and portions are HUGE!  well worth all money (best bang for your buck).  We probably could have shared one plate, but we are able to eat leftovers as a second meal. Highly recommended to eat here if you want to stay off the strip and away from the hustle bustle.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: This review is based on catering.  After calling around to several other similar food locations, I came across Makai and looked on their website (and Yelp) for catering prices. They had an Ohana size and Regular size. To be sure, I called and spoke to Tony, the assistant manager, who kindly explained the sizes to me.   I chose the regular size for an order of chicken katsu and the total came to under $55 including tax, which was a LOT better than other food chains. I paid over the phone, which was no problem and set a time for pickup. Tony also informed me if there were any other questions/concerns and that when the order was ready he would give me a ring.  The day of, Tony called me confirming that the order was for that day and told me it would be an extra 5 minutes so they could prepare my order, which was no big deal to me! I'd rather wait a little longer for fresh, hot food :-) Since the order was paid, I just had to sign my receipt and wait for the food.   Once it was ready, an employee brought out my order with two small tubs of their katsu sauce and we were good to go!   Thank you Makai for the awesome and efficient service! Will definitely recommend to those looking to feed a crowd within a decent budget.  On the day o",

My boyfriend got the chicken katsu and pulehu steak. This review honestly would be 3 and a half stars but I rounded up.  I thoroughly enjoyed the teriyaki chicken. It was delightful, flavorful and grilled well. The pulehu steak, on the other hand, was pretty mediocre. It did not live up to its hype like the teriyaki chicken. I thought it tasted pretty bland. The chicken katsu was pretty standard as well. The rice was weird. Not sure how to explain it so that's all I'm going to say. The mac salad wasn't very cold like I'm used to with Hawaiian food (probably because they have it out on the counter, so no biggie). I loved \"Da Spicy Yaki\". It was a mysterious, delicious sauce that I made sure to bring to my table. The food overall is very filling. I normally get the medium (ono'er; two meats) and I generally can only eat half of it.  The ambiance is very clean and modern. I enjoyed the Hawaiian music they had playing in the background. Overall, a good experience.",

I ordered a salad... The price confused me because it costs seventy cents more and you get one side less than the two meat bowl. As you can see the 'salad' is lettuce. That's it. No topping as shown in menu. My 'salad' cost me 10.80. Look at the picture. That's sad. Lettuce and some meat.   The chicken was weighed and weighed again. She took five different pieces in and out of my bowl... I'm just like dude is five grams of chicken thigh that serious? The chicken was old and dry, which was a bummer. I love their chicken and sauce usually.   When I asked for two different dressings to try a new one she told me it would cost fifty cents... Then she has my friend bring me an extra so I had two of the same dressing!! Why?",

I didn't know what to expect, new restaurant, new owners, new chic cool, chipotle style decor. I had the steak and the spicy mayo poke. I was an instant fan. The marination of the steak and the freshness of the poke caught my attention because it tasted different and had that taste of the island. They have a good amount of meats to juice from, but I resorted to my usual steak and poke palate. The portions are worth it and the price point is not bad compared to some of the other spots in town.

Chicken katsu was perfectly crispy and paired well with their homemade sauces.   Prices are fair and I believe they match the quality & portion of food you receive. Order a size up for more variety and extra food for later. I highly recommend the canned hawaiian sun drinks as they pair perfectly with savory meals.

    "text": "Makai is the place to go here in Vegas if you're looking for solid Hawaiian food. The portions are very generous. I got the Ono'est, which is their large bowl, and I tried the Mochiko wings, Pulehu steak, spicy mayo poke, and sides of their garlic edamame and kimchi slaw. The highlight for me was their poke, which was a little unexpected considering it's not what they specialize in. The mayo was light so I could really taste the freshness of the tuna. The Pulehu steak was a little dry and chewy (tasted like jerky), but maybe I got a bad batch? I also heard that their chicken katsu was dank so I'm gonna have to try that next time!   Mahalo!",

Took a picture of my ono (small) but forgot to take hubby's ono'er (medium)...  We chose teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, wings, kimchee slaw, macaroni salad and rice.  We basically ended up sharing the meal because we wanted to try all of it!  Mark came over while we were finishing up and told us about the rewards program, so I downloaded the app right there and he made sure we got credit for what we had just purchased.  DEFINITELY putting this on the weekly rotation for lunch.  So happy we found it!",

Asked to see if I can pick up small of different types of meat for everyone to share and he said that would be considered catering I had to order ahead of time which I understood so I asked to make assorted plates for 5 people then he got super confused and kept telling me something about extra charge and wasted my time because again, it was last minute thing I still had to go back home to get ready so I got frustrated and left and never ever will return or recommending anyone we know. What's the difference between 5 people come in and order vs I pick up food for 5 people how is that catering option? Why couldn't he just mix up whatever options and make me 5 plates? They could've easily make $70-80 real quick from me but, it's their loss for business",

With different meal sizes and formats there's something for any sized appetite. The \"Ono'er\" has been my go-to size with two choices of meat and two sides. The teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu are the standout proteins, of the ones I've tried. The pulehu steak was a bit tough and the kalua pork slightly under seasoned, while the macaroni salad is the side dish not to pass up. For a fast food spot, Makai is a clear winner for a quick bite at affordable prices with large portions.",

Cali poke was also good. Not too spicy and etc and I'm sure a lil more spice wouldn't hurt. Still good.   One of the down falls was that the portions was not \"Hawaiian\" style.

The fact that there are so many different Hawaiian places in this area makes it tough to choose however I might have to place them as a new favorite! I came in last week pretty close to closing time which I hate doing but I was hungry! That didn't stop much though! Even though the selections were minimal since they were about to close I was still able to get some of my go-to dishes such as the chicken katsu and teriyaki steak! I was greeted right away by one of the employees in the lobby and he was so friendly and helpful! Even told me don't worry about feeling bad that they were getting ready to close! With knowing it was my first time he helped walk me through their process and become familiar with how the menu worked! The food portions are huge and well worth the price you pay! I believe I got the medium size bowl that allowed me to choose two meats and two sides! I'm in love with the macaroni salad and decided to double up on that along with my two meats! I will be back very soon to try out some of the seafood options!",

Came here for the wings and had to wait 15 minutes for them to make it. Another guy behind me and asked for teriyaki chicken and they told him 20 minutes. Then when they finally made the plates they were skimp with everything, the teriyaki chicken because they barley had any. The sides were so small. I don't think I'll be back to this location!!!!",

Every one is so friendly and always welcomes us back:) Don't hesitate coming here at all bc you won't be disappointed!  Oh and it's kinda healthy, Yelp says so when you type in \"healthy\".

    "text": "I was excited to try this place because it had high ratings. Walking in we were greeted by a staff member and I noticed that the place was pretty empty considering it was dinner time. The workers here do not have much energy or very welcoming and I did not see a single smile. One of the workers proceeded to tell us that they were out of katsu, kalua pig, and poke. I was extremely disappointed because those were the three top choices of meat I wanted to try. In the end I got a medium size bowl with chicken wings, puleho steak, brown rice, kimchi Cole slaw and salad.   To start off, the puleho steak was probably the best thing out of my bowl, especially when you eat it with their spicy sauce. The chicken wings were disgusting because 2 out of 3 of my wings had the feathers on it still! I immediately threw it away and just proceeded with my food. My salad came with a choice of either sweet onion or sesame dressing so I sided with sweet onion. The sweet onion sauce had a peculiar color because it looked like pepto bismol medicine. I decided to dip my fork in it to try it and it was WAAAAY too sweet. The whole time I watched the worker put my food into the bowl I felt like I was getting all the leftovers even though they still had two hours till closing.  Overall this place is okay. Their prices are pretty decent and you shouldn't expect much service because it's basically like a fast food place. I'm not sure if I would come back because I've read previous reviews that they always run out of poke and kalua pig by a certain time and those are the two items I want to try most, not to mention their chicken wings had feathers on it still. If you want a good experience, I suggest going during the morning or afternoon when more meat choices are available and you don't get the leftovers.",

    "text": "I finally tried this place out yesterday for lunch and ah the grindz broke mah mouth lol! I've been waiting for a place that sells poke by the pound since I moved here from Hawaii, well at least one that's close to me.  Taste: My husband got an Ono'er combo (2 rice scoops, 2 meats and 2 sides) with brown rice, BBQ Chicken, Katsu, corn and cold slaw. The BBQ chicken was pretty burnt and hard. My husband came here first and said the BBQ Chicken the day he came was cook just right. Katsu was good.  I got a pound of poke in both half regular and half spicy. The spicy poke wasn't spicy at all. But I understand that not many can tolerate spicy food. They had some sauces on the side which I didn't bother checking out so I probably missed out on some Sriracha or something so that was my fault. The regular poke was a tad, juuust a tad salty for me. Maybe it was just the batch. It wasn't too bad though. I had some of my husband's brown rice and mixed it with the regular poke to fix it. Other restaurant wouldn't bother on this but I do like that there are some seaweed and masago in their poke.  Quality: It was BBQ chicken and Katsu, dark meat but cheaply priced so it was fine. Beside the pulehu being pretty burnt and hard. I honestly can't say too much about \"fresh fish/sashimi in Vegas\".  Portion: The Ono'er was a generous size.  Price: I believe our bill came out to around $25 no drink but including a 10% tip. It wasn't bad at all. They charge extra $.50 for the brown rice option and $1.25 for each poke choice on the combo which was totally ok. A whole pound of poke was $13.99.  Service: The employees were nice but should come out of their shell.   Ambiance: Love the music. It was like I didn't get off my car. The place was nice and clean. It was very similar to Chipotle's food concept and restaurant design.  Location: Very convenient spot. Safe and open plaza. Will definitely add this to our new spot for when we pau grocery shopping.  Overall: This is like Chipotle but Hawaiian, good concept. This place is better than To See Roll. I wish they had Mahimahi though. I really wanted to give this place 5 starts but it's a 4 and a half for now. Well go back again and go from there. Overall it was still ono, mahalo!",

The Brown rice is hard, and the staff seems unhappy, seems angry with the choice i make for my plate, and seems so uninviting.

I ordered the Ono'er (2 meat combo, upgraded to poke [raw tuna salad] & teriyaki steak), it came with 2 scoops of white or brown rice and 2 sides.  I chose the Onolicious fresh kimchee slaw and Mac salad. I love that you can upgrade to add poke cause sometimes you don't feel like ordering a full plate of poke to yourself, when you just want a little variety w/ your plate lunch combo.  Instantly, I was happy that they offered that.  The price was reasonable and the quality of the food was excellent.  I also got to try the teriyaki, pulehu chicken, & mochiko wings from my family's plates and those were sooo tasty too.  I would definitely come back for some more onolicious eats!

    "text": "I was driving around my neighborhood when I Yelp'd Hawaiian food and Makai popped up. Saw the location and didn't recognize it on the map due to the fact that I drive by there 4x or more a week and didn't know about it blew me away. Regardless of having heard about it or not the reviews were fairly good on Yelp though there were  only 10, I had to give it a go! (After talking to one of the three owners who are brothers I learned they opened only 3 days prior to my visit, pretty amazing reviews considering how long it has been in business).  I walked in and it wasn't very busy but there were a handful of people eating in. Walked up to the counter and right away and was greeted by a friendly guy with a big smile. I asked, \"so how does this work?\" Meaning, how do I order? After explaining I pretty much choose the amount of meat I want and I get 1-2 sides along with rice (base). I ordered the Ono'est= Large: chicken katsu (x2), pulehu steak, tossed salad with sweet onion vinaigrette and garlic edamame.  -Chicken katsu: crispy, hot/fresh, not greasy considering its deep fried. -pulehu steak: tender, juicy, perfectly sweet and savory, real island bbq. -tossed salad: fresh and crisp, tried it with glazed almonds and though I'm not sure if it is homemade it paired great and was delicious. sweet onion vinaigrette: vibrant color, not too sweet. *there is also a creamy sesame dressing that sounded great too.  -garlic edamame: if you like garlic you will love this, edamame was still firm with a good crunch. They also approached me instead of me asking, if I wanted to try the poke and of course I did. The two I tried were ahi (tuna), one had a creamy texture/flavor and the other was traditional. Flavors all poke lovers would enjoy!  *Try to go early to be sure you get your hands on some.  Words to describe my experience here: Fresh, authentic, savor, Aloha, the bomb-dig-gity!",

All you can get at L&L is a barely sweet teriyaki that is the consistency of water, so I really appreciate Makai having a good sweet sauce.)  The chicken teriyaki is excellent.   The chicken itself in the Katsu is good (but see \"The Bad\" below regarding the Katsu sauce).  The garlic edamame is delicious.  Macaroni salad is tasty.    Customer service here is great.  They try hard to make you happy.  THE BAD:  The Katsu sauce is very very \"ketchupy,\" Needs more flavors in it than that one.  The ketchup aspect is much too strong.  If it were not for that, they'd get a 5 star rating.    Only other downside, if it even is one, is I wish they were open as late as L&L (til 10:00 p.m.).",

For my ono'est I got brown rice, which was delish with the chicken katsu and the pulehu steak. I swear their chicken katsu is the best I've had. It wasn't over fried and it had the precise moisture and texture. The pulehu steak was delish as well. It wasn't overcooked or dried. It was perfectly tender and the flavor was on point. I will definitely get the same thing the next time I order here. Also I had a bite of my friends poke, and it was fire. Texture melted in my mouth and it was perfectly spicy. For my sides I got the sweet corn and the macaroni salad. Sweet corn was also really good, perfect amount of sweetness, and very very flavorful. The macaroni salad was good also. It didn't have that heavy mayonnaise taste. You cant go wrong with the macaroni salad if you like macaroni salad, try this one. Promise you wont be disappointed.",

    "text": "I just moved to this area, hoping to find some good Hawaiian food and I was not disappointed! This restaurant is almost like a chipotle where you are able to create your own meal. What I really like about this place is that they have different size meals which is really nice especially for those who can't eat as much. When you order, you can pick between what type of meat, which kind of rice, and what type of side. Choosing the type of side you want is really nice because sometimes your just tired of the regular Mac salad. Don't get me wrong, I love the Mac salad but it's very nice to have options!   The ambiance of the restaurant is very clean and the staff is very nice and helpful! This place is defiantly on top of my list. So I suggest to check it out because you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVED Makai. I used to come all the time when I lived on this side of town and my last 2 visits here have been extremely disappointing. The second to last time I came it was around 8pm and they were completely out of poke and mochiko chicken. I figured it was gonna be closing soon which is why they were no longer refilling and it was understandable. What wasn't understandable was that when I asked for more furikake on my rice the guy told me he couldn't give me anymore. That's like telling someone they can't get more than one container of teriyaki sauce. But we couldn't get teriyaki sauce anyways because literally every single bottle was empty and no one was refilling them. Not only that but every table was dirty and we had to clean them ourselves. And again I figured it was close to closing time and to give them a pass and another try again. So today my boyfriend and I went around 5:30pm since we figured they were no where near closing and would definitely have food this time and we were wrong. They had no poke, no teri or pulehu steak. Lucky for me they actually had mochiko wings this time but they were pretty bland compared to the other times I've had them and my boyfriend's teri chicken was cold. I just hope they start prepping enough food for a whole business day if I ever decide to come back.",

    "text": "Being from Hawaii, I have certain expectations of Hawaiian Food. The first time I had the food here I nearly died and gone to heaven because of the legit Mac Salad and savory Kalua Pig.  My favorites.  The Mac isn't just macaroni swimming in mayo which I appreciate.  The overall ambiance of the restaurant is clean, staff is friendly and happy to be there.... I've been back SEVERAL times.  I enjoy their Teri Steak (+$1.00 per serving) with salad and Creamy Sesame Dressing as well - when I don't feel like eating so much rice, I'll get a Bowl which is normally 2 scoops rice and 2 choices of meats, and I'll substitute one scoop rice for a side(+$0.30), where I'll get the toss salad. (*For some reason I love the sesame dressing on my steak too lol).  For anyone commenting about the $1.00 extra for steak being unnecessary- I mean hello? It's steak. A lot of other places do an up charge for certain fish or steak..... & the $1.25 extra for Poke. It's Ahi I mean duh. Seems people are being overly critical and picky.  This restaurant has only been open for about 6-7 weeks and although they are still learning, this family-owned restaurant is a fun and delicious place to get local food from management/owners who truly care about the food and their customer experience. I look forward to seeing them grow, improve and succeed.",
