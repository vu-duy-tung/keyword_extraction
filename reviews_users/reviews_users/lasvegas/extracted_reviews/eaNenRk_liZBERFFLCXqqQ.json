Would for sure come back. Maybe even a couple times a week",

Service was excellent by James our server. Meal was cooked in front of you so delicious short ribs marinated skirt steak. Not to mention all the sides that come with it including rice and salad and kimchi Etc. Wait times can be a little longer if it's a busy night cuz it takes so long for you to finish up. Toothbrushes in bathroom and Icee slushies in front excellent touch. Overall very impressed one of the best places I've been to in Las Vegas.",

Ordered the large family combination meal.  The quality of meat was exceptional with many great side dishes.  They cooked for us which helped us enjoy the meal more.  Service was good even though the place was full.  The meal was a little pricey but you are paying for quality rather than quantity.  Definitely worth it as compared to the expensive buffets on the Strip.  Will definitely go again the next time we are back in Las Vegas.",

We had been fantasizing about a awesome Korean BBQ restaurant for many strenuous miles. In fact it is what motivated me to not throw down my trekking g poles and quit a few times.   Hobak didn't quite live up to the hype but it satisfied my cravings for tasty meal. And I think it did for my friends too. Each of us cleaned our plates and ate every last morsel of meat. Some of the side dishes were quite good but seemed a little bit lacking as other Korean Barbecue joints that I've been to you have more variety. The atmosphere inside was fun and Lively. One of the joys of Korean Barbecue for me is to cook my own food here they actually have waiters to do it for you a couple of witch we're not all that friendly nor attentive. A real shame because I really wanted to give this place for stars since it is in Vegas and very far from some of the other more popular Korean BBQ destinations near my home City in Los Angeles. If you are craving decent Korean BBQ with mediocre service you have found the right place.",

The wait was 1 hour long but after carefully reading reviews we decided it was worth the wait. It definitely was! Hands down the best service, food and atmosphere! As we were sitting there waiting.. I paid close attention to the staff, they had great communication skills - they worked so fast to get the tables cleaned and set for the next guest. Everyone was moving around and I could not even see one person slacking or on their phones. AMAZING! I absolutely was amazed and it simply got us to patiently wait for it table. Finally, or name was called and (I wish I could remember our servers name -horrible memory :( )  Our server sat us down and explained everything to us and also generously apologized for the wait! Whhhaat!? I just can't rave enough about this place! The food was just amazing and I can't urge everyone enough to make sure they make a stop there if they are in Vegas!! I promise you if there is line which there might be its worth the wait - you'll be happy you did!!!",

I think his name was randy..... I think he was Hawaiian or Filipino (so sorry if I got that wrong), I'm going to make sure I have him every time. This guy was attentive, nice, funny, and a stinking hard worker!  The outside looks like a business warehouse type of place but the inside is like a rustic but modern little Korean place. There was a wait but I think it was still before the dinner rush. This place is NOT ayce! We ordered 2 beef combos (feeds 3-4 each combo) for 6 grown adults. The grill isn't just a gas grill but they had wood chips in the fire, you can smell the wood and it does add a nice tone to the meat. The meat came out and my family is used to grilling everything ourself BUT the waiter was really attentive and did the cooking for us. They have these awesome napkin bibs to help you stay clean and probably helps keep you from smelling like Korean bbq. Bunch of sides. Meat was sooooooo tender. It's True you pay for the quality. The marinades were not overly sweet and was seasoned just right. Love the ice cream that comes on the rice cracker. Def will be coming back.",

It was more than just good, So we came back for lunch.  There's never a wait, It's all you can eat dishes! I'm just messing with you, Those are just some of my wishes.   Chopsticks as utensils,  but requested a fork. I stuck to the Angus,  because I don't do pork.  The servers cook the meats for you,  which is my favorite part. The options are simple,  Combos or ala carte  Go for the skirt steak, It's packed with flavor. Trust me when I say it, it's the best stuff ever.  You just can't go wrong here, Talk about quality meats. I hope you saved some room, for some desserts and sweets.   I prefer the green tea ice cream, and here's my take. It's an ice cream sandwich, made with a crispy rice cake.   Overall I recommend. That goes without saying. I'll end this rhyme now without delaying.   Hobak is new and hip,  maybe the greatest of all time. Good service, quality meats,  and worth every dime",

But besides the food, service was amazing, they cook the meat for you, and always attentive to our needs.   Also they give you rice cake ice cream, which is sweet but light after having a huge amount of meats.  But the only thing I didn't like about the restaurant, the whole restaurant would become so smoky, but that's just..my pet peeves about the BBQ restaurant.  But overall, it was great and delicious!",

As we walked in, I immediately notice how cute the ambience and decor was, it had a lot of character. Located in a corner spot near KFC and a nondescript business center. The industrial interior has been designed with props, posters, and artwork from the '80s and '90s.  There were few menu items, serving only beef and pork and concentrating on the quality of the ingredients.   The best part is they actually cook for you and the servers alternate if your original server is busy with something else. No need to worry about getting them burnt the servers will save you the trouble!  We ordered the Hobak Family Combo ($51.99 for Small, $84.99 for Large) - includes Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak, Hobak Aged Short Ribs, Angus Boneless Short Ribs, Grilled Spicy Pork Belly, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, and Rice  Amgus short rib meat was so juicy and tender.  Also the marinated skirt steak was tender and sweet.  The tables have electronic buttons built in so if you need service or want the check, just touch the button.   Their motto is \"sharing great things,\" they encourage groups to enjoy the charcoal and gas cooking experience.  My boyfriend and I definitely says it's 5 stars rating and would come back and also bring  our friends and visitors for a great Bbq experience.",

Was not a relaxing and enjoyable experience like we thought it would be for 7 of us work friends who gathered together post conference",

    "text": "The Hobak family has made it's way to Vegas baby! This is probably the best Korean BBQ in town with quality meats and awesome customer service. I felt my money was well spent.   da F.A.Q. ?? 1) Is this AYCE? No. 2) Will my clothes smell afterward? Yes.  3) Are the banchan refillable? Yes.  4) Do they cook it for you? Yes.  5) Is dessert included? Yes.   For two adults, I chose the $54.99 meal, the all beef one. It comes with three types of beef. We had: angus brisket, ribeye, and Hobak short ribs. It includes side dishes, rice, salad, steamed egg, soup, and dessert. We were plenty full with just enough room for dessert at the end.   The details matter. Our meat hosts cooked everything to perfection. Our angus ribeye was made to order at medium and some pieces cooked more well for the child. Even extra fatty and chewy parts were trimmed before they were served to us. Impressive. The grilled was changed without us needed to ask either.   The rice pop ice cream dessert was not like anything I have ever had. It looked like a dessert taco. Tilt your head to eat kind of thing. The crunchy rice exterior was fun. The red bean complimented the green tea ice cream well. Also available in vanilla ice cream!   Don't forget to cool off with some free slushies by the front door.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 34/100",

    "text": "NEWSFLASH: the Hobak bib will be THE Las Vegas fashion trend of 2016.  Soft, long, and dare I say...sleek; this immaculate garment says \"I'm ready to stuff my face full of meat while looking fierce! (attempts to make a hot face with mixed results)\"  During my 20 minute wait for an open table, I saw a large party exit while still wearing them.  They knew what was up!  Versace, Louis Vuitton and Tom Ford best take notice.  If the bibs came in different colors, silly carnivores like me would collect them all.   Unlike the lackluster service from another new KBBQ spot a few weeks ago, that is exactly what will keep me coming (ho)back here.  Our grillmeister was as genki as anyone I'd ever come across in a restaurant.  I liked the fact that she explained the menu clearly, took care of all the cooking, and pretty much did everything but put the food in my mouth, burp me when it was over and make me call her \"mommy\".  All with a smile!  Each employee had their own radio which helped expedite things greatly.  If we wanted more salad, she spoke softly into the microphone and \"bam!\" it arrived in a minute.  That was almost as impressive as their short rib.    Even with all that, I still wouldn't wait an hour plus for dinner here.  There isn't enough complimentary sugar slush (located to the right of the entrance) in the world that would convince me to.  Maybe if there were a bar next door or perhaps if they threw slithers of grilled pork belly to everyone waiting in the parking lot like they were seals?",

The dining area isn't that large, so it's understandable that there's usually a wait. The first thing you'll notice as you walk up is the smell -- that wonderful, aromatic smell of grilled meats. The inside gets smokey, too despite the vents directly above each grill.  The banchan, to start, was good and they kept it coming throughout our meal. Our group ordered two of the combo platters which was a good amount of food for everyone. The standouts for me were the spicy beef and skirt steak, but nothing disappointed. The quality of proteins was pretty impressive, overall, making this one of the better KBBQ spots I've tried.",

The restaurant looks just like the streets of Korea inside. The tables range from being rounded to rectangular, and pretty much every seat is good. They also have a vent that can be elongated, so not much smoke going to your face.  Service: amazing job, we basically had server all people constantly coming by to cook our food. They we're all working hard to make sure we had everything we need, and the meat was all cooked to perfection.  Food and drinks:  they have a variety of soju and beer. I tried their new soju which was strong but very delicious. They also have a lot of flavored soju and some where you can have them smack it and it becomes slushee like.   The meat here is probably the best quality Korean BBQ I have had. Everything is juicy and thick. You have the options to choose marinated meat also. Don't be afraid of the options are overwhelming, you can choose from the suggested list and the waiters do a very good job of describing the options and which would probably fit your taste. I also love all the side dishes here. I have been to some restaurants where they leave the side dishes on the table to dry out, but everything is fresh, tasty and really high quality.  Overall, best Korean BBQ restaurant in Vegas in my opinion. You will have a good time. The food is a bit more expensive than most Korean BBQ but it is a must try place!",

They actually cook for you and the servers alternate if your original server is busy with something else. Ever burnt your food or undercook it? No need to worry the servers will save you the trouble!  I recommend trying the Angus short rib the meat is so juicy and tender it feels and taste like butter YUM YUM. Also the marinated skirt steak is tender sweet and the meat just falls apart!   They have electronic buttons built into the table so if you need service or want the check its easily obtainable within a touch of a button.   Opening till 2 I think is happy hour so you get 10% off. I would definitely come back again for the meats!!! They have butchers in a see through that cut your meat as you order so it stays fresh.",

Took our names down and took about 10 minutes to sit us. While we are waiting we had free slushies ! Amazing ! We ordered the small beef combo for two people. Which I can say it was more than enough.   The steak was purely fresh and the the side dishes compliments our dinner very well. Not to mention the dessert in the end was worth it.

    "text": "Straight outta Korea. GUMBAE!!!!!!!!!!  My roomies have been here every week since it opened and I'm a little late to the game BUT, I have been here twice in a week. So, it's happening.   Food -- the marinade on the food is super bomb. Spicy isn't too spicy and super perfect sweet and saltiness. Lots of pork and beef dishes.  If there's one thing I wish they had, I wish it was gyutongue! It's my fave KBBQ meat!  Not the best place for veggie eaters although the banchan are bomb!!!  Banchan is next level. Some I've never tried before. The cold radish soup or whatever that is is new. I'm not sure whether to drink it but, I surely eat it. The kimchee is my favorite & I don't normally care for kimchee...prolly bcuz most places make it super spicy and hard to eat. Their kimchee is more vinegary than anything :)  Pancakes are great for the grill :)  Always get the corn cheese. Treat yourself.   Alcohol -- great price for each soju bottle. Gotta try that peach soju.   Atmosphere -- inside feels like you're eating outside lol maybe some street vendor in another country? Grill is the best. They change out the grill often depending on what's the best way to cook the meat. They have a GREAT way of sucking up the grill smoke, too. Adjustable for the workers to do their job yet, just enough to stop the smoke from heading your way.   Workers -- super friendly and on it with whatever your heart desires. You want the sesame oil, you got it. You want more banchan, you got it. There's the buttons on the side for you to press if you need service, your check, or etc!   Price -- not all you can eat but, way RIDICULOUSLY reasonable. Last night 8 of my friends and I ordered couple large combos and a small one. Few bottles of soju and cheese corn. And our bill was less that $300; hence around $35 each. CRAZY CHEAP!!! Especially since we were all so stuffed and had some leftovers!   It's so scary how OBSESSED I am with this place. My waistline hates me! lol",

    "text": "I don't know if people are calling this the best Korean BBQ in town, but it very likely is.  Hobak Korean BBQ is a fairly new restaurant on Spring Mountain (between Lindell and Jones) that's actually located in an otherwise commercial building/plaza. Its facade only directly displays its name in Korean symbols, but you can see the English name on the big plaza sign at the side of the road.  I was forewarned to come early to avoid the dinner rush, and I lucked into an invite to a group of 5 at 5 pm. Those who end up having to wait will find complimentary beverages (water bottles in a cart outside the restaurant, sweet slushes in dispensers inside), both of which are welcome in the Vegas summer.  Meat is clearly the core of the experience, and we made the centerpiece of our meal the $89.99 large size Hobak Beef Combo ($54.99 for small). I'm not sure whether it's the unlikely phenomenon that \"black angus\" is finally no longer a buzzword or that they have fresh-not-frozen meat, but every piece of meat was well-marbled and (probably as a result) incredibly delicious. I'm sure that the charcoal cubes in the base of the grill also helped lend that extra smoky touch to everything.  The first meat was beef brisket, and I've never had any of it before with that much flavor. The sushi rice w/ wasabi actually made it even better. It went well with the onion sauce too. Next came the boneless short ribs, which my friend said should be paired with the sesame oil. It was great. I think we actually got both marinated skirt steak and aged short ribs (the latter two with sufficient flavor on their own), and those were also fantastic. Even the cartilage off the short ribs was a wonderfully fatty (albeit very chew-resistant) mouth experience. Start to finish, this was beef heaven.  Some of us wanted to try their pork belly a la carte ($21.99), so we added it to the tail end of the meal. It was pretty great, but it had been dwarfed by the excellent beef. I'm told that the pork options in general don't measure up, so I'll be more than happy to stick to the Hobak Beef Combo next time.  Speaking of which, I didn't even finish describing the several other items that are included in the combo. The bean paste stew was unfamiliar to me, but it was tasty. The steamed egg was my favorite yet, and it didn't have conspicuously burnt edges (where it contacts the stone bowl). The veggies seemed like an afterthought in portion (shareable for 4? nah), but they were good. The melted cheese merely needed some tortilla chips for the full nacho effect, and it just felt out of place. The rice pop ice cream is actually some of the better ice cream sandwiches that I've had, with a light crispy shell glued by red bean puree to vanilla (w/ strawberry syrup) and green tea (w/ chocolate syrup).  The various side dishes (banchan) were also good. Kimchi, a couple salads, and various pickled items worked on their own and sometimes in combination with the meats. [EDIT: Incomplete sentence/thought, what the heck? Well, I'll add that they'll gladly refill the banchan for you, so feel free to ask!]  Finally, we also shared some other dishes. The bi-bim bab (aka rice box, $7.99) was a great mix that included spam and eggs, although I'm told it also doesn't measure up to the best that LA's KBBQ scene has to offer. The spicy buckwheat noodles with vegetables ($9.99) impressed me more than the faint memory that I have of the soba from a long-ago visit to a formerly trendy Japanese spot nearby (spoiler alert: it was I-Naba).  I can't let it go unmentioned that service is great. Did I mention that they cook the meats for you? Well, they cook the meats for you. It's about as close to being spoon-fed as a baby that you can get to sitting back and enjoying. Each table actually has a four-button device for requesting different types of service (order, check, service, cancel), but we never even had to use it. Decor was nice too, with elements reminiscent of other popular local Korean restaurants, although I was mostly focused on the food. I will say that the metal chopsticks and water cups felt nice to hold; they had real heft to them unlike at some places.  My next visit to Hobak Korean BBQ can't come soon enough. It really is a beefivore's paradise, and all but the most ravenous should be able to escape with an excellent, reasonably portioned dinner in the $30-40 ballpark. Especially if you take advantage of free corkage.",

The taste of the chop chae was not as good as it was on previous visits. The meats were still better in quality than other K-Bbq restaurants. I like the eclectic vibe in here until the lady staff was trying to have us hurry because they want to turn your table for more customers. They think they are clever, but it was so obvious. After spending $96 for 2 people and a $20 tip that was taken by the rude cashier/waitress from the table before we left, I felt it was unprofessional. It killed our experience. I have been more than tolerable on previous visits when they had a shortage of staff so I did not appreciate this visit, but it's okay because there are lots of K-Bbq places. Anthony was the only professional staff here, but he was the helper and not a waiter. The main servers should take a lesson or two from him on how to treat customers and deliver a perfect experience.",

Hands down better than Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong in LA  -----------------------------------  We got the family style meal and it came with various different meats.  I think overall all of the meats and marinades were legit, but overall by far the pork cuts were the most flavorful.  I wished they had served the non-marinated meats first and then the marinated ones, but all was exceptional.  The atmosphere is similar to Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, but this place has way better meat, less cramped, service is good, and THERE'S NO WAIT!  Literally you could drive from LA to Vegas and get here in less time than it would take if you waited at Kang Ho.  Ventilation was legit, with the vent able to move lower onto the grill.",

We came back the next day at around five-ish and there was no wait at all.  We had 2 adults and 1 child who can eat like an adult and we ordered the family dinner option 1 for $58.99 meant for 2.  Everything was delicious and we were stuffed!  It rounds out like $20 per person which is a steal for Korean BBQ.  The meats were fresh, well-marinated and tasty. I liked the brisket and skirt steak the most. Pork belly and pork ribs were also delicious!  The best part was that somebody was there to cook it for you and you don't have to Lift a finger to cook yourself! Impeccable service and the endless banchan refills were awesome. They didn't give us the fish cake in the first round - we asked if they have it and surprisingly they did and they brought it out from the kitchen. Yay!   Ice cream sandwich at the end which rounded up this nice meal and experience at this restaurant.  Beyond the great food and service, one thing to add is that this restaurant goes out of their way to please the customers!  - water mist and benches outside the restaurant while you wait  - offers free fruit punch to drink while you wait - dedicated server to help you cook the food - offers refreshing mouthwash in the bathroom to rinse your mouth after the meal  Way to go!! Recommend!",

They switched servers half way through and we had no idea what was going on after that until Helena returned.

Rice cake ice cream sandwiches for dessert was so amaze balls we tried the green tea this time.They even have Hawaiian Punch and green apple slushies!

I love learning about food when dining out. And this place has taught me about cooking pork rib meat quickly (can wait to replicate this dish)  Service was attentive and right on.  Free desert ice cream sandwich?  What could be better?   Yes a $25 shot of blue label scotch--in Vegas!!!  Not a long trip off strip.  Will definitely return!!!!",

Very different from other Korean barbecue places. This place is great even though it is not ALL you can eat the portion that they give you is a great amount in there combos of the restaurant. The choices of meats they prep very well and taste very delicious . I would say they great quality of meat. The other great thing about this place is the customer service. The servers and bussers are all kind. The server that served us was a guy name \" Matthew \" and he gave the best customer service we ever seen. He was very respectful and very nice. He took the time to explain the side dishes and explain each meat that he was cooking for us. He is great server. I would like everyone to check this place out because this place is great experience if you are trying to find something different in Korean barbecue. 10/10 I recommend. Great food and great atmosphere.",

Meat is superb, great portions and superb quality. Big fan of un-marinated meats and the brisket is to die for. Service was outstanding, can't stress that enough. The rice pop ice cream was different but very tasty.   It is definitely up there with the heavy hitters in Koreatown LA. This place will do good and I will be a regular for sure. Cheers",

Upon being seated, our waiter took his time getting to us for drinks. We quickly placed our order with him, and this is where it got ridiculous. It took nearly 45 minutes for us tp get the meats we ordered. 45 minutes to get raw meat on a platter.  The waiter proceeded to overcook our steak as he ran around to other tables to do the same. To top things off, we weren't offered desserts and had to remind the waiter of it.  My hope is that was a one-off. I think we'll give it another try, though based on this experience, optimism isn't as high as before.",

Now that I have moved to Henderson, last night was the first time I and my brother had dinner there again in a while. And yet it still impressed us just like our very first time.  We went there around 6pm Tuesday and the restaurant was already packed. Luckily the line went pretty quickly and we got to order our food and served some side dishes right away.  I am particularly impressed with the staff working there. They were all super fast, friendly and efficient. There were at least 3 people rotating to grill our meat so we always had meat ready to eat back to back. Also, All the side dish refills were as fast as lighting and they came out super fresh not in a rushed way.  As for food, we ordered the Family Combo 3 which had both beef and pork. All the meats were extremely tender and flavorful and not salty at all. Definitely one of the most well marinated meats I've ever had in a Korean BBQ restaurant! The quality of the meat is superior to other restaurants for sure, which explains why their price is a bit higher than 'market' price, but totally worth every penny.(After splitting the bill, we paid roughly $40 per person for our meal) With all that being said, highly recommend this place for a casual hangout, night out with friends or family. Just not a place for a dressy or formal event because there's a high chance you'll walk out with a smoky smell on your clothes :)",

It is suppose to be a full service bbq, where server cooks the meat for you, but our server went on break and our new server simply forgot about us. We sat there waiting for him to get the new grill and put our meat on. Told the server about the birthday, but didnt get the usual kbbq birthday song and celebration. Saw another table get this with sparker candles while we were being seated. We were able to wave down a women server who gave us some helpful attention even though we were not her table. The portions on the large beef combo is way too small. It is more appropriate for a party of 2 to 3. I get we are suppose to pay premium for premium meat, but my taste buds and belly strongly disagreed. The angus beef fried rice had maybe 3 pieces of meat, rice was undercooked, and was so salty. Cold noodles were okay. Marinated short ribs were flaky and weird. Seemed like a batch of old meat that was overmarinated to compensate for the bad meat. This place is as expensive if not more than Baekjung in ktown LA. I can tell they are modeled after them in terms of service style, decor, grill setup, and etc, but they fall short in many apects.",

Anyhow, when we went in at 6:30 on a Friday on New Years weekend they told us it'd be an hour wait. They actually made sure that it'd be an hour, and it was an hour exactly. I was impressed at how they did that haha. But we got seated right away and the side dishes and water etc were already at the table waiting for us.  I love EVERYTHING about Hobak but I really just wanna share the important things here:  1. The 5 of us shared the Large beef combo and it was actually PLENTY. Like, we were all hella full by the end. So worth.  2. Our table fave was aged short ribs. It was the last thing served so we were already filling up but it was So Unforgettable that it's just.. our fave. Pls get that.   3. We also love the potato pancake side. They refilled at least 4x on that haha. All their sides were yummy anyway.  4. 5 bowls of rice came with our combo? Idk if that's a standard or depends on the # of ppl.  5. There's no corkage fee but when u r there I suggest u get one of those cocktail soju to share. For the full experience ;)   6. They have like mouthwash and single use toothbrush kits in there.. talk about customer service   Again, I don't wanna talk about every single thing here but I just wanna reassure you that everything was AWESOME! You should also take advantage of the whole friendly ambient - HAVE FUN! We were so excited about our food that evrytime a dish comes out or they put meat on the table we HYPE the F up. No kidding. Almost obnoxious but as long as we are not bothering other people right ;)   I can't wait to come back soon for Hobak, not to see my friends but really to go to Hobak. Love u.",

Just wish the quality got back to where it was. Will still go back, but just not as often as we used to.",

Inside it has a feel that you are in Korea.   Inside how its designed its like your in a korean village but your inside of a building.   They have street lights and different sections of the restaurant to look like buildings.     We got the small combo meal (way big enough for two people) off the menu and you get two choices from two parts of the menu.   We got angus short rib and aged short rib.   On top of the meat you get the small side dishes, a bean paste stew, steamed egg, vegetables, cheddar cheese, and a rice pop icecream.    If you get the ribs you also get 6 rice balls with wasabi.  You put the wasabi on top of the rice and the meat on top and then dip the rice ball in you sauce.    This was so good.     The meat was flavorful and tender.   Our waiter I can't remember his name but our receipt said his name was \"Tu\".   He was awesome and super attentive to our table.  You couldn't ask for better service.    And at the end we got our rice pop icecream.  The only downfall is that you can only pick one flavor to share per every two people because it's huge and cut in half to share between each other.  We got strawberry.   But they have vanilla, mint and cookies-n-cream.  They had some more flavors but I can't remember what they were.  I would definitely be back.",

Don't get me wrong, the meat cuts are still good, but one of the benefits of coming here is the servers cook your food.  Haelee was our server and eek, her timing for cooking and concern for health is non-existent.  Usually, the food is cooked one meat at a time and when you are finished, they put the next meat on the grill.  I'm not sure what her deal was but I swear she cooked all of our combo meats in 15 minutes.  Not only that, I'm clearly pregnant and she had raw meat touching our cooked meat multiple times.  I called her out the first time I saw the raw meat touch and then she proceeded to recook the meat that touched the raw meat.  But she kept repeating the same thing, allowing the raw meat to touch the cooked meat.   Uh, ever heard of food safety.... I know it was a busy night, but next time I will say please wait until we are done before you cook the second meat.  We were trying to eat as quickly as possibly, but because there was so much cooked meat sitting off to the side, the meat was cold =(  And then, while the meat was still cooking, they asked us what dessert we wanted.  I pretty much had to say, hey can we enjoy our meat first before we order dessert.  Management needs to get the staff trained on food handling...wouldn't want the health district paying a visit and seeing servers like yours trying to poison customers.  I might stop being lazy and just cook my own meat and go to Master Kim's....",

Despite the fact we waited for almost an hour....it was worth the wait!! +Absolutely love the atmosphere of the restaurant, kinda reminded me of that go-to place in Kdramas where the heartbroken character goes to drink their sorrows away.  +the soju options!! (top faves are the grapefruit & peach) ASK FOR FROZEN so they can use the hammer. You'll thank me later. +family meal options. If you're dining with a larger group, why not. Ordered the #1: half pork half beef  Great service & they cook for you, what's not to love. Everyone is stopping by to see if you need anything refilled or extras (cause how do you saw no to banchan)  Oh & if it's your birthday, they play a different soundtrack and your dessert with a firecracker flare...it's awesome :)   Hands down would recommend this place. Spicy foods actually meant spicy and the meats were tender/flavorful. Definitely have to visit again to see some lunch special options.",

But no fear, the good food will fill you up!  Decor: Pretty spacious with hipster vibe; the retractable exhaust fan is interesting and kept the smoke in check.  Service was pretty good when we went, and it was nice that the server cooked for you so all we had to do is eat, refill, and eat some more. They have a stool when ladies can put their belonging inside to safeguard  Food: HOBAK FAMILY COMBO $54.99 for 2 people: include marinated skirt steak, aged short ribs, pork ribs, pork belly, bean paste stew, steam egg, banchan, and rice pop ice cream; realistic, there's enough for 3 people especially if you order another item; combo also come with a plate of sushi rice that you can add wasabi to pair with bbq  TOFU SOUP - $8.99, literally tofu in semi spicy broth with sliced squash - don't mistake this with soontofu  ANGUS FRIED RICE $8.99: tasty fillers  RICE POP ICE CREAM $3.99: so deliciously light yet creamy; the crispy rice pop cracker pairs well with the green tea ice cream; would come here just to order this dessert  Delicious banchans - pancake (yum), white radish (refreshing), kimchee, ben sprouts, salad (meh), seasoned radish  Definitely worth coming back, and they need to open one in Orange County!",

Some people stray from this place because it's not AYCE kbbq like everywhere else is. But the quality of their meats is sooooooo much more worth it than other places. I originally came to this place to try the spicy cold noodle which is by far the best I've had in Vegas. I normally get combo #3 just because it's a variety of beef. Their hot sauce is amazing and really spicy. If extreme spice isn't your thing, then it's definitely not for you. Nana is definitely helpful and funny. When we first visited she explained to us the menu and she also showed us how to eat kbbq properly. I'm always laughing at her because she seems so intense when she's cooking the food for you but she got jokes. The chemistry of the team working here is amazing considering they rotate and nothing is ever wanted without immediate attention. Just make sure you come here ready to wait as I've never been here when it's not busy. Other than that, enjoy the food, enjoy the vibe, and enjoy the food coma.",

But this one has the best quality meats combined with perfectly salty and delicious marinades and sauces. Even the red bean soup was well above par. My only compliant would be that they do not offer lettuce wraps, which is my favourite way of eating Korean BBQ. However, having said that, the meat is so amazing on it's own, it would almost be a shame to hide it amongst the lettuce.  What I had never seen before was the addition of sushi rice with wasabi as a rice option,  instead of the more common side bowl. I was missing a couple of the more interesting Banchan, but all that were included were super tasty. We have had multiple people assisting our table and cooking our meats for us (yet another cut above other KBBQ joints), and they are all very nice and attentive.   Highly recommend to anyone wanting to branch out from the AYCE style of Korean barbecue.",

Had a bout a 25 minute wait for a table but it was well worth it. They are a little atypical as they do not set out 20 plates of bichon on your table.  The choices are a little limited but very tasty. We ordered a #2 combo which came with brisket, pork belly,outside skirt and spicy pork jowl. All the meats were good quality and the servers made sure they were all cooked to our liking. Definitely my new go to for Korean bbq.  3 people who got full for about $165 including drinks and tip.  Not too shabby.  Go check them out.  But be warned  No Reservations.",

All the servers pretty much took turns helping and cooking for every table. You can definitely tell the quality of the meat they serve. Also, they provide toothbrushes and mouthwash in the restroom so that you can hit the club fresh again.   And OMG, the meats are superb I almost wished I have two stomachs. And they change the grills after each meats so you really get the full taste of the meat. The price is reasonable and I will definitely come back again!",

Ordered the family meal for two and here are some of the downsides:  1. Condiments were not very tasty, except for the seaweed salad and the picked radish.  Bean soup and steamed egg were meh. 2. They cook for you and different people like things done differently, for example charring of the meat while still being medium rare inside, others like things rare, this is impossible to do if someone is doing the cooking and controlling heat. 3. They provide cold sushi rice but no hot rice to go with your grilled meats (what?) 4. They don't provide romaine lettuce leaves to eat your grilled meats with (another what?)  Just kind of an awkward experience and these family meals for two are in the $64-$66 price range and should be closer to $45. Won't be back.  We've got much better in the Bay Area and Southern Cal areas.",

    "text": "Not your average Korean BBQ restaurant.  Environment: The restaurant itself may be a little hard to locate just when driving by but once you park in the plaza the outside has a nice waiting area with some spots to sit and misters to ease the heat. Upon entering the restaurant is somewhat large and very open, with a variety of seating. The interior decorating is nice and trendy with the walls having amusing murals and structures placed to give the restaurant a more authentic feel. The music is at a respectable volume not being drowned out but not too loud where you can't hear the conversation you are having at your table.  Food: When dining here, typically the best option is to go with one of the pre-determined sets of meats. They have multiple options with each option having different meats included and for varying amounts of people. The side dishes they give you start are great and taste very fresh. There are two different salads, a cold soup, a hot bean paste soup, and a steamed egg all which are given in addition to the typical side dishes that are standard for Korean restaurants. All the meat they serve is very fresh and flavorful and I like how they bring different sides for the different meats. Some come with a cheese fondue, others come with sides of sushi rice and wasabi and they all pair perfectly. You are also given complimentary dessert (which I believe was some type of macaroon). Additionally, their drink menu is very good too. They have various flavors of soju which are served pleasingly cold, and if you ask they can serve it as a slush.   Service: Service is above average for a KBBQ restaurant in my opinion. Servers are very good about checking on you as well as aiding with the cooking of your meat, regardless of whether they are your assigned server or not. Also, they are good at giving recommendations and promoting their new items. Our server told us about a new sake which they have recently got and really sold it to us and we were pleasantly surprised.   Overall, Hobak is a nice break from the ubiquitous all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurants in Las Vegas, which I love as well, but sometimes its nicer to hang out and talk and drink over some quality meat.",

The aged short rib is probably the best marinated beef I've ever had at a Korean BBQ. Service was good.   The Bad: The side dishes. It was nice to get korean pancake, but I wish I could've had some potato, or broccoli, or fishcake, or tofu. Also, the kimchi was not spicy at all. We asked if they had spicier kimchi, and they said, \"No.\"   Verdict: Definitely worth trying.",

This was by far the best part of this meal (even better than the marinated cuts). The restaurant  is quite an experience with the cooking done at the table and such high quality meat compared to the other korean bbq places in town.  A star knocked down for:  No bulgogi! Kind of shocking not to serve this staple of korean cuisine.  The place is unnecessarily noisy, with crummy pop music blasting incessantly.   If you are seated along the right side wall as you walk in, you will be hit by the frigid AC, so much so that a woman sitting at the next table had to move to the other side.  The banchan was forgettable, as others have pointed out.  Not a good place for kids. Meat took too long to come out and had to ask for more rice again and again.  Tables are too small for 4 people with all of the small dishes, cups and bowls, soup, etc. A bit cumbersome, and detracts from the experience.   I'll go back...but just for that brisket.",

Everything tasted great including the small dishes on the table, we especially love the salad and pancake, keep in mind you can ask for refill of those dishes. The only thing we didn't enjoyed right there and then was the pork belly, it was too fatty for us, we took it home and my wife recook it, it tasted great!   Expect a wait, 45 minute to an hour. Expect your clothes and hair to be smelly afterwards. The price is fair, but definitely not a bargain. I would recommend here for anyone whom have not tried it yet, but I don't think I would come back anytime soon.",

My cousin and i shared the kbbq with pork and beef for a little over $50... Meant to feed two people, but it was more than enough. It could feed three or four people. The food takes the cake. The staff bbqs it for u which i like better than traditional kbbq. Food was amazing.. Seriously everything was good on our plate. The atmosphere feels like youre in south korea. And the bathroom has free toothpaste and toothbrushes and mouthwash lol to get rid of that kbbq breath. Hobak wont disappoint. Go!!!!",

I went around 9PM on a Friday night and almost every table was occupied. We were seated within 10 minutes and the servers were so attentive. I didn't have to flag down a server for more banchan/side dishes or ask multiple times, they radio it over to someone who is able to complete the request and it dishes are refilled quickly and efficiently. The plus side of someone else cooking for you, is seemingly less residual \"meat smell/smoke\" lingering on your clothes. Our server explained each meat and the best sauce/dip that would pair with it. I love that the meats are delicious non marinated but the marinated meats aren't too overwhelming or overly seasoned (too sweet or salty) and they have clean flavors. I would highly recommend trying this place!",

    "text": "Great communication with all of the servers. Had great service throughout our dining and the food was delicious. We chose the beef selection and was able to had a great meal in what seemed like a 1960s sort of themed Korean bbq restaurant. The servers have sneeze guard masks which is very nice to have that assurance of cleanliness while they cook your food and also their communication with their walkie talkies allows for faster food service which was helpful in our meal experience. The restroom was kept fairly clean and also offered service toothbrushes and mouth wash to rid of the food odor after eating. The one complaint I had was when our pajeon was set up with the other side dishes at our table before we sat down was cold. I thought it was possibly served cold but when we asked for other rounds of side dishes it was then served hot. Also I highly recommend that you do not try their slushy machine for it isn't mixed right and tastes pretty horrible. Overall this was a great experience. The start and finish to our dining is what lost the star. 4/5 but will def come back when I visit Vegas again.",

I only assumed they had an evening flight to Korea....always a good sign. We were told it would be a 30 - 40 min wait and it was.  We arrived at 6:45 on a Sat. They do have outside seating with misters and free cold slushies of some sort to drink (self serve by the reception). We had 4 people and ordered the combo 3 platter with a side of spicy rice.  OMG is was the BEST Korean BBQ I have had outside of Korea. They cook everything for you. My table liked their meat cooked less than I do and that was just fine. The desert comes with the combo and was excellent. If you are on a low carb high protein diet this is a great spot. Just don't eat the rice, etc and order more greens.  Definitely on my LIST. Just prepared to wait a bit.",

We've tried so many different places and we both agreed that the food and service here is top notch.   My high school classmate was coming to town and wanted to have korean bbq, so of course we took them here and no one was disappointed. We ordered the set menu and it comes with everything. My only suggestion is more side dishes of assorted kimchee.   I love the concept of having the taste of charcoal when you barbeque. The meat is very tender and well seasoned.   Another must try is their dessert. It's the typical green tea and red bean ice cream but with their own twist to it.",

My friend and I came here today after a day of cigar and bourbon shopping. We were both starving!! Came in and the hostess said it was a 20 minute wait, but we got seated in 10 minutes or less.   We got the large beef combo, because we were starving!! We got brisket, boneless short rib, aged short rib, and rib eye. All of the meats melted in my mouth!! Everything was super tender and juicy.   The thinly sliced brisket with the sushi rice was so good. First time I've ever had it this way and I like it!! The ribeye was beautifully fatty and it was as juicy as could be. The boneless and aged short ribs were so so so so good. I can't express how good the short ribs are. You just have to try them and enjoy for yourself. Best KBBQ place in town hands down!!!!!   I will be back with my parents for sure.",

There were 3 couples and the girls had their own table next to the guys and that was definitely a good idea because each table ordered the family dinner combo which was enough food for us all. The best meat I tried would have to be the steak! They cook the meats one at a time and will bring you sides as you ask for them. They asked if we wanted rice closer to the end of the meal, which I thought was odd, but I didn't mind because I was already getting full from the delicious meat and side dishes. They also give you two different salads, stew, and steamed egg. There was plenty of food and everything was flavorful! I love that they had the cheese in the cup and had us try dipping the meat in there. The pull-down air vent did a great job sucking up the smoke from the grill.  After the meal, they ask if you would like green tea or vanilla ice cream- we went with green tea and it was made like a ice cream sandwich using rice crackers and had  chocolate drizzle on the inside. They were to die for!   Overall, I wish Utah had this restaurant with their urban decor and amazing food! I just want to drive 6 hours to eat here again!   Bonus: Free slushee drinks at the entrance!",

Over cooked the beef brisket, left the cheese on the side, never used the beef fat to start the cooking, and the overall service was just bad. The busser reset the table right next to me, THREW everything into a bus tub, and there was still dirty chopstick and paper on the floor. The runner presented an extra tofu soup that we never asked for and took away the steamed egg that I haven't finished.... BUT.. The server Nana showed up and checked on the table. She cooked the last course for us. She apologized for our bad experience and really made an effort to change it. This would have been a 1 star review but Nana just saved the night!",

    "text": "Hobak is def now my favorite Korean BBQ spot in town! The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool. It reminds me of a night market but trendy and modern. The place is super clean and organized. The customer service is so helpful. They are there to watch out for your meats and will cook the meats for you if you don't want to cook it yourself. Mind you, traditionally Korean BBQ is served all you can eat but this place is not. However, their family options was enough!  We ordered the Hobak Family Combo 3 for 2 people ($54.99). Man was that enough food!  It comes with Marinated skirt steak, Spicy angus short rib, Aged Short Ribs, and your choice of pork belly or aged pork rib. We got the pork belly. Everything was amazing and so flavorful. And the staff cooked our meat to perfection. Also, the combo comes with dessert (rice cracker with ice-cream with chocolate) Amazing... and 1 free rice per person. Additional cost for rice after that. They do also serve the traditional small plate appetizers, egg, and soup.   Will be going back soon!",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review because I just can't let you know, who are interested to try Hobak how good this place is. We came in and was told that they'll set up the table. Waited for around 5 minutes, that was a Saturday aternoon. When we get to the table I was taken aback, the table was literally set up. The bancha was already there, water, cups, together with all the things we'll use. That is good, because sometimes in some restaurants it gets awkward and inconvenient when they will start fixing you're table when you're already sitting there. Passing this and that, moving things around. So, this style is a plus for me.  Food: We ordered Family combo and premium pork belly. It was fantastic, you might think it's the same with other KBBQ, it's all bbq. But the difference here is they used coal vs the stove grilling in other KBBQ places I've been. It added flavor. The beanpaste stew was also flavorful, loved it. The kimchi is hot, good hot. Lastly, included in the combo is the rice pop ice cream, I picked green matcha. Delicious, like an ice cream sandwhich, but the shell is crispy.  Service: They were friendly, professionals. Accomodating and they cooked for us! Nice and warm people.   Place: Beautiful, I like their style. Cool, hip and modern. And check out the restrooms :) They have free toothbrushes and mouthwash.",

One order consisted of two slabs.  The meat was moist, tender, and flavored perfectly.  Although, some pieces were fatty, but credit goes to the meatless bone.  Some Korean restaurants leave fat and meat on the bone, but this restaurant attempts to cut down as much meat off the bone as possible.  Accompanying the meat order is the traditional bean soup, house salad, scallion salad and steam egg.  Great, all around accompaniments.    Ice cream dessert; a traditional, but not so traditional flare.  Refreshingly cool, cookies and cream (other flavors available)ice cream, wedged between the not so traditional Buntigi and red beans.  It worked.  A definite Korean spin.",

I'm not going to lie it was kind of awkward because they cook the food for you while you just sit there and wait till it's done. None the less it was a great experience. The price wasn't bad, I got the 3-4 people combo and we got about 4 different meats along with the side dishes and ice cream at the ends. Will for sure come here again, it was my first time",

This location they cook it for you in front of you, no need for you to have to watch the meat and flip anything.  The meat was a little fatty for me but everything was great no real complaints.   The bathrooms are interesting here.  They have Toothbrushes, Toothpaste & mouthwash.  And it sounded like they had Rosetta Stone playing teaching you how to pronounce American Words in Korean.",

    "text": "We have been to Hobak several times, both by ourselves and with friends.  The reviews are always the same...AWESOME.  This time we brought a friend with our family (lunch on 6/27/19.)  The beef and pork are very tasty and of very good quality every time.  That's what I like about this place.  It is very consistent.  Not only with the food, but also with the service and the servers.  Always greeted at the door, and our wait has been very short each time.  This place gets very busy, so do expect to wait for seating.  The only thing we order is the combo dishes.  For our group(s), it is always the way to go, and we have never left still hungry.  For us, the winner is Set 3.  The taste is always good, and like I mentioned, consistent every time we have been.  We especially like the salt mixture that they provide.  The side dishes are ok.  For me, meh as far as taste.  It does seem very authentic though.  The dessert, if you have room, is a great ice cream/rice krispy sandwich.  It is light and just right to finish off the meal.  We always order rice bowls and extra sides that we do like, which are all free or included with the combos.  The large runs us $103.99 plus tip.  This time, our server was Boddens.  HANDS DOWN, THE BEST TABLE COOK!  We have been coming for years, and this was the first time ever our last selection (spicy pork with the potatoes and carrots) was done to perfection.  Really, the whole meal was cooked to perfection.  I have to admit, most times the temperature of the meats are not cooked to my liking, but this time....AWESOME!  Boddens is the man!  The one kinda cool, and at the same time odd thing, is that you can brush your teeth after the meal (in the restrooms.)  Hygiene items provided.  Would definitely recommend, and will of course be back soon!",

The steamed egg and soup were light and tasty.  Now for the heart of the matter the skirt steak was okay - the rib eye was a beautiful piece of meat by sight I could tell it was very tender and well marbled - it was sacrilege to destroy such a nice piece of meat! After scissor cut into bite size - I knew from years of cooking that the fire was too hot - flambe may he dramatic BUT the burnt oil taste ruined the meat and the experience- 3hours later I could still taste that rancid flavor. The aged ribs were tasty but overshadowed by that nasty burnt oil taste.  The  dessert of ice cream sandwich with puffed rice cracker was inspired.  The indoor fire works for birthdays was cute.  Next time I may give one more chance at lunch - hopefully you cannot mess up bulgogi",

As soon as you get seated, they start putting down the side dishes and a server came over and greets you. We ordered their corn cheese, family combo #1, and grapefruit soju. Let me start by saying that family combo (small) is ALLOT of meat. They say small is enough for two but for us it served between four people! All the meats was excellent! No bad smell to the meat, meats was marinated well, and everything was so soft. Family combo came with steamed eggs, soup and ice cream for dessert. Soup was not my favorite but the steamed eggs were good. Side dishes was alright as they were not my favorite besides kimchi. I definitely love the pork belly and the spicy beef.   Corn cheese was so good! The sweetness from the corn mixed in with mozzarella cheese is perfect! Ice cream was soooo good. Too bad they didn't have green tea, vanilla will do.   Oscar was mainly our server and he did such an amazing job! But everyone who stopped by a little were just as awesome. I will definitely be back!!",

We had family in town and decided to try this place out, however since we had never dined here before we did not know what to expect, but in reading all the great reviews thought it would be a good first for us all.  We had the combo number three which is all the marinated meat selection, three beef and one pork cut. We were NOT disappointed.  First thing I noticed was the quality of meat was really good and let me say the taste of each meat selection was AMAZING!   My mouth is watering as I write this review.  Best of all they cook it for you and everything stays nice and hot. The banchan (side dishes) are also wonderful and as with most Korean places you can order as many of these as you please.  The grill was another impressive part of our meal. We did not come out smelling like smoke, yeah!   The service was inviting and warm! We had several different staff members at our table and all were informative and offered some of the best service with a smile!   I am looking forward to returning here again and again! Don't change a thing!",

I went through my yelp bookmarks like 10 times until I finally stopped on \"hobak Korean BBQ\". Once we got there, we were seated right away. The place got packed pretty fast, considering it's Monday, I say it's a sign of success lol we ordered marinated aged short ribs, rice, beer, coke, and whatever comes with the meat. Everything was delicious! They brought bean paste soup, steamed egg, and bunch of small apps - the usual for Korean BBQ. Quality of everything was really good - fresh and flavorful. The meat was soooooo tender, it melted in my mouth. We absolutely loved everything. The entire time, our waitress along with the other staff, checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed, we were happy with the food, which we were very much. After dinner, we ordered rice crispy ice cream - soooo delicious. The only thing that kinda left a negative mark were hostesses - both the blonde and the brunette. Unlike the rest of the staff, they were not friendly, not welcoming, never smiled, and they kept rushing us to pay our bill (which we didn't even ask for) so they could clear our table for next guests. They were snobby, I don't know what their deal is honestly. Other than that, a fantastic spot! The food and service were amazing and I know for a fact that I'll be back.  P. S. Please train your hostesses, we felt like we were being kicked out. I don't want to experience it again",

They sat us at a BBQ table after we said we just want to each the lunch specials, which seemed to irritate them. We ordered bulgogi, the server came back and said they only have enough bulgogi til 3pm (it was 12:15) that didn't make sense. So they only got us 3 orders of bulgogi. 2 were OK the 3rd was not the correct dish. It was spicy pork belly mixed with bulgogi. We didn't order that and they would not switch it out. The managers seemed irritated we were there. The lady taking our payment even said they messed up and still did not take it off our check. With all the other better options in Las Vegas, this place should be the absolute last resort. There are plenty of other K-BBQ restaurants With better selection, atmosphere and prices than this place. Won't come back.   More info:  I ordered 2 bulgogi with no spice and 1 with spice. After they clearly brought out spicy pork belly and had the nerve to charge me for spicy pork belly after the fact.  I uploaded the receipt as proof.",

I typically get the family combo number 1. Hobak was one of the very first in Vegas where servers bbq the meat for you. So it does have the customer service and atmosphere going for it. In terms of the food let's see. I wanna say their steamed egg is vastly underrated, it has the perfect level of fluffiness. Their salad is a decent mix and their desert (looks like an green tea ice cream sandwich) is more special than most. Their meat...hmmm...I mean the pork belly and pork ribs nothing out of the ordinary. I do think their beef brisket is better than most Korean bbq joints, less frozen and prepared better. And their beef ribs has amazing quality because of the way it detached from the bone. I would come back but probably with my tourist friends who seem to be more impressed with theatrics than food lol.",

The beef cuts were excellent, but the spicy pork texture was kind of grainy, however the flavor was good. Next time we will opt for all beef cuts. The combo comes with soup, steamed egg and a very small portion of rice which is molded into small shapes of balls like you would eat nigiri. Not too many side dishes like you would see at an ACYE but all are refillable.   Don't forget to save room for dessert! It comes with the combos and they cut it for us in 3 servings which was the perfect portion. We opted for strawberry and the texture and flavor of the ice cream sandwiched between a thin, crispy wafer and whatever spread they used was fabulous.",

Wait staff very helpful and cooked all the dishes for us. The meats we ordered in a combination plate were brisket, skirt steak, seasoned pork jowl, and pork belly... the seasoned pork jowl was fatty and really tasty.  The combo came with soup and dessert. The food was good, no complaints but besides the pork jowl, you can get the other stuff at other Korean BBQ places. When ordered individually, it can be pricey so I recommend getting the combination plates. Their dessert was delicious with the ice cream placed between what tasted like wafers... Really good.

    "text": "Hands down the best KBBQ in Vegas!!!! For the longest time, I didn't really like many of the KBBQ places in Vegas, until Hobak opened up! I've been going here frequently since this place first opened up, so this review is long overdue! I love everything here from the food, ambiance and customer service. If anyone asks me to recommend an Asian restaurant in Vegas, this is the spot! I've taken family here as well as friends, everyone loves it!   I always order the beef combo. I've tried all of the choices of beef but my favorites would have to be brisket, skirt steak and boneless short ribs! I love the Hobak sauce that you can use to dip your meat in. For brisket, I also love to dip mine in the cheese which might sound weird but it's so delicious! Brisket also comes with sushi rice and wasabi which was very different but it's also a must try! Their combos come with a bean paste soup, steamed egg and rice pop ice cream dessert. Not to mention the side dishes, you will leave the restaurant feeling extremely full! They also have a complimentary slushy machine by the entrance that you can enjoy while waiting for a table!   I used to go to many AYCE KBBQ since they were cheap and didn't care too much about quality. Ever since Hobak, I never return to AYCE places again! Quality makes such a huge difference and I don't think Hobak has ever let me down in their quality of meat they serve!   I have also tried some other non AYCE places out there in Vegas but I must say, none of them beat my love for Hobak. Definitely recommend anyone to come and give this place a try! The wait is always long though (since it's soooo good!), so be prepared to wait!",

Hobak Korean BBQ has exceptional taste in presentation, their staff's attentiveness, and making sure you are enjoying yourself. Whether you are with a large or small group-their waiters are quick to check on you, quick to help you with your selection, and truly kind! I came here with my company's boss, coworkers, and their family. They treated my coworker's daughter with such KINDNESS and adoration - I have never seen this in a restaurant before! I would be so proud of the training and attention meal presentation that goes on behind the scenes here! The food tasted incredible. I really enjoyed the ribs, I'd highly recommend getting a variety of meats though - let your taste buds enjoy EVERY kind of food this place has to offer! I can't wait to come back!",

The entire meal finishes off with a delicious ice cream sandwich if you get the combo.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and it was a nice change from the restaurants available on the Strip.

They take care of the meat so you don't have to, plus there's a whole set of things to brush your teeth in the restroom right after! It looks like a great place to have a dinner party.

I came early for dinner, so we immediately got a table, and the appetizer/free stuff was given to us as soon as we got there. This includes kimchi, some sauces, cheese, radish soup, a pancake, salad, and probably something else that I can't remember. The other people in my party had never tried Korean barbecue either, but we decided to get the small family meal 3. It was plenty of food. The service seemed ridiculously fast, and there was never a time where you had nothing to eat. You always had something to snack on, and there was A LOT to snack on. The meat was delicious, and it was nice to have it cooked by someone else, as they know when it's done, and I didn't. You eat little bites of meat with the sides, and you have a jolly good time. Again, it was all delicious, and the only thing I didn't love was the soup, but I just don't like cucumbers all that much. The interior was crazy and silly, but very nice at the same time. All the staff was well trained and knowledgeable, and they never left you waiting for something or forgot about you. After all, if they did, you would lose the meat. After the entire meal, we spent $80, for more high quality food than I would ever expect to get for that price, and  a unique and fun experience. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Legit korean BBQ with good service and a vibe that is similar to (almost copycat-like) to the Kang Ho Dong Baekjong chain of restaurants in LA, but without the corncheese and egg that is cooked with the beef juices on the side of the grill.   The combos here do come with steamed egg and bean paste stew, along with a variety of banchan and dongchimi broth.    But the real reason that this restaurant exists is to serve prime meat that is cooked on the various grilltops throughout the meal, and I have to say that Hobak has some of the finest meat in Vegas.  I think I may have to say that the quality rivals that of the top KBBQ restaurants in LA as well.  The brisket and the boneless short rib are definitely the stars of the show, with the other beef offerings taking a strong second place.  The aged pork ribs and pork jowl are also tasty, but I prefer the beefy flavor and tenderness from the parts of the cow.   I also enjoy eating the brisket with the sushi rice & wasabi that come together, just for that extra pop of sweet/sour flavor.    Ending the meal with the ice cream sandwiches makes you wish that you actually saved some room in your stomach for them, because the dessert is quite tasty.    This place gets busy REALLY quickly, and the wait can get long just as fast.  The food and the service is worth it, however, and I wouldn't hesitate to wait for a table here at Hobak.",

Nothing was overcooked, everything was so juicy and delicious.  The sides were great too - we had a green onion / bean sprout salad, daikon, a cold soup, a regular green salad, a marinated bok choy dish and kim chee.  I liked that there were a lot of vegetable options.  I definitely can't wait to come back with more friends.  One note - be prepared for a wait.

I wanted to try the BBQ but the prices and portions are geared for more than one person. That's one reason I like the AYCE option at other places.  The tofu stew was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice and very tender chunks of pork. It was the first time I had cold noodles and the taste was spot on. I loved the presentation of frozen chunks of vegetable broth that kept the noodles cold. I requested the sides as u didn't know if everyone got them or if it was just for those eating BBQ.

There are various combos you can order depending on your preferences and party size, but Hobak is worth a visit if you enjoy overall quality for your buck. My boyfriend and I really love their combo with both pork and beef, but if you have other preferences, the server will walk through the menu options with you. I love their sides and they even have all the essential dips I love having with my KBBQ.   Whenever I take friends or anyone here, I always end up ordering a combo and add ons so everyone can get the full experience. Dessert is prepared for everyone by the servers as well and the place is super clean and decently ventilated.   They don't take reservations, so come early on the weekends to get your name on the list because this place is usually poppin'.",

The grilling instrument has a closed top and an open fire option for the fire grilled steak. They add real charcoal for added flavor. Both the steak and the meat marinated meat needed some extra salt for cooking. I would like to see a higher temperature on the grill to get better flavor and grill marks on my steak. They offer to cook and cut the meat for you or you can do it yourself. For the best experience, I would say do it yourself. We chose a family beef combo option. Price was reasonable. For the food part, it came out to $25 per person. It is not AYCE, but you get enough. Maybe not the best but definitely worth trying",

I've always gone to other places when it comes to KBBQ, but I've gotta say that the meat here is the best. I'm so used to doing all-you-can-eat so the menu was a little daunting at first glance. However, our server Randy was very helpful with his suggestions and made the whole process quick and easy. It was weird at first with having someone else cook for us, but it turned out great because all our meats came out perfectly.",

The side dishes that accompany the meats are well seasoned and tasty. We ordered the spicy angus fried rice this time thru a recommended review on Yelp. It was delicious. We always eat here a la carte, instead of other Korean all you can eat places. The meat quality is high quality. We are always served by Ronnel. He is very friendly and attentive. The only short coming I would say is I called to check if they were open during a holiday weekend. The female staff member said she only works the morning, so she wasn't familiar with what time they were closing. Maybe if she took the initiative to place me on a brief hold and check, I would have been a satisfied customer.",

During service, asked for more salad. Never came. Asked for more water. Never came. After we were done, we were pretty much abandoned and they forgot about the dessert that came with our pricey combo.  Very very slow and they were not attentive at all.  I would not recommend. Vegas has a lot of other great options for Korean BBQ now.  We went out of our way to go there and it was not worth it.",

The food is definitely worth the wait!  I love that they are so organized and get you in and out quickly.  The food is exceptionally fresh and it's so nice that the server actually does the cooking for you.  I'm always worried at other Korean BBQ's that I didn't cook the food all the way and I'm going to get sick but here they take all the worry out of it.  We ordered the large beef combo and added the spicy short rib and spicy angus fried rice (which is my two favorites).  For 2 adults and 2 teens it's a little on the light side so next time we'll add a 3rd extra dish.  The pork meal does come with more food but we aren't big pork eaters.   I love the bean paste soup and could eat it all myself.  We also tried the cold noodle soup.  It wasn't my favorite but our friends from Korea said it was very good and just like home.  Lastly the meal ends with the best ice cream sandwiches ever!  I suggest the mint chocolate chip or cookies and cream.   Best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas and can't wait to go back again!",

This restaurant is brand new (about a week old), and on the edge of Chinatown, so we would not have found this place without the Yelp reviews.  We got the beef and pork combo for 2, and everything was delicious . So. Much. Food.   The beef and pork were both very flavorful and tender, and very high quality.  I've tried at least 5 k-BBQs in Vegas, and this one is by far my favorite!!!!!  The food quality is topnotch, and the service is PHENOMENAL!!!!!  Most k-BBQ places will only cut the ribs and maybe flip the meats a few times for you, and it's mostly self-service.  At Hobak, it's table-side service 100%.  Our supa kawaii server NANA was a super star!!!! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, the food prep, and was super friendly.  She cooked and cut all of our 4 different types of meats.  This was the best service I've had in a long time  Andrea also helped us, and she was super friendly and fantastic as well.  Thanks Ladies!!!!  I'll be back next week   ************  I  Hobak, and I want to share this amazing place with everyone I know--took a different friend for late late late dinner at 12am (it's Vegas after all), and tried the all beef combo for 2.  The food and service were just as fantastic as my last review.  Let me post some more pics",

The kimchi was made in house and was delicious. We also had the soju and is was super cold so that made it event better. Make sure you save room for dessert we had the Korean version of an ice cream sandwich but it was made with rice and mango and vanilla ice cream. So tasty. I can't wait to come back again.",

The food was plentiful and we were all stuffed. I ordered the beef special and the Japchae noodles. It cost $140 for all of us. They cooked the meat in front of us. Yummmmy!! And the side dishes were great for the choosy small ones. Most of our kids were 2.5 yo. Then there were ice cream sandwiches which I personally loved!! And of course the kids also ate up happily! My friend that invited us is a super foodie from LA and she said this was the best in Vegas! I love Korean food and I also thought this place was legit. I even like their starter veges onion salad.",

To the other Korean BBQ owners that are now going to have to step up their game, I say good luck! I didn't know what I was missing till I came here. Thank you soo much for opening HOBAK now I wont have to think so hard about which Korean BBQ place to go to anymore since there is only 1 perfect one in Vegas.   Gotta Give a shout out to Kaylee Cho for recommending this place to my Fiance and I because we absolutely loved our experience here!",

I used to never go to Korean BBQ in Vegas, but now this place will be the one and only place I will go for Korean BBQ in Vegas  My boyfriend and I shared the Beef Combo for two, it was a decent amount of food and we left feeling full, but not overly stuffed. The meats were soooo tender and juicy, and they cook it for you so you don't have to worry about anything except eating. The combo came with an egg and a soup stew, both were delicious! The ice cream sandwich was really good as well - I was surprised by how light and refreshing it is for ice cream, perfect end to our meal!",

Coming from LA, I have very high standards for KBBQ since LA is known for the best, but Hobak blows a lot of restaurants out of the water. First of all they use wood chips to grill the meats so the meats are packed with flavor. The quality of the meats is top notch and you can tell by looking/eating it. They offer a lot of awesome side dishes with free refills. One of my favorite dish that I also ordered on the side was the spicy buckwheat cold noodles. They cook/cut everything for you, ready to eat. On top of that greatness, they offer you free ice cream at the end of your meal! What more can you ask for? Oh yeah, they give you a bottle of cold water on your way out into the dry desert heat! 5 STARS!",

This has only been open for 5-6 weeks btw.  Service- our server was CODY! He was awesome. He taught us a fun Korean drinking game of some sort. He also cooked our food and man, he was on point. I also requested for a song from BigBang and he delivered! Thanks Cody! We left tip not because it was customary but because our service was more than what we expected.  Food- to die for. We got a beef combo and an extra order of marinated skirt steak. That skirt steak was crack for us. Cody cooked it medium rare and it was perfect! Juicy and very flavorful. Their side dishes, especially the kimchee and bbq sauce made us enjoy our food even more! The green tea ice cream sandwich was bomb! They use rice cracker of some sort with chocolate and red beans! Yuuuummm!  Ambiance- reminds me of the authentic bbq places in Korea. From their grill to the contemporary decorations, they definitely set themselves above other kbbq. They have butchers in the back where you can see them get the meats ready. Bathrooms were very clean with free tooth brush and mouth wash! All kpop music too! They have a nice waiting area outside where they have water mists for clients to turn on and off.   We will definitely be back to try other dishes but the price was definitely worth it. The meats were fresh, service was fun and place was clean. Like I said, it's only 5-6 weeks old. If they keep this up then they have a bright future ahead.",

As the place transports you almost instantly.   First things first: the atmosphere. The overall aesthetic of the place could best be described as what most trendy and upcoming Korean restos/coffee shops do best: which is an eclectic but tasteful mix of vintage and modern edge. From the string lights overhead mimicking a cute little alley way to the old school telephone booths and vintage Coca Cola machines/ads as well as the 1940s movie posters plastered haphazardly about; this place definitely does not skimp out on the little details that makes an experience one for the books.   As for the food, it isn't AYCE but the quality and the mix (we ordered the family combo) was enough to fill three people comfortably, not too much and not too little.   My favorite however would have to be the service. If not the spicy pork belly (dipped generously in that little side ceramic filled with melted cheddar cheese) and the ambiance then the service took the cake for me.   Simply Ask for Nana and thank me later. You'll see",

    "text": "4.5 stars  Me and 3 girlfriends grabbed lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. I tried calling the night before to make reservations for dinner but they only take reservations for 8 or more people. They said typically for weekend dinners, people start arriving by buses, so just be prepared to wait!  We ordered the Hobak Family combo, which comes with a combo of beef and pork. The side dishes weren't bad but I was disappointed with the salad because it wasn't the traditional Korean dressing. The bean sprouts dish mostly had green onions in it so we had to ask for a refill about 4 times. I could definitely taste the quality of the meat. The meat basically melts in your mouth. Unfortunately, rice is not included in the meal but there was more than enough food for the 4 of us! The servers were very nice and constantly checked up on us to help us cook our food.   Honestly, my favorite part of the restaurant is the atmosphere. It looks like you're eating on the streets of Korea, it's so cute! I recommend trying this place out if you want quality over quantity.",

I was thinking it would be enough for both of us, but what a surprise, after the first 2 beef serving I was really full the here comes the last one which is the spicy pork. Cannot believe that it's so much food.  I will definitely recommend this place to have a good Korean bbq. The beef is really high quality, well marinated and melts in your mouth even the sides was so good. Don't forget the good service. Definitely 5 stars for my taste I have to add something and I'm sure no other restaurant will have FREE Toothbrush for costumers.... YES !!!!! FREE TOOTHBRUSH ..",

My only issue is that you guys don't offer anything free refills like ice tea. You can't lose anything from brewing iced tea and serving it. You guys have executed team service effectively so no reason you can't offer at least iced tea. Anyways that is why I gave 4 stars instead of the 5 you guys deserve for food. If you can change the no iced tea policy. Then I can change my 4star to 5 star in a rush!",

The round table stand was out of drums, which is ingenious. The exhaust on each table was adjustable, so not too much smoke, but my clothes still smelled. I like how they have gas and charcoal combined to have the real barbeque flavor.   Now to the food part. Oh my, was the first words that came out of my mouth when I had my first bite. We ordered a set menu for two, and I think it was still too much for my husband and I. would say portions was pretty decent. The skirt steak I think was the bomb!!! Dessert was something different, so I recommend it. You'll be surprised.   This place is not eat all you can. Did I mention free cold drink while waiting for a table.  Definitely will be back!!! And the service was exceptional. I hope they keep it up. I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "We had a great first experience here, despite a typo in the menu. The family combo says it includes the high end short rib cut but the Korean actually says it is a pork cut. With that out of the way, Hobak undoubtedly has the closest experience to \"authentic\" Korean BBQ in Las Vegas - and I just came from a vacation in Korea!   Korean BBQ almost undoubtedly involves the use of charcoal. While Hobak isn't purely charcoal, it does include it in it's gas driven grill, and it does make a difference to the flavor. This hybrid combination means that the flavor of the meat is enhanced with a little more char. This alone sets them apart from all other Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.  The meat quality here is very good, comparable to DJK. Of course, that means that it is a little pricier than AYCE places, and while the combos have plenty of meat, you can't necessarily stuff your face here. That being said, we were completely satisfied with the amount of food.  One of the things to look at here is the way they decorate the interior. It has some fun elements that borrow from the Korean streets, including posters to old Korean movies and a \"storefront\" style butcher area. The butcher area here helps indicate that the cuts are fresh and that presenting the meat actually means something.  The dessert is a fun take on an ice cream sandwich using Korean rice puff snack instead of cookies.",

Or that you don't know what the cuts of meat are or which ones are gonna be marinated to perfection? How many times do you attempt to simmer and sauce the selection only to burn the main course and ruin the mood, not to mention your appetite? Are you tired of being the butt of the joke, because you can't cook the butt of a pig properly? Hobak delivers, and so much more. No more cheap meat, or awful cooking! That's a thing of the past. Not only do they have outstanding quality cuts of meat, but they only use quality ingredients to spice up your evening. The best part? They cook every single piece, every slice to your specific tastes. Why settle for less, when you can be fed by the best?",

    "text": "During a recent Vegas trip, my husband, my sister-in-law, and I decided to try Korean BBQ for the first time. We had been dying to try this and I'm so glad we did. It was amazing! We were super stuffed afterwards, but it was worth it. Upon arrival, we were seated quickly and our waiter came over promptly. We explained we were new and he went over the menu, gave recommendations, and left us to decide. When he came back, we ordered the grapefruit soju (SO DELICIOUS) and the Family Combo. This came with four different types of meat - half beef and half pork. It also came with several side dishes - a veggie stew, steamed egg, veggies, melted cheese, small salad, and several dipping sauces. The waiter helped cook all our meat, asking how done we wanted it (medium rare). My two favorites were the Marinated Skirt Steak and Short Ribs: These were amazing. Super flavorful and extremely tender. I would definitely order again. After three meats came out, we were waiting on our fourth (the spicy pork belly). Our waiter seemed to have disappeared and another waiter stepped up to take over. He cooked our spicy pork belly, which was delicious, but I'd definitely order something else next time. (The meat was very thinly sliced and not entirely what we were expecting.) Then, for dessert, we had two different flavors of Rice Pop Ice Cream (mango/strawberry and green tea). The green tea was amazing - I'd order all green tea next time. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves. It was definitely a great choice and when I'm in town again, I'll definitely be back!",

While you wait they're serving slush for free so you can cool down from the summer heat. The interior looks great and looks unique compared to other kbbq's in town. You can definitely taste the quality difference with the meats compared to any ayce. It's a lot better! They also change the grill depending on the meat that is being served so most of them are tailored to cook specific meat. To top it all of, the service we received was really great! Nari and Ryan explained everything to us and made us feel really welcome.",

A server helps cooks so we don't have to which was a nice surprise.   I think I got food poisoning here. I'm not exactly sure. I'm not putting blame on this establishment at all. Hobak was the last place I ate at before I started having stomach problems. Maybe it was the self-serve popcorn near the front door or maybe it was the chocolate mint candy at the host desk... Because I've been eating the candy all day the following day after... Again I'm not putting blame on the establishment.   4 stars for the service, price and portion.  -1 for the overrated reviews.

We ordered Family Combo #2 (non-marinated meat) and I was in meatlovers heaven. I'm pretty OCD about cooking Korean BBQ but the service here was so good that I didn't even have to lift a finger.  We started with the brisket, which cooks so quickly and is perfect when you're getting hangry. They served it with sushi rice and wasabi, which I found to be quite interesting and delicious as well. Next was the outside skirt, an average cut in my opinion. By this point, the steamed egg and bean paste stew had also arrived. The stew was so good!  The best meats were next - pork belly and pork jowl. The pork belly was cut fairly thick and had a little bit of dry seasoning. Both types of pork took a while to cook and was cooked with a sprig of rosemary. I've had pork belly many times in my life and this was a very memorable time. It server cooked it to level of crispiness that I like. It was everything I could've hoped for with pork belly.  We were so stuffed at this point and the combo also includes dessert. We each had half of large rice pop green tea ice cream sandwich. What a great ending to an awesome meal.",

If your hair is fixed, or you have frizzy hair, bring something to cover your head because on the outside, when you walk in, there's mist blowing everywhere to cool you off.  I liked that this BBQ had a few pieces of charcoal in it before they lit it up.  You can either order the steaks you want to grill, or do a combo pack.  We did the family combo for 2 which was $65.  Not a bad deal! It came with 4 different kinds of meat, some stew (soup), steamed egg, and ice cream.  The eggs were really good.  We chose the strawberry flavored ice cream and it was pretty good. It tasted similar to a strawberry shortcake.  It was strawberry ice cream between some waffles.  The seasoning on the meats were perfect.  No complaint at all on that.  The side dishes tasted alright.  Not bad.  I would recommend this place to others that are coming to Vegas.  I would also come back if I ever return to Vegas.  You know it's good if Andrew Zimmerman did an episode on this restaurant.",

No doubt this place has consistently tender meats and the sides have been decent in the past. However, last night was terrible. The sides were not interesting and for some reason all the meats cooked tasted like propane. Even the steamed egg tasted terrible like it was steamed in a vat of liquid propane.   With the addition of many other quality kbbq restaurants in town, Hobak should have a place at the top of the pile because they, at least, cook the food for you but when the taste of the food was as bad as last night, you'd wonder if their days are numbered.",

Combo for two(?) forgot the exact name of it, but they have really good sets of combos for example, set 2 for two people, set 3 for three people and etc., and you have choices to pick meats, and the amount is more than enough! They have really good meats, but going beyond, the Korean Soy Bean Soup, Boiled Eggs, and the desert, Ice Cream also must try!   Most of all, impeccable service! If you ask, they provide.  Food: Good Price: Good Service: Good Parking: Good",

We Yelp'd a few places and came across Hobak Korean BBQ.    When we first walked in I realized it was not an AYCE but we opt to stay and dine here.    We ordered the Family Combo 1 that feeds 3-4.   Oh my good lord, that was a lot of meat and I think it feeds more than 4 people. LOL.    Our combo had the following along with Ban Chan dishes:  Angus Brisket Pork Belly Aged Pork Rib Spicy Angus Boneless Short Rib  The meats are definitely premium cuts.  All were good but my least favorite was the aged pork rib.  The short rib was a little spicy but nothing that a cheese dip can't offset.    Our server was very nice and everyone were attentive.  One of my friends fell asleep at the table so we asked the server to hurry and cook our food so we could get her back to our hotel room. Even though we were rushing, the server was calm, changed our grill as needed and cooked the meats for us.    What stood out to me most was the service we received.  Good job Hobak.",

I won't lie their prices are little pricey but after saving up for a little bit it is a great place to eat and is very well worth it!!",

They keep an eye on the smoke stack for your comfort and they are very efficient 2. A nice finishing touch is the desserts made with rice cracker and choice of ice cream!   3. Had several kinds of meat but kalbi/Korean short rib is always my favorite 4. Beers on tap  Service  1. Efficient  2. It may not seem conversational but to me very consistent with the culture , may be a cultural factor here.  But overall nice when you asked for refills etc  Ambiance 1. Nice!  Did you know they have tooth brushes and floss and mouthwash in the bathroom??  So awesome.  2. Large and spacious adequate seating  3. Wait time can be high  4. Good amount of parking  MoJo  1. This is a one of a kind kbbq 2. I think it is by combo and not all you can eat or ayce, but I prefer good quality over poor quantity",

My complaint is that I do feel rushed since there is such a long wait to eat here so if there could be another location to help ease that or something that would be great. Even the ridiculous wait time beats the other two restaurants by a long run.",

This is a great place to go with a group of friends, we were a group of seven which worked perfectly.  We ordered the Family Combo, with brisket, pork jowl, spicy beef short ribs and spicy pork, all of which was cooked in the most dramatic fashion.  In the center of the table the the staff threw the meat onto the grill where it was nicely cooked while we ate and drank.  The sides we ordered were spicy pepper stew, and Angus fried rice with the egg.  The other sides were kimchee, a couple of salads, pickles, bok choy and assorted oils and sauces.  An excellent experience with excellent food.  Get off the strip and try this out!",

One of the other huge bonuses is the free slush served when it's a blazing hot triple degree Las Vegas summer outside.   We decided to go with one of the beef combos which came with a healthy serving of banchan (Korean veggie and side dishes) and ordered some chap chae as well. Everything was just as one would expect KBBQ to be like. Damm good. The kimchi is fresh and the beef is melt in your mouth amazing!   Would I come back. Hells yes!",

But this place is so similar it's awesome. The only complaint I would have is the portions size, the beef brisket was not a Large order! I guess we must be use to LA standards that we expect much, but the skippy portions can get expensive! So I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for some good food, and a fun atmosphere. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The ice sandwich is bomb! It's has a unique crisp outer layer (reminds me of chicharron lol) but I loved it!   Love the new Flavor added to the list- Cookies and Cream, it definitely makes the meal experience even better. I am a little bummed out that the hours changed, and they're no longer open late. That means. No more late night drop by's",

The Staff will cook the meat for you and let you know when your meal is ready to devour. It can be pricey, but you are paying for the great quality of meat.  You can either buy by meat, or you can do a combo. My friends and I bought the Large Family Combo 2 which can feed 3 ~ 4 people. Family Combo 2 has Angus Brisket, Premium Pork Belly, Outside Skirt Steak, Premium Pork Jowl or Premium Pork Neck; we choose the Premium Pork Neck. The Premium Pork Neck tasted not as tender as what I'm used to when I eat Pork Neck. Other than that everything was delicious, especially the Outside Skirt Steak.  The Family Combo came with Boiled Egg Soup and Bean Paste Stew, along with a few rolls of Sushi Rice. For dessert, the Family Combo comes with Ice Cream Rice Cracker Sandwiches. You choose two flavors, and we choose Chocolate and Cookie & Cremes.  The interior was nice and spacious, and they played Korean songs and Korean MV on the TV.",

Our combination came with beef and pork and you can tell that they were serving high quality meat. My favorite was the pork belly and pork jowl. What I love about Korean bbq, aside from the delicious meat, are the sides that it comes with (kimchi, radish, soups, etc.). They were more than happy to give us refills of their kimchi -yum!   We also shared a couple bottles of soju which perfectly paired with the grilled meats.   This place is a bit pricey, but totally worth it!",

It was the first combo if I remember correctly.  First of all its alot of food !!! But it was sooooo good ! I really liked it to my surprise and my fiancee loved it. They cook the meat for you which was a big reason we chose to come here.  The service is unlike anything I have ever experienced. They are so on top of it !!   The combo came with dessert at the end . We got the strawberry flavor and I am stilllll thinking about it!!!   COME HUNGRY !!",

Came in here with no real expectations at the end of a turnaround trip over in vegas, and have been hearing about this place for the past couple years. Half of those who came say its better than Kang Hodong Baekjong over here in LA.  Well, to start off we showed around 5pm on a Saturday and were seated almost immediately, but shortly after a crowd / wait started to build up.   We went ahead and grabbed a small family combo 3, and added brisket to the order. The banchan they have is super fresh, and they arent shy to bring you more, so request away, and lets get to the MEATS.   The Hobak Skirt Steak, Pork Belly, and brisket were all pretty good. Nothing too amazing, but they were good, but the surprise was the Hobak Aged Short Ribs and Spicy BL Short Ribs. Gotta say the aged short ribs literally melted in our mouths and the spicy was super juicy and flavorful.   Gotta say the Hobak Aged Short Ribs was a surprise and possibly the best kalbi we've all ever had, and thats saying a lot.   Throw some soju and hite in the mix and you're in for one hell of a meal.   Go head, and make sure you dont skip on the aged short ribs. That alone gets a fiver from me.",

Be aware, the beef combo for 3-4ppl is the same amount you get for 2-3 but almost double the price. There are way better kbbq places on spring mountain than here. Save yourself $200",

Small table, won't clear the dishes, small portions for a party of 3 even for large dinner combo. Party of 5 sitting on the table, we ask for more banchan, should double up on one plate. Slow... slow service for the meats and low fire. We hungry, get it rotating. Didn't even change our grill after our brisket to fire wire. Took more than 10 min to get our ice cream after we paid bill. We literally left without it because it isn't worth an additional wait after 30min for seats that we are keeping for the next group. Get your heads in the game, my gods. And top it all off, it was for my birthday. I didn't get anything. I didn't want the loud music and lights anyway.",

We had a great ice cream sandwich at the end that was made by the house. Although I had no room leftover !   The service was good and the guys came by to cook for us. Which was very nice because they cook well and it helps us relax.  We took an Uber there so they gave us 10% off and an additional coupon for 10% off for another visit!   A+++!",

The potato pancakes stood out, along with the bean sprout salad.   The restaurant is clean, trendy and has a fun vibe. Our server, Gregory was excellent and took great care of us.   We will be back!

The only downfall we experienced was that we had one lady that cooked our meat for a party of 8 using two flames, she was nice but she seemed overwhelmed working several tables besides ours. We also ordered rice, added onion salad and egg soup and they forgot those as well until we reminded them.   So all in all, the ice cream pop was yum (green tea was good), the food was great, and even though the service could have been better, we will still be back.",

I've to admit the meats melts in your mouth but lack in flavor and that is something I, my husband and mom does not like. No matter how tender the meats are, if no seasoning or marinade then it's just bland..  The decor is cute, BUT I really hate the table.  It's SOOO small.  Such bad design !!! with all the banchan (Which is NOT good) and setups there weren't much room to eat and the vent that pull up and down is useless. Smoked was all over the restaurant.  I come out smelling like BBQ, not when I go to Gen.  If you have small child like mine (16 months) using an iPad mini, it fell down touching the grill. This is not a place to take small kids. Music was loud and and table is too small...  The only good experience that came out of this was the dessert.. I LUV the green tea ice cream",

And boy, did it.   Hobak is located in a small business strip mall off of Spring Mountain road. Lots of parking, so that's not an issue. Walking into this place is a trip. It reminds me of a an 80's Korean city street. They have the modern vent systems, which is great btw.  I've made this argument before, and I will continue to in the future, Kbbq that is grilled over charcoal is different and tastes much better than when it's grilled over gas. And this is the only place in town that has it.  Onto the food. Hobak advertises themselves as having black angus beef. So, I had to try it. The meat was fantastic. It's the creme de la creme. All the sides were well prepared, especially the steamed egg.  The service was great as well. The server was great and attentive. She also cooked all the meat perfect. Just great.  One of the best Korean BBQ places not only in Vegas, but one of the best all around that I've ever been too.",

    "text": "This review is based entirely on the lack of service and poor procedures. After waiting approximately 40 minutes, our buzzer went off. We handed it to the hostess, who told us we would be seated next.   During the next 20 minutes, 4 additional parties were seated. When we asked why we had been told we were next and yet other parties were being seated ahead of us, we were told that because we were a party of five we needed to wait for a round table.   However there were two round tables that had only two people seated at them. In fact, the party seated just prior to our buzzer going off was a party of two that was seated at a round table. In addition, she asked a party of 2 and a party of 4 if they would be willing to sit together at a large table during this 20 minute window.  The manager came and told us that we just needed to wait for the round tables that are large enough for 5.  We asked why parties of two were being seated at the larger tables and he said they do not seat parties of 2 at the large tables despite the fact that there were two separate examples of this right there!   When we asked how much longer it would be for a round table, we were told perhaps another 20 minutes. We left without trying the food.   I'm sure the food is excellent and worthy of some of the higher star ratings, however the management needs to know to seat smaller parties at smaller tables and seat the larger parties at the larger tables rather than make the larger parties wait twice as long.  In addition, the hostess followed us to our car to ask for the buzzer which we had turned in over 20 minutes earlier. I believe she had already handed it out again to another party.",

I think i've watched enough Kshows about Korean culture to understand.  The Hobak Aged Short Rib ($27.99) is marinated while the Angus Boneless Short Rib (31.99) is not.  Get the marinated one. The beef is seasoned and tenderized so well making every bite glorious. The bits of charcoal spread on the grill intensify it even more.  For a side dish the BibimBap (aka Shaken Dosirak in this case) comes in a tin and shaken at the table.  It's even just as fun watching instead of doing it yourself. Rice, Yolky Egg, Seaweed (Gim), Spam, and Seasoned Dried Squid (Ojingeochae-Muchim) all jingled with a sweet spicy sauce (Gochujang).  I like the addition of the squid in my lunchbox.  Def good eats.  Hobak exceeds all my expectations so much that i don't have anymore other options in town for Kbbq.  Heck, i don't even have to drive to LA either to get my fix either!  *update* 5/5/16  Spicy pork belly is fire! Crept up nicely and flavor is there.    Combo set is the way to go. You get same amount of meat if you were to order individually.",

    "text": "Holy cow! Holy Angus cow! Watch out Las Vegas, Hobak is here to set the Korean BBQ scene on fire! Hobak is a Korean BBQ franchise/chain in Korea. This location is their first US location.   The interior is exceptionally clean. The way that they decorated the place reminded me of Asian outdoor food stall areas. In places like Hong Kong and Seoul, they have food stalls and there are tables around the area where the customers sit and eat. It's like a food court but outdoors. They also had old movie posters posted in certain places. What was best about this place was that the round tables were decorated as though you're around a huge barrel. In Seoul, Korea, there is this one hugely popular KBBQ joint where your party literally all stand around a barrel and cook your meat. There's charcoal in the barrel and you just grill it. So it's really great that Hobak gives you a little glimpse of that.   Before they sit you and your party, they'll prep the table for you. They'll set all the dished down with the banchan and they'll fire the grill up first. Now, this is the best part: when you get to your table, you'll see that their grills are gas based, however, they also put a few pieces of coal there. You'll have the temperature control of gas (somewhat) yet the smokey flavors of coal - now THAT'S definitely different. No other Korean BBQ joint in the city does this as far as I know. Also, the modern ventilation systems! Definitely a plus! The only other place that has it is Doh Korean BBQ I believe.   Their menu mainly consists of beef and pork. If you're looking for chicken, seafood, or the huge variety that a place like Gen offers then you're in the wrong place my friend. In fact, if you're looking for AYCE .. this is definitely not the place. Everything here shall be a la carte. Hobak in Korea is largely known for their marinated meats so of course two of their highlighted items would be their marinated skirt steak and aged/marinated short ribs. Aside from that, they also have combo meals.  For their combo meals, you either choose beef, pork, or combo. Each combo meal comes with bean paste stew, steamed egg, veggies, cheddar cheese, and dessert. My boyfriend and I decided to go with their family combo: it has two beef dishes and two pork dishes. It'll give us a good round about feeling of the place, their style, and their quality. However, there is a typo on their family combo .. the English part anyways. It says the combo comes with Angus boneless short ribs but it turns out that its supposed to be aged/marinated pork ribs. We didn't realize this until later on in the meal when the meats were out. Granted, if you compared the Korean symbols, you'll easily find the mistake ...   I typically don't care for marinated meats so it was a huge disappointment that all the meats in the family combo were marinated. Despite that, their marination was not overpowering and also not overly sweet. They definitely have a good control over that aspect. Their marinated skirt steak was amazingly tender and pretty much melts in your mouth. Their aged short ribs were really good quality. Their spicy pork belly was also a huge surprise: it was sliced thinly like they do for brisket. The pork belly was really really delicious. It just melted in my mouth. Although, I would feel as though the pork belly would be better without the sauce...you'll be able to taste the pork more. I tasted a whole lot more sauce than pork. As for their marinated pork ribs ... it took the LONGEST to cook but it was really good. Because it's not an AYCE establishments, they are able to focus on the pure quality of the meats.   The service was phenomenal. Our server was always close by and they actually cook for you. Of course, you have the option to cook the meat yourself and the server will ask you which you prefer. We decided to let our server cook for us. Might as well get some good ol attention here! Our server's name was Sim and he was really really friendly. We had some friendly chats with him about the restaurant, about Seoul, and a few general things. He even would cut some of the char off of the meat if it was too much! Hobak is probably the only Korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas to give me superb service like this. It's just unbeatable at this moment.   If it gets busy however, I can see how it'll get harder and harder for the servers to be as attentive. It wasn't a full house but they had a decent amount of people dining the night we went. It was pretty good for being their 2nd day in business. But no fear! There is a service button on the side of the table!  Being as new as they are, they definitely need to work out some kinks here and there, like fixing the menu. Despite that, my dinner experience was a five star experience here with their service and quality. Especially when you compare it to the other Korean restaurants in the city. Will definitely be back for their beef combo! :) I think everyone should give them a try!",

We asked our server  Kevin that we want our brisket cook medium rare and he said that it should be cook well done because they don't cook their brisket medium rare. We even told him that we didn't like it well done because it gets chewy anyway he did it medium rare and every time we come here they always cook it the way we want it.  And we kinda felt like we're rush. Thankful that Tai came he made our experience a little better. Always nice and smiling :) and oh so very kind again thanks Tai! I hope you're our server next week!",

Our server grilled our food for us and even gave us a detailed description of every side dish and meat that we ordered. All the staff was very nice and friendly :) We order the Family Combo (or something like that). The food was super yummy and not very expensive for the quality of food you're getting.The ice cream they gave us at the end were sooooo good!!! We were all super full when we were finished. I would totally recommend this restaurant if you're ever in the area!",

Hot sauce and extra peppers were available for those who want hot.  We had the beef combo with brisket, rib eye and skirt steak. Brisket was my favorite.

The meat was perfectly marinated and cooked to perfection by our waitress. Every course was spectacular and the service was second to none. The night before we visited a steakhouse in the strip that cost us over $200 (no liquor) and this place kicked that in the butt at least 100x's. Do not miss this place go go go!!",

He taught us everything about the menu and guided us through with how he grilled our meat.

We would spend from 200-400 per meal from 2-5 people at some of the best restaurants Las Vegas had to offer. We absolutely love Asian food, and we went to the best Vegas had. Being skeptical of Korean BBQ my 9 year old daughter was not very enthused when we told her we were going to Chinatown for lunch this time. Boy was she wrong!! We ordered the Skirt steak, and had to order a double portion because my nine-year-old almost ate the first portion by herself. The staff was truly impressive, and their courteousness, and service reminded us of how we feel when we get together for Thanksgiving or Christmas with the family. Needless to say we only have three days left in Vegas and we are probably going to revisit this place at least two more times!! Amazing Food, and affordable prices. 5Stars all the way!!!",

Clean restaurant as some Korean places I have been aren't the cleanest of places.   Pretty good priced food for the high quality meats. Unfortunately not AYCE but definitely better than other Ala Carte places.  Definitely coming back here !

We ordered beef combo and cold noodle (naengmyun), kimchi stew and bean paste soup. Beef quality was excellent! Kimchi stew was a little bit too sour but my mom liked it so much. All my family loved the meat and bean paste soup. Cold noodle (naengmyun) was a bit disappointing. Cold noodle soup taste more like an instant soup. But the ice cream sandwich was a hidden treasure. My kids wanted to go back just for the ice cream sandwich. We will definitely go back to this place when we visit Vegas. I almost wanted to take one star back for the cold noodle. But the service was excellent plus so I am keeping all five stars.",

There were four of us, so we went for the Large Family #3, marinated beef and pork. All were outstanding. Excellent banchan, especially the kim chee, pancake and been sprout salad. And as if there was not enough food, ice cream sandwiches for desert are included. All in with a couple of beers and 20% tip for four -- with leftovers -- $150. A bargain for the quality and service.

We waited outside and we had people to talk to and the external heater to keep us warm so the wait was pretty tolerable.  We came as a party of 5 and got the large Hobak special. It was pretty filling. It comes with the egg souffle and the bean paste soup. You can get a single refill on those two options but the other side dishes you just need to ask and they will give it. We also got the angus fried rice and it was too sweet in my opinion and the one that was spicy was much more satisfying.   The special came with about 4 different meat with the majority being marinated stuff. The meat was tender and pretty darn good. I can see why all the tourists and locals consider this place number one!",

I'm happy that my recent move to LV has given me the chance to try some new places, and Hobak was definitely on the top of my list. My friends visited this past weekend so we decided to check it out. We walked in at about 7pm on a Sunday night and the place was lively, we were seated after waiting about 35mins (beats the 1hr20 wait in LA already!!).   We ordered the Hobak Beef Combo (Large) to share between 5 people, the amount of food we got was more than enough to share. [1] Angus Brisket - nice marble, tender. [2] Angus Boneless Short Ribs - a favorite of the table, beautiful marble, tender meat, and grilled on a separate grill. [3] Marinated Skirt Steak - nice savory/sweet marinated. [4] Steamed Egg - standard steamed egg. [5] Bean Paste Stew - spicy and tangy. [6] Rice Pop Ice Cream - choice of two types of ice cream which is sandwiched between two crispy rice pastries.   Overall I thought Hobak was really good - the quality of meat was perfect, side dishes were good, and the service was excellent. The only things that I was disappointed with was that they didn't have rice paper or a house hot sauce. Overall great place and worth a try if you're ever in Vegas.",

My family and I had a good time despite the wait time and somewhat slow service. The reason for the not giving them the full 5 star despite the delicious meal we had was the missing items in our combo and lack of service. At times we were ignored by our server and drinks weren't filled accordingly. Overall the quality of their meats was good and banchan was delicious.  The upbeat and street-like atmosphere set this place apart from other Korean places. This was our first time trying out a Non-AYCE Korean BBQ Restaraunt and would reccomend this place based on quality.",

I think it was around 7pm when we got there on a Saturday. Apparently it's a chain in Korea? But still pretty dang good.   Service was great. The meat... very fresh and adding the rosemary to the pork belly was a nice touch. I loved how they took a mallet to the bottle of soju to get it slushy. The sides especially the scallion salad goes so well with the different meats. The sauces were delicious as well. Pretty much experimented and tried it with no sauce and then with different sauces and different sides.",

The food is pretty on point but the meat still isn't what you can get in Korea. Maybe it's too much to expect here... In any case, if you are in town, this is a pretty good place to kick it with your party, have a few drinks and and have some BBQ...",

While you wait, there are free slushies available and benches to sit on outside the restaurants, equipped with mists you can turn on if it's too hot.  The food: mouthwatering goodness. We ordered a small Hobak Family combo and I'd say it was one of the best Korean BBQ experiences I've had. The service was really good for the amount of things the servers had to do. The servers are really dedicated (thanks Jayden!!) and super nice. Would definitely come back when I'm in Vegas again!",

The first thing I noticed immediately was that a good amount of the workers here were not Korean so a lot of them didn't recognize dishes when I mentioned them in Korean. It would be nice to be able to order dishes in Korean at a Korean restaurant. Imagine going to a Mexican restaurant and asking for Carne Asada and the person working there saying \"The what?\"  We ordered the Beef Combo w/ jumuluk and kot sal which is always my go to. The beef quality was above average but nothing too impressive. The complimentary doenjang jjigae seemed watered down and bland which was very disappointing. Also there isn't too much banchan provided alongside the meal.   I'm still gonna say that my favorite KBBQ spot in Vegas is Magal. They give you better quality cuts of meat for similar price and they are going to give you a wider array of banchan alongside your meal.",

    "text": "Thank you my fellow yelpers! You guys were spot on in regards to this restaurant.  This place was so good. We came at 5 pm on a weekday and were immediately seated. Service was attentive and efficient.   We ordered a small combo recommended for two people. We opted for the brisket, angus beef short rib and marinated ribs (marinated with a tare sauce that is usually made with soy sauce, mirin cooking sake, ginger, garlic, scallions, and fruits). The meat quality is out of this world. Perfect marbling. I love their ban chans (side dishes)- steamed egg, jji gas (spicy stew), spicy marinated bean sprouts, sushi rice and wasabi to complement your brisket, kimchi (this could have been more fermented though), iceberg lettuce salad.  And as usual, side dishes can be refilled at Korean restaurants.   We also ordered a bottle of soju. There is something special about soju and gogi (meat) consumed together.  They ask how you like your meats cooked- brisket we like well done, the rest medium. It was nice having everything cooked for you.   At the end, ice cream is given- strawberry, vanilla, cookies and cream, mint, chocolate flavors. We had strawberry- it was sandwiched in between a light and crispy rice cake- ice cream rice cake cookie sandwich with a thin layer of red bean. Not too sweet and we both loved it.   They have korean pop music playing inside. There's a meat display inside. And an open kitchen. Restrooms are very clean- single rooms for women and men.   I would definitely come back here when the mood for KBBQ hits whenever I'm in town!",

The best way to order is getting any of the combo meals. They are pretty big portions for the cost. The servers will do everything for you such as cook the food/cut up the meat and refill your sides. The steamed egg takes a while to make, so order it at the beginning when you know the quantity that your party will want.   Dinner time is usually busy and most likely you'll have to wait 20-45 minutes prior to being seated. They don't take reservations so plan ahead. Like any korean bbq joint, you'll leave smelling like the food, but definitely worth it. They have an area outside where you can vent out hahaha.",

They don't have 30 different banchans, and they don't have much else on the menu besides pork and beef. However, it is the BEST quality pork and beef I've ever had at a Korean bbq spot. The beef rivals that at steakhouses. And the pork is just so nice and thick and juicy. There's pork belly, pork jowl, pork ribs, and pork neck. It's all delicious. I usually stick to pork belly and the aged short ribs. You can't go wrong with any of the above. The portions are very generous. The combos are a good way to try different meats!   Ask for sesame oil to add to the salt. And use that for the pork. Game changer I promise!",

    "text": "Hobak is definitely in my top 2 favorite a la carte Korean BBQ restaurants in the city!   Why I'm a promoter of Hobak: - Excellent quality of meat - super tender and flavorful - Various meat combos to choose from with decent portions - best for large groups (can also order meat a la carte and other Korean dishes)  - Banchan tastes authentic - I love that they serve dongchimi here (cold radish soup) it's one of my fav Korean sides - Servers are very friendly - they're quick to greet you after seated and cook the meat for you  - They bring out bomb ice cream sandwiches at the end of your meal   Negatives:  - Since it's so popular and delicious, the restaurant can get incredibly busy. Expect a wait on weekend afternoon/evenings - may be slower during the day or on weekdays - During prime dinner time - servers may not stop by as often to replenish water and check on your table. Also if you request for additional sides, sauces, etc. - may take longer than usual to come out   Combos: **All combos are served with rice, bean paste soup, steamed egg, and ice cream sandwiches for dessert  **I personally prefer red meat and enjoy the Hobak Beef Combo  **Can be ordered Small (2 people) or Large (3- 4 people)   Hobak Beef Combo:  - $59.99 Small | $98.99 Large - Brisket, Boneless Short Rib, and your choice of either Marinated Skirt Steak or Aged Short Rib  Hobak Pork Combo (Options 1 + 2) - $50.99 Small | $85.99 Large - Pork Combo 1: Pork Belly, Pork Jowl , and your choice of either Grilled Spicy Pork Belly or Aged Pork Rib - Pork Combo 2: Pork Belly, Pork Neck, and your choice of either Grilled Spicy Pork Belly and or Aged Pork Rib   Hobak Family Combo (Options 1, 2 + 3) - $58.99 Small | $93.99 Large - Family Combo 1: Brisket, Pork Belly, Aged Pork Rib, and Spicy Angus Boneless Short Rib  - Family Combo 2: Brisket, Pork Belly, Outside Skirt, and your choice of either Pork Jowl or Pork Nick  - Family Combo 3: Marinated Skirt Steak, Spicy Angus Boneless Short Rib, Aged Short Ribs, and your choice of either Grilled Spicy Pork Belly or Aged Pork Rib   Wonderful Korean BBQ spot in Vegas. I've never met anyone who has disliked their experience or food here. I've always left Hobak super full and happy. It's so delicious!!",

I was able to have a steak at medium rare and NOT get food poisoning from a Korean bbq place, for once.  As soon as you walk in, it's a bit Smokey, but there's little things this place does that makes you appreciate it.  It gives off a downtown LA vibe, and I'm always down for that.  There's a slushee machine on the right when you walk in, a full tooth brush and mouth wash set in the bathroom, and febreeze to spray yourself once you leave.  My friend and I just finished work, so we started with drinks. Got a peach soju, and only needed one bottle for our empty stomachs.  We went with the family combo, but honestly, I probably would go for the all beef combo next time.  I'm not too big of a fan on the pork. It was a little tough to chew and dry (the shoulder or belly, can't remember) the pork jowl was tasty.  But my favorite was the steak and brisket.  Awesome time.  And I love that they cook for you.  Service was great. Carlos was awesome and helped us out as first timers.  My new go-to spot",

Oh my gosh, such a difference it makes using this meat. It melts in your mouth! AH! I am dreaming of it.   We ordered Set 3 i think. Angus brisket, galbi, spicy pork belly, and pork ribs.  The banchan was fresh, so tasty, and everything was just perfect. The gaeranjjim (steamed egg) was also soon good! They will cook for you if you like; it gets extremely busy, and the wait gets long, but I would wait here anyway. We chose to go early, so we missed the rush hour. Pro tip: go off-peak hours to get seated/eat faster.   The inside is fun and cutely designed. They have a red telephone booth inside, and it makes the atmosphere more light and fun. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable - be ready to eat!  I cannot recommend this place enough. I wish there were better Korean restaurants in New Orleans, and especially ones with the fresh banchan like here. I cannot wait to return, so i can go gorge in the deliciousness again.",

The price went up and the quantity of meat they give went down. Hopefully the quality of the meat doesn't change. Don't ruin a good thing",

The only reason why I won't give this place a 5 star is because of two occasions. There head server, taller asian guy with yellow armband, wou of come to our table and burn our food. It feels like he is rushing us to get out. He would turn up the flame all the way up and burn everything. If the rest of the staff, manager and food wasn't as good as they are I would stop cooking here because of that head server. He both times had made a happy occasions to a really bad experience.",

    "text": "I met my friend Rachel and her family here for lunch on Saturday 7/2/16 at 11:30am. There was a short wait before we were taken to our table. Free slushies were provided while you wait at self-serve machines in the front of the store. Outside, there was a cooler with bottled water for those guests who couldn't wait inside. (The waiting area is tiny.) These were definitely nice little gestures that I appreciated.   We were seated at a round table on the left side of the restaurant. Immediately once I sat down, I felt claustrophobic. There were plates of banchan everywhere, plus our actual plate to eat off, and cups and silverware. Since there were 4 of us, we got the large Hobak beef combo which includes 3 meats, veggies, cheese sauce, and ice cream. Plus all the banchan you can eat. The combo is $89.99 so for 4 people it's not so bad. Visually, it didnt seem like there would be enough meat for 4 grown adults, but they cut the meat into smaller pieces so it can cook thoroughly and it can be distributed throughout the table. With all the meat, rice and banchan, I certianly left full. We chose the brisket, angus boneless short ribs, and skirt steak for our meats.  What I liked  -Some of the banchan was very tasty. The bean sprout onion salad was a favorite amongst the table, as well as the bean paste soup.  -The skirt steak was delicious and had a really tasty marinade.  -The food is cooked for you by a waiter/waitress. This gives you a chance to sit back and relax and chat with your dining companions. -Each diner is provided a bib which I loved. I am a messy eater and I appreciated this little touch.  -Cheesy corn, this is what dreams are made of. So good, I highly recommend you get this. -The bathrooms are clean and equipped with toothpaste, brushes and mouthwash for an after meal cleanser.   What I didn't like -It smells like a butcher in there. The smell of raw meats permeated the air and was not very appealing.  -The table was tooo damn crowded. I literally had plates piled on top of each other because there was no where for them to go.  -The cheese sauce. The cheese never fully melted and I feel like it was out of place with what we were eating. Korean bbq and cheese? Methinks not. -The service was lacking. Our waitress was a bit standoffish, and hardly said two words to us. We were never offered drinks, the banchan and menu were not explained and I found out later were were not given one of the banchan at all -the pancake.  All in all I think this place was very good and I enjoyed my meal. I would definitely return here for some good eats.",

I talked about crypto here one time and then I bought crypto and it's gone up so that's good too.  Parking is fine I guess.  I don't like the decoration.  I took a star off for that but added it back because of the meat sushi.  I'm white tho so I don't eat all the extra stuff so I can't review that part.  Try it yourself they're still open!",

Bodden was our man here and if this place manages to hold onto amazing, hardworking, attentive (he cooked our food to literal perfection) food then this place will continue to be at the top of my list.  The food was definitely tasty. The competition amongst kbbq places are neverending. Having been to many places in LA and LV, I'm amazed at having this experience. It's traditional enough to keep me happy but also has a few different twists like rosemary added to the meats. Personally I don't care for the cheese fondue dip but that's a personal pref.   Thank you Bodden for the near perfect kbbq experience!",

For one, they took away my drink I brought in because it was 110 degrees outside and didn't want it to get hot. I had to leave it up front because they are so concerned with me bringing my drink. Talk about scarce mentality! I told them I would not drink it but who really cares anyway? I'm there with a party of 6 ppl and we ordered a lot! So this set me in a bad mood and then of course was disappoint in their food. Not sure what happened to the quality of their meats and side but it was not as expected from my last visit.

The interior reminds me of what Korea's street food shacks would look like just like in the Korean dramas. Round tables in the center of the room w/ a grill in the center, plus their vent thingy comes down to the grill so that you don't SMELL too extremely DERICIOUS when you leave te place. They also have TOOTHBRUSHES & MOUTHWASH in the freaken bathrooms!!! How convenient for a date night & business luncheons.  . The staff are all super nice & interactive & attentive as they cook your meal for you throughout the night. We have always had 4 same servers take care of us over & over although to be honest I can't freaken remember their names for the life of me except I think one of them is RANDY (correct me if I am wrong) they have all told me their names multiple of times but I'm also always starving when I goto eat which means I am not all there.  . We have gotten the combinations that they offer but the hubby & I prefer to order al a carte since we don't like the marinated meats too much. They also offer TWO FREE refills on your STEAMED egg hot pot & the BEAN PASTE soup!! When I found this out I was freaken mind blown!! . HOBAK MARINATED SKIRT STEAK $27.99 - SO usually when u getbrhe marinated skirt steak it is more tough but this things freaken shreds & MELTS AWAY!!!! They use pineapple in the marinade to make it as tender & juicy as it is!   HOBAK AGED SHORT RIBS $29.99 - it's like the closest thing to melting away goodness you can get. Just like butter.  PREMIUM PORK JOWL $23.99 - I normally don't like PORK but I like certain parts of the pork. This juicy fatty part is my favorite & no pieces of meat get stuck in between my teeth. They also serve this w/ cheese to dip in & OMG w/ some grilled garlic it's like WOW.  POP ICE CREAM $3.99 - Freaken GENIUS!!!!!!!!!! my childhood rice cracker snack sandwiched around green tea ice cream (they have other flavors too) w/ chocolate & sweet rice powder!!!  My favorite KOREAN BBQ place in VEGAS so far!!",

    "text": "Since I've been obsessing over Korean BBQ the last month or so, I needed to find a place out in Vegas. Hobak is about 3 miles from the strip, located in a shopping plaza in Chinatown. Right outside the restaurant was a cooler, full of iced water bottles free for the taking. Nice of them to provide it, since it was about 110 degrees at the time! There's a limited waiting area inside and there's also seating outside with a canopy and benches. I thought it was funny that there was a portable gas heater out there. When is it ever cold enough for that? LOL.   The wait for a party of 4 was pretty quick. About 10 minutes even though it was a full house! When we got our menus I was a little disappointed that it wasn't AYCE. We ordered the large Hobak Family combo (feeds 3-4). I picked up the tongs and began to flip the meat, and our server said he'd do it for us. Wow! I've never been to a Korean BBQ restaurant where they cook for us. I was very impressed. The meats were so wonderfully marinated. So juicy and tender. Although it wasn't AYCE, the serving sizes were more than enough. And the price came out cheaper than if it would have been. After the meal, we were given complimentary ice cream. We chose green tea. It was served on a rice cracker. Very interesting but delicious nonetheless!   Hobak definitely deserves the 5 stars. The food is out of this world, the service is stellar and for the first time ever, I walked out of a Korean BBQ restaurant smelling the same way I did walking in. Those vents work wonders! If you're in Vegas and need a break from the strip, come check this place out! When I come back, I'm definitely stopping by here again.",

    "text": "Normally would never say a non AYCE Korean BBQ would reign supreme in my world. Hobak definitely was an eye opener and a tasty one at that too! I have been to other Korean BBQ that the same concept cook your own meats etc a la carte and also AYCE. AYCE think the value really hard too compare. The places have gone a la carte the quality of the meats and the diversity of the menu at Hobak kicks it up another level. Really if you break down the dinner for two or three the price is very reasonable and you get more then enough food. The quality of the meats is fabulous they promote only use black angus steak. It shows. Lot of little things that feel separates Hobak from other Korean BBQ.  Before you even walk in the door odd see free water. It really unassuming they have ice cooler with paper sign and says feel free take one. I did on the way out because these 100 vegas days never have enough water. lol. The music walk in is straight k-pop or legit Korean music. They can have the music little loud and the place gets packed. The interior decor really enjoy.  Above the grill the air vents are ones and go up and down. So the restaurant never get smoky. The negative of the air vents is when it down or up hard talking stories or making conversation with friends dining with across the table. I had too move my head side side make eye contact more less make conversation. They have workers that cook the meats. So if concerned about cooking the meats they take that worry away. They do great job of changing the grill so never gets build up from meat after meat cooking on the same top. Before you sit down they have all your sides ready. I never seen that one before. Like it. The sides all very tasty and most part different then traditional ones. Sure they have your kim chee, bean sprouts (even then it more spicy version with other stuff), and they kick it up another level with pickled kale, some kind of pancake. If you order the pre set dinner get ice cream sandwiches. We had vanilla and green tea. The rice crispy something on the outside and the spread on the inside then combine it all with the ice cream. Perfect way end your meal. Both the Vanilla and Green Tea was different combination. I only had the Green Tea. My friends dining with tried both thought the Vanilla was the winnah. The service was no doubt five star.   If looking for non AYCE Korean BBQ. Hobak is the spot totally legit and truly deserving of five star!  Look forward too my next visit..",

    "text": "\"You mean I get to choose dinner as long as it's Asian?\"  happily proclaims my Midwest poker bud.  \"Something's wrong\" I say to my two fellow Asian poker buds.  \"He sounds too happy\".   \"Hobak\".  His triumphant reply.  \"280+ yelp reviews, FIVE star rating, and NO tripe, intestines, butt holes, brains, liver, heart, spleen and whatever else you guys like to eat\".  Best in Vegas?  Yes.  Authentic?  It's a small Korean chain and it's first location in the US.  The  ambiance, service, and experience comes straight out of a K-Drama.  In other words, friendly and prettied up.  All good things.   As for the food, limited selection but what is offered is done right.  Quality cuts of tasty, marinated meats.  Zero complaints unless you're a meat snob.  Tip:  Order sets (2 or 4 persons) for the best experience.  Portions are large.  For starters, the beef and honey (yes honey) tartare, a giant raw meatball, is surprisingly good.  soy, ginger, garlic, honey bring out the metallic flavor of the raw beef.  Good eats that would be outstanding grilled and put in a bun.  The beef, all USDA Choice Black Angus breed.  The two house specials; tender, flavorful marinated skirt steak and beefy \"aged\" short rib top the list.  Boneless short rib is tender and flavorful.    Pork is excellent.  The tender, porky jowls and even more intensely flavorful neck good eats, while the very fatty pork belly with its crispy fat and burnt bits, a pork lovers dream.  Finally, the spicy pork, not too spicy but loads of chili and caramelized honey sweetness.  Very good.  Standard banchan.  Standard KBBQ sides including veggies for grilling, steamed egg and the obligatory melted cheese (I never understood this but to each his own).  Servers do the cooking for you over charcoal grills that are changed regularly.  Thicker proteins are grilled whole to preserve their juiciness and scissors cut for service.  Very good ventilation system so you won't leave smelling too much like KBBQ.  Disposable toothbrushes provided in the restroom so no chance of garlic breath.  Very limited selection of beer, sake, soju.  Decent enough to wash everything down.  In a word, solid.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this place is awesome! It starts just outside the door where a cooler of ice cold bottled waters is chilling with a sign that says \"Please take one\" on it. They are super considerate of their customers who may be forced to wait outside in the heat. (The inside waiting area is not that big.)  Move inside and fast, friendly and efficient staff will start prepping your table. When you actually sit down a few minutes later, there are already some side dishes and water at the table. This makes reviewing the menu more enjoyable since people are not hangry while waiting. Drinks orders came out in about 2 minutes.   The food is very nice quality meats. However, it is not AYCE so keep that in mind. We ordered the Angus beef course, and added a few other orders of pork and pork belly. It was fantastic and served by very helpful and considerate (responsive) staff.  On the off-chance no one is around cooking your food (they do this for you) you can use their super buzzer. This doorbell-type button is on your table and has options for service, check, orders, etc. I love that since you don't have to try to flag someone down to get help.   It's a little more than I like to spend for non-AYCE but considering the great ambiance, service, and food quality, I was not too bothered. I highly recommend this place! Only reason I left 4 stars instead of 5 is I want all of these things for cheap! :)",

The place has a hip vibe, and I sure appreciate it, and they like to cook your meat and are very involved. The service is still super hectic, as they're trying to work out their kinks.

There was six of us and we all shared a 4 meat combo (3 type of beef - skirt beef, spicy beef, and short ribs with 1 pork - pork belly).  It is worth a try and happy to have visited.",

The servers here take care of the cooking and make sure they let you know what is best paired with what sauce etc. They offer great side dishes with the family combos and the portions are on the big side to you don't have to worry about leaving hungry. They have amazing fried rice dishes and the simple beverage drink has enough options for everyone in your group. I recommend the Gangnam Mule, refreshing and strong enough to enjoy. Bring your appetite and enjoy!",

My go-to's:  -Soondubu (spicy tofu soup) -Kimchi jigae (kimchi stew)  Lunch: -Lunch box special - bulgogi, teriyaki chicken or vegetable tempura All of their box specials are so yummy and contain a ton of food!  Service here is excellent. The longest I have had to wait for a table was like 20 mins and it was slammed packed with others waiting too.  I'll be back soon!",

    "text": "I was craving some Seoul food so I visited on Saturday 7-2-16 at 11:30 for a lunch with mah girl Jamie P. and her main squeeze. This restaurant is located on Spring Mountain between Decatur and Jones.    I was struck by the beauty of the place...everything is so modern and swanky yet industrial.  I just loved the design.  I think it's really awesome that they have free slushies and water for folks who are waiting.  How accommodating!   I also really liked their decor...like their retro Korean movie posters and advertisements.  They had a cool vintage TV in the men's room I just had to check out and I noticed they have free toothbrushes and mouthwash.  Yeah I went into the men's room.  I'm a rebel like that.    The five of us were seated at a small, round table and we had utensils and banchan all ready for us.   Our host for the evening  wasn't the friendliest and there was a severe language barrier.  One person in our party was accidentally seated in front of the grill controls and she nudged him out of the way.  I thought that was kinda rude...she should have asked him to move.  She wasn't able to answer most questions about the banchan and outright ignored some questions.  She needs a massage or a vacation or something...relax a little bit, lady!   We got the hobak beef combo for $89.99.  The menu says it feeds 3-4 people and we chose brisket, ribeye, and short ribs, and it also included bean stew, steamed egg, veggies, cheddar cheese, and ice cream for dessert. We were never offered anything to drink besides water.  I realized later that they never brought us the potato pancake that was supposed to come with the meal...no biggie tho.    I give the food five stars...hands down the BEST Korean food I've ever had. My favorite thing was the brisket with sushi rice and the salad made from bean sprouts.  There wasn't one thing I tried that I didn't like.  It's not a bad value for the money and I'd definitely go back!",

We came for a birthday today and we all ordered separately. For my boyfriend and I, we ordered the beef combo. It came with the angus brisket, a whole ribeye steak, and marinated skirt steak. The price is about $57.99 (before tax and tip)  Right when I took a bite of the angus brisket... It was a complete flavor bomb!!! I don't quite know how to explain it, but you can taste the quality vs. from a AYCE kbbq place.   Their banchan (side dishes) were also of quality as they have this bean sprout salad, an ice burg lettuce salad, kimchi, etc... The meat will come in order and they will cook each set of meat one by one. You get only one rice with your meal, so if you love rice... you'll probably have to spend that extra $2 to get another bowl.   P.S. This is the perfect place to go for your birthday. They play loud birthday music throughout the restaurant when the servers are ready to greet you and bring a dessert to the birthday celebrant lol.",

When we sat down, some of the side dishes were already set up for us.  I ordered the small family combo #1, but the waitress informed us the brisket was out, so we substituted another meat.  Out of the 4 meat selection that was brought my favorite was a spicy meat.  It was cooked on a mesh grill and came out perfect.  This dish alone made the experience worth it.  The 3 other meats were good but not amazing.  The pork belly I believe was on the tough side.  Did I enjoy the food and experience?  Yes.  Is it worth it for $40 per person compared to many already good $15 per person kbbq places out in California?  Probably not, but I don't regret trying it out at least once.",

It is such a fun experience much different than a hibachi style place. So much good food. Then dessert is an ice cream sandwich on thin rice cakes. (I'm not talking those rice cakes from Quaker you sadly eat when dieting) Already excited to go back to try the pork combo.",

I wanna come here every other day! we always order the beef combo with the brisket, ribeye and short ribs. I love pork too, so of course I had the pork cheek and premium pork belly. steam egg is wonderful, I can eat a whole one by myself! haha. brisket on sushi rice, never thought it could go together but it goes so well. ribeye cooked medium was just perfect.. nice and tender  short ribs with cheese was not a bad idea too! rice pop green tea ice cream with the azuki bean and kinako powder was... different but it was very yummy ! I thought the rice crackers wasn't gonna be crispy when it came out but it was! I love how the combo is just enough to eat. when you got to other Korean BBQ, it's usually all you can eat and you tend to order too much and then getting overly full but here at hobak.. it is just a perfect amount. can't wait to come back!",

We got seated the service started good we order the group for four people. The sides came out we were hungry so we all started eating it while one of the waitress was cooking are meat. She didn't seem happy with us. The meat was not done yet the sides were about out and we ask for more. It seem to make her mad that she had to get more. She told us to make sure the meat doesn't burn while she get more sides. She came back with only two sides when there were five little sides of stuff. We ask for more of the other stuff too. She finish the meat put it on are plates then added the next raw meat on the grill. She left then a different waiter came out to take over. We asked him if we could have more of the different sides. He then seem like he didn't want us to have more but went back there got only two sides. We all felt like they didn't want to service us and would not let us cook are own meat on the hot grill. Going to Korean restaurant is to cook your own meat on the hot plate to your taste but not at this place! They were rude with us and the price for this place is very expensive! This place is not worth the experience to eat Korean style!",

Our friends had recommended this place and it did not disappoint!   Service was excellent! We were seated immediately. Staff was very friendly from the beginning. Our server was a girl for like the first 5 minutes and it somehow changed to a guy for the remainder of the time we were there (even though we still saw the initial server working..). But the server that ended up helping us was friendly and on point! He was very proactive. There's this device on the table that you can use to call for help/order/etc but we didnt even need to use it! Our server was always checking up on us. He even asked us how well we wanted our meat done, which I thought was very considerate of him.   Meat was really good! The brisket is thinner than most places Ive been to, but I liked it. We ordered the family combo good for two people and o.m.g we couldn't even finish it! They give you a lot! It came with steamed eggs, soup, salad and tons of side dishes!   I also ordered the ice cream sandwich. They were out of green tea :( but I decided to order vanilla just to try it since a lot of yelpers mentioned it .. well I'm glad I ordered it anyway!! Yummy! My hubby ate a little of it (he's not big on desserts) and I happily ate the rest!!! It was really good. I highly recommend it!   I really enjoyed this place!! My husband and I will be back!! I recommend this place to anyone!!",

You can get more of any of the ban chan side dishes that come with your meal and my server cooked the meats to perfection. You can really taste the char from the charcoal that makes the flavor of the meat so delicious.   Coming to hobak with two others we ordered the large beef combo. It was way more than enough food for 3 and we struggled to finish.  If you want good Korean BBQ you have to come here.",

May I say that it may be even my favorite one? :O  I came here with a large group for lunch to celebrate Celina C's birthday on the weekend. We probably showed up around 11:30AM on a Saturday and there was no wait. The place was pretty empty but it picked up later in the afternoon.   To make things easier for our big group, we ordered 3 sets (2 beef and 1 pork) to share amongst the 8 of us. Turns out, it was a really good amount of food for everyone. So yes, it is NOT an AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ restaurant so don't come here expecting that!  The service is very prompt and friendly. They cook everything for you on the grill and are very courteous. Ban chan (side dishes) is your standard fare and is refilled constantly.   For dessert, the sets come with your choice of rice pop ice cream. They are ice cream sandwiches with rice crackers for the bread. It was quite delightful! They have 4-5 flavors so we ended up getting them all. (Picture below)  I would definitely recommend this place for those craving meat meat meat and will be coming back soon!",

Answer: Move  Note to self: I wish global warming would hurry up so I can move back to North Dakota and open a Korean BBQ joint.  Hobak is about as good as any Korean BBQ you're going to find in the US, no doubt the quality comes straight from Korea in Hobak's debut into the United States.   The quality of the food is beyond good, which is something you can see from the very moment it arrives on your table. When you order the ribeye, they send you a whole steak - who else does that? Awesome I tell you.  I have been introduced to several Los Angeles Korean BBQ places in the past year, all the way from K-Town to the O.C. and not a single one of them can come close to comparison on the quality of Hobak.",

    "text": "VISUAL AESTHETIC: 4.9/5 The location is at a visible area and is very unique, with a red and white awning that sort of gives a street food feel. Inside there is an old nostalgic essence that depicts Korea and how street food cart areas would be set up. The colors are drab with heavy pops of beautiful saturated red. There's are golden pots hung along the roofing of one section which is quirky and very cute. Overall the decor is quite nice, old movie posters and school books to banners with word play on different signs. However, during busy hours, the abundance of smoke is sort of annoying. The fans do little to really take away the large clouds floating amongst the restaurant and the ceiling in the venue is actually quite high.   FOOD: 4/5 I find this sort of strange and this is all opinion but Hobak does not serve barley tea, a common staple amongst Korean restaurants. However, the iced water is fine.  The side dishes were fresh but alright in taste. The green onion salad lacks the namesake, green onion but I don't mind the bean sprouts so this did not bother me much. I make the steamed egg at home and add a kind of fermented shrimp in to add flavor and because Hobak did not have this, the taste was quite bland. It is common for Korean barbecue restaurants to remove salt within recipes due to the salt that is added with marinated meat and dipping sauces.   The salad had a sort of black sesame dressing which was delicious but the iceberg lettuce was sparse and I find that most KBBQ restaurants give romaine lettuce. I asked for lettuce wraps but Hobak does not provide this service. I had to ask for a bowl of rice, which is uncommon at most Asian restaurants in general because rice is typically served with a meal.   I ordered the Family Combo 1 which includes the ribeye, pork belly, pork ribs (marinated), and beef (marinated). The cheese and grilled mushroom and sweet potatoes were a nice addition.   The meat was of good quality, however lacking in variety. I have been to various KBBQ restaurants in Las Vegas and found multiple ones that have gems which include options I haven't seen here in America unless you were out in LA.   SERVICE: 2/5 From the reviews, I saw that this location supposedly provides great service. I did not experience that in the slightest. The service was moderate and the workers were slightly attentive but I was very uncomfortable at the unfriendly behavior. What shocked me though, was the actions of one of the workers, Myunghee. I was appalled at not only the way she reacted towards me but her fellow employees.   One young man (today was his second day) came over to take our order and he was friendly and prompt, but in all honesty, had no idea how to explain the menu. This is understandable though, due to the short amount of time he has been working at Hobak. Myunghee had stopped by our table shortly after to take our order and when I explained I had already given it to another employee, she stomped off without a word and proceeded to interrogate the young man who took my order, asking him why he took our order and what it was that I ordered.   I was sort of shocked but dismissed it as her being in a hurry to serve other customers. Shortly after however, it was no longer busy due to it being after lunch time. I was further astonished when I watched as she barked orders at employees and yelled at individuals, including the new worker. At one point, she began telling off an employee in Korean even though I had just spoke to her in Korean moments before the occurrence.   This was rude, unprofessional, and embarrassing. Regardless if an employee has done something incorrectly, it is unacceptable to yell at them in front of a customer. Especially if a customer understands what you are saying. Regardless of this fact, people know how to read body language and it was very wrong to treat your colleague so unprofessionally in public. This is not only reflected poorly on Myunghee herself, but also on Hobak.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2.7/5 This is not a restaurant I will be returning to. I felt as though the interior was adorable and that the decor really reminded me of Korean nostalgia, however I cannot find myself enjoying the lack of variety and professionalism at this restaurant. I really wanted to enjoy this location due to the wide acclaim and the response amongst my peers, but the horrible service was not worth it.",

Our table of three ordered the beef family meal and it was plenty of food. The star of the show for me would have to be the ribeye and I was in awe of the cooking technique displayed by our experienced server. She kicked up the heat, seared both sides, slapped it with a stick of rosemary and hacked the rare slab into smaller pieces with a pair of kitchen sheers cooking all of the medallions to a perfect medium rare - absolutely delicious.   Be warned, this place does have a pretty hefty wait, but we found that it dies down a bit if you're willing to roll in later in the evening. I'll be back, Hobak!",

They have a great front patio with couches, misters, flavored icees, and ice cold water bottles that are complimentary while you wait. In Vegas this is a great idea because it can get crazy hot. Alot of Korean BBQ places make you do all the work for the food and charge an arm and a leg for normal tasting food. Not here! The service is phenomenal! They are very attentive and cook everything for you. We had a party of six and only had a small family combo. We had 2 people cooking our food on both grills at the table, while a third person (our waiter, who I sadly forgot his name) explained how everything was prepared. It was an amazing experience! That's just the service side too. The food is easily the best tasting Korean BBQ in town. We took my wife's parents with us who are from Korea but have lived in Vegas for over 45 years(they are in their late 60s). My father-in-law kept going on and on about how nothing else comes close to this place. How it was the best he has ever had! The meat melts in your mouth and all the side dishes are delicious as well! Everything is prepared perfectly. And if that isn't enough, they have individually wrapped toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash in the bathrooms! I mean come on! That is just amazing. I highly recommend, no I implore everyone who is a fan of great tasting food to check out Hobak Korean BBQ! Between the great service, amazing food, and great prices, you can't go wrong! You'll never want to try another BBQ spot!",

The only place I'm comfortable with getting the meat sweats from. I really can't stop thinking about the meat. So good. Even their side dishes - so good. Keep the eggs and Kim chi coming. Yum. But seriously, Hobak is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.

The second server - burnt the meat a little bit. Overall the food was really good, high quality meat w delicious marinade and unlimited banchan which is a plus. The servers are very attentive and pleasant. The only reason why I give four stars is due to the loud music and because the place wasn't well ventilated - my eyes kept getting watery.   I'll definitely be going back to try other items on the menu!",

I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but you need to take a break from the strip to come out to Hobak. It's def worth the 10 minute trip. I have been to kbbq places in Bay Area and a handful in LA, but i rank this place in my top 3. Hobak will fulfill you deep desires and give you meaty level of tranquility. The wait can be long since this place is super popular, but service is top notch. 10/10",

There are even pillars with coat hangers for consideration of guests during the colder times. All in all a very solid store with lots to look at. The ambiance is filled with a nice volume of hip hop/trap which made me want to pour up and head clubbing after my meal. The meat provided here is high quality and flavorful unlike meat that ive tasted before. The service tops it off. Servers that cook your whole meal for you. We were taken care of by a couple of different servers. Kim did a great job explaining the menu and cooked for us. Ryan checked on us periodically. Nana cooked and brought dessert over. It was a great experience where we were attended to by 5 people in total with the busser who were equally if not even more attentive. Recommend this place all the way!",

The atmosphere of the restaurant was so hip and fresh it kinda threw me back when I walked in because I wasn't expecting it. EDM music playing and decor was urban like. When we were seated at our table the Banchan was already waiting for us ready to eat. Julie  was awesome and so friendly. We had a great conversation while she was helping us cook the amazing quality Angus rib meat. Great customer service. I really enjoyed the easy approachable service they all have us when they would pop a squat at the edge of the table and become eye level with you to take your order. Nice touch. I'm definitely bringing more of my friends back to check out this LA feel restaurant.",

As we sat at our table we noticed all the servers wearing a very off putting \"dental mask\". I guess it was the first day they had to wear them, it made it look like everyone was sick. Anyway to the food, they offered a nice selection of ban chan but not as much as another place we go to,  my wife and I ordered the beef platter it was not bad but I guess one cut came with this sushi rice side. Expect that we didn't know which cut it was for so we after we asked what it was for the server said it was for the first meat he cooked, which was the brisket. We were aready on our last cut. Also we had no idea what the cheese was for and when we asked about that the server said it was for dipping meat in. (The cheese never melted fully, LOL). I did not like the metal chair or how loud it was. The atmosphere was not very welcoming. Overall it was not bad but not worth coming back to. Also another thing that was weird to me was the BIB, lol I was using it as a napkin till I realized what it was.",

The service was amazing and every single server, buser really looked like they care! The atmosphere is so fun and lively. Though they're so busy they put candles and brought out the cake and played a song and did a whole thing for the birthday girl... even an amazing surprise gift. It was our first time there and boy were we impressed. The Family meal (can't remember actual name) was absolutely perfect for 4 adults and a child. Every meat was marinated deliciously (my fav was the spicy pork belly but honestly it was all good. I think it was because I so impressed by it... I didn't actually think I'd like it!) and our main server Nana was so sweet and kind even though she was working her butt off! Thank you guys for a wonderful evening. Other restaurants need to look to you for an example of excellent food, service, and look! We will be back!",

    "text": "Giving two stars because I'm unable to give 1.5.   I was excited to drop in for a meal based on all the stellar reviews here, but came away very, very disappointed.   Meat -- Had the beef combo that had way too much fat and gristle (except for the brisket). Must have spat out every other piece into the napkin. The portions left a lot to be desired, and the quality of the meat was mediocre even with the fat/gristle issue aside.   Side Dishes (Banchan) -- Again meh at best. Seriously lacked variety and taste, and used low quality ingredients. Half-assed would be the best way to describe the banchans.   Service -- Ranged from decent to extremely poor depending who came by the table. Our original server went completely AWOL after the initial hello and didn't show up again till the very end to ensure that we weren't going to stiff her on the tip. Didn't bother to say thank you or bye as we were leaving even after making eye contact. Says a lot about her poor quality of service when the manager acted as our server the entire time to grill and cut our meats, and we had to flag down four (4) different servers to ask for refills on the water and salad. The place wasn't very busy with only half the dining hall occupied at 4:00 in the afternoon, so no excuse whatsoever for the lack of service there. We saw her roaming the hall and checking on the other tables around us. She simply refused to come and check on us for some odd reason. Completely inexplicable considering we tried to be polite and pleasant with her from the moment we sat down.   Overall Experience -- Didn't live up at all to the hype or the prices. Expected a lot better experience, but Hobak came up empty on all fronts. More than the mediocre quality of food, the crappy service we received would be the biggest blocker in our ever going back.",

    "text": "Visiting from southern California where Kbbq scene is very prominent, I was wondering how it is represented in Vegas. My foodie buddy and bff actually came here before and Hobak was highly recommended from her.  They are little bit furthur away on the Spring Mountain but I think it will be worth the trip. They have a fun and nostalgic 60s & 70s Korea theme for their restaurant. Those who doesn't know the culture, the uniforms the servers are wearing are the old school Korean uniforms (Kyoryun bok/Military Excercise wear).   My mom who was from that generation got a kick out of seeing things that reminded her of those days. Place is set up like the popular Kbbq franchise restaurants out in L.A (Kang Ho Dong Baekjung & Saemaul). Each table has the combo grill (gas & charcoal) and set up with the basic banchans they offer.  The banchan they served were good. From the simple salads to their pickled stuff for wrapping the meat. They do offer variety of meat choices and since we were there as a family, we ordered the Family Combo 1 (chadol/beef brisket, pork belly, marinated pork ribs w/bones, & spicy beef short ribs/boneless). It comes with seasoned rice to wrap your grilled chadol with, dwenjang soup, & steamed eggs. We ordered the large combo (serves 3 - 4 people). The quality of their meat were great.  The only bad thing for me was the spicy marinated short ribs. It was just way too spicy for me to eat. Service was friendly & prompt. They do all the cooking for you but when they get busy you may want to flip the meats to ensure they don't burn.  You get the ice cream sandwiches after your meal as dessert. They offer vanilla, strawberry, cookies & cream, & green tea/matcha for the ice cream flavors. Their ice cream is sandwiched between the crispy rice puffs (known as puntwighi - the classic Korean past time snack). The crispy & light puff was a perfect vessel for the ice cream. Great dessert to finish off the meal. So if you're looking for a Kbbq experience in Vegas, I guess Hobak will be a good place to come for the grilling meats. One thing that was not so good about my visit there was the flyer that was given to us as we set down on our table. Describing the theft incidents happening in that shopping center. Urging people not to leave valuables in the car. We were there early enough with the sunlight still out so didn't feel that unsafe there. However, if that's a repeat occurrence they should have a better remedy (either hire security or install surveillance cameras in the parking lot) for the patrons who are dining at their premise. Hope the bad people get caught soon so the rest of us can dine in peacefully without having to worry about any mishap.",

We didn't even finish the last round of meat and was able to take it home. The family combo comes with 3 pre determined meats that are listed on the menu and the last meat you choose from 1 of the 2 choices. In addition to the 4 meats it also came with about 4 or 5 appetizers,  2 sides, and an rice cake ice cream sandwich. All of the food was really good quality.    They cook the meat for you and the staff was very attentive, nice and personable. Although, i do feel they should have done a better job explaining the menu and the the food that came to the table. Asking us if it was our first time would have helped them identify if we needed further explanation about how the restaurant worked and the food options. Do ask for Crista, she was a good time as our waitress.   We only had to wait a few minutes to be seated at 6pm on a Friday night. Wasn't too busy at the a time. I thought it was a little strange for it not to be busy at that time on a Friday, but it was the day of the grasshopper apocalypse of the year 2019. (07/26/2019) We will rebuild.   The price comes out to be about the same as AYCE if you have 4 people. We only had 3. The difference between my experience with AYCE Korean BBQ and this place is you typically get many choices of meat as with this you don't. The trade off is the meats here are a little better quality, in my opinion.  The lack of meat choices is probably the only down fall with this place. Wish they had more flexibility with the meat choices on the family combos. For that reason I will be unlikely to return soon and instead seek out a another Korean BBQ restaurant with quality food and more meat choices.",

So we ordered the family combo and I believe a pork combo. The check came out to $263 which was surprising because the time we came before we ordered the 3-4 people and left full with a group of 6 and this time we ordered for 6 People and we all left unsatisfied which was pretty dissapointing because half of our group had a bad experience for their first time at hobak.   So here's the deal I wasn't a fan of any of the pork dishes we received they were chewy and hard at the same time. None of us Expressed that feeling but it was mutual because we all left it although we were hungry and my boyfriend took it for his puppers.   $40 is what the bill came out to for each of us which was insane on top was the tip. We all agreed that it wasn't worth it and we were better going off to gen.   I'm hoping that I can come again in the future and give this place the five they deserved during the first meal had with them but this one was on the dissapointing side.",

    "text": "One of our friends had this place posted the last time they came here, so we decided to try it for lunch too after Valley of Fire. We were starving after being in the sun all day and thought this was AYCE. We realized it wasn't but were too hungry so we said F it, order a Family Combo meal for 2 lol. It came with some sides, tofu soup, steamed egg and your entrees for $70:  -Angus Brisket -Hobak Pork Belly -Spicy B.L. Short Ribs -Aged Pork Ribs  Although looking at the final bill with a bottle of Sapporo and a bottle of Soju added in, it came out to be about $40/person. If you think about it, most of the AYCE places are around the same price, so don't get shocked to see the prices here on the menu. Trust me, it is TOTALLY WORTH IT. Not only do they cook everything for you, but the quality of the meat here is AMAZING. They even have little buttons on the tables to call for service or when you're ready for the check. Don't forget to brush your teeth after your meal too LOL!   Besides the hostess being a complete B-word, this place is almost close to perfect! Definitely stop by if you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Very solid and very popular Korean BBQ joint.  Not sure if this is typical for many of the korean barbecue places around town but they will cook your food in front of you which takes the stress out of burning the good quality meat that you order.  This place definitely reminded me of when I went to Seoul in the past with the wide assortment of initial dishes that are provided.    I've been here twice with groups of 5 and 6 people respectively.  I had the beef platter and the quality of the meat was excellent and 2 platters was the right amount for the group.  The second time I went, we split both the beef platter and the pork one.  The pork is noticeably fatter and heavier so if you enjoy pork, definitely have to try that one.  It's definitely not cheap but you get what you pay for and I'm happy to report the quality is excellent.  There are a variety of dishes if you get the platter such as steamed egg and a type of broth (DIdn't get the exact name) but both were delicious and could be ordered as many times as one wished.  Dessert at the end (An ice cream sandwich) was very good as well with your standard mixture of asian inspired flavors (Green tea, red bean, etc).   I did take away a star because the area is shady.  While we were eating, my coworker had his car window smashed and his backpack stolen because he parked in an area that was not well lit and unfortunately there were no security cameras.  Happened to several groups that night and apparently happens often enough that the owners have a sign on the door saying to watch out. I realize it wasn't the owner's fault but surely if this happens enough, some extra cameras or security could be provided so people don't have to constantly worried about their stuff being stolen while eating?",

    "text": "We've been to several KBBQ restaurants and this one was definitely different and fun!  This place is not AYCE, and they do cook the food for you at your table.    My family of 5 ordered a 3-beef combo (comes with salad, soup, and egg dish ), and also ordered fried rice and cheesy corn.  All the beef barely fed my 3 teenagers and so we ordered another brisket dish.  All the standard sides were pretty good.  I really liked the fried rice and also the egg dish that came with the combo.  My daughter ate all of the cheesy corn before I could even try it.  The balls of sushi rice was inhaled by my older teenage son.  I didn't care for the soup but my husband liked it.  Ice cream was also included with the combo.  Although the table was large, all of the plates took up a lot of room.  It seemed to be a constant struggle to find tabletop real estate for anything.  We ended up consolidating dishes just so that they could remove some plates off the table.  That part was a little frustrating.  Oh- Beware of popping embers from the bbq!   The next table had a chunk of a glowing ember pop and fly out of their bbq!  Luckily it missed the ladies that were sitting at that table and it missed my husband.  The ladies and I were looking at each other in disbelief.  I didn't mention it, but I'm assuming the ladies told their server?  A fun place with great & happy servers!  The (3-beef) combo alone was not enough to feed my husband and 3 teenagers, but the food was really good.  It was a nice dinner out, away from the strip.",

This is not AYCE. This is also a spot where the staff cooks for you! A few things that are unique about this place: 1. When you first come in they have free slushies. Occasionally they also have snacks such as popcorns. This really makes a different during high peek times when wait times are long. 2. Bathrooms have toothbrushes and toothpaste for convenience. 3. They have this rice krispy ice cream dessert that I've never personally had at any other place. 4. Steamed egg! Whatever they do to make this here makes it significantly more flavorful than any other restaurant.  This place is a definitely must try and will continue to keep coming here.",

It also feels a little smoky when it's crowded and lots of grills are going. You'll definitely leave smelling like meat. I think that's why there's a spray bottle of Febreze by the door (seriously).   The staff are OK. Not the warmest and friendliest but pretty attentive.  No complimentary tea with the meal, but they leave a plastic bottle of water at the table.   They have a variety of different meal packages including meats and sides and soup and steamed eggs.   Staff will bring out the meat and grill it for you. We tried a variety of meats - I cannot remember which ones exactly - but they all were excellent. Extremely tender and clearly of high quality.   You will get an ice cream sandwich for dessert with the meal packages too which is a cool way to end a meal of assorted hot meats.   Definitely try Hobak for high quality BBQ!",

I also like to bring my guests here for different Vegas experience.  A couple of tips:  Arrive between 5 and 5:30 to avoid long wait. For best experience, come in party 8. They put you at the big table with 2 grills. Order one Pork and one beef combo for each grill, so the staff does not have to keep changing the grids and shorten the wait time. If you are at the tables with one grill, order pork first. Especially the pork belly takes long time to cook, order that first and save room for thin cut meat later. Nothing worse than waiting for that delicious pork belly!  I highly recommend their stake tartar. The sauce is unmatched anywhere.  Tell your guests don't fill up with soup or steam eggs first. Best yet, tell the staff to bring those out last! My guest keep re-ordering the steam eggs and soups they ate very little meat. Good for my pocket book but missing the point at Hobak!",

This is not an AYCE place but you will notice the difference in quality of their meat. Usually I will get the combo and the small is good enough to share between 3 people.  All of their dishes are good but the spicy Angus short rib is one of my favorites. They give you so many side dishes and the hobak sauce is so good to dip the non marinaded meats in.   They don't just give you rice but everyone can get a bowl of rice when you order the combo so just ask for it. Best thing is, you don't even have to cook the food, the server cooks everything for you.",

    "text": "\"Sharing Our Best\" Hobak's motto is something I can appreciate as someone who appreciates finer yet affordable things in life. I've eaten at several AYCE Korean BBQ and non-AYCE places, and I was pleasantly impressed by 3 of the 4 types of meat that we ordered here. Hobak is a non-AYCE restaurant that serves premium Heritage pork and black angus beef. Other places serve beef tongue, chicken, bulgogi, but this place focuses on fewer items. It's great to know that some restaurants will try to narrow down and perfect their craft specialties.   Hobak is located on Korean town area off Spring Mountain and St. Jones St. They're typically opened from 11AM-1AM. 14 of 24  hours opening is really awesome for people craving korean bbq. Directions: It's located off the corner of a strip mall near KFC. The pricing is somewhat leaving the $$ to $$$ as many of the combinations range from $55/$64 for small to $90/$103. Yes, that's as pricy as AYCE. However, when you consider the service that they cook for you and the quality of meat, it's worth it.  Atmosphere: Upon entering the restaurant, you'll see a table with Frebreze spray that says \"leave as if you were never here\" and a mini kids arcade.  I could tell already that this was a hip restaurant. +1 star for trying to be innovative and accommodating for customers.  Inside you'll see their small tables set up on oil barrels and small vents that you can pull up and down to help suction smoke. I wish that their tables were a bit larger to accommodate all the banchan(small dishes) for the group and wish there were more tvs. (4/5)  Service: For a busy night on Sunday, I was pleasantly impressed with how efficient they were bringing out the first banchan and taking our order. They have multiple servers coming to cook the meat, refill banchan, and help with other requests. (4/5)  Meat: I really enjoyed the skirt steak and the short ribs as they were well marinated and usually cooked to my liking. I think the server had such a difficult time seeing in the darkroom whether the meat was cooked medium rare or medium. They really tried flipping the meat quickly back and forth as they checked on other tables. My least favorite was probably the pork belly as it was cut up in minuscule pieces and the spicy beef.  (4/5)  Banchan: The servers were so slow in delivery these to us when we asked for additional ones. We had to politely request for two of everything when the table was empty and delivery was slow. I appreciated the green leaves, bean sprouts, daikon, and the unique cold kimchi soup (slushie). I think that they could have a bit more variety compared to other places I've been at. (3/5)  Ending: Ice cream? Yes, please! I see that many people ordered the green tea, however, I was not a huge fan of that as I did not smell or taste any tea flavor. However, the chocolate was surprisingly good. To top it off, I when I went to the bathroom, I found out that they had mouthwash, toothpaste, and a free toothbrush so you can leave feeling refreshed.  (3/5)",

Food tastes great, I recommend trying the Soju, especially if you've never tried it. It's a Korean liquor that tastes very sweet and like whatever the flavor fruit you pick.  I've been to other Korean BBQ places and so far this is the best one!",

    "text": "This is my very first time having Korean bbq in Vegas and let me say this, this is the best Korean bbq spot I've ever had when it comes to quality of meat. No this is not an AYCE Korean bbq spot so don't expect that here. One thing I have to say though is the side dishes aren't good but the meat is amazing. We didn't have to cook the meat by ourselves but had the servers cook for us. We ordered the Hobak family combo 3 small for 2 people. A bit of regret because we could have eaten more. The meat was so tender and not overly marinated. I've never really had kbbq that tasted so good.  Definitely recommend to everyone who enjoy delicious quality meat but I think ordering the large can make you full than ordering the small.  Lastly, when you finish the bbq, they give you ice cream sandwich on a rice cracker which was pretty good. Will come back when I'm in Vegas again.",

Hobak serves Angus beef, flavorful pork belly,  and everything else in between.  All the proteins were super tender and flavorful.  The staff was really nice and love that they have a call button on the table to call the servers over.   Hobak is NOT an all you can eat place.  But the family meals are more than enough to feed a family of 4.  We ordered the beef combo with a side of pork belly.   And none of the food disappointed.   Servers cook all the food and I loved that they served sushi rice with wasabi with the thin sliced brisket.  It was super tasty.   The flank steak was killer.  Plus you get a choice of 2 flavors of the ice cream sandwich dessert.  Flavors include mint chocolate, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla and cookies and cream.  We were so stuffed we barely had enough room to eat the dessert.   But of course we polished those off too.  Definitely will be back.",

It was juicy and tender and melted in your mouth!  combo also came with sushi rice with wasabi (so you can make little sushi with your beef)  also as dessert they gave us ice cream - 2 flavors since we ordered large size.  we left the place full and satisfied and we loved the place so much that we had to come back before we left on sunday night.  this time around we skipped combo and ordered individual meat dishes portions were similar but you probably do save few bucks doing combo. we wanted to try different type of meat that we wanted, so this time we ordered Marinated skirt steak, aged short ribs and boneless short ribs.  AMAZING.  again, we left this place full and very satisfied. I'm still dreaming about the aged short ribs because it was just THE BEST I've ever had in the states.   highly highly recommend this place. very close from the strip just Uber/Lyft it's like less than 10 mins away!!! so worth it!",

Hobak has plenty of combo actions for your carnivore pleasure. My go to as of late have been the all beef combo. It starts with brisket, then a rib eye, and then marinated short ribs. There are plenty of sides available, and all of them are delicious, especially the kimchee and the spicy salad. One of the highlights is the fried ice cream at the end. It is the perfect dessert to end the meal. Also, if you are a beer drinker, then I definitely recommend a big bottle of Hite to wash down the delicious meat.   As for the service, the staff here is phenomenal. They are always there to ensure that your meat is cooked the way you'd like. They also ensure that everything is safe with the BBQ grill, and ensure to check on you when you need more drinks or more side refills.   Hobak is always a treat and never fails to deliver an extremely satisfying meal.",

Every time I've been, I've felt like the seating arrangements are a bit chaotic and cramped compared to other KBBQ places where I have my own personal booth. With how popular this place is, it would help to have a bigger area.   It depends on what you're looking for. The meat here is the best KBBQ in Vegas, but comes with it is a more noisy restaurant. If i'm looking for a more private and intimate environment, I would go to Magal. The service here is 5/5 and overall this place is 5/5. I would bring someone here especially if they're trying KBBQ for the first time and you want to impress them.",

Took about 30 minutes to get a table.  No big deal.  Took about another 20 minutes to get a server to take our order.  Ugh.  Meat quality is above par, But side dishes all tasted sweet.  Sugar doesn't make everything better.  Servers come around occasionally to cook the meat.. personally, i think that takes away from krn bbq experience.  Dessert was ice cream sandwiches in puffed rice snacks.  Very tasty.    Too much sugar and poor service..",

Going forwards, I will always pick better meat and a cook over all you can eat. It is a no brainier when the prices are comparable and you will leave full regardless.  Attention to detail is what makes this place stand out. They serve sushi rice with particular cuts, you don't have to get a bowl of unseasoned rice. I appreciated the ice cream sandwich at the end of the meal. It wasn't a throw away bowl of ice cream, and seemed appropriate after all the meat. They even have disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste in the bathroom in case you are on a hot date.   I want to point out how helpful it is to have someone else cook the food. You get to enjoy the meal and your company without worrying about tracking the clock and remembering how long a particular cut should stay on the grill. My hunch is that they have electronic timers somewhere in the restaurant which notify the server when eat dish needs attention. You also get call buttons on the table itself.",

Well that is until now, this meal and experience blew me out of the water.  1. This place clearly invests in it's staff, they were incredibly on point, knowledgeable and with nothing but upbeat and positive attitudes. 2. Banchan (The little dishes you get at Korean BBQ) - I have never been a big fan of these anywhere I go. Not at Hobak, the potato pancakes, the sushi rice to put your meat on, the two kinds of soup, the kimchi and the egg omelet, the vinegar jalepenos and leaves to wrap meat in. They were all incredible and they just keep on bringing them. 3. The experience - My guess is this place trains their staff for a month before they are servers. They make the experience over the top and take care of you the entire time. Just lean back, hang out with your friends and enjoy, these guys have you covered.  This is my first time reviewing a Korean BBQ joint because it's the first time I ate at one that I had something positive to say.",

Brian was our hype man. you my boy, blue!  I couldn't eat anymore because I was so full. but according to my sister and best, the dessert was fantastic. you get plenty of flavor options for the ice cream.   the bathrooms also provide you mouthwash and disposable toothbrushes and toothpaste to stay fresh and clean. dope.",

We told the server to bring out the cake for the surprise and they literally bought out the cake in the Walmart bag that it came in. Epic fail  way to ruin the cake, so they took it back and brought it the the right way, and when we ask for the box that the cake came in the server thrown it away.

The table was already set up with the side dishes and flame going.  My mother and i really liked the pancake. We got a beef combo order which included brisket, boneless short rib, and marinated short rib. After finishing, we ordered another combo with more brisket, short rib, and marinated skirt steak. They came with the bean paste soup and steamed egg. Also unlimited sushi rice on the side.   We really loved the steamed egg and soup. My husband's favorite was the brisket, my favorite was the boneless short rib, my little sister's fave was the marinated short rib. But everything was very well enjoyed by all of us.   Our waiter for the night was Kevin. He was very cheerful and pleasant to talk to. He explained all the meats and helped with suggestions. He definite made our first visit a great first impression.   We will for sure be back in the near future, going to bring my father here for upcoming father's day with the family.   Thanks, Kevin!",

He just ignored our question and yelled you get 4 choices....He was rude and he really ruined our experience.

I would give them 5 stars, but could only give them 4 stars because of not accepting reservations. I can understand this is their business concept, but to someone like me who works by appointment, I can't give a perfect score to a restaurant that doesn't take reservations...sorry.   I probably wouldn't go back as the wait would probably be over an hour during earlier dining hours and my time is just too valuable to be waiting.",

    "text": "This is the BBQ place we always go to since we found it a couple months ago.  Well, we went to one other one, Magal BBQ.  There is no comparison to this spot.  It is a little far from Rhodes Ranch, but it's while worth the drive for me.  My husband gets a little lazy going out anywhere that way.    We chatted to one of their server and he mentioned they have to go through one month of training on how to prepare your meat.  That is why the consistency of all the staff are pretty good.  They do an amazing job.  There was only one time out of the 6 times we've been here our last dish was overcooked.  I believe they were in the middle of switching shifts and we were chatting to our friends and didn't eat until they mentioned to us the pork was ready to eat.  We always order the Family combo 1-2 people or the 3-4 people when we go with friends.  We order the fresh soju as well, I like it slushy style.  It usually stays cold until the end of the meal.  The dessert at the end is dangerous.  I can eat so many of them.  The sweetness is just right.  We can't decide if we like the vanilla or green tea better.  The green tea isn't as sweet as the vanilla.  If you're looking for a fruity flavor, I would go for the mango.  The strawberry is good too.  Well, those are the 4 flavors we had.  I'm not sure if there is another flavor.  Overall, I would recommend this spot to everyone.  Oh yeah, be aware of their birthday celebration sprinklers. lol",

This place is kind of hard to spot amidst the cluster of businesses and restaurants on Spring Mountain road, it's in a corner.  Service: the staff here is very attentive and they work together to provide a great experience. Usually when I've had Korean bbq they bring the meat and you cook it yourself. Here, the staff cooks the meet in front of you at your table. They cook it perfectly to your liking.   Food: we had the beef combo with skirt steak, brisket, and steak all of which were amazing they bring you a tons of side dishes that come with the combo. Which is only $37   The only complaint I have is that it's so good that it's extremely busy! Our wait was 45 minutes.",

    "text": "Real friends, how many of us?  How many of us, how many jealous?  11 of us and the rest jealous.   How could they not be? Hobak bumps the treshold of Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, its hard to find a place that is friendly to the customer, quick with service, 80s like vibe, spacious, and affordable. A great test is how a new restaurant handles a large party and Hobak jumped over the challenge. Waited for 15 minutes for my party to arrive, and rather than do nothing the staff got the tables ready for their hungry guests. Our party settled for 3 Hobak Family Combos ($84.99/ea minus 10% for lunch) which comes with 9 dishes plus the banchan. The side dishes were alright, but the kimchi was delicious, fermented just enough for the crunchiness, or one hunna fire emojis, whatever the kids say these days. The meat items of the combo are the marinated skirt steak, aged short ribs, boneless short ribs (has nuts), and grilled spicy pork belly. The server took care of our table, notifying us which dish had nuts and accommodated by giving my table larger portions of the nut free dishes.   If you were to going to do a la carte the grilled spicy pork pork is a must. It comes in a bowl and then warmed up on the charcoal grill, spicy sauce mixed into the bowl, then grilled to flaky masterpiece. Optionally you can dip the masterpiece into a cheese fondue that is melted in a ramekin next to the spicy pork. Texture reminds me of rib eye from a cheese steak.   The meal set with 4 people came out very similarly to the AYCE counterparts, but they don't have the quality, smokey grilled meats, cleanliness, or friendly quick wait staff. I will take Hobak over any AYCE any day because when I'm here I feel like Pablo.  EDIT: most importantly they have disposable toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouthwash so you can leave refreshed, who does that? Real friends",

The two hostess girls at the front are completely clueless on their job, sitting 6 separate parties who came in after us even after I told them 3 times we are willing to sit at two separate tables.  Never once did they ask us if it's okay for them to sit people coming in after us or give us an update on how much longer our wait will be. She quoted me 35-40 minutes which is fine but at around 60 minutes and after she sat parties who haven't been waiting as long as us,  she should have came and inform us what is going on.  The manager was very apologetic and kind but the two hostess girls never once apologize or admit they made a mistake. Advice for the owner: you should hire someone competent to be at the front, especially at such a busy place.",

Only being about a 5 minute walk over, we found the place and to our surprised some of the workers are actually korean! You are first greeted by a FREE SLUSHIE MACHINE, which for the current heatwave in Vegas was blessing and a half. We were quickly seated by one of the host and were given menus.   Looking around the restaurant you get a very authentic feel and you also see the butcher in the back cutting up everything fresh. Very good visual for any BBQ-type restaurant to have.   Never being here before we opted for Family Combo 1 which included a variety of meats which are cooked right in front of you. Being based in Toronto I was not expecting much as korean BBQ is more common than korean people themselves. When the meat came I automatically knew it was some quantity meat and that this was going to be a good meal. I'm not going to go on full detail but this meal probably was if not my favourites , one of my favourite meals in Vegas.   The service that is provided as well as the quality of the entire meal does not match up to the no frills price they charge. If I could bring this entire restaurant back home I would.",

    "text": "Hobak in chinese letters means to get together and share great things. It was indeed, great things that we shared on a Sunday night. Hobak Korean BBQ is a popular KBBQ chain from Korea that made its arrival in Las Vegas just few weeks ago. Hobak definitely set the bar high and is easily my top favorite for kbbq.   Lots of banchan offered just like any other kbbq. I'm usually not a fan of banchan at other places because they are usually bland and flavorless. I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed all the banchan here. We got the set menu which was for 3-4 people. It was little bit less than $100 and came with brisket, boneless short ribs and skirt steak, along with two desserts (green tea/vanilla ice creams).   Brisket is always my favorite and brisket here exceeded my expectation. Quality was like no other, perfect cut and super juicy. They offer two sauce options, the Hobak sauce (soy sauce + vinegar?) and salt. Server recommended me to dip the brisket in Hobak sauce, then to eat it with their vinegar rice. Please do, because it was the best I've had.  Boneless short rib was also good. Amazing marbling and was tender and juicy. Skirt steak was marinated and again, melt in your mouth tender.   Lastly, their green tea and vanilla ice cream. It is ice cream sandwich and reminded me of Japanese monaca ice cream I used to eat all the time.   Server we had was Andrea and she was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. I can see myself coming back here again and again. Believe the hype.",

    "text": "In search of a good Korean BBQ place in town, I've found myself liking some places upon the first two visits only to be disappointed by next few visits due to decline in cleanliness, service and food quality. Hobak seems to be very promising though mainly because of the superb quality of meats they serve: black angus with fantastic marbling.  Banchan on the table. We got the beef combo and also ordered spicy pork belly. They cook your food for you. Our server was Nana and she was very friendly. Excellent service.  My enthusiasm over brisket has died over the past few years but I still get it because it cooks the quickest. But oh my! Hobak's brisket was absolutely delicious. Rib eye and marinated skirt steak...mmmmm...tender and flavorful angus beef. The combo came with bean paste stew, steamed egg, and rice pop ice cream.  A word of caution when eating the rice pop ice cream though is don't inhale or talk before biting into it, otherwise, you'll choke on peanut powder that's in this ice cream sandwich - True story! We've all had ice cream sandwiches but this has something new to offer. Instead of a cookie, brownie or macaron (which is also a cookie)...*snooze* your vanilla or green tea ice cream is in between puffed rice crackers schmeared with red bean paste and dusted with peanut powder.   They have a pull down vent that sucks the smoke but you'd still smell like food when you leave just not as bad as most places. They change the pan/grill every time they cook a type of meat. Say goodbye to crusty, burnt grills. And they use charcoal to cook the meat which adds a nice smokey flavor.   Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. I absolutely have nothing to complain about.",

We ordered the beef combo. We had brisket, angus steak, and marinated beef ribs. It came with bean paste soup, steamed egg and ice cream sandwiches! The sides were pretty fantastic too! All came to about $65 some dollars.   Everything was perfect. The meats were grade A and super tender! Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the beef ribs just because there was so much fat on it. Didn't bother me too much to where I didn't eat it tho. lmao. The guy cooked our food so well! So good! The meat melted in my mouth! Also, don't be afraid of that cheese melting on your grill! Dip that meat in there and taste a bit of heaven! DO IT. Hah  Best customer service. Didn't get the girl and guys name but they were so cute and funny. The guy kept saying \"Ay yai yai\"  and it was the cutest thing! Great personality with amazing service.   ONLY thing that bugged me was that they didn't have a choice of mixed items that was NOT marinated. They had a pork and beef combo but they were all marinated. I'm pretty basic and I've been to every single Korean bbq here in town and every other city I've visited and they always have just the regular brisket, pork belly and chicken and they didn't have that simple combo. My favorite thing to order at a KBBQ is intestine but I didn't see it on the menu? I was sad. I can't complain though, I was still satisfied and that pancake was frikkin bomb. Same with that ice cream sandwich! Ugh!   OH OH, the inside gave you that Korean street/food cart authentic feel too. Wonderfully designed with that kpop playing in the background! I felt like F(x) was going to come out and start dancing and entertain us while we ate! Hah.   Anyway, just here and try it. *Thumbs up!*",

I've tried many more across the city and even when we visit Cali. Still, Hobak sets the tone and keeps the bar high for my KBBQ preference. I've narrowed down my top 3 KBBQ restaurants in Vegas, and Hobak continuously remains at #1. This includes #1 even throughout the ones I've had in Cali.   I rave about this place to all of my friends and social media followers. So far, everyone who has gone under my referral has reported back how much they loved their experience and the food here as well. Randy is our favorite server. He's like another homie at the table with us.   I'm impatient when it comes to waiting for food. But I will wait that hour or a little more here. Deem me crazy, but as long as I'm not dying of starvation, it's worth the wait!! From the banchan to the meat quality, the service from beginning to end, is like no other KBBQ anywhere. It's also an added bonus that there is no corkage fee. My Wineaux ass is happy because I love my red wine paired with my beef.",

The quality of the meat was superb and the service was excellent(I've only had kbbq in cali where you cook everything yourself, so it was a nice change to have someone cook for me while I was dehydrated and hungover).   You get a much better value here than on the strip.  Will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Good, but not great, and definitely NOT 5 stars. The reviews for this place are heavily inflated because this is Las Vegas and there are very poor options for Korean food in this city. This is a 3-star establishment at best and tries hard to copy Kang Hodong Baekjeong in Los Angeles.  Meat: Decent quality but the marinated short rib was extremely sweet and the brisket was tough. The ribeye is the star of the show and I highly recommend selecting this option if you get the beef combo. The ice cream sandwich at the end of the meal was excellent.  Service: Attentive, but awkward and borderline annoying. The server is constantly at the grill turning the meat which makes it weird trying to have a conversation with your party. I put one piece of meat on the grill and the server made a comment about doing that which annoyed me because if I'm paying for the meal then I can cook it how I want.   Banchan: This is where it goes south, the banchan is disappointing and borderline gross. The salad had some weird ranch dressing that doesn't belong in KBBQ ever, the dipping sauces were off (bland), no kimchi pancake, and the side dishes were all low quality.  I'm from Los Angeles and travel extensively for work so this place sits in the middle of the pack for KBBQ. For travelers from other states who don't have access to good Korean food, this will be super amazing to you. To the rest of us from LA-- it's just slightly above average.",

I got the family combo which came with thinly sliced beef, angus beef and short ribs. I shared it with two others but the menu says it could be enough for 4 as well. The total for that is about $93.00, which is normal. Korean BBQ in general is pretty spendy.  But I'm not giving a 5 star for the food but for the place it's self, the staff there are wonderful. They're cooking your food to perfection on how you want it, they pay great attention to you and whatever you need you'll get it within seconds. I also love the ambiance, the decor and feel of the restaurant is as if you are in the streets of Korea.  My group came there on Halloween night and love how full out they go. Everyone dressed up in costumes and the whole place was decked out in Halloween decors which is awesome.  I also love how they provide toothbrush and toothpaste and mouthwash in the bathrooms, as well as phone chargers. If you're waiting for your table they even have little snacks like popcorn to offer for those who are just super hungry while they're waiting!  But like I mentioned before I'm giving a 5 star for the great service they offer!! Keep it up.",

The wait is horrendous of course but expected, 30 min turned to 1 hour and 10 min. So dont come here hungry. Lol  The prices and quantity is expected as well very small, its not an all you can eat joint and dont expect alot of meat. We had to order another plate pf meat and cold noodles on top of our combo. We told our server maybe we shpuld have ordered the 3 to 4 people portion, he said no its too much food. The portions are really small, the pictures are deceiving. Our server was in a rush on everything, our food, the cooking and when we said we want to order more meat he kinda got dissappointed. Lol.   We had to ask for cups for our water, more water, rice, napkins pretty much all the basics. Top it off with a piece of hair on our salad which we pointed out and he just said oh I get you a new one. No sorry, oh my gosh, nothing.   Well I tried it and everyone seems to give this place a 4 and 5 star which Im sure at times deserves it. Its just not this time.",

    "text": "Ordered the beef combo for two and I wasn't too impressed. Ordered the combo with the aged rib eye and aged short ribs options. The brisket and ribeye was ok didn't really wow me because it wasn't flavorful or juicy or seasoned as other Korean Bbq places where I've had better. The short ribs were better but it didn't make up for the other meats.   Service was great and the server answered all the questions I had.  But I ordered a refill for my Kim chi and that took about 3 reminders within 20 minutes to get to the table.   The dessert didn't wow me either and I am a big dessert person. The green tea ice cream inside was good but not a fan of the flavorless puff rice outside, I'd rather just eat the ice cream.   The server also mentioned a current promotion where a Yelp review would reward you with a free dessert or gift which turned out to be a water bottle so I felt like it was kinda a bribe for a good review. Now to me that promotion kinda explains why my experience didn't live up to the hype of all the reviews on here. Hobak won't be my first choice for Korean Bbq.   So... I gave this place a second try and went with a group of my friends. We ordered the family meal and it was better than the combo I got on my first visit. The meat was marinated well and all the items that were included were tasty and delicious. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because the servers made the meat burn really bad. And the server was kinda annoyed that my friend choose to cook the meat herself cuz they kinda forgot bout our grill since we were seated at the bigger table with 2 grills.",

We have tried numerous other korean bbq restaurants all over the Vegas  area while some are good none of them seem to have the same quality and service as Hobak. There brisket is second to none and the marinated skirt steak is to die for! A small combo is more than enough for two people as I'm a big eater and am stuffed by the time I leave. If you come with a larger party of 3 or 4 I would suggest getting two small combos rather than a large. It's only a few dollars more but you can get a wide variety of different meats when doing it that way.   We are once a week+ visitors to Hobak and our go to is a small beef combo with brisket, boneless short ribs & marinated skirt steak.",

The staff was amazing to say the least. They cooked the food and told us some of their ways in eating each type of beef and the sushi rice was great too! The atmosphere in the restaurant was casual and just the layout of the place itself is just nice. The restaurant is fairly new open for only 7 months. I asked when are your most busy hours they said, Friday-Saturday 7-8, if you're going to go those hours, there's a chance you might wait 30-hour. I went around 9:30pm on a Tuesday and it was still a little busy. The place again didn't have smoke everywhere. The vents that come down are very convenient and definitely helps with the smoke. At the end of the set they give you ice cream and it's an ice cream sandwich and you decide which flavor you would like. I took the strawberry but in all honesty I think the ice cream was my least favorite in this whole experience. I would definitely come back! If you're craving KBBQ check this place out! It's a little expensive but it's all worth it!",

I literally have waited over 2 hours with no complaints, because I thought it was worth it. Then I noticed service was going downhill. We had a grill that put out too much gas which made my food inedible. They moved us but didn't replace the bad food that we had cooked and didn't eat. Another time they ran out of rice and never brought it over once cooked but gave the table next to us rice. I had to ask 4 separate times for rice and still never got it. Another time they just expanded their adult beverage menu and we were so excited but then they didn't have any of the drink ingredients for the 5 different attempts to order and the only person that knew how to make the drinks available wasn't there. 3 strikes, you're out Hobak.",

The aged short ribs are AMAZING and my family loved the ice cream dessert. It is a different experience from any other Korean BBQ restaurant I've eaten at in Vegas. I also think it's awesome that they cook it to perfection for you.   If the food or service wasn't enough to set them apart, another neat thing they offer is a free \"treat\" while you wait or after you eat. It's near the entrance. The first time I ate here, they had free bottled water. Other treats I've tried are flavored slushes and popcorn.   This is definitely my favorite Korean BBQ place in town!",

The decor and the ambiance are quite unique from the regular Korean eateries.  There was a short wait when we came in. When we were taken to the table, all the side dishes were laid out and ready for us. The menu is quite simple, only beef and pork and side dishes. There is no chicken nor seafood on the menu.  For vegetarians, I guess you can get by as well.   We ordered the family combination for 4 people. There were four different meats - skirt steak, short ribs, spicy short ribs and pork ribs. the waiter cooked on the table top in front of you. The meats were all of different distinct flavors, very delicious and tasty. Quality was excellent and the quantity was more than enough.  Included in the dinner were various Korean side dishes that can be refilled on request. A steam egg casserole and a bean paste soup also came with the dinner. For deserts, rice cake ice cream sandwich, absolutely delicious was also part of the meal. For $89 for 4 for such quality and quantity is definitely worth a 5 star.   My two negative comments are: 1. The music was way too loud, making casual conversation a wee bit difficult. 2. The spicy pork was good but also too spicy.   As with all Korean food, where garlic is used for marinating, there is always a breath issue after consuming a Korean meal. This establishment provides mouth wash, tooth brush and etc for their customers. The first I have ever seen in a Korean restaurant.   Wait staff was courteous and knowledgeable.   Very impressed even with a couple negatives.",

Hobak was the Korean BBQ game changer that I've been impatiently waiting for in Vegas. Sorry to other KBBQ places, but none of y'all could even compare to the BBQ game in LA. But Hobak, oh dear Hobak, you have finally taught the lesson that we've been waiting for and these other places can have several seats (ooo yea I said it..).   Before you continue on, be aware that this place gets crazy busy and you need to prepare yourself for a wait. Be patient my hungry one, because it will be very worth it. Oh and help yourself to some complimentary slushy while you're waiting.  Let's talk the interior. Every KBBQ place should just automatically come with ventilators that lower so you don't walk out of the restaurant like you were on the grill yourself. The interior of the restaurant has a sort of \"we're like Asian hipsters, but not 100% cause we really don't give a f, what matters the most is the meat we're about to feed you\" feel. You know like they didn't go full out hipster with the decorations, but just enough to make you feel like this is a hip place to eat it. Honestly this place could be in a box (a clean box), and I'd still eat there. Because it's not the cute, hip decor, or ambiance that has me returning here 3 times in 2 weeks... it's that aged short rib.  The 3 times I have visited, it's been the exact same: Hobak Beef Combo - angus brisket, angus rib eye, HOBAK AGED SHORT RIBS. You CANNOT miss the short ribs if you can't tell that its the MVP already. I could honestly say that this is probably the best KBBQ joint I've been to, and I mean LA has plenty of worthy places, but it's all in the way they marinate their meat here. They don't cut it until it's ordered and it's fresh to death, every day. The price may seem steep ($55 for 2) but you get 3 meats, unlimited rice, salad, side dishes, soup, fluffy egg thing, and..dessert. Oh. Em. Gee. The dessert. Green tea or vanilla ice scream sandwiched between two rice crackers? Great, now I'm craving this place...   As far as service goes, its been great with each visit (especially when you have the same server all 3 times - Hi Randy!). They help with the cooking and are very attentive.  My last recommendation would be to try this place out for lunch since the menu is 20% off (don't quote me on that, could be less off but still much cheaper than dinner) and it's definitely less busy.   Happy eating! I'm jealous!",

Your server cooks the meat for you too!!! Talk about personalized service. We ordered a family combo between two people and boy it was a lot of food!!! My favorite is the skirt steak. So yummy!!! Beware of the spicy short ribs. They weren't kidding about that. Usually when restaurants say \"spicy\" it's usually not spicy enough for me, but this one was no joke. Lol   I definitely recommend ordering the rice pop ice cream sandwich!!! It was so good!!! I wanted to order some to go but I knew it would melt by the time we got home. I will be definitely returning back again soon. :)",

The quality of meat was very good, and everything tasted great. I was surprised by how good the steamed egg and popcorn ice cream were. That said, there was not very much banchan (variety) compared to a more old-school place.  Service is probably the main detractor - it was fine when we first arrived, but as the place got busier, we waited longer and longer, and things became more and more overcooked (by default the servers will cook your meat for you). The table that arrived next to us later in the evening ordered but must've waited at least 30 min to get their first item. We waited around the same amount of time to just get the check.  I would definitely come here again but only aim for lower traffic times.",

The service is excellent. The fact that they are open till 2am is excellent. There was even one time, where our group had one person who couldn't eat beef, and one person who couldn't eat pork sharing a grill....and they were even willing to accommodate that!   Even though it's not AYCE, you're still going to be very full after this meal. Great side dishes, the bean paste stew and steamed egg are delicious. I think paying a little more for Hobak rather than the standard AYCE korean bbq place is worth it due to the quality, service, and experience you get.",

My boyfriend and I brought his father here for a first-time KBBQ experience. We got the Large Beef Combo. We ate every last damn bite of everything they brought out for us.  The meat was incredible. Very high quality beef, suuuuuuuuper lean - I hate going to KBBQ places only to find that half of the meat you grill is pure gristle!  Service was great. We did have to wait about 20 minutes for our table, but the servers were attentive, funny, and made our experience fun and comfortable.

Their service is less perfunctory and more like an experience, which lets be honest is really what a restaurant should be.  Maybe I just got lucky, but I was a waiter for years and I have never had such good service.  This alone would get them 5 stars       Yet it gets even better. Maybe this was just me, but do not be put off by looking at the menu online.  I internet trolled this restaurant before  going and thought \"this doesn't really look all that great or filling\" and I was unequivocally wrong.  For starters for the price, their meals are HUGE.  Like every other Korean Restaurant I have been to, it is like side dish explosion except this place the food just kept coming....and coming....and coming to the point where I had a concern that my bill was going to be like $100 for just be.  It wasn't that they just give you alot of food but their food is also creative and so Delicious.  Presentation.  Taste. Service.  All of it is spot on and puts every other restaurant in this price ranger to utter shame.   This is an amazing place, and frankly one of stronger Yelp recommendations I have given since I have used this service. Go here.  Eat.  Drink.  Have fun.  Bring friends.",

I really appreciated that my server attempted small talk, it shows he 's putting effort on his customer service.   This is a good place for a group of friends, or for someone celebrating their birthday. For the birthday celebrant, they play music overhead, the servers sing happy birthday and bring ice cream sandwiches with sparklers.   My husband and I got the beef and pork combo for two, and I felt that it was just enough to satiate our bellies. The seasoning of the meat was flavorful.   Lastly, details such as a toothbrush station in the bathroom and the ice cream sandwiches remind you that they are exerting effort to stand out and place a personal stamp on your dining experience.   Overall, I felt like even though it's a little more expensive than other restaurants, the customer service, flavoring and the atmosphere made it worth it. It has been awhile a restaurant had enough quirkiness to make me smile.   Pros: customer service, atmosphere, taste, ice cream sandwiches!  Cons: price",

    "text": "Overall a solid Korean BBQ place which I will visit it again but I have couple complains.  1. The line is always long and they don't do reservation which I can understand but they don't even let you call ahead to put your name on the waiting list. My house is about 20 mins from the restaurant and a week prior our first visit my wife and I tired to go there and we called and the wait was about an hour. We ended up went elsewhere but if they let us call in to put our name on the waiting list we probably would have gone.  2. Our servers were great for the most part expect one of them screwed up my pork belly. It was over cooked and it was dry. She turned the belly to early and the heat probably wasn't high enough in the first place. Now I got the negatives out of the way, here's what I like: Marinated skirt steak was very good, tender and juicy with great flavor.  Kimchi and the pan cake banchan were very good. The kimchi was not too strong but still has a nice flavor to it. But others banchan were just okay. One of the best things was the rice pop ice cream. It's not a culinary master piece but it was very fun to eat. Great texture contrast. It's like an ice cream sandwich with rice cake which was very crispy and then I  bit into it then I had the nice and creamy ice cream and then I felt some thing grainy which was the red bean paste(I think). All different kinds of texture in one bite. I like it a lot.  It's not the best high-end Korean BBQ but I found great value to take my kids and wife to there. But if just my wife and I for a date. I'll go to another Korean BBQ place which is my hands down favorite.",

For some reason, we had to always call the attention of any servers to check on our dipping sauce, rice etc. after eating, we waited for a long time for a server to offer our dessert since we have one of the combos. When the server showed up, we just had to go and ask for the check. This is very surprising tonight how the service was. It will take my boyfriend and I few months to come back and try again. We work in the hospitality service industry and at first this place definitely meet our expectations. Tonight is a different Hobak.",

The quality of the meat is good. I also love the banchan(sides), they have the sprouts with green onion or the sukjunamul-muchim. You get steamed eggs with the family combo, which we had. Also, you'll get beef stew. The kimchi is okay. The price is just right for what you get which is definitely worth it. I love the vibe all in all. I would 100% recommend it to others.",

Get here early or you'll be waiting out in the heat...though they do provide FREE lemon and cherry slushies :0) Even though there were customers clamoring to get in, we never felt pressured or hurried...shows they care about their customers\" experience over making a few extra dollars.  The only negatives would be that they need to up their banchan game and their egg dish was slightly overdone. As for the meats....extremely fresh and marinated really well....we had both marinated and not. We liked variety so we got the family set....1 large and 1 medium to accommodate 6 adults and 1 child.  We had the beef and pork combos.   Rice is complimentary but you have to request it.  If you are new to Korean BBQ, the waiters cook your meats for you by default unless you choose to do it yourself.   Come casual, don't wear your best because you'll come out smelling smoky.",

Had about 1/2 left of the short ribs to go with the sushi rice & Kim Chee and it was my snack the next morning flight back home. The servers was exceptional at cooking and explaining each dish. The rice pop mango dessert hit the spot.",

We had a party of 4 1/2 (10 yo doesn't eat much) and settled on the Beef/Pork combo and an order of brisket. Not an AYCE joint :(. My favorites were the aged Angus and skirt steak. I wasn't impressed with the banchan, not much choices. The servers were very attentive but I prefer to cook my own meat. The hubby kept picking up the tongs to turn the meat and our server would turn up out of nowhere and take over. Dessert comes with the combo, rice pop ice cream. We decided on green tea and plum wine. I recommend the plum wine. Sooo yummy. Overall it was a nice experience, cute setup and great service. I'll stick to AYCE Kbbq though.",

Definitely bringing more people here!",

While you wait, they serve slush for free so you can cool down from the summer heat. The interior looks great and unique compared to other kbbq's in town. You can definitely taste the quality difference with the meats compared to any ayce. It's a lot better! They also change the grill depending on the meat that is being served so most of them are tailored to cook specific meat. To top it all off, the service we received was great! Nari explained everything to us and made us feel welcome. She and Ryan served us really well!! I would definitely come here again. (:",

I would want to say no one go, so I'd have less of a wait to eat, but I can't do that. hahah  It is slightly pricey, but honestly it doesn't stop me from wanting to go again and again.",

The kalbi was very fatty (more fatty than normal) but the taste was great. The banchan was very skimpy though. One of the fun parts of Korean food is the plethora of banchan but not here. And they didn't refill any banchan (not even the kimchi)   All in all it was pretty good but don't think I would make a special trip out to Chinatown for this place. After living in NYC and houston, I've had \"to die for\" Korean BBQ (albeit for 3x more). So if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive group dinner and you happen to be in the area, this isn't a bad choice.",

    "text": "Pretty large restaurant with really great service. Servers here will cook your meat for you and change the grill without you asking.   We were a party of 7 and came at 5 to beat the dinner crowd and luckily we came early because around 6, a lot of people started to come and by 6:30 there was a long wait. Our table was set up for us before we sat down and we decided to order 2 family combos $84.99 each, good for about 3-4 people. I didn't think it would be enough for 7 people because I saw that it only comes with marinated skirt steak, aged short ribs, aged pork ribs and spicy pork belly. It also came with tofu soup and steamed egg.   I'm used to AYCE kbbq, and in LA there are a TON but the meat quality and service isn't as good as Hobak. I didn't like how they only gave you 1 bean paste stew and 1 steamed egg per order. It was enough for the 7 of us though but we also ordered a kimchee stew and corn cheese. Also, they don't have rice paper or radish paper here. Side dishes were ok, kimchee was good, not super fermented/sour which is how I like it.   5/5 for the marinated skirt steak. It wasn't too fatty and literally melted in my mouth.  3/5 for the short ribs and pork ribs.  1/5 for the spicy pork belly. I think only one person at the table thought it was decent. Everyone else didn't care much for it. We took the portions to go.   Next time, I think I'll stick to the BEEF combo. Everything was so well marinated that we didn't need to dip our meat into the brisket sauce that they offered. They also have a sea salt and sesame oil mix as well. After the meal, we were asked what kind of ice cream we wanted and we were given the options of: mango, plum, green tea, vanilla and something else. We got green tea and plum. I guess its a rice ice cream sandwich sort of thing. My friends didn't like the outside so they just ate the ice cream inside.   I liked how they have air vents that moved up and down directly over the grill so smoke doesn't go everywhere. In the bathroom there are toothbrushes, cups and mouthwash for you to use after your meal.   Everyone was STUFFED by the time we finished eating. The bill came out to be about $222 before tip for the 2 family combos, corn cheese ($3.99), kimchee stew ($7.99), 6 sodas, and 1 sake which isn't bad!",

We ordered from the combo menu that was around $60 for two people, which isn't too bad. We ordered the Family Combo #1, which is designed for 2 and included: brisket, pork belly, pork rib, and spicy boneless shortrib. We had the steamed egg, which was tasteless and the stew that was pretty good. I had to order my cheese corn because that's my favorite at any kbbq, but the corn was a little overly cooked because they were dry. However, the taste was still there. We left too full to finish the pork belly, but the briskets were my dealbreaker. They were too big of a slice and not cut thin enough so it was chewy. The ice cream they served at the end was also very unique because it was a thin crispy texture with ice cream in the middle - rice pop ice cream. They accidentally brought us two, so we got one on the house. Very far from the strip and a bit hard to find by rideshare.",

But it actually did. The bean paste soup was the bomb and all the side dishes. The servers were super nice, loved the kpop music in the background and everything was like the set up at Korean restaurants in Seoul. However the waiting area is very small inside. It was 110 degrees outside and the waiting area outside was full too. The quality of meat was EXCELLENT!!! Will definitely be visiting Hobak again soon.",

    "text": "Hobak Korean BBQ is by far the best Korean BBQ I've ever had, and this is a lot considering I am 100% Korean and have had my fair share of Korean BBQ.   It's one of the newer BBQ joints and completely outshines tofu hut, Goong etc. The meat itself is extremely tender and they butcher their own meat where you can come and purchase yourself.   When we come here we also get the marinated beef and spicy marinated beef. The banchan (Korean word for appetizers) are always fresh and endless.   The service here is impeccable with the employees constantly rotating so you don't have to worry about flagging down your server since all of them help. They also have a service button at each table should you need something. In addition they all wear radios so they are constantly in communication.   You can tell this isn't like any other Korean BBQ they cater to both the Korean culture and American one. Another positive to hobak is they also cook your food for you! Most places bring you the food and make you cook yourself.   To add they have complimentary popcorn and beverages for when you are waiting for your table to be ready.",

It was so flavorful, the marinated ones were marinated to perfection - as was the way they cooked them.

    "text": "Hubby and I cruised into town early afternoon last Friday and decided to give Hobak a go.  A quick call revealed that there was no wait.  What!  Cool!  The place is pretty neato looking....exposed ceiling, concrete floors and those cool pull-down exhausts.  Although there's no wait, it did take a few minutes to get seated because they prefer to set up the table with banchan and water before the seat the guest.  We were starvin' Marvin so we got the small beef combo. I went to restroom while hubby ordered and the server asked if we were very hungry, hubby said always so we were recommended the ribeye and marinated short rib.  I know some Yelpers really recommended the skirt steak but oh well!  Food came...brisket and rib-eye were amaaaazing.  The short rib was incredibly tender (\"How is this beef?\"), likely because it had been aged and tenderized by the marinade. Hubby and I didn't much care for the marinade but it was still delicious beef.  Other cool stuff: - Bean sprout banchan  - Pancake - Disposable toothbrushes in restrooms - Delicious bibimbap lunch box, shaken tableside like at Kang Ho Dong Baekjong - Most amazing yet simple dessert of green tea ice cream with red bean paste and peanut powder on rice crackers. - Service was great.  There was a slight communication error simply because they were eager to serve.  We told one guy to hold off cooking our meat for 10 minutes but right after he left, a lady came by and started throwing the meat on the grill.  Other notes:  Rice is not included in the meal but THEY DO NOT CHARGE FOR IT.  They just don't automatically give it to you but it is cheerfully offered.  Final note:  If you have a large appetite, the small meal was juuuuuuust right.  Hubby and I felt like if we hadn't each had a bowl of rice as well as the extra bibimbap lunchbox, we probably could have had another meal afterwards.  For those with smaller appetites, I would say, this may feed 2.5 people.  Check it out!",

I'm obsessed with KBBQ, and while I was initially skeptical that it could be THAT good, this has got to be the best KBBQ I've ever had. I had Hobak for dinner last night, but I'm dreaming about it today still.  1. Everyone else knows the hype is real. Line is long at peak hours. 2. Pick your combo. The short rib (kalbi) and skirt steak are AMAZING! Everything melts in your mouth!  3. Your server cooks it for you to perfection. Our guy, James, was incredible. Genuine vibes, so nice, and funny. He's rocking a sweet K-Pop frosted hairdo, so you can't miss him.   Even though it's not AYCE, we went home with hardcore leftovers after eating and eating and eating. I like how they cook each meat individually and wait for you to finish a round before continuing; normally not a fan of people cooking it for me since they dump it ALL on the grill at once, and it gets cold before I can eat it.  The quality is the food is so good.  Banchan unlimited, of course.   The staff here will truly make a good experience great. Since table turnover is a lot less (you'll end up spending two hours here), I'd recommend hooking your staff up with a killer gratuity if they did good by you. My first trip to Hobak was 5 star service that deserves 5 star appreciation!",

Lost track of time xD   We were sat in the front corner but middle tables.   Service was great as usual. We had got the Family Combo this time around because friend wanted some pork.   Hobak Family Combo ($51.99 for Small, $84.99 for Large) - Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak, Hobak Aged Short Ribs, Angus Boneless Short Ribs, Grilled Spicy Pork Belly, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, and Rice Pop Ice Cream  We had also ordered a Peach Soju to drink for fun :) It tasted pretty good. One of the better flavored soju's i've had so far (including the red and blue ive had in Seoul in April, 2016). I still Q_Q at the price difference though... Lol   We were notified before things were coming out that they had ran out of the Angus Boneless Short Ribs which now i realized was a little contradictory because they gave me the option of Aged Short Rib not being available and able to get the boneless short rib or rib eye at an additional cost of $4 or brisket or angus short rib. But i still ordered the angus boneless short rib. Now im confused at the time of writing this review ?!?? LOL   WELL no matter. English barrier i guess.   I had been told by a coworker that the bean paste stew and steamed egg were unlimited refillable but being 2 people, we were quite stuffed and satisfied with just our order.   All the meats were amazing. The marinated skirt steak was amazingly flavored. Nice and light. Not too sweet or savory like most american KBBQ places. Reminded me of Seoul, Korea.   According to my friend, the grilled spicy pork belly was a bit spicy for her to handle. Yet she was able to eat the green onion salad. So those who don't eat much spiciness, be aware.   Short ribs both beef and pork were amazingly tender and well cooked.   Quite the amount of food for 2 people. We both food coma'ed after we went home.   I love the fact i dont have to cook... AT ALL ! at this place. Makes me lazy but i can focus on talking to friend(s).   Still my highly recommended place for people to try out.",

I just put food in my mouth and look at the Korean movie posters decorating the walls and watching their TV ads repeatedly on the 2 TVs  The meat is high quality and deliciously marinated. The family meals are not a bad deal. I think with tax and tip, it ended up being $35/person and we were STUFFED at the end, not bad compared to what I could look up about AYCE KBBQ in the area. The staff is always there and making sure you have all the banchan and water that you could ever want. The rice pop ice cream dessert concoction is incredible and I wish I could get that as a standalone dessert somewhere :(. It's a rice cracker (think maybe those like shrimp crackers without the shrimpy flavor) with strawberry syrup/red bean paste, and ice cream bundled up in an ice cream sandwich-like dessert. Both green tea and vanilla were tasty but I think vanilla won in the end. Also 10% off if you go in for lunch and the place was empty!",

    "text": "Hobak Korean BBQ's rise in popularity in such a short timespan is well deserved.  I brought my family here during Hobak's opening weekend last month and we were not disappointed.   From the amicable and helpful staff, the retro-polished look of the restaurant, and the delicious assortment of BBQ, I would highly recommend this place.     Upon arrival, the wait for a table was minuscule and we were offered one of two slushie type drinks while we waited.  This place is not an all-you-can-eat spot but you get a hefty portion of meat for the price you do pay.   Different combinations on the menu and various pricing will land your table meats which may include beef, pork, chicken, etc.   We did the mixed beef and pork option for two people and it was a carnivore's dream.  The accompanying side dishes were fairly good.  The kimchee was delicious as was the steamed egg.  We did have to ask for rice (which ended up being free of charge) as it was not initially served to us.    The servers cook all your food right at your table in an encircled grill.  This was reminiscent to the NYC Korean BBQ spots I've tried though I do miss being able to cook the meat ourselves.  Like in NYC, I did see Yukhoe (seasoned raw beef with raw egg) offered and I'll have to order it next time to compare!  As far as I know, it's the only Korean place I know that serves this.  Dessert was included in the food option we chose which was ice cream sandwiched between rice popcorn-type rice cakes. It was great.  One more \"above and beyond\" service provided can be found in their bathrooms.  Mouthwash, packaged toothbrush and toothpaste, and mints can be found for those fighting the war on bad breath and cavities.    Overall, Hobak is a great and welcome addition to the sea of Korean bbq spots opening all over the Vegas valley.  Unlike many others, though, Hobak is making a convincing argument of who really is the best Korean bbq spot in town.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 25/100",

    "text": "Very well-deserved 5 stars!  Came here on a weekday early afternoon to see that a good handful of the tables filled. But that didn't stop the amazing service at this place! Once you walk in, a hostess will take your party size and offer you free slushie while you wait for your table to be ready.  We went with the Small Hobak Family Combo. You get a good amount of meat per plate as the servers bring and prepare one after another. Keep in mind that the servers will pretty much do all of the cooking so all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the food! If you try to even touch the tongs, you'll see that the they'll use their walkie talkies to alert one another followed by someone coming quickly to your table to offer assistance! (Shout-out to our gr8 servers Cody and Ryan!)  Hobak serves different banchans compared to other KBBQ places! Their bean sprout salad definitely takes the cake. It had a slight kick and it was so tasty on its own or with the meat. Meat-wise, the skirt steak was probably my favorite. Go try it for yourself and you'll see why (': But my favorite was definitely the dessert! It was a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two Korean rice pop cake with red bean paste and strawberry jam. Never had anything like it before and I was SO amazed.  Just an FYI, this is not an AYCE place. But what you don't get in quantity, you get in quality. Plus, we were pretty much filled with all the other items included in each combo!  Definitely will see us soon!",

    "text": "Being a Korean in Las Vegas we all know that when it comes to korean bbq recommendations we all say ,\" it sucks here! just go to Los Angeles!\" BUT FINALLY a place I can tell my friends to go to.  Setting: The interior is basically that of 1980's Korea with the classic high school camo uniform you'll see the servers wearing. The decor reminds me of how soyo's is set up but less post war appearing haha. The restaurant is nicely spaced out with non bbq options available but really you came here for one thing and that's to bbq! The bathrooms are nice and stocked with disposable toothbrushes, and toothpaste to get rid of that post bbq dank breath. Each bbq table has an retractable vent that ventilates the smoke very well but I'd leave that up to the servers to adjust.  Food: You can order the meats individually but I highly recommend ordering the set. Me and my friend opted for the beef set which made us beyond full $51 i believe. The black angus was nicely tender with good amount of marbling to give it that buttery consistency. The side dishes which i typically ignore, I couldn't at this place. Kimchi was really authentic with thick sauce that coats each leaf of radish. Water kimchi was perfectly sour and refreshing when sipping on. The brisket isn't the best but still better than most places in Las Vegas. Here they offer a cup of melted cheese to dip the brisket in which I found great.  The ribeye and the marinated beef ribs were on point! I wish I could've had more room to finish it.  Dessert: Is a korean rice cracker with red bean spread and a thick helping of vanilla or green tea ice cream all put together to create this delicious ice cream sandwich. I recommend going with the green tea.  Service: Never have I been to a Korean bbq place where the servers YES the servers can grill all the meat and cut it for you too! Usually it's my job to do that but very convenient to sit back and have them to all the work for me  Overall: The overall 5 star rating is justified and Hobak is THE korean bbq place in Las Vegas. Come on a weekday and call ahead, this place will get packed!",

This meat is also very tender and the restaurant has a very playful environment. However, it can get a bit loud sometimes, so if you want to have a close convo with someone, I recommend sitting VERY close to them. I would recommend their marinated beef. Hope this helps!",

The newbie on the block, Hobak made it on my list for stupendous quality of meat and service!  - FREE slushies while you wait for your table - You walk towards your table and the entire staff     welcomes you - Table is ready with side dishes, water, and all     the fixins - Affordable prices, simple menu and three      different combos to choose from - Charcoal and gas grill combo are used - Server does the grilling and the meat cutting - Grill is changed often - Quality and flavor of meats are superb!   (Highlight: skirt steak and spicy pork belly 2          thumbs up) - Oral hygiene supplies are complimentary in     restroom areas  On a little side note.. I felt the round table was cramped for a party of four with all the dishes on the table. Although the banchan they offered were not all that bad, I prefer other options. The server does all the grilling and the cutting, but would rather do the work myself. To pull all things together, Hobak gave me a lasting impression that has persuaded me to come back for more! Hobak Korean BBQ newbie!                       You've earned my 5 stars!",

Restaurant was clean and at each table, there was this vent that was above each stove. I thought that was cool since I don't really see that at most BBQ places. Service was wonderful and I never felt that we had to flag down someone before our meat caught on fire.  The side dishes were seasoned well and addicting. I had to pace myself because I knew I was going to get full before the actual meat came out. For BBQ, we chose the family combo #1 which came out with 3 meats. The way they cooked our meat was one meat at a time. By the time the 3rd meat was cooking, I was getting full. But the meat was so tender and flavourful that I had to eat it all. It was sooo worth it in the end despite the stomach pain later.   And if you think you can't make room for dessert, well you better. They give out complementary ice cream sandwich which was also good. The sandwich part was crunchy, cripsy, and addicting. Come check out this place if you are in the area!",

My girlfriend and I saw that Hobak received a 5 star review overall. I was excited and we went. I was instantly transported back to Seoul! Very warm, attentive staff. The interior was very well thought out, and appropriate. Restrooms were a trip, lol. And very clean! The meal... We got the family dinner combo for 2. If you like Korean you will be super impressed!! Not only the best Korean meal, but one of my top 10 ever!!! We left very full and happy. Do not, I repeat... DO NOT MISS OUT ON DESSERT!! The green tea ice cream sandwich thing was probably the most complimenting and delicious desserts I have ever had. This place is now one of our go to spots! Thank you Hobak, see you real soon!!!",

We didn't care too much for the spicy pork belly, felt it was too fatty. The meat is cooked for you, which is great! The service is amazing, they are great at refilling your side dishes and refilling waters. I just wish they had radish as an option. The combo meal ends with a green tea ice cream (or vanilla) sandwhich with rice paper and was just perfect. The ambience of the restaurant is very modern. The tables even have call buttons to request service, your check, etc so you are never left waiting. Definitely give it a try!",

Everything else had no taste and was very plain. We ordered a side of brisket but it was mostly fat, again no taste. Service was all over the place.

We ordered the family combination and it was very good.  The side dishes that came with the meats were also very good.  It was nice that we didn't have to cook the meats ourselves.  The other good thing is that we didn't smell like barbecue, which happens in Korean restaurants with grills in the table.  The service was quick and the waiters were helpful.  Overall, we had a very good experience and would highly recommend Hobak to our friends.",

    "text": "Came in around 2pm on a Sunday with a party of 4 and was seated right away. This was our first time having Korean BBQ in Las Vegas and at a non-all you can eat restaurant at that. I will admit I was a bit skeptical, but ended up being floored by the quality of the food and service. We decided to go with the large Hobak beef combo and I was worried about the party still being hungry, but it turned out to be the perfect amount of food. They first brought out the many side dishes and took a bit of time before the meat was brought out. A server then proceeded to cook one of the meats at the table and left until everyone had a chance to finish it before proceeding to cook the next meat selections. The quality of the meat was amazing, especially the brisket. To top it off, once you're done with the meal, ice cream sandwiches came with the combo! We ordered the green tea and strawberry and they were cut in quarters. The \"sandwich\" portion was a crispy rice wafer that was the icing on the cake, or meal in this case.   And it gets even better. Once we were done eating, I stopped by the bathroom to see it was stocked with toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouth rinse for your use. They've seriously thought of everything!   This has easily became one of my favorite restaurants ever and will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas.",

I swear its like the pork belly, the angus steak, the skirt steak and the pork fat just melts in your mouth. The steamed egg is too die for, everything about this place is good. The service is great, our servers name is Nana, she cooked our food and she had fast paced and professional service. Honestly it gets busy here but its worth the wait. The best korean BBQ in town.

If you want good meat and good service, come here.  Location/ambiance: this place is pretty far off the strip (3miles?). But well worth the trip. It's set up like Kang Hodong baekjang (for those of you familiar to SoCal). Very clean and well lit. Individual fans and girls per table. Prepare to wait. Lines were still there at 10:30pm on Saturday night. Great for a group of people looking to hangout.  Service: similar to what you would find in LA or OC. Servers all over the place. You can grab any of them and place an order. It was busy so service was a tad slow. They would put your meat order and the meat was individual prepared by a butcher in the kitchen. Spoke mostly Korean but all also understands English.  Food: thy brag that the meat is \"angus prime\". The meat quality was good indeed. I came late to the party so only got to try the chadol (brisket) and Galbi. Both were wonderful. The side dishes were a plenty. I didn't get to try the mandatory salad so can't comment on that. The \"lunchbox\" was also good and a must order. I like their complimentary slushy machine in the corner.  I would definitely return. We hung out here til close to midnight.",

I really enjoy the salad, I think it was nice that it's unlimited refills as well they cook the meat for you. I am giving them a five star, but I think it will be best if one server per table, as well it will give a chance to know them at better personal level.  This way I would give a better tip. My first server we really liked her and I believe she should get 25% tip but the last othet server took my tip for servers down to 20% over the food was great and har a good time",

The atmosphere is great and the beef is delicious with savory flavors especially their sauce. However, we did have a server, Dennis with a attitude. Dennis hardly talked to us without a smile and that was fine until she cooked our beef with high fire that it was almost burnt. When my table and I told her to stop, she threw her hands in the air and said \"whatever\" then never came back and had a change of severs. Every other sever was genuinely nice and caring towards us. The customer is always right, we didn't need the attitude when Dennis simply could've said \"okay\" and lowered the fire. It all could've been avoided but, my family and I won't be coming back no matter how good the food was. Terrible service creates a terrible mood for dinner. Do not request to have Dennis serve you unless if you want your meal severed with a bad attitude.",

This is by far the best quality meats you will get. This is not the frozen crap all the other places serve.  We (two of us) ordered the small combo ... $52. By far it was more food than two people should ever eat ... but it was so good, I'm gonna keep eating!  Then they bring you included desert ... Unnmmmm, this is my new favorite place in Vegas!",

However, over time I've experimented with other KBBQ places other than AYCE and OHHHH MAN, I've been TOTALLY MISSING OUT!! To me, its all about the quality of meat and hobak definitely does not lack quality at all! I always like to get their beef combo, which you have a choice of different premium cut meats. Not only is their meat so good, but the atmosphere feels different from your typical korean bbq spot... maybe thats how it is in Korea? I've never been but its pretty cool! I love their side dishes and BEST, I love their rice cracker dessert!  Price is reasonable! I mean here, you spend approximately on average $25-$30 on an AYCE KBBQ spot. Their small beef combo is $59.99 and that feeds 2. So realistically you're paying for about the same as if you would an AYCE spot which is great!  Oh, and service is always top knotch!",

The combo also comes with the bean soup and it was so good. To top it off, it also came with an ice cream sandwich dessert. Oh yes!!! It was amazing. I also had to order some yogurt soju cocktail and it was quite tasty. I made a pig out of myself and I'm not even mad. I'm glad I was able to bring my wife to her first True Korean BBQ experience. She loved it. Hobak will definitely be getting more of my business the next time I'm in town. They say money doesn't buy happiness but Hobak proves them wrong. To top off the whole experience, if you've ever eaten Korean food you'd understand, they have toothbrushes, toothpaste, & mouthwash in the bathrooms for after your meal. Well done!  Our server Eric was the most amazing server and made the experience even more enjoyable with his helpfulness and suggestions.",

We start off we had the the family combo #3 absolutely amazing! Skirt steak was amazing juicy and tender not chewy; next was the short ribs they were not my favorite but still delicious! #3 the spicy beef definitely had a nice kick to it but nothing that made me want to stop eating it! And lastly when we thought we were all done and were near full came the spicy pork belly which perhaps due to being nearly full was just not happening for me, however after a short break of delicious food I tried it again and it was great! I cooked this a little longer for it to crisp and that was perfect!  To end our meal our combo comes with a delicious ice cream sandwich we went for the green tea flavor and it was so good we we decided to write this review to get another complimentary sandwich after verified with a server! It's really that awesome!  Overall absolutely recommend this place, quality over quantity and will be returning for more!!!",

    "text": "I wasn't a fan of these type of Korean BBQ places after my experience with Goong, but this place changed it all for me! When I say \"these type\" of places I mean the non ayce kine. I'm a big eater and I really want to get my money's worth, so the reason why goong ruined it for me was the lack of portion and overhyped quality. I can honestly say I got my money's worth over here and left with a full belly!   Hobak is located on spring mt and jones which is right before the busy part of spring mt, so you won't deal with much traffic or STOOOOOPID drivers. That's always a plus! When I first walked in I was pleased by the layout of this restaurant as it is open and clean! I feel like it's well ventilated and you won't walk out smelling like you been grilling all day.  My girlfriend and I were seated immediately. I assume it gets very busy during dinner hours, but we came around 1 and it wasn't so bad. We got the beef combo for two people and it was priced at 57.99. We got A LOT of food! They give a lot of banchan (side dishes) along with your meal. They also cook your food for you also!!You also get one order of steamed egg and soybean paste stew which was amazing. The briskets were my favorite... super chewy and full of flavor. Next we got the short ribs cooked medium rare which we loved! It was tender and our server cooked it perfectly. The skirt steak was my favorite! It was tender and cooked medium rare (I would suggest you get it like that), but what really made me enjoy it was the taste! It was juicy and with every bite you would want more. For dessert we got the dessert which was ice cream surrounded by some type of rice cake with red bean I believe. My girlfriend didn't wanna finish it because she wished she could save it for later. It was that good haha. Overall I had an awesome experience and 3 hours later writing this review.. I'm still full. Time to hit the gym!",

The ice cream sandwiches was awesome too. I've been to many different types of Korean BBQ, but this place to me is ranked the best too date.

    "text": "Ok first the positives: funky weird atmosphere; looks kinda like nostalgic hollywood meets koreatown-ish. Interesting little touches like mouthwash n toothpaste in women's bathroom, water misters out front, and yummy complimentary ice slush drinks while u wait to be seated. Also, unlike other Korean BBQ restaurants, the servers do most of the meat cooking for you in front of you. One other cool unique thing was the way they serve the dessert that is included with any of the large meal packages.  You choose your flavors of ice cream and they come in kind of a crispy wafer sandwich. Very interesting and very yummy. Now here are the negatives compared to other Korean BBQ places in town: since the servers cook your meat, it seems you have to wait longer for them to finish one meat and then come back and start the next one, whereas at a self serve all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place you would be able to  choose which meats you wanted to put on the grill at which time so that you're not finished with one course, then waiting 10 minutes with no entree, then  waiting 10 minutes again for the next while you're hungry n doing nothing. The  side dishes come in mostly large bowls which take up way too much space, they are not particularly tasty and most are spicy which is not good if the person eating them doesnt like spicy food. Because of the cost you end up with less meat then you could get at an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant that may be more homey, but the meat there tastes just as good if not better. Also I prefer smaller side dishes that can be replaced when we run out instead of ones that take up too much space on the table and then you don't know if you're allowed to get a refill if you finish them. It seemed like the bussers were understaffed because tables near us took forever to get cleaned up after guests left and they almost never took away our dishes when we were done, which cluttered our small table. Also they have this odd gimmick called cheese fondue which is basically a small bowl of cheese that they let melt in front of you on your grill and you're supposed to dip your meat into it. However I did not feel that it added anything at all to the Korean flavors of the meat. It was just kind of strange. Also it was strange that for the four of us to get the bowls of white rice that came with our package, we had to ask three times before we received them. The service was just ok so considering all the factors, im glad i tried it, but I won't be going back.",

Because they set up the tables with the condiments before seating. Just like a typical Korean bbq, they serve kimchee, radish, assorted veggies and 1 bowl of rice.   I honestly think that the waiters and waitresses should pay more attention to the tables only because we had to constantly ask for something. The meat was really tender and spiced just right.  I would def come back again!",

They did not forget about us (unlike other restaurants where they're too much or the lack thereof with their presence) but these servers were on POINT! Aside from the excellent service, oh my goodness, this is probably the best KBBQ here in Vegas. My fiance and I are habitual KBBQ eaters, there's some decent ones in Vegas but Hobak hit the right spot .  We ordered the Set #3 which was enough for the two of us, not too much meat and not too little either. We were served with 4 different kinds of meat but I think the brisket was the best one out of them all (which explains why they saved the best for last )  Towards the end of our meal, they informed us that our meal came with an ice cream dessert. It was Korean rice crackers with ice cream in between - so basically a Korean ice cream sandwich. It was alright, could've gone without it but since it was included, then why not, right? We're definitely coming back again and we'll bring some friends along, too! Shoutout to our main server, didn't get his name but he was the real MVP.",

They put down a huge variety of side dishes you can have all you like. But for the meats, you get small portions of low quality.   They do the cooking? They quickly pushed the meat around the grill, announced it was done and retreated. We had to take over, because we felt it was hardly done.   Also they have an exhaust fan they keep lowering and raising over the food. Found that very annoying.   So by eating all the side dishes, we had enough to eat, but it was all not very good, and you will have a worse taste in your mouth when you get the huge bill!  There are much better and cheaper Korean BBQ's around town. I suggest visiting those!",

It makes me a little sad that I've had the best KBBQ I've ever had and I live several states away from it. I've been to a ton of these restaurants and none could come close to this one. The meat selections were so good and tender and flavorful. The servers keep an eye on the cooking process for you and ours were very attentive. To end the meal you get an ice cream sandwich and it changed my life. All this to say that you will not be disappointed in dining here, just when you leave and realize that no other KBBQ will ever compare.",

It's tucked in China/Japan/Korean town and the neighborhood has that feel of friendly congestion of cars and people that makes one feel a bit safer with all the activity. The staff are truly helpful, friendly and ready to answer questions. The craziest thing about this place is the wait time. 2 hours! They let you know well in advance and there are people who wait there. If you're there with friends and are socially capable, and not a phone junkie, it can add up to an interesting meal. For those not capable of sitting in a single location for that long, one can drive to TJ Maxx or a supermarket for an hour and a half. They really are timely in their estimate. The food is really tasty and I'm still a bit old fashioned so my date and I were surprised they literally cook, cut and serve you for each dish! Good quality ingredients and marinated nicely. The orders tend to be large for a group of two or three! But then Vegas is all about excess! Loved the short ribs! And had spicy fried rice with Kim chee. Yum! We will be back!

    "text": "This is a Korean BBQ place that I'd recommend everyone to try out! Korean BBQ doesn't always have to be associated with AYCE. Instead it serves higher quality meat and amazing service. No wonder Andrew Zimmerman (from the Travel Channel) even made a visit to Hobak just recently. That's when you know you know this place is really something.  Apparently from all the other reviews, there's a long wait time. I was lucky enough to only wait 10 minutes on a Sunday night. Right when you walk in, there's a complimentary slushie machine by the door to sip on while you wait. You can always come back to the machine for refills even after you been seated.  The side dishes all look delicious! I especially love their potato pancakes. You are welcome to ask for more if you run out. They didn't hand it out to me unless I asked, but there's also salad and a bowl of rice. The salad had an interesting dressing in it which I really like!  My family of 3 ended up ordering the large beef combo which included three types of meat. We got the short rib, rib eye, and brisket. It was delicious!!! You can definitely taste the high quality in each bite. Unlike most Korean BBQs, this one has amazing service. The waiters are constantly checking up on you and cooking all the meat. They actually don't let you cook it yourself. At the end of the meal, there was also ice cream included! There was a good amount of flavors to choose from and it comes in a rice cracker-like sandwich.  Not only is the service and food amazing, but so is the bathroom! There's complimentary toothbrush, mouth wash, and toothpaste for your dental needs. Unfortunately it's only one bathroom per gender so it would be a long wait if someone was taking their sweet time. Apparently on the wall next to the outside of the bathrooms, they claim to have other services such as free wifi and chargers.  This was definitely one of my favorite place for Korean BBQ. A must try for all locals and tourist!",

The kalbi blew me away tho! Super juicy, probably due to their wet aging, and an extremely tasty marinade. Slightly more expensive than a typical Korean place but well worth the money.

The meat is cooked over charcoal by the servers at the tabletop and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy!  Service was great and they were quick to provide refills of the sides when requested.  I liked the steamed eggs so much that I asked if I could have another one.  They did and it was complimentary!

A bit overpriced for what it's worth. The service is very friendly, but needs some improvements. It seems like the servers spent most of their efforts and time on cooking the meats for the tables, and shorten the level of service in other areas. It took about 20 minutes for them to finally come take our order and same for the table next to us. Paying for our bill was a bit challenging too, when we received our check, we immediately put our credit card on the table and it took them about 15 minutes to finally come by and pick up the payment.",

This place uses real charcoal for those who liked the stronger smoked flavor but surprisingly the ventilation system works very well.   The short ribs was our favorite and we totally enjoyed the hip setting.  The dish portion is of good size and no one will leave with an empty stomach.  It could get busy and noisy fast and so get there early to avoid the crowd.",

Heck, it's not even ayce, but with that being said, my experience here was phenomenal and I'd like to give a huge shout out to Randy for taking such good care of us. At first I was a little surprised that such a new restaurant had 5 stars, with plenty of reviews to back it up, but after dining here, I could definitely see why.  My boyfriend and I had the beef combo for two. It came with brisket, your choice of beef, steamed egg, and some sort of soup. With Randy's suggestion, we chose the rib eye and skirt steak. Like I said earlier, it's not your typical kbbq so they cook your food for you, in front of you, ( which always makes everything taste better because you don't work as hard haha) and not only that, but the quality of each meat was amazing. He started with the brisket, which had very little fat (a very good thing). He brought out sushi rice and wrapped the brisket around each cube of sushi rice and dipped it in their hobak vinegar-y sauce. DELICIOUS. I didn't even touch my sesame oil and salt.  Then he changed the grill and started to cook the rib eye and skirt steak both medium rare. Another lady took over, Annabelle, and she even asked if we wanted the the fat cut off the steak. She cooked both steaks to a perfect temperature. I ended up dipping the skirt steak in the vinegar sauce as well and it really added to the flavor. And they also put taro and sweet potato on the grill also, which we liked to dip in the cheese fondue they had. The tapas were really good. I liked the bean sprouts and salad a lot. Just everything was perfect from our server Randy as well as the west of the staff to the dessert(ice cream inside a rice cracker taco... YUM) I could not rave more about this place...  I enjoyed every minute of it.  The saying \"quality over quantity\" definitely goes with this restaurant, and not only did I get full, but my taste buds were truly satisfied..   I recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",

    "text": "A few of my friends out here in Las Vegas decided to have a night out at Hobak Korean BBQ. Since one of my friends is living a True keto lifestyle, I figure it would be appropriate to support that diet. First thing I noticed when we got there was a febreze station to spray yourself with when you left the restaurant... odd if you've never had kbbq, but so relevant if you've had had it before. I will say right off the bat, the proteins are  NOT all you can eat (AYCE), but the bon chon (side dishes) are. Still a nice little spot with a spacious main dining area and an attentive wait staff... I  think it was worth the price.  We got the large family combo to split between 5 that came with Angus brisket, premium pork belly, aged pork rub, and spicy Angus boneless short rib (see photos). The portions were just right and the sides definitely left us all feeling full. Of all the proteins, the premium pork belly stood out the most. The way they lacerated the meat had the pork belly cook evenly and fast! And yes, they do cook for you so you can focus on eating! Always a plus at premium kbbqs. The spicy short rib was served last and it did have a nice kick to it, you have been forewarned.  To top it off, tempura ice cream was served as part of the combo and you get to pick your own two out of 5 flavors. Twas a nice finish at the end of the meal.  I definitely recommend this place as a spot to hit up because of the great service, the amazing food, and the social atmosphere.  These guys thought about every little detail including the free toothbrushes in the bathroom while playing \"Learn Korean\" saying overhead. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone!",

Hobak is not all you can eat, but when you split about 3 or so meat dishes among your friends with all the extras they provide, it honestly winds up being cheaper and the food you get is much better quality. Attendants also drop by to cook your food to perfection, and all the while you feel like you really get to know them and they are a positive addition to the KBBQ experience.   Finally, with regards to the food: the beef is fresh  and delicious and so are the sides. My favorite one had to be the spicy marinated dish, but I love spicy food. There is enough variety to please everyone! Also, as weird as it sounds, Hobak has some of the best water I've ever had. Sounds weird, but their filter must be amazing because the water tastes so crisp and good, and you need a lot of it to wash down the food!",

It was super busy & we had a 40 minute wait, but we walked 2 doors down to the adorable coffee shop. It's a great place to check out while you wait for your table! If you're waiting inside or outside, there's a cute little popcorn machine to tide you over if you need a little snack!  Once you get called in you'll notice 2 things:  1) the decor is adorable! (it's like you're in a cute little restaurant in South Korea)  2) it's not AYCE or cheap!  Hobak is for people who appreciate and don't mind paying a little extra for PREMIUM meat! We ordered one of the combos & loved everything! The meats were all just so tender & juicy~ you taste the difference right away. We weren't expecting quality beef like this & were shocked at how good it was. Our non-Korean friends who we brought here agreed that the meat was amazing!  Plenty of banchans & different soju options from basic to fruity to the fancier expensive Hwaro! Don't forget to order corn cheese if you've never had it before~ SO, so good with BBQ!  Our server was super attentive, friendly, & cooked our meat for us (another plus that I LOVE!)!!! We were there for a while with friends & never felt rushed or lacked anything. A few other servers who helped us were just as friendly as our waitress & went out of their way to make sure we got everything we needed right away!  Dinner at Hobak was just a phenomenal meal! Everything from food to service to atmosphere were all 5-star for a casual dining experience! Will DEFINITELY be back whenever we're in Vegas!",

The meet had a horrible propane gas taste and the meal was waaay over priced for what you get!! The sides were not good at all. The service however was excellent and friendly... There are no knives to trim all the fat either... Save your money and hit Tbones or a solid Steak house!!!",

    "text": "Was in town for the weekend and wanted to try this place since my husband tried it recently and liked the food. It's a fun, festive environment and will have a wait time on the weekends. The inside has a small waiting area (read: one bench) but there are several heat lamps outside if you want to chill outside.  We waited about 30 minutes and were called in. A few banchan plates were already present (kimchi, cold soup w/ noodles, cucumbers). We ordered the combo BBQ beef w/ skirt steak, brisket and another beef cut (don't remember). For the price we paid, the quantity of beef seemed on the paltry side and the quality was meh. I've had much better beef at KBBQ places in Garden Grove. Also, there wasn't a ton of variety in the banchan (no japchae, glass noodles, etc). The soybean tofu soup was average and super salty. The best item was the steamed egg and it was on point. The fried rice was too sweet and kind of greasy.  Overall, I thought it was very average and would not likely come back.",

    "text": "There are obviously a lot of great things going on for Hobak including attentive servers that diligently supervise your meat, grills that burn charcoal with sufficient ventilation, late hours for those wanting to avoid the rushes or are hungry for late night grub, and combos that include bean paste stew, sushi rice, steamed egg, and rice pop ice cream.  Meat always tops the priority list for me and Korean barbecue, and what sets Hobak head and shoulders above every other place is the quality of their meats. The beef is Black Angus that's been wet aged for 21 days. And the pork only comes from the Heritage breeds. They always slice the best cuts that when cooked appropriately by your servers, results in proteins that taste clean, are juicy, and melt in your mouth. I've been staying away from the marinated meats lately just so I can enjoy the superior flavors of this beef and pork alone. I can't get enough of the pork belly when I come. It's not a slice of bacon sized cut. It's thick, includes those savory layers of fat, and is topped with a sprig of rosemary while cooking. I'm confident Hobak will pass any taste test you want to put up against them.  The combos are the best way to get bang for your buck with choices of beef, pork, or the family combos with both. Prices for the combos range from $60-$100 and you usually get enough to feed more than the number of persons recommended. I wouldn't give the proteins much more than a kiss of salt to bring out that exceptional flavor. A Korean lager like Cass or Hite is the perfect pairing for your meal as the neutral beer won't overpower any of the other flavors whether it be the meat or kimchi.  Service has never been an issue with us as there at least two servers in each section keeping a watchful eye. Should you need anything it'll be delivered in no time as they communicate directly to the kitchen through an intercom system. You can also use the call button if needed, but we've never had to.   Time your visit accordingly to avoid the one hour plus waits and once you're in, enjoy!",

All the waiters I interacted with during my time here were all so attentive and friendly. I came here with a big group of 12 people, and the waiters never failed to meet our needy requests for more sides. This is a non-AYCE place so do expect to spend $$$ and not be super full, but hey quality over quantity sometimes amiriteee?   THE FOOD:  -premium pork jowl, pork belly, outside skirt steak, both type of short ribs (HIGHLY recommend 10/10)  -brisket and grilled spicy pork belly (8/10)  -corn cheese (8/10)  -jap-chae (10/10)   Honestly, everything was really good, so don't read too much into my ratings :3 Treat yoself and get one of the Hobak family combos because the large really feeds about 4-6 people. Of course, the cherry on top of this entire experience was the rice pop ice cream and the slushie sojus that accompanied our meal. Do yourself a favor and eat here, you won't regret it!",

    "text": "I had dinner here with my brother, my dad, and my husband and we were not disappointed! The wait wasn't too bad and they had some nice benches to sit on outside.  Once we were seated, they started bringing out the side dishes. The pickled mustard leaf and pickled daikon were my favorite. My brother really enjoyed the potato pancake while my dad inhaled 2 orders of the kimchi and the iceberg salad. My husband, who isn't too big on vegetables, enjoyed the bean sprouts salad.   We decided to order the small family combo #2, which stated that is was good for 1-2 people. My dad, who had been there before, said there would be more than enough food for the 4 of us and he was totally right! They brought out a bowl of steamed egg, which was absolutely delicious and something I'll be trying to replicate at home. They also brought out a bowl of soup that had some vegetables, meat, and tofu. It was very good but the broth was a bit too salty for my taste. They also brought out some sushi rice.   They started rolling the meat out; beef brisket, angus steak, pork belly and pork neck. The brisket was yummy and perfectly sliced, this was my brother and my husbands favorite. Both of them said that they could easily have finished all of it haha. The angus steak was so tender and flavorful. This was easily my favorite and I'm not typically a meat eater. The pork belly was also good, I did feel like it could've been cooked a bit longer but my family enjoyed it. It was way too fatty for my taste. The pork neck was my second favorite and if we weren't so full, we probably would've ordered some more because there just wasn't enough of it haha.   After our meal, our server brought out the rice pop Ice cream, we chose the green tea flavor. They cut the sandwich into 4 pieces so that we could split it but honestly, I could've eaten the whole thing. Everybody really enjoyed it and we all polished off our pieces despite being full   Two complaints: Ventilation is very poor. My hair and all our clothes stunk up the car pretty good on the ride home. Our jackets are currently airing out in the garage. Second complaint is about the service. The guy that was doing the cooking for us was such a grouch and acted like he didn't really enjoy his job and/or didn't want to be there.   Other than those two things, everything else was great! We will be back for sure!",

I have to say my favorite was the short ribs, both marinated and spicy!  The meat was so tender.  Banchan was okay, but the ice cream sandwich at the end was refreshing.    They even had toothbrushes and toothpaste in the bathroom.  What a nice touch!  I have seen mouthwash before but not toothbrush.  The place was kept clean and the meat quality was good.

    "text": "Good ambience, KBBQ is pretty good, depending on what you order.  There were four of us and we ordered a beef combo (chadol, ggotsal, and galbi) and the pork belly.   Great Ggotsal - Very very good! Definitely my favorite from what we ordered, but I prefer my meats unmarinated. We asked for raw garlic and sesame oil, and they were quick to get this for us. The sesame oil comes in a little foil cup if you want to drop some garlic in there and put it on the grill Galbi - I usually don't prefer marinated meats, but I can't deny the tenderness of this meat. I also appreciated that there wasn't too much sauce and it wasn't salty. Service - our server (whose name I forgot, who's from Hawaii) was very attentive and friendly. She was always there and was good about asking how we like our meat cooked (they cook all the meat for you). I also appreciated that they frequently changed the grill without us having to ask.  Dessert - Our combo came with the green tea ice cream dessert. It's green tea ice cream with red bean and bbungtwigi on each side, reminiscent of a green tea boonguhbbang ice cream. My family loved it, and my brother said it was his favorite thing we ate! Ambience - I love the interior decorations. It flooded my parents with nostalgia, and they were constantly smiling and commenting on all the posters and signs.   Okay Naengmyun - we had both the bibim and the mul naengmyun. It was okay... I prefer Magal BBQ's naengmyun Gaeranjjim - I like that it comes in the stone pot and it's not poured in the side of the grill because the ones that come in the stone pot are richer and not dry  Bad Nothing special about the dipping sauces and the salt was plain Pork belly was terrible. There should be a good balance of pork fat and meat, but it was all fat. We barely touched it. I definitely do not recommend it.",

The combo came with Wagyu Bulgogi, skirt steak,  False Lean and maybe short ribs(?).   As noted by other yelpers, the waiters cook the meat for you.  I prefer to cook my own since some of the meat were underdone.   When the meat came out, we noticed that they were very fatty cuts.  I really don't like fat so I spent a lot of time trying to separate the fat from the meat.  I do like the fact that they change out the grill each time they cooked a new meat.  The sides were just ok.  Also, they served sushi rice instead of traditional Korean rice.  I normally like to eat my meat as a wrap  with traditional Korean rice, red/green leaf lettuce and fermented bean paste.  They didn't offer any of that.  The soup that came with the combo meal wasn't really that great. I've had better at other restaurants.  Overall, the meal was just ok. Nothing spectacular. Glad we tried it but this is not for us.",

Having a short few days in Vegas meant I was already making the most of it by eating the entire time. Not even 3 hours before I had been stuffing my face already. This ended up being meal number 4 for the day.   Luckily, this was not an AYCE place. This is more like those Japanese BBQ places with a set menu, but with Korean banchan. They have a large variety of banchan including some dishes I've never seen before. All the items were very good. The meat itself was well seasoned and very tender. Of course, you get smaller but more appropriate portions of meats, which I definitely appreciated. Had this been an \"eat as much as you can to get your money worth\" location, I would not have been able to participate as well.   Unlike other KBBQ joints, they cook everything for you. Instead of wasting your time trying not to burn your meat or figuring out if it's done or not, someone else does it. You are responsible for just putting it on your plate or directly into your mouth once it's done.   We had great attentive service in a lively atmosphere. I am definitely going to try to come back here again the next time I'm around.",

    "text": "One of the highlights of my trip to Las Vegas has got to be a visit to Hobak Korean BBQ.   Located at the corner of a small F& B complex in Chinatown, we arrived at dinner time and thankfully it wasn't very packed. The restaurant is moderately spacious and me quite fond of their interior design; retro with a twist of fun thanks to the colorful hanging lights - it really sets the mood and somehow they are able to recreate the feel of eating in the street of Korea itself.   The two of us were hungry (and greedy :P) so we ordered the large Hobak Beef Combo which are meant to be shared for 3-4 people. Our choices of meat: The brisket, aged short ribs and Angus B.L short ribs. Everything was scrumptious but my favorite cut was the Angus B.L short ribs -plenty of marbling and just melt in your mouth GOOD!!!   Along with the grilled meat, they gave us doenjang jiggae (bean paste stew) and steamed egg to relieve the grease, which were also highly enjoyable. Another factor that makes Hobak special is they have sushi rice (if you fancy something different) and the treat doesn't end there, they also compliment us with rice pop ice cream sandwich for a sweet ending :)   Pricing was a bit premium, with our large order costing $109, not including drinks, tax+tips, but it was totally worth it. The only downside I can think of was our waiter who did the grilling rushed the cooking process and start grilling new batch of meat before we barely finish with one. But that aside, all is well with Hobak and we left the restaurant with happy tummy and a lingering taste that made us craving for more.",

We got into town around midnight (keep in mind it closes at 4am) and decided to Yelp an awesome Korean BBQ place. This will pull up and stay on the board!! You won't be disappointed with service of menu selection/portion. They have your table set up prior to seating you so you can watch them bring out the sides and set up the grill. The staff was very tentative as they work as a group staying on their earpieces communicating. We ordered the family portion which serves 3-4 (which comes with seasoned beef and pork). We were literally stuffed before they cooked all of our meat. We called a taxi before dessert came just because we wanted to \"time it right\". Saturday night taxi service can be hectic. Dessert was very good and light (if it's even possible to say that since we stuffed our faces). I would return here and with friends and family. **Note: we brought our own sauce \"Laotian Signature Jeo Som\" if anyone knows good Lao/Thai food... You know this sauce goes wonderful with many things .",

    "text": "Went to Hobak 2 weeks ago.  Honestly, I don't really understand why this place has such a high rating.  The meat is pretty tasty with the wood burning grill, however, that was it.  This place needs a better ventilation system.  The vent comes all the way down blocking views of people's faces around the dinner table impeding conversation.  The vent is loud and it's still smokey!  Be warned, this place is very loud, smokey, and busy.  One of our waiters seemed pretty put-out about having to work for some reason.  The other 2 waiters were very nice and attentive.  I prefer restaurants where we can cook the meat ourselves.  Having someone stop by the table every 5 minutes to lean over and cook, interrupts the flow of conversation.  The banchan (side dishes) were ok.  There was not enough variety in the banchan for those of our party that do not enjoy spicy food.  And for those who do like super spicy foods, none of their dishes cut it (even though we specifically requested super spicy for the soup). There are tons of great Korean restaurants in the Vegas area.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "You guys know I love me some good Korean BBQ, but Hobak was such a let down. I have absolutely no desire to return here. Two stars instead of one because the meat quality is very good- but there is a lot more that goes into a restaurant experience to make it worth while. I was in a party of three and we ordered the Hobak Beef Combo. They served us the combo for two people. Why? I'll never know. Was one of us invisible? Anyway- the portions were tiny and I thought that was okay because I wasn't super hungry at the time anyway- but after we had eaten all the meat they brought out I though there is no way that can be it. I felt like I had barely eaten anything and I was embarrassed for the guests that had joined me (I chose the place to eat) because I know that they were still very hungry. So we ended up ordering another order of the marinated skirt steak and it took over 20 minutes for them to bring it out. TWENTY MINUTES PEOPLE! This is not the way Korean BBQ is supposed to work. The service was terrible. They give you very little banchan (just kimchi and radish) and none of the dipping sauces I usually enjoy with KBBQ (Doenjang, the salt with sesame oil over it, etc.) There was no lettuce or lettuce salad (except for one with ranch dressing and one with green onions and bean sprouts- but I like lettuce with Korean dressing with my KBBQ), rice paper, or radish to wrap your meat in. There was some marinated radish that was good but it was more like banchan than something to eat with your meat. They split one of the rice pop ice cream sandwiches between the three of us. Thanks. When the check came all I could think about was this was SOOOOOO NOT WORTH IT. I felt so bad for my guests and had I known it was going to be like THAT I never would have come here in the first place.",

We got the beef combo for two and had fairly healthy appetites going in...well we came out STUFFED! The brisket was great quality, and we chose the ribeye which melts in your mouth (my husband said probably his best ribeye ever) and the marinated skirt steak which was delicious, not overwhelming like I feel sometimes marinated meats can be...it was my favorite! The charcoal used in combination with the gas grill adds such a great smoky flavor to the meat also! Everything we had had SO much flavor, many items were a bit spicy, which we love, but others may want to be cautious. Our server BB was an amazing cook and super attentive to us. I enjoyed them cooking for me so we could just sit back and  enjoy our meal! We will definitely be coming back to this K BBQ spot, *and may never go anywhere else* hahaha!",

Not only was the service amazing but the meats they offer are incredibly fresh and high quality. I enjoyed the beef combination dinner and the hostess did a great job explaining the menu as it was my first time at the restaurant. Jayden was not my designated server but he was incredibly helpful throughout my entire meal (so helpful that I did not realize he was not my server until my actual server presented my check). Jayden made sure to constantly check on my table and make sure that everything brought out was to my satisfaction in a non-overbearing way. I also appreciate that the grills on each table have a vent above the grill to suction the fumes from cooking the meant and prevent you from smelling like a bbq after leaving the restaurant.

We had one of their platters for the table and it was more than enough delicious foods. The sides keep coming as well. You will not leave this place hungry or disappointed.",

Our grill was not working properly which the servers noticed. I'm not one to make a big deal about things as I am a cocktail server on the Strip myself, and I know that things happened. But, the staff just kind of overlooked the whole experience and went about their night as if it was no big deal. So, all in all, our food took longer to cook and no one seemed to care and that's unfortunate. I'll stick with WooNamJang for now.",

We did the family style combo #3 for the 5 of us and were very pleased.   The Angus spicy fried rice was really good also, but if you don't mind really spicy food, it's pretty spicy.   We also ordered soju where they can hit the bottle and make it into slush, very cool.   The dessert: mango rice pop ice cream was our favorite over green tea.   Highly recommend! Atmosphere was awesome, service, and food!",

There will be a wait and they do not take reservations, just just be aware.  But once you get to the table you have a perfect meal with tons of food at a reasonable price.  This is a great venue to take friends from out of town, the family, or even as a date night.    We had the pork and beef marinated platter.  Cooked for us to perfection, this is for sure not a \"2 person\" plate like the menu states.  With drinks and bonchon, this is easily a 3 person, or probably a 4 person platter.  They have the typical soju as well.  Service was good and the waiter was actually talking it up as he was cooking so it wasn't awkward or anything which is nice at a place like this.  My main issue with Hobak was that it was Americanized.  They didn't have many of the sauces and bonchon options that you would see at a more authentic place and instead stood firm with sriracha as their hot sauce and bok choy as their veggie.   COme here for a top Korean BBQ experience in Vegas.  These places have become hot lately and are popping up all over, but Hobak is still right up their in the top 3 for sure.",

    "text": "Hobak Korean Bbq is legit!!! I come here at least twice a week.   As soon as you walk in you feel the atmosphere jumping the music is rocking some kind of K pop or edc type!!    The servers are right in your face with the cooking and explaining of the food and the dipping sauces. Before the food comes out they load up on the side dishes.   I usually get the beef combo and you choose what type of meat you want. I get the skirt steak and the rib eye. This is to me the best combo  everything else  is  included like the brisket and steamed egg and spicy tofu soup. They call it spicy miso soup.   Then they start the cooking process and tell you what's what like the cheese dip and the sauce for the meat.    Now you have to appreciate the whole cooking process as these guys and girls are bending over cooking your food the whole time. This is cool as I don't have to get dirty... lol but the workers say that they are used to it!!    Then as you are eating they will come back and check on you to see if you need refills on any of the sides.  The dessert is next omg.... so if you have not tried this A-MAY-ZING creation that they bring you get down here!! Just choose your flavor of ice cream and they will do the rest! Vanilla, green tea, strawberry and mango.....   This place does not disappoint.... so why not perfect rating well I didn't like the fact that they bring you the bill and ask you to pay now as they are closing up... now they close at 2:00am but ask you to pay at 1:15? Weird but ok not the end of the world just felt like I was rushed out and they are still five other tables here still eating. Yes they asked all of them to pay.   So give this place a try and see for yourself and Happy Eating!!!!!!!",

They said something must have been wrong with their machine in the back because my order didn't go through. I would think after that mishap they'd be more attentive. Had to ask for my rice TWICE-that was supposed to already come with my order. Then when they were cooking my meat it was flying all over place/off the grill so there goes half my steak. To apologize for my experience our waitress decides to give me a 10% coupon for next time. WHAT?! Lol!!!   Lastly, this place is over priced and their meat is not marinated/tasteless. Go to an AYCE KBBQ place instead. Been to Gen, Tofu Hut, & Hwaro- all top notch!",

Most importantly, the beef here is well marbled, fresh, and cooked to perfection.  We ordered the small beef combo (brisket, rib eye, skirt steak) and a pork belly. All were extremely good.  Our server, Tawny even managed to cook our rib eye medium rare (every other person has overcooked the beef thinking any pink constitutes medium rare).

When I came here we just order two plates of the marinated beef and we got a bunch of free side dishes. ( what I love about Korean BBQ free side dish) let me tell you the meat is such amazing quality that the meat melts in your mouth like butter and the marinate on it is on point. Everything was just super delicious from the meat, rice, soup, eggs, salad, Kimchee, to the pickle veggies. And it's free refills on the side dish. One cool thing I like about this place is that your sever cooks the meat for you so can just chit chat with your friends and not have to worry about cooking. Check this place out if your ever in town. It's not on the strip and it's not 24 hours so you know the food is 10 times better and will be worth the time and money spent coming here to check this place out. This place does get pretty busy so come early to get a table.",

Here, I'm able to enjoy a great Korean meal with my family without the stigma of not being from Korea.  Moreover, the food is outstanding; the meat is fresh and the banchons are wonderful.    The service, something lacking at other Korean spots, is outstanding.  The servers are friendly and quickly meet the needs of all customers.  The staff is especially helpful when it comes to small children.  Without prompting, they offered to keep the grill nearer to the kids off and were quick to bring kid-friendly foods out early.  Try Hobak.  You won't regret it.",

Service wise I think I never had this much of an attentive servers for Kbbq ever! 5 severs serving us?! I think thats like the best and we didn't even had to ask for to bring this and that or call to do our meat.

I also love their egg soup but the second time I went it was a bit burnt. One of the meats I tried (forgot which it was) had no flavor so it was a let down but everything else was amazing.

    "text": "Hobak (which means pumpkin or sharing something good) will now be my favorite Korean Bbq place. It has only been open for just over a month but is has raised the bar as far as Korean Bbq is concerned. It is not an AYCE bbq joint but the quality and taste of the short ribs and other meats more than make up for the measured portions. I would prefer quality over quantity. We ordered the family package good for 2. If you are a meat lover, you can order the larger family combo with more meat.   The servers cook the meats for you so you can just relax and enjoy. But since you don't directly control the pace of cooking you may need to allot a little more time when dining here. I would say it is worth the additional minutes. One of our sever/cook is Yooka. She is very nice, gracious and helpful.   We will definitely be back and we highly recommend this joint - great good, excellent service.  Short note:  they have disposable toothbrushes in the ladies room and a tube of toothpaste for anyone who cares to freshen up. Nice touch.",

    "text": "I've been to several different Korean BBQ joints in Vegas and Hobak is by far the BEST!!!! Everything from the quality of food, service, atmosphere, and price is on point. I know it's not all you can eat but if you want good food/meat, AYCE is not the way to go.  Came here with a couple friends and was greeted by a HUGE sign that lists all the free services Hobak offers: bottled water and slushies while you wait, charging your phone, bibs to protect your clothes, bags to put your purse and jacket in so the smoke/smell won't permeate into them, toothbrushes and mouth wash in the bathroom, and no corkage fee so you can bring your own bottles of wine (up to 2 bottles!!). It's little details like these that can really up the restaurant experience! And this is just the beginning.   The interior of this place is adorable! Designed to look like the outdoor streets and alleys of Korea, the street signs, rooftops, and light posts are so cute. I love that the grills are on those circular oil drums, giving it an authentic feel. All the workers have coordinated black/white cheetah print outfits (don't worry, they're cool, not tacky!) and everyone is so chipper! The waitresses were very attentive and eager to serve.   The food was THE BEST PART! We ordered kalbi, pork belly, and brisket. The kalbi was amazing. The marinade was not too sweet and savory, the meat was thick yet tender. The pork belly and brisket were good quality cuts and came with dipping sauces. And for those who don't want to grill your own meat, the ladies will cook, cut, and serve the meats for you! Of course, grilling is half the fun but sometimes you just wanna stuff your face with meat. :) Our meal also included a soybean paste stew (freaking bomb!!!) and an egg souffle. The side dishes are not your typical side dishes (they're the street style) so don't be expecting no fish cake or pickled seaweed here.   After our meal, they brought us free dessert: your choice of ice cream flavor between 2 puffed rice crackers. Holy frick that was delicious and the perfect way to end everything off.   Hobak beats any other Kbbq restaurant in Vegas and the price is reasonable if not cheaper than the other places I like. I know this is gonna be a regular stop of mine every time I'm in Vegas!",

Big fan of their beef rib eye and brisket. Very nice and hot jap chae too. If you order a combo you get a free I've cream rice pop which tastes so good. Mango is my favorite.   While not ACYE, the meat and service outweigh that. The servers are nice and cook your meal very well. And they come by often to check on your meat and to change the grill/plate so that your experience is hassle free. And the bathrooms are clean and even provide toothbrushes and tooth paste. There is even free snacks in the front while you wait. In the summer it was slushies and in the winter it was popcorn.   I've made sure to visit here when I come to Vegas last three times and I plan to do so in the future",

I would've given this place a 5 star but the last time I came I waited for my soju shot glass for like 30 minutes because they supposedly had to \"polish\" them.

I learned so much about Korean BBQ culture from her. I love that she helped us cook everything so we could just watch and enjoy the process.

The Side dishes were really good, tinge bit spicy salad was awesome, if your asian you can definitely get more rice. The Desserts has a limited selection however the sandwiched Ice Cream with Crackers was a good experience.   Ambiance: The restaurant's dining is typical Korean BBQ, each table has their own fan which removes most of the smoke from grilled meats so expect to smell like BBQ when you come out of the restaurant. The whole vibe to the restaurant is come in, stay and drink for awhile; great for get togethers talking to each other while cooking your food, so socialized drinking and dining!  Service: Service is pretty good, the waiter was attentive with our orders and definitely was on point with our request. Eg. how do you like the steak cooked, rice, extra side dishes, etc. The only drawback to the restaurant is that you definitely have to come in early otherwise you have to wait for 30 to 45 minutes to get a seat. (REMEMBER THE DINING AND DRINKING)   Overall: Definitely something to try out, and  definitely a new good KOREAN BBQ restaurant. Looks like Vegas dining is improving every year!",

The sauce and dried sea weeds on top of the fried rice made it very flavorful!  The servers cooked all the meat for us.  We can enjoy our meal without worrying about cooking.   We came by few days ago and there was a long wait. Came st 5:30 on a Wednesday and we got seated right away.    Love their desert too!! This is a must try Korean BBQ restaurant in Vegas!",

Definitely good times. Will eat again next time we're in town.",

BUT, their ice cream desert was best part of whole dining experience. And, I liked their decoration, which reminded me of \"Kang HoDong\" place. Hopefully better taste bud experience next time.",

It was a hit with my friends, and it seemed like it'd take a hit on my wallet as well once I heard the prices. It felt like my bank account would be experiencing the 2008 economic crash 2.0. It's not an all you can nor are the prices on the cheaper end, but it is so worth it!! IT WAS DELICIOUS. MY MOUTH WATERED JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. I LOVE HOBAK. My favorite though, has been the hot tofu beef stew, which was very much worth it's price. Whopping $9.99 and it comes with rice, a variety of side dishes, and a big tofu stew. I was so full at the end, and I still needed a to go container. I went with two friends whose stomachs are comparable to the Mariana Trench, and they too were having a hard time finishing everything, but we were all enjoying our meal. I didn't see any problem with employees, I enjoyed my time well. Really loved the food and establishment, thank you!",

There are a lot of great kbbq place in LA, but we still miss this place enough to come back one year later. This time, food is exactly how we remembered from last time. Props to the owner for consistent food quality! Can we open one in LA pleaseeeeee!!!",

Hobak is up there in my Top 10, but there are things you should know/expect prior to your visit.   - They offer higher quality cuts of beef and pork compared to most other Korean BBQ restaurants. You can taste the difference and the flavors are quite good.  - They are NOT All You Can Eat. Most places offer AYCE for around $25-30. This place doesn't and after tax/tip your bill will average around $40pp. I include that because you're were for the Quality, not Quantity. - The sides dishes are okay. They offer the standard kimchee, radishes and other vegetables, but usually most Korean BBQ places offer 6+ different sides. This place had only a few. - Service was excellent and they were attentive with flipping the meat and getting refills.   Overall, we had a great experience and will be looking to come back next time we're in Vegas. Just understand that it can get pricey and you're paying for a higher quality of meat.",

I recommend ordering a set because a la carte can be pretty expensive. My favorite is the beef set. I look forward most to the short rib which melts in your mouth and the chewy cartilage that is stuck to the bone :)  Included in the set you get your regular banchan,  two types of salad, (a spicy bean sprut one and a mayo iceberg one) as well as a doenjang jjigae and steamed egg. To finish, a red bean cracker with your ice cream flavor of choice.",

This place not only had premium meat choices but quality over quantity.  Its not an AYCE resto, but they will cook the meat for you while you kick back and relax!!   Great atmosphere and it seems like you were in Korean town.    After all that eating.. go to the restroom and go brush your teeth & use some mouthwash! (This comes complimentary) How Amazing?!!!

    "text": "My first Korean barbecue experience was here at Hobak. The only reason why I chose this restaurant to dine at was because Andrew Zimmerman recommended it. (I think I saw it on Travel Channel or the Food Network) Also, my girlfriend and her husband highly recommended it. Thankfully for my first experience here my friend and her husband came with us.   Something to know is this restaurant does not take reservations and they are very busy so do not show up with a empty stomach because there is going to be a wait. We ended up waiting about 35 mins for our table.   Once inside the atmosphere reminded me of a nightclub. There was a lot going on and it was very loud. Being that this was my first time here, I felt a little overwhelmed and wasn't really sure what was going on. Our server was very nice we let her know that it was our first time but the people that were with us had been there before. We were a party of 4 she recommended that we ordered 2 family meals and adding in a extra protein. She told us that this would be saving us money in the long run. (To be honest with you I didn't even take a look at the menu because the couple that we are with just agreed to what she had suggested). The table was crowded with lots of different items to taste (dipping sauces, salt, salads, soup, egg souffle...etc) we had so much food. Probably could have done without the desert but it was included in the family meal. The whole experience was very cool, I did like that our server cook the meat for us. However, I would've like to do it myself because some of the meat was undercooked tremendously and some was overcooked. The other thing that I noticed was a lot of the meat had a lot of fat on it. If you're not one that likes fat on your steak this is your warning. My husband is one of those people so I ate the fatty meat and he ate most of the shaved meat.   I would highly recommend this place if it's your birthday because they go all out singing and dancing (which was a huge surprise because I wasn't expecting that! )They have amazing Korean cocktails made of soju and the Korean beer was delicious.   Last but not least you must check out the bathroom! Not only do you get a lesson in Korean blaring through the speaker they also offer throwaway toothbrushes, toothpaste and mouthwash. (Loved that)   Overall four stars out of five because of the meat debacle and I felt a little bit rushed to get out of our table since people were waiting.",

Our server cooked all of the meats one at a time for us. The short ribs were the best out of the 3 meats we chose. It had great flavor and was super tender. All of the meat was very tender and seemed to be top quality, but the the ribeye and brisket weren't seasoned or marinated at all. We also had the spicy rice with beef which was wonderful. All of the accoutrements that came with the meal were great as well. Hobak had some of the best Kimchi I've ever tasted. My only issue is that there were long periods of time where no one came back to the table. We could see our server sitting in the back of the restaurant, but then she didn't come back to our table for very long stretches of time. Would have understood if the place had been crowded, but it wasn't.  Overall it was still a great dining experience and we had a good time.",

The bathroom has mouthwash, toothbrush and toothpaste.  You will still be dazzling and minty fresh for your date!  Second time here in a month and I must say, I am simply amazed.  Why would I, he who scarfs down food quicker than you can say \"what does Hobak mean in English\", be amazed when I eat so fast.  That is just it. Normally I am eating so fast I really cannot tell the difference, but here I find that the quality of meat, the marinade, and everything is just, well, as Jungkook of BTS says, \"You are the cause of my Euphoria\".  Yes, Hobak, you are the cause of my Euphoria.  1. WAIT - Yes, if you are going to go to this place during normal eating hours, be prepared to wait.  No reservations, busy, busy and long lines. This place was built to wait. There is a tremendously large waiting area outside, with misters for the heat. They are prepared for you to wait.  2. PARTY - Just two of us?  We can make it if we try?  Well, that was a great Grover Washington song, but good luck. You are gonna have to wait like everyone else. Big party, small party, they can accommodate nearly all sizes. You just have to wait.  3.  Best time to go with no wait - 3:00 pm or 11:00 am when they open. Mondays are oddly busy and just as odd, Saturday night not as busy...   4.  Pork Belly or Big Belly - Seokjin of BTS famously says, \"\"Win. Lose. I don't care because at the end of the day I still have this face so who's the real winner here?\" So, no matter about the wait no matter about what you order, you are gonna love the food here and I still have a full big belly full of Korean BBQ, so who's the real winner here?  By the way, the Pork Belly is amazing!   5.  Service - Top notch, friendly, they will cook for you and for other tables. They don't miss a beat and they will help you order and help you figure out what to eat with what if you are not on your A game with what to dip in what.  6.  The food - I went for the large Family Combo 1 large because No. 2 son was in town and celebrating his birthday. He works out like crazy and has high metabolism, so he hadn't eaten all day.  This came with Brisket, Pork Belly, Short Ribs and Aged Pork Ribs.  Also ordered the Angus Beef Honey Tartare and some Cold Noodles to polish this off. This was enough for like 6 people and the three of us had plenty to take home.  7.  AYCE - No way. This is not AYCE and frankly, it was much better anyway and plenty of food.  8.  Sugar, oh Honey Honey - While this was a great sone by the Archies, Did you miss my point on the Angus Beef Honey tartare in point 6 above?  This is my sole reason for coming here. Steak Tartare. Raw beef simply seasoned is one of the most amazing dishes that I love to love and here, at Hobak, was the first time I have tried this in a Korean restaurant. No, I wasn't crying. I had allergies.  The Angus Beef Honey tartare is a must if you like it raw.  9.  Speaking of Sugar - if you order the family combo, you get your choice of desert.  What else can I say, this place I really like. they are open from 11-11, and pick your time wisely.  Great place to come and enjoy.  When you are done,  don't be shy.  Order desert! We went for the Rice Pop Ice Cream.    They only give you two order with the large family combo, but it was like 8 pieces.  Huge slices of ice cream in a Rice Pop sandwich.  Yep, Almost just like Clemenza said to Rocco in the Godfather, \"leave the meat, take the Rice Pop Ice Cream.\"  You are gonna love it.  GK says, check this place out.",

The quality of the meat was off the charts. Compared to the places we've ate at.  First off the wait on this Saturday summer night around 7pm was 30mins. While waiting outside in the heat, they had mist coolers, 1 video game and lots of seats outside. As well 2 flavors of slushies to keep you cool.   As we entered everyone greeted us and said hello. There were several tv's playing music videos and music playing. There was one issue that it appears to be an issue at Korean bbq and that's the smoke. You can tell they were doing the best to keep the air flowing. They had 4 large industrial fans going. But it was still smoky.   We ordered the small beef combo, $71. It was plenty for us 3. We added the glass noodles and it was too much food for the 3 of us. The quality of the beef was excellent!!",

The staff is super attentive and they cook the meal for you right at your table. Each table has a little buzzer so you can call for assistance whenever you need it.   I highly recommend the brisket, and all the sushi rice. They have good ice cream deserts that are sandwiched between rice cakes.   They have one of the best birthday celebrations I have ever seen. It's a desert with a bright sparkler and the whole place erupts in cool music for that moment. It's a fun experience, and doesn't last long enough to bother anyone.   It can get loud in here when it's full, and late nights they tend to blast the music.   It's really a cool hip restaurant with awesome food. I highly highly recommend.",

Was with my dad and my vegetarian buddy that lives in Vegas. Food wasn't that great, very fatty and the gristle in the beef was a big turn off. The kimchi fried rice was quite delicious though.  They no longer have the fresh made Soju's especially the mango one.  Very expensive meal for being unsatisfied with subpar proteins.   The highlight of the meal was the table next to us celebrating a birthday and the way the staff sung the song and had the bright sparkler was cool.  Might go back might not, this used to be my favorite Korean BBQ in all of Vegas,",

It was very thinly sliced, I was looking forward to the thick cut, but it was still tasty. You get 1 refill of the soup and steamed egg and unlimited refills of the other side dishes. Theres free pineapple and fruit punch slushie at the door while you wait and misters outside to take a little edge off the desert heat. I'm FOR SURE coming back.",

This is not a grill your own Korean BBQ, they will do it for you to make sure that it everything is cooked perfectly. The meats are marinated very nicely and the sides offered are great. It is never ending with the sides as you can order more as you go. This place is great for a group of people who like eating off the grill with their chopsticks!  Don't forget to stay for dessert which is included with some of the meal plans. The ice cream sandwiches are phenomenal and you get to choose two flavors. So definitely leave some room for dessert.  The service here is great and the restaurant is Uber stylish. This is one fabulous Korean BBQ on Spring Mountain!",

This was a lot of food for when you're not too hungry. Everything was delicious and very flavorful.  Service was quick and friendly!

Things to expect Food: Quality cuts of meat but limited selection in seasoning. They cook your meat for you. It's family style. They have lots of sides but some you may need to ask for (they don't have radish paper R.I.P). They have a limited amount of tables for big parties so PLEASE CALL AHEAD and they can seat only up to 10 people. We got the Family combo 2 and pork combo which I thought was a great deal for 10 people They also charge for certain sides so make sure to ask. Between all of us and Soju, we spent only around 30 a person with tip. Favorite part was their interesting ice cream sandwiches made of a rice cracker like sandwich around the ice cream in 4 flavors.  Ambiance: It's a hip grungy warehouse look with loud music since it's in an echoing room. Probably not the best date night idea if it's your first date and you are trying to hear.   FYI, parking is also horrific as it's in an office building look of space and shares it with a coffee shop that's popular as well.",

The meats are a cook it yourself type place but The nice thing about it is that the employees start off cooking it for you so you don't have to do the entire thing yourself. They then walk away to help other customers and you can cook it to your liking. I definitely like it this way because sometimes I overcook or burn the meat when I'm doing it myself. The melted cheese and sushi rice is my favorite part about the meal that is unique to this place:) if you haven't tried to cheese with your meats, try it! It's so good!! We also ordered fried rice on the side which was bomb!",

It also comes with unlimited sides: potato pancake, bean sprout salad, regular salad(my favorite! The dressing is so delicious), rice, steamed eggs, bok choy, salt, hobak sauce(another favorite!) and much more I can remember LOL.  They cook the meat at the table for you, as you like. Everything is so delicious here, I'll be returning each time I come to Vegas. The dessert was also delicious!",

Food:  - ordered the beef combo for 2 ($72) for 2 people which comes with brisket, pork belly, short rib & spicy pork  - comes with steamed egg, rice and soup  - the combo includes sushi rice balls to make your own meat on rice sushi balls  - also comes with ice cream sandwich  Service:  - service was great as they cook the meat for you - wait time was minimal as we got there closer to 10pm    For the price we paid, we didn't think it was worth it. Having tried so many different korean bbq places in LA, our expectations are definitely high. While it satisfied for the time being, we thought it was more mediocre.",

We were in a bit of a hurry but we were there before the usual rush so our wait was only 15 minutes or so.  The servers knew we were a little pressed for time and were so accommodating.  They kept coming over to see if we were ready for the next round and were super friendly.  The meal was delicious too! I will definitely be back when I have some time to just enjoy!",

The service is incredible -- they will cook all the meat for you right at your table, exactly as you like it.  Our waiter Exo checked on us multiple times and even gave free refills of our side dishes. I personally prefer non-marinated so we had short ribs which were superb. The marinated bulgogi you dip in melted cheese is also a treat. If you are in town make sure to stop by. The ambience, decorations, and vibe are real fun and cool. All meat is cooked in charcoal which adds a great flavor and incredible smell to it. So if you're in town, stop by! You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Arrived around 5:15pm and waited 5 minutes for a table for two. Took my daughter out to dinner and we decided to try something new. Never had Korean BBQ. When our table was ready, there was an assortment of Korean dishes like Kim Chi and condiments set up; probably why it took 5 minutes to seat us. As we were snacking on the veggies, we decided on the family combo for two, which had brisket, aged pork rib, aged short rib, & marinated skirt steak. Watching the meat cooking in front of us was an education; next time I can do it myself! A waiter/cook would come by and start the first meat and by the time we were finished eating it, the second meat had been put on the grill, and so on. There was so much food there, I forgot to ask what one cold soup was that had a tomato slice and tofu in it. Everything tastes great and the skirt steak was very tender. For dessert, we had a mango rice pop ice cream; an ice cream sandwiched between two thin rice cakes; a very nice way to end the meal. The service was great! I only wish we had found this place sooner! We are definitely going back! Oh, and the bathrooms have toothbrushes and toothpaste for customers because \"nobody likes bad breath!\" The only improvement I could think of would be to have a first-timer's guide to how dinner is done here, but that's nitpicking.",

After checking on the websites, we found this Hobak Korean BBQ and decided to give a try.  Yes, it's really good BBQ.  Each meal is cooked by their staff.  Since the place is not big, there are approximate 20 x 4-person tables, 4 x 6-person tables ,and 3 x 10-tables.  It takes us a 30 minutes to get it and eat.  You have big party, and just wait for other to finish the meal.    I would recommend. Refresh beef directly from Texas is awesome and it's worth the wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

For $94.99 (without tax), the three meat choices that we had were honestly tasty and tender, but they were brought out in considerably small amounts and were not refillable. Being accustomed to the cheaper, just-as-good AYCE KBBQ spots in Orange County, CA, we were displeased that we were not full at all after finishing the beef combo. Overall, we thought our meal wasn't reasonably priced and therefore won't be coming back. Though, it would have been reasonably priced if the three meat choices had been refillable.",

Once, when I was with my family and my mother didn't like the way the meat tasted due to the grill we had. The staff was happy to change it as well as give us a new set of meat since the meal was cut short because of the grill. Some of my favorite items eat here are the corn cheese, brisket, marinated skirt steak and the bean paste stew. The few things I'd have to complain about is that they don't take reservations- there is a long wait. However, they have a free slushy machine which sort of makes up for the wait. Another downside is that it's also expensive here, but I feel like the food served here is quality. I have eaten here many times and every time was great.",

(We went on a Tuesday at 5) My family ordered the large family combo and that was very filling.   Although there is a grill at the center of the table, you do not grill your own meat. The waiters and waitresses grill your meat for you. So you just sit back and enjoy your meal~ although, I will have to say it was a bit awkward when we watched our server grill in silence lol but that didn't matter because he was so kind and attentive! Overall, I would totally recommend Hobak to anyone visiting Las Vegas! It was the best meal my family had since our arrival here!",

And steam egg and bean soup were serve 30 mins after we already finished the 1st of meat after complaining to the manager.  3. Side dishes never got refilled  4.

    "text": "This korean bbq place is a unique experience.  From when you walk in, the dishes that are served, the pull down hood system, and the staff, it was a great experience.    We were seating and the coals were on.  Shortly after, traditional korean appetizers/side dishes were served, except there were a few that I haven't seen in most korean places, such as the bean sprouts and green onion salad (yum).  Also, Hobak has their own sauce that includes onions and jalapenos.  This is not an all you can eat place, but that is more than okay.  Why?  Because you can actually take what you didn't finish home!  I was super stuffed!  My bro and I got the beef combo.  This comes with beef brisket, angus boneless short ribs, Hobak marinated skirt steak, bean paste stew, steamed, egg, and rice pop ice cream.   The servers cook for you!  Which is great because they did a better job cooking than I usually do.  We started with the brisket on the grill.  The server brought some sushi rice with a piece of wasabi in the middle.  When the brisket was done, he took a piece of the brisket, put it on top of the sushi rice, told me to dip it with their Hobak sauce, and I had a few more of those after!  The brisket with the wasabi, sushi rice, and Hobak sauce was amazing!  After the brisket was done, our server changed our grill, and it was on to the mesh grill.  Again, I'm glad he's cooking because I wouldn't how to handle cooking on this mesh grill.  Especially when I watched him cook our food, the fire was blazing!  After he cooked both sides, he sliced the big slab of meat to many pieces.  Great with the Hobak sauce or the side of salt and sesame oil.    The Hobak marinated skirt steak was the best!  No need for sauces for that!  We were getting stuffed at that point and had a bunch of leftovers, so we got those to go.    Mix the steam egg with rice, and you got a great combo.  I couldn't get enough of the bean paste stew.  It was spicy and full of great flavor.  At this point I was so stuffed, but I somehow always have room for desert.  We got the rice pop green tea ice cream.  It was very easy to eat ice cream sandwich.  An ice cream sandwich where the rice pop outer layer tastes like a waffle cone.  Again I was stuffed, but it was so good, I devoured the whole thing.",

My boyfriend and I came here after a cold and windy night at SEMA Ignited. Hobak was the cure to our empty stomachs. We ordered the family dinner set 2.  Everything that we ate was so good! The banchan was flavorful and well seasoned. The meats that were cooked by our server was on point and the cuts of meat were very high quality and fresh. I loved every minute and bite. I was surprised and happy with the many grill changes that they did. It kept the meat from getting burnt. I would definitely come back here. It's totally worth the price and amount of food that you're getting.",

The food wasn't mind blowing as nothing really stood out for me but all in all I left there satisfied i didn't give it 4 stars because the other 3 people in my party didn't think it was too great but maybe we are just spoiled !",

I was worried that it would he too loud to just chat. The ambiance was fun and noise level was ok for a weekday night. Our server was friendly and helpful but he didn't explain what each of the sides were before the meats came out. No worries, we're adventurous eaters, but we still had to ask. We didnt care for the \"soups\" that were brought out but enjoyed the steamed egg and seaweed salad. We ordered the family dinner for 2, reasonably priced for all that we got: skirt steak, short rib, spicy short rib, and spicy pork belly. Our server cooked our meats for us and asked how we liked our meats. Our faves were the short ribs and spicy short rib! The cheese sauce was ok. The meats were seasoned enough that we didnt feel it was necessary. We were disappointed in the pork belly. It looked like shredded pork after it was cooked. We were expecting something crisper. Anyhoo ice cream sandwich dessert was included which was a nice surprise. We left happy and full",

I found Hobak on yelp searching for Korean food little did I know that Andrew Zimmerman had made a visit the restaurant had the episode on repeat in the waiting area.  We had not made a reservation and arrived right before the dinner rush hour.  They only had canned sodas but their drink menu is extensive I went for the usual IPA.  We selected a family combo for 4 people I believe it cost 103 and you have 3 different selections to choose from combo number 3 worked for us. We had a party of 6 half children and this was plenty for us it comes with a bean paste soup and egg. All the starters such as salad and kimchee.  This type of bbq they cook for you I know at most bbq places in ktown in LA they don't but I like this.  I ordered the cheesy corn and kimchee soup on the side and I couldn't have made a better choice both plates were delicious.  I would go back to this place for sure",

We came at around 1am on a Friday which was perfect because they had just finished their late evening rush and there was tons of open seating. It's NOT all you can eat, but the quality of just about everything we tried made up for it and none of us walked out hungry.   We got the family meal for $89.99 to share with 4 people. Along with this came a denjean chigae (spicy bean soup) which was excellent and just as I remember. They even had small bits of beef in the soup which isn't always the norm for the dish...nice bonus. The kim chee was good, not as funky as I like but better than most places. They were happy to bring out additional soup above the refill as they noticed how much I liked it. Other side dishes like a steamed egg were also included.  In all, the family meal had about 4 meats to try, all well explained by the friendly server and cooked for you. They ask how you like it, medium, medium-rare, etc and they cook to your liking and divide the portions out evenly among the group. The quality of the meat was outstanding.  At the end we got mango and green tea rice cake ice cream with red beans used to glue the rice cake to the ice cream. Interesting and original though I felt the rice cake didn't add anything but make it a unique way of doing up ice cream.  Nothing to subtract a star over, but it would be nice if they included lettuce leaves to make a True Korean style lettuce wrap. Also, no rice was given to accompany the soup or any part of the meal all evening, perhaps you have to ask for one or both of the above.  Overall, I would 100% recommend this place as the reviews don't lie, yelp peeps nailed this one.",

You will almost always wait. Be prepared. The music is kind of loud outside and it's all EDM. I feel it's a little weird. But, whatever.   Some of the servers/cooks do NOT do a good job at explaining the process. They are more traditional style here, so they do the cooking for you.   Our server/cook was super nice, but not very attentive. That was the only downside.   Plan to be here for awhile. This is a feast, bitches.   The best meats we had: The skirt steak. Holy balls, amazing.  And the spicy pork belly. Perfect tenderness and spice!  Love this place, and I cannot wait to go back and get me some meat sweats!",

It was extremely flavorful and the marbling rendered down just right - outstanding!  If your experience with skirt steak is based on an average order of Tex-Mex fajitas, you need to recalibrate your experiences with Hobak's version.  On other hand, you may never want to eat fajitas again.    Service was very good, they even cooked everything for you.  The place was very clean.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable visit.

The menu is very simple, and is NOT all you can eat. The best way to order here is to get the Hobak combos that either serve 1-2 or 3-4. You can choose beef, pork, or a combination. Otherwise, you can order a la carts.   For our party of 4, we decided to order the large beef combo, and added Bi bim bap (rice dish) and jap chae (noodle dish).  We chose the marinated short rib and regular short rib with the standard brisket. This was more than enough for us, and it even came with ice cream sandwiches at the end!    The service was great here. There are plenty of servers here who refill your drinks and ban chan (side dishes) frequently. And they also cook the meat for you too. I would definitely come back here again. Prices are higher than AYCE, but you're getting top quality meat and don't feel so disgusting when you leave.",

This place focuses on quality and its a kbbq place where the food is cooked in front of you but it's mainly cooked by the servers. Side dishes include a salad, a bean sprout slaw, Kim Chee pancake and Kim Chee. The meal also comes with one bean paste soup and one steamed egg. First course with brisket and they give you rice balls like nigiri style and you're supposed to put the cooked beef on top of the rice to eat it like sushi... Interesting. Never seen that before. The next course is a huge steak... Not sure what cut but maybe ribeye. The steak was really juicy. They didn't season it so you can dip it into the sesame oil salt or spicy sauce. It's really good when wrapped with rice paper. They also served veggies grilled and you're supposed to dip it into this pot of melted cheese fondue style. Last was the marinated short rib. That was really tender and and juicy. Flavor was great. At the end of the meal we ended with ice cream sandwiches in crispy rice crackers. The green tea flavor is the best I think.   What I really like about this place is the quality of food. Top notch. Service was good.  They also had free water and slushies for customers waiting on the hot patio.   I knocked a star down because in the middle of our meal the freaking vent fell onto the grill and fire and scared everyone. They changed our grill but continued cooking the piece of meat the vent fell on top of. They apologized but other than that there was no compensation.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite (non-AYCE) Korean bbq spot! My boyfriend and i always get the family combo for 2-3 people and it's more than enough food. Their banchan is basic but good, i wish they had more of a variety but it's ok, I'll survive haha. The restaurant is clean and the decor is super cute. The biggest thing for me is the quality of their meat. It is always fresh! (I feel like I've gotten sick at so many Korean bbq spots out here). Their servers are always very attentive and friendly! I like that they cook the meat for you (thank you to all the Hobak staff!). Oh.. & i love their dessert! Rice cracker ice cream sandwiches with red bean! Yum!   Wait! One more thing! They have disposable toothbrushes, toothpaste, & mouthwash in their bathroom. How awesome and thoughtful is that?! You will still come out of there smelling like Korean bbq but your breath won't!",

The place is decorated as Korean street style and everything looks very clean. They have complimentary slushy machine and water in the cooler for people who are waiting to be seated. They also have toiletry items in the restroom for customers to freshen up their breath after meal. Definitely a very thoughtful touch.   On our most recent trip we ordered the large beef combo and a side of cream corn. Our meat was cooked a little dark this time. I think the server saw my sister trying to scrape off the burnt parts  and when it was time to get the check she told us \"I took out the cream corn because I burnt your meat. I'm really sorry about that\". We were surprised by the server's attention to detail and her sincerity. The meat was a little dark but not overly burnt. My sister is just the type who is extremely nitpicky about consuming burnt stuff but any other person would eat it without thinking twice about it. We felt that this place really cares about their customers which sometimes is hard to experience at kbbq places. Definitely will be recommending this place to many friends!",

We get to our table and there is all kinds of side dishes already set up. Our service was great from beginning to end.  My boyfriends sister order a combo family dinner of some sort plus a two person dinner. And two sides of rice (one spicy one not). The food was great! My top two out of everything we got was the skirt steak and the short rib. The rice was great had flavor, I ate the not spicy one, and the sides where also amazing.   I would defiantly come back here. Most Korean BBQ places you cook it yourself, as you can here, but they have some do it for you unless you say something.  I found this great because I could relax and have good conversation and they food was all cooked just right. Great for larger groups!",

    "text": "Just like how I never help my husband on long drives, I don't help him cook at AYCE Korean BBQ places either. Eating at Hobak was a real treat for us both, since we get even higher quality meats and we both get to enjoy it without the pressures of cooking. The wait looks daunting at times, but they are pretty good at expediting service and turning tables over. There is a popcorn machine near the front, usually blocked by people waiting, but a good way to tide you over if the wait is long. My recommendation is to come here as a couple of with a group of 4 so you're not waiting too long for the large party tables, especially on the weekends. Although there was a ton of people outside for the holidays, we got sat immediately since our party was smaller.   There is plenty of banchan to go around, and although not AYCE, the dinner sets have always left us full and with leftovers. The reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is your server can really make or break your experience. The first time we went here, our server was amazing at juggling all his tables and cooking the meats very well. He even had time to have conversations with his tables and get to know people a bit. On our second visit, our server was running around like his head was cut off and you could tell he wasn't doing things efficiently. He'd walk to a table, forget what he needed to bring, walk to the kitchen, then kind of wander, before being reminded by his table what they needed, if the table didn't already ask someone else. Luckily the other staff members picked up his slack a bit. However, when he did cook our food, he overcooked items and at some points, you could just tell he was poking at the meat with the tongs, not for any purpose other than that's what he saw other people doing. He was also pretty tall and looked like he struggled bending down to do the cooking, so he couldn't really see what he was doing. That experience made us miss being able to cook our own food and be masters of our own dinner destiny, so we haven't been back in the new year, but I don't think we'll be away for too long - I love their desserts! Their ice cream sandwiches are my favorite part of the meal - we opt for strawberry, which has a little bit of chocolate in it as well.",

This dude next to us polished off a whole set 3 by himself.  I'm glad he got a whole set cuz he looked like he woulda eaten us if he had still been hungry...  the 4 of us shared a large set 3 and it was just about right.    The only reason this place doesn't get a full five stars is the relatively poor selection of pan chan (that's those little side dishes for you kbbq neophytes.). While they were good, there really should have been a better selection considering the price.  Otherwise, food was great, service was great, all happy!  Yay!",

The meat towards the end was crazily spicy was the only issue I had because it was too spicy to the point where I couldn't eat it. But the rest of the meats were flavorful and addicting! (Brisket was my favorite!) Dip them with cheese for more flavors. :) Kimchi side dish was to die for, it was spicy but to an extent with rich flavors and coloring. The soup was good.. but I've had better. The pricing was decent they have combo deals for a big family to eat which was worth it.     They have a gorgeous presentation plating before cooking the meat in front of you. The waiter cooks all your meat for you during the course and comes back after a bit to cook the next meat. The tip was already added in the receipt at the end for the waiter cooking for you. ALL waiters are attentive and your cup of water will never be empty! The only compliment is that I wish we got more rice then little balls. And that I wish they had more side dishes like Tofu hut do.     All in All I think the staffs and food was very professional and great! They had popcorns snack you can eat while waiting for your table as well. I loved the ice cream with the crispy rice cakes at the end too! (Green tea was my favorite!) It's NOT all you can eat but the meat were filling non the less. This was a unique experience for a little change up on things where you get served on and don't need to cook it yourself. I would come back here - but not alone, with a groupie of people again!",

I walked in around 6pm on a Wednesday evening and there was plenty of seating available, both at a table or in a booth. It did not take us long before we were seated. One of servers was already promptly putting the side dishes on the table.  Looking over the menu, there's plenty to choose from. Seeing as there was two of us, the waiter went over the options for the combos. Let me also mention the menu on yelp is a little outdated** (I forgot to get a picture). We went with the small option (for two people) and the first combo which is half marinated and the other half non marinated. The second combo was all non-marinated, and the last combo being all marinated. Be sure to ask them to go over them with you!  The service is absolutely incredible. There was never a time someone didn't come by to flip the meat or see if we needed anything. We received plenty of refills on water and side dishes as needed, and they also changed the grill often. Let me also mention that you can also refill the tofu soup and steamed egg once. The meat was excellent, and the dessert was an excellent ending. I had seen pictures on here but didn't realize it's actually  on the outside of the ice cream sandwich haha. (not sure how to say in english). And yes, the bathroom does have tooth brushes and mouthwash.  TL;DR  Pros: -excellent quality meat -exceptional and attentive service -refill on the steamed egg and tofu soup  Only Con I had was having to ask to get garlic, sesame oil and ssamjang ().  Rommel was our waiter and he was amazing! He was just one of the waiters helping us but overall the most attentive and helpful!",

    "text": "Okay... I really love Korean bbq but it took me forever to try this place because my crew and I have an affinity to AYCE (yes, we are pigs) and this place is not.  But anyway for some odd reason my friends, the hubby, and I decided that it was time to give it a shot. We are big eaters and we came here right after hiking and just accepted that we gonna have to spend a fortune - given it's not AYCE.    We ordered the large family combo.  Aside from the meats, the combo came with one soup, one steamed egg, an order of rice for each person, and dessert.  We also ordered a side of Japchae (not included in the combo).  There were four in our group and the amount of food was surprisingly enough.  I mean, we walked in ready to order 2 large family combos haha. One large combo was enough for  these 4 hungry big-eaters.  The quality of the meat is better than AYCE spots I am used to.  I never thought I would fall in love again but I think I fell in love with the aged beef short ribs.  Banchan was exceptional...loved the salad and whatever that creamy dressing was.  Every time a banchan container was empty, we were offered for more.  We did not feel rushed like the other reviewer did (thank god coz I hate being rushed when I'm eating!) but we also came at around 2pm so it was not busy.  Service was friendly and attentive (no cockiness like another reviewer experienced haha).  The best thing about this place....NO CORKAGE FEE!  Don't get all crazy and bring a bottle of fine whiskey though (like we did haha). Nope...no whiskey folks! The no corkage fee applies to wine only (maybe beer? not sure).  But anyway, we also brought a bottle of Cab and were able to enjoy that.  Oh yeah, one more thing.  They cook your meat for you here...some people like that.  I don't.  I actually like cooking my own meat.  But, I did not mind it this time maybe because I was starving.  I guess I'll have to come here again and see how I would feel about this on my next visit.",

Korean bbq is amazing in its beautiful simplicity and Hobak has mastered it. The decor is cool funky industrial look with lots curiosities to catch your attention and warm your heart. I completely see why it is so highly rated and completely agree.  The little touches show how much they care - there is mouth wash and disposable toothbrushes in the bathrooms and febreeze outside to help remove the smell of smoked meat.  We will be back on our next vegas weekend.",

I said first how many were in the party and got informed to sit down and wait (Like more than half of their tables were empty). After a good 3 minutes we were seated. Ordered the combo menu and waited 20 minutes for it to come out and in the mean time we killed the side dishes. Then we got our steam egg and bean paste soup prior to our beef combo set. Then the server comes and tells us that they are cutting the meat right now and I'd ask how much longer and he said 3 minutes. And of course we waited longer than 3 minutes. They brought more beef brisket (of them apologizing for waiting so long) but it was a waste. We literally couldn't even eat half of them. Their marinated galbi was full of fat. Plus, while eating finally, cashier comes and hands us a bill (like are you serious?) and she said wifi is not stable so we need to pay before it goes down. Ok, but excuse me, apologize and don't force or rush. We lost our appetite. I'm sorry but won't go back again.",

    "text": "First timers here at this restaurant so here's my experience.  We got here around 5pm today (Saturday) and we're seated promptly in the corner of the restaurant for BBQ (directly straight from the entrance on the back right side).  I don't know if something was up with the plumbing but I kept getting whiffs of nasty sewer/bathroom odor.    Our \"first\" server came and asked if we were ready to order food but not drinks and when I started asking for some drinks ( raspberry wine and green tea/water ) he seemed confused about drinks and general and even more confused about them having raspberry wine.  He said he wasn't sure if they had it or not even when I pointed it out on the menu.  After a bit we finally got our drinks but no water ( our metal cups were still upside down on the plates and it's been over 10 minutes at this point ).  Overall this \"first\" server seemed not very attentive and didn't care about us which made me feel a bit heated.  Finally someone with a black shirt ( I think they're busers and white/black button ups are servers )came by and noticed if anyone's gotten water for us and we replied No and he got some right away for us along with some garlic and other sides for the meat which we were thankful for.    \"Second\" server came through and she was asking what we ordered because the \"first\" server moved to another section and she wasn't sure.  We ordered the large beef combo even though it's just me and my gf but we like to eat.  \"Second\" server was nice though she informed us about some of the dishes on the table and ways to eat with the meat.  I'll interject here with the food quality since my post is mostly about service so far, but that's a big portion of my first time experience here.  All the meats were cooked deliciously ( medium rare fans here ). We're picky on brisket cause usually it's too dry but this ones great.  Angus ribs were nice and thick and the skirt steak was really good.  Steamed egg and soup were good too but the meats where it's at and quality wise it's up at the top.  During the whole cooking of meat we had another \"third\" and \"fourth\" server.  Now I don't know if they have some kind of rotation going on cause from \"second\" through \"fourth\" they didn't say anything about the switch but proceeded to continue cooking our meat and making sure to ask how we like it cooked.  It's just weird to me since the \"second\" server made the comment about the \"first\" server moving to another section and not really knowing the order.   Our \"fourth/last\" server was nice I had no personal problem with him.  He finished the last of our meats and asked what flavor we wanted for our dessert.  We asked for green tea and waited for it to come.  10 minutes went by and still no dessert.  \"Fourth\" server came by about 15 minutes in and asked if we got our dessert which we said not yet.  He said he would check up on it and we got it a few minutes later from a buser.  \"Fourth\" server looked like he was running around a lot so I don't really blame him.  Nothing tops \"first\" server dude.  But the gap between main course and dessert was too wide a timeframe to enjoy as a complete meal.  Maybe we got the short end of the straw with our location in the restaurant.  Or just a bad time.  Meat quantity is okay but me and my gf can kill a 3-4 person combo by ourselves and we're not too big.  But quality wise is where it's at.  Left feeling satisfied but not full.  Worth the $90 or so for it?  Not for me but it was a fun experience.  Most the staff was pretty nice and accommodating but I have to take the experience today as a whole.  3 stars ( I've never written a long ass review like this but I really had to get this out.  Thanks for reading through if you did )",

Food was excellent but the host stand ruined the night and didn't really seem to care. Ask for James he was an awesome sever. Hopefully this place does better next time.",

I had heard there are a lot of good Korean restaurants in Vegas, but this place has got to be the best. An old Korean uber driver told me it was legit and my goodness was he right! The price was outstanding for the quality as well. We went during Sunday lunch so luckily no wait, but typically I hear there's at least an hour wait for dinner. A ton of actual Korean people, so you know it's good. Take my word.",

    "text": "First Impression: Hobak is located where it used to be literally a plaza with a whole row of non-occupied, connected plain buildings. Now, you cannot miss this spot driving down Spring Mountain with its little patio and red/white striped awning. The inside is amazing, super unique. You are eating inside but the interior design makes you feel like you are eating outside at a modern Korean marketplace with other seating sections that act as a little shop. Their soda cooler is the 'telephone booth.' Okay, you just have to see this HIP-ness for yourself! The restaurant was less than half full but we still had to wait 10 minutes to get seated for lunch.   Food: FYI, this is not a AYCE. Once we were seated, our table was already set up with all the banchans (7 total) along with our dipping sauces waiting for us to eat away! The banchans were all delicious which is usually rare. My boyfriend and I ordered the Hobak Beef Combo for 2 - $54.99 (Angus Brisket, Angus Ribeye, Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak) with bean paste stew, steamed egg, vegetables and cheddar sauce which was a plenty and enough for dessert in the end! Great food presentation and the meat is definitely great quality compared to all the other KBBQ places in town. I highly recommend the skirt steak as its juicy and full of flavor. The melted cheddar sauce dipped with the meat is to die for. Dessert is included in the combo and you can choose rice pop with vanilla or green tea ice cream. It's similar to an ice cream sandwich with ice cream and a layer of red bean in between rice pops (fluffy cracker like). It's a very interesting taste, nothing I've had before, yet it blends so well together.   Service: Our server was very attentive. They cook all your meat for you which is a plus so you can just enjoy eating. They always come back to cook your next type of meat once they see you've emptied the grill so no awkward wait times deciding if you should cook yourself. They pull their vents downward closer to the grill when cooking so you don't need to worry about being congested in smoke.   The Hobak hype is real! Easily the next favorite KBBQ spot in town. Even though it's not AYCE, the quality you get is worth it. I am a happy returning customer :)",

    "text": "1 star for the hostess horrible decisions and communications. Didn't get to try the food yet.  Got to there place at 8:25. We have a party of 9 (7 adults + 2 kids). Told by the host it would be a 30-40 minute wait. Tey even gave us a buzzer. While waiting we noticed there were lots of small tables and no big table so we told the hostess we are willing to sit at 2 separate tables. Went up to check at 9:35 to see that they sat 6 parties ahead of us, even though we told them we were willing to sit at 2 separate table!  I'm sure the food is amazing with the 5 star reviews so with how much business you get why not invest in training your hostess with better costumer service. Train them on what to do with big parties. Before seating smaller parties ask the big party if they are willing to sit separately. It doesn't take a college degree to know that. Just common sense. Nothing is scarier than a hangry customer. My family are visiting from out of town and leave tomorrow. This was suppose to be a special dinner for the last night,  that's why we chose this place. So disappointed and upset to have our night ruined. 9 hangry customers. Don't wait until your customers are pissed off before you communicate with them. It's too late by then. Invest in a more accurate seating system and train your hostess to communicate! Seating 6 parties ahead of us is unacceptable and pure ignorance.",

Also, my man, Brian, was awesome with the service and the meat cooking. I would definitely come back and recommend this spot to my friends.",

For the the following criteria were all below three stars in my humble POV: over priced meat selections, mediocre meat quality, service, ambience and wait time. The two pros of this establishment were the free slushies and one time use toothbrushes in the women's restroom. Other then that, I would go elsewhere, somewhere that has better meat quality, even if it's a little further AWAY from Spring Mtn., and even if it is a bit in the pricier side.",

Full course with resonable price.   The atmosphere was very very unique and old fashion. I really like. Two thumbs up!!! It feels so warm and enjoyable. Services were great as well.

The food was decent, meat was okay quality, but for only 3 types of meat (we ordered the beef combo), that was supposedly meant to feed 3-4, one person could finish it by them self. Oh and I can't forget, all for $90. They forgot to give us our cheddar cheese dip that was part of the combo and we had to ask numerous times for side dishes that we eventually did not get.  We mentioned multiple times and they still did not apologize or sounded like they cared either.   Good taste or bad, from this terrible experience and poor customer service I would never come back and would advise the same to my friends and family. Do not waste your money or time here.",

Sadly, the boneless short ribs weren't as flavorful as I'd hoped. But I live for the ice cream sandwiches they serve here.  However, their extra amenities are really what put it over the top. Free slushies while you wait, free charging service, and even odor protectors for your clothes. The funniest thing was the bathroom. They have tootbrushes, toothpaste and mouthwash in the bathroom accompanied by a sign that says \"Ladies, he hates bad breath.\"   All in all I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in Las Vegas.",

For some of us, we just want to dive in and cook ourselves.  Korean BBQ place but they didn't have Bulgogi on the menu.  I thought I read the menu wrong and proceeded to order extra meat, and requested Bulgogi.  The girl looked at me with a smirk and said they didn't have Bulgogi like an all you can eat place.  After she walked away and i thought about the comment, i wondered if she just dissed me based on my request.  Overall, not worthy of the Five stars that everyone posted.",

We came here for lunch with a group of 5, the seating was a bit snug for even the large round table.  Once seated, they bring out all the side dish; the kimchee, sales, veggie, etc...sorry I can't seem to name it all, but it was all DELICIOUS!  The menu is very clear to understand and I love the fact they made ordering for groups of ppl easy.  We ordered the large Hobak Family Combo for $89.99 (feeds 3-4ppl).  We did not go hungry for the amount of food in ratio to people.    Now here is the part that I wasn't a fan of...I'm use to going to a Korean BBQ, order my meat, and cooking it on my own time frame, here they cook it for you.  Now with a group of 5 people around a crowded round table where the grill takes up 80% of the table space, to have a server (a 6th person) standing in between you and another person, first, makes it hard to talk to that person next to you, and secondly, it became even more crowded.  So for me, it was a bit annoying, but it's not to discourage other Yelpers from going!  I definitely encourage everyone to go and try it out.  And decide on your own if it's your cup of tea.  It wasn't for me, but I had a great time!  Servers were all friendly and tentative, the food was amazingly delicious, and I definitely love the atmosphere.  The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was having someone cooking the food for me.  But again, this is my personal preference.  I encourage everyone to at least try it once because it was definitely a positive experience.  And I would definitely go back if someone was throwing a party or if I was invited.  I just wouldn't go on my own, only because I prefer to cook my own food.  Overall, it is definitely a great place to check it out and try.  And make your own call...you won't be disappointed!",

She informed us on all of the meats.  Right away I told her I'm a snob in regards to Korean food.  Though the Kalbi marinade is not your traditional Korean marinade it was sweet light tangy and super delish.  The quality of their meat is hands down the best of any Korean restaurant in town.  To be honest however I was not a fan of their kimchi at all but that was not enough to take away any stars.  Each server chipped in helping other servers it was great! Like one big happy family helping wherever they can.   The  ban chan or side dishes , first off their dweanjang soup was so yummy, the bean sprout salad was my Absolute favorite and those  Bucheen Gae pancakes made with potatoes wow those are to die for.  You won't be disappointed eating here as a matter of fact I won't eat at any Korean restaurants in Vegas but Hobak for sure we'll lets just say I will be returning.  Make sure to ask for Andrea she was an absolute delight and the prettiest of all servers !  I love women who are gorgeous and super kind and not in that uber fake way. IJS",

Plenty of side dishes came out. We even got a 10% discount for coming in during lunch. (It wasn't that crowded.) We also got the ice cream...delicious.  It was green tea ice cream sandwiched by rice cracker.  Whenever my family comes back, definitely need to make a stop here to eat again.",

    "text": "BEST KOREAN BBQ IN VEGAS!!   The meats are high quality, juicy, and absolutely delicious. The best (and my most favorite part) is the SERVERS COOK IT FOR YOU at your table!! =D They know exactly how long to cook the meat for the best taste.   We always order the Hobak Family Combo which features a mix of beef and pork. Combo 1 meats are half marinated, half not marinated. Combo 2 meats are not marinated at all (least favorite). And in Combo 3, all meats are marinated. I love Combo 3 but be wary as some options are super spicy like the Spicy Angus Boneless Short Rib. I love it but if you're not a fan of spicy, you can always ask for the non-spicy substitute. There's so much food in addition to the meat like the banchan (kimchee, salad, bean sprouts, kimchee water, Korean pancake, beef stew, steamed egg, etc.) and the dessert. Don't forget to save room for their amazing Rice Pop Ice Cream!   The dining room is so fun! Love the street decor. The bathrooms (1 stall for men and 1 stall for women) have free toothbrushes with toothpaste and mouthwash with funny signs.   They're also great for birthdays. They bring out a huge sparkler on your dessert and sing happy birthday with loud, attention grabbing music.",

If you give them enough time, they'll build an iPhone killer or an luxury car replacement for less.   Hobak, I was told from a local, was the #1 Korean restaurant.  I was expecting something a hit cleaner and better than Ginseng or the holes in the wall, but you get the real deal that is usually only found in the districts of Gangnam or LA.     For the price as well, you can't beat it.  I've been paying for sh*t at these prices, but I'm walking away with so much more. I ordered two meals to go since the quality so much better than what I've been eating for the past 5 days.   It's a bit of a drive from the strip, but damn, it's so well worth it!",

Boyfriend and I ordered Family Combo #3 (Suppose to come with marinated Skirt steak, Spicy Angus Bonless Short ribs, Aged Short ribs, & choice of Grilled spicy pork belly or aged pork rib). The Server told us that they are out of the aged short rib and will replace that will extra marinated skirt steak, we cannot even add money to replace with anything else (which is weird). We also add an order of Jap-Chae (which is a huge disappointment!)  The combo also come bean paste soup, steamed egg, and ice cream. The side dishes were just ok , wasn't a lot of choices, also included a small salad.   The Marinated Skirt steak was the best meat out of the ones we got, but still not amazing. The spicy boneless short rib is very chewy, overly spicy and no other taste at all. The pork belly is just meh, doesn't feel like eating pork belly at all, kinda like stir fried pork slices.  Overall is disappointing and wouldn't come back again since there are other korean BBQ in town.",

Everything is pretty good, the wet aged marinated galbi was probably some of the best kbbq meat Ive had.  they also have the korean shaken lunch boxes which is worth getting (KHD is better).  Obviously has beers and soju to wash all that goodness down.  Each table does have a vent but you will still smell like meat when you are done.  Price seems fair for what you get, and the quality of the ingredients.    One con that I can see: they dont have lettuce wraps, so if you are used to making your own wraps, its not possible here  Definitely worth a trip out from the strip, as with all kbbq places the more the merrier.",

Korean barbecue is prepared at your table. And it is an actual table with a charcoal grill in the middle.   First of all, this place is waaaay off the strip. Don't get nervous. This is the real Las Vegas.   We had a party of 6, and ordered a variety of beef and pork, as well as about 4 pitchers of Asahi. Our server Katie was awesome!  Fun all through all of the courses and excellent with her recommendations.   The meat was amazing. Done to perfection. Savory and spicy. I am in a food coma. I can't write any more. You have to try this place!  And BTW, our bill was $240. For 6 people. In Las Vegas.   Nap time.",

The servers cooked the meat for you. They cooked a small portion of each type of meat well done for my pregnant wife. The meal came with soups to start with. We had our side dishes refilled multiple times. The meats were cooked to perfection. We ended our meal with their cookies and cream ice cream.

Personally, I believe KBBQ should be all-you-can-eat, but I I'm told the a la carte joints have higher quality meats.  Any way, the spread of snacks were pretty good. They had two salads, of which both were tasty because of their dressing. I've always loved the spicy bean sprout salad; I had a bowl to myself. I recall going to other spots with a broader collection of pickled goodies, but it's not that important to me. I did also have the scrambled egg dish, and the zucchini/tofu soup.   Oscar, our hwaro master, was great. I must admit, I did enjoy having our meats cooked so we could focus on chatting. He asked what temperature we liked our beef and took care of the rest. We ordered a large set 3, and all the meats were delicious. Unfortunately, they don't let you substitute meats. I will point out that their spicy marinade was a bit much for my friends. So make sure you can stand the heat before you order.  The combo also included ice cream sandwiches for dessert. The \"bun\" is a rice cracker, which was a great texture for the ice cream. I went with choco mint and cookies and cream; both were excellent.",

All I can really say is \"wow!\" , everything was fantastic! The selection of meats are amazing and the quality is absolutely stupendous! The service was excellent, all the sides and banchan were great. I will absolutely go back every time I am in Vegas and can't wait to try so many more things there! Absolutely recommend!",

The meat sweats were on that night and we loved it! If you're eating here for the first time, make sure you ask them to describe all the side dishes. We were noobs so we didn't know what to do with the sushi rice they gave us that looked like mochi or something you had to cook. We almost grilled it.",

We had to ask for the free side refills as well. They were not good about removing empty containers either. The free sides are very pathetic. I have never been to a Korean restaurant with such a bad selection of free sides. The water refills sometimes comes in a steel container and sometimes in these horrible plastic things that look like someone's cheap used personal water bottle. The quality of the meat is most important, so I still give it 4 stars and it's rare to find  'nice' Korean food servers even if they aren't so good at the service part",

I appreciated that detail. We ordered the small family combo (beef and pork). They advertise that they use Black Angus beef and boy is it good! The beef is very tender and rich. The pork was just as good. One surprise was the cheese that was served with the meat. I had NEVER had melted cheddar cheese with my Korean BBQ. Tip: The cheese is AMAZEBALLS with the spicy pork! I can't forget to mention that the meat is cooked over charcoal grills. The variety of banchan was very good as well: kimchi, pickled bokchoy, pickled daikon, salad and bean sprouts. The combo came with steamed egg, daengjang jjigae and a wonderful (interesting) dessert of sweet bean paste and green tea ice cream between rice cakes. Overall, the experience was great: fun ambience, fresh, high quality ingredients, and great service.",

Food arrived quickly (perhaps to get fast throughput of customers as there is a waiting line for tables). Style seemed traditional and yet different - like serving short rib in \"sushi\" style meaning a piece of rib on a ball of rice with wasabi. We had the beef combo of brisket, rib eye and short rib and they were all tender and full of flavor. I would recommend this place to those in search of Korean BBQ any time. Dessert was included and was delicious served within a Korean style wafer. Overall the meal was good value",

It's a good sign that the food is amazing but it still sucks to wait when I'm HANGRY!   I do like that they give you free slushies as a \"thank you for waiting so long\" - it keeps the kids happy!!  Service is phenomenal and the meat is so freaking amazing!  I absolutely love the brisket on top of the rice balls and dipped in the Hobak sauce!  Oh Hobak Sauce - how I love you!!  I could eat anything and everything soaked in Hobak sauce!  The glass noodle appetizer is my favorite and the potato pancakes are a must for me!  You can't go wrong here!  It's also a great place for a birthday as they turn the music up and bring you a dessert with a sparkler.  The tables are quite small and there isn't much room for your belongings.  I choose to leave my purse at home when we come here.  Beer, wine and Soju are served here - no hard alcohol.  The bathrooms offer free tooth brushes.  Hobak needs to expand or open a second location!",

You definitely are paying for the savory quality and experience . If you're going to go out for Korean bbq, try this unique, hip place. The atmosphere and lighting is perfect for a date, anniversary, or any special occasion with minimal-average noise level. The service is excellent as they provide water bottles outside and free ice slushies to help with the wait. (There seems to always be a wait of about 10-20 minutes-but worth it). If you're new to Korean bbq, this is a practical place to check out because the staff basically checks in periodically and cooks the meat to your liking. Visiting this place is guaranteed to give you an unforgettable korean bbq experience. The portion is fair and will surely have you full. I experienced bbq in S.Korea, and I can say this restaurant definitely does not disappoint my expectation. I would take any of my friends here and recommend it to the avid meat lover. Bbq is cooked over charcoal to guarantee the best taste. Sides and salad are so great to bring out the taste of the soft and tender meat. The dwaenjangjjigae (bean paste stew) And steamed egg I found to be especially delicious and eaten alongside the bbq. You couldn't possibly expect more from a delectable dining experience.",

The food was delicious, the staff was attentive and the atmosphere was so much fun. We got the small #2 family combo for the 3 of us, Which was Angus brisket, premium pork belly, skirt steak, pork jowl and had strawberry ice cream for dessert. It had us stuffed.   It's definitely a place to bring close friends and family (there is a lot of sharing) but I definitely wouldn't bring younger kids. I kept thinking if my 1 year old was there he would try to constantly touch where the food was being cooked.   I'm for sure down to go again, I think it's a great option for a fun night out!

Highly recommend the beef combo with the short ribs and skirt steak, and get extras of the potato pancake (especially when they're hot!). Ask for sesame oil in your salt for the brisket - it's a game changer. Expert tip: after you eat the yummy bits in your soup, spoon the egg into the broth and let it soak up the flavor. Our server Matthew was very attentive and the entire staff will stop to help. If you're in the mood for drinks, can't go wrong with the blue soju.",

I think the best part is the actual flavor and quality of the meat. It's not all you can eat which in my opinion is better so you are paying for quality and receiving quality.  I have been to many other KBBQ in Las Vegas (Gen, Honey Pig, etc.) but Hobak is by far the best.  PS. Denise was awesome as well as all of the other servers!",

The perfect amount of food and didn't overly stuff ourselves and finished with the cookies and cream rice cracker desert.   Very highly recommend because the food was absolutely delicious.

We also ordered Jap Chae which they kept forgetting and finally it came at the end of our meal, which really sucked. This place is my husband's favorite, but I prefer the more traditional Dae Jang Keum (DJK), because I like the traditional side dishes and their jap chae is MUCH better.  Service: this is more service oriented than DJK because they cook the food for you (in front of you on the grill). I don't really like this, but my husband enjoys this level of service.  Ambiance: really cool how it's decorated so that you feel like you're in an outside street scene.  Cost: More expensive than DJK, so we call this the \"fancy BBQ place\".  Bottom line - food is better at DJK, but if you want a higher level of service and nicer environment, then go to Hobak.",

I went around 6:30 on a Thursday evening and we thought there was going to be about an hour wait, but it was only 10 minutes and they got us seated quickly and efficiently. They do not have an all you can eat options, but I was still full from the food we got. We ended up getting brisket, short rib, pork belly, and ribeye. All the meats were delicious and cooked to perfection. My only thing is that because the employees do all of the cooking, it takes away from the KBBQ experience, but that is just a personal preference of mine. Other than that I have nothing else to complain about!",

It came with soup, salad and all kinds of Korean side dishes. I ate too much of the side dishes before the meat came out. Everything was delicious! It said \"for 2 people\" on the menu, but it was enough to feed 3 people. The beef was so tender and the pork was seasoned very well (tasty!). I liked spicy pork with cheese sauce. We couldn't finish everything so we took some home. Plus, I got beef bones Souvenir for my dogs :-) there was a lot of meat around them. They loved it! The waiters and the waitresses that cooked our meat were so nice and attentive.  One hour wait was a little too long for me but I would LOVE to come back here one of these days... P.S. I parked in the mister zone right in front of the entrance door, but my car didn't get wet at all :-)",

A couple unique takes on KBBQ here that sets Hobak apart from other KBBQs were sushi rice/wasabi provided with orders of beef brisket (works surprisingly well), cheese fondue with pork belly, and that rice cracker ice cream sandwich in the end.  Add solid ban chans and this place really stands out above all the other KBBQs I've had including those from Los Angeles (looking at you Kang Ho Dong).    Pros: - sushi rice/wasabi and beef brisket - cheese fondue with pork belly - marinated skirt steak - rice cracker ice cream sandwich - easy parking  Cons: - no wait at lunch - is pricey without a coupon.  Same level as Kang Ho Dong.  Note:   - Came with a $20 off coupon from Christmas special. - Ordered the small combo that says serves 1-2 (easily serves 2-3)",

There were few other KBBQ spots that opened around the same time as Hobak did, but Hobak is not like any other KBBQ spots in town. So they are killing it in KBBQ game in Vegas right now. It's their CHARCOAL FIRE GRILL that sets them aside from any other Korean BBQ places in town.  Their fire will cook your meat just like the  (CHARCOAL FIRE) from Korea. Nice sear on the outside and perfect inside. I have been to too many other KBBQ places where the meat gets cooked to death and I am usually annoyed by that. I love Med-rare meat. Too many KBBQ spots (especially if you let the guests cook their own) seems to torch the F out of the meat.  The servers at Hobak will always make sure your meat is cooked properly. Even the brisket (cha-dol ) is cooked perfectly soft!! & they charge out the grill every time they cook a diff kind of meat.  Oh! And they have some amazing CHEESE CORN (pics) The marinade on their Kalbi is noticeably tastier than other places, and their ribeye is to die for. I can honestly say this place is amazing me of the most LEGIT places in town. Go ask for our fav server Na Na!! Paul & Mindi Ryu",

I had since eaten the meat combo and after eating at other Korean restaurants their beef quality is much better. I would still recommend this place, now since we are becoming more of regulars I wished they would have a local punch card for dining in here and referring friends and family.   Nonetheless, still one of the best Korean restaurants to dine out here.",

    "text": "This was my favorite restaurant. Amazing food and great service. But today they're very busy and service was beyond terrible. The waitress left in the middle of our meal, never to be seen again. We had to fetch multiple others to get some service: more water, bill, to go boxes, dessert. And the expensive meat our waitress was in the process of cooking - burnt.   Then the hostess proposed to charge an 18% gratuity because we're a table of 6. Proceeded to say then that since one of us was a baby, they would waive this rule. When I didn't leave a tip - she asked if I wanted to tip the server, I responded that we didn't get any service, so no. She then reminded me that she didn't charge us 18% gratuity! All of this is after my parents - whom I was treating - walked out.  So I had this conversation while I'm waiting at the register as the hostess ran out of printing paper and didn't know how to replace it with the new roll for a while.   What a disaster.",

Receptionist explained to me that company policy doesn't accept the reservations. I asked 6:00 pm sitting, she told me to come 5:00. No guarantee we will get a table or not, if we are lucky, we have to wait at least 30 minutes. I do not like the company policy and how they conducting their business. Our times are valuable as theirs, so I made a reservation at Magal BBQ. I feel relieved when I hear the pleasant and polite voice of Magal BBQ. I can't wait to try Magal BBQ!!!",

Decor - They try to make it look like you're on the streets of 1950's Korea. It's beautiful at night with all the lights hanging above.  Service - The best part is that they cook it for you. All you have to do is grab the finished meats. They tell you when it's done so there's no guess work. Other places come by every so often and help you, but this one is full service.  Combo - We got their Large family combo for four of us. It's a good selection. The skirt steak was sooooo tender. The short ribs were marinated perfectly and top notch. The grilled spicy pork belly is definitely something I haven't tried at other places. They have a house sauce to dip and also a dry salt/pepper combo that complemented the meats perfectly.  Pro tip, there's a 10% discount on lunch. However, no pretty lights due to the sunlight coming in from the windows.",

She cooked all of our food for us and she didn't check up on us too often, but still checked up enough to not keep us waiting too long. The service was excellent.  The inside looks very Japanese but Korean like mixture of both. It looks like they're trying to put both cultures together. I like to order the first combo it has the best meats. But Like if you order brisket in the combo they give you rice and wasabi and roll it like its sushi.  I love the side dishes they give you, they give you quite a variety. The vegetables are plentiful too. The quality of the meats I HAVE TO say is probably the best SO far but maybe I'm biased haha. The way they serve it too looks very aesthetic.  Now if we wanna talk aesthetic I LOVE the bathroom they have tooth brushes in there if you wanna brush your teeth too! Lol  Definitely have cleanliness down as well it's pretty well maintained.  I also love the steamed egg they give you OMG they make it so good and same with the bean paste soul. Oh and to add they offer this really good dessert after and it comes with the combo and it's pretty good, well worth my money.  I have to give them a 5 stars for over exceeding my standards.",

The beef was okay, the only one I enjoyed was the Aged beef short rib, the others were meh. But the pork is where it's at for the BBQ!! Such delicious meats. Don't forget to ask for sesame oil & ssamjang dip for your pork! For some reason the server didn't serve us the spicy pork belly which comes with our combo.. but it's okay we were stuffed by then anyways. We also got the corn cheese... sooooooo buttery and cheesy. And the dessert was SO good. Simple rice cracker with red bean and ice cream. Second time we came back we just had the pork combo, my favourite!! Wish they had this kind of BBQ back home :(",

I love that they cook for you because I am so lazy to cook. I feel like they also change the grill every time! I also like that they tell you things that you might not know while cooking. It cuts out the awkwardness.  The meats was really good and tasty. The corn and steamed eggs were delicious. My favs at Korean BBQ joints. The skirt steak was even more delicious!

Marinate they used is delicious. Waiters were the ones who grill your food. Meat are tender. Service is a little bit slow maybe because its packed. Soup is ok. Most of the food are very spicy. I hope they have levels of spiciness. Alot of side dishes. Serving is good portion. Japchae is ok, i tasted better japchae in other korean ayce, theres has a lot of black peppers in it  They only have 1 bathroom for each gender. There were 6 ladies waiting and 3 guys on the line. I hope they have bigger bathrooms if you have this busy place  I hope they have seafood or chicken. And maybe AYCE? And better options for desser  Would definitely come back but maybe not willing to wait almost 1 hour  To the person who gave me a tip: i dont appreciate it how you tell me how and where should i eat.",

I had once believed Hobak was the best korean bbq in town, but tonight had proved me wrong. I was at table six, my server was horrible. My server was a short, latino, male. He had i believe three to four table, but had all his attention on the one four top. The table next to our's was also his, but both of our table had to cook and flip our own meat just to prevent it from being burnt. It is not that I feel the need to be lazy to not cook my own food, but my previous visits to this place was excellent serviced by an excellent set of staffs. Our server had to receive help from another server to serve his three to four tables. He would approach our table only to move the meat clamp from one side of the table to another, WHILE the grill was turned to max. I had to check with him for each and everything I had ordered. WOW!! And when our desert was served, it was simply placed on top of another dirty plate, because our table top was full of dirty dishes. When I was checking out I didn't even have enough space to sign the check. WORST DINNING EXPERIENCE I HAD AT HOBAK.",

We ordered two of the #1combo and added a couple orders of the pig belly and fried rice. Except for the rice, all were cooked by the staff at our table. The ventilation was good as we did not smell like smoked meat which was a concern for us. The meat was very fresh looking and the cooked food was good, along with all the side dishes. We also got ice cream sandwiches, which instead of cookies, crispy rice cakes were used for the sandwiches.   There were a number of photographers there taking pictures. As it turns out the owner was there, this is his first US restaurant, there are 8 others in Korea and he and his CFO are like celebrities on Korean TV...very cool! The owner came by for a photo with us. He later sent over some Korean friend chicken to our table and they were delicious!  The restaurant was very clean, and the staff was very attentive.",

    "text": "When my good friends from college (don't make me say how long ago!) came to town I wanted to take them out for dessert... but I also didn't want JUST dessert, I wanted to EAT before dessert. So, I got to work on yelp to find something with good reviews near the place I was taking them for dessert. And that, is how I found Hobak.  I took my sister, boyfriend, my friend, and his wife to eat here that night. It was delicious. We loved it. We asked ourselves, why hadn't we been eating here before? How did we not know? And a short lived infatuation began. My sister and I have eaten here three more times since that first time and the most recent time was two night ago.  We got there around 6pm and were told 30-40... and with the crowd that was there we weren't surprised that it actually went well past that and ended up being closer to 60min. We finally got seated, our waiter was nice, very knowledgable and helpful. We ate our food, we enjoyed it, and then we went home.   Around midnight I woke up with severe sharp pains in my stomach and as I lay there writhing in my bed, arms folded over my stomach... I hear my sister in the bathroom between our rooms violently throwing up. I went to check on her and she was vomiting so forcefully that her face was red and she was out of breath. And so we spent that night and the next day vomiting and having diarrhea. Sore stomach and back muscles as evidence of what we had been through.  The next day, we decided to call Hobak and speak to a manager about our poor experience. We waited for them to open at 11am and called. They said the manager was not in yet but that he would call us when he came in. We left our phone number... and nobody called us back. So we called a few hours later around 2pm, they told us the manager was still not in and that he would be calling us back when he did. We waited until 5-6pm and then I called again. This time the girl I spoke to said that the manager was off and wouldn't be in at all that day... not until the following day, would I like to speak to a head server? But then they couldn't even get a head server to get on the phone because now it as close to dinner time and they were busy. She apologized that nobody told me the manager wasn't going to be working that day but that he would be in the next day and would call me sometime after 2pm.   I just called at 530pm after the manager failed to call me again. That makes call number 4. Why does it take 2 days and four calls to get anyone on the phone? The girl I spoke to said \"He STILL didn't call you?! I am SO sorry...\" UGH. He was in the office and so they said he would call me back... so I hung up for the 4th time without talking to anyone.  The manager, Ryan, did finally call me back after that 4th call. Perhaps noting that my persistence would not dwindle. I spoke to him and told him we had enjoyed eating there multiple times in the past... but that this last experience was upsetting and that the customer response was even worse. He said he was sorry, that he forgot to call me back (but that they HAD told him earlier), and that they didn't serve us bad/expired food on purpose. I said, of course not. I assume that anyone who cares about their customers and business wouldn't do that on purpose... but that something should be done since we had SUCH a poor experience and that it was compounded by poor customer service after four calls and nobody relaying important messages.   Also, just because it wasn't on purpose doesn't mean it was ok for it to happen. That is a playground excuse for children... we still need to make amends when something we did goes wrong or hurts someone (like making them ill). I suggested that they refund the dinner we paid for since we promptly threw it up when we got home. He tried not to say it but he DID say something along the lines of 'proof' that we were sick since giving money back is a sensitive issue. I'm supposed to provide proof that I vomited and had diarrhea? Should I have have taken a video for you? He said he can't refund our money... he has to talk to HIS manager and will call me back.   I would think that anyone with a manager position would have the power to comp a single dinner for two without having to go to the next manager. I am extremely displeased. The manager, Ryan, called me shortly after he contacted his manager who has approved the refund if we can give them our receipt. So they want us to show proof that we ate there now.. which could be difficult because how many of us actually keep receipts from restaurant bills (especially when we don't know we have food poisoning and will need to provide it later as proof). We have to bring the receipt from two nights ago all the way back to the restaurant to prove we ate there because he says they are unable to look through their charges and find our names even when I have narrowed it down to the date (two nights ago) and approximate time. Unreal.",

Our waitress cooked our beef perfectly but she said we could cook it if we want, but we didn't. There was also a good choice of drinks in the restaurant. Always come here if you're craving Korean BBQ.",

They have a lot of items on their menu and even combo items. I had ordered their Hobak Family combo which came with varieties of meat with just the right portions so it wasn't overwhelming. This combo also serves 3 or 4 people. As for dessert, the green tea sandwich was to die for! Their green tea ice cream wasn't too sweet and bitter which is perfect! I would definitely try more items on the menu the next time I come back! :)  The servers that I had were Julie and Cody. They were both very kind, helpful, and tended to us often. We had other servers that would tend to us too which is really good. The service, overall, was excellent during my experience.   I highly recommend this place and ride the hype! I will definitely come back again! :)",

    "text": "Hobak Korean BBQ restaurant serves really great food, delicious, good ambiance, beautiful atmosphere, it has much energy and the decor is not boring. I've been to other korean restaurants in Las Vegas where there's a great vibe, but this one \"Hoback\" has everything I want. I am a \"Las Vegan\". I've been living here for 20+years. I came to top Luxury Dining Restaurants at Wynn/Encore, Bellagio, Cosmo, Caesar...to Casual Dining restaurants like Hoback Korean BBQ. On April 14th, 2018, I had a dinner with my family. It was a Fabulous Dinner, maybe my 15+ times with friends, colleagues, clients...since opening in April 2016. We usually spent $150 and 20% Tips. This time, waiters and waitresses, or servers asked us \"If We would go to Trip Adviser Website and provide rating/feedback then We could have some FREE ice-cream deserts ($5.00) with the condition that We have to show them our rating/feedback on line\". I told them: \"Hey Guys, I don't need your Bullshit desert\".  Here are my points are: 1. Apparently Hoback doesn't like the truth. 2. We have to be 100% honest and sincere. 3. It's a piece of piss. Hoback wants to know what I rate and provide feedback? This is a BS. 4. Don't trust everything you read on Trip Adviser! However, I would rate 5 overall at this  restaurant \"Hoback Korean BBQ\"",

All of the servers were all great and fantastic. Especially BB and Jayden. Their service went above and beyond. Amazing. Jayden was very attentive. We did not have to wait for our server.

Keep in mind this place is not AYCE but the meat here is high quality and the food is delicious. I much rather have quality and feel just satisfied than over stuffing myself at AYCE. THE SHORT RIBS WERE SO FREAKIN GOOD !! My favorite part though was the green tea rice pop at the end which comes in the combo :) Love the ambiance here too. The music they play here is fire !!

Warning: while you're waiting, the smell that permeated throughout the eatery, made it very hard not to want to take food off of someone's table.   We ordered the large combination of beef and pork. I'd stick with only beef for the future as we were not fans of the pork. The side dishes were tasty and had lots of flavor. Jun, our waiter gave us a tour like ride through Korea and it customs and how Koreans eat the way they eat. It was worth the wait and I can't wait to go back again.",

I like that the grill is using coals instead of gas so you get a smiley flavor. Also the waitress cooks your meal for you and when it is done they scoop it to the side of the grill and you can eat it. We did a family style meat combo which included soup, salad, banchan, ice cream sandwiches for desert. The steamed egg was awesome! Nice and fluffy, but we did not get enough rice to eat with the food. The soup almost tasted to me like beef stew. There was a seaweed salad that was good. The other sides were not so great. On to the main event, the meat was delicious, tender, smiley from the coals, and amazingly juicy! We got the family combo #3 which consisted of marinated skirt steak, spicy angus short ribs, aged short ribs, and grilled spicy pork belly. I would have probably needed to eat 3 different meals to get full but I was glad to only have eaten that much or else I wouldn't of been able to drink. If your in Vegas, this is a must come to spot to eat!",

They came out with our sides and then we ordered. Our waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable. It was nice that he cooked our meats for us.  Everything was excellent so far. The food and the service!! He just put our last meat (pork belly) on the fire turned it down low and walked away.  It must have been 5 minutes that passed by and he still didn't come back.  My boyfriend and I was wondering if he was going to come back or not.  He was nowhere in sight.  It started smelling and looking burnt and finally another worker noticed and came over.  She killed the fire and tried calling our waiter over.  Unbelievably his shift ended so he left. I guess there was some sort of bad communication between him and the other employees because we were kinda left there lol.  Of course they apologized about it.  I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for that incident.  Food was great and service was great before our server left us hanging.",

    "text": "Finally getting to try this place after hearing all the hype around it. And I have to admit, the hype is real.   Short Review: Food: 10/10 Probably the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. Service: 10/10 Nih took care of us amazingly.  Atmosphere: 8/10 Very nice restaurant. Better than most places.  Long Review: My parents and my girlfriend arrived at about 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. We were expecting a wait, but thankfully there was none. We were sat down immediately and took a look at the menu. We settled for the family combo 2, as we wanted to eat both beef and pork and it seemed like the best middle ground for that. Then sides came out and then the real show began. Nih (I hope I spelled your name right btw, I'm sorry if I didn't) was our server, and truly took care of us amazingly. It was all our first time here so she explained how to eat the sushi rice with the brisket, cooked all of our meat to perfection, and answered any questions we had and got our sides refilled promptly. A+ service.   Now onto the food. The sides were good and plentiful. They refilled the salad pretty frequently considering my mom prefers veggies over meat. They brought out the bean paste soup and steamed egg which were then overshadowed by them bringing out the meat. Family combo 2 came with Brisket, Outside Skirt, Pork Belly, and the choice between Pork Jowl or Neck. Jowl was the obvious choice.   First on the grill was the brisket which was delicious over the wood fire giving it an amazing taste. Nih explained how to eat the sushi rice with the brisket which was very new to me as I've never eaten brisket in this way before. Up next was the skirt steak. She actually cooked it two ways for us as my mother prefers her meat more well than the rest of us. The skirt steak was very good and they grilled it on a wire grill so the char was even more apparent adding that second layer of flavor beyond the usual tasty meat. They also gave us refills on the bean past soup and the steamed egg and continuously topped off our sides. They also have a call button in case you need someone and there's nobody free nearby which is quite convenient.   Finally was the pork belly and the pork jowl. Being pork it takes a little while longer to cook than the beef, but goddamn it was worth it. Usually I prefer beef but both cuts of pork were amazing and even better than the beef. The pork belly got to a perfect crisp on the outside and the jowl stayed nice and tender after cooking. My father preferred the former and my mother the latter and they can be hard to please. By the end of the meal, we were all stuffed. To be honest, none of us were expecting to get full, being used to AYCE levels of food, but somehow they managed to achieve that goal. To be honest we were struggling to finish the last bits of food, but did because of how delicious it was.   Finally was dessert. They told us the flavors and we were just expecting a scoop or two of ice cream but they brought out these ice cream sandwiches with crispy rice crackers, each of them cut into quarters that were still very well sized. My mother does not like sweets, like at all. But she ate 3 of these, that's how good they were. After we got the bill, we realized we paid less here than we do at AYCE places with much less quality. What a deal! They also have complimentary slushy machines for when you wait for a table (which was practically no time for us) or as you leave, which we did haha!   Its a very nice place. The decor is nice, and I dig the re purposed warehouse look. The bathrooms are equipped with disposable toothbrushes, tooth paste, and mouth wash if you so feel the need. Plenty of walking room, some places try to pack too many tables that its a hassle to get around them.  All in all, great place. We'll probably be back for my mother's birthday next month since she wants to come back here already haha. 5/5 stars!",

They kept touching my meat while it's cooking! Mind you, I have come here at least twice a year since they open. Not too many times, but I know I come back because of the quality. This time I wasn't impressed, I don't know if I want to come back anymore. There are so many Korean BBQ places in town that I'm not going to make a special trip.",

    "text": "Hold onto your belongings!  Stopped into Hobak's at about 1 pm on the 16th with my family while visiting out of town for a soccer tournament. My daughter, excited about being able to brush her teeth with the complimentary toothbrush, accidentally left her phone on the vanity.  Two minutes, literally TWO MINUTES later, she went back in and the phone was gone.  Asked the waitstaff and the Manager (Nathan) and nobody had a clue (surprised, not surprised).  Turned on the Find My Phone feature and whoever picked it up, already turned the phone off... how clever.  All day, we're checking the locator and the phone is off.  6:05 pm we check it once again and the phone turned on AT HOBAK's then proceeded across the street to an apartment complex.    I phoned the Manager to let him know that I believed one of his employees may have stolen my daughter's phone and he proceeded to tell me that he asked his entire staff and they all claimed they didn't know anything about the phone.  I tried explaining that the phone went missing at about 2 and turned on again AT HIS RESTAURANT at 6.  He then told me that his lunch staff had already left for the day - when I asked what time they left - he said 6.  Coincidence??? Never resonated with him that maybe, quite possibly, one of his employees took the phone and stashed it until the end of shift. Back and forth, he tells me that A LOT of phones have been reported missing from his establishment in the last several months but none of the employees have ever reported finding them. You don't say?!?!?!   Moral of the story... keep your belongings close and either tucked away or within plain sight.  My daughter's fault for leaving her phone, YES... she's taking full responsibility but $400 in tab and tip later... you'd THINK the staff would help to uphold the reputation of the restaurant... least of all the Manager.",

Price is a little bit high because of the meat's quality, but not too much tasty, kinda bland. Service was really really great, from the owner, managers, servers, and bussers. If you wanna know how careful they are, just go to the restrooms . Hobak was the only restaurant I've seen toothbrush, toothpastes, even period stuffs that you can ask from any waitresses. They prepare a spray bottle outside to help you byebye bbq smells too. I remember they also gave us a $5 dollar discount card in New Year holiday.     The only con is waiting time.  Btw there is a place I feel that they try to copycat Hobak. We was there 3 times though but i dont want to come back there any more.",

They recently started using those pagers so that everyone can stand in their cool misted waiting area outside.   We usually go later at night. They have many different meat combos. We've tried several, but our favorite is the small beef combo. It's $60, easily feeds two, and we usually have leftovers.   You MUST try the spicy angus fried rice. It's the best rice I've ever had. It's weird to rave about rice but trust me. All of the meat they serve is 21 day wet aged. You can't go wrong.   They offer unlimited traditional Korean sides throughout your meal: Salad, soup, kimchi, various marinated vegetables, scallion pancakes etc. Ask for their potato salad! (They don't bring it out normally, but they'll let you have some if you ask, they said it's a staff secret!)  Also, while you're waiting for your table, they always have a cute retro popcorn machine or an ice slushy machine that you can help yourself to for free. But don't fill up on that :-) Enjoy!",

    "text": "Been here at leader once a month. Even though their side dishes were meh....Their meats make up for them and surpluses. The meats are soo juicy and marinated to the right level. Especially the beef. They just melt in your mouth once done.  Service: I Iike how they cook for you so that they make sure the quality is at their hands. But sometimes they get so busy that besides the time they are cooking for you, you get ignored the east of your dining experience( takes forever to refill your side dish, or being you the check, even with the auto-call service buttons.)  But the free water/juice they give you during waiting and the free amities in the bathroom or the free birthday ice creams makes up for that.  So because of what they have to offer, I would def come back again and again.",

Okay first I'll start by saying the pictures I got from this night were blurry because I started getting a little tipsaaay. So I don't have any pictures to share that are worth it! Sorrrry  Well I went here with my coworkers on a Friday night. We called right when they opened and made a reservation, was easy to get a reservation on same day surprisingly, my coworker said they get so busy on weekends.  Anyways it's a cute spot and honestly the best place ever in Las Vegas if you're a fan of kbbq then come here!!!! We ordered two of the $100 packages then came with a bunch of different meats and sides. We got rice cake ice creams for dessert. The servers who cook your food at the table were sooo nice and sweet and I give it to them for dealing with a bunch of buzzed girls asking them allot of questions lol.  Anyways the food is amazing!! We had a few left overs to take home and that was great!   If you're visiting Vegas or living here then stop by this place! It's worth it!!!! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Good for large groups or a 1:1 dining experience. Both visits to Hobak were some of the better Korean BBQ I've had, Las Vegas or otherwise.  Because it's relatively shiny and new, it feels clean. Which is no easy feat in an eatery where there's constantly meat steam floating around and banchan spills at every turn. The menus don't have that restaurant grit and the walls seem to be wiped down on the regular. The OCD in me had to point that part out.  Beyond the cleanliness, it feels like a hipster Korean joint. The servers are all fairly young and hip, they play K-pop on the TV's, lots of yelling and celebrations. This is when going with a group is extra fun.   High quality meats within as well. I'm not a *huge* lover of KBBQ but if I had to eat it, I'd eat it here. But I do like the soju and the beers! Of course, the smell of cooked beef that will linger on your clothes or your hair afterwards.  I'd recommend to a local LV person or a tourist looking to get away from The Strip. It's a fun restaurant with great food and party time atmosphere.",

Plates of spicy potato, greens, all the things ma-ran pickled and topped the table 6-months later.  Everyone had a smile and that's what I needed after a very long day. The signature angus beef was prepared so well by Randy, I didn't realize 2 hours passed while we enjoyed the famous Korean tapas we look forward to.

In Korea the quality steak they serve here would be ridiculously expensive, and they feel the pork belly is up there with some of the best Korea has to offer.  The side dishes (banchan) are awesome, along with the ambiance of the places. From the courtesy ice water bottles outside to the mouth wash and toothpaste in the bathroom I give this place 5-stars and will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!  The packages they have here are a great value as well.  If you're looking for the best KBBQ in vegas, you must come here!  Additionally they say the wait can be up to an hour on some nights so plan accordingly.  The server said unlike other restaurants it's actually faster seating in larger parties bc of the he location is arranged.  Enjoy!",

Although not all you can eat but the portion, especially from the combo, is plenty. I'm a big eater and we couldn't even finish it all n had to take some away, which is also a good thing as AYCE places you can't pack leftovers (or feeling guilty).  Rib eye is awesome, normally I'd go for short rib but everyone commented on how awesome the skirt steak, I went for it and it's superb. Popular so usually a bit of wait, but they have free slushy n bottles of water for you. Ample parking too. Glad I found them and LOVE this place.",

It's not ayce but who needs that with this kind of quality meat and when I say it's a lot of food, it really is. I usually can eat ayce kbbQ for days but I had to call it quits on the 4th meat. The family set comes with skirt steak, kalbi, spicy pork belly, and pork loin I think it was? It also comes with egg soup, bean paste soup, banchan, and dessert. The dessert is sooooo good!! Get the green tea ice cream. This place is similar to Kang Ho Dong but the atmosphere is more hip and trendy and fun to be in. Upbeat music and the decor gives it a fun vibe. Would definitely come back again to try other stuff like their pork and beef set.",

It was more then enough food for the wife and i. Everything was delicious and cooked wonderfully by our tableside cook. Our steak cuts were nicely charred and cooked to a perfect mid rare. The charcoal added a wonderful flavor to the high quality beef. Not only did we get 3 choices of beef and bonchon. But they also brought out some korean miso soup and egg souffle. Everything was delicious and service was very prompt and attentive. I will definitely return to try the pork combo.",

Manager said I still had to pay for the wine because they had to open the bottle. :/  The meat was great. Sides were okay. Should have gotten soju instead. Nice server. Terrible management.",

It's not all you can eat, however they have family combos that come with a lot of food and the sides are unlimited. My personal favorite is the spicy beef that you dip in melted cheese. Talk about a foodgasm. There are also these unique yummy ice cream sandwiches they give for dessert.  The service has always been great every time we've went.

Let's start with the basics:  - The waitstaff: Waitstaff is ultra attentive. I'm talking about drop-your-chopsticks-and-have-a-new-pair-waiting-for-you-before-you-pick-up-the-other-pair attentive. Super friendly!  - The bathrooms: Yep, I'm writing about the bathrooms. I mean, they have disposable toothbrushes for you and mouthwash because everyone comes out of Korean bbq smelling like everything.  The food Hobak Beef Combo: Large for 89.99. Unlimited bean paste stew and steamed egg. Lots of dipping sauces and combinations available Angus brisket: Delicious brisket Chose the Rib Eye: That rib eye looked so beautiful. It tasted so beautiful Chose the Marinated Skirt Steak: This is the definite winner. Highly recommended by the staff. Highly recommended by our party  Hobak Pork Combo: Pork Belly: Delicious pork belly. Can't go wrong here Pork Jowl: Plentiful and nice and chewy Grilled spicy pork belly: Wow  The ice cream sandwich at the end is the kicker, too. Rice cakes as the \"bun\", green tea ice cream + red bean, or vanilla. This place is the jam.",

Hobak was recommended by a friend for the ribeye steak and I had seen another friend check in on fb so naturally when I got hungry this was the spot to go.  Glad they are open until 4 am since I tend to eat into the late hours.  Me and a friend ordered the beef combo for two which included unlimited salad and sides and the following meats: thinly sliced brisket, ribeye steak, and Korean short ribs.  Service was great as the server cooked our meats for us and made sure everything was great.  Cool setup with the ventilation system to keep the bbq smoke out.  The menu is a la carte instead of AYCE but the portions are just right when ordering the combos for 2 or 4 people.  One thing I would like is being to create your own combos of meats.  Will definitely be going back to Hobak!",

The one tall gal (she usually starts off the table) when taking the drink order was so pushy. They must be having a sales contest or just trying to pad the checks. I just asked for a small bottle of chum churum soju because only two were drinking of our four. She's says \"no, you should get the beer-soju special, it's not big. Small, perfect for two\". Kept pressuring so I'm finally like OK! You made your sale! Geez. It was a damn beer tower. You don't even get soju. Or have no idea how much they even put in it if they do. Total rip off. When the bill came it was $39. Wtf? My fault for not asking the price. But when they pressure you in front of your guests, its kind of hard. Whatevs. Just think that's bad business just for short term sales. I will be a long time fif ever) I come back now. I don't like that pressure salesmanship. But I think they'll be fine without me.",

Hobak is korean BBQ place, they use blackangus meat also use both gas & charcoal in one grill. At this place the server grill it for you but you just tell them if you want to grill it yourself. There are 2 different slushy by the front door / cashier table and it is free. You should take avantage of it, so good & so fresh. The host/cashier will sit you, after that your server will put a bottle water & \"bachan\" on your table. So this is how it work, you order your raw meat and you get a lot of \"bachan\" (unlimited side dish). I always order large family combo 3 (the beef & pork combo ; small size = $ 54.99 & large size = $ 89.99) comes with : * vegetables (sweet potato & mushroom),  * 3 different type of beef & 1 spicy pork also  * unlimited \"bachan\" (kimchi, salad, bean sprout, daikon soup, korean pancake, beans soup, steam egg, greens, to dip your meat = cheese ; pickle serrano pepper ; salt pepper, etc * ice cream sandwich ( 2 flavors vanilla & green tea) = rice cracker on the bottom with red bean paste, your choice ice cream, top with rice cracker again.. I love the green tea one YUM YUM (1 flavor ice cream for small size, 2 flavors for big size) I keep bring in different people to eat here and when they come back here, they bring their family & friends. This place always satisfied us, sooooo good!!! they know what they doing the way they marinate or cook the food. The server are so friendly and I am so amazed to see one server can jump from one table to the other table for grill our meats There is no complain at all about the food (5 starts) but Their music always to loud from 4 pm - up (thats why I gave 4 starts). It is really hard to talk with your company when the music to loud. REALLY RECCOMENDED!!! You should try!!",

The servers are also the best as they are attentive and enthusiastic.  Anything that is marinated is great and I prefer the meat options over the pork options. Don't forget the ice cream dessert that is heaven!  There is always a wait time, so if you want to avoid waiting for 30 to 45 minutes, go early or late.",

The location is in Chinatown and has pretty ample parking, though that might change with the popularity of Gabi and it's hidden tea/coffee house a couple doors down.   Nice open layout with tables made for medium or large groups. Very thankful for the vents that can be placed over the grill to avoid an overly smokey atmosphere.  Your best bet is getting one of the packages, we took the one for 4 that was around $100. Good flavors and anything pork is usually a winner for me when it comes to Korean BBQ. The plates before we're good too, lots of flavors to choose from, though I have been to places with more options.  Had a beer and they kept the iced water flowing since things leaned toward the spicy side.  Only been here a couple times, but I'm already a fan, I will be back again.   PS- try the different Soju flavors they have.",

My husband and I ordered a combination of pork and beef dinner which is called the family dinner. I remembered after the 3rd piece of meat that came out I felt so full and we ordered the small. The appetizers that come out are so good! My favorite was the steamed egg and it was cool seeing it bubble. They are quite efficient in changing out the grill plates depending on what your meat is and helping you cook it as well. They go through so many dishes it's amazing how many dishes they have. Back to the meat of the story though, the beef was definitely my favorite whether it was the rib eye or the short rib it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It was tender and flavorful and I just want some right now at 9:30 in the morning. I also ordered the cold noodles which I don't remember the Korean name for it but it was tasty and a great way to pair KBBQ. Service was excellent and for all the meat that we had to cook we were in and out fairly quickly.",

The interior is designed to resemble a night market, and the staff take care of absolutely everything- no overcooked meats when you get engrossed in the conversation, they've got it handled.  Get the party started with a full menu of beers, wines, cocktails, and soju, then decide on your meats and place your order. The fresh butcher counter at the back brings your meat to the table and it's cooked up in front of you. Everyone gets banchan- they weren't the best, but there was a good variety of salad, beansprouts, green onion pancake, hot tofu soup, kimchee, steamed egg, and various marinated veggies.  Meats are ordered in combos or individually- the spicy boneless short ribs were probably my favorite, but only because everything else came out so quickly that I couldn't really keep up. For the most part, everything was good but the beef dishes and marinated meats were best. Dessert is ice cream sandwiches with rice cakes, and though it seemed out of season the pumpkin was my favorite!   Service was polite without being intrusive- Bryan kept up two grills for our group, grabbed miscellaneous things like extra bowls, clean plates, and rice as needed, and paced the food out well. Came here with a group of Yelpers and had a great time, seems like a good place for family gatherings or special occasions.",

Immediately, our waiter asked if we have been to Korean barbecue before. We said \"Yes.\" He immediately said, \"Well, this one is the best in town!\" We did not appreciate his cockiness or arrogance. And, it turned out to be not that great after all.  We got the family combo. We chose the brisket, short ribs & the ribeye. Most of the side dishes had too much sugar or they were too spicy. There were five little balls of rice. We would have appreciated a big bowl of rice. As far as the meat, I think we would've liked cooking it ourselves. It really seemed very rushed, the whole experience was rushed. The waiter was running back-and-forth. Plus, we both agreed that the meat could've used a lot more flavor. It wasn't seasoned at all. There was some salt on the table, but it was in a little tiny bowl. And, we kept on putting either too little or too much. They should keep salt in a normal salt shaker or the kind that you have to twist around in circles. At least very little will come out at a time.  Finally, what seemed to be a very rushed dinner. We got dessert. We got to pick which flavor of ice cream, that was nice. And, it turned out that the dessert was very delicious. It was a puffy rice cake with ice cream inside. That might've been the best part of our dining experience at this establishment. I would not recommend it.",

    "text": "This place is very over priced. I ordered one of the beef combos  it came with brisket, steak and  short rib. I was dissapointed with the lack of ban chan( only pickles beansprouts salad and kimchi, all other places have seven) as well as lack of sauce options (salt and pepper which u have to ask for oil and the pickle juice) I ask for lettuce wraps and barley tea which they didn't have. I'm also dissapointed with the service  not only did they guy not cut off the fat on the steak leaving the outside blackened and the inside raw but I didn't get the soup and steamed egg untill the meal was almost done which i also had to ask for. When I got my bill I was also charged incorrectly. I ended up leaving unsatisfied and still hungry.  For and 85 dollar meal this is definitely not worth it.",

We usually only get the beef combo.  It comes with Brisket. The brisket comes with pieces of rice with with wasabi I know this isn't typical but hey, I LOVE THIS!   Next is the ribeye nice and fatty they'll do a fire show with the rosemary. I ask them to cut up the pieces smaller for my grams who cant chew bigger pieces. We get our meat cooked med. rare.   Then my favorite!! Marinated skirt steak!! I like it cooked medium and it's so flavorful!  The service here has been so nice and fast!!  Only thing I do need to point out!!!! I need to say something about the dental station!!! When toilets flush they spray germs everywhere.....yuck....maybe figure out a way to cover everything up? I dunno  I don't use it but I love the idea.   Keep up the good work Hobak!!!!!!",

We had to wait about 30 mins but honestly it passed by quick. Plus the wait was just a testament of how busy this place was due to how great it was, ha! We were seated and serviced quite quickly. The staff members were friendly and every request we made was quickly executed.   Food - 10/10! We ordered a combo + a side of galbi for our party of 5. This was a lot of food but just enough to have everyone in a comfortable food coma (if that's even possible?). The combo came with steamed egg and soup to start then dessert to end. The dessert included ice cream sandwiches of your choice of flavor - it was SO good! The cookies n cream one was delish.   Back to the main food... meat was very high quality, juicy, and cooked to perfection thanks to the attentive staff. I always judge a kbbq place based on its brisket and Hobak definitely had one of the best briskets I've ever had! It was easy to eat and delicious. The galbi was pretty damn memorable too!  Basically the quality was top notch. Downside is no AYCE but honestly at such great quality youll definitely get your moneys worth of kbbq.",

The menu isn't AYCE, but their portions are pretty generous and the meats are tender and well marinated. I like that the restaurant is clean and well ventilated so you don't have that greasy, bbq meat feeling all over your hair and clothes when you leave. I also love that the services come and cook the meats for you, mostly because I don't like to cook. A big plus is that their restrooms are stocked with mouthwash, toothbrushes and toothpaste! How awesome is that!",

Everytime we go, we always get the beef combo. You can't go wrong from this selection. Even if you choose one thing over the other, it still good!  Normally we go brisket, short ribs and marinated skirt steak. Brisket melts in your mouth! Must dip it in cheese then hobak sauce, a little wasabi over the sushi rice and WHAM! this is foodgasm! Haha   Short ribs are soft AF! Marinated skirt steak, fluffy AF!Fried rice and japchae are amazing as well! Side dishes are hands down yummy!   Celebrate birthdays here!

We had the beef combo and it fed 3 guys and we barely finished it. This is my 2nd time at Hobak and I would say this experience was a lot better, I really do not know why.  The Chinese sushi rice was interesting the way they are rolled up into little balls. Sort of like it, helps me not get so full so fast.  The rice cake ice cream dessert were awesome! We had the strawberry and Oreo cookie flavor.  Great choices of beer and soju, just be careful because the soju is a creeper.  I recommend trying Hobak, definitely a top Korean bbq spot in Las Vegas with great choices of drinks and desserts.",

It was our first time here si we'r didn't know what to expect but my cousin came before so he knew what to get and what he chose was perfect for the 4 of us. There were so many things coming to the table soups salads and dinner other stuff to.  The guys come to your table to cook your meat for you and ask if you need anything else.   I really enjoyed ack the best we had and onions mushrooms. Everything was tasty I'm not sure what style of meat we had for them to prep but it was delicious.  I liked the sauce and the daily for dipping when the meat is finished cooking.   They give you a desseet The end of the meal we chose the vanilla it was delicious I wish I I eat more.

We ordered the family meat special and as always they cook it to your liking. We ha a mix of medium and well. The marinated meat was delicious and juicy. The bi bim bop is served in a tin and hand shaken to mix it up. We also ordered the bean paste soup and fried egg. Enjoy the pics and videos of the wonderful meal we had. The potato cake, Kimchee and salad are some of my favorite bon chon.  In the front they have free popcorn. In the summer I was pretty sure it was free slushees so it's nice to see they change it up. I was also surprised to see in the restroom, a large canister of tooth brushes and bottles of mouth wash in case you wanted to freshen up after your meal.   When you get the family meal, dessert is included and you get to pick two flavors, we had the strawberry and cookies and cream!  Can't wait to come back and again!",

Once you're done eating, you smell like KBBQ, so they have this spray you can put on yourself so you aren't smelly lolol   FOOD 4/5: -NOT AYCE -Me and my boyfriend got the Hobak Family Combo Set 2 ($58.99). It comes with angus brisket + premium pork belly + outside skirt + (premium pork jowl or premium pork necks). We ended up getting the jowl. The small family combos are worth it, the small did fill us both. -My favorites were angus brisket + premium pork belly :) -They have sweet sushi rice + wasabi that you can eat with it, which I thought was super cool and different -Really good side dishes!   DESSERTS 3/5: -The family combos come with ice cream. -The ice cream sandwich isn't a typical ice cream sandwich. They don't use cookies, they use some kind of deep fried batter...not as delicious....  TIPS: -If your feeling KBBQ and you don't care how much your spending. This place is definitely a good place to eat at.",

When they cook raw meat that touched cooked meat it can't be good. Quality of meat is terrible now. A lot of fats that I have to throw away. It is so bland also. It is either no taste or very salty from the marinate. Side dishes are very limited now compared to before. It is also not fresh. Bubbles in the cold soup that lasted the whole duration of the meal, looked like dish wash water that I don't even touch. Overall terrible experience that I felt totally ripped off. I will not return again. They need to remain competitive with quality and value but now it is gone.",

Alot of k pop blaring out the speakers if you like that. The meat is just standard. But mark my words, if you want to enjoy a great time with friends. Then I'll say Hobak. But you go to Goong Korean bbq for quality.",

    "text": "We were invited by a friend to join him at Hobak for dinner.  Another trip up Spring Mountain to experiment with more Asian cuisine.  We arrived at about 7pm and were seated within a few minutes.  If we had arrived 30 minutes later, we would have waited an hour.    The restaurant is open floor seating with the kitchen on the back wall.  You have a good visual of the chefs butchering fresh meat selections of Angus beef and Premium pork to be displayed in the glass case.   Tables are round with a BBQ grill right in the middle of the table.  Most Korean BBQ places I've visited in the past, you cook your own meat.  Not at Hobak!  The waiter cooks all of your meat choices to perfection.  Whatever your choice, they make sure it's cooked to your liking.  The meats come with a large variety of side accompaniments.  Salad, soup, sauces, egg souffle, pickled veggies, to name a few.  Everything is served family style to share.  We indulged in a few bottles of citrus Soju.  Served in a shot glass and compliments the meal flavors perfectly.    Waiters are personable and very attentive. Excellent service.  They all wore name tags that looked like mini-neon glowing signs.  Items on the table was kept fresh and full.  Side dishes were always kept an eye on and replenished as necessary.    The rice cake ice cream dessert was light palate cleanser and perfect end to our meal.     We enjoyed our \"interactive\" dining experience at Hobak.  It was busy during our visit, by not rushed.  Good quality meats and friendly atmosphere.  A huge step above the traditional grill-your-own Korean BBQ!",

They also serve the combos with soup, salad, and a tray of sushi rice. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the sushi rice and ended up eating most of it. You can order more sushi rice or white rice on the side. The soup was really good too, especially since it was freezing outside. They serve alcohol also. We ordered $5 Jameson shots.   My favorite meat was the brisket. Nice and thin. Good quality meat. All the other meats were just okay to me. Nothing else really stood out. The pork jowl needs to be cooked until crispy. At least that's how I like it. The short rib was marinated and is good to eat with rice. Overall, it's an okay place to hit up for kbbq. I don't think I'd wait for it though.",

    "text": "Great midnight snack for people looking for a place around 2:00-3:00 a.m. (but don't get me wrong, I would definitely go during the day). The server explained the menu to me, before I was seated to my table, which actually helped tons when ordering. Drinks were taken, and after food was ordered it didn't take so long to come out (ordered the beef combo). The first meat set was brisket, and I love brisket, however the cook cooked the brisket when the oven top (which is heated by charcoal = amazeballs taste) wasn't so hot, so the brisket ended up being a little dry. My group and I ended up cooking the rest of the meat which was perfect for a group of three, when the server had said it was perfect for two (however I think it just depends on how much a person can eat). Definitely recommend if looking for a new KBBQ place to eat, especially since their grills are charcoal, you get a different meat taste.",

Higher than most AYCE KBBQ places in town which now have just as good, if not better, food and meat. Except this place isn't AYCE and the atmosphere isn't even that great.   What really knocked this to one star was the appalling service. Everything felt rushed. They were checking on us every 3 minutes. They were cooking the next series of meat before we were finished with the first, or even second. They were bringing dessert (which is ice cream) while we were in the middle of the meal. By the time I got to eat it, the ice cream was melted. And then the check out process happened before I even got to the dessert with the pen to sign the receipt.   It was not that busy. I was there with one other person and we are the least picky people. We eat at an average, enjoyable pace. I have no idea why it was so rushed but with this and the prices, I will never come here again and I will not recommended this KBBQ to anyone.",

My husband always has to have japchae and I had the fried rice and between all the dishes on our table that would have been enough, but we also split an entree from the grill (steak), which was delightful, especially with the salt & pepper and the sauce they offer. Don't skip the bok choy - perfection! And please if you don't do anything else, save room for the ice cream. I've never had anything like it and it was amazing (green tea ice cream served in a lightly sweet & crunchy puffed rice sandwich pocket thing?) Idk - just get one. Enjoy!",

I've had excellent servers who have explained everything of the dining experience and others who just come by and cook. The bonchon is some of my favorites, I love the salad dressing and kimchi. Also, the desert ice cream sandwich they give you with your meal is incredible.  If you've never had Korean BBQ and don't want to cook or do all you can eat, I definitely recommend Hobak.",

    "text": "One of the best Korean BBQ places in Vegas! I am not a fan of all you can eat as I feel the quality I Is never good. I would rather order what I want and get better quality meats. This place has dry aged beef and it shows. I don't usually order the combo as I prefer I marinated meats. When the meat quality is good, I marinated really allows the meat taste and quality to shine through. The angus bl short ribs are my absolute favorite. It's the fattest cut of short rib that isn't not marinated. When cooked perfectly it is so juicy and flavorful you don't need any sauce or side dishes to elevate it. It's like the most perfect piece of beef for your taste buds. Our second favorite is the brisket. This is classic thin fatty meat which is perfect for a start esp since there is always a wait. If you are doing pork, we love the jowl. It's chewy amazing pork goodness. The neck and belly are always equally as good but we prefer the jowl for the texture. If you do the pork belly make sure to tell the server that you want it crispy. Its literally like crispy bacon bits then. Two pro tips: if you order the brisket it comes with a complimentary sushi rice platter. Do yourself a favor and try it with a bit of wasabi and two to three slices of brisket. It's amazing! The second is if you order any dishes you get a complimentary steamed egg. I love love this dish and how they don't overpower it with a ton of anchovies like some places do. Instead it is clean pure egg with some scallions steamed in. Yum! And if you happen to order a combo you get complimentary dessert which is their ice cream in between two rice crackers. We love the mint chocolate chip because of the crunch from the rice cracker and chocolate chunks. The best part of this place is the attention to detail and service. The wait staff come around to help you cook the meats perfectly and in the bathroom there is complimentary toothbrush and mouthwash. They even give you 10% if you take an Uber or Lyft to eat. Service, meat quality and taste are all amazing. Every trip to Vegas always starts with a trip here.",

    "text": "After hearing and reading so many good things about Hobak I was finally able to come get this place out. Came here on a Saturday evening for a date night with the hubs. Got there around 7 and the wait was quoted 30-45 min. We probably only waited maybe 20. There is hardly any waiting room inside (l shaped bench that maybe sits 6) and zero standing. But there is plenty of outside seating with two stand heaters and canopies. They even have popcorn for you to pour a cup and snack on while you wait.   We were seating along the wall on a square table and was quickly greeted by one our our many servers. They brought out the banchan (5 or 6) kimchi, creamy dressing salad, spicy bean sprout salad, spicy daikon & some kind of green that I didn't like. The steamed egg & bean paste soup came out next.   We ordered the beef combo for 2 with the ribeye & skirt steak. We also ordered the fried rice (amazing) and the japchae (good but won't order again unless more people in our party).   Even though it is table top cooking the servers do everything except put the food in your mouth. Lol!   The brisket was first and was delicious. This is my favorite to get at any Korean bbq and you could tell the quality was top notch.   The ribeye was huge for two people. It was cooked to a perfect med-rare and was so tender and flavorful.   Finally the skirt steak. It was marinated but not over whelming. It was a little on the sweet side and I didn't care for it that much but the hubs loved it. He said that was his favorite out of the three.   All the combos come with dessert. A rice cake ice cream sandwich with a thin layer of sweet red bean. We chose strawberry and it was the perfect ending to such a great meal.   I will definitely be back again.",

Came in here on a Saturday night the wait for a party of 3 was around 30 minutes wait.   We ordered the large part family combo.  The reason why I gave it a 3 stars is because the lady who were serving us are not attentive enough. Also she rush through cooking our meat. I noticed the pork was very burnt. So I told her I do not want to eat overly burnt food. She said it is normal how they cook the pork like this. I agree that yes the porn have to be 100% cooked but it was soooo burnt that is all dark over the meat. Just backing up with words so that she doesn't have to give us new meat.   Whenever she came to cook the meat it was in such a hurry.... the attitude doesn't seems so friendly as well.   I do enjoy the food I think it is very fresh and the environment is very relaxing.   However this time the server attitude was bad and in a hurry that truly effect the quality of the meat.   I hope management can do something about it so that the next time I am willing to give it another try  One last comment is , is a huge disappointment that they do not have salad that night. This is a huge Downside",

I gets busy as night so either come a little early or be ready to walk a little because parking is tight.   A small combo of any mix is enough food for 3 people. I'm a big fan of pork jowl, samgyeopsal, and kalbi. They also have CORN CHEESE - which is always so key to Korean bbq besides banchan, which is always very good here.   I love the atmosphere. It's got a taste of Korea but more contemporary and kind of reminds me of Kang Ho Dong minus the egg and corn cheese rim!   Combos include a choice of soup between jigaes and a fluffy pot of egg! So good! The sauces are great (add wasabi to the soy based one) and the service to top it off is wonderful!  I love coming here when I can get beat the rush! It's about $20-30 a person for a small combo and a couple of Cass! Can't wait to come back!",

They do cook the food for you but the guy usually has a few tables and he gets so busy and takes a while to get back to your table and they don't really like it when you start cooking your own food or mix the meats together. So you can end up waiting a while for the guy to come back to your table to cook your food sometimes. Also they don't have a lot of the small side dishes like the other AYCE Korean bbq places. They also don't have much seafood there also.  The service wasn't that good. We waited a while for the waiter to come to our table if we needed anything. We did like that it did come with the steam egg and the soup. But we probably won't go there again.",

    "text": "Price and portion size are pretty important to me so non ayce kbbq didn't appeal to me for the longest time, but I eventually came here with a group, and I was impressed. I've been back two more times since the first, and my appreciation for this place grew each time (a visit to 8oz made me appreciate this place even more, but everybody else seems to feel different).   You pay more than you would at all ayce place, but the quality, the flavor, the sides, and the portion size all make it worth it. I have a relatively big appetite, and I've always been satisfied well before dessert arrived at the end of the family combos.    So, yeah, I recommend you go for the family combo. My favorite is combo 3. I like the option for skirt steak because that's not something I usually see offered at the kbbq places I go to. And the spicy Angus short ribs are super tasty. The sweet and spicy is so well balanced - not too sweet with plenty of kick. I've had both the pork ribs and the spicy pork belly. It's hard to choose, but I do love a the occasional crunch of brisket bone you get with the pork rib that you don't often get as frequently with pork belly.   Make sure not to neglect your veggies. They're tasty, but it's easy to forget to give them adequate grill attention when you've got soup, meat, rice (don't forget to ask for some), and banchan to consume as well. Also everybody loves the rice pop ice cream sandwiches. I enjoy them. They're good. I'd throw them a 4/5, but whenever I come with someone their in-the-moment review of them typically feels like a 5/5.    Their service has been good every time I've been there. My only complaint in that department is Halloween. I would prefer they not wear makeup that mimics disfigurement. It didn't stop me from enjoying my meal, but I found it off-putting.   Also, I'm not much of a drinker but their Moscow mule with soju was pretty tasty. I don't know if it's worth the price cuz I'm not much of a drinker, but it was one of the better mules I've had.",

    "text": "Introduction: WOW!  Wow! Wow! And WOW! I can officially say that I now had the BEST Korean BBQ of my lifetime.   I was recommended to this place by numerous customers informing me that Hobak is one of the BEST Korean BBQ restaurant they've ever come to.  I decided to give it a try and the rest was history.  Quality: 5/5 110% OUTSTANDING! We got the beef combos and everything was top quality, including the flavors.  I was informed by our waitress that the beef ribs are actually marinated for two days prior to serving. Which makes it super tender and tasty.  Customer Service: 5/5 AMAZING! From the moment we walked in, to the minute we walked out.  The waiters and waitresses come over to your table and help you cook your meats.  Which I love, in addition, you never have to wait to flag someone down for condiments.  Price: 5/5 It is not a buffet, so once again, it depends on how much you can eat. Personally, we got the beef \"combo for two\" portion and we had leftovers. Which we were allowed to pack it to go.  Most importantly, you don't get nickel and dime to death. For example, unlike my previous non buffet Korean BBQ experience, steam rice are FREE here. In addition, lots of amazing free side dishes. Such as, soups, salad, pancakes (not the kind of pancakes you're thinking of, but super yummy) free desserts etc.  Like I said, in my opinion, super generous for a non buffet place. Love it!  Cleanliness: 5/5 The place was immaculate! Yes, including the restroom, the seating area and the grills as well.    I noticed that there's complimentary toothbrushes (disposable ones), mouthwash and toothpaste in the restroom. So if you are that individual like me, who needs to brush his teeth after every meal, you are in great hands.  Tips: Hobak does not hold back in every way you can imagine.  The atmosphere was awesome, not over crowded, especially during lunch time, which I am surprised with a place this great.  Maybe I was just lucky.    One thing I love more than anything is that they have a vent on each table. Know what that means? You don't have to go home to take a shower after your meal so that you don't stink like a walking BBQ Grill. We will definitely be back.",

This is not like those kbbq restaurants where it's all you can eat and you do it yourself. Expect the waiters and waitresses to constantly be checking up on your food and flipping meat over for you. If you don't like doing anything this is perfect for you. If you like handling your own meat like I do, might take some getting used to haha.   Ordered the family combo one and it came with brisket, super thick pork belly pieces, marinated short rib fingers and some other rib pieces I think? They were all super yummy especially the marinated short rib fingers because it came with some melted cheese mmmm. Pork belly probably was least favorite of the meal just cause they were super thick and got kinda repetitive with the taste but still yummy! Also ordered the buckwheat noodle to have a refreshing taste with the salty meats as well as some tofu soup just cause it was nice and chilly outside.   Compare this to Kang Ho Dong restaurant (if you know what that is) and it's pretty much the same except I like the meat portions and taste here better for the price :) to top it off they give some ice cream sandwiches at the end! Great way to spend Christmas.",

They cooked it for us for the most part. They continuously came to the table to put our meats on the grill. They also continuously filled our side dishes which included kim Chee, pancake, and many other things I can't name. Seriously a complete meal with soup, rice, side veggies, meat and dessert! It was so delicious! My friend recommended this place and we will sure be back! And the combo without all the wine we drank was about $65.00 which is about the price of 2 ayce Korean bbq except for this place has very good quality meats and sides! We went at 5:30pm and it wasnt that busy. By the time we left around 7 ish, it was packed! Every table was taken! Very cool and hip atmosphere with loud music that goes off Every time someone's birthday or anniversary is announced! Love it here! Yummmm!",

    "text": "Currently my favorite KBBQ stop in Las Vegas. While a bunch of them have been popping up in the Las Vegas valley, none can top this place! I've been here multiple times and my experience is always great and consistent.  If you are looking for a cheap, AYCE KBBQ place with average quality meat then look elsewhere. I have yet to find a KBBQ place with the same premium quality meat and price point that Hobak carries.   As you enter in, you are greeted by a host or hostess and depending on the wait, they will seat you right away once your table is ready or give you a pager so that you can wait. Depending on the day and time you go, there can be a wait! I've waited as short as 5 minutes and as long as 45 minutes to an hour. Let me tell you, it is worth the wait! They offer some seating inside, and they've also added a nice roofed seating area outside as well. Right by the door, they usually have some kind of snack or slushy you can indulge on while you wait for your group to be seated. Last time I was here there was self serve pop corn and during warmer months there was self serve slushies.  When I'm dining with a second person, we like to order the Small Hobak Beef Combo. That can typically feed about 2-3 people (your hunger may vary) and as of right now that will cost you $57.99. Without going into a lot of detail, you are given the choice of Angus Brisket and either Angus Boneless Short Rib or Angus Rib Eye, then after you've chosen what you would like with your Brisket, you get to choose Marinated Skirt Steak or Aged short rib. Whichever ones you choose, the quality of the beef is always exceptional.",

    "text": "Seems like this is a fairy new Korean BBQ place! We went on a Wednesday night and there was still a wait if about 20 minutes for 2.  As we got seated, all the side dishes along with a jug of water were set on the table. There was Salad with Sesame Dressing, Green Onion Salad, Pickled Daikon, Spicy Daikon with Jalapenos, Kimchi and Marinated Greens.   We ordered the Hobak family combo for 2 people; Set 1. We asked if rice came with the order and they said yes. Once the meat came out, so did the Bean Soup and Steamed Egg. The whole time we were there, a server was cooking for us. He started with our Angus Brisket. The meat was on the thin side but tasted great! The house made sauce was good too, and the salt on the side helped to change around the flavor. There was also constantly cheese on the grill which we found out towards the end that we can use as a dipping sauce too! Never seen anything like that but it surprisingly tastes pretty good. The pork ribs took a while to cook but it was good. The next were the Spicy Short Ribs which we were told was spicy but I honestly didn't know it would be THAT spicy. We couldn't finish so took it home. Non spicy people, watch out! Last was the Pork Belly, and I can say this Belly was 90% fat. I know there is a certain order for eating meat at Korean BBQ places as they cook for you, but getting Pork Belly last always gets to me since I'm feeling full but still trying to push fat down my throat.   The ball of rice is actually SUSHI RICE with WASABI and we were told towards the end that that was rice for us to eat. So weird.. I was totally expecting a bowl of rice, and not sushi rice..   Dessert was ice cream sandwich and you can choose the flavor. They give you a pretty big portion and it was nice for a change in flavor in your mouth.   The veggies were 2 slices of Potatoes, 2 Slices is Sweet Potatoes, 2 Mushrooms. It would have been nice if there was some lettuce and some garlic.",

I could already sense the positive vibes of the business with how packed the parking was, and with the line almost beginning to form from the inside. It seemed really exciting and alluring.   The decor of this place is reminiscent of an LA Korean bbq establishment I frequent before. The place looked very trendy and the lighting was good.   We were actually seated rather quickly and was placed in a nice part of the restaurant. The service was ok but I was quite disappointed they did not have dishes I thought traditional places would carry. They had No Chicken or Seafood... Ouch!   The prices seemed on the higher side but the flavors were really good. The side dishes were not what I was hoping for while the soups did taste amazing.   Overall, I think this place is ok. Not sure if I would frequent it again as many of my friend do eat chicken and seafood. Foodies, please try it out and see for yourself.",

    "text": "No doubt about it, we love us some Hobak.   This is not an AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant, so the price of a meal at Hobak is higher than those kind of establishments, but the quality of the food is top-notch.  We usually get the Hobak Beef Combo choosing Angus short rib, rib eye, and marinated skirt steak.  The marinated skirt steak is definitely my favorite of the combo and I would be happy eating just that.  The meal comes with lots of banchan plus the rice pop ice cream dessert.  You get plenty of food for two people with the small combo order.  The staff runs around cooking the food for customers so you don't have to worry about anything except eating.  Because this place is so popular, we time our visits accordingly, arriving when they open or before the dinner rush:  getting here before 6pm is usually good unless you have a big party.   It's also a loud and boisterous place with music on blast, so just come here to enjoy the food and save the meaningful conversations for later.",

We got the beef family combo plus the pork belly and a spicy rice side dish.  The meat was good quality.  I was hoping for a little more flavor, but it was still good regardless.

Hobak can get fairly busy so prepare to wait. In comparison to Magal, Hobak charges for rice & has a less variety of food selection. My party had the beef combo for 4, pork combo for 2, green tea/Nutella dessert, mango/plum dessert, corn cheese, peach soju, Asahi draft, & cold unfiltered sake. No regrets for any of the orders. We didn't have to cook at all & I say it's worth the wait. Service is quick. Free slushy & water bottles while you wait & mouthwash & toothbrushes in the restrooms.   Cons- I personally think the corn cheese is overpriced. They should explain each side especially since we had first timers at Korean food .   Other than that, this is definitely a must try for locals AND tourists!",

    "text": "I've heard so much good things about this place and I was really excited to try it today.  I came around 5 or 6 pm with my brother. Walking in, the interior looked pretty nice. I loved the decorations on the wall and it didn't seem like it was too crowded. As we were gonna sit down, there was probably about 4 tables eating in. We ordered the Spicy Angus Fried Rice and Hobak Beef Combo for 2 people that came with: brisket, Angus boneless short rib, and marinated skirt steak. Along with the combo, it came with bean paste soup, steamed egg, side dishes and the little balls of rice sushi things. First off, out of the 3 meats, I liked the brisket the most. However, I didn't think that the quality of the meats were that great. The bean paste soup tasted really good and the steamed egg was average. There wasn't a lot of sides dishes as well which was kind of a bummer since I usually love the sides when eating KBBQ. The little balls of rice sushi was pretty good too, but it kind of sucks since its limited. The spicy Angus fried rice was pretty good if you like spicy. Moving on to service; I understand that it was pretty slow for them BUT I don't think servers should just be standing around talking to each other like that. I noticed how the server would come to our table and then they would walk 2 or 3 steps back. They would be talking to some of the other servers while just staring at us eating and then come back 1 minute later to flip meat and then it would repeat. I'm not sure if that's how they usually do it, but to me it just seemed REALLY awkward having them just stare at me while I eat. The guy who was flipping our meats seemed okay as well. Didn't really seem that friendly or try and strike a conversation, but I guess I can't really blame him since it's not a part of his job I guess. He asked us if we were okay once or twice and told us when the meat was done, but that was all the communication we had between us. After finishing all the meats, a guy came over and said we had dessert that was included in the meal. He told us we had 5 different flavors to choose from and then told us the flavors. However, when he was saying the flavors, he started mumbling and we didn't understand any of it besides \"vanilla.\" Then we asked if he can repeat himself and all he said was \"We only have those 5 flavors.\" He looked a bit annoyed so I didn't bother asking the flavors again so we ended up just getting vanilla. Overall, I've experienced better quality of meats and better service from other places. I honestly think that this place is just okay. Nothing really special about it in my opinion. I'd definitely still prefer going Magal.",

    "text": "Tucked between a nondescript business park and KFC is a brash, vibrant, clean, and delicious KBBQ spot. I was apprehensive at first because it's not all you can eat, but it superseded my expectations in almost every way.   By the time you arrive at your table, there's a vast selection of banchan ready to be consumed. Every one of them is delicious and you will quickly ask for refills. My favorite is the kimchi and this picked bean sprout salad.  Picking a meal is hard but my personal favorite is the 4 course beef dinner. Through out your meal, meats will sashay your way and a server will cook in front of you. Perfect if you're lazy like me and you just wanna sit back and knock back a beer.   After noshing on savory and spicy meats, your taste buds takes a detour and your meal ends with a nice palette cleanser: an pop rice (sp?) ice cream sandwich. I left satisfied and I think my stretch marks grew three sizes that day.",

It's party of 4 for us and we got there around 1830 Wednesday night no problem with parking space and once we got there they have a complimentary slashed drinks by the front door while you wait for your table .  We didn't wait long to be seated.  We got the Hobak Family Combo L good for 3-4 people with the short ribs.  The dishes were amazing.  You do have to pay extra for Japchae and extra rice which is so worth eat.  And the best part of all they cook the meat for you :). Check out the pics that I posted so you guys can see what we had for dinner.  We suggest to come in early because they do gets busy.  Plus the ice cream in the end of the meal was to die for :)",

Everytime I come from out of town, this is a must and my number one recommendation for anybody visiting Vegas. From the moment you enter, you are greeted with an old school Korean ambiance accompanied. The servers are extremely friendly and despite arriving 4 min prior to last call, the servers accommodated and served all our needs. The food is amazing to say the least. Starting with the wide variety of side dishes, we ordered the family feast for two. I have to say that their \"heritage\" pork is the best I have ever tasted. The price and for this quality of food is worth every penny. Hands down the best kbbq restaurant in Vegas that will impress both locals and visitors.",

The atmosphere was really chill and laid back, so we didn't feel awkward for very long.   We went for Valentine's dinner, so there was about a half-hour wait, which was to be expected. We were seated at a round table, in the middle of the restaurant, where they had laid out a whole spread of food to eat while we waited to order. We were offered complimentary plum wine for Valentine's Day by proving we were a couple, kissing on the lips. We ordered the first combo, and it did not disappoint!  We sat back and ate on everything while they cooked the meats right there at our table. The servers were very helpful in explaining what we should eat with each meat. The combo said it was for two people, but it was A LOT. Definitely make sure you go hungry, because you certainly won't leave that way. At the end, they even included the best green tea ice cream sandwich, complimentary.   I am definitely looking forward to going back for more! It seems like a great place to take visiting friends.",

We had two servers were kind of reluctant to help us. They didn't even ask us for drink orders and then they would stop in the middle of cooking to talk to other staff AND their staff would loudly speak into their mics over our table which is kind of irritating and unprofessional. Our servers also didn't cook our meat long enough and said the basically pink colored short ribs were \"ready to eat.\"...luckily we know how to cook meat ourselves so we basically served ourself the second half of our experience. It was a half hour wait (they don't take reservations) on a Friday night. They also have really small tables with barely enough room for everything on the table, but we also had a party of 5. We ordered the beef combo with brisket, ribeye, and short ribs. It came with steamed egg, bean paste soup, potato pancake, and dessert. The positive takeaways from this restaurant was the atmosphere inside the restaurant was really unique, their dessert, and their ribeye. Overall, I would probably not choose to come back here.",

It comes with a soup, various side dishes, about 3 different beefs and 3 different porks. It's such a fun place to go with friends and just hangout/talk.

It was plenty of food for two people!! Quality of the meat was excellent! The aged short rib was my favorite, no sauce needed! Dessert was delicious as well, it's like an ice cream sandwich!

The pork belly which was cooked last was burnt because our server/cook was helping others but but he offered to replace it. My husband tried to figure out how to turn down the flame but couldn't salvage it in time. We declined the offer for replacement because we were full from all the food already.

There were 3 adults and it was more than enough food, we even brought some home. At the end they brought out a delicious ice cream sandwich for everyone at no charge! It was delicious and gluten free so even my husband could eat it. Can't wait to go back!",

It's the best Korean BBQ place I've been to from taste, service, etc the place is on point with everything. We ordered the 2 person Hobak family combo and I ordered additional nangmyun. The nangmyun was soooo refreshing, and I have high standards for it bc my mom makes it the best. The combo comes with ricecake ice cream at the end and it's also a delicious treat! We got the green tea ice cream and it was amazing.  I felt like I was in Korea there at the restaurant, and the food we ordered was more than we could eat, although it's for 2 person family combo... It could have easily served 3 people plenty.  I would definitely come back here and recommend going, especially if you are having a Korean crave.",

Upon walking in the industrial decor is gorgeous and gives you the impression of getting street food. They had free water and **slushies** available - perfect for a hot day!   The sides were plentiful and delicious. I love Korean food and tend to scrutinize the kimchi, and this is hands down the best kimchi I've ever had. We ordered the family package to celebrate my cousin's birthday and got an insane amount of food - all the different cuts of beef and pork you could dream of, veggies, steamed egg, tofu soup (my favorite!!), and more goodies I don't even remember.  Best of all, we didn't cook the food. Our extremely personable servers Jayden and Jiyu not only cooked the food for us, but took the time to explain what each cut was and what condiment went best with each one. They were not only accommodating to our large group, but friendly and funny, too! If the food wasn't already stellar, the service really blew our experience out of the water. The only negative about Hobak is that I don't live close enough to it!",

The banchan is very limited and no effort, and bean sprout with sweet salad dressing is not a salad. They gave a lot of effort for customer service to make up for quality of the meat.",

I take friends from out of town here, and my Mom asked if we could go here for Mother's Day, today!    You're never wrong going with the Family Combo, as they come with a nice stew and egg, along with a selection of meats.  Hobak is unique for me, in that the food is cooked for you.  This frees you up for conversation and drinks!  Most of the angus meat is not marinated and the ones that are, are usually spicy.    The only thing I don't like about this place is that you definitely smell like Korean BBQ after you leave!  There's plenty of parking in the plaza, and the atmosphere is very lively.  There are several TVs playing KPop music videos and KPop songs playing over the speakers.",

We split our party into a few groups so we can order accordingly.   My group of 4 ordered the Family Combo 3 which includes Marinated Skirt Steak, Spicy Angus Boneless Short Rib, Aged Short Ribs, and we chose the Grilled Spicy Pork Belly.  Our combo includes a really good bean paste stew too. Does not seem like a lot food but it is. The four of us was well fed and not bloated full. For dessert, we had rice pop ice cream which was to die for. You had the choice of the following flavors, mint chocolate, chocolate, strawberry, cookie and creams, and vanilla.   I hope everybody will experience the best Hobak has to offer. Whenever my friends and I are in Vegas, we have to come and eat at Hobak. This probably has to be the best Korean BBQ place I have ever been to, hands down! Wished they opened a Hobak in San Jose, CA.",

Potato pancake - we always ask for extras Salad - the dressing is bombbbb BRISKET - we always ask for extra of the sushi rice... because the brisket on sushi rice!? GENIUS. I think I could eat just pure brisket there as its my fave of the meats.  Ice cream rice cake sandwich - comes with the combos. SOOO GOOD and refreshing.   ok.

It would be my favorite place after just one visit.  I would not be surprised if they opened another.  They have a formula for success from my initial visit.  Brought a group of 9 and everyone agreed that this was one of the best KBBQ meals.  The dining room has a modern feel.  With tall thin mobile hoods over the grills.  Clean and spacious.  They did a nice job of making it feel good inside.  The Angus beef was better than anything I have had in L.A.  I not talking AYCE.  I comparing to Kang Ho Dong, Quarters, Parks.  We had a large party of 9 so ordered 2 large beef combo with all four choices.  The ribeye steak was incredibly marbled and flavorful.  We ordered another.  The beef was very high quality.  Marinades added to the flavor instead of over powering the beef.  Side dishes were fresh and quickly refilled.  The beef is cut as ordered and this adds to the fresh taste.  NOTE - It is not uncommon for KBBQ places to open a restaurant with great meat and the quality declines with time.  I hope that is not the case for this place.  I plan on coming back.  Service was quick and attentive.  Requests are quickly radioed by your server and things come out fast.  Like many premium places, they want to cook your meat.   The dessert sealed the deal.  It has a crunchy rice cracker filled with ice cream.  Very light but tasty.  Bathrooms are super clean.  Always a good sign.  They have toothbrushes for you guys on a date.  This was one of the best KBBQ meals that I have had...ever.  It was really that good  Note.  They currently have free corkage for wine.  That is very cool",

We were not disappointed.  Great atmosphere.  Great food. Great experience. Great customer service. We had the large family meal for 4 of us and had leftovers. I even got a free wine drink for Mother's Day... a day early. Definitely recommend.  Definitely go back.",

Me and my family came to the restaurant early in the day for lunch and we're not dissapointed.  This is the best korean bbq spot I have ever been to in the United States. This place was absolutely incredible. Everything from the Banchan to the  to the  was absolutely delicious. There is no better spot in the US to me so far.   The ambience is very good for everybody. People who are not korean will get a nice look into korean culture and feel authentic. Also the Korean natives will get a flash from the past with a decor to match a 1940s korean architecture.   The meat is absolutely incredible. The quality of food is just so good and literally every cut of meat is tender and delicious. I can't describe it more because it was just all so good that's all there is to say.   The service was beyond incredible. The workers pretty much slave over your bbq pit and cook everything for you themselves and are more than willing to oblige any request that you have.   If that isn't enough the food is ridiculously cheap. Me and my party of 5 ordered a meal meant for only 2 ppl and we were so full by the end of the meal. This place is a must go to if you like kbbq. GO EAT HERE   Edit:  Something else worth note they have a nice little freshen up station in the bathrooms that includes mouthwash and toothpaste and lots of disposable toothbrushes. This may sound weird but actually in Korea most people like to brush their teeth after every meal. Also if you're on a date here it definitely doesn't hurt to brush after a meal like that lol.   PEACE",

We usually wait until we go home to Hawaii to visit family to eat Korean food but we don't have any upcoming trips scheduled.  Hobak has been open for only four months and it's pretty easy to find. It's next to KFC near the intersection of Spring Mountain and Jones.  We were greeted promptly upon arrival and seated within 5 minutes. Everyone here is friendly. We decided to order the small family combo because we were just a party of two and we wanted to try both the beef and pork. We were highly impressed with the service and quality of the meats. Everything was so tasty and tender! We left feeling very satisfied and will definitely return! Dessert is included when you order a combo and we had the mango ice cream rice cake sandwich. It did not disappoint!   One of the nice things about dining here is that your server is also your cook. Thank you, Andrea! Everything was excellent!!!",

    "text": "Our friends had just returned from Korea and were raving about the delicious eats available there. One of the Korean barbecue brands back in Korea was Hobak and coincidentally, right after they returned, this chain opened a restaurant in Chinatown. The food and setting really cater to a younger crowd. In fact, stepping into the men's restroom, they offer mouthwash, and are stocked with disposable toothbrushes because as they state on a posted sign: \"Gentleman, she hates bad breath.\" The rest of the decor of the restroom and dining room is reminiscent of old Korea (from what I've seen in Korean movies and dramas). The ambiance, along with the menu, is set up perfectly for a fun, dinner date.   As for the food, they have several individual meats, but also offer set combinations. Unlike many AYCE places, the meat quality here is top notch and very well-marinated. Between the six of us, we ordered a large beef combo and a small pork combo. While the brisket was pretty standard, I loved the short ribs and the skirt steak. These also came with both beef paste stew and steamed egg (both of which, are favorites of mine). The cheddar cheese dip was a nice new touch on Korean BBQ, but the vegetables (a few mushrooms and thinly sliced sweet potatoes) were a bit lackluster. I'm not a huge fan of pork belly so in retrospect, I would've just ordered two beef combos. Best part of all was the rice pop ice cream (with red bean), which came in three flavors, but how could one ever turn down green tea?   Overall, the food was great, and I left satisfied without the feelings of hating myself or of regret (unlike those visceral feelings you get after finishing from AYCE). While it may seem slightly pricier than AYCE, it's actually not if you order a small combo between two people. The quality of meat is better and so was the service. I can finally enjoy great Korean BBQ without having to drive all the way to LA!",

Hostesses were very friendly. Salads, ban chan & all the fixings already at the table when you sit down.   Server promptly greets us and ask for our order. We ordered the small beef combo for 2. It's $54.99. It was more than enough food. We had leftovers.   The servers were all very attentive and friendly. They prefer to do the cooking for you. Each time I tried to cook they're right there taking tongs from me. They are very polite about it. Saying let me take care of that for you. They cook the meats to perfection, how you like it.   By far the best  Korean BBQ we've eaten at so far. It's a little pricey but the quality and service calls for it.   Ambience, decor, service, quality of food all A+!",

After we finished our brisket for about 10mins, she came back and 'passionately' cooked our second meat. She didn't even use the beef fat to pre-oil the grill. She deserves a -5 stars for her service and attitude. However, Another server named Nana came over and asked us how we doing. She cooked our last course of meat and really saved our experience. She is passionate about her job and care for her customers. Definitely deserves a rise if the owner is reading this.",

We were bombarded with appetizers that we had no idea what they were. Our server came by and took our order and we went with the Hobak Beef Combo for two. As soon as our first meat came out another server explained to us what the appetizers were finally. They cook the meats for you in steps so basically since the Combo came with three different meats, they would cook one then bring out the next meat when you were finished with that one. Luckily, they saved the best meat cut for last but all meats we got were just okay, in my opinion. None of the appetizers (out of the MANY) were good with the exception of the steamed egg. They served sushi rice which can be eaten with the meats which made the meats so much better. Came with dessert which was a little lackluster. But that's only because I wasn't a fan of red bean. Also, our main server was awesome, I wish I remembered his name. If it wasn't for him, our visit would not have been redeemable. Super friendly, funny and helpful which made our stay more pleasant.  Oh, I forgot a HUGE detail. We found a cockroach running around on the floor but disappeared before we could inform an employee before our meal. YIKES!",

They've focused on getting away from the large quantity poor quality meat fests of the AYCE joints that crowd Spring Mountain road. Top quality meat, served in appropriate portions where it's all about the quality of the cuts. None of this pre-cut meat sitting in freezers and marinating for days. Everything is freshly prepared when ordered and you can really taste the difference. Even the standards like Kinchee Chigae had high end cuts of beef and pork instead of the normal left over cuts you see everywhere else.   I was also excited to see a new approach to the style and interior design. Gone is the bland, cold Korean BBQ layout that is the same everywhere you go. They seem to be going for a modern twist on the old 70's style BBQ joints in Korea. It's great.   Great BBQ, wonderful atmosphere, good service. I can honestly say we've found our new go-to joint for Korean.",

    "text": "It's difficult to write a review that effectively communicates what an outstanding meal Hobak put on for our group, but I'm going to give it a shot. Hobaks Korean BBQ was an adventure through a culinary wonderland. While we waited, we were able to buy a bottle of Soju which made the slight wait breeze by. Starting the meal with unlimited sides, our party thoroughly enjoyed every morsel, but in particular the bean sprout and green onion salad was exemplary. Then we got to the main event, the fantastic meat. Our server Matthew (do yourself a favor and request him) somehow turned every protein into an experience. He expertly cooked each dish to the requested temperature and was the perfect amount of attentive. We finished the meal with the ice cream uncrustables, the cookies and cream flavor was excellent. Perhaps best of all? The total meal (excluding the soju) was only 30 a person. Vegas is a town that restaurants are becoming an exceedingly important part of the experience. I hope this review helps you to make the right decision about making Hobak a part of your visit to Sin City.",

    "text": "Came here for a family meal and the wait is totally worth it. Fun atmosphere and helpful service. We were in a time crunch and the staff was willing to accommodate by seating 6 of us at a table for a party of five. They informed us that it might be a tight squeeze but we didn't mind. Luckily a table opened up and they seated us at a bigger table.     Nana was our server and she was friendly and helpful. She explained the different types of set meals to us and recommended that we order a large and small for a party of 6. We opted for the large Hoobak family which is a combo of beef and pork and added an Angus beef fried rice and Chapchae. The meat was tender and not over cooked. Great job at the cooking Nana! Thanks for warning us about the peanut sauce pork in case we had food allergy. The skirt steak was a bit on the salty side.     I gave this place a 4 star for food, as it can be more flavorful and a 5 star for service.    I would recommend making reservation  if you have a party of 6 or more.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place one star because the food is great.   I've been here three times but the reason I'm giving one star is because one, you feel so rushed. Every time I've eaten here 5 different servers come up and ask if you're ready to move on to your next meat or if you're ready for the check. Dude, we still have half of the grill full of meat and we're still eating it, not yet. Might just be overstaffed and servers need to find something to do. Second reason, the first time I came here I ordered the Large beef combo that feeds 3-4 people, I believe it's like 94.99 or something around that price range. Anyways, I ordered it with my friends and the meat we got was great but the portions didn't seem like very much. We were ordering soju and drinking so we weren't paying too close attention but for the second meat (angus short ribs or something) that came out we only got 6 pieces. For the large combo? 6 pieces? I didn't think too much of it because it was my first time and wasn't sure how much meat we were supposed to get. Paid and left satisfied.  I came here a second time and again ordered a large beef combo again with my family but this time when we got the second type of meat they gave us double than the first time I came here! Got around 10 pieces.  That means I paid for the large beef combo ($95-$97) the first time and they ripped us off and only gave us the small sized portions ($55)!  I was really bummed out when I realized it eating here the second.The second time the server was like, \"you got the large combo right?\" When giving us the meat. Meaning not all of them know for sure what kind of combo you have so someone could make an honest mistake and not give enough meat / give too much.  Wanted to post this review to make sure people pay attention to the amount of meat they're getting if / when they're getting a combo.  I feel like if you order a combo they should have some type of colored tag on your table or something so the servers and everyone else that works there knows what type of combo you're getting (large or small). Otherwise you might get ripped off.",

    "text": "Two people, ordered the Family Combo #3 (which feeds 2 people) for $54.99. We ate it all and were extra stuffed, so honestly, this could have fed 3-4 people in my opinion. All the meats were super flavorful and so tender. The waiters/waitresses cook and cut the meat for you, so all you have to do is eat :). There's also a button on the table for when you need to order, get the check, or ask for help. They also have vents at each table, so don't worry about leaving out of there smelling like you just left a BBQ pit. At the end, if you ordered the Family Combo, it comes with ice cream sandwiches of your flavor of choice, which I really enjoyed because I love ice cream. I am so glad we came to this place as the last restaurant before leaving Vegas this time. We didn't even have to wait for a table on a Saturday at 1pm (but the place was full, so we just got lucky!) I am DEFINITELY going back and I would recommend this place to anyone who's in town and craving Korean BBQ. One of my best Korean BBQ experiences!",

All marinades on the meats are very flavorful and the sides that are provided are awesome. Only recommendation I feel like I should throw out there is if you are a big eater then treat the 3-4 person combo as just a 3 person. Granted there was a lot of meat but I wish there was just a little bit more meat. Not enough to knock them down a star since it does say 3-4 people plus it would be a shame to knock such a great place for something so silly.",
