I hate I can't remember name but she has curly hair. She made our experience great. It was like she was reading our kids. The food was really good. The chicken I added in my pasta was a little bland but over all the dish was great. We ordered white bean hummus as our appetizer and it was the best hummus I've ever had. For our dinner plates I ordered a pasta dish and added chicken and my husband ordered the other pasta dish that had bacon and he added shrimp. Our wonderful waitress put together a fantastic wine concoction for me after hearing what I liked and it was great! I had 2 glasses. We would definitely recommend and go back when we're in Vegas.",

Hexx is a lot of fun and super lively. The music is pumping and people are having a great time. Definitely check it out and tell Sean and Shannon we say hi :)",

The hostess went out of her way to find the cost of the GIANT Moet bottle of champagne in the front window for my curious young children.   $1,800 by the way!  Our waiter, Sean, was outstanding. When they couldn't find crayons to go with our kids' menus, Sean actually offered to go to the CVS and buy them some!  He explained the menu, brought the food fast, and kept our drinks filled. His assistant, Patrick, was equally as helpful. Will definitely come back!",

We were told by a hostess that the wait would be 25 minutes (even though we were the only party waiting & there were empty small tables outside). My wife then asked another hostess who told her that it would be 15 minutes.  Within 6-7 minutes we were seated at a table on the side of the porch (while the one in the middle was left unoccupied). Do they selectively pick certain patrons for the better seats? Both the server & the food, however, were excellent.  It was relaxing to people-watch while enjoying your food.  Unfortunately, not all the servers & hostesses exhibit a friendly attitude.",

I didn't get to see the bottom of my mimosa glass because I was getting refills so quickly. We sat in the outdoor section where there was a cool mist spraying that had nice cooling effect as it was over a hundred degrees while we ate. Although the temperature was high we were totally comfortable.  Another special thank you to Tracee who was so nice and gave us great service. If you go to Hexx, try sit in Tracee's section and get on those bottomless mimosas.",

I checked groupon and it was still on there!  So i arrived to Hexx.. right on the strip. Nice patio and super clean on the inside. I sat inside because it was hot.   The service was pretty good. My cup of water was never empty and the food didn't take too long  The cinnaroll waffle was really good. Just a tiny bit too sweet but still enjoyable.   The breakfast pizza was really fresh and good. Came with scrambled eggs and different kinds of meat  The french toast was \"ehh\" it wasn't too flavorful. Taste more like regular bread with syrup. But the fresh berries added a kick to it.   Overall I think Hexx had great food. I feel like you get your money worth. The restaurant itself is nice and tje service is good. Not to mention a great deal with the groupon they offer",

The place is very large and on a Saturday morning it was super busy.  Although it was a big noisy, I liked the vibe of the crowd.  We sat at a table that was half in and half outside. Perfect for June.  The server was friendly and attentive.  You must try their fruit plate. It has a large variety of fruit. It was enough for 3 of us to start.  Next, I had steak and eggs. The steak was a petit New York strip. And was cooked perfectly, as were the eggs. The potatoes: delicious, along with a house-made English muffins which was super fluffy.  Other highlight, a actual stack of pancakes- it has been awhile since I have seen a tall stack of pancakes.   Their brunch cocktails should not be missed. They even have fun group drinks, that are ladled out at the table from a copper swan or disco ball.  I am looking forward to my next visit! Do make a reservation at peak times.  .",

The host, our busser Justin Mahar and our server Dan Dixon were all great. Justin was always made sure our table was clear and our waters filled especially on a 112 degree weather. Dan knew everything on the menu, we took his recommendations for appetizers, entrees and desserts; we were not disappointed at all. For apps we ordered the fried calamari and poke, entree my boyfriend ordered the scallops and I ordered the salmon and both entrees just melted in your mouth. We really took our time indulging on it. And for dessert we had the smores semifreddo and the special which was a banana foster their way.   With the banana foster I did enjoy it but not as much as the smores semifreddo just because the bun on the plate was dense, if it was something lighter like a puff pastry I would enjoy it more.   Overall I would definitely visit again. And since dinner was amazing I wonder what their brunch is like. Also ask for Dan and Justin to serve you, pretty funny duo!",

I wish we would have gone for a whole meal instead of a snack.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The service was more like an upscale restaurant.  There was someone constantly filling up my water glass and picking up the small pieces of trash, like the empty sweetener packet and straw wrapper, from my table.  In the same way it had a relaxed feeling.  I was dressed comfortable and casual, as we were walking around the strip prior to this.  I didn't feel underdressed.  Along with the fountains going off, it made a perfect Vegas night. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I ordered a Groupon for 33$ for 50$ worth of food at Hexx kitchen. This is one of the restaurants \"you don't judge a book by its cover\". From the outside it seemed like an average restaurant located near the Paris hotel and the beer park. Going in -the layout, seating were perfect. There was a terrace with heaters but it was too cold to sit outside in Dec.  Food: my friend and I ordered a bunch of appetizers to share instead of a main meal- tapas style.  White bean hummus (3/5) was served a little chilled with pieces of naan like bread-it complimented well with the roasted cauliflower (3/5) that had curry styled spices; the baked spinach dip (3/5) was really nice that came with bagel chips; macaroni and cheese (2/5) a white cheddar based Mac -it lacked salt, but was perfectly cooked; lobster creamed corn (5/5) was by far my most favourite dish- the spice level was perfect with a generous amount of lobster.   For dessert : cake and shake (5/5) this dessert was so pretty! cream cheese mouse with a chocolate milkshake that comes in a cute souvenir mixer. I couldn't finish it- because I was so stuffed. My friend had a vegan based chocolate pudding that she enjoyed.   We has to pack most of our food to go, with so many leftovers!  A big shout out to Moon for his incredible service. He even made sure I has no ice in my water each time. The attention for detail put me in awe and is really what highlights his excellent customer service!   Thank you Hexx Kitchen for a wonderful dining experience!",

    "text": "Honestly I really really wanted to love this place and it did start out great but it slowly went downhill. I probably should have read some of the signs when we first arrived. We went to brunch probably around 9 so we were definitely ahead of the usual brunch crowd yet there was a line out front to see the hostess table. I truly didn't understand why because I saw maybe 8 tables with people. Once I got closer I saw that there were 2 woman at the hostess table and one of them wasn't doing a thing. The one would walk others to their table and this woman would just stand there staring off into space without even acknowledging the next person. It was also strange that everyone before me got seated which was at most 3 tables and I was told it would be a 15 minute wait. Wait for what exactly? I see tons of tables open.   Of course I went with the eggs benedict for brunch. It's pretty much a no brainer that I order that if it's offered. It was by far one of the best eggs benny's I've ever had. It wasn't served on your traditional English muffin, it was served over scalloped potatoes. They were so cheesy and delicious I was sad when I cleared my plate. Full transparency that dish is the only reason I'm even giving this place a 2 star rating. I had also ordered a Bloody Mary with my meal which didn't come till after my food arrived and after I asked about it. Usually not a huge deal for me but given all the other service issues it was just annoying in this case.   So why the 1 star rating without the eggs benedict factored into the equation you ask? Because the service continued to go down hill and just disappoint me. Both my friend and I are huge yelpers and we take a lot of time to write reviews, check in, post photos, etc. We both checked in and asked about the free dessert offer. Even though we had already clearly communicated at the start of the meal that we wanted separate checks we were told it was 1 per table. Had I been someone who rarely even goes on yelp I probably wouldn't have cared but I put a lot of hours into yelp. We are the girls that write not just bad but awesome reviews as well. So I think it was pretty stupid to tell us we had to pick who gets a dessert or share. We are the people getting the word out for you. Sure it may not be great in this case but if you ran a better establishment it could have been a free advertisement for you essentially. And to clarify this review is by no means my way of getting back at them for it either.   By the time I got my dessert we had already asked our waiter for our separate checks 2 times at this point. After the 2nd ask he finally brought a check. One combined check. So we had to ask yet again for a separate check. It was honestly irritating that I even had to ask in the first place. No one should ever assume people are paying together. You should always ask if it's together or separate. I don't care what is more convenient for you. I've worked with food before and I always asked the customer before ringing it up. When the \"separate\" checks arrived it was really just 1 slip with it separated out. So we had to then tell him which card was who's so he could charge our cards correctly.  Honestly no one should have had to deal with the crap we dealt with at this restaurant. While the dish was amazing I don't think I could deal with the service simply to eat it again.",

They were attentive to our needs. But I wish the hostess could be a bit more inviting & friendlier. The encounter I had with the gal working there, was a little stand-offish (she wasn't rude or anything, but just wasn't so approachable) -- on both separate occasion when I visited.   -:::-  FOOD / MENU  -:::-  We purchased a Groupon deal and it was great catch! The menu does  lean toward an upscale-ish feel but yet it's approachable. For what we have tried the food served is fresh and came out in a timely manner. I would definitely return for it is a very walk-able destination on the strip & food here is satisfying.

    "text": "I wanted to say I enjoyed this spot but unfortunately I must say otherwise. I rarely come to Vegas and had noticed this spot on one of my last visits and found a Groupon. First off, we made reservations and were seated close to our time, and luckily for a decent seat outside on the patio. We ordered their steak and eggs, corn beef hash and also one coffee. Now, overall the ambiance was relaxing and nice for a brunch date. Food was decent but I would say I expected better. I would rate a 3/5 for the food. Service was slowwwww and I understand it was the holiday but even so, checking up on water considering it was 105 degree weather and also bc we were outdoors would have been nice.   Then comes the part that's a bit annoying. Now we had a Groupon that couldn't be honored because of the holidays. I noticed on the Groupon it blocked the big mother's/fathers/Easter/Christmas/new year but I didn't notice for 7/4. That being said, we were first told we had to hit exactly $50 to use it. Well, that doesn't make sense because I already paid for the Groupon if I used less it wouldn't make a difference them except for the fact they want you to go over to pay some. At that point we we told The waiter we would pay for a chocolate bar to go over to be able to use it.  Then the manager comes by, first saying his whole reasoning as to why he couldn't honor it. I was Hoping for some management help; considering we explained we were from out of town and leaving and didn't have time to come back the next day to use it as we could have had we stayed longer. Well he says to give him a minute (more like another 10m which wouldn't have been so bad except We were out in the sun, without water, slightly grouchy)   Well he comes back and says he can give us the value $30 of what I paid, but we have to pay the difference. But he asks me To see my Groupon to redeem it. Soooo; wait you can or can't redeem it?? No, he could redeem it he just wouldn't honor it due to it being holiday day. So he would give me the $30 value... but in all honestly, between paying my $30 and the $20 we went over to use our max Groupon. We paid $50 so we had no savings, no other specials for mediocre food and service. I was quite disappointed that he didn't just honor it or in all honesty told us he couldn't do anything and suggest we save it or return it to Groupon for Groupon bucks.   I have done business w Groupon before. So on top of what they made off of us $20, they still received their cut from our Groupon coupon. So either way I felt a little peeved about the whole situation.   It seemed very shady when they still were able to redeem but not honor. Because they will still get paid, and took it but just charged us extra. In all honesty it would have been a better deal to give it to a friend as a gift.   So, probably never going to Come back here bc the service was slow, food was mediocre, management was kind of poor. Left a bad taste in our mouths.",

Wretched service with our waitress having been inattentive and showing no signs of care/customer service skills. Had initially walked in on a slower day saying my pregnant wife was feeling sick and needed water. It took five minutes to get said water on a non-busy day/time. This was made very clear towards the end of our dining experience when we stood to leave and the waitress immediately went to go collect the tip (walked over to our table within 20 seconds or so.)   That being said, the live music was fantastic, with a clear resonating sound. The host was also great, being very considerate of my wife.   Date of dinning: 4/16/19 Time: 9pm or so Waitress: Shorter African American woman, with curly black hair. Thinner build.

The waitress brought water out to us immediately and took our drink orders. I ordered a hot green tea, it comes out with its own little pot which was very convenient so I could refill my own teacup.   For my entree, I ordered the Gravlax Benedict, which comes with house made gravlax (raw salmon in salt, sugar and dill seasoning), english muffin, hollandaise, red onion and potatoes. The salmon was well seasoned, the egg was perfectly poached and the side of potatoes were amazing. The potatoes had a nice crispy burn to the skin, but not overdone where the potatoes were dried out. I was very happy with my order and I left very full. It was just the right amount of food, I didn't feel disgustingly stuffed. At $17, it was a little pricey, but it was a nice brunch with great service so I would say worth the price.  The restaurant is walking distance from the Planet Hollywood Hotel. They have a bottomless mimosas special for $23 that would be a great pregame before going out to party in Vegas :) HEXX was always packed every time I walked by it and I can understand why, I would definitely recommend this spot, especially for brunch :)",

    "text": "We came here for brunch and made a reservation online. turns out that if you want to sit outside, your reservation time is not accurate. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes to sit outside, with no option to request outside seating when reserving online, and sat at the indoor bar while waiting for our table. While at the bar we ordered a \"Farmers market\" bloody Mary and a morango cairpirinha (each$16). The farmers market bloody Mary was extremely tasty and comes highly recommended. However, the caipirinha should only be ordered if you enjoy cachaca and a very strong drink; we did not find it particularly enjoyable as it was not very well muddled.  When we finally did get a table, we ordered one order of bottomless mimosas  ($23)as well as the \"Hexx Benedict\" ($16) \"and the \"Hexx Burger\" ($18). The bottomless mimosas go until 2 pm Monday to Sunday.  The Hexx Benedict were rather bland and under seasoned, although well cooked. The hollandaise was also perfectly done, although also bland. The portion size was small for the price, especially compared to the Hexx burger. We requested the Hexx burger medium rare, and found it to be cooked exactly to order as well as perfectly seasoned. Overall, we would reorder to the Hexx burger over the Hexx benedict, both for taste and portion size.  As far as the atmosphere, this is a great place to have brunch. You have a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit outside. The music selection was electric; a  mix of 90's and 00's pop hits and throwbacks from the 80's. The music sound volume wasn't overly distracting and provided a nice background and atmosphere.   This is a great place to go if you want a great brunch view overlooking the strip and reasonable pricing, although the pricing matches the food quality and requires advanced reservations as well as additional wait time if you want to sit outside.",

We arrived and saw a few open seats on the patio and asked if we could sit there and they were able to get us the perfect people watching spot against the rail. We could see the Bellagio fountains as well! Even with the brisk wind chill the heaters out on the patio were perfect. The bottomless mimosas were great! The waitress even changed my single mimosa to a bottomless mimosa without a fuss when I changed my mind at the last minute. I would definitely recommend this place!",

All the dishes looked great. The dessert was awesome, a peanut butter and chocolate mouse with wine jelly and candies peanuts on top!  It was a lot and it was great. The kids got 15% off at the candy store (attached) with our receipt.    The prices were good for the quality. I didn't think much about it then. It as we continue to eat out in Las Vegas it was actually a good value for good quality.   Would definitely go again and even my 13 said he would go often.",

I'm still working on trying them all, but I definitely have some favorites picked out already.  You can't visit without trying their carrot cake pancakes.  A close second is their cinnamon roll waffles.  If you have less of a sweet tooth, their breakfast pizza is made with a really delicious dough, and it is really filling.  This, hands down, beats any buffet in town.  You'll spend less and will still leave completely stuffed.    I already can't wait to go back again.  On a side note, I didn't try their bloody mary, but we saw one at a neighboring table.  It was the most impressive looking bloody mary I've ever seen.",

Fortunately, the wait was not long for an outdoor seat during weekend brunch. If you choose to sit indoors the windows open up to bring the outdoors inside as well. The ambiance was very casual chic.  Bottomless mimosas were $23 and there was a good selection of brunch items from sweet and savory items such as French toast to benedicts and omelettes. I opted for the veggie omelet. It has spinach, mushrooms, and peppers. There was a good amount of veggies cooked with the egg; however, I wish my omelette was more hot and not room temperature. The side dish of home potatoes was tasty and the seasoning was light. I also tried the Gravlax benedict, and the salmon was fresh. The muffin was not too heavy and they offered strawberry jam on the side which was also fresh.  We were very impressed with how quickly our order came out and the service was good. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. If you request bottled water, a Fiji water bottle comes out with no cap. For some reason they do not let you leave with the cap? I thought that was strange because if you paid for the bottle you should be able to bring it with you.",

The menu has lots of options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests. We tried a sticky bun and shared it among four of us due to the sheer size and richness. The bottomless mimosas were a great value and our waitress never let the glasses go less than half full (or half empty). The fruit platter included more exotic fruit choices and delicious muffins. Our server was super accommodating, easy going and friendly. We recommended HEXX to everyone else in our group that missed breakfast!

The drinks here are amazing and the surf and turf sliders were great, but if you go to the strip often you know the service here usually sucks. Apollo was our server and he was just so personable and attentive and made this visit over the top great. I love a great server and he was amazing.",

    "text": "First, I need to note that the hours posted on Yelp for this place are wrong. I rushed over to make it before they closed, without changing into my stylish night digs and made it there before the posted midnight close- only to learn they were open to 6AM! Anyhow, I was able to get a nice seat outside on the street (kind of elevated). This is inside the Paris resort on the Strip. I ordered a hot chocolate (it was chilly) and two desserts; one to go and one to eat immediately.  When the  chocolate came, it was lukewarm, at best, but it was so tasty that I drank it. When I asked for a second, and noted that the first one was cold, I received a small pot of it. Still no dessert and three cups of chocolate later. When I at last saw my waiter who seemed to disappear, I inquired and it finally came out. I tried the roasted pear panna cotta and got sticky mango rolls to go. The panna cotta was divine! There were cubes of shortbread on top and two biscuit like strips. There were even crumbles of pistachio.  I ate the mango rolls for breakfast and they were amazing, too! They were sprinkled with black sesame seeds and had sweet pieces of mango. The treat was just the right amount of sweet. The bill came and I was actually charged for two chocolates ( I guess I shouldn't have drank the cold one). Whatever, I was hot chocolate wasted and didn't care!",

At first I wasnt thrilled because I wanted to be seated outside, but the inside is so pretty and well lit. The furniture and decor is very fun and inviting.   We ordered french toast, some kind of egg white protein omelette plate and a breakfast hash. My iced coffee glass was constantly being refilled and we were checked on by our server often. Even though we came here on a whim, it wont be the last time we visit! I would like to come back to try their lunch or dinner menus as well.",

I had high hopes for this place when I saw their menu but unfortunately it fell flat for the most part. We ordered the cookies n cream mousse and the sticky bun. Cookies n cream mousse- believe in the hype with their house-made chocolate. Oh, it is so good. Not too cloying and a generous portion as well. Now the sticky bun...just no. The cream on top of it was great but the bun itself was just hard bread that was not warm or toasted. Ironically I thought the sticky bun would be better since it's pretty difficult to mess up but I guess not.  However, I'm certain that any chocolate dessert here would be A1 just based off of the cookies n cream mousse.",

So we decided to grab some food and bottomless mimosas while our room was being prepared and we got seated within 10-15 mins!  We shared a pecan sticky roll to start. So amazing! definitely recommend you start with that! I went with the Meat Omelette I was really impressed with the portion size! Whole omelette, potatoes, and an English muffin! Potatoes have a nice crisp to them and the omelette is loaded with 4 meats (bacon, sausage, chicken and pork).   You absolutely have to get the bottomless mimosas! I mean you're in Vegas why not?? Started feeling really good after just a few and you get them for 2 hours!",

My recommendation to my Yelp colleagues - request to sit on the patio deck overlooking the Strip and people watch with your mimosas.  Food: Breakfast Pizza: I was craving something carb-loaded from a full day at the day club. The first half of the pizza was great - hot, soft pizza crust with the breakfast usual (sausage, bacon, cheese and eggs). Halfway through I was over it as the pizza got cold and chewy.   Steak and Eggs: This is the breakfast of champions if you're hungover and hungry. The Angus NY steak was of sizeable proportions, eggs-however-you-like-it and English muffins. Not too fatty and not well seasoned for a brunch plate.  4 stars for the ambience, location, and crowd. I'll have to pick another item other than the breakfast pizza next time.",

The carrot cake pancakes were unreal but the corn beef hash was not only tiny but also filled with carrots and other ingredients instead of corned beef. And of course we were in Vegas in the strip so the prices are a little inflated but typical of the area. They also had some really good Bloody Marys but beware that the Ultimate is 36 bucks.

Seating flat out sucks... the tables are tiny... I mean really tiny. We had 3 in our party and could barely fit. We were completely crammed in. Also they had one of the patio doors propped open and the cold air was blowing at me and it was freezing.  As for the food... delicious. Definately 5 star. I had the shrimp cocktail appetizer and a new york steak. Deserts are phenominal too! Be prepared to shell out $$$ our bill was almost $300.   The waitress was very nice and always there to help us.",

Brunch was lovely and their desk for endless mimosas looks to be great! The spinach dip was so creamy and lovely to share. The eggs Benedict is different but a nice twist on the classic. It's over scalloped potatoes instead of an English muffin, so worth it! This is a little lighter of a dish than I thought, which was perfect for me.   The fried chicken and waffles was very savory and rich. If you're wanting a heavier style meal I suggest getting that. Every server was quick, helpful, and we never had to wait long for anything.   Lovely place for a good bite to eat.",

    "text": "We tried HEXX on a weekday afternoon hoping to avoid the crowds, which we did. My husband and I both had the Hexx burger, which was really good. He ordered his medium (their default) and I ordered mine well done. Both burgers were cooked exact and even my well done version was moist and flavorful.  The white chocolate bun was a nice sweet touch to the salty (but not overly so) burger. The fries were good but nothing to write home about. I didn't care for the sweet and spicy pickles on the side, but my husband enjoyed them. Our daughter ordered the Mac and cheese with bacon bread crumbs, but got Mac and cheese with bread crumbs. It's too bad the bacon was missing because Mac and cheese wasn't good, and at least bacon would somewhat cover up the very bland and gritty (like the roux wasn't cooked properly) dish. Now, our daughter *is* four, but she is the least picky child ever, and regularly tries and eats things most kids won't.  If she doesn't like the Mac and cheese, there's something wrong with it.  I tried it just to make sure and while I wouldn't call it inedible I *would* call it a complete rip-off, considering it's $8. Skip the Mac and cheese. Dessert was fantastic. We ordered the chocolate cheesecake with popcorn on top and it didn't stand a chance.  The chocolate samples with spell cards were cute, but you REALLY have to be a chocolate purist to enjoy the samples. This is the real deal, so don't go here expecting Hershey, or even Godiva. It's a very pure chocolate. Even the milk chocolate tastes like dark chocolate. Service was satisfactory but not exemplary.  We didn't get offered the dessert menu (which is strange considering that's kind of its thing) and had to ask when the check was brought instead. I don't think we were being rushed out, though. Overall, 4-stars because the burger was really good, but this was probably a one-time visit to the establishment.",

If you choose to dine outside you'll have a lovely view of the Bellagio and the Bellagio fountains but if you dine inside - the interior is decorated so stylishly and chic that you won't be missing out on much if you choose inside over outside. Instead of sitting in a normal dining chair, I sat in a cute, sophisticated-looking couch that made me feel quite posh. I ordered the carrot cake pancakes because where else can you get carrot cake pancakes? They were surprisingly delicious and not overly sweet. Most of the sweetness you get from the cream cheese frosting and the syrup. Oddly enough, the cream cheese frosting and the syrup compliment each other pretty well. The pancakes are HUGE and fluffy - also maintained its moistness from all the carrots. You get a stack of 4 per order but honestly...I was done after 2. While it was good, you get tired of eating the same thing over and over. My friend ordered the brioche french toast with berries and gave it a 7/10.",

We arrived just before 930am, and thats when the line started to get really long.  So get there somewhat early.  I ordered the farmers market bloody mary (ask for the bloody mary menu) and also ordered the chilaquiles and they were delicious, topped with an egg and guacamole.  Possibly a heavy meal for brunch, but great flavors nonetheless.",

    "text": "Due to the Travel Zoo voucher.... this is one of our favorites, BUT I can say that would not be the same if it was not for the discount received from that.     Positives:  They have very good drinks and the food is awesome.  I have not tried anything I have not liked on the menu.  But, overpriced at that.    I have had the short ribs, scallops, veal, fish for entrees all were excellent.    My favorite was the Veal Milanese!  I have had the Brussel sprouts and loved them the first time, didn't love them the second time, so there were some inconsistencies.  The app of garlic bread was excellent.  Spinach Dip, excellent.  We had the ceviche and that is the only item I likely would not get again  They have a good selection of house-made drinks     Negatives:  It is more cumbersome finding the check-in desk, even after eating here 3 times, I always forget, you have to walk thru the restaurant to get to the check-in desk.  The other thing is, last time I was there they seated us relatively close to an open door and it was FREEZING.  Even our waitress had to put in her jacket, which takes away from the enjoyment and the vibe.   They should have at minimum offered to move us, or something.  It was not just obvious to us, even though we did comment on it and asked if the doors could be shut.  Even after getting 45% off from the Travel zoo deal, I ended up still having a bill of $300 for 4 of us.(after tip)  Which means, this meal was a $550 meal for 4 people.   We will only be back IF we get a deal.  It just was not worth $135+ per person. I think it would have maybe been worth $75/pp.",

From light to hearty, you'll find your tastes & preferences available.  For me, today was a light iced green (so refreshing!) and a nice steak & egg combo with smashed Yukon potatoes and English muffin.  Steak was cooked perfect and seasoned well. Who needs ketchup when it's already perfectly delicious.  The English muffin warm & soft to tear a part and dip it into raspberry jelly.   The smashed potatoes were a delightful surprise. It was crusty & crunchy and yet simply smooth and soft inside.   This was a plate of fun and delicious contrast.   I also enjoyed a great conversation with my waitress who is a local and it really made my experience even better.  It was a nice breezy morning but the food was the attraction - hopefully, you'll think so too.  :)",

    "text": "\"Cute place!\" As my girlfriend would describe it. I'm not going to lie, it was a nice looking restaurant/bar. Located right on the strip of Vegas, and right across the Bellagio so you can get food and a water show. We stopped by after doing a little bit of gambling in the Paris Hotel/casino. Service was friendly and attentive, for the most part.   For drinks, I wanted the barrel-aged cocktail (their version of the classic old fashioned) but was shunned because they ran out? So I ordered Hexx Fusion. It was good but didn't blow me away. Kind of a rendition of a whiskey sour but with rum. To add insult to injury, the lady got the Roman Bloody Mary, but our server failed to mention that they were out of pickled veggies and spicy vodka. Instead, he just brought out a substitute and didn't mention anything until she said something and then he said they ran out of both the spicy vodka and pickled veggies. Bummer. He did bring out some more hot/mary sauce to enhance the drink...  For food, we shared the Seafood on Ice plateau. Perfect amount of food to split between the two of us. Our version (I say this because I notice the menu changes) came with a split of king crab leg (yummy), shrimp ceviche (yummy), tuna poke, scallop salad, 2 lobster tails and about 4 jumbo shrimp. Everything tasted fresh and was delicious. The weakest link had to be the scallops. Although good, the cream sauce it was in wasn't too appealing to us but I devoured the scallops anyway! (I left behind the sauce). I peaked at other patrons orders out of curiosity and the food looked tasty.   Overall, a nice visit and a well put together restaurant with nice decor and friendly, attentive service. Other than \"running\" out of certain liquors/cocktails, I'd recommend this place.",

Lots of seating available, try to snatch one in the outdoor patio because it has a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Hexx Benedict:  Instead of an English muffin, they use scallop potatoes as their base which I thought was a great idea.  Only 1 serving instead of 2 but it was surprisingly filling nonetheless.  I enjoyed their hollandaise sauce. Farm Fresh Eggs:  Very filling entree with eggs, bacon, home fries, & English muffin.  All good! Strawberry Cocktail:  Very taste & strong.

Her manager made a few recommendations regarding drinks and we loved all of them! We are visiting the first week of June and we will be asking for Denise again!

Our server, Johanna, was constantly checking in to our table and making sure our drinks were always full. The food was beautifully prepared and wonderfully portioned for the price. Even after our check had been paid she still came and waited our table with no change in the quality of the service. This is a place I highly recommend, and one that I plan on coming back to in the near future.",

The number 1 word tossed around throughout our meal was FLAVOR. The flavors were just spectacular and we noticed after our meal that the tables lacked seasoning and condiments, which we know means you don't need them! I mean even down to the French fries! They were truffle or garlic and came with this incredible mayo. Delicious. My friends dad, who has a degree in culinary, was raving about the veal he ordered. The buffalo calamari was delicious as well. I wish I could've tried more!   The only downside I had was that menu was limited. The sandwiches and burgers were only offered at lunch and I was hoping to order the veggie burger. So for somebody who doesn't eat meat and can't have too much dairy I felt somewhat limited which is why I chose calamari and French fries. But it tasted delicious and filled me up so it wasn't a complete let down.   Thank you so much for your service HEXX!",

It was so full of flavor it was crazy! I had the lobster roll, and in the past I haven't really been a fan of lobster at all but I decided to give this a go. It was soft, juicy, and absolutely perfect. Now I know why people love lobster! And the panna cotta dessert? Forget about it! It's a must have! Everything they did, they did RIGHT! The food is 100% worth the price. You can taste the quality! Our waitress Stephanie was such a delight as well. So sweet and nice. Can't wait to come back!",

I wish I ordered them instead of him because I kept sneaking bites of his food :P  The waffles have pieces of bacon in the batter and the syrup has bourbon.  Bacon and bourbon...how could you go wrong?!  If I ever go back to Vegas this will be my first stop for breakfast.   I ordered the steak and eggs which was really good too.  The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is because I ordered my steak medium rare and it wasn't pink at all.  I never send food back but for the price of the steak I want it cooked properly.  When our waiter brought out my second steak is was much better.  Also the breakfast potatoes were perfectly crisp and my eggs were perfectly poached.   This restaurant just opened last week so there are minor quirks but I suggest you give it a chance.  Don't forget to order the amazing chicken and waffles :)",

It is however still running along the same concept of Sugar Factory, but instead of candy it looks like its gearing more towards a chocolate theme. The entire restaurant accents brown and white colors, and also has it's own store with candy and chocolates.   I ordered their signature burger which comes with a white chocolate bun, but its not covered in chocolate, it's a very subtle flavor, however i myself do not like sweet and salty together so i was not very fond of the burger. My friends had a chicken paella, and a grilled cheese sandwich with turkey in the middle. The paella was good, the turkey grilled cheese sandwich was good too but the bread was really hard and difficult to bite. We also got some mac n cheese bites. They were good but the marinara sauce it was served with was cold.",

Kudos to them, and the management.  The food was somewhat disappointing - not terrible, but not great either. I had roasted Brussels sprouts, which were fine, and calamari, which was brought to the table just warm (deep-fried foods should always be piping hot), and dressed in an overwhelming sauce - not the subtle sort of flavoring or careful preparation I hoped for.   Additionally, it was very loud in the dining room. Our server stated that it was due to all the windows being closed. The view of the fountains is a nice feature of the place. Perhaps it is a place to visit in the summer.   Finally, I question the $$ rating - it at least borders on, if not qualifies for, $$$.",

Well let me say the food was good but didn't like the cocktails(Hexx fusion & Raspberry fizz) both tasted awful. If I could describe they had a candle like taste. We ordered  garlic bread, spinach dip, New York strip, rib eye, and 2 cheesecakes. All was included in TZ deal and only addl item was risotto, $10. Well when the billed came out it was for $40. I was like wtf. Called the mgr over and he started explaining they discounted the TZ deal but the balance was still due, stating gratuity. Politely told him to remove the addl charges & gratuity is to my discretion. Then he stated the extra charges were taxes & some other fees. Needless to say I had him remove most the of charges and felt like he was not honoring the deal properly. I will NOT go back  because felt the mgr was being dishonest",

She is a medically retired marine and has paperwork for her service animal. Her service animal is also a three pound small dog who by no means was growling, barking, or otherwise causing a disturbance. She is trained to remain silent and assist when needed. Ari Stotland, the restaurant manager, handled the situation poorly. He approached us saying that having the dog laying next to her owner at our personal dining table was not accepted. We politely explained that under the ADA, it is unlawful to discriminate against people with disabilities and their registered service animals. He became verbally aggressive, repeating that we had to leave. We will be filing a claim against HEXX and the incompetent manager. Never returning.",

You can watch the Bellagio fountains while you eat as well. The chocolate bars are amazing and unique. I would definitely recommend Hexx the next time you're in Las Vegas.",

Ordered crab cakes (mostly crab meat) , salmon (crispy outside and very moist inside) and a infused cocktail with rum, pineapple and brown sugar .... everything was Fire!! Food was better than most the 5 star restaurants we have eaten at in Vegas, and still not too busy yet as the word is still not out about this secret Gem........ Good for us  We sat at the bar and the two bar tenders were fantastic as well, thank you Jarred ad Eric for the Great service and recommendations we will defiantly make this a must stop every trip in Vegas!!",

    "text": "Went on a Saturday morning, place was full of people. Our wait for 3 people was about 30 mins but they do offer to text you when your table is ready! You can make reservations ahead of time and there is also the option to wait at the bars within (although those are crowded too). We were seated to the left of the check in counter and was probably by far the BEST seating in the spot. At first, you think its going to be a very fancy brunch spot due to the set up, decor and the people in the front are very dressed up with prime make up. We then start noticing alot of the waiters/bussers are in jeans and band t shirts. The area we were seated at a live DJ who kept the energy high the entire 2 hours we were there - not only would he shout out the bachlorette parties, birthdays... he'd also shout out those that it wasnt their bday and were just there for a good time! Room ranged from kids to older families and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The bottomless mimosas for $24!! Their giant bloody mary for $25 comes with crab legs! WHAT. Our waiter and busser, APOLLO and ERIK, were the best! Super friendly, chatty and very quick with refilling our mimosas. TRACEY had the entire room dancing, singing and doing the wave. She was great too!   The price was high but 100% worth the experience. Sit in the room with the DJ!! If you love to people watch, there's lots going on.  Right across from the Bellagio fountains, you can even hear them start.  I've definitely told everyone about this spot and i've only been home for 2 days. You'll see me there again!",

She was spot on and had us giggling during our incredible meal.    What a pleasure to meet such an enthusiastic person who loves her job which is proven in the service she extended.

Only 1 greeted us and why she was talking to us she kept on cleaning the counter and didn't look up to talk to us.  We sat down, I understand that they are super busy, but our server never came over for over ten minutes.  Finally another employee came over and filled our waters and then we waited another 10 minutes and still no server came over.   We finally got up and walked out because there is no way I am going to pay 20$ for a burger and not get at least decent service.  I have no idea how long we would have waited if we stayed.  They need to put more servers on or at least make those hosts help the servers out.   Maybe it was a bad day but I won't be trying my luck here again.  Too many other places to eat on the strip that we would get better service at.",

    "text": "Hexx, I was giving you 3 stars but as I write this it's changed to 2. Why? Because your food is good but your help/service is horrendous. We came here twice. The first day there was no issue sitting 4 of us and the waitress was prompt and helpful. Despite the flubs along the way (omelet was completely incorrect, silverware dropped on feet, etc...) the issues were corrected immediately. Day 2, we (2 of us) arrived early and asked for a table for 6. \"No problem\" the girl says. \"We'll seat you right away\" she says. Then, instead of seating us so we can order some Bloody Mary's while we wait for the other 4 that are on their way, she says we have to wait till everyone is present. I say they went to Starbucks real quick and she says \"no outside drinks\". WTF? I'm thinking, should we even come here? The rest of my party shows up about 10min later and the girl says \"I can seat you once they finish their coffees\". How ridiculous. She wasn't even polite or courteous about it. She was really quite bitchy! So you've been holding a table for 6 for 15min meanwhile you've inconvenienced me by having me stand in a god damn lobby waiting like punishment for not having all 6 with me right away. Then when they show you make us wait longer because somehow Starbucks is shunned by your establishment. You're kidding me... you could have made a 4 drink profit by sitting us and letting us wait comfortably. Instead we stood and waited and then my friends had to throw away their Starbucks just to be seated to eat. Not only did your shitty hostesses attitude suck (she was short, unfriendly, curt, not accommodating or courteous), frankly so do you! Im not interested in coming back here for a 3rd try, despite the fact the food was good. Good service can trump mediocre food, never the other way around.",

I decided to still try this place out despite them, due to the simple fact that I LOVE the sugar factory. Well, I was disappointed because this place does not compare to the sugar factory in any aspects.  After being seated my waitress set menus on the table and walked away before greeting us. She then grabbed our wine glasses (before asking if we wanted any wine) and replaced them with small water glasses. At this point she still did not say anything to us. Serval minutes later she finally approached us and asked if we were ready to order and never offered us drinks. Throughout the entire meal she wanted very little to do with us. She would set down our food while turning her head and leaving before we could talk.  The menu is much smaller, less variety, and their dessert menu is very poor. The food is overpriced, I could barely get anyone to give me service, talk to me, or even look at me for that matter. The view of the water show is gorgeous, but not worth it. The interior is also a failed attempt to look classy; mismatched furniture and decor. I also sat in a wicker chair, more proof that this place is a failed 5-star attempt. I do not plan on returning.",

Unfortunately I was really disappointed with my visit.  I ordered the soft pretzels, club salad, and a diet soda running me $34 plus tip.  The pretzels were tough on the end, like leather.  Aunt Annie's has better.  The salad which said had turkey must have been turkey broth.  At least the croutons tasted better than the pretzels except there were tons of them.  The amount of croutons was overwhelming and dominated the serving.  The service was 4 stars good, but what I ate for the price easily knocks my rating down.  Maybe some of their other dishes are better or maybe they have more kinks to work out.  Either way I feel there are far better dining options around.",

Everything was cooked to perfection.  The bisque was full of flavor and just perfect on this brisk evening.   Mushroom were very tasty a great compliment to the bisque.   My NY Steak was full of flavor and just melted in my mouth.   Asparagus was great.  Mashed potatoes were light fluffy and delicious.   Desert was the perfect ending to the meal.  I had the signature carrot cake (Rafael suggestion) and my wife had the Aztec sundae. Carrot cake was moist cream cheese frosting fresh pineapple topping and a scoop of vanilla to add that creamy goodness to this decadent dish.   Aztec Cake is Venezuelan chocolate cake with white and spicy dark chocolate syrup   I only wish I had taken pictures.  Trust me come here and you won't be disappointed",

    "text": "I really wanna give this place 1 or 2 stars but they may not actually deserve it... but we bought two steaks, their most expensive ones, and they were terrible. Really bad in every way a premium steakhouse can be. Everything else was perfect, service, cocktails, sides... perfect. But all that is supposed to set up the main attraction, right? Over cooked, tasteless, and dry steaks, both the NY Strip and the Filet Mignon. If pressed, go with the Filet, but these are not quality cuts, properly aged, properly seasoned, or properly cooked. Why ask for a temperature if it's not coming out that way. Sure, they offered to replace it, but that sets the timing off for the meal. Maybe it's my fault as their are more expensive steakhouses in this property and all the adjacent ones, but $40 should still buy a decent steak, even in Vegas. The cocktails were great, both the Desert Smash and the custom Gin and Tonic. Also, the spinach dip, House made pita they substituted at our request, the mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower were awesome and better than expected. Just don't get the steak.",

    "text": "Go here if you want to sit outside and see the Bellagio Fountains, AND if you want to spend a lot of money on a mediocre meal. The service was so-so -- it was very busy when we were there, and I expect it is always busy because of the proximity to the Bellagio fountain.  We had a decent table inside, and the servers were whizzing by us, hurrying to tables with meals as if their marching orders were to turn tables over as quickly as possible. We started with martinis, $16 each and not even close to a full martini glass. Remove the pick and 3 giant olives, and the alcohol level drops significantly. We asked whether they serve bread basket or similar, and server said she could bring garlic bread for a price. I can't remember if it was $3 or $5, but whatever, it was too much. You know how old bread can be really fine crumbly, almost powdery when bitten?  It was that. Two small pieces of room temperature garlic bread served on a small plate that really should have been free. My husband then ordered the Jambalaya for $28, which was very good and a surprisingly large portion (much more than we expected). Beware, it is extremely spicy!  There is no accompaniment, no crackers or bread to tame the spice, unless you order the terrible garlic bread as a side.   I ordered the Sea Bass with Couscous for $38. It was prepared well, but was a very tiny portion of fish on a very tiny spoonful of couscous. I'm not one to want large dinner portions, but this looked slightly larger than what I would expect as an appetizer dish.   Our impression of the Hexx is that it is all about making as much money as possible as quickly as possible. People want to watch the Bellagio fountains while dining, and that's the draw. Once inside, patrons are rushed through a very expensive meal so the table can be cleared for the next diners and the next, and so on.",

Good guy and would ask for him upon request next time (if I decided to return).  My food was good but not great. I had the Hexx burger which included American cheese, fried onions, bacon, lettuce, tomato, white chocolate bun. My main YELP photo is actually of the burger. It was flavorful beef and the burger all together wasn't too shabby but the lettuce was literally one of those wedges of lettuce. The chunk was so large I thought Vegas would soon be going through a lettuce famine. I guess it may be considered \"cool\" when creating the menu but no one past, present, or future needs or wants that much lettuce on any type of sandwich.  With so many options on the Strip I wouldn't return as the only memorable thing is that damn lettuce.",

The atmosphere is like that of a club with loud club music, but not loud enough you can't have a conversation. The decoration, white and beige, is very modern and appealing.  Service was slow, and the server, while nice enough, want really friendly or welcoming.  The items seemed pricy for their descriptions and I opted to just have a snack, ordering the pretzels. They were good, with a mustard-cheese sauce that went great with them. You get three of them for $6, and they were basic pretzels. My wife had the bolognese, and it was a bit odd-tasting. Not really bad, but unlike any bolognese I've had in the past, in a disappointing way. Uppon requesting parmesan for the bolognese, the server referred us to a small cup of white powder that had been dropped off on our table sometime before without any comment.  My wife was in the mood for an Apple pie and she was pleasantly surprised. My dessert, the mille crepe cake, was just ok. The chocolate and berry sauce were good, but there wasn't enough for the portion.",

Sean and Patrick are the best! If you go ask for them they'll treat you like royalty, at least that's how our group and I felt. Spinach dip was on point, hexx Benedict were absolutely amazing, Sean even recommended a croissant or muffin along with it. Fresh berries and their French toast were great. All around awesome place must check it out. But thanks to Sean and Patrick your amazing service warmed our hearts they were extremely accommodating!",

Tasty sauce with added crisp of veggies, makes a new favorite on my list.  Branzino cooked to my liking with skin crispy and flesh moist and seasoned just enough. Enjoyed with side of yummy roasted brussel sprouts. Excellent meal with a glass of Chalk Hill Chardonnay. Hubby had the prime rib and a signature barrel aged drink similar to old fashion with the single large ice cube so as to not water it down. He was happy too. All for about $175 including tip. Two thumbs up! Oh, and did I mention we had great server, sat outside with view of Bellagio fountains?!! Made for a great Kickstarter to evening before a show.",

Live entertainment, lovely display & interior, & our view was right across the Fountains of Bellagio  We ordered the calamari which was so mouth watering, a pitcher of sangria (the best), and tried the wagyu burger which had a great presentation. It was probably one of the best burgers we've ever had. We tried to eat it slow & savor it as long as we could. Service was excellent as well I think our server was named Laurie or Laura and she was so very kind & helpful. We will definitely come back & try brunch next time!",

We were advised it would be about a 35 minute wait for the first available table, the place was busy, so we waited. 35 minutes turned to 45 which turned to an hour... the hostess explained they were \"cleaning tables\" but there were lots and lots of open tables. After inquiring about our wait time twice, we were finally called in. We were brought out to the patio but our table was in direct sun without cover, I asked if we could sit in one of the other five tables for two outside that were in the shade. We were told that those tables were already \"called for\" - you can't swap my table with another open table that is five feet away? Hostess gave no effort to accommodate. Why would they? There is a long wait list so who cares about two unhappy people. So, we walked out - no effort from anyone to have us stay.   If you are the type of person who likes hospitality and quality over quantity, this isn't the place for you. They've got a lot to work on in terms of managing the seating of guests and giving accurate wait times. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.",

My friends loved the salad! I had the burger and fries and the burger was good, but the fries were just okay. Atmosphere itself is great. They also have outdoor dining area and on those hot summer days a mist that gently spays you (not good for the hair though) :) I would return here the next time I come to town.",

Made for a fun evening. The food was good.  Nothing to write home about but definitely merits a note to Trip Advisor.  Interesting menu and we decided on the Jambalaya and the spaghetti with meat balls.  I really enjoyed the Jamabalaya as it had tons of perfectly cooked shrimp and had a nice kick.  Mmmm.  The mesketti was good.  The noodles were cooked a bit beyond al dente but not overdone.  The meat balls were tasty but could have used a touch more seasoning.  The real all star was the shaved garlic chips that had been pan-crisped.  Great touch. Only complaint?  Outrageous prices or a pint of beer.",

Sides : get the broccolini and the cauliflower. so good. and deserts -- the peanut buttter cheese cake was rich and delicious. and if you like after dinner cocktails -- the tiramusu deconstructed is really good. but it's very boozy. I have followed the new executive chef -- from Fiamma at the MGM (when it was good ) to his wine bar Due Forni and now at Hexx. He's really classed up this class.",

    "text": "Amazeballs. 5 stars all around. Incredible service, great food, very attentive staff. Went for a birthday dinner and we decided to go balls to the walls an order tons of drinks and a ton of food to split. We started with the Mystic Berries Potion which comes in a pitcher and gets all bubbly (see video). It came highly recommended and it was incredible. We asked for recommendations on an appetizer since we were still deciding on food, and our server Jessica recommended the crab cakes. They were beyond amazing, so we decided to try a couple more apps. We ordered the overcooked bacon and baked cheese. Both were incredible, great flavor fusion and overall very impressive. I think the baked cheese was my favorite of the three.  We finally made some moves towards actually picking dinner items an wanted to get another pitcher of drinks. We ended up with another drink (cant remember the name) and it wasn't as  good as the first drink, but still good none the less. We decided to split the roasted tomato bisque, tagliatelle bolognese and the chicken an waffles. The soup was delicious, lots of great flavor, the pasta was amazing and the chicken and waffles were to die for. They were served with apple butter and burbon maple syrup, which together made for a melt in your mouth combo that made me sad  that i was so full and couldn't finish it. I will definitely be back because we were so full we couldn't even order dessert!   Portion sizes were perfect, huge and great for sharing. They're open 24/7 so thats a huge plus. I can't say enough about how amazing our service was. Our server made great recommendations and  the staff was always coming by to clear the table and give us new settings an were extremely on top of their game the whole night.   We had a table on the patio so we had views of the fountains at Bellagio, and the restaurant itself was absolutely beautiful. Well done and a great night!",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise! Located inside Paris Hotel & Casino, we decided to try it out for an early dinner before a show, and we're really glad we did. Service at the bar was excellent. Great teamwork. Everyone seemed to work together as opposed to one person only handling your orders, which meant drinks and food arrived quickly after ordering.  The cocktails are fun, fresh and unique. The food was outstanding. Of all things, the standout was the broccolini appetizer. Honestly, we ordered it to get a little \"green\" in our diet, but after the first bite, we devoured it. The simple salad was fresh and light and the sea bass with butternut squash couscous was really good.  If we hadn;t been staying at Paris, we probably would have overlooked this place, but really glad we decided to stop in. I'll now seek it out for the broccolini alone!",

When the food came, my friends and I were really excited to eat. One of my friends ordered the veggie pizza and the other ordered the blt chicken sandwich. I ordered the hexx burger. all three of us had the same concensus: food was not flavorful. We had to ask for extra sauce to give it flavor... The price for average food was pretty expensive... Our dishes average to be about 18/dish. Probably won't come back here again. Bad first impression. One thing I wanted to mention was, they had this really yummy sauce called yum yum sauce. It turned out it was a simple mixture of Mayo and sirracha lol who knew such an odd combination could make such a good sauce.",

    "text": "dining in Paris... Las Vegas, that is!  Hexx is located in Paris Hotel and Casino just a few feet to the entrance of the Eiffel Tower. We were led inside by the host then back outside to a table out on the patio where the view was the dancing fountains across at The Bellagio. The weather was a comfortable low 70's.   The menu was small - appetizers, salad, steak choices, pasta and pizza, side items (sold a la carte), chilled seafoods and some entree's. For starters we had complimentary pita bread with dipping oil. Dinner followed and I had the Flat Iron Steak with an a la carte order of mashed potatoes. The steak was tender and juicy... so delicious! We also ordered Pepperoni Pizza and Artichoke Dip appetizer taking our time eating while pleasantly enjoying the fountains across the street at the same time. Although the music was a little faint we could perfectly hear the thunder of the fountains as they danced to a variety of music which came on every 15 minutes. Juan was our server and he did a great job taking care of our table along with another server who made sure our water glasses were never empty . Oh, and I love your accent, Juan... we were well taken care of by this team of servers. There is an attached candy store that we didn't get a chance to visit but we were each given a piece of chocolate after our meals. Teaser.   Perfect place to people watch too! For a while a couple of gals dressed as Las Vegas showgirls complete with huge feathers stood a few feet away from us. Sadly no one wanted to take a photo with them. They tried.    Overall, nice and pleasant experience here at Hexx.  Review #0906",

Bacon $5.95: The waffle doesn't come with any sides, so a side of bacon sounded good to me! It ended up being a really good idea to help cut the sweetness of the waffle.   Marife was our server and she was amazing! She was really friendly and personable. She even split the check for us by what we each ordered without us asking!

I took a bite of the Hexx Burger that a friend ordered... TWO THUMBS UP! Bun of the Burger has a hint of white chocolate taste.  Surprisingly delicious and goes well with the meat.  French dip was good, but nothing special.  You can get french dip anywhere else just as good for a lot cheaper price (Arby's or Lion's Choice).  I honestly don't even remember how it tasted.  That's how boring it was.   Maybe we went at a bad time too. Couple girls were very drunk and loud. They kept screaming at each other, but none of the workers went over there to ask them to quiet down or leave and continuously kept serving them more alcohol. They weren't even sitting that close to us, but we can hear their whole conversation.  It didn't bother me or my friends, we actually thought they were funny...but there were annoyed customers surrounding them.   Server wasn't as attentive as we wanted her to be.  She was sweet but......Refill our drinks and bring us our check already.  We got stuff to do.   Anyway, they gave us a little piece of chocolate with our check, but it was horrible.  I spat the chocolate right out.  Bleh!  Want to try their other desserts the next time I visit Vegas.  I believe they make their own desserts there so that's pretty awesome!",

The gnocchi was decent, could have used a bit more sauce; they were super tiny (but good portion size).  The cheese/meat plate was the highlight, so many options.  I wish they gave you more honey and bread to enjoy the different tastes.  Finished off with the s'mores dessert, which was ok (not exactly what I expected).    I'm not a fan of restaurants having a menu online without prices (seems like they're trying to trick you into going there).  We didn't order drinks, our bill (pre-gratuity) was around $85.    Our waiter (Kevin) was great, he even had pictures of the desserts on his phone, which convinced me to choose the smores over another option.",

    "text": "The location and view were outstanding especially if you sit outside.  The service was good but there was very little flexibility on making some minor changes to the menu items such as the type of cheese and side item with the Hexx Burger.  The hamburger was mediocre even with the overrated and overpriced white chocolate bun.  Other dishes such as the spinach artichoke dip and chicken & waffles were average - nothing out of the ordinary.    The main complaint I have with Hexx (other than being over-priced and offering mediocre food) is the surprise CNF (Concession & Franchise Fee) that is tacked onto your bill and leaves you no choice but to pay at the conclusion of your meal.  I have since learned that a few other Strip restaurants charge this concession fee and it's far worse than a resort fee because you get nothing whatsoever for it.  It's just a money grab fee tacked onto your bill that is kept by the restaurant owners and ranges from 3-5%.  My recommendation is to find out if the establishment imposes this fee before you are seated and if so, exit the premises.  Hexx does in fact charge this fee and as a result, I will not return.",

You'd expect to have the most amazing delicious \"I've never tasted something so good\" experience when you pay $120 for 2 people. Nope. The Filet Minon was $36 without any side dish. The mashed potatoes was $8 extra. And that wouldn't matter either if it was delicious. But it was spiced so weird. I eat steak all the time and this tasted odd and was way over spiced. The steak itself was tender and I'm sure it would have been delicious minus the spicing. So I tried ordering ice cream since they're known for their desserts. The chocolate ice cream was dark chocolate and bitter. Which I should have known because that's their specialty. But I just didn't like it. Overall I had a great time with my family but would have liked to have a better meal for the price.",

Service was incredible. Waitress was amazing.   We opted for the cookie Sundae. It was piled high with whipped cream, strawberry sauce and a cherry of course.   It was more of a cookie cake than an actual cookie. Consistency was fluffy.   The cookies and cream ice cream was good.   I'd probably pick something else off the menu next time but I'd definitely come back.",

    "text": "Um, seriously?  This is the 24 hour choice for Paris?  What happened to the all night steak and egg diners of Vegas past?   Woke up hungry after midnight and this or pizza were the only choices.  I had wanted to try this place anyway, so why not -- but no, never again.  Pulled pork French fries sounded great.  Well, if you like a big nasty lump of goo all glued together with cheese curds and swamped in some kind of nasty almost barbecue almost mayo/gravy.  Repulsive.  Literally tasted like something a small child would make by mixing every leftover in the refrigerator.   Clam chowder that came with the dry nasty salmon tasted like a dirty fish tank.  The salmon tasted old and way too fishy.  Gross.    The burger turned out to be almost decent, hence the 2 stars instead of negative 5 stars I would have given it for EVERYTHING else.  If you're starving to death in the middle of the night and have ABSOLUTELY no other choice than this place, at least don't waste your time on the other swill --have the $20 burger that is almost as good as Wendy's or Burger King. Almost.    Way overpriced for this crap. -- There actually is not a price low enough for this place. I would pass it up if they were giving away food actually -- Even though one expects overpriced on the strip.  Next time we will uber to the all night taco place or the Peppermill.",

The price is a little high for normal breakfast/brunch cost but nothing unexpected for the location and atmosphere. I highly recommend sitting outside as you have a great view of the strip and attractions, plus it's just a great vibe!   I ordered a coffee (black) and a bellini. Both were delightful but don't come close to how AMAZING the food was! I ordered the banana bread French toast and oh my gosh, I could eat it again right this second. Without a doubt, it was the best meal I had on the trip  A small warning: They casually suggest add ons such as fruit for many of their breakfast meals, these are an extra cost. Our server didn't mention the additional fee.",

There wasn't one dish that disappointed.  Outstanding ones were--carrot pancakes, Korean BBQ ribs with fried rice, the fruit platter was excellent ands beautifully served, and finally, I really could have continued eating the Banh Mi loaded fries until I couldn't walk anymore but I decided to draw the line somewhere.  Desserts were coming.  Then  came a parade of beautifully plated and very tasty desserts.  The Cookies N Cream was outstanding!!  The other two desserts that were super were the ginger panna cotta and the blueberry corn cobbler.  Service was excellent which is a hallmark of Hexx.  It was still warm enough to have the patio doors open and we could hear and watch Bellagio fountain shows until the colder weather set in and the doors were shut!  Excellent meal!  Thanks Ari and staff!",

We ordered the chicken and waffles and the Hexx eggs Benedict, with a side of buttermilk pancake. It was plenty of food for 2 and we packed up a big piece of chicken to go! Everything tasted fresh and delicious and we enjoyed the bottomless mimosa as well. Overall, great brunch ambiance and excellent food! Highly recommend!",

We got to watch the fountains in the light and then lit up at night throughout our dinner and it was pure perfection. The filet here is amazing and the roasted chicken plate is to die for as well! Amazing wine sauce on the chicken plate. You HAVE to experience their fun drinks!!! I suggest this one in the disco ball, but make sure to share with 2-4! The potions are fun too but not as much alcohol for the price. Thank you Hexx for such a fun night!",

The patio seating was gone by the time we arrived (around 6), but the rest of the restaurant was still open.   We were seated immediately, but they took a while to actually take our order. The food also took a while to come out. I ordered the Gnocchi and my boyfriend ordered the burger.   I was really excited to try out their Gnocchi, but I was pretty disappointed. I have had gnocchi from so many places and this one just did not hold its ground. It was overall very mushy and the sauce was nothing spectacular. The burger was similar in the sense that it was good, but nothing special. Portion wise the burger was pretty big and came with a side of fries.  Since the food didn't wow me and the service wasn't the best I give this place a solid three star. I may be back to try their brunch since most 5 star reviews seem to be about brunch. They do have a beautiful seating area, so if you are looking for a nice view of vegas while you dine this is the place for you! It's right across the street from the Bellagio fountains.",

We chose this place simply because that had patio seating, overlooking the stop, so we could people watch, while enjoying a good meal and a bottle....or two of wine. I had some rotisserie chicken dish over mashed potatoes and root veggies--I can't remember the exact name to save my life. But holy crap was it good!! I literally ate every bit of it..even the root veggie and I had no idea what the hell type of vegetables I was eating. It was so good, I didn't care. The service was also good. A little slow, but if your sitting out side, people watching and enjoying the water show across the way at the Bellagio, you don't even notice how slow the service is. They have a very nice wine menu with a lot of options. If/when I come back to Vegas, I'll definitely consider coming back to this restaurant, for a \"sure-thing\" meal!",

I also ordered the Hexx Benedict, which following the chicken and waffles (which had such rich flavor) was underwhelming.  For drinks, I ordered the bottomless mimosa, which only comes in the orange flavor. If you wanted other types of mimosas then it'll be an extra fee on top of the $24. I ended up drinking 3.5 glasses of mimosas. They're very good at refilling your drink so no need to worry about having to flag the server down. My fiance ordered the bloody Mary with bourbon; he said it was \"pretty good.\"  I would come back again next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Came here for Christmas brunch. We were walking The Strip to find something light to eat since we had dinner plans later. My mother couldn't remember the name of the restaurant she was a actually looking for in Paris so we settled for Hexx Kitchen & Bar.  Since we had been walking around Paris for my mom to jog her memory, we entered from the casino side. Like other casino restaurants, we were led to the Strip entrance. On the way, I noticed some cozy looking 2-seater indoor cabana-like tables (best way I could describe it!). Just past the hostess table is what appeared to be a fairly large and comfortable waiting area. Luckily, we didn't need to try it out as there was no wait time for us. It was a nice day out, not too chilly - I was comfortable in just a sweater. For that reason, I let the hostess know we wouldn't mind sitting outside.  My mistake. There are plenty of heaters on the patio so I actually got a bit too warm!  Our server was absolutely adorable! I wish I could have taken him home as a souvenir! I wish I could remember his name though... Anyway, he was extremely friendly and attentive. He got our drinks in a timely manner and correct! Side note: their pitchers of beer are fairly small and are the equivalent to about 2.5 beers.  Since we were trying to eat light, my parents shared the Veggie Omelet while I tried out the Surf n Turf Sliders. I didn't try anything on their plate, but it looked delicious. The sliders, however, left something to be desired. The lobster meat was tasty, but the short rib was dry even with plenty of sauce. The French fries were cold and salty. I'm sure they have the potential to be very tasty. I think the best part of my meal was the passion iced tea. Wonderful taste! Reminded me of plantation iced tea from home (Hawaii).  All the servers were very nice and polite. The female hostesses need to take some lessons from the servers. That's all I'll say about that.  I try to visit Vegas about twice a year and usually stay at Bellagio. I don't think I'll be craving Hexx anytime soon...except to maybe see my server again!",

We came for breakfast/brunch. Food came out quick, and our server was fantastic. However, food was pretty average for the price but it was good enough to where everyone left satisfied.

My girlfriend and I opted for the bottomless mimosas! The mimosas were delicious and strong (but not too strong). OLIVIA was our server and had great service. Our mimosas really never went bottomless! She filled them to the top Even when halfway full! KASEN did the same with our water!   Our chicken and waffles took no more than 10 minutes and it was delicious! Lots of food too!   All in all, overall great experience here with great service and great food!

Too much almond in the tiramisu and it was dry. The fancy s'mores wasn't crunchy and lacked a smooth warm chocolate sauce. Overall I was disappointed. I would try another option if I were you.

We arrived, and they could not find our reservation anywhere in the system; however, luckily it was a pretty slow night.  We were seated outside under the heat lamps (we preferred outside), with a great view of the strip.     We had the following items during our meal: Jumbo Lump Crab Cake - Shared it and it was large and delicious  Braised Short Rib Entree - I had this and the Braised Short Rib was tender and just fell apart, which was awesome; however, it was lacking some flavor and seasoning.  The accompanied mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were amazing.    New York Steak - Absolutely delicious (I tasted this, as the other person in my party had this).  It was cooked exactly as ordered.  Peanut Butter Cheesecake - Simple yet elegantly delightful.  Delicious!  Overall, our food was great.  Our server was \"tolerable\".  She wasn't bad in any way; however, she definitely showed off the vibe that she wasn't exactly pleased to be at work that evening.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try out this place, but NOW I'm even more excited to never revisit again.  We decided to sit at the bar area because we wanted to eat quickly. Welp, that was a joke because our dining experience was ridiculously long. Firstly, the blonde bartender who \"assisted\" us was beyond rude. We sat at a table for 15 minutes before she even gave us the time of day. The best part is the bar wasn't even busy. She was extremely unhelpful when elaborating on the menu and barely even came to check on us. Even when I tried to get her attention, she ignored us. Anyways...   We ordered mimosas, two basic salads and and the artichoke dip. It took over an hour just for us to get those items. The salad was a joke. It was costly and not worth it. If you want a salad, just go buy some from the grocery store and prepare it at home because it will probably have more flavor.  The spinach and artichoke dip was okay. I'm saying that it was okay because we were starving...so anything at that point was going to suffice.  The mimosas were eh. They didn't taste like they had any orange juice in them at all.   I feel like this place is overhyped for no reason. It left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. I won't revisit again.",

    "text": "On our last day in town, we decided to hit up this place for brunch. They are a short walk from Planet Hollywood and located on the strip just outside of Paris. We didn't get the chance to make reservations, but we had good fortune and they had a table available for our party (which was 11 people!) when we arrived.   I forgot the exact name of it, but we ordered a jug of berry mimosa (~36) for the table and was able to split a cup for everyone. It was a perfect refreshment to go with our brunch meal! After glancing at the menu for a few minutes, I decided to try the Chilaquiles ($17), which includes: chicken, roasted salsa tortilla chips, two eggs, avocado sour cream, asadero. This was a perfect just yum, it was a perfect brunch item that hit the spots with breakfast essentials such as eggs, protein, and some delicious sauce for flavor. The portion size was filling, my appetite left the restaurant quite content with the meal. I also tried some of my friend's Carrot Cake Pancakes, which was surprisingly pretty damn delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have eaten more! The pancakes were super filling, so you should probably share it with someone or expect to take home leftovers.  HEXX was one of our food highlights this trip. Minus the minor mishap with the bill, everything was excellent. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was friendly. The restaurant's ambience was also high-class, very open, and nicely decorated with light colors. The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountain as well, so the restaurant is located in a neat spot. HEXX is definitely one of my recommendations for food on the strip, especially if you are around this part of Vegas.",

We booked through Open Table and got a seat on \"the rail\" right on Las Vegas Blvd., which is a great people-watching spot. It took a bit to get a waiter, but once established, it was fine. The food, however, was terrific.  We started with the calamari, and apparently weren't paying attention to the menu. It was a wonderfully (and suprisingly) spicy dish with a good amount of sriracha. I had the prime rib. While restaurants seem unable to agree on what \"medium rare\" and \"medium\" are, the waiter was spot-on in his description. I ended up ordering medium, and it was exactly correct. The meat was so good, with something a little special about the creamed horseradish. It just seemed better than most, although I couldn't tell you why. My wife had the Hexx chopped salad, and says it is one of the best salads she's had. Ever. I tasted it and agree it was fantastic.",

The food is good, but it's hard to enjoy good food when you're missing a menu, searching for a fork, and have no one to order from. Yup, all good... why don't we just sit and enjoy air.  I'd be so embarrassed if my table stood up to get a menu because they were given the wrong one, grab forks because they were never given any, and ask where the server is. 'Twas a nightmare. By this time, the food was cold. We exchanged our pancakes out with the manager and that was pretty much it. No apology. No, \"How can we make this right?\"   We used to always come here. Don't know when we'll be back. Food shouldn't be stressful - especially when you're paying for it.",

There are tables to choose from and also comfy couches to lounge on. In the bar area you can sit in quaint nooks for privacy. The natural lighting from the strip is perfect on a sunny day.  Food: Alexxas has a small bites and tapas menu and the Hexx menu has delicious entree and brunch options depending on the time of day and day of the week. We tried the ceviche, chicken sausage flatbread, and calamari. The calamari was my favorite! It had a light drizzle of buffalo and ranch and was like having buffalo wings but in the form of light and fresh calamari. We decided to try desert with the churro bites - oh man! The caramel dipping sauce has an alcoholic surprise we weren't ready for! The Hexx chocolate dip was Rich and dark and a perfect Compliment.   Drinks: We tried cocktails including the key lime martini and the pinky swear sangria. Everything was fresh and light and crafted perfectly.   Service: our server was prompt and friendly. The churro bites took a very long time but were worth the wait.   Overall: I am excited to come back and enjoy more of what Hexx has to offer! There's tons of items on the menu to come back for and it's great having a local hangout on the strip that's not too far from Home!",

Staff was nice but I would not come back on the food alone as this is why I had decided to dine. For those touring the city, don't feel like you have to stop here or missing out if you can't. Plenty of other good places as the food scene in Las Vegas is huge.   Baked Spinach Dip - Luke warm, tasted like it was store bought, and you could tell as the cheese got hard and dry very quick. I could harshly taste any spinach.   Chicken & Waffles - lacked flavor and seasoning. The chicken was really moist but just a little bland for what the dish is. Basic southern chicken and waffles is full of flavor in any recipe. I had to add tons of salt and pepper, which I wasn't used to doing. Maybe I got a bad batch?   House Fries - also lacked seasoning and not sure how as they had Parmesan cheese, spices, and looked delicious in pictures.   Protein Omelette - didn't even finish this as also lacked flavor.",

They had breakfast menu at noon! Score! I had the veggie omelet and it was descent. Nothing really exciting but the potatoes were good! I also got the carrot cake pancake to share with the table. It was a little dry but still good. So if you're up for breakfast food late in the afternoon then you can always be sure to find it here. Thank you for serving breakfast for this late sleeper!",

The drinks which were previously made of candy are now made of fruit, which is always a great thing. They still smoke and make both kids and adults smile and snap.   Im in b/w a 3-3.5 for this place and kind of wish yelp had a half point system so i can increase my rating by half a point.  We came here for dinner and lunch. Dinner was definetly a better experience than lunch. The dinner and lunch menu are similar except some slight differences.   For dinner, we got the spinach and artichoke dip as appetizer and shared the shrimp scampi for entree. The dip was quite tasty and came with chips and pita chips. The dip tasted much better with chips to we stuck to them but if you are extra hungry, the appetizer is quite filling.  The shrimp scampi was delish and we cleaned the plate away.  For lunch, me and a friend ordered the chicken and waffles (hugee dish btw) and another friend ordered the cheeseburger. Both entrees were ok. The chicken was definetly the star of our dish and was a huge portion. Easily shareable between two people and a third could also take some bites. Only thing i didnt like was that i dont tend to like a huge portion of fried chicken just being dumped on my waffle - thus making it soggy. I also like plain maple syrup and theirs had a strong cinnamony kick to it so if you are like me, order the plain one.",

She danced with us, kept the mimosas with the help of Ginger and Bobby who was super cool too.

Went to find out they cancelled the reservation. Um, why? Idk. I set the reservation at 11:30 AM when I was in the hotel at around 9:30 AM.   Upon arrive to the restaurant, the women were saying that after 15 minutes from making the reservation, they cancel it.   I don't get it and asked them to explain to me twice. Still didn't make any sense to me.   I got the chicken and waffle.  Was pretty good. Server was not attentive. Had to flag down for coffee/water refill.   Oh, and they add a cnf fee to the receipt. Which I am docking another star for.   I googled it and read an article saying to think of it as a 'resort fee' but you don't get anything for it.   So they add a charge for just eating their over priced food.   Oooookkkaaaay.  Good to know but won't be back.",

He represented his company very well! The  food... Un-be-lievable!!! The presentation was that of a Top Chef episode. Lastly, there's no question I'm choosing to dine in here whenever I'm in Las Vegas again. We had 2 strikes against us going into tonight's meal, but we hit a grand slam!!

I got the HEXX Benedict, without bacon, and I would not recommend it for those looking for a traditional Benedict fan. Instead of poached eggs on top of an English muffin, they are served over scalloped potatoes; making the overall texture of the dish soft. I ordered an extra side of toast to add some crunch to the texture and was happy I did. The rest of my party was content with their food, but not impressed with their dishes.   Aside from the average food, the attentiveness if the servers is great. Also, it was my friend's birthday and they brought out complimentary cake pops which was very thoughtful of them.   Overall, wouldn't return for brunch, but would give the restaurant another chance for dinner.",

However, you can't enjoy your meal when your server purposely makes you feel like trash. Incident was 12/30/18 around 4:30pm party of 10.",

From the outside it doesn't look like much. There's was a real nice girl holding up a menu but she didn't really know that much about the menu items.   They tried to give us an amazing table on the patio but we wanted to sit inside so they found us a table. Our server was Lisa and she was awesome from start to finish. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us a lot of great suggestions. I ordered the beef short rib with horseradish mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. It was amazing. The meat was very tender and melt in your mouth. Horseradish mash - delicious and the BR were flavorful and crunchy. We ordered the broccolini and it was definitely a hit at the table. My boss ordered the salmon. It came out over the top of a red clam chowder soup with actual clams. He said it was very good.   For drinks I ordered a bubbles champagne drink to start and a glass of Malbec with dinner and I would recommend both. Great restaurant, excellent service - can't wait to come back.  After our desserts they also brought out little chocolates with fortunes. Very cute!",

The breakfast pizza was great! Far better than lousy midwestern version made to taste like something you get at a gas station. Nice crust, cheese sauce and I believe that they pour on liquid scrambled eggs then bake added with Sausage and more cheese. Bomb! The Eggs Benedict was wierd.... not wierd bad but wierd good! No English muffin, on a bed of scalloped potatoes (I know)  came out delicious! Really rich! My wife and I switched plates half way through! Still brought back to the room half of the pizza! Friendly honest wait staff!",

We ordered a spinach artichoke dip (5/5) best I've ever had, but we had to ask pita bread along with it, because the toasted bagel bites were hard and stale (1/5). Broccolini was pretty good and we loved the flavor (4/5). White bean hummus dip (5/5) so goooood! I also ordered lobster tail (3/5), but was disappointed in the small size and it wasn't the best I've had. I've had better at Red Lobster. They brought out a carefully decorated birthday cake for me with flowers on it! It looked much better than it tasted. But it was free! Prices were expensive, but well worth it.  Overall, I would recommend this place and would come back again next time!",

I was with my entire family and we were served by Tracee(?). I am usually pretty understanding because I use to work in restaurants and it's tough when the kitchen gets slammed with orders all at once. However, my dad asked for ketchup, and she never brought it. Understandable, because there maybe was a lot going on. But, I asked for a to-go box twice. It took us about 30 minutes just for us to get the check, pay, receive the to-go box, and leave. And it wasn't busy at all. I was just disappointed based on all the great reviews from this place. It seemed like every body else was getting great service, as they were enjoying their bottomless mimosas. I'm not sure if it's because we didn't order drinks that we weren't as well taken care of, but I was extremely disappointed. We never were rude about anything, and I just hope that this isn't how service usually is for families that aren't buying drinks. Idk what the case was, but I just didn't feel as if my family was as respected as guests as other people. Just because we aren't ones to complain doesn't mean we are okay with the lack of urgency with service. I don't plan on ever coming back, not that it's a big deal to their restaurant. But just be cautious if you notice you aren't being as well taken care of. I should've said something and put my foot down because I was extremely disappointed with our server even if I really tried giving her the benefit of the doubt.",

The vibe is casual, and the wait staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The weird thing we noticed was we had a wait to be seated, and upon being seated we walked through a whole empty dining area. I dunno, but it worked out because we sat on the patio and the weather was beautiful.   We ordered the garlic bread appetizer and I got The Hexx specialty drink. I'm a bit weeny when it comes to alcohol and asked if the bartender could make it so I wouldn't really taste the alcohol. They accommodated me very nicely and The Hexx tasted amazing. They offer many different drinks and wines, and like The Sugar Factory they had \"Potions\", which takes place of the Goblets.   I ordered the chicken and it was delicious, the eggplant was also cooked perfectly and tasted sweet. I did order the French fries, and this is where they lost a star for me. We paid $10 for a basket of fries and they were stale and cold. I only ate about 5 of them, that was a disappointment but the other items we ordered were perfect. I'll let this slide, and who knows what the circumstance was.   I definitely recommend this place, it is quite expensive but we had a pretty view and had a great dining experience.",

The service for drinks was quick and they frequently came around with the coffee pot refilling our drinks.   I ordered the eggs benedict. It was absolutely DELICIOUS. I definitely recommend ordering the eggs benedict. PLUS its served over scallop potatoes. It was also filling! My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. The portion was nicely sized for the price.

Our server Sean was absolutely incredible, I never ran out of a mimosa and I was treated with a wonderful birthday dessert. We ended up coming back the next day for him and the bottomless mimosas but he was too busy in his section :(  The food was incredible and the service even better. The ambiance of the restaurant itself is just as amazing. Totally recommend (this restaurant and sean) and will be back.",

The service was very friendly and my bottomless mimosa glass was never empty. The sticky bun was to die for. And my husbands chicken and waffles were amazing. Waffles just melted in your mouth. My eggs Benedict was incredible and served over potatoes versus an English muffin. I will def eat here every visit to Vegas.",

Yes we drank as much as we could and had fun. Yep we got drunk. BUT I swear to GOD we did not get crazy. We asked for a shot after bottomless mimosas were over they told us no. All we did was ask \"why?\" What did we do? We asked why are we being cut off we're not doing anything crazy and they wouldn't give us reasoning. So we got upset and we're like ???? What did we do to upset everyone? We paid, we tipped VERY well, we weren't being crazy or wild or eccentric. So the cops took Us into holding. I begged to have my handcuffs loosened because it hurt so bad. I tried to tell my friends don't yell at the security guard she's just doing her job, she completely ignored us. So I'm fucking livid. I'm pissed. This is the ABSOLUTE worst restaurant I have ever been to. I called the hotel, called the restaurant -- everyone hangs up. Call police, anyone at all, all hanging up on us. Asking \"how do we get her out\" no answer. We weren't driving, took an Uber but STILL arrested AFTER paying 130+$ for everything. Held in the holding cell, BEGGED and CRIED to use the bathroom but \"could not\" until paper work was done. Almost peed my pants for what????????? Because we wanted one more shot?????? Because what???? Who gave them the right????? Yes, we drank. Yes, we got a bit drink and so what??? Opportunity to send us to jail???? We did NOTHING. Swear, we went to the bathroom, remained calm and when we FINISHED paying we were attacked???? We even treated the whole staff amazing, complimented them I just can't believe it. Held our phones, our purses, our belongings. Locked us in the room with seat belts once they found out we were recording. Please don't go here. This place is disgusting.",

Dinner service at Hexx. Immediately off-put by server unsure about getting us prior delicious punch bowl. It arrives. She hates us. We watch everyone around us get food and dranks. No food for us. 20-30 minutes go by. Appetizers come out with some food. Uhhhkay. Boyfriend still without entree. Friend gets food, throws up 3 times in bathroom, comes back. Still no entree for Bae. Other table gets punch bowl. Bae gets salad he hates and never ordered in lieu of entree. Manager insures us that salmon is coming. Server doesn't want to show her face. Salmon comes and we still pay full price for everything except unwanted salad. Takeaways: water re-fill guys are the real heros. Service is abysmal. Food is flavorful. Drinks are above par.",

    "text": "Start off service is whatever. Our waitress didn't seem to care or she just doesn't like her job. Either or whatever. We had to ask for lemon for our waters 3 times. We finally placed our orders and I was so excited to try to carrot cake pancake which was the ONLY reason why I came here. And I had to order it without walnut since I'm highly allergic. After we placed our order our waitress let us sit for about 10 mins before coming to tell us that they can not omit walnuts. She didn't seem to care. She was more like so yea we can't do that so sucks to be you. What you want to order then?   Ok first off. It's 2018 A LOT of people are allergic to peanuts and walnuts what restaurant makes their batter PRE MIXED with nuts? Now I am sitting here with nothing because the ONLY reason I came here was for the \"so call amazing service\" and these amazing carrot cake pancakes. Sucks for a majority of American who suffer from a nut allergy cause this restaurant ain't for you. Don't bother coming by cause the servers don't care and won't even try to see if they can make a batch with no nuts. Or head chef you need to think about peoples allergic needs........  UPDATE. So apparently the servers here like to peep at your phone. And she saw me leaving the review and got the manager. Which he saved the day. And he was more then happy to get the pancakes made without walnuts. And I must say the pancakes were AMAZING. I am SO GLAD. They are so delicious and the cream cheese frosting was so light and fluffy. DEFINITELY A MUST TRY  And I'm sorry but I feel bad for all those people who don't use yelp. I hate that in order for a restaurant to understand that people have allergies that you have to do a review on Yelp. That's not the purpose of Yelp. It should never be a means of \"blackmailing\" the restaurant in order for them to provide great customer service. It should be given. Overall after a very rocky start. And the beginning of a 1 star review it sky rocketed to a full 5 star review. I hope this comes as a lesson to the restaurant that customer service should be given. And I hope you can give any other customer even without the power of Yelp to be accommodating.",

However, since this is my second experience I feel obligated to write an honest review. The food is average at best (today had the hex burger and prime rib dip) and the service leaves much to be desired, especially our server Tracee who served us both times we visited (we almost moved the second time but decided not too make a big deal). She took our order and then we never saw her again until we hunted her down to ask for the check which took forever. I'd like to mention that we are during off peak hours.",

    "text": "Okay, there are so many choices for food in Vegas, so I asked Yelp for help, as usual, and it gave me Hexx. I made a reservation 45 minutes ahead for 3pm, mostly because unlike most places, they serve brunch until 4pm. It was fairly busy, but the atmosphere has quite a bit of class, which I really appreciated after being so disappointed by Tony Roma's the night before. The choice of indoor or outdoor seating was nice, but if you can't do heat, know that it's all open air, so there is no A/C to save you if it is too warm out for you. They servers were all well-dressed, and always moving. My server was friendly, attentive and thoughtful. I also had a really good view of the fountain at the Bellagio as it danced to the music a few times - a nice perk of sitting here. And now, the food! Two words: Hexx Benedict - the best Benedict I have ever had. Au gratin potatoes replace what would classically be the position for an English muffin, topped with Canadian bacon, perfectly poached eggs, and just enough hollandaise to cover the two eggs - fantastic! My raspberry mimosa was very good, though I wonder what I would have done if I showed up early enough for their bottomless mimosa, Haha! Anyway, I still had room for dessert, and the waiter recommended Hexx's version of a s'more - torched marshmallows on a homemade Graham cracker, atop a vanilla ice cream square which sits on a chocolate-covered Graham cracker...what? Yes, amazing, and with perfect portions, they nailed what I was looking for - all the flavor, decadence and satisfaction, with none of the bloat. I recommend a visit here for brunch if you find yourself in Vegas.",

If u get seated in the patio you'll have a fantastic front seat view of the Bellagio water show. We ordered white bean hummus ($10), chopped salad ($13), carbonara ($26) and Pepsi ($4.95). Not really price friendly but you're basically paying for the location and people-watching. The hummus and salad were both so-so and carbonara was equally blah. Service was great surprisingly - it had a lot to do with it being 11pm and the servers were bored and not having to serve multiple tables. I'm glad I used a Groupon otherwise I'd really cry for the overpriced items on the menu... I mean, skip it.",

We started with bloody mary's - one was \"bacon infused\" and the other was spicy. Both of them were tasty but seemingly light on the alcohol (which was fine...we weren't looking to get loaded). They have several special bloody mary choices - one of which looks like a meal (and it's $38...)!  We ordered one of the appetizers: candied bacon - which was just OK. Tasted like bacon; was expecting maybe a bit more sweet based on the description (maple glazed and cacao nibs). Also, a piece of wax paper got cooked up and delivered with the bacon...so that was a little weird. Kitchen dropped the ball on that one.  I had shrimp cocktail for my lunch and it was 6 pieces of very nice, jumbo shrimp. My companion had a burger and enjoyed it.   Service was very good - efficient and friendly.  After reading some of the reviews, it seems that this might be a better choice for a decadent breakfast/brunch.",

Very pleasant watching the parade of people while eating good food. The chicken and waffles were very moist and the added pickles were perfect. They were thin shaved and perfect for the dish.",

Not related to any of the other reviewers here... didn't come with them and I don't know them lol but the experience was the same so that should tell you something...  Came here on Saturday at 11am for brunch. Portions are small, prices are high, wait is long (30-40 minutes, even with a pointless reservation), service is mediocre, food is absolutely nothing special.   I had the chilaquiles, which was a mistake. Egg was fried hard (like, what?), no chicken, and the red sauce tasted more like pasta sauce.   My husband had the eggs Benedict. It was ONE egg on ONE half of an English muffin, basically a half portion. For almost $30. It tasted ok.   However, it was nice sitting on the patio in the beautiful weather watching people walk the strip and the Bellagio fountains do their thing...None of which is by this restaurant's own doing.  If you're trying to actually eat a tasty meal, don't come here. The prices are laughable for the food, wait, and service. If you wanna pay at least $100 for a cool place to sit, by all means...enjoy!",

But we tried two dishes and while one was awesome, the other was not.   Loaded Fries - Start with great Fries (nice crunch on the outside, flavorful and soft on the inside) and topped with cheese curds, gravy and \"BBQ pork\". While the pork was tender and had been pulled, there was nothing BBQ about it - no sauce, seasoning or smoke that I could taste. But that's ok, because the gravy was nicely done. Also, the cheese curds had completely melted and turned into gooey goodness! All in all, we loved this dish!  Blondie Sundae - This was the major fail for me. To start with, as far as I know, a Blondie is meant to have the same thick and chewy texture that a brownie has. This did not. This tasted spongy and fake as if it came from one of those awful just add water box mixes. Second, the menu said that it would be topped with Oreo ice cream. But what arrived was boring vanilla. When I asked about it, the waiter seemed to not know and guessed they must have run out. Fail!   At this point I am willing to give this place another shot. But I would probably stick to the appetizers and avoid the desserts.",

I love the high tables and tall windows with all the natural light shining in and the overall modern/upscale feel. Wouldn't expect it to be as reasonably priced as it is compared to other Vegas restaurants.   Food: When I came for dinner there was a little hiccup where the server never put in my order and then when my steak finally came out it was overcooked, so I had to send it back and wait some more. The key manager on duty was a little off putting when I was explaining the situation, but the server was very apologetic and everything was fixed right away and the steak was delicious I would definitely order it again. Mac and cheese wasn't that great so I'd probably get a different side. For brunch I got the Carbonara Pizza, with the crispy bacon and cheesy fontina, I almost ate the whole thing it was so yummy!  Drinks: HEXX's bubbling potions are fun to share and get you where you need to be, if ya know what I mean. They are pretty pricey but hey you're in Vegas enjoy yourself! If you come for brunch opt in for the bottomless mimosas, loosen up and enjoy your fave jams courtesy of the live dj!",

MEH. Although fried to perfection, the inside was off tasting and the texture a little too mushy for my like. an app that tasted extremely heavy even though it doesn't look it.   -SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP: Cheesy, creamy, excellently fatty for the chips and the pita was so fresh and warm you wouldn't believe that was possible at this time of night and with the cool weather. It was good, heavy.   -CHICKEN AND WAFFLES: Great! I love this dish and wanted to check it out and it delivered. Juicy perfectly fried chicken, seasoning on point, saltiness just right, the apple-cheddar waffle was soft inside, slightly crunchy outside, sweet, excellent batter i have to say. The bourbon maple syrup was delicious and just rightly sweet. Must get!  Good service. Despite a miss (crab cakes), most of the meal was good and I would recommend this place.

Also, the music selection attracted me. The Top 40 mixed with throwbacks soundtrack made it very upbeat and live.   We went for brunch around 10:30 on a Monday and we were seated immediately on the patio. This place is so damn cute! It's very big so there is plenty of seating and one whole side is pretty much outside. The servers were very nice and attentive. The main reason I wanted to come here was to try the famous HEXX potions. They are similar to the goblets you get at Sugar Factory..very fruity with dry ice in them to add smoke...like a potion! Lol. They are expensive. ($36 for one) It is big enough for two but one person can definitely finish it. The elixir potion is a must try!   I ordered the french toast and scrambled cheese eggs and my boyfriend had a grilled chicken BLT. Both were DELICIOUS! I want to try every single thing on their menu! And like most places, they have bottomless mimosas. We tried to go back Tuesday morning around 7am but they told us an incident happened in the kitchen and they were closed until 10. I was so hurt.

It was kinda annoying though that the table was right beside a loud speaker. So my husband and I were practically shouting at each other so we can be heard. I ordered the cinnaroll waffle with berries and it was delicious. Although, it's not something that I haven't tasted before. However, the drink that I ordered, called the serious business, is very, very good. It's a mixed drink but tasted like whiskey. My husband ordered the hexx Benedict. He said that it was interesting and very tasty. Instead of regular potatoes, the Benedict included mashed potatoes.  The service was good. Our server was very attentive.

If it's your first time having breakfast here I recommend you to do the reservation online because when you get there even though they have empty seats they won't sit you right away.  Our server one day was very friendly and I remember I had the lobster sandiwch and she asked the chef if they could do it for me even it wasn't on the menu.  Next day he was completely annoyed. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because the consistency of the food wasn't the same as last year.  It really tasted like they have all the dishes ready to go and they just warm them up so you can finish quick and go.  As you can see I'm including the pictures from last year which I didn't get the chance to write a review but you can see a lot of difference not only by looks but by flavor as well.  The potatoes one day were hard and the next day were so mushy that I just couldn't finish them.  I had the chilaquiles and I think I'll stick with the eggs next time.  The alcoholic drinks are really good and worth trying, I would come back but it won't be the same expectation I had from the last two years I went.",

Did I mention there is a vending machine that serves nothing but CHAMPAGNE? Yep. There is.   I had an absolutely amazing flight of sangria's. Idk maybe two flights. They were legit incredible.  We had great service and a great view. Can't wait to get back to Vegas and sit on the open patio drinking my flights.",

We ordered the blue Elixir (awesome when they pour it into the pitcher of ice!), turf & surf sliders, and a side of risotto. The sliders were pretty good. The risotto is a small serving but I didn't find it that flavorful.  Brendan was our waiter and was very attentive and nice. He offered to wait if we wanted to take a video of the pouring of the Elixir. One suggestion is to close the doors leading outside as it was quite chilly. Also they charge an extra fee for maintenance of the restaurant - it's listed in the bill so just a heads up.",

We took advantage of the bottomless mimosas- you get 2 hours; we did have to continually signal the waiter, but we found the bottom! Lol. The brunch dishes are good, but not amazing, and the prices are not indicative of taste. I am overall unimpressed- friends and alcohol trumped service.",

    "text": "Ordered the chicken & waffles, the Eggs Benedict and pitcher of the Bubbly mimosa. Let's start with the Chicken. 2 fried breasts were given, topped with pickles which surprisingly went well together.  The 1st breast was actually better than the 2nd. The 1st breast's breading was crisp but not too crunchy. It was friend very well, leaving the meat still moist. Unfortunately the 2nd was fried to a crisp, leaving the crust too hard and the meat dried out. I've had beef jerky more tender than that 2nd piece! For a $24 entree that was s but of a lot down. I'd give the 1st breast a B and the 2nd a D. The waffle was pretty standard but tasted ok. Overall the chicken & waffles earned a C.  The Eggs Benedict earned solid C. The egg whites were a bit undercooked. The temperature was not warm enough either. The potatoes underneath were bland and needed more season.   The Bubbly mimosa was actually pretty good. For $36 tho the value was not really there IMO however.  The staff was friendly and efficient. All in all the whole experience was a C.",

Nana - she was very unhelpful. She sat us at a front patio spot where the sun was bearing down on me ( I was also with 2 other ladies). When a nearby table finished and our food had not arrived yet, i requested a table change. Nana asked the table server, Antonio, if that was ok and I visually observed him nod his head in a \"yes\" motion. But Nana did not want to change us so Nana told Antonio to tell us no. Wow Nana, I asked you the question, it's only professional and courteous if you gave me the answer rather than telling someone else to do it for you.  I will not be back nor shall I ever recommend this place to another person.",

She was very attentive in answering all of my questions and quick to send over updated proposals as they needed adjustment.  Christian, the manager, was so insanely helpful when we got there before the happy hour. He showed us where everything was, and where guests would most likely come from. The space was excellent, and he even gave us little seating pods as part of our space.  Alexia, the server, and Sabino, the busser, were so great with our guests! They were always checking in on drinks. We never ran out of the apps for guests. The food was great, and they had a wide variety of drinks -- from wine to spirits to beers.  I really cannot speak highly enough about hosting a happy hour/corporate meal at Hexx while you're in Vegas! My company will definitely be hosting there again because we had such a great experience!",

We were celebrating my wife's birthday in Vegas and decided to try Hexx, due to the availability of getting a reservation for 14 people, with no strings attached. Most places we checked had a $150.00 minimum with that many people.  We are so glad we ate here. The food and staff were amazing. The staff never allowed a glass to go empty, they were all over us. Maria was the best, she is an exceptional waitress. Great personality and attitude. She also made paying the check very easy, she allowed us to split it accordingly. They made my wife's birthday very special. We will definitely go back when in Vegas again. Thank You Hexx, great experience!",

    "text": "The corn beef hash should be HASHED OFF THE MENU! There was hardly any corn beef, and as another yelp review stated, there were NO sweet potatoes. Maybe they were substituted for carrots?!? The only things perfect about this dish were the eggs and the presentation, but from a flavor profile something was lacking... maybe seasoned sweet potatoes? Also the portion is rather small considering it is mainly veggies for $16. Anyway I came here with the intent to have a nice hearty breakfast to prepare for a day of drinking.... unfortunately that didn't happen with the corn beef hash.  I did have a chance to taste the chicken and waffles which was a heartier option. The chicken and syrup were good, the waffle was just ok. Also, if you are expecting to have a nice relaxing breakfast to mentally prepare for the rest of the day, that won't happen here. The music is loud and fun, and so are the large parties at tables. Also there is an awesome bottomless mimosa option for $24, which probably played into the atmosphere.  Personally if I ever returned here, I'd eat breakfast prior and take part in the mimosa special. And maybe if I get drunk enough eat something, but NOT the corn beef hash.",

    "text": "Brunch, Saturday, reservations for 10am.  Pros: - delicious food. We ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs, chicken and waffles, Cinnabon waffle, sticky bun. The corned beef and hash was a mixture with a little bit of gravy, different from what I'm used to but in a good way; the poached eggs and sauce were perfect. Cinnabon waffle blew my mind, not too buttery or oily like some waffles can be. Very mild apple and cheddar flavor, but otherwise a really great waffle; chicken was moist and flavorful. Sticky bun was absolutely delicious; sweet but just what you'd expect of a toffee-laden bun. Super satisfied after this meal.  - friendly staff - conveniently located on the strip - Not only was the food delicious, but it came out rather quick  Cons: - slight wait despite reservations, it's a really popular place - moderate noise level, but it's pretty quiet for being on the strip in Vegas  - valet parking is $15-20 ish.   Verdict: I'd go back if our schedule allows but would only do so if we could get reservations. The wait without would be quite long, especially for seats on the patio.",

My friend, who ordered the filet mignon, and I both agreed that the steaks were a bit over seasoned to the point that they almost tasted dry. They do offer dressings/sauces, so you have that option in case this is a concern for you.   The steaks do not come with sides, so you will have to order those a la carte. The mashed potatoes are so so so so good, if you are a mashed potato fan, you have to try these in your lifetime at some point.   The prices are reasonable for a steak house, but especially so for it's prime location on the strip and tremendous view of the Bellagio and it's fountain shows.",

This drink was excellent! For my dinner I had the *Korean BBQ Ribs* which were tender and delicious, however this came with \"fried rice\" which was too spicy and not mentioned on the menu as hot or with any heat at all, but only listed as \"fried rice\". My mouth was on fire which killed my appetite at dinner. The *Bolognese* was scrumptious, but a tiny portion although featured on their menu under \"large plates\". The staff were friendly and nice, the ambiance provided special vibes, but the food was disappointing. 2.5 Stars.~",

We had A great server, teddy, who was excited about the menu and had knowledge about every dish and could help us make decisions about what to order.   For our cocktails we ordered the South of the Boarder, a spicy strawberry margarita. Very delicious with a hint of spice. So don't let the \"spicy\" throw you off   Appetizer was the Lump Crab. This was awesome. Normally crab cakes are small but this came out with plenty to share for two people.   For entrees I went for the salmon. It was perfectly cooked on a bed of quinoa,peas and mushrooms. Very delicious  My husband got the short rib. Meat was perfect along with the mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. I highly recommend them both.   Dessert was the blueberry crumble. It was a perfectly light dessert after a big meal.   I only got a photo of the appetizer because we enjoyed the meal so much I forgot to take other pictures.   Overall I have hexx such a high rating for the atmosphere, service and food. The travelzoo discount was an added bonus, I would have paid full price for this meal for sure.",

We tried the burger and the veggie omelet and both were tasty and well prepared.   Our server was kind and hospitable, but also extremely busy and overwhelmed with a packed house. This meant we had to wait seemingly forever for our bill long after we ready to leave,and also wait unnecessarily for condiments that we requested at the beginning of our meal.

We came into dine for breakfast on Christmas eve around 9 in the morning. There was no wait and we were seated promptly.  Everything on their menu looks amazing. It was hard to decide between all the wonderful sounding options but narrowed it down to the following three:  Carrot cake pancakes $13 Eggs Benedict $16 Twisted Bun $8  The carrot cake pancakes were to die for! Bursting with flavor just as if you were eating a piece of carrot cake. The eggs benedict were equally as delicious! They are served with a bit of a twist, potatoes instead of english muffins, we weren't mad though. It paired perfectly with the other elements in the dish. The twister bun (cinnamon roll) came out piping hot. The frosting puts this over the top. It was melt in your mouth delicious.   Don't forget to sit on the outdoor patio to get a view of the Bellagio fountains as you eat.  Overall this place is a major win and I can't wait to go back!",

We made a reservation since we had a bigger party and because we were celebrating three birthdays that occurred over the week.   First when we arrived there was confusion as to what reservation we were but it was handled. Then we were sat outside and had a great view of the fountains and spot to people watch.   I mean cmon part of the fun of Las Vegas is people watching and taking pictures of your 16 year brother with nude truck advertisements driving in the background. Haha.   Anyways, the service was nice and the menu was reasonably priced but a little steep for what it was in my opinion. Bread was served complimentary at the beginning and the oil served with it was good.   I ordered the veggie pizza that had butternut squash  and other stuff on it (see picture). I am 99% sure this was vegetarian but not positive. They do advertise that they have vegan and gluten free options so if anyone in your party is vegan or gluten free they are safe to find a tasty option here.   The pizza was really good and unique, I liked it a lot.   I also tried some of the salad (Cobb maybe, I can't remember the name, but it looked and tasted like a Cobb style).   Then the three of us celebrating birthdays were brought out dessert with candles and that was so cute and thoughtful in my opinion. So I blew out the candle and made a wish.",

I ordered the colossal Bloody Mary and it could have been a meal! There are so many snacks included. Shrimp, a crab leg, beef jerky and so much more. The Bloody Mary itself was really good too!  The chilaquiles I ordered were ok -nothing amazing. If I go back I will probably try the French toast. It looked pretty great!",

    "text": "First and foremost, thank you to Daniel - our server (2/11 around 6pm) who provided exceptional customer service!  ... because of him, I would definite consider a second visit; from what I hear..brunch is quite popular here with the indoor and outdoor experience.   Hexx can be located on the outside of Paris Hotel. The perk about this restaurant is its location; it's directly across from the Bellagio Fountains, so be sure to request a \"table seat\" of you're looking for a meal with a view.   The overall ambiance of this establishment is \"classy-casual-dining.\" The decor may come off as \"fancy\" but that's just the classy coming out. No need to throw on a suit and tie, but no sneakers & sweats - if you catch my drift.   The menu is great! It offers a little bit of everything with it's American dining inspiration. For appetizers my gf and I tried the Beef Carpaccio (5 stars) and the Surf and Turf sliders (braised beef and lobster, 5 stars).   For our mans we both tried pasta dishes: the gnocchi and carbonara. I can report that I was slightly disappointed with the carbonara. Although it looked creamy and appeasing, it lacked a lot of flavor and I truly feel like I wasted $26 on this dish that I maybe had 4 bites of. This was tough as I haaaate to waste food. Even adding crushed black pepper and Tabasco this just did not have any flavor.   From the looks of it, steak is their bread and butter here. Surrounding tables ordered steak and salads...so maybe I'll consider that next time. Steaks are in the price range of $40-$70. That's just the steak. Then you'd add your sides for an additional cost.   I think Hexx has a great location and b'cuz of the indoor/outdoor experience, this would be a great place to grab appetizers, enjoy a stiff bevie and people watch walking the infamous Las Vegas Strip.",

We were seated for 45 minutes when the manager decided to create a large party table behind our large party. The two tables were so close that neither table could get in or out. Everyone was uncomfortable for the rest of our meal. When brought to the staffs attention they said \"oh we know\". We asked for boxes for our food; they didn't come for 20 more minutes. When we asked for our check we got instant attitude and a snarky \"thanks for your patients\" from the server. He then proceeded to say he was busy. We didn't ask for much and were very polite but yet we were treated poorly. Next weeks brunch will we of the strip and somewhere more local friendly.   P.S. being accommodating is great but not if you can't handle the accommodations.",

However...it started with the hostesses who sat us in the corner when there were seats available elsewhere, when I asked if it was possible to seat elsewhere, in a short curt response, no it's busy tonight and if cane with no reservations this is it. Ok wow! Not even a let me try, needless to say the table remained open for at least 30 minutes while we waited. Service was poor, took us another 30 minutes to get our waiter, ordered a beer twice and twice they came back and said they were out. The recommendation of what they did have sucked and luckily he took it off the tab. Cesar salad was good as was the pizza. Great place to people watch. ,",

Small snafu--server removed our appetizer plates and utensils before our mains arrived and did not replace the utensils. We sat for a couple minutes (eager to eat) but without utensils.  Ambiance: The main dining room gets pretty loud. Considering the number of bachelor/bachelorette groups & unlimited mimosas..I believe it's to be expected.  Overall: Decent casual brunch experience--could be improved by greater attention to food portion and presentation.",

The shrimp cocktail had to be the most fancy presentation I've ever eaten. I liked it a lot! The mushroom risotto however was a bit crunchy and I didn't see or taste any mushrooms in it? It was more like a Parmesan risotto. I tried my friends steak (EVERYONE got steak and it looked even better than my food...I'm just not a steak person I don't eat red meat) and damn that steak was so good! I'll have to come back and get my own for sure! Then we got dessert, their chocolate \"spells\" were cute, but the chocolate wasn't anything to cry home about. However, the peanut butter cheesecake...drool. Think of it as a snickers bar, an Oreo cookie, and a peanut butter cup all in one. But it's not overwhelming. It's a perfect mix. Highly recommend.",

So I was pleasantly surprised to find Brunch till 4 p.m. especially when sometimes in Vegas my husband and I don't start our day till 1 or 2 p.m.  We had the Meat Omelet and the Brioche French Toast and split them so we could have some sweet and savory.  We were very happy with both selections. We did not do the unlimited mimosas this time as we were catching a flight later that afternoon.  Service was great and FAST, surprisingly so since they were quite busy.  It did get a little loud in there, guessing it's because everyone else around us had the mimosas and other cocktails.  We definitely recommend this place and will be back.",

Sean and the gentleman assisting him were always on top of things like questions, drink refills and plate clearing. We had gotten a bottle of champagne that was actually being retired so Sean had us sign it, along with himself, and showed us where they would store it so we could come find it next time we were in town. They have a whole display of signed bottles! Pretty cool experience. We will definitely be back! Thanks again Sean!",

Be forewarned- why I am giving this experience two stars... we had an amazing seat outside right next to the sidewalk on a beautiful day when it was 70 outside. Perfection right? NO!!! There was a HORRIBLE man set up on the sidewalk singing. SO LOUD, my date and I couldnt even hear one another. It absolutely RUINED the entire thing. There are NO WORDS as to how awful this was. We couldnt wait to finish eating and get out. My ears were ringing for an hour afterwards.",

Starting out our sever Steven was amazing a professional enjoyable server, the dirty grey goose martinis were perfect along with out meat and cheese plate to start out with.  Then moved on to and delicious bottle of serra barbaresco 2010 which was delicious! For our entrees I had the shrimp scampi and my boyfriend had the short rib both were fantastic! For sides we had broccoli I really enjoyed my dinner the chef knows what he's doing! To top it off at the end they asked us to sign the bottle to put in up in the ceiling and leave a little of us in Vegas we will let everyone know about this place! Thank you everyone at HEXX",

    "text": "We decided to do a nice dinner on our last night in Vegas at Hexx. I was browsing the groupon deals earlier in the day and I had seen a deal for Hexx. The menu looked pretty good so when it was closer to dinner time, I bought the groupon and we decided to check it out.  It was about 9pm and we were able to sit outside on the patio overlooking the fountains which was nice. Soon after seating the waiter took our drink order and I asked about how I go about applying the groupon. He then told me just to show him my phone when we get our bill. Okay. No problem. But then he goes on to tell me it has to be more than 4 hours since buying the groupon. Well I had maybe bought it about 1-2 hours prior to dinner.  It wasn't a new groupon that had rolled out that same day or anything. I read all the fine print prior to purchasing any groupon out of habit and nowhere does it read that it must be 4 hours before I can use it. I conveyed this information to the waiter who then proceeds to tell me \"Oh, I'm SURE it's on there.\" So at this point I'm a little frustrated/annoyed. I reread the fine print. I was then told it wasn't their policy but groupon's policy. So I was thinking \"hmm that's weird\" because earlier in the day we purchased the groupon for the Eiffel Tower experience literally 5 min before walking up without issues. And when I read groupon faq's, all it reads is \"most Groupons can be used right after purchase, up until the expiration date, but may not be combined with other specials or promos\". Again, I was told this 4 hour clause had to be on the site. We'd been walking around all day. We were hungry. So not wanting to wait the 3 hours more, we decided to leave.  I figure since the waiter wasn't very empathetic and guaranteed I had somehow misread the fine print, that I would ask the lady at the door. She told me they had apparently just had a meeting on groupons and this is the information that they had been told but that she would ask a manager for us. To make this part short, the manager came out (who was definitely more understanding) and scanned our groupon and it amazingly worked within maybe an hour and a half of being purchased... Lol. All that trouble?   We were seated back at the same table. It was shift change and we had a super nice waitress (wish I could remember her name). We ordered and everything went pretty smoothly from there on out. We had the spinach and artichoke dip which was about average. I had the shrimp scampi which was pretty good. They were more generous with their shrimp than I was expecting. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and ate everything on his plate so I'm assuming he enjoyed his food. His plate was also a decent portion size. He originally ordered the jambalaya and although it was good it was way too spicy for him to eat comfortably. I did feel the food was a little overpriced for the quality but it IS Vegas.   I am glad we had a groupon though. But, I guess I wouldn't have been so put off by the initial service if I didn't have a groupon.   Just be aware and buy your groupon well in advance y'all. It will save you the hassle.",

I love that peppers and lemon were also fried  and served with the seafood and the dipping sauce was amazing.  So much flavor!!  My kids ordered the pizza's and they loved them.  My husband and I both ordered a rib eye and it was absolutely perfectly grilled, juicy and flavorful.  The Yukon gold potatoes were crispy on the outside, creamy inside and perfectly seasoned.  It was a great meal with an awesome view of the Bellagio water show and an attentive and friendly staff.",

    "text": "What's telling about any business is not how it acts when things go as planned; but how it responds when it drops the ball.  Hexx gets a F in this regard.  When I made my reservation that same morning, Hexx said it offered complimentary valet parking for its guests.  When I arrived, the valet said Hexx hadn't updated its website and I would owe $13. After placing my order, I showed the manager on my phone his restaurant's offer and he incorrectly told me that was between me and the hotel.    As a courtesy to him, I called the hotel.  The hotel's response was, appropriately, that the offer was between the restaurant and me. Again, I asked to speak to the manager and told him that the hotel was correct when it said the restaurant was responsible for honoring its contract, and I would deduct the $13 from payment.  He said he would review the listing to see if had any outs such as \"subject to change without notice.\" Seriously!? I couldn't make this up.   Is that really intended for a situation where the restaurant changes its parking policy 45-minutes after someone makes a reservation because of its parking policy?   Sure, if the website had adequate disclaimers, it may have the right to respond \"screw you,\" or similar, to its guests if it would like to.  However, disclaimers are not intended for when less than hour passes between a quoted price and someone accepting it (the stock market excluded).  The waiter returned with a $13 credit on my check since the manager wasn't able to find \"subject to change without notice.\"   ***Note to all restaurateurs: if 45 minutes earlier your website stated a cheaper price for anything (corkage, parking, menu items), and someone makes a decision to dine at your restaurant based on that and comes directly to your restaurant, honor the information on your website.***  An appropriate response would be, \"Thank for letting us know.  We'll update our website and, of course, honor that price this time.\" Any other response serves as litmus test for anyone \"serving\" at your restaurant.  The food was good but the music was too loud for casual conversation.  Fortunately, I was dining solo.  If I had a guest, I would have found it challenging to converse.  For that reason, and my not needing to assume the risk for any restaurant's mistakes, I would not return.  I have to give 1-star for value because paying for valet parking almost doubles the cost of breakfast for a regular, solo diner.  I suspect using the free parking may make going there take too much time for the everyday diner on his lunch break.  My server, Julio, was great.  The service score reflects my overall experience which, even a truly service-oriented server like Julio, can't overcome significant mishaps from management.",

The first time we had an awesome server who was knowledgeable, on top of everything and we really enjoyed him. The second time we had a different guy and he was awful. He barely greeted us, messed up my friends order and took  forever to get us our drinks, our food, our check, you name it. Too bad because I do like the ambiance here, it is trendy and touristy but also casual. Nice place to go on a date or bring your friends after a night out on the strip.  My favorite things to eat here are the smothered fries, which are normal fries but with cheese, pulled pork and BBQ sauce on top. They were amazing both times I had them. There are more then large enough for one person, or good for multiple people to share. I have also had the hummus here which is different. The chickpeas are not smashed, they are whole and so the hummus us not smooth as one might expect. Still good thought I thought.  Their drinks and chocolates are for sure their top items around here. Their chocolate tastes very different from the normal ones we know in the food store but if you love chocolate or are adventurous then why not try it out? The chocolate reminds me of strong dark chocolate, supposedly with no chemicals or preservatives and man can you taste the difference! I personally didn't like it, but my friends did. Worth a try for sure since they bring some samples around at the end of your meal. Their alcoholic drinks are also worth a try- if you come during the day make sure to look out for their happy hour or drink specials and save yourself a few bucks.",

For a casual restaurant the ambience is definitely upscale.  I got the meat omelette and parfait.  The highlight of the meal was the home fries... so good.  The omelette was ok, just too much meat for me and maybe a little over cooked.  But that's just my personal taste, a meat lover would probably love it.  I'd probably try one of the other ones next time.  The yogurt parfait was delish with fresh berries, as was the jam.  Portion sizes are huge and I couldn't even finish my plate.

Hexx is a crazy name for a Las Vegas strip restaurant anyway so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch.   You're basically paying to sit mid-strip at an okay restaurant. The quality of the dishes does not measure up to the prices charged. $36 for a basic cocktail with Malibu and pineapple, LOL.   I tried some of their $25 burger on a white chocolate bun, it was pretty good but not $25 good. Would have rather had In & Out. Their fries are decent. My son had the margherita pizza, it was pretty good. I also tried their pappardelle  pasta, this is where they failed completely. The noodles were so overcooked that they all stuck together in a gelatinous  blob. Too bad because the sauce and mushrooms were pretty good.  The worst part was the hostess at the Paris entrance was immature and rude. Also, they told us we would have a 15-minute wait and it ended up being 45 minutes. Our waitress was okay but it took a while to get a menu and our drinks.   I was very underwhelmed.",

We had a later reservation and they accommodated us when we got to the area much earlier than expected but it wasn't too busy at 5pm. Our server Teddy was awesome! He made personal menu suggestions that didn't sound forced and was quick with refills and removing empty dishes. We ordered the hummus with pita chips and a margherita pizza and both were really delicious and didn't feel heavy- everything tasted fresh. Husband had a beer and I had the Hypnotizing Strawberry specialty drink, which was blended well. The server even acknowledged our anniversary, which was mentioned when we made our reservation weeks prior so that was a nice touch. Some of the best food and drinks we had in Vegas on this trip for sure. We will return again!   **i did post this review on other sites as well",

    "text": "I came here for dinner from a Groupon deal and now that I'm looking at reviews , I think coming for breakfast/brunch is a better option. The setting is nice and open. Perfect for summer. They keep it cool or if you want to sit outside they have a good amount of misters. Service is excellent. They're very attentive. Every time you use a utensil they immediately bring a new one. I thought this was interesting because I haven't seen that anywhere else! I always have to ask lol For an appetizer we had spinach dip, a meat and cheese deli type plate, and shrimp cocktail. The only one worth mentioning is the spinach dip. Very delicious and I loved that it was served with bread AND chips. For the main dish I had short rib which is one of their signature items. It is served with mash potatoes and brussel sprouts. The short rib itself was delicious, however the dish was ruined by the horse radish mashed potatoes. The other member of my family who ordered the same dish had a similar hate for those. The horseradish completely ruined the taste of perfectly good mashed potatoes and it was inedible for everyone at the table. If only they put garlic or something else, because the taste was so overbearing . Other members of the group ordered different steaks which were all cooked to their liking . The only complaint was that you had to pay for a side dish. Otherwise you just get a steak with a tiny topping of peppers or some other small assortment. But definitely two bites at most. Not enough for a side dish and not enough to fill anybody up. For dessert we had a brownie sundae, cookie sundae, and some sort of flan. The flan was overly soft and couldn't be picked up by a fork. It was pretty liquidy. The brownie was very rich but not very good. The only good part was the ice cream with toffee in it. The cookie sundae was hug but I was disappointed to find that the taste and texture were more like a muffin than a cookie. I kept retasting it to see what was so weird about it,you but I didn't enjoy it. None of the desserts we tried were worth it. Overall it was a good deal for what we paid but I definitely wouldn't come back.",

Every time I've gone, the service has been excellent. We are usually greeted quickly & with smiles. The staff is great & their food/drink recommendations are always on point. The food amazing! The flavors are so well combined, and so flavorful.   Tonight my friend and I had the Working Husband & the El Nino drinks. Both were highly recommended, and they did not disappoint. The Working Husband was a perfect balance of sweet & spicy, which was just right for me. The El Nino was delicious. If you like Moscow mules then you would enjoy this drink. I was a little skeptical about the ginger beer they use for the mix, but when I actually gave it a taste, it was amazing.   As far as the inside space, they have plenty of seating. The indoor seating is beautiful. Big open space, with lots of lighting, and looks quite fancy. The outdoor seating also has enough seating. You have the front view of the bellagio fountains. It could get a bit loud when you're seating outdoors, because of all the pedestrian activity and traffic on the strip. I don't mi d it at all though. It's actually quite entertaining, watching all the people passing by.   As far as food, my friend had the Halibut which was sooooooo delicious. It comes served on top of this amazing risotto. Such a beautiful fusion of flavors. In this risotto you can taste hints of curry, and coconut, and different spices. So well paired, balanced & made to perfection. I had the butter lettuce and I loved it. The Cocoa Nibs took that salad to a whole other level. It was delicious. We also had the spinach dip which was also amazing. The spinach dip comes with these toasted flattened bagel chips for the dip which were so good. And the dip itself full of flavor. We also had the spicy roasted cauliflower, which was super tasty. It was cooked just right, and extra crunch from the toasted almonds kicked it up a knoch. I also had a mushroom risotto which was also very delicious. I'm obsessed with garlic, so the fact that I could actually taste the garlic in this dish, made my night. Now for dessert we had the passion fruit mouse cake which was to die for. This is a must have item on the dessert menu. It's so light and airy yet full of flavor.   Overall, all I can say is that this place is truly amazing. The chef really knows his stuff. And the staff is excellent. I will continue coming here and referring all my friends to this place!",

We got the bottomless mimosas that happen to be real mimosas (aka champagne w/ a splash of OJ), the carrot cake pancakes which I 100% recommend if you like carrot cake, and I got a made to order omelets. I got a spinach, mushroom, bacon, and light cheese omelette that came with a side of garlic country potatoes and a biscuit. The garlic potatoes tasted like the garlic fries at AT&T park in SF.",

Our waiter greeted us with a friendly, warm smile, and got to filling our water glasses and drink orders on the spot.  We enjoyed the Traditional Caesar and Simple Salads to start. The Caesar was large enough for two of us to share, while the Simple Salad was just about the prettiest salad that I'd ever seen! Time and care from the kitchen was obviously present.   One of us ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie appetizer as a meal, and was not disappointed! Again, the presentation was inspired! Two of us shared the Pappardelle, and were still unable to finish everything! If you love mushrooms, these wild mushrooms will not disappoint! However, the person who ordered the Hexx burger went back and forth between bites of the burger and oohs and aahs! After having a burger the other day at Gordon Ramsay's Burger, he stated that the two were incomparable!   Finally, watching the Bellagio Fountains as we people-watched, our experience couldn't be matched! Next time we'll have to save room for that Butterscotch Creme Brulee!",

No big deal though because its a restaurant and we know they cant kick people out to give us a table, especially not when there are bottomless mimosas. Speaking of $23 for bottomless mimosas is not bad. Especially when we had about 7 each. Our waiter was less than helpful but there was another waiter near by who helped us several times and he even refilled our drinks for us!  The food was delicious and portions were more than generous!",

I had seen an interesting advertisement outside by their doors showcasing what looked like sangria pitchers with what looked like dry ice making fog rise from the pitchers. I thought it would be interesting to try so I came back with my wife to experience that. Since we were not going to eat the hostess sent us to the bar. We sat there for literally no joke about ten minutes and no one acknowledged us at all. We weren't complaining because we aren't jerks or assholes we understand that the staff might be busy with other guests but it was about 3pm and there was five people scattered throughout the bar and there was three bartenders. It wasn't until one of them needed to use the register that was next to where we were sitting that I had the opportunity to ask for service asm he replied that he needed to take care of the two ladies sitting three stools away. Horrible service. Horrible service. Maybe he was being racist? Maybe he was being discriminate? Maybe he doesn't belong in the service industry? The reason I bring up the race card? My wife and I are Hispanic. The rest of the patrons were anglos. That was my observation. Why bring up the discrimination? Maybe because he saw that we were Hispanic, he assumed we were going to be rude or maybe even be bad tippers? I work in services as well, my bonuses are directly from client feedback through what my company calls net promotor score. If I meet my metrics I get a bonus. If a server or bartender gives good service or even great service they should assume a great tip. I tip 20% regardless because I understand the service industry. This person, with grayish short hair wearing a blue striped long sleeve shirt didn't even give us the opportunity to pay for a good from this establishment much Lee's tip him. He seemed like he had more authority than the bartenders so he might be a manager or whatever maybe he felt like he can choose his patrons. Been in Vegas before to many establishments and this was the worst ever. Couldn't even comment on their product or food cause I couldn't even try it...",

    "text": "I expect restaurants on the strip to be overpriced, but to generally have excellent food.  Hexx unfortunately did not have excellent food.   I ordered \"Grilled King Salmon.  manhattan clam chowder, arugula salad.\"  The 'clam chowder' consisted of several clams in open shells, and a little bit of liquid in the bottom of the plate, with small pieces of vegetable.  At first I thought it was just liquid from the salmon, which was in the middle of the plate.  The 'arugula salad' was really more of a garnish on top of the salmon.  The most disappointing part was that the salmon wasn't cooked through. The half that was cooked was good, the rest was orange/pink jello.  I declined the offer of another piece of salmon, since I was ready to leave by that point.    My dinner companion ordered the New York steak, 10oz, which looked small for 10oz.  The blue cheese butter was specifically asked to be left off the steak, but it arrived with it anyway.  The second steak that came out, this time without the butter and about whenI finished the cooked part of my meal, apparently was good.  Cost, without tip, for both meals, one soda, and two glasses of water, was just over $80.  The service was OK, with several apologies, and the view of the fountain was nice, but I would not go back again.",

Our experienced started with being \"greeted\" by an unfriendly front desk host.  She wasnt rude but definitely did not put off a welcoming or friendly vibe....  as the host its your job to atleast crack a smile. I ordered the chicken and waffles... The chicken was a big disappointment.  It had an odd texture and taste and dry in the inside.  It tasted like it was either some pre-breaded cafeteria style chicken or maybe even some generic shake and bake chicken. I didnt mind the cheddar waffle, i think that worked except some of the bites with the apple gave off an odd apple taste.  I think it was from the apple skin that they may have left on. I think the chicken and waffles from Grand Lux destroys this and they cost nearly half as much. My wife had a steak and it lacked the rich beef flavor of what a quality steak would have.  She said she would prefer a cheapy sirloin steak from Sizzler over what she ate.",

I made reservations and when we showed up, they said they had no record of it. Okay fine maybe something fell through. We waited an hour to sit then ordered. The 6 of us all ordered various steaks and thought all was good. 45 minutes later and still no food I called the manager over. He assured me they would be out soon, but took an additional 15-20 minutes until 5 of the 6 meals came out, all cold. One of the steaks was never put in! After talking AGAIN to the manager, he offered to reheat our food and comp the one which was not put in. We declined since we had obligations already set up for about 20 minutes from then. Finally the last steak came out and by that time we had to eat in a rush and get out of there. During that whole time parties around us came, sat, ordered, ate, and left before we ever got our food. The whole dinner took about 1 hour 45 min, not including the unexpected hour wait. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone looking for a night out dinner with friends. The terrible customer service mixed with the cold food served to us gives me the rational for the 1 star rating.",

    "text": "We dined at Hexx last night and were blown away! Great staff from Parish, the host, who was so accommodating and polite  (and adorable with his bow tie) to our server Maria (knowledgeable, engaging, attentive) to the chefs who have outdone themselves with the menu....we tried a little bit of a LOT OF stuff and while everything was tasty and beautifully presented, a few things stood out: the broccolini. Really. It's an appetizer and we all thought, \"huh?\" because who wants to eat a plate of that stuff before a nice meal?! But it's delicious! I can't even describe it---some kind of marinade happened and then I think it's fried. ....what you get is the lightest, most delicious thing you never expected! Other standouts: the meatballs, the artichoke dip, the BACON! For entrees, the New York strip was melt in your mouth even better than the Filet. Chicken and waffles? An unlikely dinner option that turned out to be a great choice. The jumbalaya was generous with the shrimp and chicken and not too spicy, the burgers were excellent. We also had a sampling of desserts and my favorite was the French silk tart. Hexx seems to pride themselves on high quality local foods and it shows.  Because of the size of our party (9), we were seated at a long table with upholstered booth on one side and chairs on the other. I was so pleasantly surprised by the throw pillows which were decorative and great back support!  Get the right spot and you can see the Bellagio fountains while you dine. Though the restaurant was busy, we never felt rushed AND we were lucky enough to get a tour of the chocolate making facility (bean to bar) after we finished our meal. Fascinating and I highly recommend if you get the chance. We have eaten our way through a lot of Vegas and Hexx is the place that stood out as best quality and most memorable. Thanks for the tremendous experience.",

    "text": "At first I was sad to see sugar factory left, but now I don't mind that it's gone now that hexx took its place. My man and I went here for dinner on the Fourth of July and were not disappointed. The prices are a bit steep but it is Vegas and you're at a fancy restaurant on the strip so it is expected. Our waitress was Sheri. If you can request her, do it! She is the best waitress we've had in Vegas so far and this is our 4th trip here together. She is very polite, knowledgable, and intelligent about the menu, the ingredients used, and the Vegas strip in general. We asked her a good place to get sushi and she was knowledgable about locations on the strip as well! We shared the chips and dip to start. It was delicious! I love onion dip. You could tell the chips and the dip were homemade and not from a package! We then shared the pepperoni pizza. Also delicious! It's not your boring old pizza, it is thin crust with a sauce that has a slight kick. Onion, garlic and cheese. Mmmm. The pepperoni on it were huge. We at first were just looking for something small to split since we wanted sushi later but the food and service was so good we decided to get dessert too. Sheri recommended to Aztec cake so we tried that! We had it with some coffees. It was very good. The boyfriend liked it even though he isn't big on chocolate stuff. It's a light and soft cake that has an excellent chocolate flavor. We devoured the whole thing. The other desserts looked great too. Next time I'd probably go for the espresso torte, just because it sounds so good! I'd definitely order the Aztec cake again too though! The coffee was very strong so I had to doctor it up a little with sugar and cream. It's definitely a dark roast but the flavor is still good. If you like a strong, dark cup of coffee, I definitely recommend to get one here for breakfast or dessert!  Hexx is a must try if you are someone who loves to try different restaurants in Vegas! If you can get Sheri for a waitress, it'll make your experience even better! I love sparkling water, I ordered that and every time I even thought about pouring more into my glass from the bottle at the table, she was already there pouring it for me! With dessert she brought us 2 complimentary pieces of chocolate that paired nicely with our cake and coffee. She was very knowledgable about the chocolate as well!!",

So impressed at the level of service and the attention to detail and presentation with the food! Unbeatable for the cost, truly blew us away so we came back the next morning for brunch.... Tracee was our server and she recommended the chicken and waffles so my husband got that and I ordered a omelette. My food was so so good until I tried the chicken and waffles and then pushed my plate aside to eat half my husbands breakfast! We have already made brunch reservations for mother's day, there is no where else I would rather eat!",

    "text": "This place took over the sugar factory so I was quite confused when I got there. My group wanted to get the fish bowls from sugar factory. We weren't going to go in until one of the hostesses outside explained that they just opened and that they also had a fishbowl type drink that uses fresh fruit instead of candy. We decided to give it a try and if you don't want to eat you can go directly to the bar. There were some long tables in that area too so we didn't have anywhere to stand or sit when we first went in. There were some tables alongside the glass wall when you first turn in but we didn't know if we could sit there. No one asked or assisted us so we just sat there. Those two tables were not really in the bar's line of sight so no one came to give us a menu or anything. I ended up walking up to the bar to order drinks. I stood there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be helped while the bartenders just passed me by. I finally flagged one of them down (Apparently they won't come to you unless you actually wave at them). I ordered two big fruit martinis (peach raspberry and mango orange). When they were brought to the table we asked for 2 more straws ( we had 4 people). They never brought them so one of my friends had to go back to the bar to get some.  The mango orange one was really sweet but I enjoyed the peach raspberry. It had a peach sake/soju cocktail flavor. They had a good amount of alcohol in them too.  Our bartender came to tell us how much it was and didn't give us a check...just an amount.  This place just opened so hopefully they'll make some changes.",

I ask all the lobster and left the roll.  3- The chicken and waffles- waffle was tasty, the chicken was well marinated, but there were some \"black spots\" of burnt coating.  4-The pasta- pasta was cool perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  5- Farmers Bloody Mary- was good and had a kick",

    "text": "We wanted to celebrate a special occasion with my daughter and her family. And we wanted to try a place that none of us had eaten previously. Hexx Kitchen for brunch on a pleasant June morning seemed to fit the bill. Ambiance: We got a table on the patio with a good view of the Bellagio fountains and for people watching. A good start for the meal. They did have misters going to help with the heat but they were spraying out so it did little to cool down those of us sitting on the patio. Service: Our server came by a few minutes after we sat down. She was very warm and welcoming. She then disappeared for about 10 minutes. No problem - we needed time to work out menu options. When she returned, she took our order and disappeared again. No problem - family time and we liked the chance to talk. The food runners eventually did bring our food, but getting water or coffee refills required tripping a busboy for another table to get attention. Yes, the servers are spread thin. And working hard. But that shouldn't be my problem. And not an excuse for poor service. They should have more servers working Sunday brunch.  Food: My wife and I shared the brioche French toast and the meat omelet. Each was brought out room temperature. The French toast was about the same quality you can get at IHOP or Denny's. That's not a serious criticism about the flavor - eat on the Strip and you pay Strip prices for a meal. The omelet was tasty, not great but good. It came with potatoes that probably were good when they were hot. Being generous, I could see giving the food a 3 star rating. Value: Eating on a patio on the Strip should be worth something, even if the food and service are disappointing. But the final \"straw\" for me was on the bill. They added a 4% surcharge item labeled \"cnf.\" When I asked about it, I was told it is an added fee because the restaurant has to pay the hotel for the location attached to the Paris. GIVE ME A BREAK! Charge more for the food on the menu if you need to cover your overhead. But don't slip it in on the bill and hope that no one notices.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "My family and I decided to come to Las Vegas for the long weekend. We all came with our family. I found Hexx on yelp and I thought it would be a good restaurant for kids and adults. I called 3 days prior to make the reservation. We were a party of 22. Our reservation was at 11:15am and we were seated at about 11:45am because they were trying to get a table to accommodate our party. They were unable to get us a table so our party was split in half. We had four infants in our party that needed a highchair. We were told that all of their highchairs were being used, but as soon as they became available they would bring them to our table. Everybody loved the food but it was very uncomfortable to eat with the infants on our laps. While we were eating another party was seated next to us. They had an infant and they were given a highchair as soon as they got seated. My husband and I were very disappointed. How can another party get priority? The guys got a round of Schonramer gold beer and they wanted a second round but were told that they ran out of that beer. Seriously?! How can that be possible? I really wanted to try the carrot cake pancakes but I am allergic to walnuts so I opted for the cinnaroll waffle. It was okay. My sister in law had the chilaquiles, they were delicious. The girls an I had the bottomless mimosas for $25. Bottomless for a period of two hours. We had a great time but it could have been better. This is why I give them three stars.",

    "text": "Review long overdue!!!!  I rarely give any place a 5 star, but I would admit this place has earned it.  We were in LV for my wife's B-day and wanted a nice parting dinner.  we bought a Travelzoo special; dinner for 2 includes 2 cocktails, it was an excellent value.  My wife ordered the scallops and they were perfect, not overly seasoned.  I had the braised ribs, it was absolutely delicious; I devoured it despite not being hungry. To say the least, the food was outstanding.  But the reason why the 5th star:  1) We were seated outside along the strip along side the strip to people watch, the Bellagio water show, and perfect weather. 2) Marie, our server; she was absolutely wonderful and took great care of our experience.  She took the time to make sure our couple photo captured our special meal and timing it with the water show to ensure an amazing back drop...big thanks Marie.  And she deserve a huge bonus...hint..hint. 3) Timing - it was my wife's birthday; this last meal and experience just made it so much more special.  Note: Many restaurant has a tendency to treat their guess negatively different when they are using a Travelzoo/Groupon special.   HEXX was professional and courteous throughout our experience.  I will add this restaurant to our list to return and to entertain at.  Thanks HEXX",

We ordered the carrot cake pancakes (please believe the hype and get them.  Amazing recipe, not sickeningly sweet, spiced appropriately, shredded carrots in the batter), the cinaroll waffle (which was also great but my party preferred the pancakes) and the turkey club.  Go if only for the carrot cake pancakes.  But if you go, I don't think you'll regret it.",

I sent it back and asked for medium rare again. Another 30 minutes goes by and the whole table was finished eating by then, the steak comes out again, it is so rare it's comical. The waiter had the audacity to call ME out and say \"so you wanted it medium?\" I said \"No I want it medium rare just like my friends ordered it and got it\". Another 45 minuets go by and I still don't have my steak, I told the manager I didn't want it any more. For the first time in about 2+ hours were our bottomless mimosas filled without us asking. They are called bottomless so we don't have to see the bottom of the glass. They blamed their lack of attention to your table on being busy, when there was clearly 20 Empty tables around us. If I could give it a -5 stars I would. Never going back!!!!",

I had the meat omelet and substituted the pork for tomatoes. It came out nice and toasty, and was accompanied by hot and crispy hash browns and an English muffin.  It was a much needed breakfast pick me up and our server was kind and very attentive. When I am in Vegas again, I would definitely come back and have a meal here!

The bottomless mimosas were great as well and worth the $23. Don't be surprised if it takes a little time to get your food and drinks: they're busy for a reason!

First off my friend was previously here for his girlfriends birthday and it happened to be when the Paris hotel had a complete loss of power. So due to that situation the manager informed him that the next time he made a reservation at the restaurant it would be taken care of. So for his birthday he made a reservation and informed the person on the phone that he would be bringing a small group for a dinner and that the manager should be informed since it was going to be taken care of due to the previous incident. The person on the phone confirmed it with the manager and the reservation was set. We came for the reservation and ate our dinner but when the bill came we were all shocked that suddenly the dinner would not be taken care of. They claimed that they never said they would be taking care of the dinner and even went as far as calling security to watch all of us to ensure the bill would be paid. Horrible customer service and very hostile manager. Lied to us about a wonderful dinner to make up for their wrongs. Very disrespectful calling security on us when we were not hostile towards the staff. I would highly recommended you not eat at this establishment. Not worth your time or money. They ruined our night.",

The menu is delicious, approachable, while still being creative. Everyone from the hostess to the management was great too. The General Manager stopped by our table; he was extremely nice and hospitable. Our server was super knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive. She was eager to answer all of our questions and recommended some tasty cocktails. The Potions are fantastic and the wine list is extensive.   We can't wait to return for more cocktails and to try their \"bean to bar\"chocolate. Thanks again to Michael and the Hexx staff!",

We asked to be seated outside the 3-4 waiters outside failed to notice us and we didn't even get asked for a glass of water for 10 Minutes. This lead to us to change our seating arrangement and we moved inside WHERE WE HAD THE BEST WAITRESS EVER MISS MAGGIE!!!!!!! She made our experience wonderful after an unpleasant start. GREATEST WAITRESS IN VEGAS. Now about the food it was AMAZING! We had the chicken and waffles and steak and eggs they both were cooked to perfection and the Bottomless Mimosas were spot on. Definitely the best brunch spot in Las Vegas. If you get the chance stop by, ask for Maggie she will make your brunch even better with her amazing personality and great conversation.",

Everything here is just gorgeous. It was so hard to pick out a food item as everything on the menu, and everything that went past, looked awesome. Our service was prompt and attentive without being pushy or rushing us, as well as being helpful with the menu for some dietary concerns. I think this is an absolute go-to in Vegas.",

That's how juicy and fine the texture was. Huge serving, so be prepared to take it to go. I also ordered the HEXX Cauldron which was delicious! I'm so glad my sister & I were warned to take our time drinking it, you can't taste the alcohol so it definitely creeps up on you. Plus it's served in this cool champagne colored disco ball.

    "text": "Reservations: I made reservations here weeks or months in advance for my anniversary weekend trip to Las Vegas with my husband. I even updated my reservation on the day of to be pushed back half an hour to accommodate our schedule, and there was no problem via the OpenTable app.   Getting there: It's inside the Paris Hotel and Casino. There are some signs pointing to the various establishments inside, but we were still a bit confused/lost for the first five minutes. We checked in at the front desk and were instructed to walk down the hallway to the other side of the restaurant to be seated. We simply followed the party in front of us, toward where the crowd of people and the noise seemed to be originating. Some signs leading the way would have been helpful. The restaurant is actually Alexxa's, since we got a menu for Alexxa's when we sat down. The entrance to Alexxa's is accessible from the main strip boulevard.  Seating: As we arrived at the entrance area to Alexxa's from the front desk of Hexx, a hostess was calling my name from the reservation. Fortunately, I heard her and saw her looking for me, so I quickly walked up to her and identified myself. There were A LOT of other parties waiting to be seated, most likely without reservations. So, to reiterate, make a reservation to avoid the wait. We were seated in the patio area, but not right next to the railing, so this was nice for people watching without the people watching us back as they passed. There was easy access to take unobstructed photos of the Bellagio and the Strip.   Food: I ordered the chilaquiles and my husband ordered the meat omelet. He also ordered the blueberry mule. The blueberry mule was delicious! I should get into mules more.  I liked the chilaquiles, but as other reviewers have noted, the tortilla chips were indeed soft or soggy. Perhaps it's meant to be that way. My husband loved his meat omelet, and raved about the potatoes so much that I stole half of them. My chilaquiles were a bit spicy, so he let me have half his biscuit, which came with soft butter and strawberry jam.    Service: Our waiter was good and checked in on us twice after our food was delivered. It took a while after our plates were cleared to get our check, and that was only because he was preparing our complimentary chocolate ice cream cupcake to celebrate our anniversary. I was actually a bit annoyed with how slow the service seemed to be until he arrived with our dessert. We were very thankful for this kind gesture.   Payment: Quick and easy.   Overall: I recommend this place for brunch. Make reservations and make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy your meal, as service can be slow.",

It was perfect because we had just arrived in Vegas and checked into our hotel and wanted something to drink and eat.   The drink prices were great and there were still a lot of choices! You just have to sit at the bar for happy hours, so you can't sit outside. You also only can order food from the starters and pizzas, but food is 20% off! I loved the two drinks I got: the blueberry cocktail and the bartender's infusion. Both were extremely fancy cocktails I wouldn't usually expect at happy hour!",

Needed some salt but the texture was perfect.  Chicken and waffles was great! The chicken was moist. It was a just a bit too expensive - $24. I had the steak and eggs. It was just that. Nothing worth mentioning besides it was $25. We had two other people on our party and they loved their food. One got Hexx benedict and another got the farm fresh eggs.

    "text": "HEXX is really underrated!  It is seriously good!  It is one of the better restaurants at this price point in Las Vegas.  It is a not just a good, but a great value.  You can usually find a discount to Hexx, and so it is always a good value for Las Vegas.  The view also can't be beat!  You can sit outside if you want, but even from the inside you have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains!!  This time we tried the Cheesy Garlic Bread and it was good, but next time I would try something else.  I had the Filet with Creamed Corn, and I seriously think the Creamed Corn at Hexx is the best I have ever had anywhere!!!  I love it!!  I have also had the Ribeye before, and it was also very good.  The Veal Milanese was huge!!  It was also really, really great.  The Smore's dessert was ok.  I have had the Tiramisu there in the past and that is amazing!  They make it right in front of you with a funky contraption!  So go for the Tiramisu and not the Smore's dessert, you will thank me later.  If you want some really good food with a really good view at a great price go to Hexx.  I try to go there every time I go to Vegas now.  I need to try Brunch next!!",

However, our waitress for the day, Tracy was so sweet that she kept pouring mimosas for us although we were way past the cut off time.   The food was amazing. I had a veggie burger with fries. The burger was excellent. The veggie patty and avocado which came with it was too good (absolutely no words to describe).   My husband however didn't like what he ordered. He ordered for a veggie omelette and looks like they had made the omelette using a cheap version of some oil or they probably used the non-veg oil to make it. It was horrible that he threw away most of it. However the mashed potatoes he got along with it was tasty!  This is a must visit restaurant for an amazing brunch with bottomless mimosas and if the food is not good, you can always tell them and ask them to change it.",

With 4 out of 5 stars and over 1,000 reviews I expected way more.   It only took about 10 minutes for us to get seated, but over an hour for the four of us to receive our food! The service was very slow and the waitress was very forgetful. We had to literally ask them what was taking so long with our food.... then 10 minutes later we got our order. A group of 10 girls got seated 30 minutes after us and got all their food at the same time we got ours!  Also, we did not order bottomless mimosas, but we still expect our beverages to be refilled every now and then.  I wanted to give only one star for the awful service, but gave two because the food was pretty good. The Hexx benedict was okay (I've had better eggs benedict) but the burgers were good and the carrot cake pancakes were super yum!    All in all, I probably won't be going back. Not impressed. We arrived at 1pm and left at 3pm. It shouldn't take that long to get lunch.",

My wife discovered the joys of Hexx thanks to Eggs Benedict ($16) with Scalloped Potatoes, Canadian Bacon, and Asparagus. Known as Hexx Benedict, it's a filling meaty combo featuring a pair of big white spheres oozing a tangy sauce.   For me, the Apple Cheddar Waffle and Fried Chicken breakfast ($24) was the perfect afternoon delight of Hexxual satisfaction even though neither was the best I've ever had. It turns out there's no such thing as bad Hexx.  Open 6:00 a.m. to midnight, Hexx is like sleep in Vegas ... you never can get enough ... whether it is Hexx in the morning, Hexx in the afternoon, or Hexx in the evening.",

    "text": "I passed Hexx many, many times while on the Vegas strip and every time, the patio is full with a line out the door. Finally decided to give Hexx a try for brunch and I was surprised at how great the food and friendly the service was there.  I made a reservation for two via Yelp and upon arriving to the restaurant we were seated within five minutes. We got a seat under the awning by the patio, our waitress greeted and got our orders placed quickly.  We got the Hexx Benedict, Chilaquiles and Carrot Cake Pancakes. Everything came out at a timely manner and both brunch entrees were tasty. The Carrot Cake Pancakes were probably my favorite. It came with four fluffy stacks with a dollop of cream cheese and sprinkled with chopped pecans.   Hexx is the perfect location for brunch and will be coming back to try other dishes. If you're lucky to get a spot on the patio, you'll get a great view of the Bellagio and maybe even a water show. Highly recommend getting reservations!",

If you plan on going and want to sit outside it will be at least a 20-30 minute wait!  What we ordered:  Sticky bun, my favorite part of breakfast. Had a cream cheese filling that was sooo good! Must get this to start if you have a sweet tooth.  Eggs Benedict- also so good. Instead of having an English muffin it had a cheese potato on the bottom that was perfect. I'm an eggs Benedict snob and this place did not disappoint! Must try this one too! :)  Carrot cake pancakes - also really good but was kind of full when we got to these. If I had to choose I'd still get the sticky bun over these pancakes.",

For my appetizer, I ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was fresh and tasty!  Followed by the 8 oz filet medium rare.  The steak was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth delicious!    We had reservations that were early enough that we had the option to dine inside or outside, but the day we ate at HEXX, it was 107 degrees outside, so too hot to eat on the patio.

I split their shrimp salad and it was so delicious! Tried my friends potatoes which were also amazing and their chilaquiles, wow! Highly recommend the chilaquiles. Also tried their sausage, egg & bacon pizza and surprisingly lived it. Plus there was plenty to take back to the hotel!   Overall, definitely recommend.

Our server was very polite and did everything possible to accommodate us until food comes. When the food finally came it was delicious. We asked for the check and when he brought us the check he said that they restaurant gave us discount because our food was late.

    "text": "3.75 stars  Popped in to HEXX for brunch, and it was enjoyable though nothing overwhelmingly special. We were fortunate to get a table pretty quickly on a Sunday afternoon, and we admittedly were in a bit of a rush because my sister-in-law had to catch a flight within a few hours. But they were willing to take us and we were staying in that very hotel, so it made for an easy and convenient option.   The service was fine but could have been better; the staff clearly had a lot on their plates, and while they were friendly, they were probably a bit stretched. There was a bit of a miscommunication regarding my sister-in-law's meal that resulted in her missing out on an ingredient that was supposed to be included in her dish (chilaquiles) and that she had really wanted, but ended up not getting due to the mix-up.   Otherwise, the food was definitely solid. I ordered the veggie omelette and it was quite enjoyable, with good depth of flavor. Sides included potatoes, which were fine, and an english muffin, which actually had an unusual but interesting texture. The meal certainly filled me up for a good chunk of the day, so that was appreciated. My husband ordered the veggie burger, and I was impressed to see that they made their own. While it did not hold up well in terms of composition (as in it fell apart easily and ended up being eaten with a fork), it was delicious in terms of flavor.   Enjoyable and well worth the visit, particularly for a filling and simple brunch after a lot of perhaps other excessive Vegas meals. Solid option for folks looking for an easy place to dine along the Strip.",

    "text": "This restaurant is in front of the Paris Casino and has a great ambiance.  It is very updated and is very open.  They have outdoor and indoor seating, but the way they have the restaurant set up it has the feel of covered outdoor seating.  The wait staff were cordial but very busy and therefore we had to wait a long time for everything (like coffee refills :-\\ ).  We had the corned beef hash (a very small portion), the Farm Fresh Eggs with a side of bacon, and coffee.  Although the portion was small the corned beef was good, and so were the farm fresh eggs and bacon.  I think the coffee was the best part of the meal, but like I said we had to wait for it.    If you do not want to wait, they do take reservations, which we recommend.  Overall, although this wasn't our best experience we would still recommend it for those that are already close by.",

They pointed us to the bar area.  We could sit anywhere and hang out.  They had nifty little private alcoves.  The restaurant is beautiful.    The menus are not grammatically correct.  Normally neither am I!  I went up to the bar to get a drink.  I asked for the Desert Smash without rosemary agave and asked if I could get it with regular agave.  Pretty sure I asked nicely, but the bartender bit my head off and told me it wasn't rosemary agave.  It was rosemary AND agave in the drink.  Oh okay - the menu was missing a comma.  Maybe they were really understaffed.  Maybe she was having a bad day.  Maybe she has to answer queries about rosemary agave all day everyday... She never warmed up to me.  Maybe my Vegas hair was too big for her liking.  We did eventually get a table after a long wait.  Outside.  The interior remained empty.  It is very nice on the patio and we were fine to be outside.  The food was very tasty, though it too took a long time to arrive.  The oddest thing, other than the grumpy bartender, was we were close to a POS station with glassware.  A few waiter/waitress were taking care of business and a glass fell and shattered by an occupied table.  The wait staff just finished up their business before checking on the affected patrons.  That seemed weird.  They could have been cut or gotten glass on them.  Seemed very uncaring not to check on them immediately.  Great location, people watching, food/bev, but oddly uncaring service.",

    "text": "Worst experience I've ever had by any establishment in my life. This is clearly no mastros when it comes to service. I visited this place for my birthday weekend and had a pretty ok time I think our party of 8 saw a server about 4 times. Fast forward to receiving the check it took our server 20 to get to us just so we could tell him and another 20 min to come back. When our server finally gets to us he then tells my husband his card declined which was odd ( clearly there was money on the card). After giving the server cash he comes back with the same amount of cash and a receipt for ya to sign from the card that was \"declined\". After signing we start to leave and decide to call the bank  for transactions to see why it was declined. After 5 min we get through and see the payment went through the first time the server swiped and 4 times after that that he swiped. To our surprise we had payed for our food and drinks 5 times. Our bank assured us that the payments were not declined that they asked for customer authorization. Anyone who has WELLS FARGO knows it's as simple as texting Wells Fargo yes (which we did). After learning this we then requested to speak to a manager and again to our surprise he already knew why my husband and I were pretty pissed.   We were shocked that \"Christian\" the head manager had a attitude with us before we even explain to him what happened. He never apologized or took responsibility he simply acknowledged that he was the one present while the server swiped the card multiple times. At that point we realized not even the manager had common sense to say hey STOP SWIPING just go see if they authorized the payment. Before we could even get out what the procedure was he threw his hand in our face and attempted to call security. My husband and I are not in the business of embarrassing ourselves in public and starting a scene we have children and businesses so we were really taken back at the type of behavior this manager displayed. Another manager I believe Ari stepped in and can I say his attitude was the complete opposite he was apologetic and wasn't the least but dismissive of there mistake.  Btw can I add Christian attempted to call the police on us. I've never been in a racist situation but if this was it I defiantly felt it.   NEVER IN LIFE WILL I EVER STEP FOOT IN HERE AGAIN.",

We went for drinks the first day and tried one of the potion drinks. It was super sweet. Great for the insta, not worth the money though.   Two days later we needed food AND drinks. We sat down and waited for about 20 minutes. Our waiter kept walking past saying I'll be right back. Not gonna lie, we were thinking about leaving. THANK GOODNESS we didn't. Sean was triple sat right as we walked in, hence the long wait. Once he could get to us, he was the best! Him and his helper Josh never let our bottomless mimosas get even half empty. Very attentive and helpful with the menu. He was willing to take a picture of the group, followed by a selfie with him! One of the best waiters I've had in a while. Very personable.  The food was great too! The turkey club was amazing. 3 of the 4 of us had it. The 4th had the chicken and waffles with the bourbon syrup. As a KY girl, I enjoyed it! It was a perfect mixture of sweet and savory.",

The carrot cake pancakes, superb! Did not need syrup, all was needed was the whipped cream cheese frosting, it was not too sweet and not too bland, just perfect. The corned beef hash, they used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, that made all the difference, total game changer! Though it would of been better if it came with a side of toast or English muffin. Overall, the service was great, food was great. Definitely coming back here again next time! I prefer outdoor seating just because it is quite loud inside and a little stuffy. The servers really do go above and beyond their job duties.",

    "text": "Let's be honest, I found this place after the most recent Jersey Shore- Vegas episode. We were lucky enough to be able to going to the following weekend so we decided to give this place a try.   We sat on the patio which sits right on the strip across from the Bellagio, so you are able to watch the fountains while enjoying brunch.  We both tried the Hexx Benedict and it was amazing. A smart twist on a classic with the variation of thin sliced potatoes instead of an English muffin. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Love that this place is open late. This last trip to Vegas, I was actually surprised to learn how hard it is to find a good restaurant open past 10:30.   We had the surf and turf sliders and shrimp ceviche to start.  The sliders were on brioche so that's always great, but the lobster flavor was covered by the short rib so I wouldn't get these again.  The shrimp ceviche, however, was amazing.  Large portion.  A lot of spiciness though and there's nothing on the menu to tell you it might be spicy, much less that it will be very spicy.    We also got the cheesy garlic bread and the pasta carbonara.  The bread looked great, but was very meh.  The carbonara was amazing.  So, come here late night and def get the shrimp ceviche and carbonara.",

    "text": "What a great experience we had here. It all started with our server Mike. Super attentive and very welcoming. My husband showed up at the table first and let Mike know we were celebrating my dads 70th birthday and we had my aunt and uncle surprising him. Once we all were there he introduced himself and welcomed all of us for the celebration. We ordered a Purple Haze that he suggested. I wasn't a big fan of it. It kind of tasted like medicine to me but I'm also not much of a drinker. But everyone else at the table liked it. We got some calamari and the meat and cheese plate. Both very tasty. We later ordered our dinner. I was very pleased with my spaghetti carbonara. I tried my aunts filet mignon and that was very tender and flavorful. My husband had the braised short rib. Very good as well. All in all Mike took care of topping off our waters and assuring we had a great experience. Brought out a little birthday treat for my dad. Thanks again Mike for outstanding service. We will see you on our next trip out!",

The service was quick and very professional and polite. I had a traditional breakfast with eggs, bacon, homemade English muffin (made in house) and potatoes. Even though that's a basic breakfast, it was done better than most breakfast places I've been to. It was exactly what I wanted. My friend got the corned beef hash and loved it. It's Vegas, so be prepared to spend a little more than what you'd expect for what you're getting. However, I didn't mind at all based on the good food and good service!  Also, if you're in the mood, they have bottomless mimosas for $24. That's a pretty good deal for Vegas, where most mixed drinks will set you back $15 or more!",

I was disappointed that there were no pickled vegetables as was advertised. The flavored vodka wasn't my favorite and I must say I prefer a more basic vodka that is doctored up with spices and sauce. Service wasn't bad at all and it was nice to sit outside and people watch. The food on the menu looked alright but nothing stood out enough to try as we had dinner plans. Definitely somewhere to try once for their extravagant items but be prepared for the price.",

He checked in on us frequently and made us feel welcome. The food was good, portions are huge and very reasonably priced.  I ordered the veggie omlet and it is definitely large enough to feed two. The ambience is casual and calm. The restaurant was crowded but our food and drinks came out quickly. If you're looking for a tasty and reasonably priced  brunch, I highly recommend Hexx!

Our server did a great job at making sure we never had an empty glass, as well as plenty of water. He verified with the kitchen what items we could order that were vegan (breakfast potatoes with no cheese and a bowl of fresh fruit - we added a side of avocado as well to round out the meal). My step son ordered the Benedict and he loved it! Our server didn't complain when I showed him our Groupon - (they have a great deal right now for hexx) and we left here happy, and full. This place makes amazing breakfast potatoes, I used to love them with two over medium eggs before we went vegan, and I'm happy I can still enjoy them sans the huevos.",

    "text": "There were two people who knew what they were doing at this trendy resto in Vegas on our recent visit. The lady behind the reservation computer and the bartender. Everything else was chaos. More than half of the tables were empty yet they claimed a 45 min wait for brunch on a Saturday. We said find and ordered a cocktail to enjoy during our wait. We were actually seated very quickly but in a table in the connecting space between the two outside seating areas that was very windy and cold. We took the table and placed our order but after freezing for a few minutes asked to be moved to one of the empty tables either further in or out but not in the wind tunnel in between. Again we were told nothing was available,. Seriously at this time there was no line and more than half the tables were empty. We let them know to cancel our order and walked out. Clueless would be a complement here. Aside from the nice view of the fountains at Bellagio across the street I can think of no reason to go here. We walked to Mon Ami Gabi 100 yards across the entrance to Paris Paris and had such a lovely meal and great service that we returned 3 more times there during this trip. Don't waste your time or money here at Hexx.",

The mimosas were delish. We pretty much enjoyed all our food. What I wasn't expecting was how surprisingly their fruit salad was...it real good! I was expecting a typical fruit medley but this salad was big and each bite of fruit was sweet and perfectly ripe!  Our server was great too. She was friendly and attentive. I'd come back here.",

We ordered the maple glazed bacon for an appetizer. It was really good. It was thick cuts of bacon more on the line of small cuts of pork belly. Hubby ordered the Hex burger with white chocolate bun with fries. I ordered the club sandwich with herb aioli and cranberry bread. It was so delicious. Our friends ordered a meat omelette and Hex burger also. Everyone was pleased with their food. When we are in Vegas we will be back",

Then they brought us a free pitcher of a different flavored steaming cocktail because it was my birthday!!! Loved that!! The manager also came to our table twice to ensure that our meal was good and wished me a happy birthday which I thought was very nice.   All of the food we had was delicious but j must say the dessert and the cocktails were the best part. We got the mocha espresso flourless chocolate cake and a chocolate ice cream sundae and both were phenomenal!   From the outdoor seating area you can see the bellagio fountain show across the street which is a must see when in Vegas! I thought the prices were very reasonable for the location.

Just too perfectly round. A little weird. Also, they charge a cnf. Concession fee for being on the strip. Something like 5% added to your bill. Manager said the owners charge it because of how expensive it is to run a business on the strip. Also, it's a decent view of the Bellagio fountains, however it is very, very loud because it is an open environment. I would not go back. Many better options here in Vegas.

Our initial experience was good, however once the food came, I found a paper napkin or something in one of my pancakes which put a damper on the meal. We thought about mentioning it to the staff but they took so long to come by with the check that we just wanted to leave by then. The food tasted good otherwise and staff was friendly.",

Then sat indoors waited over 10 min without being offered water or a menu. Finally complained to manager and got service. Ordered the club salad. It came overloaded with soft giant bland cubes of bread that were supposed to be croutons and missing the turkey.  Awful food and bad service. Wish we would have walked out at the start and went to the much better Moni Mi Gabi",

The molten cake was serve deconstructed and the cake had no form - it made for an unusual dish and I'm not sure I like it that way but it tasted good and rich.

If want a better meal go to near by Birristas Italian restaurant for WAY better food for a decent price ( they give you wine with your meal).",

We were approached that we did not check in, so a manager came and asked if we could check in and sit down.  There wasn't anyone waiting so I'm not sure why they actually asked us to go check in to go sit down where we were so we left. Assumably this is the reason why it's half empty where everywhere else in the vicinity with a patio is full.   So... we're staying at Paris as try to give this place another chance, benefit of the doubt. It's 4:30 so it's not really dinner but we hoped to grab a drink and some appies on the patio. Nope, not this place. They can't chase us away fast enough. They explained if we weren't both going to order an entree we had to sit inside at the desolate bar with not a soul in sight. Again, more than half the patio empty. We opted to go next door and had a great time. I guess we'll just never try this place since they can't chase away their customers fast enough. Twice you come.. twice they can't be bothered ",

She said no and made a show of picking up the dirty napkin and tossing it behind the couch seating but still in view.  She then tells my wife \"well if that makes a difference here you go.\"  We were about to walk out but decided to first let the manager know what happened.  The manager apologized profusely and promised to take care of us.  Our waiter Jackson turned out to be fantastic in terms of service, conversation and attitude.  The manager also comped a good portion of the meal which was excellent.  Aside from the hostess that seemed to want to be anywhere but there, it was a nice experience.",

    "text": "After visiting for happy hour, dessert, and brunch, I can confidently say that the food at Hexx is better than it needs to be for a Strip location with patio seating and an attached dessert/gift shop. Apparently the chef from Due Forni (a local gem) recently took over the kitchen and is responsible for many of the improvements.  For HH (20% off apps plus drink discounts), the Surf & Turf sliders and Flatbread Carpaccio were both solid flavor-wise but neither was quite what we expected. Menu makes no mention of the barbecue component of the short rib-lobster pairing but it somehow worked. Shout out to the amazing housemade kettle chips on the side. The flatbread flavors needed the mustard sauce to harmonize and seemed to be closer to a tartare than a carpaccio, but it got devoured, too.   Brunch featured a swath of dishes from all over the menu, with the Prime Rib French Dip falling flat while others like the Hexx Benedict (featuring a base made of scalloped potatoes!), Chicken & Waffles (elevated by housemade pickles and bourbon-maple syrup),  and Carrot Cake Pancakes (a well-balanced sweet and savory combo) stood out as reasons to come back. The Twisted Sticky Bun was a little too sweet and a little too doughy for my personal preference but makes a great share dish, particularly if you don't opt for other sweets.   Dessert is really where they shine, though! The S'Mores Semifreddo is a creative presentation  that combines all the classic flavors with an emphasis on the toasted marshmallow. The safe-sounding Peanut Butter Cheesecake also gets you a photogenic treat with spun sugar and candied peanuts, and tasted both super creamy and nicely nutty.   Service varied on my visits, from our super-friendly brunch host to an absent-when-needed bartender. Reservation and seating policies seem inconsistent, with one hostess militantly insisting she couldn't seat my party til all were present while another graciously rushed us to our table five minutes after appointment time regardless that one guy was still stuck in the parking garage. Luckily the great food made up for the lackluster introduction for others in our group who had no previous experience here... but it should still be addressed.",

    "text": "Restaurant is better for brunch, which takes place 7 days a week, vs dinner. Dinner menu is over priced (pizzas are $20+), limited in variety and lacks cohesion. From what we sampled it was good but once again over priced. The short rib entree ($38) was the size of a Tomahawk steak with bone just as large. Although enough for two people they could serve a smaller portion and lower the price. Mac and cheese ($13) was bland and tasted like Kraft white cheddar straight from the box. Even the server agreed. White bean hummus ($10) was great but they give you so little pita bread youre stuck with half the jar remaining and no pita bread.    One sticking point that will not see me returning or sending any of my friends is the fact you cant use the 20% off business card they give out and Opentable giftcard at the same time. One is to be treated like cash and the other is a discount offered by the restaurant. We could have split the check and created a hassle but its not worth it. Manager came by and snidely said 'you can use this 20% off next time.' They want your business but not bad enough to honor their own discounts.",

I had the wedge salad, great choice- so fresh and yummy. Definitely satisfied.   A few days later my sister and I stopped in for breakfast. Again a great experience.

Instead of an English muffin from most places, Hexx serves poached eggs on scalloped potatoes! It was very tasty, we enjoyed every last bite. With that being said, I do wish the serving size for the eggs Benedict was a little bigger since it is more on the pricey side (but worth it)!",

    "text": "I tasted lots of great foods at our table, so I have little doubt that my dining companions will swarm this listing with 4- or even 5-star reviews. Unfortunately, my own entree was lacking.  HEXX Kitchen + Bar is a newer American restaurant that took over the Sugar Factory space. This is a great location, with entrances to the Strip and the floor of Paris Las Vegas.  I accepted an invitation to Saturday brunch, which took place in a busy and loud dining room (which drowned out the 80s-heavy music mix) with lighter colors all over that wouldn't seem out of place in a tropical getaway. Maybe that's some sort of implied appeal toward women (you know, the \"XX\"), but our table as well as the rest of the main dining room seemed to have an even mix of genders.  Without further ado, allow me to dissect the problem child, the Prime Rib French Dip ($19). The portion was ample, so no problem there. As expected, I experienced rich flavor between the beef and the au jus. The hoagie roll was capable of soaking up that au jus without being too thick or distracting, so another win.  The first notable concern is that I had at least two gristly bites which most would spit out and call inedible. This suggests that cheap meat may have been used or at least that the meat wasn't trimmed/cleaned completely. I also found the thin-cut fries to be pedestrian and not very fluffy or crispy. They were only barely useful as a vehicle for the \"horseradish cream\" that wasn't very strong, perhaps diluted with ranch or something similar.   And seriously, what's up with how runny that sauce is? I already have the loose liquid dip that is supposed to saturate every crevice upon dipping, so this second sauce simply slipped off. Execution and design flaws all around detract from what could've been a great entree.  I have to give most of the weight of the rating to the food that mostly filled my belly, so even the standouts of what I sampled from around the table weren't enough for me to feel comfortable with giving 4 stars.  Magick Dragon cocktail: pay attention when the server pours the liquid into the pitcher. It instantly activates the bed of dry ice, and a clear smoky vapor starts pouring out. This really is a great show. However, the cocktail itself doesn't have any sort of tart or gingery notes aside from the sweet, vaguely tropical fruit profile. For that alone, I'd recommend against ordering this drink even if you're trying to find something to share between multiple people.  Also, a minor quibble, but I'm pretty sure that the dry ice froze the last fraction of the drink. We had neither time or temperature to deal with that, but it was annoying that we still saw color despite not being able to consume any of it.  Twisted Sticky Bun ($8): Rick M's order. Huge, chewy yet soft, and non-saccharine version of this breakfast pastry. I loved the cream cheese topping and the crispy pecans. This is best for sharing unless you have a huge sweet tooth.  Chicken and Waffles ($24): Clint B's entree. Both items were crispy and the chicken was delicious and fork-tender. I didn't really get much of the apple-cheddar character of the waffle in my limited sampling, but it sounds delightful. Price concerns aside, I'd definitely consider ordering it for myself, and it's likely one of the best takes locally on this classic (and considering that Clint prefers another Strip restaurant's rendition, I'm also putting that one on my list).  We were all too full to contemplate ordering dessert, but our server did present to us one small piece each of two different, house-made chocolate blends. I can't recall the names, but one had some fruity flavors in it, and both seemed to provide complex bitter notes despite initially tasting like milk chocolates. They mentioned that we could get 15% off chocolates at their store (a separate business listing), and I may have to consider making that visit next time I'm in the area.  Ultimately, I would consider returning to HEXX Kitchen + Bar, although I'm not in any hurry. I'll just have to remember to skip the French Dip and avoid anything else with fries like the plague.",

It was mostly due to lack of service, our waitress did not seem to be too attentive to our table. In fact, multiple times I had to track her down to either order something, get a refill and ask for additional condiments. I'm addition, after we ordered a dessert, the waitress came out 10 min later to tell us the dessert was not available. This happened twice... It would be better if the waitress was able to inform us earlier that certain desserts were not available at that time instead of waiting after we ordered. We were definitely at the restaurant for much longer than what we intended. I mean, I didn't want to spend most of time in Vegas at a restaurant...  Regarding the food, I was not too fond of the corn beef hash. I was expecting it to be more fried but it had a very soft texture. However, I also tried the carrot pancakes and I actually really like the flavor of the pancake. It is topped with a nice cream cheese frosting which is delicious as I did not need additional syrup. The frosting was sweet enough with the pancakes and I would definitely recommend that if you are in the mood for a sweeter side. The dessert we got was the smores which had ice cream in between Graham crackers topped with heated marshmallows and chocolate. Definitely try if you like the mix of warm and cold desserts!",

Even sitting inside you are almost right on the strip as when we went it had open walls to the outside.

So as far as breakfast, I had the chilaqueles the first day and they were out of this world. Second time I ordered the banana nut French toast and it was just wrong.

We didn't feel rushed to eat, even though the place began to get busy half way through dinner. Our waiter was good! We used a pre-purchased Groupon, so it took a while for the manager to come over and verify our purchase, luckily we had time to spare. Some of the dishes are a little pricey! The food left much to be desired. I ordered the Pappardelle and the sauce was very bland. I added shrimp, but the sauce actually made the shrimp taste bad. My boyfriend had the Tagliatelle Scampi, which was okay. We had planned this in advance, so we were really looking forward to dinner here. Unfortunately, we were let down. However, we tried the carrot cake dessert.... Now that was delicious! I highly recommend it.",

Another party arrives next to us , keep in mind we were there first and the waiter was there easy asking for drinks right away. The manager clearly seen us sitting there with no help. As I got up and asked if he was the manager he said \"yes\" I told how long we were waiting there for he asked if we wanted to sit back down, but I told him no thank you and left. I take it because we are Hispanic we weren't top priority! Sad that we have to be blonde with blue eyes to get served right away! Never again! Wish I could give no stars!",

The food was fantastic, and very affordable for the quality, and the waitstaff was pleasant, attentive, and accommodating. This was my favorite place we dined all weekend!  My friend and I split two pizzas (about 10\" in diameter): the Pepperoni and the White. Both were really tasty, and the pepperoni even had an extra kick because they use arrabiata sauce instead of just tomato/marinara. We also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese which was to die for. It was so rich and creamy that we could barely finish it after starting on the pizzas. It's a small dish, but well worth the price.   To top it all off, we got these fun mixed drinks (unfortunately I can't remember their names, and they're not on the online menus) that are served with dry ice to create a bubbling cauldron, of sorts. They're big servings (and run about $38 apiece), and if it hadn't been for a 21st birthday, we surely would have split one drink between two people. As it was, we each drank one and survived, and I didn't find it too strong, especially when consumed slowly with dinner.   The ambiance and decor was dark and rich, and we could see chocolate being made to one side of the dining room. Bonus points for the attached candy store!",

I wanted to originally try burgr, which was located near by but only because the wait was over an hour, I decided to walk next door and try something with less of a wait so my son did not have to wait any longer for dinner.  Well I read reviews on Yelp, and I originally only saw two stars. I was worried but I gave it a shot. Unfortunately, to my dismay , the Yelp reviews were rather accurate. I ordered the margarita pizza, and it was just horrible! I had to return it to get a plain Cesar salad, only because I was scared to try anything else.   My boyfriend ordered the short rib dish. You would think that this would be amazing. We have tried this dish on various occasions at different restaurants, being that it's on of my boyfriends favorites! Unfortunately this location did not nail the dish.  it was possibly the horse radish that was included in the Brussels sprouts that turned him away from giving this dish any good review.   My son probably ordered the most normal and decent dish. The hamburger. Plain and simple and you cannot mess it up right ? Yet , my 6 year old didn't really pick on the fries . What 6year old doesn't like French fries? Well mine does on a regular basis , although this place had the coldest and grossest French fries I ever had .   Last disappointment ? CNF fee added at the end of your receipt. Other yelpers have discussed this in their review. And it's True folks ! It exists and it's annoying !  never again will I come back here.",

My friend and I both got the surf and turf sliders which came with fries.  When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the portion size and the look of the sliders. The menu boasted that it had lobster and short rib meat in the sliders. All I got was two sliders with lots of short rib meat and small bit of lobster meat. It was good but a bit dry. The fries were good at least. Overall not wowing for me at all :/. The sliders were pretty expensive too which I thought it wasn't worth it. Perhaps if I ordered something else it would have been better food experience.",

    "text": "Did not have a great experience our first time at HEXX this last weekend.  We were celebrating a friend's birthday and went there for brunch with bottomless mimosas etc.  We were seated in huge square room that was very densely packed with tables, and the noise in there was deafening.  A room like that would have been crazy loud as is with so many tables, but they pump in ultra loud club music over the top.  I might sound like a grumpy old timer complaining about the noise, but I measured it with the NIOSH app on my phone and got sustained readings above 90 decibels!  That is loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage in as little as an hour.  I feel bad for the poor employees, although some of them will likely have winning lawsuits against HEXX for not providing the required hearing protection for employees in an industrial noise level environment.  Aside from the noise, the food was solid but the service was not great.  It took forever (20+ minutes sitting on empty) to get refills on coffee / mimosas, which should be easy for them to top off regularly.    Also be advised that they tack on a 4.875% \"concession\" fee to every bill.  I (and everyone else on the planet) hates this practice that is becoming more common all the time in Vegas.  Just put the real price on the menu instead of being deceptive about it.  I won't be back to HEXX unless I hear they have made some real improvements to the experience.",

I walked in at 11:45 AM and Hexx was packed af with tourists and locals as well.  The hostess table had our reservation and we were seated immediately.  Our server was fantastic as she always kept our waters and mimosas fresh during our day drinking at Hexx.  Other servers had no issues with filling up the mimosas as well.  Considering how packed Hexx was, I was really impressed with how fast our dishes made it to the table.  Contemporary decor, an attractive full service bar and outdoor seating make for a very nice dining area.  There's plenty of tables and booths to seats hundred(s?) of diners.  Hexx brunch cuisine:  We started with the cheesey bread as a shared appetizer and it was delish.  Cheesey greatness with warmed carbs was a hit with us.  My meat omelette came out a little dry and there was minimal cheese but packed with bacon, chicken, sausage and pork as promised on the menu.  If I were to guess, the omelette was waiting too long on the counter to be served.  The rest of the crew mentioned their dishes were ok:  Croissant sandwich and the po boy sandwich.  We are so spoiled with Vegas being a foodie city, it creates tremendous pressure for Strip restos.  Well, the service was amazing and  but the brunch dishes were just mediocre at premium strip prices.  The wonderful staff and service will bring me back and hopefully I'll run into better luck with the cuisine.  Cheers!",

She asked us if we were just getting here and gave us a whole list of recommendations to go to.  We came here about 10:30 and the restaurant was about 25% at capacity and when we left it was at 60%.   The restaurant is open air so it was a little cold inside but otherwise the atmosphere is nice. They have a variety of items for brunch and I got one of their most popular the chicken and waffles.   The chicken was crispy and the waffle was fluffy like cake. It was a good contrast of savory and sweet. It was a big portion as well so if your really hungry this would fill you up.   It can get busier during the day, but they offer reservations on open table. I would recommend get one to avoid long wait times.",

I absolutely love the view from the patio, which is centered right outside of the bellagio fountains! The prices were a little up there for what I felt I was getting. I hate to say that my filet mignon as completely over seasoned! All I could taste was the pepper.. but my friends had all amazing things to say about the wedge salad! I'm going to put it up to a fluke, as my friend flat iron stake was great! This is one of those stake houses where all of the sides are a la carte so keep that in mind when dining in!  They had an ABSOLUTELY amazing meat and cheese plate! It was to die for and by far my favorite thing about the whole experience!",

    "text": "During, the SUMMER this place is BUSY! I always, avoid crazy busy places in Vegas. I love the WINTER here! It was a perfect time to stop by and use my GROUPON! I was extremely excited for it!   I was soooo, excited I totally, forgot to take a picture of the menu. I was caught up with YELP and reviewing comments and pictures about the food. Who else does this?   I was using good ok' YELP to order my food!Thanks, to ya'll for taking pictures. I ordered the Breakfast Croissant with the MOST AMAZING potatoes! Every bit I took, I was like: Mmmmmmm!!!  You walk in and it has a \"hotel vibe\" decor feeling. Then you look around and the art on the walls are eccentric and cool looking  As I reviewed more YELP REVIEWS...Why didn't I ever see anything on the customer service? I was not impressed. When you walk in there's three blond hair ladies who didn't have a warm greeting. I was trying to conversation saying how cool the decor was and she kept to herself.  We sat down and were approached by a man who served us water and had great customer service. It's too bad I didn't get his name because, he was pretty epic and welcoming! I hope he runs the place soon! The world needs more people like that guy!   My poor review is based on how the customer service was from when we walked in - and how our service was when we ordered our food! This place is, \"EXTRA\" the service should be too! You pay $100 and up to fine-dine here! I would expect the service to be grand... you pay for what you get, right? Especially, since the restaurant is on the strip!  We clearly, stated it was our first time here!A few suggestions other than, \"chilaquiles and croissant are good\"... would be nice! I placed my order and so, did my other 4 guest. We also, ordered a dry ice drink that comes in the pitcher. Later, I noticed a large party and they ordered the coolest drink, \"A DISCO BALL\"!!!  My eyes lit up!!! I was like, \"Wait, a freakin' minute... why was this not suggested to us???\" I was bummed!!! We come from California to dine in pretty cool spots in Vegas! The service was mediocre! I was not impressed with the customer service at all! Next, time I'll be joining a buffet or dine at a Mexican restaurant where the service is awesome!  Especially, because this spot is on the strip-the customer service should be a great experience! Also, we were not able to take our plastic pitcher home. Our drink was $35!  A place like this should've allowed me even to pay extra for it! The worse part was, not allowing us to use our Groupon for separate bills. It was clear we weren't paying together and we were separate parties. This was horrible!   Be careful when you come here! If you don't care about service or Groupon-then go for it!",

If I would  have any critique for Hexx, the pancake was a little tough (carrot cake), the egg (chiliquiles) was overcooked, and the waffle (chicken and waffle) was soft.  If I'm paying $25 for chicken and waffle, I'm expecting the waffle to be a little crunchy - not soft/soggy.  Service was mediocre.  Noticed that the server disappears every once in a while even though there were only 5-6 parties dining with them.  Bottom line, food is good, cost -  fair to expensive, ambiance/view is good, service is fair.",

    "text": "We ventured to Hexx on a Friday with 12:30 p.m. reservations. We were so glad we had them as they were really busy. Despite arriving early, we were quickly sat in the main dining room. We were offered the option to eat outside but it was warm and windy. They have the giant windows / doors so it's still open air seating, but it felt cooler inside. This restaurant faces the Bellagio Fountains so the view is amazing.   We got two appetizers - calamari and garlic bread. Both were wonderful. The garlic bread is unique that it's a pull apart bread. We wanted more immediately.  My fiance got the Hexx Benedict and the Cinnaroll waffle. I went with the Chicken and Waffles. The other couple with us got the protein breakfast option.   They also do bottomless mimosas for $20 a person. It felt pricey with four of us but they were poured well and we definitely got our money's worth. We also shared one of their really cool potion drinks that have dry ice to give a smoking effect. I could of skipped the drink. It's cool, but it's a whopping $38 per drink.   The foods was hands down amazing. We enjoyed each bite and the table unanimously agreed the Hexx Benedict was the best dish. It's served over potatoes for a unique twist, and the layers of flavor shines through. I kept taking bites as my fiance ate his waffle. Ha! I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles. Perfectly cooked chicken that wasn't heavily breaded and a light, fluffy waffle. The protein combo looked good and was a nice balance to the heavy appetizers. The couple we were with really enjoyed it.   We skipped desert as we were full. Out tab was around $289, but we had five entrees (the cinnamon waffle counts as one), two appetizers, a potion drink, and four bottomless mimosas so it balances out.",

He never checked on us. The bus boy was actually good, kept bringing us water and even asked us everything was ok, we thought he became our new waiter. We had to ask him for the bill and 20 minutes later our waiter brings the bill. We asked for the manager and he took an additional 20 minutes.

Bottomless Mimosas = because who doesn't love these!?!?! $24 for the bottomless option, and they come by to fill you up often, which was nice.  2. The Sticky Bun = do yourself a favor and order this. The bun itself is sweet and fluffy, and the cream cheese frosting is decadent and pairs perfectly on top. It's a heavy dish, so plan on sharing. 3. The Chilaquiles = GET THIS! I love me a good chilaquiles, especially after a night out. The chips were the right level of crispiness, and the dish has a nice amount of extras (guac/salsa/sour cream) without being too messy. Also they slice up the jalapenos nice and thin, but they still gave off some heat. I definitely recommend this dish!  The only real issue I had was with the wait. I'm not crazy, I know you're going to wait for a restaurant in Vegas on the weekend, but we were initially told 15 minutes and it took well over half an hour to get us seated... so I just wish they would be more conservative with their estimates, since nobody loves to wait.

It was my fathers 60th birthday, and our server Jasmine didn't disappoint! Great food suggestions, and she ended our dinner by surprising Dad with an adorable birthday dessert, candle and all. I'll be back very soon, and will be requesting Jasmine as my waitress!! THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY DAD'S BIRTHDAY ONE TO REMEMBER!",

Guess what? Two minutes later they were super comfy and perfect.   The food: get the CHEESY GARLIC BREAD! There's a hint of lemon, which you might not expect, but it makes the whole thing just sing.   You can never go wrong with a chopped salad and this was no exception. Anything with hearts of palm has me at hello.   Since there were 4 of us, we all got different entrees and each one was yummier that the others. Oh! And get the CHICKEN! We don't order chicken at restaurants -until now! I will go back for this. (And while the mashed potatoes are perfect, do yourself a favor and sub them out for the RISOTTO!) the SHORT RIB fell apart as it should, the SALMON was buttery and sumptuous and the CRAB CAKE ?!? HUGE!   Dessert and coffee were no slouches either. But none of it held a candle to our server, Jasmin. She took a great experience and made it extraordinary! Her recommendations were on point and her friendliness made us want her to sit down to join us. ASK FOR JASMIN!   We didn't take food pics because we were so busy eating! But the iconic pic on the wall had all of us obsessed! Go check this place out!!!",

Small portions  Food:  Corned beef hash $18: I would not order this again. Too much hollandaise sauce and a pip squeak amount of beef. This dish was TINY... probably the size of my palm.  Carrot Cake Pancakes $13: This was pretty good as I am a HUGE carrot cake fan. The pancakes were not as fluffy as I had hoped and came out to be a little dry.   Drinks: bottomless mimosas until 3pm?  Service: SLOWWW. I had to flag down my waitress every time I needed her. Food took greater than 30 minutes from ordering to come out.  Honestly, I'm looking elsewhere for brunch... but don't forget to check in for free dessert!",

For some reason the chef stated that this wasnt an option with an omelette. But hey, I rather enjoyed my meal.   Oh and mimosas are delicious as well. I will definitely be returning to try other options.",

We asked the waiter for recommendations on main dishes and she suggested the Breakfast Pizza. Something new for me so I tried it. My friend got the Breakfast Croissant. Both were very delicious!! I hope to visit when I return to Vegas! Menu selections are not massive which makes it easier in my opinion to pick something you want to eat.",

    "text": "There are so many good things and bad things going for Hexx. Let's start with the good. You have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and strip with the outdoor seating. Check-in with yelp and get yourself a free dessert. They limit this 1 per table do that is the bad thing. My friend and I are both yelpers but they wouldn't accommodate both of us checking in on yelp. They have brunch 7 days a week. Nuff said. Bottomless mimosas (til 2 pm) and a colossal Bloody Mary served in a pitcher.   The service started out pretty good. Besides the fact that  the hostess at the hostess stand stood there instead of helping the other hostess seat people. We waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated even though there were tables clearly open. I'm guessing it's because that don't have enough servers. I ended up ordering the Hexx Benny. Absolutely no regrets on this. My friend ordered the same and also ordered a Bloody Mary. The food came out before the Bloody Mary did. I brought it up to our server because I'm guessing he forgot. The base of the Benny was made with scalloped potatoes. Layered with Canadian bacon, poached eggs, asparagus and hollandaise. Those potatoes stole the show in my opinion. Such a great switch up on your typical eggs benny. As we finish up our meals, I brought up the yelp check in offer and our waiter had to go ask if we could both use it. He comes back and said that they only allow the 1 per table. So I let my friend use hers because I was going to take it to go anyway. When our server came back I said can we have separate checks. He agreed he would bring it out. He brought the dessert, but no checks in site so I brought it up again. He brings out the check and it was 1 check instead of 2. For whatever reason, restaurants in Vegas love bringing 1 check out. So I asked him again and it wasn't until the 3rd time we got separate checks. Highly recommend the Hexx Benny, but the service here needs some work.",

Breakfast: Chilaquiles Definitely more of a brunch dish as opposed to a breakfast. The salsa and chips combo had a kick, and the toppings balanced the dish. Only downside, gotta eat it quickly so the chips don't soggy!   Appetizer: Tomato Burrata and Crispy Broccolini The burrata was very similar to a bruschetta, with a honey reduction. The honey complimented the cheese. The broccolini sounds very odd, and I'm not sure what they do to it, but it's definitely worth a try! It's a very unique flavor and a great new spin on broccoli.    Dinner: Pappardelle Pasta The pasta was incredibly fresh, and the mushrooms weren't overpowering. Dish was big enough that 2 people could share.",

Definitely will be going back whenever we're in Vegas & I highly recommend you give it a try.

    "text": "Went here for brunch on Saturday and were told it would be a wait of 20 to 30 minutes. We decided to try bar section to avoid waiting and found two spots at the bar end. We were greeted with friendly and fast service that lasted throughout our dining experience. No service complaints whatsoever.   Onto the menu, they had a wide variety of options available. Something for even the pickiest of eaters. While scanning the options, we came across a unique eggs benedict offering. Instead of the usual bread or biscuit offering as a base, HEXX Benedict used scalloped potatoes. I never considered this as a possibility, but don't think I can go back to normal benedict now. It was the best version of eggs benedict I have ever had. Egg cooked perfectly, potatoes were just crispy enough, and the sauce had so much flavor. Must have for fans of eggs benedict We couldn't pass up the offering of bottomless mimosas for $23. Signage out front claims this offering is available daily until 2 pm. As we got close to empty an employee will fill back up. Make sure to ask for an extra in a to-go cup for your trip around the casino or down the strip. The prices are what you'd expect from the location. Hexx has a chocolate store located next door for a variety of sweets available after a meal. Overall I would recommend this place for those visiting the strip. Can't go wrong with great food and bottemless mimosas for brunch.",

Me and my husband went there to have brunch , I ordered a VEGETARIAN OMELETTE, my husband ordered margarita pizza, we waited 40 minuets for our orders and drinks and then when when the drinks and food finally came , I got a VEGETARIAN OMELETTE with BACON inside my omelette!!... I'm vegetarian for 16 years !!!!! If I'm ordering a vegetarian omelette like it's written in the menu, I expect it to be vegetarian!! When I called the manager and show her the bacon inside the omelette, she said she's sorry about the misunderstanding , it's not an answer to me. So me and my husband just left the restaurant upset and disappointed!!! We never come back to this place or recommend to our friends!!!",

However, upon asking the hostess and server multiple times if there are vegan options on the menu, they kept reassuring me that there were. Finally after waiting 30 minutes for a table, I sit down to find that the only vegan option for breakfast they offer is a MIXED BERRY FRUIT BOWL for $10 USD. Ridiculous. Had to run across the street to a Starbucks to grab a bagel afterwards.   Other than that, I give 3 stars because my family had nothing but good things to say about their dishes.",

    "text": "Took a trip down to Las Vegas about 2 weeks ago and came across this place as we were looking for a breakfast/brunch spot.   The atmosphere of this restaurant was extremely cleanly and nice. We were seated as soon as we walked in because the restaurant space is pretty large.   The menu was very straight forward and there was quite a few delicious looking items.   There were 4 of us and we tried the following items:  1. Corned Beef Hash  - Portion was pretty small, however the dish itself was very flavorful.   2. Gravlax Benedict  - Wasn't the biggest fan of the English muffin because when it was brought out it was pretty soggy so it didn't have the right taste to it, however when removing the muffin, the rest of the ingredients were very fresh and tasty.   3 . Chilaquiles - Expected to get some crispy nachos, however there was a slight problem to food coming out soggy. So it seemed as if the nachos stood out for awhile and by the time they got to the table, they were no longer crispy.   4. Candied Bacon  - This was probably my favorite thing that I tried. Although the candied bacon wasn't extra crispy, the flavor was superb. Each bite was mouthwatering.   5. Venezuelan Milk Chocolate Cheesecake  - Definitely a very delicious cheesecake and the portion was HUGE! The caramel popcorn on the sides was the perfect touch!   Overall a decent place to dine and another plus side to it is that it's open 24/7!!",

Sat on the inside but with the doors wide open so we had a good view of the bellagio water fountain show.   Customer service: amazing!! From the host to our server they were just perfect! I'm very indecisive so I ask a lot of questions and my server was so kind and patient with me. Love it!   Food: everything was so delicious!  Rib eye: melts in your mouth. Reasonably priced. Loved the caramelized onions and little peppers that come with it. Perfectly seasoned!  Caesar salad: I don't know what they put in the dressing but it's unlike any Caesar salad ive ever had. I'm gonna come back just for this salad!! Thin crispy bacon and crunchy croutons. Awesome!  Prime burger: made with wagyu beef. Best burger I've ever had! So good!   Hands down my fav place on the strip.   I'll be back!!",

Tasty food and excellent service ensued. I loved the salmon served in a bed of delicious black quinoa & wild mushrooms. My spouse was happy with the vegetable pizza. We spilt a Hexx chopped salad (good serving size); the sweet pepper gave a nice refreshing (yet not spicy) kick to the salad of hearts of palm, artichoke and tomato.  Our dining companions liked their Caesar salad of romaine and crisp ham, and split an order of juicy, tender (their words)16 oz rib eye steak with sides of creamy mashed potato and asparagus wrapped with ham topped with a fried egg! These complemented the steak well (steaks served sans accompaniments). Kevin, our server, was superb, providing good food/drink recommendations & explanations. He's friendly and was always one step ahead anticipating our needs. He made our dinner a very pleasant experience.",

I must say, I feel sorry for any employee of Hexx that has to be 'managed' by that woman.

It honestly went quick because we wandered close by until we received a text that our table was ready.

Last but not least, thanks for giving us dirty looks when we were finally leaving your sight. Maybe EVERYONE who works here was having a bad Monday? I heard a waiter being rude to a customer and the table next to us was trying to pay their bill for at least 10 mins, but they also had no waiter.",

I got the chicken and waffles and I almost licked the plate lol.  Plus the view is amazing. On top of everything it was my birthday and Taylor surprised me and my friend with a bowl of two chocolate lollipops and a birthday song.   5/5 recommend!!!!",

We went back a second time and not only were we NOT disappointed, we were even more impressed. We requested Taylor again and she was assisted by Patrick and Steven. Seriously, Taylor should classes on how servers should be. Go here. Ask for Taylor. Get the bottomless mimosas and enjoy!",

I had to remind the waiter of the drink I ordered after he brought us our food, and Our \"bread & butter\" service was just 2 slices of stale bread and olive oil. Even after we asked for butter (again), we never actually got the butter. This whole time we were served by 4 or 5 different people.

We'd just gotten out of a show nearby and restaurants start closing in droves after 10:30 pm even in Sin City.  HEXX is one of those places that run 24/7 and isn't your usual drab, out-dated cafe.    The staff are young, good-looking and smile even when you don't know what you're talking about.  My friend decided to order two shots, but since he's diabetic and rarely drinks he didn't know much about them.  The bartender was left to guess and what we got wasn't what he expected and wasn't drinkable.  They didn't charge for them, but I still felt bad.  The Hypnotizing Strawberry was awesome if kind of weak in the booze department and it cost $15.  That's high for any bar!  The cool looking Hexx potions (I actually think they must be pitchers to share) that they decorate with dry ice effects were over $30 each!  We ordered a Margherita Pizza and Spaghetti with Meatballs.  I thought the pizza was okay but I've had better.  The pasta, on the other hand, was great!  Three juicy, flavorful meatballs and a big pile of al dente spaghetti soaked in a wonderful tomato sauce coated with Parmesan and dried garlic.  Was it worth over $22?  Jury is still out on that one, but chances are we wouldn't return here even for that dish unless we were close by and thin on choices like this last time.  Service, ambience and food are pretty on point but just so very very pricey!  I'd gladly pay more for steak or seafood, but for pasta and a vegetarian pizza?  There are plenty of other places demanding high prices for food for now so we'll keep looking for that perfect place...",

    "text": "This was our second visit to the place within the same week. Our first visit was amazingly delicious with an extraordinarily great service. So, my parents who came from some 10,000 miles far to visit wanted to go back to Hexx right after eating there. So, we went back.   With our first step we all realized something was different. We were there at 9:30 AM and our server, Olivia, took us to the bar area (instead of the breakfast/brunch area) where the music was too loud for that hour of the day. About 10 minutes after sitting they opened up two of the window doors looking outside that created a high courant d'air around the area that we were sitting. I kindly asked Olivia whether she could close one of them to cut the air flow a little. She said straight no and said we can change our table and move somewhere behind the room. My parents carried their breakfast food to the back of the room bythemselves. Mom never got her glass of water back throughout our short stay there for breakfast. During the short period we were there they used the door to go outside for only 3 times -so maybe it was not a very big inconvenience to shut it off afterall??  Overall, the food was delicious but the whole experience was brought down by the distasteful service. We have only couple of days together to spend as a family IN A YEAR and we chose to eat at Hexx for breakfast expecting to have a good experience that would be accompanied by a good family conversation. Instead we found ourselves rushed in eating our breakfast to get out of the place as soon as possible and had a bad start for the day. I hope someone from Hexx would read this review to prevent something similar happening to others.",

Omg the English muffins that came with the omelettes were delish - they were home made, not like any English muffin I've bought at the store or had anywhere else.  The side of potatoes that came with the omelettes were also so amazing - crunchy and had some spice going on.  We really had good service and enjoyed our time here.  Recommend making reservations as it's busy weekend mornings. :)",

I really like coffee, their coffee is really good here! I would come here for the coffee alone.   I ended getting the chilaquiles (shredded chicken, roasted salsa, avocado, tortilla chips and eggs etc). This was an amazing breakfast dish! Packs tons of flavor, some heat but not too hot. I was full after this dish and didn't get to try anything else.   Great service as well. I will definitely make a point of making a stop here next time in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We really enjoyed the Hexx kitchen on our recent trip to Vegas. I purchased a Groupon and that helped with the cost - as with most casino restaurants - it's not cheap. We went for brunch and I had made reservations. We arrived early and they were able to seat us immediately. Reservations were probably not necessary that early unless you wanted to sit on the patio.   We were a party of four and we all ordered different meals. Our young twenty-one year olds ordered a flatbread pizza and the other ordered waffles. My partner ordered the steak and eggs and I had the corned beef hash. All of our meals were excellent and were plenty to leave us feeling satisfied. We even took some of the pizza and steak and potatoes home. The steak was extremely tender and flavorful. The potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. My hash was delicious and my eggs were cooked sunnyside exactly as they should have been - not over or under cooked.   The girls and I ordered the bottomless Mimosas and they were truly bottomless. Our server was Johnny on the Spot with the refills which our two girls took as a challenge - which the server won lol.   If we are ever in Vegas again, I will definitely add Hexx to the list of places to revisit!",

I've always walked along the strip and found HEXX to be perfectly located... their patio seating (with fan or heater) is the picture perfect spot for your Vegas visits.    We had a reservation at 5:30 (wanted to arrive earlier to grab their patio seating).  Upon arrival, the smiling and friendly hostess greeted us right away.  We hoped for and got the perfect patio seating -- overlooking the strip and right across from the Bellagio fountain, where we enjoyed the fountain show every 30-mins while we dined.  Thumbs up!!!  HEXX has the best wait staff!  They don't miss a beat.  They are fast, friendly, knowledgeable and flexible.  We were offered water right away.  Then the waitress came over to greet and check on us -- and made some dinner recommendations.  We opted for the following: * Purple Haze -- one of their signature drinks.  Very good with the fog ... unique drink  * Prime Rib (my fav!) -- cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was flavorful and tasty.  Prime rib was fresh and a True 16oz! * Rib Eye -- also cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned.   * Brussel Sprouts -- sides.  So good!  For those of you who don't like your veges.. you will be hooked!  ;) * Pumpkin creme brulee -- recommendation by waitress and she is spot on.  Excellent creme brulee and not too sweet.  I often don't like dessert where they use sugar to mask all taste..  but this creme brulee is not like that.  You can really taste the pumpkin and it's really good.  Highly recommended.  We enjoyed an excellent dinner at HEXX and I'm kicking myself why I haven't come sooner.  We've got this as our new Vegas dinner spot and will be back for sure!",

The food came out quickly and was not only presented well, but absolutely delicious.   My burger was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I devoured the entire thing despite having just eaten mcdonalds breakfast 30 minutes prior. The servers did not leave a single water glass or mimosa empty.

He wasn't alone.  I used a decibel meter on my phone and never got a reading under 85; 97 was the high.   Loudness aside, our food was good.  The service was prompt and server smiling.  The beer selection is a thumbs up.  My wife's drink was tasty.   Too bad we couldn't quickly catch up to the mood and revelry of the others. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",

I decided to order the hash. And guess what, a Big Ass Red Hair on My Plate. Like in plain sight. You mean to tell me, nobody, i mean nobody noticed that red hair lounging on the porcelain white plate before it ended up in front of me!! Maybe they'd cook, waitress, and bus boy needs some serious eye check.   Then it took me 10 minutes to flag down the waitress who was chatting and laughing away with the rest of the staff, who apparently gets paid to stand around instead of ensuring that their guest is ok with the food that they just ordered. Why is the food brought to you by someone else?? Who is doing the quality control?  Needless to stay although the food was good, it left me with a gross disgusting feeling.   Please keep in mind that the venue is absolutely beautiful. I sat right in front of their awesome huge TV.  Also i was never comped for my hairy plate.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Hexx for my birthday brunch on a very busy Sunday afternoon. We hadn't researched this place at all but decided to go in anyways since it looked like a cool place. We were offered the option of immediate bar seating or to check in and wait for a table. Normally, we would've opted to go to another place since we don't like waiting or sitting at the bar, but since we were hungry and tired, we chose to be seated in the bar. The only negative of our whole experience here was that we waited for about 10 mins before we were brought menus by the bartender, who ended up being our waiter. The wait was understandable though as the bartender had 4 or 5 other tables in his areas plus a few people sitting at the actual bar.   The menu had quite a few different things to choose from including sweet and savory brunch items, pizza, and salads, so I knew this would be a difficult decision for my boyfriend and I. In the end, I decided to go for the Veggie Burger and my boyfriend chose the Corned Beef Hash. Once we placed our order, the food came out fairly quickly considering how busy it was. My veggie burger was delicious! It had a great chipotle mayo with just the right amount of spice. Only thing I disliked about the sandwich was the huge slices of avocado, but that's just a personal preference. I am sure that someone who enjoys avocado would consider the avocado the be just the right amount. My boyfriend loved the corned beef hash too.  As for their drink menu, their brunch feature is $23 bottomless mimosas, which I feel like is a very fair price for unlimited mimosas in Vegas! There were a variety of other signature cocktails, bloody Mary's, beers, and wines to choose from as well. I opted for a simple Malibu and pineapple juice, while my boyfriend tried an IPA beer (Prairie Artisan, Phantasmagoria), which he enjoyed throughly.    Overall, we had a great experience here and will definitely be back to enjoy more of their delicious food next time we're in Vegas! Next time we will be sure to book a table ahead of time!",

The portions were quite large and my family of five shared four entrees with food leftover. Everything was delectable, and the service was great!

It was a taste of pure heaven! What an impression this left on us Carl went out of his way to ensure our first visit to Vegas was memorable and I will forever be grateful.

    "text": "This is my FAVORITE brunch spot in Las Vegas hands down and that's saying a lot seeing as how I'm a bruncholic.  It's located inside the Paris, the interior is so cute. You can see them making chocolate next door from the bar/lounge area which I thought was neat. Every time I've been I've sat out on the patio which gives you an amazing view of the bellagio fountains for when they go off.   My first experience was the best, got some brunch with a close friend. We got the bottomless mimosas. Blade, our server, was out for blood. I could NOT reach the bottom of my mimosa he kept filling it up even after a sip. I was in heaven, I get very cranky if I reach the bottom of my bottomless mimosa. They also had a yellow ghost bloody on the menu that was made with gazpacho and ghost peppers. BEST BLOODY MARY EVER! The yellow gazpacho  made the best base ever. Toe curling delicious.   I ordered the carnitas hash and it was amazing. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the egg yolk mixing beautifully with the carnitas and the potatoes. It was absolutely divine.  We finished eating and just sat around enjoying the beautiful weather out and people watching while still enjoying our endless mimosas. He served us them past 3 pm even though that's when brunch ended.  It was an absolute blast though, I'm surprised I was able to walk out of the restaurant, we probably had 15 mimosas.   At the end of the meal the server delivers a plate of dark chocolates with their logo on it, and every chocolate has a spell card. Some are for wealth, some are for fun, some are for wisdom. Either way it's a very cute touch and the chocolate is probably some of the best chocolate I've ever had.   The second time I went the server wasn't as enthusiastic with the mimosas. Obviously still got my 20 dollars worth but I did reach the bottom of my mimosa.   I ordered the chive waffle which was really good. They brought me hard boiled eggs, lox, chives, cream cheese, onions and capers I think. It was REALLY really good. My friends ordered the chicken and waffles which were the best chicken and waffles I had ever had.   It was only 11 am and paramedics were already carting someone off property on a stretcher. Gotta love vegas!",

He was super attentive to our table and was sure to never let our drinks go empty! Also, I need to include Christina she is amazing at her job! She made sure we were fully satisfied.  P.s. Rafael (tongue roll) was so good anything he suggested on the menu I bought including chicharones. Love the country boy vibe!",

The waitress was so slow. We had our water and ordered our food within five mins. After that we had to wait for 15 mins to get coffee and water refills. Whenever we needed something we had to wait a long time or go and find a waiter to help us. The spinach dip was good, but the salads were wilted and soaked with dressing. I did not finish mine. Then I had the chicken and waffles. One piece of chicken was perfect and the next was not all the way cooked. The waffles were dry as a bone and then we couldn't get enough syrup in time to have my waffle not be dry. I will not go there again. The one good thing was the valet. They were expensive but quick",

    "text": "A group of my friends and I stayed at the Paris Hotel for Labor Day weekend and spent that Monday holiday morning gambling in the casino. Eventually, when we got hungry, we debated on where we should go to eat. Somewhere close by and somewhere with great reviews. Then I realized, I have had HEXX kitchen bookmarked for a while now and it is located inside of the hotel, so we decided why not!   We arrived around 11:30am and it was brunch time. There was a 25 minute wait, so we spent our waiting time drooling over all the desserts they had in the HEXX chocolate bar next door. Everything looked so good, especially the ice cream sandwiches!! (I ended up getting one and omg, amazing!)  Once we got seated, we were overwhelmed by the amount of items they had on their brunch menu. We STRUGGLED to decide. Ultimately, we ordered an array of delicious brunch specialties and it was awesome!  Chilaquiles (3.5/5) I must say, these weren't bad. But they were not amazing. Plus, you will always get a dish of chilaquiles anywhere that will eventually become soggy. Not my thing really.  Corned beef hash (5/5) Now, this dish was so freaking good! Probably the best corned beef hash I have ever had! Highly recommend!  Breakfast croissant (5/5) The croissant was perfectly flaky and so buttery. Let me say that ALL croissant breakfast sandwiches should taste like this one! Nailed it for sure!  Meat omelet (5/5) This is what I call an omelet. No complaints. BOMB.  Carrot cake pancakes (5/5) Okay, okay. Now this right here had me craving pancakes for the rest of the week and I am not the pancake type. Waffles are my go-to, but oh my goodness, these were heaven!!  The four stars is because our service was not that great. We had to ask for water re-fills and it seemed like our food took a little longer than it should have. I don't know if it's because we didn't order alcohol, but the service was just alright. Part of the time I really wondered if we were forgotten about. But from my experience working in a restaurant, it seemed like they were transitioning and new servers were coming onto the floor because we really couldn't tell who our server was.   Anyway, I would still come back! The food was great and it would have been a great pair with their bottomless mimosas! Until next time!",

    "text": "Sugar Factory vs HEXX Spinning lollipops vs Chocolate   Locals and avid Vegas tourists understand what I'm saying. No lies, I loved the Sugar Factory. Everything from the ambiance, the food and the service. The concept of having a candy shop attached was cool. The spinning lollipops were fun but now very 3 years ago.  Now for Hexx, I really love their concept and the changes they made by opening up one side. Enjoying some sun, people watching and enjoying the Bellagio fountains is just part of The Strip. We were seated on the patio, so we could enjoy all three sports on the Strip.  We ordered the bacon and it was super crispyn. thought it good, but I'm not a fan of overcooked anything, so I guess it's a matter of taste. For my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was great but I found the chicken to be bland and dry. Chicken breast can dry pretty fast and that's what happened. I don't think I will order it again.  After brunch, my daughter and I shared the hot chocolate and wow it was good. I'm big on hot chocolate... Angelina's in Paris... Max Brenner... I like it a lot. HEXX has amazing hot chocolate, very rich and a good consistently.   The service was amazing. We weren't rushed and they were all very friendly.  When done, head next door to pick up some chocolates. Don't expect it to be the packaged cheap stuff you pick up at a grocery store. They serve chocolate here, it's the real deal.   I love the chocolate here. I was never big on the spinning lollipops anyhow. :)",

I stopped in HEXX, to wait for my husband who was @ the UNLV vs Duke basketball game ~ had some time to kill, was hungry had seen picks in Paris of their burger, to cold to wait outside @ Beer Park, saw an open table in the bar and the rest is history!!!     I kinda consider myself a burger addict or affecianado!!! Don't eat fast food burgers and consider Bachi Burger the burger to me measured against!!!! And the Hexx Burger stands up very solidly to Bachi. (In my opinion)       Not only does the burger look good ~ it's DEEEELISSSH. I don't know if it's the fully melted American cheese, the well done bacon or the chocolate bun.... YEAH! I know that sounds weird but it's different and not what you expect ~ but go Order, Look & EAT a HEXX burger you'll be very happy you did!!!",

I asked the server if we can still have the breakfast menu, since I heard HEXX is known for their breakfast. The server unfortunately couldn't give us the breakfast menu and we were forced to order from the lunch menu.   The lunch menu is definitely pricier than the breakfast menu, but we felt optimistic about this place.  I ordered the chicken BLT burger and it came with fries. I had one bite of the burger was it was BLAND all the way! Nothing too special about this $18 burger! The fries were average. I asked our server for a side of ranch dressing. The service was SLOW. It took a good 20 min just for ranch. And by the way, the restaurant wasn't that busy around that time. The ranch tasted like Hidden Valley ranch from the bottle. Ehhhh..  To summarize my review: slow service, overpriced & bland food (at least for lunch) & I wish we had the option to order breakfast instead! Definitely disappointed.  2 stars rating though because we had a view of the Strip.  But honestly I would rate this place 1.5 stars.",

    "text": "Had dinner here last night with a friend, and up until this morning at 3 am I would have given this place 4 stars - but at 3 am she threw-up all of her dinner and has been sick in bed all day.  I know this is Vegas, but we can't blame this one on alcohol as neither of us drank last night, nor did we eat anything else after we left the restaurant.  She's got all the signs of food poisoning.  Which really sucks because we're in town to attend a conference that we paid for out of our pockets, and now she's missed a full day of sessions.  We're praying that she'll feel better tomorrow.  So far the best she can do is small sips of Gatorade.  She ordered a pasta dish, I think it was one of the house specials.  I'm pretty sure one of the listed ingredients might have been egg yolk.  Looking back now, that seems odd - why list egg yolk unless it is raw - in which case - what the heck?  She thinks she remembers seeing that too but, at the time, not giving it much thought.   The location is amazing (right across from the Bellagio fountain).  As far as my dinner - it was okay.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip - which is one of the best I've ever had.  For my main course I had the fillet which was cooked exactly as I ordered (medium), but a bit dry and lacking any flavor other than when the pepper it was dusted with before cooking happened to touch my tongue.  There was a very small dollop of 'steak sauce' on the plate, I suppose it's there incase the pepper didn't work.  I tasted the sauce - nothing to rave about and I'd prefer something better than homemade A-1.  This space used to be occupied by the Sugar Factory... and I was really hoping to eat there.  It wasn't until we made the trek up from the Mandalay that I realized Sugar Factory was gone.  Another small positive note - Hexx just opened, literally.  I think last Friday (Feb 27th) was it's first night.  So the place was still fairly empty at 7:30 pm on a Monday night.    Might be empty because it's so new, or might be empty because my friend isn't the only one to have spent the next day puking up her dinner.  I visit Vegas a lot - and I'll keep an eye on their Yelp reviews to see if this was a one-time fluke.  Bottom line - should you go here?  If you want a great view of the fountain and fabulous spinach dip - give it a shot.  Just stay far away from anything else on the menu that might get you sick if it's not cooked/prepared properly.  Good luck!",

Yes, I said affordable. The servers are fresh, friendly, happy, energetic, fun, informative, helpful and kind! Sit in Tracee and Jordans section! The food....fresh, beautiful, nutritious, exciting, flavorful, elegant to look at. From the front desk to the servers to the kitchen they pay attention to detail. Did I mention the flavor of the food? AWESOME! Visiting for Moms 70th with my sister and we were not diappointed. From hangovers to batchelorette parties or a 70th bash, you want to eat and drink here. Great memories! Thanks Tracee and Jordan!",

The service left so much to be desired compared to what we had experienced at all the other restaurants we had gone to while staying in Vegas.  Not once were we ever asked how are meal was or if there was anything else they could bring us. We split the prime burger and was told it was far better than the Hexx burger that was no longer on the menu. Well our server was wrong. For starters if came out rare and because we were never checked on after it was served I went without eating as rare hamburger is not my thing. For $25 I expected better and I certainly expected better customer service. Hopefully others will have a better experience but this place will not be on my list on the next trip.",

I ordered something that came with icecream and it had like 2 little scoops, so I asked the manager Juan for more icecream for my 17.00 dessert and he proceeded to tell me it was 3.00 a scoop and I told him I refuse to pay Xtra for icecream when more should have been on my plate. Juan chose to lose a 17.00 dollar sale for the dessert and took it off the bill, when he should have pleased his customer and brought out 2 scoops. I had planned on coming back for breakfast tomorrow morning but I don't feel like I was excepted here. And to top it off My server Tom K seemed to have an attitude all throughout my dining experience.    I wrote a bad review on Hexx yesterday but I must say the General Manager Michael made our experience today very pleasurable. My server Adam was the best he made us feel how customers should feel when eating out. Side note come for breakfast and try the Chocolate banana pancakes there the best.",

    "text": "Hexx was next door to our hotel and we decided to try breakfast here one morning we were up early.  As soon as we walked up to the restaurant, I could smell a strong paint/varnish smell.  I noticed they were getting ready to open Beer Park on the roof and it looked like someone was working on the area.  We got a seat inside and I hoped the varnish smell would subside.  I ordered orange juice because I saw it was served in a carafe and assumed it was fresh squeezed.  I should have asked because it tasted like it came from a carton at the grocery store.  Unfortunately, the varnish smell started making me queasy and we left before eating.  We tried Hexx again another evening for dinner, and this time the varnish smell was gone.  We were seated at a table farthest from the windows.  It still had a great view of the Bellagio fountains just across the street.  I ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.  It's served in a mini skillet with tortilla chips and pita bread.  It was creamy and did not disappoint.  It was HOT though, and I burned my tongue - so maybe let it cool a minute before you dig in.  We also ordered one of their signature Hexx potions on the special drink menu that appeared to have smoke or mist coming from it.  We had to ask about it though, because $36 seemed pretty steep.  We learned it was actually a pitcher and not a single serving (you cannot tell from the photo) and we ordered the purple haze pitcher, which was a berry flavored drink.  The server brought out the pitcher and another cup and then proceeded to pour the contents of the cup into the pitcher and it immediately began smoking.  We figured there must be dry ice in the bottom.  We were given two straws and told to go to town!  The drink fizzed for a long time, at least 10 minutes!  It was tasty but not super strong, alcohol-wise.  My bf wasn't very hungry, so I was the only one who ended up ordering an entree.  I chose the Pappardelle, which was described as a pasta with wild mushroom, baby spinach, portabella cream and parmesan.  It was an average pasta dish and not very flavorful.  As a lover of all things pasta, I ate only about half and did not take the rest home.  I wouldn't order it again, either.  We skipped dessert and left once we'd finished our drink.  Service was satisfactory and nothing to complain about.  We did not get any chocolate with our check as another reviewer mentioned!

Jason was the best bar tender I've had in a long time. My party and I had the best experience imaginable. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. Ye recommended two of their signature options for our group. Both were amazing. He made us a set of shots for my friends birthday and just provided the best experience ever.  The experience we had was so much better than any other we had on the trip. It was so good that we went back the next day and had him make us more drinks. I those drinks hit me harder than mankind hitting the announcers table after being thrown off the top of the cage during the hell in the cell cage match in 1988. Again Jason was the consummate professional. This bar was fantastic and its staff is second to none.",

We had reservations and was seated immediately, but didn't seem that crowded (probably because it was already 1:30pm). Great food and atmosphere, I'd definitely recommend coming here for some recovery brunch. Make sure to make recommendations to avoid a long wait!   FOOD I ordered the chicken & waffles and omg you really do get what you pay for. Two HUGE pieces of fried chicken placed on top of a fluffy waffles, what more could you ask for???? The breading of the chicken was flavored just right and the chicken itself was juicy and tender. The waffle was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Ugh my mouth is salivating just reminiscing about it.   DRINKS We ordered 1 Purple Haze drink, which comes in a huge pourable & shareable jar. If we weren't so hungover, each of us would've gotten one. Great drink if you love berries.   SERVICE Service was on the fence. Our server was amazing, gracious, and engaging (totally regret not getting her name), but the food & drinks took way too long to come out. IDK if it just seemed longer because we were hungover, but still it was a long time. Plus it was around 1:30pm so I'd assume the brunch rush would be over.   Overall, we probably won't visit this place again because of the service, but if we don't find anything else, we'd come here.",

Honestly, there wasn't a thing that I didn't love. Real standouts were   Wagyu Beef \"Burger\" Shrimp Ceviche & Braised Short Rib.  I don't know if the Tempura Shrimp that we were served is on the regular menu; but dear God, I could live on that. I don't know how they did it, but it has spoiled me for all other tempura. I will return to eat a trough full of it soon.   The staff knocked it out of the park! Serving a very large group of picky people can be a nightmare, I'm sure. But each server that I  encountered was fun, friendly, and seemed honestly happy to be there (and trust me, this is not always the case on The Strip).   I'm sure you'll be made welcome in whatever you happen to be wearing (mostly) - but the atmosphere is nice-casual - leaning more toward the 'nice' at night. Street clothes are fine during the day, but you'll fit in wearing sharp goin-out duds at dinner time. Make Las Vegas Classy Again.  Congratulations, All -- Well Done! I look forward to returning for a sit-down experience with my Trough-O-Shrimp soon.",

That did give us the opportunity to walk around the candy store and they offered us a free sample of chocolate which was divine. The bottomless mimosas is definitely a deal that you can't pass up - it's not extraordinarily cheap, but it's not unreasonable either. The service was great - our server was very friendly, helpful and attentive. My mimosa flute was almost never empty! The atmosphere had an open and almost European kind of vibe, but the music was playing very loud and it was hard for us to hear each other when we spoke. I ordered the chilaquiles on the behest of the server and I'm so glad I listened to her. It was so much food I could barely eat half of it, but it was so tasty. The balance of the different components was perfect. The potato chips were a little soggier than I would have wanted, but I'm sure plenty of people prefer them that way. At the end of our brunch they brought a birthday cake to the table for our friend who was wearing a birthday crown and boa - we didn't even have to request it, they just provided it and it was not only beautiful but incredibly delicious. All in, I was originally skeptical about Hexx because it seemed a little too touristy, but I'm so glad that we came here. I was incredibly pleased with my experience!",

They do bottomless mimosas until 2 pm so it was a no brainer! 1 mimosa for $12 or bottomless for $23. The menu had a great variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian items. My husband decided on the eggs Benedict and I had the veggie burger. This is where one of the stars got docked. My husbands meal was a little bland and had something lacking. My veggie burger with fries was ok the other hand amazing! The patty was thick and not dry at all! The fries were some of the best I've had. Perfectly crispy and flavored with some sort of spice. The portion of my burger was huge where as my husbands wasn't as large. The inconsistency was a little weird. We checked in on the yelp app which allowed us one dessert on the house. I highly recommend the tiramisu! The presentation and flavor together made it so enjoyable. You get to pour the espresso over the cake.  The cream was perfectly sweetened and not over the top. I would suggest this place to anyone visiting Vegas! Wait for the patio seating for prime people watching while you enjoy a great meal.",

    "text": "Favorite brunch place in Vegas thus far!  Let's start with the service, I thought our Waiter looked a little bit stressed out while serving our table, since we had a party of 7, I forgot his name, but he did his very best to keep it professional, he was friendly and came by once in a while to ask us how we are doing while attending other customers. Since we had 7 people we had the opportunity to try a lot of the amazing food as a family style. But I especially think they did well with their carrot pancakes and the chicken waffle, they made the chicken so well!! Very crispy on the outside and very tender inside! very flavorful! The drinks were also amazing, we got the flamingo and the Elixir. I much much prefer the taste of the flamingo it is so fruity, I can really taste the guava I love guava!!! The Elixir was very fun to look at and great for pictures and videos, but after that flamingo drink nothing else can taste better! I would say the only item that I was not a super huge fan of was the pizza carbonara, I thought it was slightly dry but not the crispy kind of dry. Other than that everything else was fantastic! And it was a great touch when the waiter bought a small red velvet pastry for our friend who is getting married to congratulate her, it was nice that we didn't even ask for it! He was still very sweet even tho we can tell he was a bit overwhelmed.",

The maple bacon was amazing. Life changing, really. The fruit was incredibly fresh and there was a great variety of more exotic types of fruit than your standard grapes, blueberries, strawberries and melon. My husband, who doesn't usually eat fruit couldn't keep from stealing bites from my plate. The potatoes were indescribably good. A perfect crunch when you bite into it, with a smooth texture on the inside. They were seasoned quite well. The servers and hosts are attentive, warm and welcoming. Our favorite place on the strip.

After the extremely unprofessional behavior I witnessed I won't be returning to this establishment. During my last visit I overheard some extremely unprofessional remarks being made by a woman with blonde hair (I asked around & found out her name was Allison M., she looked like management). She was cursing & using foul language towards the employees ON the floor while guests were within earshot. One of the comments in question went something like this \"If you guys don't seat this side I am going to have a FUCKING panic attack.\" as well as this same woman addressing another employee & telling them \"You look like shit,\" again right on the floor as guests were walking by, one of which shot [Allison] a look of disgust before continuing on, passing the restaurant. Which I would've done had I been in their place to be honest. I honestly feel bad for the employees working under this woman as she doesn't seem to have a grasp on how or when to speak to those under her. The blatant condescending disrespect towards her employees is palpable & quite frankly disgusting. For these reasons I will not be coming back, I can only hope any future customers don't have to witness what I did.",

The French toast and bacon came out cold. The Frittata was all egg. Where was the chorizo and potato? Oh, according to the waiter it was in there. Where, we asked again? Finely chopped, those little dots he said as hubby combs through all the egg with his fork. We look at each other and shrugged. When the waiter left we said hmmm maybe finely ground like pepper?! Lol, wth? To top it off, no refills on our water... Not one...I know there's a water shortage, but c'mon. With all the great restaurants in Vegas this one seriously needs to step their game up.  1 star for the adorable patio. Awesome views of the Las Vegas strip and the Bellagio Fountains!",

We did have a 5 minute wait to be sat in the brightly lit modern coco cabana like restaurant but it was worth it. We order crab cakes for starters and they were delish! 3 patties made with what appeared to be the claw meat of the crab and served with an aioli sauce, they were flavored well and fried to perfection. Our party also order Chicken & Waffles, which featured apple and white cheddar waffles and a mound of fried chicken,  the Protein Omelet which featured egg whites, chicken, spinach and a delicious avocado foam, home fried potatoes and a huge english muffin and the highlight Cinnamon Roll Waffles served with a cream cheese spread. It was all delicious and filling and reasonably priced. A definite must try if you're brunching in Vegas as they also offer bottomless mimosas and a variety of bloody mary drinks for those suffering from that good ole Las Vegas hangover.   They also have a chocolate and dessert shop next door where you'll find gourmet chocolates, cookies, a variety of ice cream, candies, unique  beverages and coffee drinks. If you have a seeet tooth this is a sweet spot for you.",

Since there no longer was a giant Goblet to try, my  girls and I opted for the Mega Martini. Loved it! We had the berry mojito and it's a sight to see..! Also, a creeper. Before we knew it, we were leaning. The equivalent of 10 shots is in that drink... Loved it! All of us ordered different things and the food was great. We sat next to the iron fence and had an amazing view of the Bellagio and the fountain. The only downside is people, cool and not-so-cool, kept stopping us to ask what we were eating and how it was. Lots of flirting going on too. Can't be mad at that! I loved eating there, and we'll probably go again when we head back in May. Gotta say something about Josh, who made us an impromptu cocktail that night. Eat here!",

We were sat down and greeted by a lovely young lady named Melanie. She is a server assistant, which great customer service. She took out drink orders and told us our server will be greeting us shortly. We were greeted by one of the GREATEST servers I have ever had by the name of Tracy. Tracy was on it, answering every difficult question we had. She checked on us plenty of times and made sure everything was good. The food was delicious. One of my friends and I ordered the fresh farm eggs and French toast, and my other friend ordered the chicken and waffles. Everything was so delicious. We never saw the bottom of our mimosas due to Tracy coming to refill everytime we got a little low. Melanie and Tracy were so nice and very friendly to us and we appreciate the awesome customer service that was given to us. We will definitely return and hopefully have the #teamhustle helping us again. Thank you so much ladies.",

After a few bites the smell was gone. Desserts sounded really good, will be back to try them. They charge a concessions fee, shows up as \"cnf\" on the bill, can ask to have it removed.",

However, the food was fantastic and the ambience of the place is trendy and pleasing. It is a little noisy, perhaps because the seating arrangements are so close together and the room is open which creates acoustics of the voices over the background music. Still the food we had was delicious and the service was superb from the hostess to the waiters, we were always attended to with great attitudes. Their deserts are phenomenal and because we couldn't decide on one, we ordered them all. Definitely worth it!",

Had omlette that is $14 and you get 2 items.Each additional item is  $1. Coffee is too strong; rot gut. Potatoes were interesting and good. Crispy and hard on outside and cooked potato on inside. One breakfast can be shared. OJ is $6 a glass! View outside nice; great waitress first morning. Terrible service last time. Waiter took an hour the next morning to bring one omlette and oatmeal. Almost missed flight, think I am over it. Inside has nice decor but think it is now a pass. Go to Mon aMi Gabi next door instead for another patio view.

My friend who is a salad snob said her \"Simple Salad\" was one of the best she has ever had. I got the protein omelette which was very tasty. Our other friend ordered the sticky bun which was massive. Definitely will put you in a sugar coma if you try to eat the whole thing. The bowl of fruit was huge (definitely not the little side dish you typically think of) and has a great variety of fruits to snack on. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.",

We were going out for a night on the town, so this was the perfect place to start. Right across the street from the Bellagio fountains, we got to see three different shows from our table tucked away in a little private nook of the restaurant.   Service was great, dirty martini (with blue cheese olives!) was everything, and we had the crab cake, chopped salad, and blue cheese crusted sirloin all cooked to perfection! They even came out with a personal cake after I had mention via phone reservation we were celebrating the birthday! Will definitely recommend for future visitors!",

Server got the burger wrong for my 10 year old and left him sitting there for at least 15 - 20 minutes watching us eat our meal. They could've at least left him the fries to munch on while they make the right burger. We ended up cancelling the burger they were still making and going somewhere else to grab him something quick to eat since he was starving. We only had the salmon, short rib, and a glass of wine and the bill came out to almost $90. We left still hungry. It's never good when you leave a nice restaurant still hungry after paying a Benjamin for it.",

We sat inside, ordered a few drinks and a few appetizers to share. The drinks were very well mixed, and our food was outstanding, but three stars for the service!  Our waiter was terrible. He clearly looked and acted like he would rather have been anywhere but there; I so wish I remember his name! He brought us a second round of cocktails, at a sloth's pace I might add, and had a very hard time getting back to check on us. Or something. Then we turn around a see a table with a couple of drunk, scantily dressed ladies, and it all made sense! He was laughing and joking with them, while we and a couple of his other tables waited and waited for our bill. Not very impressive for a nice restaurant, sir.   The food and drinks, and overall atmosphere, definitely held our attention though, so I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

He was very knowledgeable about the menu items which helped us make the right choices. He gets five stars for that and service. The reason I gave only 4 stars has to do with the hostess. The restaurant wasn't very busy at the time we arrived. There were so many empty seats that some employees seemed to have nothing to do. For some reason however, we were put on a 20 minute wait with plenty of empty and clean tables inside and out. No one could give a reasonable reason why. I would recommend this place, but next time I'm asking for the manager if they say there's a wait.",

They didn't advertise their bottomless mimosas (I think since it was during the week) but when we asked they still gave us the deal. The food was really good and nice portion sizes. One of my favorite meals in Vegas for sure!",

    "text": "On a recent Christmas Holiday trip to Las Vegas where we stayed at Paris Las Vegas Hotel& Casino,we had breakfast at HEXX kitchen+bar. Upon entering and being ushered to the hostess and after requesting if we could sit indoors but near the windows, we were immediately escorted to a table right at the front of the restaurant that provided a view of the strip as well as the Fountains of Bellagio directly across the street. The waiter who oversaw our servers was named Sean and he,along with the rest of his team, provided very attentive service and our breakfast selections prepared exactly as we had requested. When we were ready to leave they even brought us additional coffee in 'to go\" cups,rather than just giving us what remained at our table. Excellent food and outstanding staff that provided one of our best dining experiences of our trip! We will definitely return and would highly recommend HEXX kitchen + bar.",

The happy hour tables were first come first serve and all of them were taken so we asked the hostess if we could sit somewhere else to get the happy hour. She spoke with the manager and we were able to get our own private booth! We ordered 2 hexx potion drinks... The magick dragon and the voodoo tea. The voo doo tea was extremely sour so we asked them to switch it out for another magick dragon which they were happy to do. The presentation of the hex potions were really neat because they poured the drink over liquid nitrogen which made the drinks really look like a potion!  We order a pepperoni pizza, a margarita pizza, grilled asparagus, and a chicken Caesar salad. Everything was delicious, especially the Chicken Caesar salad.   Overall, the presentation, food, and service was great.",

    "text": "This was our last stop in Vegas before the airport. A few years ago, my girlfriends and I had a memorable breakfast here - we still talk about the cinnamon roll waffles, so obviously we had to come back. It's fun to sit underneath the Paris Eiffel Tower and watch the Strip. We were seated quickly and got our drinks in short order. The cocktails are pretty pricey, so we skipped those and just got food.  My friend and I split a cinnamon roll waffle and a basic egg breakfast, reasoning that the protein in eggs would offset the sugar bomb that is the waffle. Totally works! ;) my other friend got the Benedict, which is served on a bed of has browns rather than an English muffin.  The wait for food wasn't great, and not was the service (friendly but slow), but when we eventually got the food - OMG! Get something that has the breakfast potatos! They are smashed and cooked til crispy and have Parmesan cheese and wow, just delish! Perfectly cooked eggs, crispy bacon, and to top it all off, a waffle made of cinnamon roll dough and covered in cream cheese frosting. Definitely a must for breakfast, as long as you aren't in a hurry.",

I then asked how long it would be for a table and she rolled her eyes and said ten minutes.  Thanks for the warm welcome.

I've been working in hospitality for over 10 years and Rachel M has been one of the best employees I've encountered. She was so warm and welcoming. She even wrote us a list of places to check out. Rachel M made this brunch the best I've ever had... and I brunch ALOT!!!",

    "text": "Came in for breakfast..it was decent. We were automatically led outside to eat without being given a choice to eat inside. When we asked to eat inside, it seemed an inconvenience but we were accommodated. Customers like choices. Pancakes were really good, came out hot. Our egg plates looked as if they were sitting around, waiting while the pancakes were cooking. We had to ask for extra syrup; one shot glass size syrup is not nearly enough for 4 fluffy pancakes. Even the extra shot glass of syrup wasn't enough but I didn't have the heart to ask for more. I ordered coffee..pretty good but my complaint for the coffee refill is this; the coffee canister hangs off the tub that holds multiple canisters of ice water. The coffee refill was lukewarm at best. Because it was lukewarm, it tasted bitter and wasn't worth finishing the cup. This doesn't make sense to me. The server was pleasant and eager to please. The complimentary chocolates at the end were a nice touch. They promote the connecting dessert store next door and it was a nice tasty treat to finish the meal. Overall, the presentation was nice..good pancakes, potatoes and service. Not sure it's worth the $60 for breakfast but that's standard fare in Vegas. Probably won't go again for breakfast..a crepe from La Creperie will probably suffice.",

There are far better ways to spend $35 than paying for the opportunity to suffer through this food.   Offering a shot at redemption, I returned a couple days later for brunch. And left regretting it too.  The Veggie Quiche was inconsistently cooked, and somehow, really greasy. The potatoes were served with substance that resembled a house speciality Ketchup but was actually a strawberry jam and butter puree. Because Vegas, right?",

    "text": "Just ate here with a Groupon and won't be back. The temp here in Vegas is in the 40's yet the front door was propped open to attract customers walking by. At first I felt sorry for the hostess who was wearing a winter coat. Then I felt bad for me as I was freezing my entire meal and I'm from Chicago! Apparently it's more important to entice new customers than take care of your current ones. Obviously the food, once served got cold really fast.   I ordered the soup which was excellent and the smothered fries which is supposed to have pulled pork in it. I tore the fries apart and found one small bite size piece of meat. When I questioned our server about this, he could have cared less. But that didn't surprise me as he could have cared less about anything. I requested salt and pepper when our food was delivered. I ended up having to get up and get it from a table by us because he just disappeared. Meanwhile don't forget, the dining room is freezing and my soup is getting colder by the minute.  People next to us ordered coffee, got it, but didn't have spoons. They requested spoons several times and again the waiter just disappears. I'm sure their coffee got cold while waiting for something to stir it with. The garlic bread I ordered was burned. We had to laugh and said it was just like home. But seriously what kind of chef burns bread and then sends it out of the kitchen? What wait staff professional would serve it??  So, in a nutshell, service was bad, restaurant was freezing, my food was ill prepared and no one cared. The manager came to our table to swipe my Groupon and couldn't be bothered to ask about our dining experience. The high prices here will deter most people. Having been to Vegas dozens and dozens of times I still get shocked when a glass of pop at your table is $4.95. It's truly highway robbery.   I HIGHLY recommend any other of the many dining options close by. Mon Ami Gabi right next door is 1000x better for about the same price.",

The prime rib took the jewel crown here. It cut through like butter, melts in your mouth, perfectly seasoned and salted. Just amazing. Probably the best prime rib I've ever had. We also tried their truffle fries which was fantastic as well. This restaurant is priced very well considering the food!  We appreciate the good service. It's a nice restaurant with a great ambiance.

I made a reservation and requested to be outdoors facing the the strip and that is exactly what I got.  It's a perfect location because you can view the Bellagio fountains across the street and just people watch. Our wait staff was fabulous and attentive.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and a midori sour, both were excellent.  We also tried their famed Hexx pitcher which was neat and worth trying atleast once but I would not get again because the price is a bit ridiculous for me. On your way out you can view where they mix and make their chocolates.  Overall this place was a very nice place for any meal.",

Our server was fantastic! Really wish I could remember her name, but the service any place we went in Vegas was really just wonderful. Every server was top-notch!  We ordered the Colossal Bloody Mary to split between 4 girls. It was huge and came with a king crab leg, shrimp, bacon, and pepper skewer.   The food was average and good enough to combat a hangover. The one shining star to the meal was the pecan sticky bun! OMG order this if nothing else because it was so so good. Everyone in the group order an omelette, which came with an english muffin and side of potatoes. The potatoes were tasty; potatoes roasted and topped with parm. I didn't care much for the meat omelette since there was just too many random meats in it, like the pork wasn't very good and especially not mixed in with chicken and bacon.  Atmosphere was cute with an open dining room and doors that open into the patio area so the space feels very large. Decor was light, neutral palette and reminds me of a Santa Monica vibe.",

Although the Benedict plate seemed a bit small, it was delicious and in my top 5 list now...Breakfast Republic's version in San Diego is on that list as well.  No issues changing the English muffin on the eggs plate for toast and the potatoes that came with it were very good.  Great service for how busy it was, I would go back just for the Benedicts again.",

We did have a reservation so we got seated right away. No matter from where you seat, the view and the decor of this place make the experience better. Our waiter was really nice. He suggested couple of dishes and he was on point. Besides ordering from the menu, we algo used the Groupon offer for wine and cheese tasting which we had it at the end of our meal so we took our sweet time to enjoy everything. The food menu has a little bit of everything; for meat lovers like me as well as for vegetarians. I loved everything I had. We got to see the fountain show across street and that's pretty cool. I highly recommend this place. Food was freshly made and the atmosphere is just perfect either to enjoy a good conversation or just to relax and enjoy a good meal. Loveeeed it!!!",

Little did we know that the dining experience (brunch) would blow us away. I started out with a berry bowl, which was really good. Then came the main course: Hexx Benedict for me and Protein Omelet for my wife.  The presentations were simple and very eye-appealing. Loved the asparagus topping the whole of egg benedict. The ham and the thinly sliced potatoes were really well complementing the dish.  Protein Omelet was really, really good. It was nice and moist and fluffy. Far from all the omelets we've had in the past. The guacamole was a very nice addition to the dish. Adds a very nice flavor to the whole dish.  This is one brunch we're not going to forget anytime soon and will reminisce for weeks to come!  Ps. Forgot to mention our server, Enrique. Very attentive. Very courteous. Right on point.

    "text": "I went to Hexx with a very large group for brunch one Sunday as our last big hurrah in town. Hexx did a wonderful job seating our party of about 12 as well as keeping us entertained before being seated. Once seated, our waiter introduced himself promptly and we all loved him, he was fun and dynamic. Several of my friends ordered the bottomless mimosas to get the party started. After ordering our food, we had a strange encounter with the kitchen staff... as they were bringing out our food (which was brought individually, not on one of those big platters), the girl carrying the food approached my friend and set his food down very quickly in front of him, knocking over his mimosa and spilling it all over the table and him. At this point, she turned to all of us and scolded us, saying \"You guys are going to have to move your drinks, that whole situation could have been avoided.\" She didn't apologize, offer to refill his drink... she was blatantly rude. Mind you this is a busy restaurant, we did not know our food was coming, and he was the first to receive his food, which was our only tip anything was coming. I was LIVID. I was literally shaking and my voice started cracking I was so angry. We all kind of jumped on her and she just got angry and walked away, she was very unprofessional. We told the waiter and he was very understanding and assured us that the restaurant did not stand for that kind of behavior and that she was scheduled for a sit-down meeting with the manager at the end of her shift to discuss her behavior because it was unacceptable (the waiter's term, not mine). After a few minutes, she came back and gave an obviously forced apology and quickly walked away. I did think it was a little strange they did not comp my friend's mimosas or give him a free coffee or anything, especially since he was so nice about the whole ordeal (he kept his cool while we all got mad on his behalf), but it was nice to know that the restaurant did not endorse this behavior.  As for the food... I had ordered a meat omelet and was impressed by the taste. The omelet contained bacon, sausage, pork, chicken, and cheddar cheese... mmm. It also came with a sort of breakfast potatoes and an English muffin. I rather enjoyed my food and everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy theirs as well.  All in all, I appreciated the waiter sticking up for us and telling the manager about the way were treated, but the whole ordeal sticks out in my mind as one of my more frustrating dining experiences. I don't necessarily believe that is indicative of the restaurant as a whole and therefore would not say I will never come back here, but if I do, it will be at someone else's recommendation, not because I truly want to come back.",

My friends and I found ourselves singing along to the music because this place truly has all of the jams. Also, the manager walks around and parties with the customers which was very very lit. Overall, 5/5 stars -- would come again and probably one of the best parts of my whole Vegas trip. ",

The place was mostly empty, and service was attentive, and food came out quickly. We had the steak and egg (real good, although pricy), the eggs Benedict (delish!), Chilaquiles (real good) and the pancakes (awesome!). We sat outside on the patio, as the inside is incredibly loud. Place is huge!  We will possibly come here again, but this not a cheap date. Again, they milk the fact they are on the strip and do nothing for locals (which most places do usually). That was disappointing.  They need to care more for locals. They don't. 4 stars.",

I've been here two years in a row for brunch now and I really enjoy it.   This year we got the carrot cake pancakes and the chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were a little dry and definitely needed the syrup but pretty good once you added the syrup. The carrot cake pancakes were amazing. They were like eating a dessert. I would definitely get them again. I tried a bit of what my sister got - the chilaquiles which was very good.   It can be a little pricey depending on what you get at brunch but not too bad.   All in all this is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. There's always a line if you aren't a diamond rewards member though so get there early or be ready to wait.",

We feel such a racism from the waitress who doesn't stop asking where we from and the host who kept asking us where we from and why we speak a different language in them restaurant.   A very bad service , everything took so long so many people working there but no one wants to help .  And a waiter that kept looking at us and laugh for no reason .  The most is the manager of that place Chris that didn't want to even tell us his name because he probably was afraid that we will complain about him .  They over charge us 8$ for 2 orders of bread that we been told by the manager that it comes with the food the we order and its also written on the menu . We asked from him to cancel the over charge but he didn't want and was so rude to us ask for our card and he got us really scared .   They over charge us for any sub we wanted to get which normally it's substitute so it's not supposed to cost even tho we wanted the most basic stuff instead of meet a slice of tomato they charged 2$ how is this even possible.   Bad service , racist , the food not good at all for 4 stars , the worst manager I've ever seen , over charging , too much waiting , very expensive for no reason .  They even take 4.5% on top of every bill for no reason at all .   A place that just want to rip off nice people who walk down the strip",

Great atmosphere, open and bright, and a good view of the Fountains at the Bellagio with seats on the patio or towards the back. There are bottemless mimosas, FYI (imperative for a good brunch). Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the Corned Beef Hash. Somewhat of a smaller portion than I expected based on the size of the pancake stacks and sandwiches others ordered. But lemme tell ya, delicious! And with the croissant that came with it, the meal did end up being filling. I drank a Thyme Moscow Mule, yum!! And had a granola parfait before my main meal that was tasty. #Gluttony. I did taste someone's cinnamon roll...so sweet and tasty!! No one from our large party was disappointed. Thanks to our waiter Steven (sp?) for the great service. I'll be back again!!!",

In the land of uber and high roller everything, HEXX offers a \"more reasonable\" priced menu with Ruth's Chris-type quality.  Every was essentially on point, including the service. The drinks, were not only refreshing, but pleasing to the eye and extremely well balanced. The mashed potatoes were super creamy and flavorful and the sprouts were well seasoned and crispy.   The main courses of course, the proteins, ribeye and prime rib were perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned. My only grievance is the dessert which is some sort of fusion of a bananas foster and a churro, should have been perhaps served warm. Even with that, I found this place outstanding.",

We started off with the Chipotle Guacamole, ordered the Jambalaya for our main course, and then finished with an Aztec Chocolate cake. The food was excellent, but my only critique is that he Jambalaya was a bit spicy and could have had more flavor. Overall, it was a wonderful experience!",

The hostess was not friendly and our server while friendly was not attentive to our table and overcharged the bill.  First the fruit plate which was ordered early did not arrive at the table. We asked the server who delivered our food for additional needs and he never returned.   The only great service was from a new hire named Todd who was attentive and diligent.  This breakfast was not a peak time so management needs to upgrade the customer service of its restaurant.",

The reason why is we will sit on the balcony next to the strip to yes enjoy the fresh air.   But with my devious mind I enjoy watching the drunks from the night before walking or should I say trying to walk by to catch the bus or walking to the next hotel.  Also it is fun to watch the ladies of the evening go by then come back with their catch also.  So I tell my wife that we are having breakfast and a show.  The food is fantastic.  The service is fantastic also.  I believe our waitress' name was Johanna.  She you give a good impression about yourself and then you come back she will remember you.  She remembers us and where we are from and kind of what we enjoy doing.  It makes feel like family.  Thank you Johanna.",

Breakfast is easy, but that doesn't mean it's always good. For some reason, finding good breakfast places on the strip (aside from buffets) is pretty difficult. Perhaps it's because people aren't typically awake in time?... This was one of five places we found we wanted to try, and ended up being one of three places we actually enjoyed. The service was great; our server was personable and easy-going, not too loud or pushy. He checked in frequently to ensure we were enjoying our meals. I ordered the banana bread French toast, and let me just say that it is THE most delicious French toast I have ever had. The toast had the consistency of banana bread, but wasn't as dry. The flavors were SPECTACULAR. Caramel drizzle...and fresh berries! Wow, seriously the best. My one issue with it was my own fault...I added the syrup they provided in a small bowl, and it definitely became inedible towards the end because of how sweet it was. Whatever you do, don't use the syrup on this dish! It's perfect and sweet enough without it.",

Corn beef is mushy and not at all crispy.  Where's the toast? No toast came with the corn beef hash with poached eggs.  Crab cake was very good.  Returned chiliquillas.  Didn't care for. Egg on top was over hard. Not sure why as they didn't ask for a preference but would not expect an egg that was hard cooked. Meh.  Got the regular egg breakfast with bacon and potatoes. This was good.  Potatoes nice and crisp, good portion of bacon.  Didn't care for the homemade English muffin.  No nooks and crannies for the butter and their delicious raspberry puree to land.  Next visit will try Mon Ami Gabi which is right next door.  This place was crowded and looks good on yelp and website.  Same prices for breakfast and they give you a loaf of crusty bread and butter.  I had to pay 4 something for a side of white toast at HeXX.",

Took 20 minutes for us to get our cocktails (jack and coke, and an old fashion) I opted for the ribeye and it took a little over 45 minutes to receive. Needless to say it was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. I also shared a side of the mashed potatoes with my co worker since I was told that a side was for 2 people, but it wasn't even enough for me. At $10 the side seemed like a complete ripoff. Overall this restaurant has good ambience and very good steak, however they do seem to be lacking in the speed of service as well as portion size for their sides.",

Even though I sat in the patio outdoors, the fountains were still on the other side of the street and blocked by trees. You can really only hear the loudest blasts of water.  In any case, the food here is pretty good! In my group, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip (comes with pita and chips), salads, jambalaya (very spicy), a burger, and I ordered the pappardelle. Good service as well.  Walk out into the main part of Paris' casinos to get to the bathroom!",

It's a great location and a beautiful restaurant, I honestly expected the food to be the same. But I was disappointed, sadly. I couldn't decide on what to order, but I kept seeing the prime rib French dip being served at multiple tables and it looked delicious so I went with it. After waiting 20 mins to be seated (mind you, the restaurant was half empty) and another 25 mins to finally get my food, I immediately regretted my food after 1 bite. It was SOOOOOO bland. Like no flavor at all! I shared it with friends at the table because I didn't want to waste it. The customer service was friendly but so slow. After we asked for our check it took our server 10 mins to bring it to us and another 15 to bring it back, what a mess. Probably won't be returning.",

We were seated immediately in the balcony facing the Bellagio Fountains. Awesome view. We were here the weekend of EDC so it was perfect for people watching. Weather was blazing hot but they have misters to help. Our waiter was really nice and full of personality.   We had one of their signature cocktails which comes in a cute jug and presented to you in a spectacular way, as our waiter said \"it's a big production\". I had the Prime Rib medium rare. It was on point with plenty of fatty parts per our liking. We ordered mushrooms to compliment the steak which were delicious and tender. The side dish orders a la carte are big and can totally be shared.   My man had the salmon on quinoa beans. His dish was also amazing. The salmon was nicely cooked. Both our meals were large in quantity not allowing for dessert space. Pricing wasn't bad. We will definitely be back and highly recommend the place.",

It was ridiculously loud. I asked to be seated at another table and was told I would have to go back in the line (which was now an additional 35 minute wait. This was by management. Totally unacceptable. On the quiet side of the restaurant there were tons of empty tables that they could have easily put us in, if it weren't for small minded manager. Believe me there was no way that manager would have sat at the terrible table we were given. I rarely write reviews this bad, but this was an epic fail in the part of management. We left and went to eat elsewhere.   We could have stayed in the bar and not have waited for the worst table.",

I gave this place a shot during my visit this year and I like it almost as much.  Obviously, Hexx still has the great patio area with a fantastic view of the strip. The staff is friendly and service as good as I remember.  I went twice the last time I was in Vegas and got cinnamon roll waffles and carrot cake pancakes. Both gave me the \"I know I shouldn't be eating this for breakfast but it's soo good\" feeling I would get at Sugar Factory. Although I can't help but feel Sugar Factory would have served both with ice cream...",

Our server was friendly and attentive-my coffee was never more than half empty before he would stop by to refill it. The inside of the restaurant has lots of windows and light-colored furniture/decorations giving it a great light and airy feel. There is also a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. The food was okay. There was nothing wrong with it, but I would have been as happy with the Waffle House equivalent for about half the price (I had coffee and the farm fresh eggs with chicken sausage). The friend I was eating with had French toast, which they said was good.",

    "text": "So I've eaten here before, after 12 AM. This time it's a bit earlier. We waited maybe 5-8 minutes to be seated inside. Our waiter was just okay. He was semi attentive in the beginning and then once our dinner came out, he disappeared. Never came back except maybe once to ask how things were.  I did notice that he was always at the table next to ours, but never at ours. That was irritating. He came back at the end to delicer our check, and that was it. Expecting a tip for what? That I don't even remember his name isn't surprising.   It also was a nagging comment in my head that maybe he didn't want to wait on a group that looked like they wouldn't tip as much as the table next to ours. I get that all the time when I go out, I'm 30 and I tip based on service. If my service is terrible, do I think you deserve 15% or more. No. If you did amazing maybe you'll get tipped 20%. I guess it was the attitude that out waiter put off was not very pleasant. I want to say his name started with an M? Older gentleman, I think he wears glasses.    On the other hand, the gentleman replenishing our waters and getting us boxes for our leftovers was great. Spencer, good friggin job. We joked throughout the meal about leaving a pitcher of water at our table, because he was frequently back refilling all of our waters. As soon as our cups were either half full or empty, he was there.  I'm hoping he got some of the tip we left and it didn't just go to our lazy waiter. He took away our dishes right away.   Okay now onto the food.  So the menu is alright. We ordered the Caesar salad, seafood on ice, braised short rib, wagyu burger, brussel sprouts, broccolini, and the mushroom risotto.  The Caesar salad was not bad. The seafood on ice was okay. The crab legs were super cold and tough to eat without a small fork. The prawns were slightly overcooked. The tuna poke, shrimp ceviche, and lobster salad missed their mark. The garnishes on the plate were mostly inedible. Not a good choice.    We ended up asking for clarified butter for the crab. The lobster was not bad, it wasn't over cooked and was tender.    Hands down, the braised short rib was the best thing I've ever had there. It was the size of my forearm and the meat was just fall off the bone. There could have been more sauce that they braised it in on the plate.  The mashed potatoes were tasty, but a bit gummy. The acidity of the Brussel sprouts on as garnish was a bit much.   I ended up eating the nicely charred brocoolini. That with short ribs and mash was delicious. I would definitely order this again.   The wagyu burger was like an burger. The taste was alright, and the texture good. But it came out rare when we asked for medium. The pepper bacon was thick cut, good flavor. The fries were forgotten among all the food we had. Not sure if it was $23 amazing.   The mushroom risotto needed to be cooked a little longer. When the rice still has a bite to it, and it wasn't creamy like risotto should be. The starches did not release. Risotto is a timely dish. You rush it, it doesn't come out right. Mom said flavor was good, but texture and execution were not.   Overall I would come back. The view was great. Got to see the Bellagio fountain show.",

My wife, who's gluten intolerant, got the Hexx Benedict which was just scrumptious! The typical poached eggs and sauce were placed on top of a bed of stacked cut potatoes. (It was so delicious we're going to try and recreate it at home!) I got the eggs and bacon- which is typically a simple plate, but they managed to make it both complex in flavor and presence.  Also, I can imagine this place gets pretty packed so I'd recommend either going early in the AM or making a reservation- they also have bottomless mimosas for $23, so in theory you could spend hours here!",

Pricing:  3 plates & an iced tea cake out to $90ish with tip. Not surprising bc its right off the strip & looks bougie.    Service: Ehh, our waitress wasn't the most attentive person to us. The servers were great, nice & were more helpful than her.  Took me to be almost finished eating before i could ask for an iced tea.   Would i come here again? Nope.",

I made reservations in advance just in case of a wait, but when we arrived for our 9:30 meal, there were still plenty of tables. We were there on a Saturday morning but I think for a holiday weekend, its still recommended.   Our server was Steven and he was very nice and attentive. I had got the corned beef and he recommended the croissant with it and it was very much needed. Why? Well, they have bottomless mimosas for $24! It's totally worth it because they constantly keep your glass filled. Don't be surprised by the size of the glass because they are monitoring it and the refills are always coming. My food was very good and I loved the veggies in my meal. Everyone else in my group also enjoyed their food and I have a feeling that we'll be back here because their menu had many other items that I wanted to try.  If you need a good breakfast and brunch place WITH mimosas (or not), I highly recommend this place. They also have tables on the patio if you want a view of the Bellagio fountains but it was cold and I was fine being inside.",

Great place to park is in between Paris and Bally's hotel. The entrance is on the strip. They have a great Happy Hour between 4-7p, which we couldn't do because we had our little one. When we came in we were welcomed and seated right away! They sat us where we still had a great view of the Bellagio water show, but we were inside where it's cool. Our server Jasmine was super awesome and answered transparently with choices of food. We ordered a Purple Haze Potion that definitely did the trick ;) for an appetizer we ordered the Spinach Dip, which was super yummy. They have a kids menu and the pizza is enough for TWO KIDS for the parents who knows their lil ones don't eat much.  I ordered the Shrimp Limone which the brown butter carrots and spinach were cooked to perfection and was the perfect blend with my side ordered of fluffy mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Short Rib with a side of their macaroni cheese. The ritz crackers gave the Mac and cheese the perfect little crunchy taste. The short rib had these red peppers and Brussels sprouts that were super delicious. One point to add in, if you're torn between Prime Rib and Short Rib...my boyfriend suggests the Prime Rib. Finally they have the option of a complimentary cupcake if you're celebrating a birthday or this raspberry lemon flavored cupcake stack (don't know the name, but Jasmine showed me it) they brought both! My boyfriend hates attention but I always gotta embarrass him lol!",

Finally asked for manager who fixed the problem and service from that point was improved.  Burger on the brunch menu was good, but chipotle mayo with fries made that show. Yogurt with fruit and cereal was delicious as yogurt had pretty creamy texture.  I would not mind coming back and hopefully get an improved service!!!",

I order the chicken and waffles. The portion were a good size for an individual person and it was delicious. My friends were torn between the different flavor of pancakes they offer, so the servers said she can give them both the pancakes so my friends could try them both. The buss boys were very tentative and constantly checking on us... water refill or coffee refill. The servers and bussers were friendly and the whole environment of the restaurant were great. The price of the brunch were ideal, especially being in the Vegas Strip. Definitely would come back to this restaurant.",

I wanted to see some sites so we waited. Once we were seated we noticed that we had about 15 minutes left for unlimited mimosas but our great waiter let us know we were safe because we sat before the 2pm cut off. We ended up going with a different drink, the Magik Dragon for $36. Which ended up being a shared drink with three straws (there were three of us). It was good and filling enough. I had the veggie omelette which scrumptious. Service was great. Very cool place. I would go again.",

We ordered a variety of things from French toast to eggs benedict. The time to get the food was a slow and it wasn't packed being a Wednesday. I know some places do run a bit slower to allow time for apps, visiting, etc. and no one complained at our table, so it's all good. I'd say it took a solid 20 minutes but the wife says it was closer to 30 mins before the food was served.  Everything was very good, eggs were all cooked perfectly and the French toast was very good. The bacon was a little undercooked for some of the folks but it was how i like it...not so crisp that it breaks into pieces but still a bit soft.  I'll be back again and do recommend a visit if you're in the area.",

We sat close to the bar and got excellent service from the bartender. They were playing some nice live music, and everyone loved their food and drinks. The second time we went here was for brunch a couple days later. We didn't have reservations but were seated immediately. Our waitress was super friendly and had a fun sense of humor. She provided excellent service as well, and the brunch food was great. If you sit outside in the patio you get an amazing view of the fountain across the street, and the strip overall. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Can you say Sunday Funday?! If you're looking for an affordable (at least by Vegas means) bottomless mimosa brunch for the weekends, HEXX is a great spot to get the mid-morning party started!  Located in the Paris hotel, it's literally steps off a Las Vegas Blvd. You can sit in the restaurant or on the elevated patio (makes for great people watching) and get a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the general hustle & bustle of the Las Vegas Strip!  Hands down, one of my favorite items includes the CARROT CAKE PANCAKES! You get a huge stack (4) pancakes covered in candied nuts and cream cheese frosting. They put shredded carrots in the buttermilk batter and boy it just hits the spot. If you LOVE carrot cake, I highly suggest that you stop by HEXX! The maple syrup comes on the side...and let's this sugary treat is basically like eating carrot cake for breakfast. Goes perfect with their coffee and an order of carrot cake pancakes is only $13...easily shareable as well!  Of course, when it comes to Vegas...everybody will have a different opinion on what's overpriced and what's a good deal. HEXX to me, is pretty cheap, considering that all of the brunch entrees were under $20. Everybody in my group was satisfied with the food and service here.   Solid 4 stars! I'd be back just for the carrot cake pancakes!  Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice? $24 for bottomless mimosas!",

I said yes. It should be noted that I rarely say anything and can't remember ever sending something back (I guess the bloody was strong). I got the eggs Benedict for my re-do. They would have been great but they were room temperature and took another hour and 15 minutes. The waiter/bartender (I sat at the bar) was so nice but clearly overworked and it took forever to get service. All in all it was a less than mediocre dining experience, but if you're looking for a bloody this is a good place if you're willing to wait.",

We started with the charcuterie appetizer - 2 cheeses, 2 cured meats and a giant pretzel with condiments.  It was huge and decent quality.  2 simple salads were also good.  3 of the wines came just after the salads - decent wines, small (2 oz) pours.  Unfortunately the rose & white were served cold but were room temperature within minutes because of the small size glasses.  Promotion (still today) lists sea bass which was taken off the menu.  It also lists 14 oz ribeye, but menu price is now higher than promotion value.  After discussion, we got the ribeye, but it was the smallest 14 oz steak I've ever had - more like 10 ounce.  Way over cooked - ordered med rare and it was grey all the way through.  Venetian cheesecake was mediocre.  We get better cheesecake at Outback.  Not worth the money, even with the promotion.",

My weekend roomie found a few good places on the Strip including Hexx! They take reservations, and our party of 5 in the late evening was no big deal. My roomie and I arrived first, and they seated us promptly. Our waiter greeted us the second we sat down and offered us water options while waiting for our other friends to arrive. He provided amazing service the entire evening.  I made sure to order one of the house drinks-the Hypnotizing Strawberry- and do not regret it! Great blend of alcohol and flavors. All 5 of us ordered different entrees and loved them all! I got the Short Rib meal that includes horseradish mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. It was almost too beautiful to eat, but I ended up devouring my meal. One of my most-favorite meals I've ever eaten. All of the flavors blended together beautifully.",

The meat was tender, flavorful, and the portions were more than enough to fill my S/O and myself. The sea salt fries had excellent texture, color, and taste.  The ambiance inside was clean and upscale. The staff was very friendly and accommodating when we requested a specific table outside along the strip. Our waiter was chummy and interesting.  The bill for both of those entrees as well as a shrimp appetizer came to about $120 including 20% tip. A fair price for the food and a prime spot sitting outside across from the Bellagio, taking in the view of Vegas while the hustle and bustle moves about below us.  Recommended! Just be sure to grab a seat outside and enjoy the patio.",

I drink decaf coffee, and I'm accustomed to the low priority many restaurants give to my crowd, but the cup I received was both tepid and watery. When the waitress asked how we liked our coffees, I politely stated that it was not good. She seemed hesitant to take it away until I asked for a double latte in its place. Another person delivered a cappuccino (not a latte) five minutes later, and it was almost pure milk with virtually no taste of coffee. The waitress delivered our food and asked about the latte. Again, I politely told her that it was simply milk. Clearly showing that she had had enough of me, she said, \"well, that's the machine, not me,\" and walked away. I was hoping such a good time with my companion that I decided to just let it go. I wondered if perhaps she would exclude it from our bill, but no, when we were paying I noticed that the $7.49 cappuccino was there. We had other things to do, so we just paid and left. We won't be going back there.",

I wouldn't go through the hassle of this restaurant (parking, waiting, etc) to come back here.

I loved every bit of the patio set up, the inside dining was really beautiful, the portraits on the wall were pretty amazing as well.      Listen to this, this was the best brunch spot we ever tasted here, we came back again today. The great thing about it, we got our amazing waiter Raphael again. If you ever go here, make sure you ask for him. He's efficient, fast, and very professional.  Oh yea...they have some really great bloody marys, coffee, and lemonade.   Anywho...i could go on and on. But I'll just share pics and comment accordingly. Thanks for reading, until next time.",

We waited a bit at the hostess station and someone finally came over to tell us we had to go to the front of the restaurant to be helped there.  (A little sign may have been helpful!).  The hostesses were all in little black dresses, the wait staff was all dressed in nice uniforms.  Just about the time we thought that maybe we were a little underdressed and not suited for Hexx, our server came over, threw her weight all on one hip and said, \"Can I help you guys?\"  I instantly felt at ease.  :)  I had the Farm Fresh Eggs which came with bacon, potatoes, and an English muffin.  I also ordered the Berry Bowl.  My husband got the corned beef hash and our son ordered chicken and fries from the kid's menu (another sign that they're family friendly -- they have a kid's menu and crayons).    Our food was superb.  At first look my potatoes looked kind of gnarly, but oh, they were so tasty!  I could have done without the black burnt bits on my plate, but no big deal.  Everything else was fantastic. We shared the berries -- strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.  So wonderful!  It was a little spendy but it was our only Vegas meal so we went ahead and enjoyed ourselves.  I would definitely recommend Hexx and I look forward to returning!",

    "text": "The Hexx Kitchen definitely has a limited menu and has too few wait staff for the overwhelming number of people going. We had a reservation for 10 AM on a Saturday for 6 people that we made a couple of days prior to the date and it still took a while for us to be seated. There is self parking in the Paris hotel for free for the first less than an hour but for an hour to two it is $9. We asked how long the meal would take because we were trying to make it to the Day Club prior to 12 and they said an hour, but that definitely didn't happen. It took over an hour and a half to order, get our food and go.   We ordered the cauldron (~$40) which had Prosecco and orange juice. I didn't like it because there was no hint of sweetness, however, for $40 we had enough for six people to have two cups and we got to take home three to go cups of it.   Here's my biggest qualm about this place. I ordered the egg platter because it was the cheapest item on the menu and it was still $15. I didn't find any appeal in anything else and really just wanted eggs. The food took 20 minutes to come out and everyone else who ordered eggs Benedict, the po boy and the burger got their food first. They all started eating and 15 minutes later they finally found my order and all that it had was three eggs, one English muffin and two chicken sausages. I was asked if I wanted to ORDER anything else while waiting but we were already on a time crunch and it would come AFTER I would get my food so there was no point in ordering more food. They didn't even offer to do anything while I watched all of my friends finish their meals. When I got my meal, the eggs were cold, the potatoes bland as all hell, the muffin hot and really good, and the chicken sausages tasted like they were filled with cardboard. Absolutely horrid. For $15 and a 35 minute wait I was absolutely pissed. I didn't even finish my meal at all.",

The restaurant is beautiful and has terrace seating right on the strip (as well as indoor seating for a more quiet dining experience).    I ordered the shrimp, which came with a puree, roasted carrots and crispy ham! IT WAS TO DIE FOR! I was literally sad when my meal came to an end!!!!

My friend and I split a Chopped Shrimp Salad and Cheesy Garlic Bread. The salad was huge and easily enough for two people. It was fresh and delicious and the dressing was delicious, I just wish they had put a little less of it. The salad was a tad over-dressed for us which made it taste a little salty. Also, the shrimp was perfectly grilled but I'd have liked to see a couple of more of them for the price; 4 shrimp seems like skimping on such a massive salad.  The cheesy garlic bread was ok. The bread itself was baked nicely but the cheesy center was under-seasoned and overall it was nothing to write home about; I'd pass.   Overall it's a fun place with a nice vibe, the food we tried was not bad but not amazing either. It's a little pricey which is understandable given the location. I'd probably pass the next time around since there are a lot of other options in Vegas that beckon to a foodie's heart.",

One piece of chicken was good but the other was really dry and I wasn't really a fan of their syrup.  MUST GET (again): S T E A K & E G G S!! Yumm literally a plate a heaven. I like my steak medium rare and FATTY. It was so perfect with a side of over easy egg (my choice), an English muffin, and potatoes.   Our service was a bit slow and she seemed to forget a lot of (small/basic) things here and there. Despite those two things, she still had great customer service and eventually brought everything out so I didn't really mind, could have been busy/short staffed so it's understandable.   #food-industry - I feel it 100%  Coming back for their steak and eggs!",

Honestly this was some of the best panna cotta in Vegas. Am I weird? You bet. But seriously. Do you love panna cotta as a summer dessert when you're in Vegas in July and it's 320 degrees outside?",

The pancakes are really heavy and chewy and fluffy. You get four, which was way too much for me. I only ate 1.   The service wasn't great at first...the first waitress never came back after we told her we needed a minute to decide what to drink. We waited a really long time and had to flag down someone to get a waiter to take our order, which wasn't cool at all. The waitress who served us after that though was phenomenal. Engaging and attentive. They add a sketchy concession fee which I hated, but didn't protest.   My husband had the burger which was huge but delicious.",

    "text": "Recently while in Vegas we had our wedding brunch at HEXX kitchen + bar, and it was awesome! We absolutely loved our experience here!   We had a group of 8, so we made a reservation. We lucked out and got to sit outside, which is what we were hoping for. Their patio is lovely and right on the Vegas strip. If the weather is good I highly recommend you sit outside if available. You have a great view of the Eiffel Tower as you dine.  A few in our group opted for the Bottomless Mimosas, but we chose to share the Magik Dragon cocktail, which is served in a small (but shareable) pitcher and contains Tito's, Bacardi Dragonberry Kinky Pink, passion fruit puree, and blood orange puree. And the presentation is awesome! The server will pour the beverage over dry ice creating a really cool steam (or dragon's breath) for you. Plus, it tastes awesome!   My cousin ordered the Twisted Sticky Bun to start, and it was huge! It's served with toasted pecans and a cream cheese frosting. It was so decadent that she couldn't finish it all, so B and I helped out.   I opted for the Breakfast Croissant, which came with black forest ham and aged cheddar, and I added scrambled eggs. It was served with home fries. Everything was delicious! And the serving was so big! I didn't come close to finishing it.   B opted for the Carrot Cake Pancakes. They were served with cream cheese frosting and maple syrup, and they were so good! I prefer a savory breakfast, but these pancakes were definitely a welcome addition to my meal!   And, the staff caught wind that it was our wedding day, so at the end of the meal they brought us a little ice cream cupcake with a candle in it. They were too sweet!  If you're looking for a brunch spot in Vegas, I would definitely recommend HEXX kitchen + bar, we loved it!",

This was probably the most mimosas I've ever drank, in one sitting, lol.   Located inside the Paris Hotel & Casino, HEXX, is a very hip & trendy spot. Groups of bachelor/bachelorette parties, as well as bdays, etc, celebrating.  Some tables had a giant disco ball drink, called the Cauldron, which looked refreshing and delicious.   We had a reservation, and arrived a few minutes early. We were sat immediately at our reso time. Our group was 8 deep, and were sat in the less noisy, back area, quiet section,which I was totally fine with. The main area was loud, fun and popping.   Everyone was very pleased with the dishes they ordered. My fave was the Hexx Benedict. The portion and flavors were perfect. The ham croissant was a bit much and ham was a little too salty, but potatoes were delish. The chilaquilles were tasty and spicy, kinda like breakfast nachos.  The star on the table was the carrot cake pancakes! They were SO good!!!! Get them, for sure. No need to add any syrup, they're perfect the way they come. The cinnamon roll was delicious as well. Portions for both were perfect for our table of 8 to share. it was way more than enough.  And again, our server Natalie was AWESOME!!! She was super friendly and honest with her thoughts on the dishes, which I appreciate. Also, turns out, she's a Spartan Race Sister! She gave the best tips for my upcoming race. Amazing!",

The 4th time the water pitcher was gone, so I  started to call the restaurant for service when he showed up. He never asked how the food was either, fortunately it was very good. If not, we would have had an issue as he was never around.  Spoke to Denise the manager, she gave me her card. We will go back to see if it's any better, and write and updated review if it is.",

The food took FOREVER to arrive and some of it was nearly cold. The cheese on the carbonara pizza we ordered was already hard. The hostesses/servers were pretty snooty, and I got the sense that they were resting on their laurels of being in a prime location on the strip and didn't care very much to do a good job waiting tables. My party and I kept glancing over at the counters to see what was taking so long and it looked like most of the waitresses were chatting to each other and laughing. I'd understand if the food wasn't yet ready but there wasn't even a single attempt at visiting the tables to see if everything was alright or if we were enjoying ourselves. My glass of water didn't get refilled until the bill came at the end. So if you don't mind slow/careless service and paying the nearly 5% concession fee (basically just for eating on the strip) then I would recommend this place simply because the food is worth trying and the location is choice. Watching the Bellagio fountains from our inside table was pretty sweet, I'll say that much.",

    "text": "We visited Hexx lounge during happy hour.  We were told certain beers, snacks, apps, and pizzas were 1/2 off. Seeing the beer prices, I opted for a beer listed at $8, as did my husband. We ended up ordering a second round, with one $8 beer and I think the other was listed as $10.  The only thing we ate was the cheese & charcuterie, which was good. When it came time to close out, everything was listed as full price, coming to $58.69, when supposedly our beers and the charcuterie plate were \"half off.\" I double checked with the bartender, asking specifically if these were the happy hour prices, and he assured me they were.  So I guess a non-happy hour snack there would be more than $100? I know it's Vegas but that's ridiculous. I would not return.  Long story short:  buyer beware. Confirm prices before ordering.",

To my disappointment the bartender was totally rude. She gave us a menu and completely ignored us after. My husband even said 'excuse me' to her a couple of times when she walked by but she just kept walking. Mind you the restaurant was DEAD  at that time and it was just us 2 and another couple at the bar but the bartender was way too concentrated on helping one couple. We ended up leaving without ordering anything and definitely will not be back here.",

    "text": "We had a pretty horrible experience here. If you find yourself here, do NOT order the chocolate manhattan.   Trying to find a quick bite to eat and escape from the crowds, we approached HEXX from inside of Paris. Looking into the restaurant behind the hostess counter, it appeared dim, quiet, intimate, and a little upscale.   But then we were escorted to our table. A walk down a hallway and around the corner...and arrived at our table which appeared to be in a completely different restaurant. It was bright. LOUD. Packed. We considered leaving immediately but we had been searching for a spot to eat for a while, so we decided to tough it out. Wrong decision.   Here are some silly things that happened:   -- The staff allowed one large table of 20+ people to be disruptive to the entire restaurant, as they did the high-pitched whistle over and over again to get the groups attention, sang Happy Birthday 5+ times, and basically screaming at each other.  -- It took over 20 minutes for anyone to visit us originally. Basically 10-20 minutes between any server visit. The entire meal took 2 hours when it should have taken 45 minutes, if not less. -- For some reason, people from the strip kept (accidentally?) entering through a side door that entered into the restaurant. The signage on the door wasn't really clear and no one from the staff was regularly in that area, so people would open the door and stand there with the door open, or open and close it, etc. It was 40 degrees and windy while we were there. The tables right next to that door were literally completely bundled up with hats, gloves, EVERYTHING. We kept our coats on.  -- One of our food items that was delivered was bad. Really bad. (It was the mac & cheese - how do you screw that up?) It was so bad we each had one tiny bite and didn't touch it again. Server never asked how our food was, and picked up the completely full, nearly untouched dish at the end of the meal without even questioning it.   Nothing on the menu made sense. There is no theme in the cuisine - it's all over the place. One thing we ordered was the sausage pizza. It was the highlight of our meal but consider that every thing else was terrible. Basically, it was slightly above average in ingredients and flavor.   The only -and I mean ONLY - saving grace of the meal. I ordered the chocolate manhattan. Now I will drink pretty much any adult beverage no matter how bad it is. But I couldn't choke this down. The server did notice I had barely touched it after about 30 minutes and offered to swap it to their moscow mule for no charge. For this gesture they earn back a star.   There are so many excellent restaurants nearby -- do not stop here.",

    "text": "Brunching here with Yelp friends is always a good idea.  Thanks to Stefany, we had a group of 6 enjoy a weekend spread of brunch items.    Friends that share - care! This is why I like to dine with this group.  We decided to share several menu items, Carrot Cake Pancakes, Hexx Benedict and Chilaquiles.  The Hexx Benedict was definitely the star of the show.  Instead of being on an english muffin, a layer of scalloped potatoes are nestled beneath the canadian bacon, poached eggs and hollandaise.  Several spears of asparagus top off the lovely dish.    The Carrot Cake was no slouch either.  The spicy batter comes out in full flavor with the dollop of cream cheese frosting. It's generously fill with walnuts to complete the ingredients.  With all of that sweetness you really don't need to add the syrup.    The Chilaquiles lacked comparing to the other two previously mentioned items.  It was good but not great.  This is dish is good for sharing since you can just grab a few chips with toppings.  Our service during this busy time was decent.  The gentleman had a fun and friendly table side manner.  The assistants helping refill drinks were very consistent in checking on our table and keeping us hydrated.  They certainly were attentive and made our visit enjoyable!",

The artichoke hearts gave it some flavor and the cheese was creamy and not overbearing. We also grabbed a twisted sticky bun that was perfectly cooked, the pecans added a welcomed crunch, and the bread was soft and not over baked. I had the corned beef hash for my meal. The eggs were poached perfectly, the corned beef was moist, the sweet potatoes complimented the dish very well, and the hollandaise gave the dish just enough of a splash of extra flavor.",

We sat outside so maybe it was easy to forget about us.. At first I thought maybe it was because management gave her too many tables to wait (inside and out). But when our waitress came outside, she completely forgot every table to the right of the door! She didn't even look our way for me to get her attention. Later when I joked that she missed us, she gave me an attitude!  Meal started out good. Then waiting forever for refills, a little salt, the check, then getting attitude cause the waitress forgot us? No thanks. No wonder they needed Groupon to lure customers in.",

Located off the strip across from the Bellagio fountains, HEXX focuses on fresh, quality, approachable American cuisine with extensive drink options OH, and it's attached to a candy store as well! What's not to like about that?  I loved the atmosphere; modern, cozy, home-y vibe that made you feel like you were in someone's house casually sitting down for a good meal. As we settled in we pursued the brunch menu and I actually had trouble picking what I wanted because everything looked so good to me. After some rounds of coffee I opted for the ham and cheese croissant which our server recommended and I was not displeased in my decision. It was a huge sandwich with aged gooey cheddar, a nice helping of black forest ham, and a nice soft and warm croissant bun served with a side of their home fries. Seemed like the perfect way to start my morning as  I was completely satisfied with what I ate and now was ready to get my day started. And although the candy kitchen seemed very tempting, I had to restrain myself since I was still basking in my brunch pleasure and it seemed too early for that, until next time!  Give this place a shot for great food, views, and atmosphere when you don't want to eat at a buffet.",

Breakfast: I am not a fan of potatoes, but these roasted and pan-seared fingerlings were done well- crisp, buttery, and sprinkled with sea salt. The omelet was good. Want a hearty start? I loved the multigrain porridge, loaded with barley, farro, oats, and a variety of dried fruits and nuts.   Sweets: the candy shop offers free chocolate tastings at the bar that faces the chocolate-making room. You can try 6 darks or 6 milks. Everyone is so friendly and well-trained that I bet they would gladly offer all of the samples. Same with the ice cream! Ahhh, heaven. They use their own chocolate in the different chocolate ice creams offered. Feeling like going all in? Make it an ice cream sandwich, which can be make vegan with the sorbet or gluten-free with the GF chocolate chip cookies.",

If I'm paying for Wagyu steak, don't serve me jerky and expect me to pay for it. The burger came out entirely wrong-as in the wrong burger. My child had to wait an extra 20 minutes for the burger to be remade. By the time the burger came out, half our party had already finished their entrees. As a result, we were late for our next exciting Vegas excursion.",

    "text": "I'm going to give my honest review as a resident of Las Vegas.   I came here with a few coworker's to have our annual Christmas dinner on a Wednesday afternoon. We all live in Las Vegas, so it took us awhile to find parking to the hotel & casino, and then walk to the establishment.   We had reservations and we were quickly seated. We decided to sit inside, although they had heaters on the patios outside. We wanted to be warm.   Service 3/5: I'm honestly not sure what our server said her name was because she spoke so quickly I really couldn't understand her. I did hear her ask what type of water we would prefer to drink, and there were several options; which was a nice touch! Service could have been better. She was friendly, but spoke way too fast.  Food 2/5 I was so disappointed. I ordered the King Salmon, and I'm not sure why I was expecting it to be king sized. I ate it in 4-5 bites. It was a super small portion but the presentation of the salmon was beautiful. I was going to order the chicken and waffles that my coworker ended up changing her order to, but I didn't. It looked way more filling than my salmon, and it also taste so much better than my food. I should have ordered the chicken and waffles.   We also ordered two alcoholic potion beverages. The first one was the Jungle Juice potion. It was very delicious, but of course it had low alcohol percentage. When we neared the bottom of our potion drink, we noticed a hair in our dry ice. We were all disgusted, but we work in the food and beverage industry so we know what it's like to have unruly customers. We told our waitress, and a manager came and quickly resolved the issue. Thank you! We also ordered the berry potion (I forgot the name).   Ambience 5/5 Hexx Kitchen was beautifully decorated and very spacious. The patio was also very beautiful, and every 15 minutes, we were able to watch the Bellagio's water show.   Overall 2/5 Unfortunately, I felt we could have spent less money on the same portion-sized food. It also took forever to find parking, walk through the hotel and casino, and find this place. It was an alright first time experience, but I more than likely won't be returning.",

It took an unreasonable amount of time for the server o even take our drink order much less get our drinks. When we finally for our food. My husbands steak, who he asked for medium rare, came out still bleeding. When we requested another steak, he waitress looked annoyed. When the second steak came out it was well done. At this point we asked for the manager and the waitress rolled her eyes. The manager came out and said she would take it off our bill and get it fixed. About another 20 minutes go by and the waitress comes back and asks if we need anything else, and we said we were still waiting for the meal, and she responded in a snarky way and said, i didnt know you wanted it. Why would she not think we would want the dinner we came in for? At this point we asked for the manager again and had to wait so long that my husband had to go find a different manager. When the original manager came to the table i explained to her what was going on and she too rolled her eyes. She said we never requested a third meal said she took care if our bill and turned and walked away. The male manager was very helpful and offered for us to stay for a drink. I am not one to turn down free alcohol, but we were so turned off we didnt even want to stay. When we returned the following day to speak to the general manager, she was unavailable to talk to us because she was in a meeting.  If i could give zero starts i would. This was the worst restaurant experience ever. I would never suggest going here.",

I ordered the Cinnamon Apple Pancakes and they were absolutely delicious. No need for syrup. Every bite was heaven.   However, my wife ordered the Steak and Eggs and she had to return the steak because it was way too salty/over seasoned. But the eggs, biscuit and potatoes were good.   I would definitely try this place again and I would recommend. The staff was great and the view from the patio seating was nice. They even had heaters outside to ensure their guests were warm to enjoy people watching. Loved it.",

Now because it was so early in the morning, there weren't many people in there. Sat at the bar so I could watch sports highlights. Bartender was friendly and let me look over the menu at my leisure. I ordered the Hot Mess. A mess of fries, pork, eggs, and gravy. It took a long while before my food appeared. Like a really long time. Or it seemed really long. Because I was famished and tired, I ate some but not even half. It was salty. Told the bartender and he offered to get it remade. But I was too tired to care. Paid my bill and went on my way.

If you decide to have a nice dinner this is the place and if you just want a quick drink and/or appetizer before a show then this is the spot as well.",

I took my friends to the brunch and booked a reservation in advanced this was such a great place to go to it's kid friendly it is kind of loud with the music but it's fun the food there is amazing and the service was great I had a group of five and a 10 month old. We sat on the patio and it was so nice out! I wish I got the waiters name because he was awesome, I Very funny and I never had an empty glass of the endless Mamosa's. Food wise the food was very great! I ended up getting carrot cake pancakes and they are tooo diiiie for!! my boyfriend got corn beef hash and that is also amazing! So if you do go to Hexx have fun! :)",

For example $17 for a small dish of calamari or $9 for a piece of cake that wasn't a piece of cake, but two small lines of cake the we're about an inch wide by 3 inchs long.  But by far the thing that really pissed me off was the 4.7% concession fee that was added on to my bill by the restraunt.  When I asked a server about this charge, he told me that it was imposed by the owners to help pay for the cost of owning a restraunt on the strip.",

    "text": "Never in my life did I think that I could go out someplace in Vegas and be so disappointed! We showed up to Hexx around 9AM. It was busy on one side, but totally empty on the other. We assumed the other side was a different restaurant. We said we were okay with any table, inside or outside and the hostess said it would take 15 minutes. 30 minutes later we are still waiting for our table with absolutely no update. We finally go up to the hostess to ask if our table was ready and she asks us if we ever got a text message, which we didn't. The hostess apologized and took us to our table. We sat there for about 15 minutes when a server finally came and took our orders.   We ordered 2 coffees, an egg white omelette, a croissant sandwich, and a yogurt parfait. Our coffees showed up in tiny little cups while everyone else had regular coffee mugs. The server said they were out of big cups and would bring them as soon as they were available. We continued to wait another 30 minutes to get our food! At this point we are hungry and still waiting for bigger coffee cups. I asked the server for bigger cups and he said, \"We don't use those mugs on this side.\" We were the only table with small coffee cups. I decided to give up on that.   I took about two bites of my omelette when I noticed a long brown hair in my food. I wanted to THROW UP!!! At this point I'm hungry, don't have enough coffee, and just pissed off! I called over the waitress and as she was taking the food from me she said, and I quote, \"Eww that f***ing disgusting!\" UMM EXCUSE ME?!?!? This is supposed to be a nice restaurant, not a trash club! Whatever, I order the yogurt parfait because I was disgusted by my food.   I waited over 45 minutes for them to bring me my food. My friends were DONE with their breakfast at this point. During this time our server dropped a glass of champagne on a guest sitting across from us. She dropped two glasses and broke them and acted like it was the customers fault. I got pissed and went to the manager and asked for the checking letting her know I was clearly done with this trash of a restaurant.   When we got the check, to my disappointment, she only took off the charge for the omelet! She didn't comp us our meal after everything we had been through, she charged us for the tiny coffees we ordered after we asked for mugs many times. It was disgusting. We paid and left without leaving a tip.   Honestly, this place is TRASH!! TRASH TRASH TRASH!! With so many nice places in Vegas it is NOT worth even going here. The general restaurant at TI has better service than this junk of a place. I honestly wish I could leave a few bad reviews because people need to know this place is NOT VEGAS QUALITY and they shouldn't waste their time.",

We went in the restaurant from the hotel, but the main entrance is at the other end of the restaurant, facing the Bellagio hotel!   Server wasn't really attentive, probably because he was really busy serving at least 7 tables. Even though the service wasn't great, the food was fabulous.   We had: 1) Pan seared scallops - this was our favorite! 4 huge juicy scallops were served with onion puree.  2) Filet mignon with King Crab Oscar - the beef was tender and juicy 3) Roasted cauliflower - the cauliflower was delicious  4) Mushroom risottos - this is also our favorite! Not too creamy, but yet tasty! 5) Chocolate hazelnut pudding - tiramisu was sold out, so this was the next option. It tastes like Ferrero Rocher with Nutella, this was alright. Not a mind blowing dessert.  If the service improves, we will probably return for the scallops and mushroom risottos.",

In addition, the wait staff was average & in need of improvement in the attentiveness department. They were polite but, seemed \"stressed\" to me. I couldn't figure out why it was so remarkably loud compared to absolutely EVERY restaurant that I've ever been to in my life because it seemed to be a typical Saturday morning really.",

    "text": "This place was EXCELLENT! While I was craving comfort food and went straight for their pepperoni pizza, my dinner mates each ordered steaks. For appetizers, we had the meat and cheese platter and the spinach and artichoke dip (one of my favorite appetizers, so I get it almost everywhere... This place gets first prize. It was incredible). Three of us split two sides, the creamed corn and the mac n cheese, and it was enough for all of us to go with our well-portioned meals.  Their motto is something like \"simple food done right\", and I truly can't agree with that statement more. Everything I tried from here was top notch and hands down one of the best things I'd ever tried, but nothing was over complicated.  For dessert, none of us could decide which one we wanted the most... so we each got two. Overall at our table we had the orange bar, the peanut butter cheesecake, the panna cotta, the s'mores, the champagne shaved ice, and the passion fruit mousse. Each one was delicious in its own way (and the dessert portions were small enough to merit two desserts each). My favorite ended up being the passion fruit mousse.   My only gripe was the server. I'm not sure if this is a restaurant-wide policy or if it was just our server who did this, but any time we would ask about an item on the menu (\"Are the sides large enough to share? How is the Waygu beef aged?\") She would answer our question and then list off her favorites from that section of the menu (even though we never asked for suggestions)... And because we had questions about each major section, I could walk in there right now and order an entire meal for her from start to finish. She was very nice, but that kind of information wasn't asked for, nor was it relevant to anything we did ask.",

We were immediately seated and given dessert menus.  Our server, a young man with light hair (can't remember his name) was phenomenal with recommendations and putting up with all the questions from a group of 8.  Wow do they have a variety of desserts and drinks.  After much contemplation I settled on the chocolate cake and couldn't have been happier.  It was unlike any cake I've ever had.  So light and airy and not in a tall slice form.  This cake looked like spun cotton spread out with cinnamon cream cheese frosting and chocolate ganache on the side.  Sprinkled over the top was toasted almonds.  The carrot cake and banana cream pie also got 2 thumbs up from the group.  Needless to say my carb count was ruined for the week but what a way to fall off the diet wagon!",

Thanks to it's strategic location across from the Bellagio, this restaurant relies solely on heavy tourist traffic, one-time visitors. Hence, it can afford to be below average or just plain bad. Sadly, the food is mediocre and the service is beyond terrible. The manager (white guy with brown hair about 5'11 or so) appeared to have a racist attitude and apparently  treated me, a minority, as a second-class citizen. Our waitress was better, but not notably better (considering her superb treatment of our neighbors. She even offered them free desserts for no apparent reason). Very disappointing and upsetting to say the least. Please do yourself a favor and find a better restaurant on the Strip unless you want to feel less of yourself.",

Anyway we were quickly seated and our waitress Melissa took care of us. She's the best!  From recommending the special cocktails to the best brunch options and sides, she was on par.   I had the brioche french toast with bananas on top, fiance and 2 others had the corned beef hash, a sandwich, an omelet, and one had the gravlax benedict. The corned beef hash is a little on the small side so I suggest you also get the pulled pork fries. Ohhhh yes.  The brioche french toast was a little dry so I drowned my toast with syrup. The corned beef hash was actually really good but I wish there was more of it.   The special dry ice cocktail punch bowl thing was also good. We prefer the jungle juice one. Serves 2 if you really wanna get wasted but can easily be shared with 4. Drinks are actually pretty strong (at least the purple one with absolut acai).   If you come here, gotta ask for Melissa. Kept us entertained and gave really good menu options (the fries were one!!). Definitely will come back when we are in town. Thanks for giving us a good time, Melissa!",

Crab cake: Delicious and they did not skimp out on the crab meat! Every bite was satisfying!  Spinach dip: The dip was LOADED was spinach and artichoke. The cheese pull was mesmerizing !

First time around, came here with girl friends and we ended up waiting close to an hour before we got seated at a table. The food was pretty good and we left satisfied, so I didn't mind the wait and was prepared for it for the next time. Got seated in about 10 mins the second time when it was just my husband and me. Our server was very courteous and guided us through the menu.  We started with the sticky bun and cappuccino and it was the perfect combination, highly recommend both. For the main course, I got the hexx Benedict, the same thing I  had ordered on my previous visit and husband got the chilaquiles. Don't let portion sizes fool you - the potato base in the Benedict is creamy and uber filling. Loved the sauce on the chilaquiles. They also have guava champagne, something I haven't seen in a lot of places.  Hexx is right across from the Bellagio fountains, so get an outdoor table if you can.",

We came around 11 AM, put our names down and within 10 minutes our table was ready. This place has a ridiculous amount of seating so no wonder our waiting time wasn't long! The interior is so nice and to my surprise was connected with the Paris Hotel/Casino. It did take a little bit longer than usual to get our menus and place our orders. Our waiter was serving so many tables that she was crazy busy, but also very friendly! I ordered their carrot cake pancakes and I did not regret that one bit! If you're craving something sweet for brunch, I'd recommend going with this. These aren't average pancakes, these literally taste like carrot cake and their topped off with delicious frosting. They were so filling too I could barely finish half of it without exploding so I'd recommend splitting them with someone.   Food: 10/10  Service: 8/10  Interior/Seating: 10/10",

I should have just ordered a second and counted as my meal.    We had 6 diners; everyone had a pretty average meal.  Average is fine, but so considering the price point and location, it should strive to be better.    Our server was absolutely fantastic.  The people working in front of house were above par for the strip.    My big issue was $10.00 tacked in to the end of the bill.  We asked if it was part of gratuity (it wasn't a full 20% so we were confused).  Apparently the owners charge the patrons this fee for the luxury of \"dining on the strip\".  We asked for this to be removed and left the extra $10 for the fantastic server.    This fee is absolutely ridiculous.   I don't think we will be returning after getting hosed with this sly move.",

My suggestion - the calamari is seasoned well, but the ranch and hot sauce should be on the side and not drizzled on it. If you go, ask for it on the side. The drizzle takes away from the taste of the calamari and is too salty.  I ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes. Amazing! They cooked my steak (medium) to perfection. It was so tasty!  Boyfriend ordered the cinnamon bun waffle... it was a no for me. He also had bacon with his, but some of the pieces were burnt. I wouldn't suggest ordering this. The waffle lacked the YUM factor.   Definitely go if you're visiting. It has a nice ambience and it is clean. Trust my suggestions, though!",

To balance out the taste buds I ordered French toast and my friend ordered a plate of scrambled eggs, potatoes, and steak.  It did the deed, wasn't too crowded for the 10 am hour on a Monday and it didn't hurt the wallet too bad either.   Would have been lovely to sit outside if the weather was warm, but definitely head in and try!",

We sat outside with a nice view of the belagio fountain. They have plenty of shade outside   Food:  Buttermilk pancakes: I asked them to add berries. They were delicious! Nice and fluffy . Full of flavor. It came with four pancakes - which was more than enough to fill me   Fruit plate: pineapple, kiwi, pear, melon, blueberries, raspberries, black grapes, whip cream and banana nut muffin . All the fruits were sweet and delicious   Protein omelette: egg whites and chicken with potatoes and English muffin. Delicious and healthy  Carrot cake pancakes:  fluffy and delicious . 10/10 recommend   Chilaquiles: were the only thing we did not enjoy  Customer service: 10/10. They ordered our drinks as soon as we sat down. At the end, they made sure we enjoyed all our meals. We mentioned we didn't like the chilaquiles - the manager gladly took it off our menu . We weren't expecting that so that was nice of them   Overall, I'd definitely come back here",

Also, due to the timing, we were able to check out their night time tapas menu AND the dinner menu.  Our table tried the awesome burger and it was incredible.  The presentation was beautiful, the taste was awesome, and the portion was very generous.  If you are looking for a good burger, definitely check out this option.  There was also a really nice salad on the menu.  It was coated in cheese (yes!) and included bacon bits along with candied nuts.  For the healthy folks in the group, this is a good option.  Especially if you are grabbing lunch on their outdoor patio, this is perfect since its nice and cool and full of water .  Lastly, grab a seat near a window - free views of the fountain shows at night. YES!",

    "text": "I got a Groupon for Hexx & finally went the night before NYEve which was hectic but I took an Uber so I'm not sure how parking would be in general. The restaurant is inside the Paris hotel-there's a large seating area(s) inside as well as a street patio area. It was way too cold outside to sit outside. My complaint among w two other tables was they kept leaving the glass door open from the patio And it was so cold my food was getting cold. Disappointing but he busboy finally shut it and locked it I thanked him! I ordered the hangar steak ($28) and a side of risotto ($10) I wish the steak was sliced for presentation bc it looked like a brown log..& the risotto was a little chewy and got cold fast bc the door was kept open. The dark red chimichurri sauce was good and I tasted some of my guests horseradish sauce as well. My guest got the ribeye and mashed potatoes ($34) Our waiter was good and friendly but wish they had some bread or something to snack on while we waited. He didn't come by much bc there wasn't anything to do & they had a water guy-talk Asian guy who I told he was awesome as we walked out. He hustled and was great. Overall it was a decent place not sure I'd rush back or go without a Groupon tho. I'm all about paying for top quality but hard to enjoy our meal w/it being so cold the entire time inside -I've never had to wear my jacket the whole meal. The prices are above average but not for the strip restaurants but they also charge You the customer a specific additional tax just be it's on the strip-not sure we should have to be surprised w/that tax. Not big on bill surprises. I really appreciate restaurants that post their prices on the menu via online so people can be prepared. I saw a table of 4 come in & I heard them speaking @ the pieces they got up and left-just post your prices. Cool different bar/private small seating areas to sit in so maybe I'll go back & check that out.",

I like the vibe of the place. It gave me classy but casual. Meaning you could dress up formal or just comfortable. There Mac & cheese was not shareable contrary to what my friends thought lol I refused to shared it.",

We got seated right away at one of the tables that borders the patio, but is still inside technically. We had the best of both!  We ordered the crab cake appetizer, one of their salads, and the vegetable pizza. We had a couple of drinks including the raspberry fizz.  Overall a very nice dining option on the Strip. I would definitely recommend making a reservation. Based upon some other reviews and the photos posted here, next time I will try it for brunch.",

But to spent $66 a head for a cocktail and dinner that we sat for a long time waiting felt like an inconvenience more than an experience. We were seated at 8:30, and still had not received our entrees at an hour mark.  Normal me probably would have complained and been very outspoken to someone at the time, but we were on a ladies night- and didn't want to make a fuss and ruin our vibe or time.",

They accommodated my dietary restrictions and gave me daily and gluten free salad. We sat out front on the patio. A nice view of the strip and everyone stopping to enjoy the misters was a fine time indeed. Service was quite good and atmosphere was spot on cool. The interior of the restaurant was also very nice. Location within the Paris Hotel Casino was perfectly near the lavatories, this was convenient and not a terrible trek through endless mazes within the casino.  Would love to try other meals here besides brunch, but, for now, was quite happy with the breakfast and brunch!  You have until 2pm to order the bottomless mimosas and a two hour limit! Go!",

You can actually sit outside or inside - if you sit inside, they let the fresh air fill the room and it makes such a nice ambience. Now let's talk about the world class service and profesional staff - from the bus boy to the waiter to the hostess on down - wow. I mean. Wow. This was probably the best service we had all week and I am So glad we stopped by. They are very vegetarian friendly too and don't get me started on how delicious their wine selection was. We ordered a bunch of vegetarian goodies from the hexx chopped to the Caesar salads and the vegetarian pizza and white bean hummus. OMG and don't skip out on dessert or you'll regret it. I recommend the red velvet cake !",

And the breakfast was cheap for the portion size and also very tasty. The staff (SHOUT TO SCOTT AND SARAH) were extremely pleasant and accommodating.   For dinner we sat in a private room and it was a super cool swanky upscale vibe. Do yourself a favor and get the spinach artichoke dip. DROOL! Seriously the 4 of us demolished it.   My friend and I both got the noodles with peas in it. I know it sounds weird!! But it was SO GOOD!  And the other 2 got a couple different cuts of steak. Both cuts were delicious. They make an old fashioned CORRECTLY, and the wine was delicious as well. I will definitely go back!!   When we went in the morning I got eggs bacon and something else. I'm going to be honest, I was pretty drunk. But my friend got the pancakes (they're humongous) and all the other dishes were VERY generously portioned. We shared everything and they were all delicious.. The morning staff was super energetic and bubbly which we really needed because we were about to fall asleep at the table and cranky. THANKS GUYS!!  And that's really all I remember lol. Hope that helps.",

There were two seating options, indoor and outdoor; we opted for indoor since the weather was getting warm. Restrooms are located down the hallway separate from the main seating area.   After we placed our order, the food took some time before coming our way. The order consisted of the Brioche French Toast and the Buttermilk Pancakes. I honestly was not expecting 4 fluffy pancakes that were also gigantic. The pancakes and French Toasts were topped with a bit of powdered sugar and equally enjoyable.   Dave was our server and he was a pretty fun guy. He made a few jokes every so often during our time there. Our drinks were also refilled quite often.   Overall, this was a nice place to relax and enjoy breakfast. The decor is nice and the option to sit outside when the weather is a plus.",

We arrived during the brunch hours and was immediately seated and presented with the menu. Wow talk about overload there were so many options that I wanted to try but I settled on the chicken and waffles. Omg what delicious flavor awaited my taste buds. We also ordered the amazing sticky bun, moonshine cocktail and unlimited mimosas. What a treat this place was. I will almost guarantee that there is not a bad option on the menu. Can't wait to return.",

The servers were on TOP of their job when keeping the bottomless mimosas flowing . Never had to wave any one down . I stepped out the box and tried the chilaquiles. Breakfast Nachos. Delicious! The pancakes looked fluffy and huge! The fruit adorning the pancakes was picture worthy and tasty . The burger looked amazing ! Everyone at the table was satisfied with the ambiance and service!",

We requested outdoor seating and the view of the Strip was amazing with the Bellagio fountains front and center.  We got the bottomless mimosas, which they kindly kept refilling throughout our brunch. The food came out quick and fresh. We ordered the steak & eggs which was delicious. The house fries were so good.  All of the staff was kind and very attentive. It was sept 15, so they had a live music for Mexico's Independence Day it was great.   Overall would definitely return to this place, I loved it. I would 100% recommend it.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times for brunch and always have a good experience. I am not a fan of the dinner menu so I always try to go before 4! I went with 2 friends yesterday and we had a waitress come over who seemed agitated before we had even spoke to her. We asked for more time to order and next thing we know we had a different waitress. We thought maybe the other waitress was leaving and just didn't want to take a new table but she was there the entire time that we dined so I guess that was not the case.   However, the new girl they gave us was amazing. I want to say that when I looked at my receipt it said her name was Maria (sorry if I'm wrong). But she was great. We had a lot of questions about the food and the drink menu and she happily answered everything for us.   I got the prime rib dip with the butter lettuce salad instead of fries. We also got the HEXX Cauldron to share. The cauldron was the reason for all of our questions because we wanted to know how much alcohol was in it lol (6 shots of vodka and 1/3 bottle of Prosecco) for those who are curious. The prime rib dip was really good and I like that they gave the horseradish on the side so that I could choose how much I wanted to have on the sandwich. I didn't love the flavor of the Au Jus they have to dip it in. It tasted to much like gravy to me but it wasn't that bad. I really liked the red wine vinaigrette on the salad! Super good. The drink was good and our waitress was very impressed we were able to finish the entire thing because it is their biggest one and comes in a little disco ball which is cool to look at if you spin it in the sun.   Overall it was a good experience as usual after the little switch at the beginning. Will for sure go back.",

    "text": "Our first meal in Vegas for the trip and we decided to indulge ourselves in some cocktails and classy entrees.   HEXX kitchen + bar is located along The Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains and indoor/outdoor seating. Talk about an ideal location! Alexxa's and Hexx share a front entrance. If you plan on dining and having an actual meal, you'd be in Hexx's domain. If you plan on imbibing in cocktails or munching on some tapas, you'd be in Alexxa's. The two places are under the same ownership.  The roasted salmon with black quinoa, peas, and beansprouts and the braised branzino with tomato sauce and pea risotto were absolutely delicious! I'm glad no one was watching me eat, because I could not for the life of me figure out how to eat the beansprouts off the roasted salmon without looking like an animal (chopsticks, please?).  Because we enjoyed the food so much, we came back the next day for brunch. Their Hexx Benedict and Carrot Cake Pancakes were melt-in-the-mouth delicious! The Hexx Benedict over scalloped potatoes was executed well. Perfectly poached eggs over a bed of buttery scalloped potatoes. The Carrot Cake Pancakes tasted as if they had come fresh off the griddle and the cream cheese frosting and syrup made me question whether or not I was eating brunch or dessert for breakfast.   Of course, we paired it with a pitcher of sangria from Alexxa's. If you're not sure which sangria to get (and there are many to choose from), the sangria flight is a great option!  Needless to say, we were very full and satisfied with our meal. Definitely a great restaurant to check out with a nice ambiance right in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.",

Our servers both times were super friendly, attentive but not intrusive.  They both made the dining experience pleasurable.  For dinner we had the shrimp cocktail, filet, Mac and Cheese, and sangria.  The shrimp cocktail was not served like the classic dish.  It was presented on slate with carefully placed complimentary cocktail sauce.  The filet was cooked perfectly.  It had a nicely season crust on the outside which was a wonderful surprise.  The sangria was refreshing.  The Mac and Cheese was good but not great.  For brunch I had the yogurt and granola parfait.  Holy Cow!  It was huge and you did not need the honey that comes with it.  Eating it was pure heaven. They have bottomless mimosas and huge pitchers of Bloody Mary's too! The hash browns were awesome!  They were not shredded but small potatoes that were first seasoned and cooked in the oven, smashed to split them open, and then finished off in the deep fryer!  I've never had hash browns that were so good. Hexx was fabulous!  I highly recommend it.  Double bonus!!!  You have a perfect view of the fountain show at the Bellagio as well.  Enjoy!",

I had the protein omelette and my sister got the corned beef hash, both of which were outstanding! Again, the service was nothing to brag about as once we finished our drinks, they remained empty the entire time, and nobody bothered to check on us until we were totally done eating.

We enjoyed everything we ate: shrimp scampi (which they made into an entree for myself), the wedge salad, veal, spinach and artichoke dip, cheesy garlic bread, pita and hummus, and brussel sprouts. Our waitress was also nice and always made sure we were happy with our experience. Would recommend business casual as I felt a LITTLE out of place with jeans and a t-shirt, but they will still seat you. All-in-all, when we go back to Vegas, we will certainly be eating there again. My only regret, knowing how good their apps, sides, and entrees were, we missed the desert!",

As I was seated on the beautiful terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains and it was about 100F outside (yet definitely cooler on the patio), he and Shannon always made sure I had plenty of water and I was extremely comfortable.   Would definitely recommend the place and Sean is a superstar there.",

We were told there would be a 5 minute wait because they had to clean a table up for us. That being said, I expected there to be a packed restaurant. Hostess #1 asked if we would like to sit at the bar instead because there was no wait there. We replied yes.  As we walked into the main dining floor/bar area, we noticed HEXX was practically empty aside from a few occupied tables and a handful of patrons at the bar. As we sat at the bar, this male bartender told us that this other blonde female bartender would be taking care of us. She came up to us and asked if we wanted any drinks tonight. We replied with \"No, can we start out with two glasses of water?\". She replied yes, and that was the last we saw of her.  Long story short... we never saw those glasses of water. Our bartender never came back to us with those waters even though we saw her standing idly by, 20-25 feet away from us on the other end of the bar. She never returned to take our order even though we had read over the food menu for five-to-seven minutes already. My friend and I cut short our dining experience here and left abruptly because we were put off by the service here at HEXX.",

He was so nice and attentive and overall provided us with great service. I ordered the chicken and waffles- the best chicken/waffle combo I have ever had! Seriously, the chicken was so crispy, juicy, and just plain perfect. The waffle was the right amount of sweet and the bourbon maple syrup was the perfect topping. My bf had the corn beef hash and he also stated that it was very tasty. I will definitely be coming back on my next vegas trip and I hope we get served by Sean again. If you are looking for a great brunch spot on the strip- this is a go to breakfast spot in Vegas!! You will not be disappointed! And I forgot to mention there was practically no wait time (that's a win in my book!! Especially In Vegas) thanks again for your great service Sean!",

Our waiter was friendly and we didn't wait long for food. My problem, and it was a BIG problem, was when the bill came. There was a charge for $8.00 for CNF. I asked the waiter what CNF was. He said it was a concession fee, a charge for the privilege of sitting outside on the patio. WTF?? I immediately told him to take it off. I wasn't going to pay it. Now, it wasn't the $8.00. I had just spent $197.00 on steak, fish and many drinks. It was principle. He immediately removed it. And I thought, \"How many people are paying this extra fee, and how much more money is the restaurant taking in on this scam\"? Be careful. Read your bill.",

We sat at the high tops located right when you enter the dining area.   Not 100% on the name of the pitcher we order for drinks but i believe it was on a special drinks menu and it involved dragonfruit (Kinky something) recommend by our waitress. It was delicious, only down side is it cannot be poured into separate glasses (says the waitress) because the presentation involves dry ice.   For appetizers we ordered, Over cooked bacon, which is exactly what it sounds like haha, Crispy Broccolini, which were great (must try), and the spicy pork rinds which also what it sounds like. Figured there would be something more than just the obvious.   We also ordered Chinese Chicken Salad (yum), Sausage flat bread (meh), and the spicy jambalaya (super spicy but the best entree we ordered out of everything).  Great for a one time meal, most likely won't be returning. Quality of food vs. price isn't worth it. Still a nice place to sit outside and enjoy the Bellagio fountains across the way.",

The mimosas are on point! The Margherita pizza was delicious. The food was incredible, and best of all was the service. Our waitress, Taylor, was attentive, empathetic, and kept the bottomless mimosas coming all morning. She was great at making recommendations and was so sweet. She deserves a raise!! It was the perfect balance of great service and a fun environment. Overall, I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone I know, and I can't wait to return next time I'm in town. Thanks Taylor for a great experience, we will be back!!",

    "text": "Review is for dessert only. We had a good solid French dinner at Mon Ami Gabi next door and wanted to have dessert here because of all of the single origin chocolate hype. We ordered the Ecuadorian Brownie with Coffee ice cream and Chocolate silk pie.   Brownie - texture was crumbly and not the melt-in-your mouth texture we were hoping for. Coffee ice cream texture was fine but it needed more coffee flavor.  Chocolate silk pie - it was a tarte with a thin layer of chocolate mousse in a thick graham cracker crust and a large mound of whipped cream on top. The chocolate mousse lacked strong chocolate flavor and once diluted with the whipped cream, was not strong enough to stand up against the strong graham cracker taste from the thick crust.   Disappointing considering this restaurant was supposed to specialize in chocolate.",

Very friendly and explained the menu adequately. It took a very long time to have our empty dishes removed and get our check, which made the experience more annoying. The food was good, but not what I expected. I ordered the salmon, which was a tad overcooked. It also comes on top of soup (yep, weird) and has a salad on top of that. The salad falls into the soup, which is weird. Not a wise presentation in my book.",

Like, when I go out to places, I don't order the salmon cause I'm a cheapass and I just don't. BUT, I was in Vegas and I thought to myself, ehhh what the heck. So I ordered the salmon, and my friend did too. YUCK! It was beyoooooond salty. I mean, unbearably salty. The only reason we ate it is because we ordered avocado with it, and it drowned out the taste (and because we were so incredibly hungry). My boyfriend ordered the turkey club sandwich, which he said was good. He had no complaints.   All in all, I was angry because I figured \"It's Vegas, their food should be good, right?\". I'm just gonna stick to not splurging anymore, because it's just not worth it. At least at this place.",

The manager said \"the dog has to leave\" even after I brought up the federal laws for service animals. At that point, I got up and walked out of the restaurant. It is so disturbing to me how cruel the manager was. I have never experienced something like this! My dog is so well behaved, quiet, and friendly. AND SHE'S A SERVICE ANIMAL!!!

When she posed the tequila, I wondered how much were they really allowed to give us? She filled up the jigger, then kept pouring over that. That means nothing of course, until you take a sip and taste perfection.  I hate it when all you taste is the slushie.  This was not the case. We took a sip and it wasn't too strong and it wasn't too plain. It was nice to get a real drink made. That's pretty much what you get in Las Vegas.

When I cut into the steak I realized I didn't need a steak knife; a SPOON would do. It was crispy on the outside Med/rare and it was like BUTTER.

Well, I suppose it would be because Mon Ami is often full to the gills, while Hexx was half empty.  Other than that, though...  The menu had a little bit of something for everyone (including a pizza or two, which seemed out of place) but only a little bit.  There were items among the eight listed entrees that sounded good, but Hexx seems to be mostly a steak house.  My wife and I started by sharing the Surf & Turf Sliders - a creative idea which was pretty good, but far from astounding.  We then each had a wedge salad, which tasted like a wedge salad - pretty good.  For the entree I decided to try a steak other than my usual favorites (filet or rib eye), so I went with the hanger steak.  Once again, good but not great.  Perhaps that's just because hanger steak is a cheaper cut.  Or perhaps not.  Anyway, most of the flavor came from the Bearnaise sauce.  A side of creamy mashed potatoes was very good.  My wife thought her Spaghetti Carbonara was excellent but, seriously, isn't that dish sort of excellent by definition (assuming you can afford the calories)?  Our server was pleasant and attentive, but made a significant error in adding up our check.  One last gripe, which is not specific to Hexx.  Both of the big casino chains on the Strip (MGM and Caesar's) seem to insist that their online menus do not include prices.  It's annoying.  So, for reference of Yelpers, the meal described above with two rounds of drinks came in at about $170.",

The pizza was awesome and our \"bake sale\" sundae was a feast for our eyes and stomach. The service left a lot to be desired though as our waitress all but ignored us until it was time to bring the bill. For the price of the meal, service was a disappointment and i would never eat here again. Note: Ask what the significance of the monkey paintings are but do it BEFORE you order. Lol",

I actually didn't like my watermelon sour - way too sour - and was too polite to say anything. The bartender noticed and he took it off the tab, which was very nice. Mr. Harris ended up finishing it along with his Crown on the rocks.   I loved the decor, very edgy and sexy, with the bar off to the side, but still close to the entrance. I'd go back.",

    "text": "Came in this morning without a reservation, not expecting it to be busy. The hostess was very nice, and we were quoted a 25 min. wait time, which wasn't bad for how busy everywhere seemed. We decided to go to the bar to grab mimosas while we waited, but ended up finding seats at the bar to eat. The bartender dropped off menus and then ignored us. We didn't get asked about drinks (or even given a water) for 10 minutes. Waited another 15 min at least to get asked about food. The food did come out quickly, which was a plus because we were hungry. We ordered an eggs Benedict, chicken Caesar salad, and a typical eggs and bacon breakfast plate. The food was for the most part good, except for my Caesar salad, which aside from it having a long hair in it, was dry with not enough dressing. Of course, I couldn't get more dressing for it because the bartender didn't even ask how our food was until we were all done with our meals. Literally didn't speak to us until taking our plates away when she asked, \"was everything okay?\". Don't get me wrong, she was really sweet when she did talk to us, but really poor service on her part. I understand she might've been busy and I don't need small talk, but there are certain things you do no matter what that take one second. A) drop waters off. B) ask how the food is!!! Won't be coming back.",

Appetizer: crispy broccoli This was delicious. Perfectly crispy, sauce was sweet and sour (like a sweet lemon sauce). It was really good! There was too much sauce though and it was sometimes overwhelming.  Main course: pepperoni pizza Really good. The Arrabbiata sauce was amazing and the garlic slices were delicious. Had to ask for more garlic.  Main course: pappardelle with mushrooms Terrible. Pasta was overcooked, not al dente at all. Not enough sauce so all the pasta stuck together in a huge clump and it was dry. The dish has big chunks of mushroom but it tasted bland. Not much of a mushroom flavor at all. Needs some salt. In the end we added some of the garlic from the pizza into the pasta and it was much better. Still not great though. Disappointing especially for the price.",

There a mid price when it comes to eating in vegas but it's tasty.    The 3 stars are due to the horrible service provided by the waiter.   He gave a sense that he didn't really care about taking care of my table.  He only checked in on us ones for drink and the for food.  My brother had asked him for a water and it never came.  20 mins later i asked another server for water and it finally came.   The other waiters where doing a way better job than the one assigned to our table.   I think the restaurant manager should be more involved in the quality of service being provided by the waiters.",

I guess we must have just come at the wrong time. After being seated and very promptly being met by our waitress for our drink order (apple and orange juice), she returned with them, but didn't have enough OJ in the carafe to fill my glass, and said she would return with more after taking our order. After that, we didn't see her again for a while. Our meals were brought by a different person, minus the English muffin we ordered. I ordered a waffle, but was never given any syrup of any sort. The waffle itself was very plain looking, and softer than a waffle of this style should be. We watched countless people (including our waitress who reappeared) walk by helping our surrounding tables, but never once stopping to check on us. We finally had to go get her and request the English muffin, syrup, and orange juice. The wife said her home fries were good, so there was one positive out of this.  One thing to note, the table next to us must have been getting the same service, because they had to stop someone to ask not only where the waitress was, but items they were missing as well.   I recommend finding another breakfast place if you're in the area. You could probably do much better.",

A bit worried it wasn't actually open. Made it the front and saw someone at the bar and asked if it was ok to eat here. She said of course and started chatting with me.   Ordered a latte first. It was alright and wouldn't recommend getting one.   Asked for some suggestions which included the steak and eggs and the ham and cheese croissant. However, I had my eye on the chicken and waffle meal. She said it was great and a big portion.   When it arrived it was the waffle with two strips and two wings fried to a golden brown. Crispy on the outside and nice and hot on the inside. The wings were ok, but not enough meat.   The waffle was good, but wasn't blown away. It could have been a bit crispier.  Came with spicy pickles which were pretty tasty.   Didn't eat it all, but came close.   I thought the service was great as was the chicken. Came at the right time and sat at the right spot to get that personal attention. I'd probably order the same meal again and sit there at the bar. Next time I'll get the Bloody Mary instead of the latte.",

Twice when I was there it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant, once the front door was open and staff was not allowed to close it as per owner/management.

The food was glorious(white chocolate burger bun) and the bartender Craig was a solid professional who truly understands the science of mixology without being a know it all. The \"all you can drink mimosas\" is a miraculous way of being inebriated in Vegas. HEXX's clientele radiates CLASS with the type of gentleman who takes a girl on a date and covers the bill without expecting a blowjob. I would recommend this place to anyone and not just for dinner but for hosting weddings, funerals and even bat mitzvah's.",

I got the sauce on the side since one review said it was too soggy. I actually enjoyed it without the sauce. The tips were crunchy in a strange way. Like each strand had a crunch piece to it. I loved it. My friend had a love/hate relationship with it. On a side note when looking around the restaurant I noticed everyone ate a majority of the food on their plates even the skinny chicks that only eat once a day. They have an outside area and inside area. You have a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Service was slow but overall i enjoyed it and we are coming back for breakfast tomorrow.",

She was incredible!! From excellent food suggestions to making my sister laugh to chasing down my grandfather when he forgot his jacket at the table, she really went above and beyond to make it a great meal.

My salad with supposedly avocado, had maybe the equivalent of a table spoon of avocado and the rest was filled with large pieces of croutons and kale.  My guest had a burger and it was overlooked and dry, even though we asked for rare.  This was actually the first place to offer green tea, but at $6.50 a cup without refill, it makes the $5.54 Starbucks look cheap.  My friend had coffee and never had refills either, and the overall experience was a $65 bill for a salad and a burger. I get it it's Vegas, but come on people, if you want me to pay these prices, you better review what you're offering. A little courtesy and welcoming staff would really be appreciated and would go as long way.",

It is what makes a dining experience truly a great one. She took great care of us and made some amazing recommendations. We definitely want to come back and sit in her section. The meat Omelette and chilaquiles were excellent. Cooked right to perfection and an array of great and tasty ingredients. The Hexx Potion washed it all down with perfection.  When in Vegas you have to come here for a great brunch experience, sit in the outdoor area (if you enjoy people watching) and sit in Tracee's section. You will want to come back again and again!",

Some really awesome servers and 2. The chocolate. The desserts were off the charts. I don't usually have dessert but I'll definitely have it every time we eat here, which will be frequently. If you're coming to visit Vegas, make this a must do. If you live here, go tomorrow. Did I say they have a view of Bellagio's fountains?",

He made sure we were always topped off and he would come and dance with us! I swear his vibes and energy were high and oh so contagious. Super nice guy. The visit started with him making funny jokes (usually at his own expense) and making us feel comfortable. His service was excellent, but his attitude is what made him stand out.

    "text": "Very disappointed. The positives first: attractive trendy looking restaurant. Located at front of Paris casino so you get a nice view of strip if u want it. My protein breakfast was very good (chicken egg whites etc). But everything else was sub par. Took almost 20 min to get 2 sodas n even then I had to tell the manager we were waiting on them. The French dip was overcooked & lacked flavor. For less than their $19 price, my hubby has had way better. The spinach dip tasted so bad he didn't want another bite. Once you're seated and get bumped by other patrons and your server trips over your chair 2-3 times, you realize the layout is way too crowded- like management didn't account for being at full capacity when they placed the chairs.  In fact, my work blazer ended up on the floor twice after the woman seated back-to-back with me stood up and bumped it off my chair as she kept squeezing in & out of her seat (she was a very slim woman btw).  Overall, a pretty poor experience, especially when you consider the price for everything.",

I had read the reviews and was a little cautious due to a suggested inflated prices and unsatisfied reviews. We were very pleased! We arrived close to midnight- promptly greeted and asked inside or outside. We chose inside however the doors/windows were open so we could see and hear the comings and going of the strip. We were seated inside and Philip was our server who was happy even at midnight.  I love pizza -self described pizza snob and hate a bad pizza. We ordered a pepperoni pizza (6 slices) and crispy fries. My hubby and and I shared. Huge pepperoni slices-a great crust- the pizza did not disappoint!  and fries were definitely crispy! Hubby said they were the best fries he's ever had!? The fries were hot and salty-the best kind of fries! We had a great time and would definitely go back! Mind you the candy/ice cream store is not 24 hrs!",

We asked for salt and pepper and it took forever to receive (I don't know why they're not already on all the tables??) and we had to ask our server twice for sugar for our coffee. I really liked the home fries, they were delicious!  I do love the atmosphere here and on Friday afternoon there was a DJ playing music. But, the music is loud inside and you can't hear your server or have a conversation with your spouse. We saw a lot of people texting at the tables and we joked that that's how they were probably communicating with each other because it was so loud. I recommend sitting outside if the DJ is playing music.  BEWARE - This restaurant adds a CNF charge to your bill. Ours was over $3 the second day and we never found out what this fee is for.",

We had Taylor as a waitress and Tristan as a hostess and they were extremely accommodating. Compared to most of the food on the strip this place was really unique. We started with the broccolini because I needed some veggies. The broccoli was just the right consistency and it had an orange vinaigrette which made it all the better. I had the French toast with fresh fruit which was refreshing and well seasoned. My husbands omelet was heaven, he did the meat omelet minus the pork (it would have been too much) it was so good the chicken was a pulled chicken and after eating it we felt like we went to a buffet. The homemade jelly for the English muffin was a great topper and the home made potatoes were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back here!",

She is top works by far!  Her recommendations were perfect!  We started out with \"Smothered Fries\", okay, you can almost make this one a meal by itself - OMG - The Cheese Curds, excuse my drool, all of this cheese with the right amount of pulled pork (LOTS) and this fab gravy toping it all off! In between we had \"Maryland Crab Cakes\", just the right amount of everything in them! By far my FAVORITE of them would be the \"Crispy Broccolini\" OUTSTANDING! The balsamic dressing they are tossed with To Die For!      We had time to enjoy the fountains between our courses, we were sitting on the patio!  We then had a visit from Michael the GM! What a personal touch this made!  The night is Incredible! Our entree's arrived in perfect timing.  We both had steaks tonight, I had the 7oz Filet, OMG, this steak was EXQUISITE, and boy do I LOVE red meat, cooked to perfection this was! My son had the 14oz Rib-Eye which was just as enjoyable as mine! They were served with grilled asparagus, the only way to eat it in my opinion!      Dessert was so fun! We were treated to an ice-cream cone tasting Extravaganza!  We had 8 different flavors, my favorite was the pistachio!  Not to be let down by the Chef, we were toured in the Chocolate Factory, and learned quite a bit about Chocolate, where it is grown, and how they prepare it! We also had the opportunity to try each of the chocolates they offer as well.  How Amazing this night was! They should be a must on any trip to Vegas!",

Right away it is split between the candy/ice cram shoppe and the restaurant. I just ate a good sized lunch so I thought of treating myself to a sweet something. The candy area resembles any other candy place here in Vegas, with a mixture of Mickey Mouse, Hello Kitty and Star Wars items like purses, glasses, cups, wallets, etc. i steer my way to the ice cream bar where they also service roof beer floats, teas and coffees drinks. This is where my disappointment begins... I ordered a scoop of Horchata ice cream in a waffle cone and an ice hibiscus iced tea cooler. First my order was wrong and the gentleman gave me black ice tea from Peet's.  First the ice cream was ok...good but not like \"WOW\" and pricey over $6/scoop with tax. Now to the ice tea...the cashier noticed it was the wrong tea and I was given a simple ice black tea. He asked the other gentleman to re-do the kind of iced tea I wanted and how to do it. So, not only the taste was very bitter unsweetened, but not enough ice for an typical ice tea in 106 degree weather. I had to add 4 packets for Splenda to get thru finishing my drink and trying not to feel I wasted my money...which I eventually felt anyways.  Honestly, the iced passion tea at Starbucks would've been more satisfying than here. I paid for the name really, and probably won't go back. Sorry!",

If you want a sweet dish to start your day, the chocolate pancakes are the way to go. It's made up of four thick chocolatey pancakes that are plenty sweet with a cake-like texture. It's essentially like eating chocolate cake for breakfast, but you'll feel a little less guilty because pancakes are a breakfast food, after all. The carrot cake pancakes were slightly better, in my opinion. Fluffy, well spiced and full of bits of carrots, and much lighter than the chocolate pancakes, they can be very sweet as well if you consume the entire mound of cream cheese frosting on top. The brioche French toast is rather pedestrian compared to the other stuff we got, but well executed. The \"overcooked bacon\" was just that, overcooked to make the 1/2 pound of bacon strips exceptionally crispy, with a maple glaze covering them for a touch of sweetness. I can see this place being popular just for the view, but the food is a good enough reason to pay them a visit.",

This dish was proof that a heaven exists and all the angels must dine here at hexx. My wife had a vegetarian omlet. Delicious if you are a veggie lover. It was loaded with fresh spinach mushrooms tomatoes and more. You can taste the freshness. Having so much disappointment in vegas with mediocre food and high prices, this place was a treat. So we came back for lunch. Since we saw that their portions was plentiful during lunch, we decided to share a chicken and waffle meal. This was nothing short of greatness. The chicken was crunchy and juicy with perfect seasoning. A little bit of spice with tanginess with the maple syrup topping off the sweet. Now that the greedy part is out of the way, lets talk about the service.  Our waiter during the morning was Melissa who was nothing less than phenomenal.  We were surprised to hear that she was only here a week when we requested her manager to compliment her. Yes, she was that good. And coming back for lunch was no difference. Josh gave us the same welcoming, timely service we recieved from Melissa which tells me they do a pretty damn good job in teaining them. Definitely will be back for dinner.",

The margarita pizza was bland and had no sauce on it. The \"crispy\" French fries were thick cut and soggy, not crispy at all. The chip and artichoke dip was decent but so very small for the price. Don't go here, go across the street and go to the Cabo restaurant; it's so much cheaper, tastes better, and bigger portioned.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I've been here before and had a delicious meal, so good I had to come back on this trip. This time I had a horrible experience. I ordered the filet mignon and a tortilla soup. Waited about 10 minutes for the soup, which I didn't mind, but it was the wrong soup! Brought the right one out 5 minutes later. Waited an additional 20 minutes for the main course, they brought us the wrong order. I was starving and craving the food I ordered, but with a fussy baby, I wasn't waiting any longer. That's what happens when the waiter doesn't write anything down.",

    "text": "Best. Meal. In. Vegas.... EVERRRRR!!!!  From the ambiance, to the service, to the food/drinks to the incredibly talented Chef Piekarski... everything was beyond amazing!  I could not ask for a better experience!  I was celebrating my birthday and decided on this restaurant since I knew we could sit on the patio & have a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show as we ate.  I'm so happy we went here.  From the moment my party & I walked into Hexx - we were treated like we were the only ones in the restaurant - who wouldn't luv that kind of service?!?! Our table ordered the Overcooked Bacon & Hummus Bruscetta for aps - both were perfect on the palette!  Not so heavy of an ap that it ruins your appetite for dinner either.  They were spot on for taste & portions! For dinner, we ordered the Rib Eye, Chicken & Waffles, Sea Bass & Chicken Schnitzel entrees.  All 4 dinners were mouthwatering!  The Ribby (my fav cut of steak) - so juicy, perfect char, and cooked to my exact liking - medium.  It came with this dollop of garlic butter on the rib eye - that took the already delicious steak to a whole new level of deliciousness!  The Chicken & Waffles - Even better than we anticipated.  The chicken wasn't at all dry & had a perfect crunch to it.  The waffles - not your ordinary waffles.  What a wonderful suprise of flavor!  I could eat those all day!  The Roasted Sea Bass was absolute perfection!  Respectively seasoned, juicy & had a little crunch to it cause of the perfectly cooked skin.  That too, had a flavorful char on it (I do luv me some char - lol).  But the best dish of the night was the Chicken Schnitzel.  OMG!!!   As my sis would say \"Their Schnitzel is the Shitzel\".  We really didn't know what to expect from this dish but from the moment I tasted it... there was a very savory party going on in my mouth!  My taste buds were definitely doing the happy dance! We were so impressed by the food that we just had to thank the Chef in person.  I asked our fabulous server, Vanessa, if we could speak to the Chef & without missing a beat, she told us she'd go get him.  A few mins later, the accomplished Chef Piekarski came out and chatted with us for appx 10mins.  He gave us a little Hexx history & a little backstory about himself.  Super friendly & super gracious!!  He never once made us feel rushed to speak to him & he happily posed for pictures with us.  Meeting him and being able to show our gratitude was the cherry on top of everything.... Or so I thought.  Next thing we know, we're getting served a heavenly array of desserts sent from the Chef himself!  The Creme Brulee... absolutely divine! I was in Vegas for 5 days, did all sorts of fun things, ate all kinds of different foods & saw a concert.  Hands down, the highlight of my entire trip was my experience at Hexx.  I can't thank Vanessa & Chef Piekarski enough for making my bday dinner such a memorable evening! We're heading back to Vegas next wkend - I already know we'll be stopping here to try out their breakfast.  Chilaquiles or Carnitas Hash.... Here I come!!!",

So we parked at The Bellagio and walked around waiting to see the fountain show, but ended up waiting 2 hours due to the high winds. Right across the street is Hexx. A reasonably priced venue for food that makes you feel fancy even when you're on a budget (compared to other places on the strip). My wife and I shared a margarita pizza which tasted fine, nothing special, and the hummus and pita which isn't your typical hummus. The garbonzo beans were whole and had a lemon tahini paste that kept it together. The server we had was super friendly and the view wasn't too bad. We sat right next to the window looking towards the fountain. There wasn't any wait and we were seated right away. Overall we spent about $35 for an iced tea and the food.",

    "text": "Hexx, I think they put a spell on us!  What a wonderful space! Cozy little nooks puffed with pillows for lounging, a warm bar to lure you in, a grand modern dining room.  For dining  al fresco, there is an inviting patio, great for people watching with a dazzling view of the Bellagio fountains...not to mention an innovative chocolate shop whipping up fine chocolates right before your eyes. On that sweet note, I visited the candy shop where I bought a huge bag of candy. By the way, upstairs on the roof there is an outdoor beer garden.  Sorry to say I ran out of time as this space has so much to offer...next time for sure!       On to the hospitality and the food.  We were greeted kindly and warmly by Parish, what doll! Kevin was our Server.  He was very professional and approachable, knowledgable and fun! I felt like I was receiving fining dining service without the fussy white tablecloths.  His wine pairing were thoughtful and on point as well as, his food recommendations were stelar! Kevin mentioned that they have a new Executive Chef, Gregg Fortunato.  We enjoyed each dish so very much.  Charcuterie board paired with a warm pretzel and blueberry jam, Fresh heirloom tomato and burrata salad, rainbow beat and farro salad, plump shrimp cocktails and then the Chilean Sea bass cooked to perfection! Everything was so well balanced in color, flavor, and texture! All was plated in the way of art...Edible Art! I loved it. We were so very pleased and satisfied even the manager, think his name was Chris or Christian stopped by to see if we were enjoying ourselves.  Nice touch!   A wonderful experience! Looking forward to our return!",

The first visit, my husband and I sat at the bar. Allison, the bartender was great! The second day, we had a bigger group of people so we sat at a table in the main dining area. The omelettes are delicious with huge portions of home fries. The frittata was also delicious but it was a small portion compared to the omelettes. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

All the meals were maybe slightly above average, other than the waffles, the waffles were definitely above average! The brunch in general was definitely not worth the price, but it's on the pricier side because of the location of course.  The service was very okay.

Prices are reasonable- bottomless mimosas for $23 and most food in the $15-$25 range. Food portions are MASSIVE- worth splitting with a friend. This is a perfect place for people watching and filling up your stomachs before a long day of Vegas!",

We ordered salads and it took about 25 minutes to get our salads. When we got our salads they forgot to give us silverware. We waited for silverware and finally were able to eat our salads.  I would not eat here again because the lack of care for thier customers. Also, it was not a busy day so there should be no reason for horrible customer service.",

The bartender asks I'm sure that I want it because of the size. I said \"yes, I've seen it on your Instagram page.\" However, he did NOT tell me that they were out of crab legs. I noticed it was missing, so I inquired. He told me \"we're out of crab legs, so I added two extra shrimp.\" That would have been nice to know before ordering a $36 drink. Or perhaps reducing the price since the crab is what makes it expensive. Wouldn't go back. Extremely disappointed. Should have gone to TOD's instead.",

They are part of Caesar's and if you are Platinum or above you can get priority seating. The place was pretty crowded and we sat inside but close to the windows. My wife ordered the corn beef hash which was scratch made but didn't really taste that great. We always like trying everyone's corn beef hash but this one was just ok. I had the French toast with fruit. It looked great but the taste was just like that of Ihop. Oh well we probably won't come here again . Since there are so many choices for breakfast in Vegas we will be going some where else. The food wasn't anything to write home about. Don't get me wrong it was ok but we are foodies and want somewhere that is yummy.",

No seriously, you dont believe me try it for yourself! Also if you're in the mood for drinking more then the dried ice drinks are an experience I haven't had anywhere else. They prepare the drinks in front of you and because they put dried ice int he drinks, when they pour water over the drink there's so much fog that comes out.   It's conveniently located in the middle of the strip right in front of the bellagio fountains so you can sit outside, sip on your drink and watch the fountain show.",

They have at least eight different kinds. I had the Salmon for dinner, it was delicious but the falafel was just alright.  Music is very loud, if you choose to sit inside, I think a lot of people complain about that, it really didn't bother me much but if want to have a conversation, it could be intrusive and definitely hard to hear. Solution is to sit outside. Band started around 9 pm and they were good, can't remember their name. Dessert was the most notable part of the evening at Hexx, chocolate cream brulee.",

For dinner he had the braised short rib entree and I had the gnocchi pomodoro. Both, cooked to perfection! Mine was bursting with flavors and his rib was falling off the bone, I had a bite and it melted like butter, delicious! He liked the brussel sprouts, but commented the mashed potatoes didn't wow him. We both had drinks, I went with The Hexx, a little  chocolate number that's delightful! Was told it's been changed a few times over the years before they feel they perfected it, well, I was very pleased with it. Only snapped one photo as we like to enjoy each others company versus staring at the phone, so just a drink shot..no meal ones. Trust me, you cannot go wrong in stopping here.  Our waiter was amazing, the server, crumber and busboy were very friendly and attentive. Very friendly staff, would highly recommend it! Plus is you can view the Bellagio fountains that go off every 30 minutes. Enjoyed our visit!",

The flatbread Had smoked provolone and arugula. I also go the Modern Sangria. Everything was so good my son took the first bit and he just grind and you can tell he was in another place. I let him taste my flatbread and he took a whole slice. It's great size to share. Both were full of flavor. The flatbread was crunchy and that prosciutto and the smoke cheese was perfect together to balance the fat in the prosciutto. Sangria was citrusy and wonderful. I would go again for breakfast.",

This is the first place that I've ever visited where the bottomless mimosa never actually reached the bottom.   It was amazing.

We didn't wait long for the food and were placed in an ideal location to watch the Bellagio fountain show a few times. They have patio seating which positions you perfectly. The meal was costly but a fair price in proportion to a fantastic dining experience.",

That 4% CNF Charge (Concession and Franchise Charge) that a lot of people probably never notice because most of your customers are tourists.  You are out of line for charging this additional fee.  I've eaten at many restaurants on the strip and not one of them has charged this additional fee.  You are ripping people off and I will never eat there again.  If you need to make more money then raise your already high prices on your menu.  The only reason why I didn't complain to the manager is because I had my mother with me and it was mothers day. She was enjoying herself and I didn't want to ruin it for her.",

We were seated inside but still had a view of the fountains. The server was great, I wish i could remember her name she had glasses and was a brunette. She smiled the entire time and made sure we had what we needed. Now to the food and drink. I tried the prime wagyu burger, over roasted chicken and pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and flavorful. My favorite part was the Elixir potion drink I had! My only complaint is that it was a bit sweet. Overall the experience at HEXX was great. I will definitely be returning in the future. I really want to try the brunch here.",

It was a nice night and the restaurant sits right across from Bellagio so you're able to watch the water show every few minutes if you'd like. I love to people watch as well so it was nice for my hubby and I. Our waiter was a little inattentive. However, it was the end of the night so maybe he was just a little tired. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara that consisted of pepper smoked bacon, smoked fontina bechamel and a fried egg. I was pleased. Believe it or not, that bacon adds a different level of savory to the dish. Although I enjoyed it, I feel it was a bit overpriced but hey, it's Vegas. Hubby ordered the braised short ribs with horseradish, mash potato brussels sprouts and gremolata. Now THAT dish did it for me. The short ribs were sooooo tender and juicy...seasoned to perfection. I'd guess the chef who cooked them is somewhere from the south LOL. I almost felt like I was back at home! All and all nice experience.",

The brunch looked good though, so we thought we would give it a try.   The place was crazy packed. We were super happy we made a reservation, but still had to wait a bit to be seated. The restaurant was really loud from the DJ music. We were sitting pretty far, and could still barely hear each other. Not a bad thing at a bar, but not my favourite for brunch when I want to talk.   The bottomless mimosas were a good deal. They bring around a pitcher to fill up your glass, and we had about 4 by the time we left. The prosecco was a bit flat and the OJ was cheap, but I expected that. The food was pretty awesome too. I had the chicken and waffles, served with house made pickles and syrup. So yum. The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The waffle was a bit dry, but the syrup helped. I liked the touch of the pickles, which cuts the heavy meal. I really enjoyed it. My brother had a chicken Sandwich and he really enjoyed his meal too.   I would give the place 4 stars, but something just felt off about the atmosphere. Could have been the loud music and cold server, but I can't quite put my finger on it.",

They have people constantly walking around ensuring your mimosa is full!  This is always nice if you are paying the extra price.  The food was also very good.

Quickly was met by our server assistant to get introductions and waters. Server arrived a few minutes later to gather drink orders.  Ordered a twisted sticky bun for the table and meat omelet as my dish.  Bun arrived soon after and was piping hot! A twited cinnamon bun rolled into a circle and baked. Then, topped with brown sugar, cream cheese frosting and toasted pecans. The warm frosting oozed over crevices and intothe bun as we cut into the dish. Highly recommended for those with a sweet tooth.   Dishes arrived soon after. Meat omelet was bountiful. Musthave included 3 eggs, stuffed with bacon, chicken, pork and sausage, with cheddar cheese. Dish is served with an English muffin and home fries. Home fries are smashed and seasoned new potatoes flash fried. A hearty addition to the dish.  Servers were friendly and attentive to our needs.   Would definitely return to explore this brunch menu again.",

A great view to watch the fountain show sitting inside or out on the patio. It was a little loud inside.  Self parking is available in the hotel parking garage or main valet in front of the hotel.  They are open 24 hours! The menu offerred a lot of variety. The menu focuses on dishes made from fresh, quality-sourced ingredients.   It was a Tuesday night at 10pm and the place is still packed, that's a good sign.  Drinks are pricey, ranges $15- $36. The food came out quick. The sliders and cocktails were tasty!  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, even with it being a busy night.   Make sure you go next door for the chocolate.",

Who eats brunch til 4?  Anyways. We came in wanting something savory and healthy - unfortunately our options were heapingly sweet and big/unhealthy options around lunch time. Boo. So we left and chose another restaurant.   That same weekend, we came in around 2am.. they have a VERY limited menu late at night. Which is ok. But how UNFRESH the seafood were.  We had the lobster sandwich (think of a lobster in between two biscotti's for size comparison) and a flat and left out Caesar salad with no dressing.  We ALWAYS get their cocktail shrimps because they're amazing - but in his case they tasted like old fish and was warm...   And we had the hummus, stale \"pita bread\".   I'll also add we were intoxicated by quickly sobered up after tasting how awful the quality of their food had changed Just because it was late night. It really made us think was our $100 bill worth it for these 3 items? Probably not. Really disappointed because we've had much better but just during a different time - but quality shouldn't change just because high traffic times do.",

I didn't think the happy hour menu was that great because even during happy hour the prices were still a little on the steeper side, even for Vegas. They have a seating section just for happy hour so make sure you ask where to sit and the employees will direct you.   We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and the carbonara pizza. The spinach artichoke dip came with bagel chips which I've never seen before. The dip was delicious but I'm not sure how I felt about the bagel chips. I think I would've preferred just regular tortilla chips instead, but the best thing was by far the dip. Just be careful as it's really hot when it comes out! The carbonara pizza was good as well. I liked the bacon on top and the crust was nice and light. It was a good happy hour shareable.   For four people, these two dishes filled us up (granted we weren't that hungry) and it was a nice place to have a drink and chat.",

It's hard to explain it but the poached eggs were beyond perfection and topped with the most heavenly hollandaise sauce! The flavors of everything in this dish are perfectly balanced and the flavors explode in your mouth since they left some of their spices whole like peppercorns. It's the most beautiful corned beef hash I've ever had. Hexx is a very friendly and inviting restaurant! I really think rachel went above and beyond to make our experience special!

Our bartender was very nice and as on top of it as she could be but she is not an octopus and had like 90 tables sit at once . Food was regular. Not bad, nothing to write home about.

I loved their spicy Bloody Mary vodka, and their Pinky Swear sangria pitcher was SUPER good, like too good....like i want to keep drinking it and you can easily get drunk-off-of-Grenache good. We decided to share the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and the Carbonara pizza, both of which were very yummy choices. The service was on point, and they even gave me a free chocolate ice cream cupcake for my birthday hehe. What really gives this place the five stars it deserves is the spectacular view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain water show going off every 30 minutes. The decor is very classy and cute with the football game playing on every corner (football Sunday!!!). Love, love, loved it! I will definitely be back in the future to enjoy some bottomless mimosas in the heart of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch as a party of 5 on a Tuesday. Not busy at all! We walked in from the sidewalk on the Strip. You can enter from inside Paris Hotel too. We checked in and was seated within 5 minutes. I guess we had to wait because we requested foe patio seating and they had to set up our table. Once we were seated, a bus boy asked us what we would like drink. Our waitress came a few minutes after to get our order but we needed additional time since I came with my family (don't speak much or read English). We all shared and decided to order:   Hexx Eggs Benedict (5/5) - I really enjoyed this because it came with scalloped potatoes instead of an English Muffin. I usually don't like English muffins so it was a win for me!  Carrot Cake Pancakes (3/5) - These were just okay. It was pretty much what I expected. Maybe even a little healthy sneaking in some carrots to the pancakes. LOL. Sausage & Egg Breakfast Pizza (2/5) - I couldn't really taste the egg. The pizza was a little salty. It was just alright. This also gets cold really easily so if you eat it ASAP then maybe it would be better.  Crab Cake (4/5) - I don't usually like this but I thought this was executed well. Lots of crab meat and the aioli sauce went well with it. Not too heavy if you share it with someone.  Veggie Omelet (1/5) - plain 'ol omelet, so if you're into an overpriced omelet, enjoy. Not much flavors, even I can make a better omelet.   As I was ordering though, the waitress kept asking me if I wanted to add stuff to my order. Little did I know, each item I added would be an additional charge. Example, she asked me if I wanted avocado to my omelet or if I wanted an english muffin with my benedict. Anything added was an additional charge so be careful!   This place was ok. Not much to rave about for brunch. The service was actually kind of slow too. The waitress took a good 15 minutes before she got my aunt's coffee.",

We had planned to eat breakfast at The Henry in our hotel but were so disappointed to see it closed for a facelift. That's when I remembered Hexx and how badly I'd wanted to try it.  I was worried we wouldn't get in without a reservation on a Saturday morning but we only had to wait 10 minutes to be seated (it would've been more if we had wanted to sit outside). The Yelp pictures of the food here kill me; my god everything looks amazing. I ordered the Chiliquales and my husband got the Farm fresh eggs which is basically an all american breakfast with the works. Everything tasted as good as it looked and we saw at least five other things we would've liked to try on the menu for next time. But the kicker was the Flamingo Punch we ordered to share. I had heard of the famous Hexx potion drinks but I had never seen the one we ordered. Our waitor was stopped a few times as he brought the rose gold disco ball filled with our cocktail to our table. We got a lot of questions about what it was from passerby and nearby tables as well, but who can blame them? We had a giant, shiny disco punchbowl at our table! The drink was amazing and definitely something to share. We got ~8 glasses each for my husband and I out of that order (don't quote us on the number since we got too boozy and stopped counting after round 4). Come here for a one of a kind Vegas dining experience that's for sure. We will be back guarenteed!",

The restaurant is modern, trendy, and decorated in light colors with green and brown accents. Very \"California\" beach vibe. There are both patio and indoor seating so you can overlook the Bellagio Fountains. There are misters all around the patio to keep you cool as well.   The menu has a nice selection of American food. For our appetizer we had the calamari in buffalo sauce and ranch, a twist on the typical calamari dish. We also had a large crab cake with chili aioli. For our entrees I had the filet with mashed potatoes and my grandma had the veal with mushroom risotto. Both were fantastic. The portions are very large here as well.   The absolute best part of my night was the dessert!! I cannot rave enough about the hazelnut chocolate pudding. OMG SO GOOD.

The berry compote is the best thing ever, I think about it every single day. If you're visiting Hexx for the first time, order the CHEESE!!! Excited to go back and try more off the menu!",

I'm not one for getting brunch drinks before noon, but she mentioned that they can make their Bloody Mary with a spicy vodka and I was SOLD. It was actually my first Bloody Mary and it was spectacular.   The restaurant itself is lovely- and even though it was full in there, you could still hear your tablemates just fine. I got the Belgian waffle with fruit (Lovely) and my boyfriend got the eggs benedict, which is served on scalloped potatoes instead of an english muffin. I would have stolen his food, but I was too stuffed after devouring my own.   We will absolutely be back the next time we're in Vegas, and I'm definitely asking for Taylor again!

    "text": "NOT COOL - I had a huge allergic reaction from the Roasted Branzino, that did not state it had any PEANUTS in it, the manager (whom I will leave nameless) defended his staff and only gave me a meaningless, pathetic \"sorry\".  Hexx is a very modern restaurant in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, where there's a field of vision outward to the Dancing Fountains at the Bellagio.  THE STAFF -  The menus are quite small and very disposable, so I could see why they would not label their dishes' ingredients.  But who's fault is that to go the cheap route? I insisted the Manager (whom I will leave nameless) to start labeling all ingredients on his menu; but, for him it was not the case, he promised that there were no peanuts, then minutes later he consulted me saying there are only pistachios.  What a liar.  Vanessa, our waitress, was very attentive, sweet, and looked like she actually cared when she saw me choking up and breathing heavily after eating my branzino THAT HAD PEANUTS IN IT - she took off the price to my fish and tomato bisque which was so generous her, but she deserved a bigger tip, so we decided to give her an 80% tip.  THE FOOD -   Roasted tomato bisque was utter perfection!!! Seriously the best, it gave me a hedonistic sensation of nostalgic feelings.  I loved the consistency of the tomato bisque, and the creativity of the dish.  The Crab Cake was another appetizer we ordered, which had a subtle citrus savor to it but did not overpower the dish itself which takes a lot of work. The garnish on the other hand was a bit over seasoned which is an honest mistake for a 3.5 star restaurant.  The Roasted Branzino, oh lord, what can I say that I haven't already? Well the fish was glistening, cooked to perfection, but once I took a bite of the diced peanuts that were sprinkled on top, it was game over.  I had to take my dish back after choking and heaving, and watch my date enjoy his lovely looking ribeye the rest of the meal.  Total public humiliation and a shame.   The Ribeye was ordered by my date, whom I was envious the entire time; watching each delectable piece evaporate from his plate to his mouth and the aromas of perfectly seasoned meat infiltrate my nostrils.  It's a bit rude to ask for a taste, but I did - and I was not embarrassed at all! A girl's Gotta eat, i finished 2/3rd's of his rib eye in moments.  I really wanted to love this place, my tomato bisque was astounding, but I can't accept pitiful behavior from a manager who denies accusations when it comes to him, then apologize for his so called \"miscommunication\". My review might not matter in this vast internet world, but I do hope I might save a life or two.",

I ordered a simple eggs over easy, with the usual english muffin etc along with a very well made Irish Coffee.  It was vacation afterall!  My friend ordered the croissant ham and cheese sandwich which she added eggs to (recommendation of the bartender).    Croissant was well made,  crispy outside and perfect inside, along with a large portion of ham, cheese, avocado and perfect eggs.  Portions in both case were fairly large.

You can tell right away that the restaurant has a classy/sort of upscale ambiance, but without the pricetag of other high end restaurants in Vegas.  We got the mushroom pizza to share which was a tad bit salty but still very tasty. The mac and cheese was amazing! Perfect warm cheesy goodness topped with a slightly crusty layer. We also got the purple haze cocktail which is huge so be prepared to share that with a few other people. They add the dry ice at the table which is pretty cool to watch. Our waitress was extremely attentive and very quick. She refilled our waters multiple times during the evening and was very efficient getting our orders and bringing them out.

The restaurant is extremely clean and price aware for being in vegas. I appreciate the value of training they have done on all employees and they accommodated by a free appetizer. Great work Hexx!",

He checked on us frequently but not overwhelmingly. A++ for Tomas!   Josh, our server, came to take our order and was very helpful! He was also very friendly and quick with everything we needed. Another 110%!  I ordered a ham and cheese croissant sandwich (which Josh recommended to add an egg; do it!) And it was huge with some delicious potatoes! Omg, so yummy!  The manager later came to check on us which was really nice as well.  Great food. Wonderful service - thank you Josh and Tomas!",

Made an easy reservation on their website.  We were immediately seated on the patio along the strip as we requested.  The table offered stunning views of the strip looking directly at the Bellagio fountains as the canons went off every 15 minutes.  Tom was our server who was phenomenal. He was positive, quick, and knowledgeable of the menu.  We enjoyed a bottle of cab reasonably priced at $60, the meatballs ($15), the margarita pizza ($16), and the flourless brownie ($10).  Everything tasted great.  The pizza was a little cold but did have a lot of flavor and the brownie was very VERY rich, you'll only want a couple of bites.  All in all a great experience.  Will definitely be back.  P.S.  We entered in from the casino where there was no hostess at the stand so we had to walk through the restaurant to the other entrance just off the strip.",

I ordered the \"spicy jambalaya.\" I tried jambalaya in Louisiana and really liked it so I thought it would be a safe choice. The spicy jambalaya at Hexx kitchen was easily 4x saltier than what I had at other authentic restaurants. I thought there was some kind of mistake and the chef accidentally poured a lot of pepper and salt onto the dish. The waiter was nice and tried to bring us extra rice, but the rice unfortunately was also almost just as salty.   This is the first time I have ever complained about a dish because I just could not stomach it down. I drank 4 cups of water and still was not able to finish the meal.   If you do decide Hexx Kitchen, I would stay away from Spicy Jambalaya unless you like super salty food.",

I told the waiter that \" this is not my food and please check again with our server. Our server- Megan came over and talked to me like \"I heard you guys didn't want your food\". How rude is that?!? I told her that we ordered a steak instead and reminded her to double check her notes. She looked at her notes, felt embarrassed and said \"okay, I will put in your order\" with a bad attitude. She didn't even apologize for her mistakes!!! So unprofessional! Then, our steak came out and looked like a piece of coal. My mom and I could taste the carbon dioxide on the outside of the steak! I called Megan again to return my food and she gave me impolite and incooperate attitude. 20 mins later, the manage came over and gave us the bill. She said \"we took out the steak\" and here is the bill. I asked her to explain, she said \"we don't want to make your order the third time\". The manager was also unprofessional. I showed the picture of the steak and her face was just stern, no reply, no apology. My mom was ruined, everyone got pissed off at this unprofessional services and over-priced food.

    "text": "This place was good but overall a little over priced IMO.  Stopped here for our first breakfast of our trip in Vegas. I ordered the bottomless mimosas ($24), and split a turkey club with my mom. My stepdad and husband split the Johnny Cakes.  --Turkey Club- this has turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and was on a cranberry challah bread. Overall a great sandwich but not the best I have ever had. I think the bread was the best part. The turkey was low quality you could tell but I still liked it. It also came with fries that were pretty good.  --Johnny Cakes - I tried these and they were pretty good, a little doughy for my liking, but my stepdad said that is how they are supposed to be so maybe I am just not a Johnny Cake fan lol. They reminded me of pancakes made out of cornbread.  --Mimosas - Although they were really good, $24 is the most I have ever paid for bottomless haha. But then again, we WERE in Vegas.  Pretty good restaurant but I think Mon Ami Gabi is better.",

    "text": "Yup, these desserts were the first things we ate at 11:30 am in the morning. I don't have a sweet tooth so I tend to shy away from eating sweet desserts, but I caved in and came here.   I had the Budino which was a massive oval shaped dessert. The chocolate was light and the sweetness was just right. There was also a banana flavored undertone to the chocolate boudino, which was interesting. I appreciated that their chocolate is made from real cacao beans. I also enjoyed the crunchy walnuts topped with caramel.   The single scoop of banana ice cream was a reprieve from all the chocolate. Without the ice cream cutting through the richness, I would not have been able to finish most of the dessert. If you are not a serious chocolate lover, do not get this. I do not really like chocolate all that much. So after the first few spoonfuls, it stopped tasting wonderful. As I continued to eat, it started to become very heavy in my stomach.  I sampled my friends' French Silk pie and Brown Cow. The pie was topped with massive amounts of whipped cream and was indeed silky. The chocolate was fluffy and sweet. The Brown Cow, which sounds complex, in the end was just a simple chocolate milkshake with root beer.  Our server was great. She offered to have all of our cards individually processed. The atmosphere was sunny and relaxing. I would come again to try some of their other desserts.",

    "text": "Cute brunch spot, but quite underwhelming. The food certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The benedict was a very small portion, and my friend who had it finished his food well before the rest of us, leaving him dissatisfied. What stuck out at HEXX, though, was the service. Our waiter, Sean, who asked us to mention him specifically if we left a review, constantly tried to upsell everything we ordered, persistently trying to persuade us to order more when we'd already declined. He failed to tell us that upgrading the potatoes with \"onions, mushrooms, or peppers\" would cost an additional $2 PER topping. So the $6 upcharge on our bill came as a surprise. Sean also kept referring to Patrick, the person refilling our waters, as his \"assistant,\" which seemed pretty demeaning and self-important, even if it was True. Amidst his constant upselling, Sean also made strange comments that came across as faux-charisma: for instance, we asked for salt and pepper, to which Sean replied \"upon request\"... The atmosphere and decor of the place is cute and \"aesthetic-y,\" which I'm normally a big sucker for, but in this case it felt like a pretty face with a bland personality. The seats were uncomfortable to boot. Overall, it was a fine brunch, but ultimately we wouldn't go back.",

By the time we reached dinner, we were a bit too happy aka tipsy. My friends were being completely annoying with repeatedly asking the server to turn on and off the outside heater. They were also being loud however the service never seemed to change. We received fantastic and friendly service the entire time! We primarily stopped by for drinks because last time we hit Vegas, we remember the wonderful drinks at Sugarfactory which is now HEXX. The drinks continue to be amazing of course.   Now, I'm not kidding when I say that HEXX has the BEST broccollini EVER. Please consider in trying! It's soooooo good.   Towards the end, we were even more annoying by asking to split the bill between a lot of us. There was a bit of confusion from my friends regarding the final amount that at one point they thought we were being overcharged. But at the end of it, we were wrong and I am deeply sorry for the trouble we may have caused and so I hope that sharing my wonderful experience with the fantastic service makes up for our tipsy actions. I appreciate the friendliness by the staff during our entire visit !",

I got the veggie omelette which was one of the best omelettes I've had.   There is no time limit for sitting and enjoying your mimosas so we sat for some time after we finished our meal and enjoyed our $25 bottomless drinks.

Very nice and yes it was a busy night with a convention in town. We got our table at 8:50pm placed our order at 9:10pm by that time it started dying down a bit. Well at 10:05 my husband and me just look at each other and wonder why the table next to us which is a party of four and get seated 20 min after get their meal. Our waiter, Lupe finally comes and states \"let me check if your food is ready\" it's 10:15 ish by this time my husband is frustrated, hungry and really disappointed. She came back and said it's going to take another 5 min. At this point after waiting this long, being ignored and had a long day at work and us simply just wanting a decent meal since it was my birthday failed.It really sucks to have your hopes up on a restaurant and have my birthday dinner ruined because the waiter forgot about our table. Extremely disappointed, we left.",

It's was not your average cheese bread you would expect. It was cut in mini squares and had a little cheese in the center of the tray. Definitely wasn't cheesy enough for me. My wife made reservations in hopes in getting our table immediately upon arrival, keep in mind we have our 9 month son with us so time is valuable. We came on time and had to wait 25 mins for our table. They didn't give us a reason why we had to wait. I didn't find the menu very appealing so I ordered a Pepperoni Pizza. Why? Because it's hard to be disappointed with a Pepperoni Pizza! I was playing is safe. My wife had the Crab Cake and didn't finish it. Note to management, if a customer just takes a bite and doesn't eat the rest, I recommend asking if the customer would like to order something else or take the item off their check, especially if you know it wasn't liked. Our waitress was busy with other diners. She didn't even take our drink order. Had to flag her down and let her know we want to order drinks. Back to the pizza, it was good. Cheesy and greasy just the way a pizza should be. Our other 2 guest has some pasta and steak, they didn't complain so I'm assuming it was good. We payed around $250 for 3 drinks, one app, and four entrees. Not bad for Vegas. The place definitely needs to improve on their guest experience.",

I also liked how they acommodated our party of 10 in a huge square table where we could all talk to each other and share food without anyone being too far. This place gets busy so get there early or expect to wait a few before being seated, but it's a large place so it shouldn't take too long.

When I arrived, we asked the hostess for a table outside since the weather was amazing, and this restaurant's outdoor patio is directly on the Las Vegas strip across from the Bellagio water fountain display. The hostess showed us some available tables, and we asked for one that was directly in the sunlight (our bad). After sitting there for about 10 minutes it began to get uncomfortable. We didn't even have to ask our waiter about moving, because a manager named Matt approached us and asked us if we would prefer to be moved to a spot that was shaded!  I had the jambalaya and my associate ordered the salmon. They were both excellently prepared and arrived at our table in good order. Everything about the experience was excellent and I will be bringing future business lunches here.",

I have never had such an attentive, personable server at any restaurant before!!! When my friend and I were deciding what to get to drink, he immediately recommended the favorite HEXX Potion. It was definitely a favorite. Upon being seated, he also immediately noticed that I had an injured arm and tried to make light of my unfortunate situation, which was so appreciated after a week of, \"I'm so sorry\" or \"that sucks\". He was great. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. UH-MAZING. He immediately noticed from a distance I was struggling using my left hand (I'm right handed). He strolled right over and assisted in putting a portion of the calamari on my small plate. When I thought he couldn't get any better... I ordered the rib eye, not thinking about having to cut the steak.... he sees that the food was brought to the table and immediately walks over and begins to cut my streak for me!!! Talk about service. I was so impressed, I will only come back to be put in his section!!! Thank you, Kevin, for the best dinner!!!!!",

When she checked our IDs, our server saw it was my birthday 2 days ago and as she brought out the check she brought out a bowl of ice cream with a few pieces of chocolate and sprinkles. Absolutely unnecessary and soo nice! Everyone at this restaurant from the hostess to the server to the manager could not have been nicer and friendlier, and the food was excellent.

Our waiter was really nice, but took around 30-45 minutes to charge our cards for the bill. This was extremely disappointing. We had thought our waiter maybe forgot about us and went on break with the bill in his apron, maybe he was in the bathroom taking care of business, or maybe he was stealing all of our credit card info! The amount of time to charge 3 cards (split bill) was outrageous. Nonetheless, our cards were eventually charged and we were on our way. I would have loved to give this restaurant a 5 star rating, but due to this major issue it must fall under a 4, which is the utmost generous.",

If a bar does not make a good BloodyMary i get really disappointed, and for the most part many places have crappy tomato juice mixes. Hexx is my absolute go to spot for brunch because not only do they have an amazing bloodymary, they have about 4 options of them, variation in the vodka & flavors infused into them. The one I took a photo of here is the \"campfire Mary\" soooooo delicious!!!! Last time my sister and I shared the big one I forgot the name of it but OMG SO GREAT! It's to much for one person, however if someone wants to drink with you, definitely go for the big one it's totally delicious & worth it. I'm craving one as we speak.  Now moving to the food. Amazing amazing amazing! I ate the Hexx Benedict, mouth watering! Seasoned to perfection, the potato was cooked in a unique was it was a great brunch. My fiance had the French toast with bananas, it was honestly the best French toast I've ever had. The food is delicious & priced fairly, you won't pay an arm & a leg and you will receive a meal of top quality. Hexx is on my must visit list for Las Vegas, definitely give it a try if in Vegas & wanna brunch!",

It wasn't until our last day in the city that we stumbled upon Hexx.   What a modern, open, and spacious place! You'll love eating here and being able to watch the fountain show across the street at the Bellagio.   As this was the last day in Vegas, the thought of endless mimosas almost did me in. I chose iced tea instead. As for brunch entrees, collectively we had: the classic burger, French toast, omelette, and the prime rib sandwich.   Not one person had a complaint. We gobbled up just about everything. These portions are HUGE so don't be turned off by the price. The fries are deliciously seasoned and fresh out the frier.   I inhaled my burger -- it was absolutely delicious. Warning: it appears to have a thousand island dressing (or mayo /kethcup). Make sure to clarify which sauce(s) you want on your burger.   After the meal, make sure to take your receipt to the chocolate store next door and get yourself something half off!",

There were four of us that I made reservations for and it was a little chaotic when we arrived as there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. Our server was great... attentive, knowledgeable and charming.   The food was pretty good. A little pricey and you'll wait at least an hour to get your food... but it's good.  For starters we got the lump crab cake which was good I just wish it was fried a little more. The fried calamari was good but the rings and everything was a lil small... it was good with the ranch and buffalo but I asked for the sauces on the side. I never thought to pair buffalo and calamari together but it works! Two people in our party complained about the buttermilk pancakes not being soft or fluffy enough... I got the chicken and waffles. Chicken was seasoned perfectly and waffle was fluffy. Two people got bottomless mimosas... $24 per person... (makes sense if you're gonna get more than two mimosas since they're $12 each)   All in all, I would good back. But I encourage people to make reservations. As you could be waiting to be seated for a while since it is on the strip so it's really busy!",

The pictures on Yelp make this place look amazing but I should have realized that most happy Yelpers came for brunch. Dinner is something else.  My bf is gluten free but I'm not, and when we ordered two of the same meal but cooked differently, they made both gluten free making mine skip the fries garlic I was craving. They didn't offer to give me me garlic and didn't stop by to check on the table for 20+ minutes. Our waters were not once refilled in the hour we were there, and we were told the appetizer we ordered was gluten free, just to find out AFTER my Celiac-disease boyfriend spilt it with me that it wasn't.  While the location is great and it looks amazing, our service killed any chance for a higher review. We spent $80 on dinner and barely received any service...along with getting the wrong food.   I might try this again for brunch, but I wouldn't return for dinner. I can see why they're on Groupon, and hope they're able to work on their employee training so guests can have a better experience.",

Let me tell you, even with that much discount, IT WAS NOT WORTH IT.  Portions were extremely small and everything was so salty. Only thing that wasn't salty was the heirloom tomato salad. This was the only thing on the menu that was actually good. We ordered bolognese and prime rib sandwich and these were the worst pasta and prime rib sandwich I've ever eaten. I wasn't necessarily expecting Lawrys prime rib sandwich but these were horrible. Instead of prime rib, we got what appears to be deli quality thinly sliced beef. Au jus was think and tasted like mixture of beef stock and A1 sauce.  I think this place is known for breakfast/brunch menu but I'm not sure if I'll even want to try that after our horrible dinner experience. Server was very nice but service was slow.",

It was also lucky that it was a nice day and we could sit outside, because inside the DJ had the music cranked up to 11. If you want to talk, sit outside. If you are seriously into drinking and yelling \"woo woo\" sit inside. They do have patio heaters and you can see the Bellagio fountains across the street.  The service was excellent, very on top of refills and such. The food is inventive and there are lots of breakfasty choices. I had the corned beef hash with poached eggs and asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side - a good idea because it was very bland and thick, more like tasteless mayo. Maybe an \"end of the day\" problem. The hash was a nice mix of vegetables, sweet potatoes, shaved brussel sprouts and corned beef. The poached eggs provided enough of a sauce, for me anyway. We also got the cinnamon bun waffles to share, they were good, and lived up to the promise. I'm not sure I could eat one as a meal, but it's a fun treat. We also tried a couple of items off their special \"90's menu\" and the \"hot pocket\" was good! Essentially an empanada stuffed with meat and cheese.",

I had the chicken and waffles and it was really good and a big portion - I couldn't finish it.  I forgot the name of the drink we had, but it was huge also (it had passion fruit in it).  Near the bar they had a champagne vending machine which was fun to see.  The restaurant was in a great location on the strip (in the Paris hotel).  Overall I recommend checking this place out.",

The patio is a great spot to people watch on the strip and you can see the Bellagio fountains. We started off with the fruit plate and bottomless mimosas. The fruit platter was visually appealing and the fruit tasted very fresh. For our entrees, we both ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs which came with 3 eggs, applewood smoked bacon, potatoes, and an English muffin. We were also given butter, ketchup, and a jam on a separate plate to pair with our food. Everything was delicious. The potatoes were the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- so crispy and seasoned perfectly. I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was delightful.

I was skeptical because I'm always super skeptical about those fancy, shmancy restaurants that serve small portions but charge ridiculous amounts. I had a slight impression that this was going to be one of those restaurants but BOY WAS I WRONG.   I came here on a Friday dinner date night and was seated immediately for two. Right away we were greeted by super friendly servers who were nice, offered recommendations and treated us like royalty! We were already soo impressed!   Located at the front of \"Paris\" right under the Eiffel Tower, its beautifully decorated with a clean, classy, upscale vibe. The menu was just as beautifully crafted as the ambience of the restaurant. They have different options from seafood, gourmet meats, pizzas, etc!   We ended up ordering the \"Big-Eye Poke\" Appetizer and omg, it was easily one of the TOP poke's I've had in my entire life. The fish was SO fresh and seasoning was on point. There were crispy onions/leeks and macadamia nut pieces on top which added and amazing texture to the soft poke fish. Not too salty, not too fishy, just freaking delicious. Me & my bf were literally eating it super slowly to savor every delicious bite.   For entrees, I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon which was SO unbelievably good; crispy on the outside & fluffy & moist on the inside. (BRB salivating while writing this review) They really do cook the salmon PERFECTLY. The salmon is served on top of a \"quinoa\" mixture with black quinoa (YES, BLACK quinoa.. don't worry its freaking wayyy better than it sounds), wild mushrooms, peas, and a lemon-ey gremolatta sauce. This thing was just as crazy delicious as the salmon, so together it was just an explosion of flavors in your mouth. I don't think my body was ready for such deliciousness.   We also ordered the Pan Seared Scallops which was another explosssion of deliciousness. Words cannot express how delicious this food was, friends. My explanations really don't do it any justice. Scallops were light, buttery, fluffy, perfectly crispy yet soft. Came on top of a deliciously creamy puree & various cooked veggies. SO GOOOOOD.   Surprisingly, we were pretty full from all the food even though we expected not to be. Maybe because our mouths were trying to recover from such outrageously delicious flavors. This place is now a new DEFINITE must to go-to in Vegas!! This place is open 24/7 so there are no excuses not to try it out!  By the way, sorry for saying delicious like a billion times. :D",

The noise level/acoustics were so much better outside.  I ordered the tomato/burrata salad to start. The Parmesan tart was way too salty. The salt masked any Parmesan flavor. The tomatoes were beautiful chunks of multicolor heirloom tomatoes but they were super cold as if they had just been pulled from the refrigerator. Tomatoes do NOT need refrigeration.....this changes the texture and flavor!  I ordered the short rib entree. The short rib was really good but the Brussels sprouts it was served with were over-flavored and overwhelming to the plate. My husband ordered the blue cheese crusted steak and there was soooo much blue cheese (with an unusually strong flavor), that he ended up scraping it all off and asking for the Peppercorn sauce which never came until he was finished with his steak.  Also forgot to mention that I ordered a glass of wine upon being seated that took about 30 minutes and a reminder before I got it.   We definitely won't be back.",

When we got there they took us to our seats fairly quick BUT our table and chairs were dirty. When it was brought to the attention of the hostess she looked around and said I don't know where a buss boy is. So we took it upon ourselves to swap chairs for clean ones as she watched and offered no help. Then once seated we sat there for 15-20 mins and no one came to give us water. Another group sat next to us and within a few mins the waiter came and said \"I will be with you in one minute\". Now that we sat there and didn't even get a drink of water we decided it was time to go. There are so many places to eat in Vegas and do not recommend this one.",

Harder to find then we expected but Hexx turned out to be perfect. He got a standard breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and bacon and I was able to get a veggie burger with some breakfast potatoes and coffee to make a burger qualify as breakfast. The food was awesome and the portions were big. Our server was Sean. Sean was friendly, professional, funny, and very attentive. We made quite a few modifications to our order and he brought out exactly what we wanted. They also had a bottomless mimosas deal that we didn't take advantage of because we were heading home after breakfast but I will definitely be going back for the mimosas, the yummy food, the pretty atmosphere, and the great service.",

We sat on the outside patio which has a great view of the strip and you can get some good people watching views lol.",

Our server (Quinn) did a great job. She was busy, but checked on us frequently, while not being intrusive. She has a nice demeanor. The food: delicious!  You MUST try the brioche caramel sticky bun. It is the most wonderful breakfast roll I have ever eaten. We shared it. So good. My breakfast was also very good. Everyone in my group agreed that is was really, really good. Would we go back? YES, definitely. Oh - we had their bottomless mimosas - happy we did. This restaurant is on The Strip, in front of Paris and across the street from The Bellagio. If you sit outside, and don't mind the traffic noise, you'll have a view of the Bellagio fountains. The weather was nice, this was such a great way to kick off our day on a high note. It was a little chilly, but they have heat lamps going on the outdoor patio.",

The restaurant is nicely decorated and very modern.  I wanted to try the carrot cake pancakes and they were so accommodating in letting me order only 1/2 an order.  I also ordered the chilaquiles and a guava mimosa.  Everything was delicious, the pancakes had shredded caramelized carrots in between and on top, it had a dollop of cream cheese frosting.  It was a great excuse to have cake for breakfast.  The chilaquiles were very tasty, not too spicy, so my husband probably would have liked to add something to give it a kick.  Between the two of us, we couldn't finish the pancakes.  Overall, this place is solid.",

Their beer taps were okay not much selection but they have an extensive cocktail list to try out. As for the food the french fries here are idaho cut potatoes; a must try if you're  fry lover. And their margarita pizza was freshly made and cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back to Hexx and remember that the bar is small and tables at the bar are shared and open seating.",

    "text": "Review is for dinner 10/30/16  I had promised to take my wife to a 'nice dinner' before a show at PH next door, we slipped in here after browsing the menu posted outside.  We were quickly seated inside, since it was starting to cool off and windy.  The indoor dining room is lovely, the chairs super comfy.  The server was right there, took our drink orders (just soft drinks).  Nothing on the menu indicated how much they were, was a taken aback to see they charge $4.99 for a coke.  Anyway, before you quit reading,  I want to point out something I didnt see in any review:  \"CNF\"  What is that?  After I questioned it, the waitress told me its a Concession/Franchise fee.  An additional 4.7% of your bill tacked on at the end.  Surveying the menu again, I spotted it, sure enough in very small print at the bottom they state this.  I hope this isnt another monstrous Vegas trend, like 6/5 blackjack, resort fees, or parking fees.  Anyway, just make sure you dont TIP on the TAX nor the CNF.  We were a little short on time, so we both ordered entrees, no appetizers or sides.  Wife ordered Tagliatelle Scampi (shrimp, butter, garlic, wine, parsley, chili in fettuccine noodles) and i ordered 8oz Filet Mignon with roasted asparagus) - medium rare.  Soooooo, out comes the food - now, I ask you, how many pieces of asparagus would you expect? 6 (standard serving)? 8?  How about 3.  Yes, 3.  I know this is an a la carte restaurant,  but if you say it comes with asparagus, I expect a whole serving.  And sadly, for $37, they cant get a piece of Filet Mignon cooked right, its on the done side of medium.  I dont have time to wait for a refire, so I ate anyway, and didnt complain.  I was given every opportunity, but didnt.  The Scampi were fairly small shrimp, i'd guess in the 51-60 range, cooked about right.  But the sauce seemed bland, neither of us detected a hint of garlic.  The 'chile' were shaved pieces used as garnish on top, we both thought pretty inedible.  I wouldve salted this up a bit, but like any haughty restaurant, you wont find salt/pepper at your table.  High prices, a somewhat hidden tack on fee, bland scampi, didnt get the steak right, i'm left at 2 stars.  If we had ordered a full meal and 'real drinks'  we wouldve easily been over $61 each, so its $$$$.",

Really cool decor and awesome patio on the strip for awesome people watching. Had the jambalyay with shrimp, sausage and chicken confit. Big portion but it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked just somewhat hot. My sister and the crab cakes (appetizer) but you get 3 okay sized and they were really good. She also had a side of broccillini which was very tasty as well. My friend had chicken and waffles. Big portion and delicious! Awesome chocolate shop too where they make the chocolate. Definitely a go to if your in the area!",

Once we got to our table, though, I think that we were a bit disappointed; the restaurant forgot to swap out their lunch menu outside with their dinner menu, so the meals we were looking at weren't really an option. I ordered a margherita pizza, which was fantastic, though it was pretty pricy for a 10\" pizza. The actual entrees were even pricier. The establishment itself was really clean and appealing, with outdoor seating available as well. I'd recommend this as a treat or special occasion!",

It's a nice spot for a dinner date with cheap prices for quality Vegas dinning. There are private hole in the wall spots with cushions.

My friends and I decided to give it a try.   There are several options on the menu.   Something for everyone.   I had the Farm Fresh Eggs with bacon, toast, and home fries.    The potatoes are out of this world! They are small size new potatoes that are crisp on the outside, and tender inside.   Very well seasoned, and just delicious!   The strawberry jam for the toast is made from scratch, and is just delicious! The service was great, and the atmosphere is wonderful!  I definitely recommend this restaurant as a breakfast option.",

The outdoor patio has misters that keep you nice and cool and you can see the fountain show at the Bellagio across the street. We had the broccolini for an appetizer that was amazing. It was fried just perfect and had a nice citrus taste to it. The bolognese was to die for. It was different than your run of the mill pasta because was savory and almost had a little sweetness to it.

Hands down best bloody Mary I have ever had. They infuse their own vodka with a mix of peppers. The ambience is pretty cool except that it's  so loud. When we came back, I got tomato basil soup. It was barely warm so I sent it back to be reheated. It had good flavor and was hot when the second time. My friend got the ceaser salad, it was embarrassing. Basically lettuce, parm, olive oil, and croutons. The dressing had absolutely no flavor, it was so disappointing. She was so disgusted that we elected to cancel the rest of our meal. We watched people at other tables send their food back as well. I ordered a Sierra mist after drinking too much alcohol the past few days and it was 5 dollars!!! What a rip off. Our server Denise was amazing though, so sweet and helpful. Even the free chocolate was disappointing. Skip this place unless you just want a bloody Mary and guac.",

Our dessert The banana cream pie, we questioned her on after flagging her to our table. The crust was EXTREMELY HARD, we thought it was frozen, but she said no. Ok, it was a graham cracker crust that could not be cut with a knife. 3  people tried. Jambalaya was SO spicy that a lot was leftover. Here's the BIGGEST THING, check your bill and be prepared, they add on a \"cnf \" fee. No this is not sales tax, this to literally to help them pay their rent. Lol. We asked about this charge, they would not take it off our bill. It's not listed in small print like you see additional fees/service charges in other restaurants.

The chicken was chicken strips and kind of meager for the price. The pizza was good, not impressive. Hex felt like a tourist trap. Overpriced for average food.

Only 2 small groups were before us! After being seated we counted and only about 12 tables were taken and most of them were party of 2! It took 45 minutes for the food to come and the Mac n cheese was cold. The veggie pizza was hot but bland. The calamari was also hot but fatty and cheap bar snack type. The waiter knew exactly what was going on. He apologized and offered discount from the manager which was appreciated. That is the reason for my 3 stars. Otherwise the food and service was one star. It seemed that the kitchen was low on skilled staff. My party's previous experience was much better. To give them the benefit of doubt, I will try Hexx one more time to see if it is any better.",

    "text": "So I found this place whilst walking along the strip and the smell caught my attention! So glad to have discovered this place and would definitely recommend!   I came for Saturday brunch and surprisingly the wait wasn't as bad as I had thought. There's a candy store connected to the restaurant that's fun to check out while you wait. Once they texted us that our table was ready, we sat down inside and had a lovely view of the Paris Paris hotel next store. The interior of this place is super cosy! It's super bright and fresh inside and not over the top \"fancy\".   Service was a bit slow, but the food was so good that it made up for that! I ended up getting the club sandwich and it hit the spot ! The sandwich itself was huge and it had this almost sweet bread that ended up being the perfect complement to the salty flavours of the sandwich. The fries were also super crispy and good. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and they were to die for!! The eggs were cooked to perfection and tasted heavenly with that smoked salmon. The side of potatoes were also heavenly. Would've loved to have tried the dinner food here as well! The pizza looked amazing!   Additionally for brunch time, they have bottomless mimosas here for around 20$ if I remember correctly. They were super good, although after 4, the taste was too much.   All in all, if you're looking for a good brunch/ dinner place with a big variety of different foods and you wanna try something new, give this place a shot! It can be bit expensive at around 15-25$ /plate but it's on the strip so what do you expect?",

Glad we did. We were seated in the patio right away. Ordered a 1/2 veggie and 1/2 pepperoni pizza and a pitcher of Sculpin. Kids devoured the pepperoni pizza and wifey and I finished of the veggie slices. Pizza was very good and the ice cold beer went down smooth (was probably in the upper 40's outside but the heaters outside did a great job keeping us warm). Service was great as well. With the view to the Bellagio fountains and people watching, I would recommend.",

The staff is very nice and the restaurant is very pretty yet casual. I love that the atmosphere is relaxed but has a higher end feel. We all ordered the bottomless mimosas which were $23 each person and shared the smothered fries. The smothered fries were very good. The fries held up very well even though they were topped off with gravy, pulled pork, cheese curds and cheddar cheese!  For my entree I ordered the corned beef hash. It really was not what I expected. Its made with grated sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. It was good but what disappointed me was that it was missing the crispiness that I expect with corned beef hash. I did however enjoy  the poached egg, great touch!   I tried a bite of my friends entrees also. I really liked the Johnny cakes great texture. I would not recommend the chilaquiles, they are pretty much nachos. The tortilla chips do not hold up well at all. The majority of them were very soggy.  So overall I enjoyed the restaurant itself, service was good, and food was good but not as expected from reading the menu",

These large mixed drinks were served over dry ice, and it was so fun! Definitely unique.  I got the pappardelle pasta by recommendation of our server, and I thought it was delicious! Others around me got the jambalaya and hexx burger, and everyone was happy with their selections. From our experience, anything you order will be great!",

We weren't in the mood for a full meal as we already had dinner reservations, but really in search of a snack. We walked in and were seated promptly.  Service: Service was rather inattentive for it being so slow - in between lunch and dinner.  It took a while to take our orders and our waters went empty for at least 5 minutes without being refilled.  Food: The Cheese and Charcuterie board was good.  Both the cheese selection and meats were standard with nothing to write home about.  The large pretzel as the bread component was an odd choice but it worked well with the whole grain mustard on the board.  Decor:  The modern farmhouse style was nice and comfortable.  The acoustics made it nice so that we could hold a conversation without having to yell.  Our seats also had a good view of the Bellagio fountains.  Overall an OK experience worth another try of their other menu items.",

    "text": "This is my first time in Vegas and on my last day here, me and some friends went to HEXX.  I'll make this short because we got a lot of stuff to do but I wanted to write a quick review first:  Our waiter Shawn is great! He is so professional, attentive and super friendly. Also, he is very fast at getting something we needed, like water and hot sauce. I am very satisfied we had him as our waiter.   Also, I ordered chilaquiles and the portion size was very good- not too much and not too little. I ordered it without cheese and it was really delicious- light but crunchy, not too heavy on the sauce and just enough sour creme that the chips weren't drowning in it.   We sat outside and this guy on the street who was singing from a karaoke machine serenaded everyone with hits from Phil Collins and Lionel Richie. This kinda stuff adds to the already awesome, offbeat experience of being in Vegas!  So pretty much at HEXX, Shawn and the guy singing on the street made the best experience for my last day here!! Thanks!!",

We were sat right away and had ordered our drinks and appetizers within minutes of sitting down. Service was fast and the drinks were amazing!  Did I mention the drinks???oh yes, the bloody Mary's have to be the best in town. Ordered the colossal and it was a total meal by itself. Great flavors and great drink. I would definitely recommend ordering this drink any time of the day.   The food was great. Friends ordered the classic burger and it looked mouthwatering. I myself  ordered the Margherita pizza and it was pretty yummy.   Overall I would recommend this place to anyone. Great service, amazing food and drinks and beautiful ambiance (especially with Bellagios water show right out the door). Go to it...you won't be disappointed.",

Tonight, I came to this establishment, expecting similar results, and was completely disappointed. The outside patio was not slammed at all (I worked in food industry for 5 years) but the server was completely rude to us. We had horrible service. The waiter Kevin, was nice and friendly to every patron in the establishment, but was very rude and delayed to my party of 2. When we asked for the check, he simply placed it, when we asked for a box, he rudely placed it without uttering a word of conversation. It was completely different than the way he was interacting with other guests. I must say, I was excited about this new eatery I discovered being that I went here twice in one week, but I will not be coming back.",

They always have great vegetarian options, and the portions are hearty - essential if you plan on making a day or night of it in Vegas. The atmosphere is beautiful. You can sit outside and watch the Bellagio fountains every 15 minutes, or you can sit inside and enjoy a really chic and cozy atmosphere. The bar is set apart from the restaurant and has an even cozier vibe - little loveseats, perfect for double dates. The drinks are well made, though I've never dabbled in their signature drinks that smoke! Quite a show :) Definitely recommend the sparkling rose!!",

I ordered the Sausage Breakfast pizza, which turned out to be enough for two people, and was also very good. This was the same order that we had the last time that we ate breakfast at SF, and the execution of the food was identical.

Domaine Ott rose is not common in a restaurant so that was most enjoyable while watching the fountains dance! He had the surf and turf sliders. Interesting, but not recommended. What did detract though was the live band at the Alexas bar right next door competing with the music and the ambience at Hexx! No bueno! I'd suggest sitting outside on the patio when the weather is good and watching The Fountains having an appetizer and a glass of wine and calling it a day.",

We had the chicken and waffles, cinnamon roll waffles, eggs Benedict and the protein egg white omelet.  The egg white omelet was mine and I know it sounds boring but I am trying to be good with my diet even while on vacation.  I am so glad I ordered it because it was delicious and not boring but was definitely not great for the diet!  I believe they used roasted dark meat chicken and of course cooked in a good amount of oil/butter.  It came with roasted potatoes that were a bit salty but also cooked perfectly with crunch bits and an English muffin which the kids ate - so much food!  I assume the eggs Benedict was good but my son devoured it in short order.  The dessert breakfast cinnamon roll waffles my daughter had was delicious.  My husbands chicken & waffles was also great but I thought the cheddar waffles would have a bit more cheddar flavor.  Would go back",

Other people were complaining that they were told to wait at the bar and after a much longer wait they were told that they would have to wait all over again for a table.

After we order the water,it take forever to get to my table . I probably won't come back cs I know  other places with way better food and fast service. Like China poblano for example.

The food was great but the servers Jessica and Kevin stole the show! Rarely do you find wait staff more genuine. They are good people, engaging and passionate about their craft.   Great dessert, cool vibes, incredible service, a beautiful fountain while people watching! What more do you need?",

The veggie burger is made with beans and quinoa, which is a welcomed change from portobello patties or patties that are essentially rice cakes. There is a pretty decent beer selection as well.  The service here is also fantastic. Sean, our waiter, had a super knowledge of the menu (for example, he knew by memory that the Caesar salad had anchovies in the dressing and was not suitable for vegetarians). He was also very attentive and very amiable throughout the entire lunch. I thought he did a categorically outstanding job.  We certainly will be coming back here.",

We waited 45 minutes for our food, and judging by the ice cold steak placed in front of me, our food waited for quite a while too. My eggs, ordered over medium, were basically raw. My tablemate's diablo Bloody Mary was just horrible, although the other bloody Mary's we ordered were decent. To top off the already mediocre experience, we were seated in the rain and had to move to a new table ourselves after asking the waitstaff to move us several times. Not the experience I expect when paying $40/head pre-alcohol.",

    "text": "DINNER REVIEW  As most of these reviews are for brunch I felt compelled to share our experience for dinner here. Hexx could possibly be the best on Las Vegas Blvd restaurants. The views/service/food was simply fantastic.  We got a great table on the patio where we were met by Kevin. A funny but great server! He was great with suggestions and really made our experience great. We started off with the crab cakes and spinach artichoke dip. The crab cakes were delicious. Very clean and fresh tasting and I love how the sauce that came with it was very light and did not drown out the crab cake.  The spinach artichoke was great too, one of the best I had.  For dinner, I had the short rib and my lady had the seabass. The short rib came with a delicious mash and Brussel sprouts on the plate. It was fantastic. One of the best things I've ever eaten. The short rib was so soft it was easy to simply flake with a fork.  My lady's Seabass was phenomenal. It was so unbelievably fresh and clean. The dish itself was so refreshing and delicious. It wasn't fishy at all and was super mild. Seared to perfection and perfectly cooked.  One of my favorite things parts about Hexx is the chocolate bar. After we had our meal, Kevin walked us over to the chocolate bar where we got to see chocolatiers make chocolate from scratch and got the chance to taste all the chocolates they offer.  Overall, with the great food, service, and views, this restaurant is the best bang for your buck on the strip. I love the experience of the chocolate factory next door. Finally a restaurant on the strip that offers more than just great food, but a great experience as well. Well done Hexx! We'll be back and so should you!",

Get the check and we wait another 15 min for her to come back and when she does she said \"do you need change\" I have always found that disrespectful and greedy you should just bring the money back and let the customer leave what they want.

    "text": "Location, location, location! HEXX has prime real estate on the strip. You get a great view of the Bellagio fountains from the patio section. The food is okay and a little overpriced (but whatever, its Vegas!) but the location can't be beat! The patio serves as a great refuge from all the sun and is a good spot for some people watching. The inside was nicely decorated as well but it was beautiful day outside the day we came.   Although the patio is first come, first served - we made a request for it in our reservation and they were able to easily accommodate us. We ordered the smothered fries for the table to share. They tasted just how you would expect -  fries smothered with gravy and cheese. This dish came out extremely fast which was a good thing for us because we needed something to munch on after a night of drinking. They could have let the cheese melt for longer though because in some sections, the cheese was a coagulated mess. Our table of 4 ordered all three of the omelet options (protein, veggie, and meat). Omelets were all okay - kinda wish we ordered something else but everyone was feeling eggs. The smashed potatoes that were served with the omelets were pretty good and seasoned well. Pricing is reasonable for Las Vegas. Oh...they provide you with dark chocolate at the end with cute little \"spells\". Cute touch! I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again but it was just the type of place we needed to chill at after a night out.",

We had the pork rinds as an appetizer, then the spaghetti & meatballs and the short rib plates. The short rib was nice and tender atop fluffy & tasty mashed potatoes and the spaghetti was a nice portion. I was appreciative of the reasonably priced Prosecco on the menu. I really liked the chocolate fortune and the view is great for people watching and taking in the Vegas vibes. Will recommend to everyone back home!",

She was very happy! :) tried their espresso Manhattan.. was interesting.  over all great experience.. Only negative comment will be, that it's very loud in there and couldn't hear each other cross the table.  but very open and nice environment. will be back",

Comes out really quick and while you're waiting the endless mimosas don't hurt. The weekend I went there was a big festival going on and it seemed like one huge party in there. The servers were so nice, I remember talking to a waiter about the opening of the Janet Jackson show that was happening that night. It was a great time. We ended up coming here twice on our short 3 day trip. The food is also very reasonably priced. This will be a staple on my Vegas getaways from now on.",

The spinach dip was a nice start. A warm cheesy mix with some crispy edges, but an almost full basket of chip pieces, rather than whole chips made scooping it up difficult.   The Shrimp Limone was almost great. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the surrounds did not display the finesse you'd expect. It was almost sloppy.   In any other city in America, this would be a radically overpriced restaurant. In LV, average. Because of this crazy overpricing of food in Vegas, you tend to rate meals based on typical prices. That being the fact, this would clearly be a 3 Star. In LV where water is expensive, I have no choice but to rate it 4.",

The servers were really good about making sure our glazed were always filled so we got our monies worth.   I got the eggs Benedict which was different but good. I really liked the potatoes instead of the English muffin. The hollandaise sauce was a good consistency, not too thick.   We had a Groupon which the manager took care of immediately.  Overall it was good service, food and mimosas!",

The wait was about 30 min for brunch (on a Sunday) but the views and the ambience were definitely pretty dope. The menu had a variety of options so if you wanted pizza, nachos, or breakfast, it was available. Ordered the French Toast for about $12 but unfortunately there's no \"combo\" type option, so you have to add some sides for about $4-5 each depending on what you get. French Toast wasn't anything special to look at, nothing creative, however (comma) the brioche bread was really good .. an added benefit is being able to watch the Bellagio water shows while you eat from inside or outside .. Would definitely would recommend a drop in if you're near the Paris Eiffel Tower",

It's nice to people-watch and also get a clear view of the Bellagio water fountain show. Winning!   The food was delicious. What we ordered:   -- Cheesy Bread for appetizer - It came out warm and golden. Eat it right away while it's hot! It was absolutely delicious!   -- Eggs Benedict with Au Gratin Potatoes - When it came out, it looked average, but don't let this fool you. It was Really good! One of the tastiest Eggs Benedict I've ever had (and I've had a lot). Love the salty, sweet, creamy flavors -- all in one!   -- Carrot Cake Pancakes - Good, but it didn't taste much like carrot cake? I couldn't hardly taste the carrot at all. It just tasted like normal pancakes, but it was good nonetheless.  -- Tiramisu dessert - I was expecting something that looked and tasted more like the traditional Tiramisu cake... but this one had a nice presentation, although you basically get bread with chocolate, coffee, amaretto, and cream on the side. You just put everything together yourself. I wasn't feeling it. Let's just say, it looked better than it tasted! Would pass on this...  Service was good, but expect to be charged for everything. When the pancakes came out, it didn't look like the yelp picture which had whip cream on it. The waitress was nice to offer taking it back for whip cream (which was delicious btw), but failed to advise me that there will be a $3 charge for it. I thought it was included with the pancakes?? It wasn't much, but as a courtesy if they're charging extra for something, I think they should mention it.   Brunch came to $80 which was a bit expensive for brunch, but what do you expect from Vegas? We didn't order much except those 4 items, plus 3 juices and 1 coffee for 2 adults & 1 child. I would come here again though because loved the ambience and food.",

Location is also super prime, right across from the Bellagio Fountains so if you're sitting outside (which I highly recommend) you'll have great views of the bustling strip and the fountains.   The food here is on par with the location. I had the Chicken & Waffles which were fantastic! And the Carrot Cake Waffles on the menu looked so good we just had to get it as well. Long story short we ordered more than we could handle but it was totally worth it! Highly recommend this location to all you brunchaholics out there!",

I had the Hexx Benedict and it was like a pile of gloop. The eggs were runny and that's normally fine on an English muffin or drier carb, but on scalloped potatoes it just became a messy affair, with it just being a liquid, unpleasant ooze.  The mimosas weren't all that good either. It tasted like crappy orange juice concentrate was used with cheap champagne.  Overall this place wasn't that great and I'd avoid coming back here.",

Until we were seated and noticed legitimately 15-20 dirty tables with no customers at the tables, waiting to be cleaned, with nobody cleaning them. And dozens of tables waiting to be seated. That's unacceptable.   Food took a LONG time to come out, around 50-60 minutes. Tables next to us who were seated before us got their food much quicker than us, a table of three. When we ask our waitress, she proceeds to disappear for another 15mins without explanation, then the food comes out after that time. With no apologies or explantation. I guess she just pretended that never happened...  Food was okay, not the worst, not the best. It's fine. But the service and management of this restaurant might have been the worst I've seen in Vegas.",

After being seated, it took us 20 minutes to be asked for our drink order and then another 30 minutes to receive our drinks. It was not even a complicated order, simply 4 beers, two glasses of wine and a couple of vodka tonics. The place was far from packed and the bar just had two people sat at it, so to have to wait nearly an hour for drinks was completely horrendous. In addition to that, one of our party ordered a steak cooked rare and it turned up medium well done. When he spoke to the waiter, he then removed just the steak, leaving the rest of the meal and returned 15 minutes later with it cooked properly. Meaning the rest of the meal was cold by the time his steak turned up! To top things off, they did not comp the steak until we complained to the manager. The rest of the food was actually pretty decent when it turned up, but at that point our night was ruined. My tip is for you not to go here, unless you don't intend on doing anything else that night.",

It's $23 for the mimosas or you can get a $36 Bloody Mary which also looks on point but I am more of the bottomless type   One disappointment I had was the fact that you can't mix juices on the mimosas, I prefer passion fruit or pineapple in my mimosas but I choked down the orange bc it was a good ratio.  We ordered the chilaquiles and the french dip which were yummy, but I have had better in my home town (hard to beat San Antonio chilaquiles). They also brought the champagne ice free for my birthday which was really tasty!!",

Everyone who tended to our table was awesome, and our server even went out of his way to see if the chef could make something for us that wasn't on the current menu. Now the actual review- overpriced and mediocre. But that's generally been my experience with most restaurants similar to this. Very modern menu items that sound interesting, subpar execution. I know they are not a steakhouse, but I think medium rare is pretty self explanatory. The steak was hardly even pink in the center. I also had the calamari and surf n' turf sliders. The calamari was well cooked, but I was not a huge fan of the Buffalo sauce on top or the fact that almost half of the dish was sliced carrots and celery. The sliders were almost good, but it was just a miss as far as flavor goes. The short rib on the sliders was dry, and they were cold within a couple of minutes of arriving at the table because there was so much coleslaw on them. The sauce on the short rib just didn't work well with the lobster slaw. I wouldn't recommend them. Their pizza was very good! I'd say that was the best value and flavor of all of the menu items I tried.",

We choose the outside patio, as it quieter and quite lovely. The waiter greeted us and they offered three types of water: Pellegrino, Fiji, and tap. One of the reasons we choose the patio is because you can see the fountains of Bellagio show beautiful entertainment while you wait for your meal.   We ordered the shrimp scampi, spaghetti with meatballs and the chicken parmesan! Everyone enjoyed the food with some white wine as well. They also have a very large selection of wines which was really nice!  I must say that you do have to wait for your food, so don't be in a rush (the fountain show makes the time go by a lot quicker).  My scampi was very good, the sauce wasn't too thick and very buttery. They are also really generous with the shrimp! And the bread was my favorite part soft and buttery nicely toasted.   Definitely, a place to try on the strip!",

The tortilla chips were so soggy almost as though it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before they brought it out. I was not impressed and the food did not make up for the wait at all.",

    "text": "After coming down from the top of the Eiffel Tower, we decided to get something for dinner. Leaving Paris Casino, we immediately walked right past Hexx and decided to try it since it had decent reviews and was still open. It was probably well past midnight at this point, but Hexx is open 24 hours so we were able to get a table without having to wait.   We got a table on the patio which sits right on the Vegas Strip so it is the ultimate location for people watching. We decided to split an order of Spinach and Artichoke Dip for an appetizer and then also decided to split their Ribeye Steak. Everything we ordered was good. The Artichoke Dip was pretty much what you expect. The Ribeye was large and cooked to a perfect medium. It was served with asparagus. Again, everything was really good, but nothing was outstanding...  Our service was pretty good. The restaurant has a cool modern style and great location. The prices are a little on the higher end, but not bad.",

The French toast my wife ordered was insanely delicious. I ordered the breakfast croissant and I'm pretty sure I just ate food from heaven. By far the best place for brunch in Vegas!!!",

This is a ridiculous unexplained fee. Even worse no one can really quite tell you what it is for. If it wasn't for the deal we got I'd take my business elsewhere!",

We're regulars, never seen these two before, but we're like we're here so whatever.   10 mins standing around and we're told we can't be seated because we have a dog who's in his stroller. Even though we were here two weeks ago with our dog, in his stroller, and the staff loved him and couldn't stop making a big deal about him. It's like the restaurant changed staff overnight. We explain we were just here and had never heard this rule and Twink says he'll bring the manager over. Our dog is ADA certified so we figure, we'll just show his certificate. But the manager, Christian, with his bow tie and cummerbund comes over guns blazing, telling he's refusing us service and dogs aren't allowed on the strip. Are you kidding me? Please hire people with half a brain and some sense.   This place literally makes me laugh because a bunch of minimum wagers on a power trip work here and are lucky to have a job at all, I don't know who hires people who can't even smile and have no presentation. I've decided to stop coming here because this place is garbage. Every day it's a new rule, they're all so entitled for no reason, have zero education and it shows. Keep on making your minimum guys for the new week or so before your establish closes.",

Inside there was a nice row of couches available and we hung out for a few minutes until our table was ready.  To start, we shared an order of the twisted sticky bun. We had been debating between starting with that or an order of the carrot cake pancakes and the server helped us decide. I think we made the right decision. It's a large bun similar to \"monkey bread\" where small pieces can be easily pulled apart and it's perfect to share.  For our main dishes, we got an order of the chicken & waffles, and also the Hexx Benedict. Both dishes are staples for us when we go out to brunch, and Hexx delivers these classics in True Vegas \"indulgence\" style. We were not disappointed.  The atmosphere at Hexx is low-key and open. It's perfect for a nice sunny day and is great people watching out on the strip.",

(It was Mother's Day and was packed, but they still had a table for me right away.)  The waiter was attentive, but not too attentive.  They had something on the menu that looked, um, interesting - \"Lox and Chive Waffles\".  I wasn't sure about the idea of lox without a bagel, but the waiter assured me that the waffle wasn't sweet, but had chives in it.  So I tried it.  The lox and other toppings (hard boiled eggs, onion, sour cream, cucumber, etc.) came separate on the side of the waffles and you assemble the way you like.  It was fabulous!  I would definitely go back!",

Fun music was playing and everyone was kind of grooving in their seats to the music. We opted to sit indoors rather than outdoors which had a lovely view of the fountains and great people watching but it was 105 the day we were there.   Our server, Tracee, was wonderful. Very fun and high energy and fast. Her station was full and she had a smile on her face the whole time.  Hubby had french toast and I had the chicken and waffles. Both were very delicious. My chicken and waffle was a huge portion. We could have split it. In fact, I gave hubby a big piece of my chicken since I had more than enough and he needed some protein. The fried chicken was excellent!  The mimosas were also good. The pre mix the oj and the bubbly into pitchers so they can refill glasses quickly. I would have preferred not having them pre-mixed just because too much acidity in the oj can bother me. However it wasn't a deal breaker.  Will definitely return on our next trip!",

Our service was impeccable, Tracee with to e's, was incredible, she was funny and attentive, a perfect way to start our day! There were eight of us at breakfast and we all ordered something different! Everything was delicious, with the exception of the Carnitas Hash! Which was described as runny and soggy. We started the meal off with a fruit plate which was not your ordinary fruit plate, it had all kinds of interesting flavors like Dragon Fruit and Japanese Apple. We also ordered sides of the aged bacon, also a delicious choice. The protein omelette with avocado mousse was delicious and the breakfast potato's were some of the best I have ever had in my life! The ham and cheese croissant with an egg was a popular choice, we saw it on a guests table and two members of our group decided that that was what they had to have. They said it did not disappoint. I had the Cinnamon Apple pancakes with oat crumble and brown sugar butter! The brown sugar butter was candy delicious! This establishment offered unlimited mimosas and when in Vegas, you have to partake! This was hands down one of the best breakfasts of my life, a fabulous find in Vegas!

    "text": "Really a great experience here!  Came for late lunch/early dinner, so it wasn't too crowded. Got a seat outdoors (which, by the way, is great for watching the Bellagio fountain show, and also for just general people watching-the outdoor seating alone gives this place an edge).   Ordered the mushroom pizza, which was honestly huge-could have easily been shared, but I was by myself, so what is one to do? Desert was, of course, phenomenal, being that Hexx chocolate shop is right there-I usually say you can't go wrong with chocolate, but that is really True here.  Service was great, from the hostess station to my server, David. Pretty average prices for Vegas. So good food, delicious desert, amazing view, and outstanding service-what more can you ask for?",

    "text": "Came here for Brunch after our Paris Staycation.  We made reservations for 1130am and when we arrived we were given a table outside looking over the Bellagio fountains.  The view alone was awesome, sunny day and great for people watching.  We started out by ordering 2 Farmers Markets Bloody Mary's which included bacon infused gin, and garnished with bacon, white cheddar cheese, pepper stuffed olive and beef stick.  The Bloody Mary's alone were like an appetizer themselves!  On top of our Bloody Mary's we also ordered the overcooked bacon which was like ordering extra crispy bacon.  Since there was already bacon in the Bloody Mary's we probably should've went with a different appetizer, but I guess you can never have too much bacon right?  Our entrees arrived shortly after and I went with the lobster roll, while my boyfriend had the frittata.  The plating was cute but to be honest I was surprised how small the portions were, I would say there were a little on the smaller side but I was still full when we were done.  Our server was very attentive along with other employees in the dining rooms making sure our waters were filled, plates were cleared away etc.  The only reason why I took away some stars were for the pricing.  The service was great, ambiance and view was great, but after using an Open Table Dining credit of $50 and after paying CNF fees, balance due was still $51.40 so a total of $101.40 for 2 people before dining credit for brunch.  I guess this is what you expect from dining on the strip, either way, I would still recommend if you are looking for a good Bloody Mary on the strip with a great view.   *CNF fees, not listed anywhere else but apparently is a Concessions and Franchise fee that is included with this restaurant.  I didn't ask about it since I heard some restaurants on the strip may start charging this.",

Plus we ordered 2 Croissants to share.  The table was full of plates after they delivered and we said no way we could eat everything.  Well...long story short the plates were clean when we left!  We ended sharing or at least tasting everything.  The Eggs Benedict was the best I ever had!  They served it on French Style potatoes layered with gruyere cheese.  SIMPLY AMAZING!!!  Order Croissants for the table but do yourself a favor...order with a side of house made cream cheese sauce. PS...service was the best!!!!",

We also had the passion fruit margarita potion (3 of them.....don't judge us, it's a bachelorette!) and it was absolutely delicioso.....we all felt good when we left there. It was a Friday night and wasn't too crowded. We sat at an outside table just under the Eiffel tower and were able to people watch while we enjoyed our meal. Stephanie was our server and she was awesome. Very friendly, answered all of our questions and very attentive. Overall a positive experience!",

Had our drink orders taken shortly after being seated and our food shortly after that. I orders the banana nut French toast and she ordered the regular buttermilk pancakes.

    "text": "I appreciate the ambition to do fresh food as the menu states and not to use mass produced product.  My wife and I are both disappointed with the food. Perhaps we're being a bit unfair since we had dinner yesterday at one of Ramsay's restaurants, but we're not likely going to be back. Too many other better choices.  The broccolini starter was so pungent and the florets so overly dried out that after one bite we asked that it be removed.  The waiter removed it from our table but not the bill. Disappointing.  My wife had the scampi. The sauce was thin and lacked flavor. She's had scampi at many fine restaurants and knows her stuff. I tried it and thought exactly the same.  I decided to go safe after the broccolini incident and went with the classic burger. I asked for it prepared medium. It was medium well but still juicy. The cheddar they chose has good flavor but is extra dry so is not a good melting cheese. This dry texture on a juicy burger may not be for all.  My burger came with simple French fries. They looked good but we're quite soft.  Overall the atmosphere is quite good, it's modern but touches remind you this is at the Paris hotel. The service was fine. It's located directly across from the Bellagio so the view is good.  Is this restaurant the Paris Hotel's answer to the Bellagio Cafe since both are open 24 hours?  It only wins if you care less about food and more about a patio with a view.",

Now that it's changed to Hexx the coffee is not great, but the food is still average. Today we came with a specific request to sit by the railing on the patio - a request that came with a wait. We waited for our table and we were placed on the patio far from the rail. As a local, we don't pay strip prices for something less than what we ask for ... we requested to be moved to one of the several open rail tables and were told we would have to wait. Seeing as how we had already waited, this was upsetting. A conversation with the \"manager\" revealed that she wouldn't move us because people specifically wait for those tables ... read above. She was very unpleasant and unapologetic for the lack of service. We left today and didn't have breakfast. We will not be coming back and hope that tourists heed our warning - you will pay a lot for breakfast here, it's not worth the cost when the food is average but the service is terrible.",

Our waiter was such a cutie and very good at what he does. I ate the Margherita Pizza for the first time and thought it was delicious. My friends order stake and some other things and we all thought our food was perfect. To top it all off, they brought me out an ice cream Sunday since we were there to celebrate my birthday.",

The food was wonderful and I had no issues with any of the dishes we ordered. They are a bit pricey for what you get but its Vegas so it's expected.   Our server with the red hair was a gem, super sweet. The only thing that got irritating was how long we waited for everything. It took forever to get the menus, to order, to get the manager to approve our groupon, and to get our check. We got there around 8 and didn't leave until 9:30. 30 minutes was wasted due to waiting around for the check AFTER the manager came to apply our groupon.   For the prices and the service wait I would rather go to a different restaurant.   I'll pass on this in the future.",

    "text": "After traveling that day into Vegas with a group of 6, we were eager to find something to eat but had no idea what we really wanted. We were staying at Planet Hollywood and decided to venture onto the strip to find something to eat. Paris was right next door, and I had read that Hexx was a great place to check out. After viewing the menu outside, we thought we'd give it a try.  Our waitress was awesome. She answered any questions we had with menu items and thoroughly went through the drink menu - as we were thirsty! She recommended a few items and let us take our time to order; this was around 5:15 pm on a Monday.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, opting to try something different at our first place to eat for the few days we were in Vegas. My husband got the Filet Mignon. Both were excellent. Others in our party got another meat, a couple pastas and the crab cakes. Everyone said that their meal was very good. One of our party ordered one of the pitcher drinks that had smoke when another drink was poured into it. I cannot remember the name, but it was cool to watch and was a good drink.  Overall, it was a great place to eat on our first night in Vegas. The service was great and the food was even better. They gave you chocolates with a little fortune when you receive the check. It was a dark chocolate, and although I prefer milk chocolate... it was still nice to try.",

Also, server forgot that my drink was ordered on the rocks. Server said he would correct it and left. I slowly sipped my drink while he was gone, wondering what he was up to. When I was halfway through my drink, he finally came back with some ice which he then poured into my drink... what?  Anyways, food was great and prices were not bad for its location. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and that fourth star despite the slowness and questionable service.",

The bacon appetizers and cinnamon waffle are my favorite. Sean was our server-- hands down, the best server we've ever had. He was personable, attentive, prompt, and kind. He made good recommendations and kept the ice tea refills coming. I would give Sean 5 stars. I gave Hexx only 4 stars because while the food is good, it isn't outstanding. I asked for my fries well done, and they were floppy, and my cranberry turkey sandwich was a tad dry, but still tasty. I look forward to our next visit.

I have passed this place  multiple times while walking on the Vegas strip but I never stopped until this most recent visit. There is not usually a wait here (well not on the two times we visited two weeks ago) and the staff is really friendly! If there is a wait, they take your phone number at the front and send a text message, which I think is better than having a buzzer that cannot go far.  They also have bottomless mimosas for only $20 bucks (which I think is winning)! While here I ordered a side of bacon, an omelet, and a sticky bun. Our server (on both days we went) were very nice and friendly! My server from the first day also stopped by our table on the second day to say hello, and say she was happy to see us come back. The manager also stopped by on our second visit here to check on the hubby and I, and make sure we were being well taken care of. She was very friendly as well, and I appreciated her stopping by to check on customers ( she checked on every table to speak with customers--just amazing customer service). The sticky bun we ordered was AMAZING! We asked for extra Carmel glaze to make it stickier and more delicious and BOY WAS IT! My bacon was also cooked to perfection and the way I wanted it! My omelet was okie, I might have took a wrong turn by ordering ham, but I could not finish it. I also loved being able to enjoy the water show at the Bellagio, while we waited for our food (great views all over the restaurant). I am def. stopping back by HEXX on my next visit to Vegas!",

Also at the table next to us  the guy got a rib eye 2x and left the 2nd after one bite. If you are looking for an overpriced place where you don't want to go back to the Hexx is the place to be.",

My SO got the hypnotizing strawberry drink which everyone else ended up getting as well.  I was a little skeptical at first when Jay, our waiter, said that everything he's tried has been great. He was not lying! We all shared the plates and everything was tasty. I would say my favorite was the jambalaya. I was worried it would be too spicy so I asked the chef if he could tone it down and he did well for my baby taste buds!  I would definitely go again!",

My friends ordered the crispy broccolini (WOW!), overcooked bacon (surprisingly good) and the chilequiles (also amazing!). I got to taste everything while sipping on my delicious drink. The atmosphere was fun, too. A very relaxing spot and the view is of the Bellagio fountains. We all agreed that we'd like to go back and eat there again. We didn't make it back on that trip but I know I will next time I'm in Vegas!",

The only thing that came was my sons milk. We were seated at 9:15 came to us at 9:35 and at 10:10pm we still had no dinner. Since I asked for our check for the milk because I was ready to go, all of a sudden (after another 10 min wait) the manager and food came out. I refused and wanted my check since I still hadn't even received my drink yet.  The manager didn't even apologize for being late or anything just asked if we wanted our food or not. I'm like can I at least get my beer? Needless to say they suck! Unless your cool with waiting 1 hour for your food then this place might be for you.",

The croissant also came with a side of potatoes which was mouth watering. The potatoes had the perfect amount of garlic and crispiness to them. I lowkey wish they gave me more.The whole meal itself was really filling, and I was already full before I even made it halfway through.  I guess the only sad part about the meal was I couldn't finish it.. wayyy too filling for this tiny body. But I couldn't take it to-go with me either cause we didn't have time to go back to our hotel room, and you can't really bring food in with you to dayclub ya know?

The girls at the front are completely indifferent and it took 15 minutes to get seated on a Tuesday night.   Our meal was so salty filet mignon,  schnitzel,  mushrooms that we sent it all back and left without eating our dinner.  At over 20 minutes to get our main course it was inexcusable.   Our waitress explained that the sides are pre salted downstairs and that there was little chance a second try was worth it.",

    "text": "HEXX is a newer dining establishment on the strip that's open 24-7 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My first experience was decent, but a few things kept me from making this a four-star review. Here's the dealio...  HEXX is located in the front portion of Paris Hotel and Casino with a wraparound front and side patio that's great for people watching or taking in a view of the breathtaking Bellagio fountains. Since my husband and I were staying at Paris, we entered through the casino where there was a hostess stand, but no hostess. I hate that awkward feeling of wondering if you're meant to wait there or seat yourself. We decided to carry on and planned to ask the first restaurant employee we came across. We walked, and walked, and finally we were standing at the outside entrance on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another hostess stand and three hostesses. Just a suggestion, but you girls might want to spread out a bit to avoid this confusion.  Once we were seated on the patio, we were finally ready to enjoy our lunch. The patio does have table umbrellas and light misting to keep you cool. It felt perfect even though it topped 100 degrees. Then again, I'm a desert lovin' girl.   The menu had plenty of variety, all at your typical Vegas prices. My turkey sandwich served with fries was $16, but I suppose it was a \"gourmet\" price being that it was served with avocado on cranberry challah bread, right? It was still very tasty though and was a decent portion as well. It's rare that I have food envy over what my husband chooses. It's more often the other way around, but I guess I was off my game because I wanted to switch plates with him during our entire meal. What did he have that looked so appealing, you ask? Chicken and waffles. Not just any chicken and waffles, but chicken breast tenders and an apple cheddar waffle served with bourbon maple syrup. He gave me a bite of his $24 lunch entree after he caught me drooling over it more than once, and it confirmed my suspicion... I should've gotten THAT!   Our server, though a sweet girl, seemed a bit off. She over-poured my ice tea nearly missing my precious phone, and didn't seem too confident in her answers to the few questions we had.  I'd be willing to give HEXX another shot due to the fact that there are plenty of things on the menu that begged me to try them. Helloooo chocolate pancakes with caramel syrup... I'm talking to you! Give me a better experience next time, and I'll bump it up a star. Until then...",

    "text": "My first ever brunch in Vegas and I'll definitely come back. We had reservations for 11:30 and still waited half an hour- not a great start. When we were finally called, we were told by a grouchy hostess that only a patio table was available, even though we sat across from multiple empty indoor tables for the duration of our entire meal. Luckily as we were seated on the patio the chilly morning burned off into a gorgeous afternoon.   We dined under an amazing view of the Bellagio and Caesar's, and the pop of orange from the umbrellas made everything that much cheerier. For our table of four every dish was incredible. Eggs Benedict, Cinnamon Roll waffle (with a mound of cream on top), Margherita Pizza, and Ham and Cheese Croissant Sandwich. We all loved our food and marveled at my husband's cinnamon waffle until his last bite.   A large rowdy bachelorette party kept our nerves on edge as they would burst out in loud sing alongs to the music- but for a place with bottomless mimosas I guess that's going to happen once in a while!   Would be 5 stars for the food, interior design, location and beautiful view, just wishing the service was a bit better. Still an awesome experience overall.",

I ordered my burger medium expecting some pink in the middle, it was cooked through, dry and not hot, barely warm. Fries the same, only warm. My partners chicken and waffles were hot but the breast piece was over cooked, dry. The thigh piece was delicious. I loved the location but the service was spotty.

At first impression, Hexx is a beautiful place to have brunch-- you walk in, and you just feel the classy-boozy-brunch ambience. That feeling of, \"Hey, let's get a morning cocktail to nurse this slight Vegas hangover.\"  The staff is incredibly attentive, accommodating (had to move to another table to accommodate my ankle injury), and personable. Our waitress was super funny, and our host was very sweet. But the food-- meh. I'd say that if you're getting something sweet, go for it. But their actual meals were just dry and tasteless.   We ordered a mocha to start. Delicious. It was smooth, foamy, and not too rich. And then I got a bit too excited and ordered one of their dry-ice smoking cocktails -- the Elixir (most definitely did not give me life). It tasted and looked like an AMF. The worst is that I low-key was annoyed that this particular cocktail was recommended to me by the staff and now no one at the table wanted to drink it lol. There goes $36.  I'd have to say that the highlight of the meal was the Cinnaroll Waffle. The decadent cream cheese and cinnamon flavoring was amazing. I expected the chicken and waffles to be as great too, but it came out to be kinda dry and tasteless. So was my protein omelet-- the chicken was cardboard. And the corned beef hash? Not enough potatoes. And the salad? As DJ Esco would say, \"Too Much SAUCEEEE.\"  Bye.",

    "text": "My friend and her fiance came to Vegas for her birthday. Her fiance and I originally wanted to go to Sugar Factory but since Hexx took over and that option wasn't available we decided to try this place out. We ordered the Jungle Juice drink. It tastes similar to Malibu/Pineapple. It was really good. About 10 or so shots inside. We had the spinach artichoke dip, Loaded fries, Pepperoni pizza and calamari. The food was great. I personally loved the dip and fries. I would have given 5 stars but was disappointed to hear that they don't do anything for birthdays. I was offered a dessert menu and told they'd provide me with candles but I'd still have to pay full menu price. Considering how much $ we spent here I would have assumed they would at the very least speak to management and try to make some sort of gesture even at 1/2 price. Most places do something small for celebratory events. I really hope they consider this in the near future. We sat out on the patio and we got to see the Bellagio fountain show during our meal which made the atmosphere a lot more enjoyable. If you go here, be sure you're ready to spend $ as they are on the pricier side but overall good service and good food. Thanks",

    "text": "Hexx has such a fantastic atmosphere with the patio being right across from the Bellagio water show and underneath the Paris' Eiffel Tower but the food quality is two stars at best. I reserved a table for 8 for a friend's birthday party and the experience was disappointing. The drinks were probably the second best part of the visit next to the sights, the drinks were shareable and had 8-10 shots and a pretty presentation. I wasn't able to try one so I opted for a virgin strawberry mojito which was pretty good. We ordered a variety of food from the guacamole to pizza and everything was pretty bland. The burgers had stale buns, the pizza was way too greasy, the pasta was bland. I ordered the mushroom pappardelle and I shouldn't have let our server talk me into adding shrimp because I couldn't stomach any of it and even though I literally didn't take one bite of the shrimp, she didn't ask what the problem was or even apologize for talking me into something I knew I didn't want. Adding garlic bread to your pasta costs extra and wasn't worth it. At the end of our dinner they came out with a tiny piece of cake for our friend and had the candle sitting on the plate all by itself so naturally the candle blew out and fell over before reaching my friend and the server just said I'm sorry, worst presentation ever and ran off. It was lame to say the least. Then two tables over we see a beautiful birthday treat come out with three well lit candles so that was even more upsetting. We ordered another dessert, the warm cookie Sunday and it was awfully dry and too thick to be considered a cookie. More like a dry chocolate chip cake. Just awful. For a place known for sweets, the desserts couldn't have let me down more. I won't return to Hexx and I will not recommend it. Also, the cherry on top, I came home and food positioning commenced. The papardelle DID NOT sit well.",

We ordered the Hex burger, marguerites pizza, and Mac and cheese. Our waitress, Denise, never asked us how our food was. We wish she would have because the burger was so over-cooked and bone dry. The pizza was sub par and soggy. The only positives- the bacon on the burger was delicious and my drinks were never empty. Everything else was a let down. There's easily 999+ places we would have rather eaten at. Patrons, avoid The Hexx- you can do much better in Vegas, the Mecca of great food!!",

My pepperoni pizza arrived and crab cakes and she never showed up again.

It was served with home made pita and tortilla chips. I had chicken tortilla soup that was on the creamy side, great! Chunks of tender chicken & nice blend of spices. For my entree I had the scallops. OMG! Must order. They are huge and buttery and topped with I think pancetta. We complimented our meal with a wine flight which was really nice and included a cabernet, rose, port, and chardonnay. For desert we had chocolate cheesecake. Another amazing menu item! Decadent with oreo crust, peanut butter caramel sauce, topped with caramel popcorn. This is def a place to try! Sit on the patio and people watch !",

    "text": "Taking advantage of two visitors and a pair of holiday weekends to revisit several of 2017's best meals it was as a party of five that Brunch was enjoyed at HEXX Kitchen + Bar inside Paris Las Vegas, the city's best 24/7 Restaurant now a three-year tradition at Christmas and this year doubling as a 21st Birthday celebration for one guest at the table.   Always a Restaurant testing the limitations of its space and clientele, the appointment of Due Forni's Carlos Buscaglia to top Toque earlier this year ushering in the complete overhaul of a Dinner menu that now holds its own against any Restaurant of its ilk while surpassing many 'fine dining' spaces in terms of creativity, it was just past 11:00am on Sunday morning that hostesses led patrons to a lengthy indoor banquet reserved earlier that week, a pleasant young woman stopping by within moments to take drink orders of Coffee for most, plus one Potion for the guest of honor.   Once again featuring shockingly efficient service for a place that does so much volume, Mr. Stotland keeping a watchful eye over the expansive space and coordination of servers with bussers seamlessly filling drinks and clearing plates without ever feeling late or intrusive, it was in three courses that Brunch was consumed beginning with HEXX's famous Fruit Plate, the collection this time highlighted by Papaya and Pineapple best dipped in Coconut Whip while the Dragon Fruit was far sweeter than usual, both on the plate and as incorporated into the \"Magick Dragon\" that billowed smoke upon service with a flavor not dissimilar to the Red Icee's served at the movie theater.  Investing in both old and new favorites throughout a two-hour meal, the portions seemingly larger than past visits as relates to both sweets and savories, it was with many focused on the fluffy Brioche Sticky Bun that regulars reveled in the return of Chef Matt Piekarski's Carrot Cake Pancakes, the item now back on the Brunch Menu every bit as good as memory serves with lightly spiced Batter fluffy and moist beneath a mound of Cream Cheese Frosting.  Sharing all plates family-style, the carbohydrate-heavy first course taking its toll on lighter appetites despite several plates to follow, it was to wide eyes that servers next delivered HEXX's Benny replacing English Muffins with cheesy Potatoes alongside a stacked Breakfast Croissant and Chilaquiles with a lot of spice and several still-crisp Tortilla Chips, plus an oversized order of the typically Dinner-only fried Broccolini.  Admittedly a lot of Food, the Parmesan Potatoes particularly dangerous when accounting for portion and likelihood of going back for seconds, it was after a brief respite with one guest already waving the white flag that four all-new Desserts were delivered, Pastry Chef Mirada proving a worthy successor to Carol Garcia with thick Pumpkin Brulee that eats like Pot de Creme with a caramelized top plus a boozy Shake served next creamy confetti Cheesecake and equally rich Marshmallow Semifreddo beneath crumbled Graham Crackers and Fudge made from HEXX's bean-to-bar Chocolate.  Not quite finished yet, a tableside Tiramisu still in-process as the last drops of Amaretto trickled through Coffee Beans to Almond Cake below, it was by way of advanced order that Brunch finished with a custom White Cake filled with Strawberries and Cream, @cakegirl702 living up to her name in terms of both design and taste even though most were too full to enjoy it until later.",

The guacamole was a little bland but I enjoyed the pork rinds that came with it. The charcuterie board was amazing. Fresh baked pretzel, with meats and cheeses alongside stone ground mustard was awesome. The bun served with our burger was made with white chocolate. Which sounds weird but it was really really good as well. The only thing that offset all this was the service. It was a little busy on the patio, and the server forgot about us a couple times.",

Bloody Mary was too spicy even though I ordered it with just a little spice, but the flavor and strips of bacon made up for it. Hubs had chiliquilles and enjoyed it.

The funny thing is we were really looking forward to breakfast here again and came at the exact same time as before but they were not serving breakfast anymore. we must of just missed it.  We had to get the purple haze drink again and at $38.00 it did not disappoint. Again this may seem like a lot of money but it is enough for 2-3 people so it is well worth it and gathers attention :)  I had the prime beef dip and my wife had the turkey club. Both were very good. Fries were excellent. You can also taste the quality of food.   A little pricey for lunch but it's Las Vegas and has a beautiful view if you sit outside. We recommend you try this place at least once :)",

The beats were going and the wait staff were all so friendly as we walked in.   Ok the food.....We started off with the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer - OMG! It was so to die for! I also had a turkey bacon sandwich w/ fries. It was good. Not over the top amazing, but good. My friend loved her bottomless mimosas. In fact, the whole restaurant did. lol They were always close by to refill, so everyone loved that. Lots of \"happy\" people in our section.  But, the service, can I say was out of this world! We had Tracy as our server and man, she seriously is the best. She was so friendly, attentive, gave good recommendations and full of laughs. She had our whole section cheering her name. No seriously we chanted it all afternoon long. Lol Every employee who passed by our table always kept us laughing & smiling the whole time we were there. We seriously sang to hits from Aaliyah, Backstreet Boys & more.  I'll be back in Vegas 2 more times in the next 7 weeks and yeah, I'll definitely be stopping in again and again. Thanks for a fun Sunday afternoon, guys!   PS Tracy deserves a raise! I'm just sayin'!",

But when it comes to service with \"Ari\" the so called manager HORRIBLE. He is not OK with service animals. Basically discrimination with the way he looks at you and your Animal. I was here last night and back today. Had a great time last night, great food. But Mr Ari def made today's experience horrible.",

You can sit inside where it is cool and enjoy a stylish atmosphere or sit outside and watch people as they drunkenly pass by while singing songs and laughing.  We had a party of 6 and sat outside.  The drinks were phenomenal and the food was also equally outstanding.  What really made them stand out was that they knew we were celebrating anniversaries, birthdays and an engagement so they brought over cupcakes with candles in them.  Nice touch. Our waitress was very kind and always made sure we had everything we needed and quickly. Reservations were made easily and we were seated very quickly.  If you are looking for something to fill you up, while you people watch, this is the place to go.",

They had shredded carrots cooked in and came with a Cream cheese topping and a special kind of syrup! My taste buds were having a dance partyyyyyyy! I didn't use much of the syrup. It wasn't  needed. The pancakes were huge and came in a stack of four! (Totally Sharable)! The service could of been better but they were busy and he was nice just overwhelmed. The food totally made up for that.

We were seated on the patio right by the rail so we could watch all the free entertainment of people watching vegas has to offer. The food was delicious and the restaurant was very clean and very elegant without being overdone or making you feel unwelcome wearing you shorts in the vegas heat!  The wait staff was on it! Normally when you get unlimited mimosa's they are either watered down or you can never find your waiter to get a refill. Not the case here, the glass would hardly even hit bottom before someone was refilling it. The mix was great too, not just all orange juice like some places. We did have an issue with my Bloody Mary not coming out but they were prompt to fix it and make good on it.  My favorite thing was our waitress Tracee. She was truly amazing. If you have read some of my reviews I always try and point wait staff that do an exceptional job because no matter how good the food is your waiter or waitress can make or break a visit. She was fantastic, funny, well educated and just made us all feel like we were regulars on our fist visit.  I made it a point to save the receipt just so I have her name.  I will request her on my next visit and be happy to wait the whole 30min if I had to just to sit in her section! Thank you Tracee you truly made our visit special and memorable.  Also, side note, she is not afraid to shoo away the panhandlers trying to sell bead or whatnot over the rail! Haha!",

Cooked to our exact preferences. Delicious.  The seasoning wasn't overwhelming.  We ordered two sides,  brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes.  Oh man,  they were divine.  We also ordered dessert. The Blueberry Corn Crisp. Unique - it was really good!  My favorite thing was sitting on the patio.  Watching the water show.  And we weren't rushed.  We spent almost 2 hours there.  It rejuvenated us.  Courteous staff.  I recommend the patio seating if possible.",

We got a nice spot from where we could see the Bellagio fountain every 15 minutes.  Our server Jessica was super cool and was very nice to us. We wanted to try one of the Hexx Potions since it looked very interesting and asked her to suggest something from that list. She suggested us the Purple Haze and that was absolutely amazing!! The whole experience from the way she poured the drink into the pitcher to the point we tasted it was memorable(See video). We couldn't finish the drink but in Las Vegas, it is okay to carry alcohol in a to-go glass and that is exactly what we did. The Desert Smash from the Speciality Cocktails was nice too.  In the food, we had the Baked Spinach dip with bagel chips. The dip was very creamy and yummy. Bagel chips were something different and were nice and crisp and were a perfect accompaniment to the dip. Gnocchi Pomodoro was for my husband and he enjoyed it with additions of more veggies which cost 2 bucks/serving. I had a Halibut which came alongside tomato risotto, lime coconut broth & herb salad. The risotto and the broth were so yummy that I kept wanting more. The fish was poached beautifully to perfection! Absolutely delicious. To end our dinner which rather turned into a feast at this point, we had a Red Velvet Cake which was such a beautiful sight and super classy. It was just the perfect quantity for two.  Rating the following out of 5:  AMBIANCE - 5 Loved the ambiance. Quiet and beautiful.   FOOD- 5 Everything deserves a 5!!  CUSTOMER SERVICE - 5 Jessica was amazing!! :)  WAIT TIME - 5 No wait time.  HYGIENE - 5  PARKING -  We walked down from our hotel. Parking in Vegas, especially the strip is a bit cumbersome so it is better to take Uber/Lyft.  Also, this restaurant is 24/7 which is awesome!",

Yes, the food was good however being in Vegas and all, it's pricey.  My friends ordered the chicken sandwich and I got the turkey club which was actually too big for most people's mouths...I had to remove the inner piece of bread.  I was debating getting chicken & waffles but I ended up with the sandwich paired with the white sangria which was delicious!  I asked our server for a recommendation, she gave us the white.  Good location...good service.

The waiter asked if we would like some garlic bread.  The bread was also good, but it was charged separately, which we didn't know.    For dessert, we shared a brownie and ice cream, which wasn't on the menu.  The brownie was delicious and it was complemented nicely with the coffee ice cream.

I give 2 stars because the service was nice and the \"fried mozzarella\" was yummy. We were just so disappointed that all we could do was laugh at the money we wasted on the worst tiramisu I've ever had. This is not classic tiramisu at all, this is another Vegas restaurant overcharging in attempts to be different. You're better off walking down to Cheesecake Factory for a nice dessert.",

We were ushered in like royalty into the back kitchen where they proceeded to show us the entire process of how they make chocolate! We got to ask questions and film everything and taste the differences. It was incredible! Then were were escorted out to their balcony outside which is under the Eiffel Tower with a view of the Bellagio Fountains to try a few AMAZING desserts.   We had the chef bring out the following:  E S P R E SS O TO R T E tanzania chocolate, espresso foam, cookie crumble C H O CO L AT E P U D D I N G tanzania chocolate, cocoa nib infused cream, banana bread crumble  There was one fore that i'm forgetting... but i don't think you can go wrong!",

He was very polite and apologized for the wait and took his time to explain/suggest everything.  He kept running back and forth to check in on us.  I appreciate that because even though I understand you are busy, standards should be met.  I could see he was working hard.  He and Abram took good care of us under the circumstances.  The food was great too.  I ordered the chilaquiles and my husband ordered the steak and eggs.  We both enjoyed our meals very much.  Portion was good as well.  Overall this place was great.  I don't really love the price but...it's Vegas, it's expected.  :)",

We got the salmon, cauliflower and the hexx salad. Any who the busser was very attentive he always cleared out our table and was the one who ended up getting the rest of our drink order.   It definitely wasn't busy so there is no reason for this.   Ps: it would have also been nice if they would have offered us a cocktAil or dessert menu.",

The cappuccinos and hot chocolate are both very tasty.   I shared the apple cinnamon pancakes and protein omelet with my sister. Both tasted great and the dishes were HUGE. So so much food, we couldn't finish it all. My boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles which were amazing! I'd order that next time!! All dishes were very good and very filling!   The service at Hexx was exceptional - Tracee was the BEST waitress we've had on our whole Las Vegas trip! It was my boyfriend's birthday and she brought out his chicken and waffles with candles and got the entire restaurant singing happy birthday, cheering and celebrating with us! It was so special and fun!!   Overall, one of the better restaurant experiences in Vegas.",

Or maybe you have too much pride and skip eating chocolate because you're too concerned about your figure... Or if you bypass the chocolate, and as a result you get angry and it invokes your wrath... Or if you decide to eat chocolate, but eat too much and people think you're greedy...  ...Ok, well I guess you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't, but hey, it's Vegas so go indulge at Hexx!  We were lured in with the promise of a build-your-own ice cream sandwich, but before we could partake in that very serious business we were sidetracked by a chocolate tasting. That's right, we sat down at a bar and sampled several bits of chocolate and real hot coccoa for free! Each bit was better than the last, and when I announced my favorite, they hit me with a sample of that kind of chocolate made into hot chocolate. It was awesome. Moreover, we watched the staff hand pick coccoa beans for quality control while we ate all that chocolate.  We made an ice cream sandwich made out of (1) peanut butter and Reese Pieces cookie, (1) snicker doodle cookie and stracciatella ice cream. It seemed to make sense at the time and it certainly satisfied.  Two thumbs up!",

Well, mostly for one specific menu item: the chicken and waffles, available for breakfast and dinner (!), are very probably the best I have ever had. The waffle is.golden and perfect, the chicken is fried but not so heavily breaded that it's more greasy skin than chicken. It all goes together perfectly into my favorite food for any time of day.   Well, that's the upside. The chicken and waffles are perfect. Get them. Now for the downside: like most strip restaurants, Hexx is definitely too expensive for what it is. It is a pretty nicely decorated and kept restaurant right off the Paris and with Las Vegas Blvd frontage, but for the price I'd expect good service, but the service at Hexx always seems a little scattered and disorganized. I mean the classic two people trying to take your drink order and then the waiter not being sure they put in your food order right.",

I wanted to try the crab cakes but was too full i highly recommend it though. My cousin got the waffles and said it was light and airy. Thomas H was out waiter and he was beyond attentive got us everything told us about the menu and told us his favorite things on it. He was superb and by far the best waiter ive met on this trip. I hope management recognizes him for it!  Atmosphere great modern and cool vibe! Great for brunch! And music is great",

The view and atmosphere were great, as well as the food. My niece is vegan and although the menu didn't have vegan options,our server went above and beyond to explain the vegan options that were available. The service was fantastic, Raphael was funny and knowledgeable in regards to the menu.. top notch service! Management had a strong presence on the floor, being in the service industry myself I really appreciated that. Allison and Andrew were very helpful and attentive. Overall, we had an awesome time and we will be back.",

You can not beat the great view of the fountains (and the people watching - just wait for a patio table, it is worth it). Highly suggest this for brunch, but a late night bite is also great (their charcuterie plate is top notch).  The ambience inside is also pretty good, but they could turn the music down a little so you can actually have conversations at your table without having to almost yell at each other.  This time around there was a True shining star, which is why I am finally writing a review for this spot... Raphael. ASK FOR HIM; you will not be sorry! What an AWESOME waiter; fun, friendly, jovial, prompt, quality-driven and all-around just good at his job.",

Great view, amazing food and service that was attentive to all our needs.  Michael Main, the GM, went out of this way to make this a special night for our family.  The wait staff was attentive and perfectly timed the delivery of the appetizers and food.  On a night that was 105 degrees, the waiters made sure our water glasses were always filled.  As for the food...the fennel sausage pizza was amazing as was the Margherita pizza.  The Chicken and Waffles was the best my son has ever had (and he has had that dish many times) and the two pasta dishes were magnificent.  There are a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, but is a MUST visit restaurant.  By the way, the Banana Sundae is a must. Get multiple spoons if you must, but this is Vegas, so treat yourself to a great dessert.",

The anti-pasto on the other hand for the same price was enough to split wi th 6 people as a generous side. I did not eat the simple salad - cheese was called snow white cheddar and it tasted like goat... ugh...  Service was strange. We had a party of 16 and 6 people's food came out over a half hour before the rest. Jambalaya, 27 bucks. The two ladies who ordered it could not eat more than a third due to the spice. Burger looked great but at 20 bucks you had to pay extra for fries. Marguerita Pizza ok. Wish it was fresh basil instead of pesto drizzle but I understand the twist.  I didn't care for it all in all. Service a bit funny - never had my water glass so well attended in my life to the point of annoyance.  Waiter brought out dessert forks for all so we thought there was comp dessert as it was a wedding reception and then he brought out one scoop of icecream and a brownie  then told the bride and groom they could pass it around the table... to 16 people... oy vey awkward. So overpriced.",

    "text": "We saw $20 bottomless mimosas on the street in front of the restaurant, so we decided to try it out. We came in 10 minutes after the breakfast and mimosa special had ended, but they let us order the mimosas anyway, which was great, but then it all went downhill. The restaurant appeared higher class, but looks can be deceiving. Our server did not get to us for 10 minutes, even though they weren't busy. We ordered the mimosas and food together since we had ample time to decide, and our server was very friendly, just extremely slow. Each mimosa took at least 15 minutes, and when the food came out, one dish was forgotten, and we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my friend's order. The turkey club was good and a large serving, but the pasta dishes (pappardelle) were lacking flavor (hamburger helper has more). Aside from the food, I am a young woman with tattoos, but that doesn't make me a lower priority customer. The manager went around to every table except ours, for reasons why, I know not. Before ordering, I noticed they charged a 3.5% concession fee, which I had not encountered before. I asked our server, upon which she replied that she was new, so the manager would come over to explain. I had tried to flag him down before, but he seemed to avoid walking by our table. He finally came over, upon which I inquired about the fee (which was in small fine print in the menu, and on the receipt was labeled \"cnf\"). I wonder if only a few people had noticed this before, but when I asked, he responded that it was a fee associated as their position as a tenant in the casino as opposed to a free standing business.  I replied, \"So, rent?\" He curtly said \"oh, um, yes,\" as he walked away. I wasn't allowed any follow up questions or comments before he fled, nor did he ask how our experience was at any point. Server was nice and new, so she was fine, I understand, I'm in the service industry, but the manager was incompetent, unprofessional, and completely lacked friendly people skills. Food was overpriced and bland. Will not return.",

Our servers name was Jen and by far the best server I've had while dining on the strip. she was so educated on all the questions we had about the menu she told us to get the Hexx potion because it's great for sharing so we got the passion fruit margarita and ohemmgeee it was to die for!! I recommend it to everyone, it tasted delicious and so awesome to see the presentation on it as well. After getting our drink we ordered a quick snack. We got the crab cakes which were amazing as well we sat on the patio which overlooks the bellagio fountains even tho the fountains weren't running at the time it was still a great view to people watch. As we were finishing up Juan the manager stopped by and asked how our experience was going and gave us great ideas about sights to go see while in town he was so radiant and professional but making us feel like friends. I recommend this place to everyone! Thank you again Juan and Jen!",

    "text": "HEXX is located in the front of Paris Hotel and Casino. It's open 24 hours, and that includes the bar and alcohol! They have entrances both on the Strip, and from inside the Paris casino. We were staying at the Paris, so stumbled onto this place when we saw the entrance from inside the casino, and glad that we did. We sat inside at the bar, and our bartender (Scott) was great!! We picked a couple things off of the menu, and they were both great. We really liked the selections to choose from. We got the smothered fries (awesome!), shrimp cocktail, soft pretzels with an amazing cheese dip, beef tartare. Everything was excellent. Prices seemed reasonable (as Vegas goes anyway). We planned on going back a couple days later, but that never happened. But we would return here anytime. Oh, and they are making their own chocolate in their candy store (attached to the restaurant via the street entrance). Great exotic chocolates to try at their \"chocolate bar\" with samples so you know which one you like. Plus a ton of other candies. So whether you stay at Paris or Planet Hollywood, which is close next door, stop in for a drink and food.",

I put my name in with my whole group and was told I would receive a text and must arrive within 10 minutes. The staff was already very curt demanding to count off the members of my party before I could put my name in. I received a text at 12:44 and arrived at the restaurant front desk at 12:53 with my party just behind me. The hostess, who's name I wish I got but was an older woman with dark hair, barely acknowledged me and when I inquired about my reservation stayed I would have to go to the bottom of the list for not arriving in 10 minutes, after showing her my phone that documented I received the text 9 minutes ago, she stated that she was sure she sent it 15 minutes ago. This is the equivalent of making up a rule that you can only drive 5 mph on a road and then pulling someone over for going 4 mph. If you are going to have your own insane rules at least follow them. I understand it is on a busy location in Vegas but maybe stop and think about what you are trying to do (i.e. Providing and experience for people) as opposed to trying to churn people through your restaurant.",

The biggest change comes to the drink menu, where the goblets with dry ice are no longer available. They've been replaced by giant martinis though and they still pack quite the punch-definitely good enough for 2 people. The food was still great-I got the burger on the white chocolate brioche which was AMAZING. Buffalo chicken croquettes were pretty good too, as well as the pasta my girlfriend ordered. Service was top notch-I cannot think of one complaint. Fast and friendly from being seated to paying our check and they gave me half off the beer I ordered because the one I originally wanted was out. Only knock on this place is that it's a little overpriced for what it is. Overall if you're looking for some tasty, imaginative American food this is the place to go. Just remember-no more goblets with the dry ice! It seemed like everyone came in confused that they were no longer available.",

We then had to remind someone to get our waiter so we could order after we had been waiting 15 minutes.  Another 10 minutes we get our drinks - glass of wine and a beer.  Another 25 minutes still no food.  We had ordered the Wagyu steaks ($60 steaks) - one fillet and one ribeye - both cooked medium rare with some side veggies.  We got the waiter's attention asked him about the food and told him we had a theatre show to make.  He said he would check.  Still no food.  Finally the steaks arrive at 9pm - 75 minutes after we arrived at the restaurant - all that for medium rare steaks.    The food was good - steaks were decent and veggies were tasty.  We didn't have enough time to finish the food and had to leave some of the meal - also no hope of dessert, we never even finished our meal.  We had to track down the waiter to get the check.  We finally got out of the restaurant but missed the first 10 minutes of our theatre show.  We complained to the manager while we waited on the check but he didn't do anything.  This was really poor performance and I will probably never go back to this restaurant again.  Also the fact that they did nothing to correct the problem makes me feel obligated to write this review and warn others - when things go wrong, restaurants need to fix it.",

    "text": "Stopped in for some two for one drinks (courtesy of MyVegas Slots) and snacks to check out the place that was once The Sugar Factory Bar. All was good in my opinion and besides decor, an outside patio and a different cocktail menu...there were no other noticeable changes from the last time I stepped into this building.  Ordered some spinach artichoke dip, a Barrel-Aged Chocolate Manhattan and a Mandarin Mule. The dip brought nothing new to the table in terms of flavor from other spinach artichoke dips I've had but was good nonetheless.   The Barrel-Aged Chocolate Manhattan is where the party was. This cocktail was awesome! The chocolate infused Bourbon was strong and gave a nice aroma of chocolate and a hint of chocolate flavor. I'm not sure what role the sweet Vermouth might have played in this cocktail besides its inclusion of more alcohol. The more the better. This wasn't a drink you'd take back fast and move on. This was to be enjoyed slowly and I most definitely enjoyed it with every sip. The Manderin Mule was the opposite as it was good but a drink I consumed faster. This was on the more tangier and sweet side with a ginger flavor.   There was hungry friends back at the hotel so we ordered a custom topping pizza to go. A pepperoni, jalapeno and mushroom pizza that was delicious. There was also the Classic burger ordered by a friend who said it was delicious as well. I didn't get to try it for myself but this friend hasn't steered me wrong with good food so I'll take his word for it.   A pizza and that Manhattan is most definitely on my list to be ordered again at Hexx. I'll be making my way through the cocktail menu for others to try but you better believe the Barrel-Aged Chocolate Manhattan is being ordered right by its side or free if Myvegas Slots Loyalty Points are used again.

I ordered the pancakes and the syrup was infused with vanilla that gave them an amazing flavor! They offered healthy menu options and also some that were more indulgent like the cinnamon roll waffles! Great spot for a birthday brunch or bachelorette!",

Our server walked us through the menu and provided us his recommendations.   Of course because it was brunch we had to get the bottomless mimosas. They were divine and just enough kick for that last day in Vegas buzz.   All in all one of the best places we ate it while in Vegas.

The waiter greeted us and they offered three types of water: Pellegrino, Fiji and tap. The water show in Vegas goes on right a crossed from the outside dinning. Nice entertainment while you wait for your meal.   We order the gravy and fries, aka poutine, chicken and waffles and I ordered the shrimp scampi.   You have to wait for your food, so don't be in a rush. It's upper class and the average meal is $25.00 bucks, apps around $10.00   The people next to us got a really cool looking drink. Bubbling blue monstrosity.   The fries came out quickly and my brother said they were really good. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The gravy was hot and toasty and the curd were stringy. The ranch is defiantly made in house and vey creamy but it's a little more sour than your average ranch, sour cream based.   The scampi was very good, the sauce wasn't too thick and very buttery. The chili was a nice note. And bread was my favorite part soft and buttery nicely toasted.   The chicken and waffles my brother said it was juicy, the breeding could have been a little crispier, the pickles/onion slaw were really good and the waffle was crisp and pretty standard Belgium waffle, real maple syrup. The bite all together was quite delicious.  Definitely a place to try on the strip.",

I get very annoyed when restaurants stop serving breakfast after 10 am-- especially in places like Las Vegas where you're usually up pretty late and then sleep in. Thankfully Hexx had it all day so we chose to eat there one day when we slept in some -- and glad we did.   The location is great -- next time I'll sit outside so I can have an across-the-street view of the Bellagio Fountain show. The price is pretty standard for Vegas -- about $20/person.  I had this meat omelette that was amazing and quite filling. Their coffee was delicious also. Great Ambiance and there's an even a candy store attached if you need a little something afterwards",

Braised Short ribs - my mouth is watering just thinking about them.  The meat just fell off the bone.  Pairing of the potatoes and Brussels sprouts were perfect.  AND the Prime Rib......oh the prime rib.  Cooked to perfection, lots of red (the way we asked), didn't have to send it back like you do most places because most places over cook.  The meat just melted in our mouths. There's a lot more I need to go back and try.  I saw drunk that was served out of a large swan.  It's on my to do list.",

My wife said her Chicken BLT Sandwich was good.    I guess if they didn't try to screw us over with the poor table I might have given a 3, or maybe not.  I really did not like my dish.",

Ordered drinks and fairly soon after that, ordered food. Forty five minutes before the food came. We'd had three refills of bottomless mimosas and no food. Finally asked where our food was and was told it'd be 5-10 more minutes, then it came right out, and it was cold. One person had a warm plate, the rest, room temperature at best. Our food had clearly been sitting out for awhile. No apologies. One member sent hers back because it was so salty she couldn't eat it. Her replacement meal came out quickly and I enjoyed what she shared with me which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1.",

Our server was Sara who was very pretentious especially when we presented our groupon! Not sure if it was the groupon or our partie's color? Micheal (Bolton cause he was singing a micheal Bolton song) was another server (we don't know his name) and he was very kind to his tables we would have wanted him. It was 4 pm and te place was empty so it's not like the tables were all filled and Sara couldn't get to us. She didn't even have the audacity to further come by our table to check on us, or give us napkins... she had the guy who filled up our glasses come and ask us if we wanted dessert. I told her from the beginning of our meal that it was a birthday but I guess that's why we didnt get a napkin. She was attentive to other tables just not ours after we got the expensive good wine she never came back...maybe we looked like the help to her or maybe the groupon. Anyway our filet mignon and steak, and calamari was average but the cesear and salad was very delicious hence the 3 stars but as for belittling your guests you get zero. Fyi...we also tipped very well but it should have gone to Micheal and the guy who gave us water...we saw Micheal (bolton) more and even heard him sing great voice...nice job!",

The steak was very underwhelming. It tasted like your average Denny's/Norms type of steak. It had no flavor, was not cooked to my liking, and it was very chewy. The highlight of the meal were the potatoes. They had a good crunch and flavor to them. The ambiance was great. I sat outside and felt a nice breeze while I people watched. The timing of them bringing out my meal took a little long, but I was with a group of ten. The service was alright. I had to wait a bit until I would be served some water. Overall, you're paying to eat on the strip. I would not come back unless I came here for a birthday and was forced.",

The inside was what really drew us in, the restaurant was so cute and they had these little sections on the side that consisted of booth/lounge seating with pillows and curtains around the area that gave the illusion of a private eating, which made us excited to sit back and enjoy the bottomless mimosas we were about to order. As we waited for a server to help us out we were being missed due to the area not being in sight. We asked the host/bar a few times for help, but no-one seemed to come and take our order. The server Sean noticed us and how we had not been attended to, he took on our table and turned our experience completely upside down! The food was amazing and our mimosas were always filled, but what made the overall expierence even better, was the service provided by Sean and the help of Patrick. Sean was very welcoming, honest, friendly, and likable. We were in such awe of how great his customer service was, we believed he was too over qualified for the job but he was that good! If you decide to eat here the food is tasteful, but Sean's service is was made the dining an exceptional one!",

The ambiance of the place is definitely LUSH! I enjoyed that for sure. Now onto the food.. After looking at the previous customer's pictures they ordered on yelp I really saw nothing appealing other than the deserts and things that they normally serve during breakfast. I ended up going with the $20 Hexx burger. It was good.. Worth $20? No... The  $28 jambalaya was good very spicy, my bf liked it so that's all that mattered. Service was just okay.. Nothing that was over the top or exceptionally great. Our waitress was.. Different... I have to check out the breakfast before I completely rule out never returning. Oh and the Bellagio water show that goes on across the street is awesome so make it a priority to get some dining on the patio! Remember most of the high price you are paying is for the location so you may as well enjoy it fully with the scenery right?",

The menu looked different too, but they still have the candy shop.    Sat here for 6 hours Saturday morning with a huge group of hung over friends.  We probably wouldn't have stayed so long, but they put us on a couch type booth with pillows and it was SO comfortable.    Portions are HUGE.  Like to big for one person.    The all you can drink Mimosa's are great.    Service was little bit slow, but then again we were there for six hours.....all in all.  I would come here again.",

    "text": "It's hard to find a decent place to eat on the strip - I struggle to find a place that's proportionately priced to the quality. You mostly pay exorbitant prices for average food in a fancy setting or exorbitant prices for average food in an average setting. Either way, tastebuds and wallet are not in sync. Except for Hexx!!  I saw Hexx from across the strip and suggested we check it out for lunch instead of one of the mainstream (and not very good) chain restaurants we were passing. Checked out the menu and were able to grab seats at the bar in time for happy hour pricing on food and drinks - it was great! We split the spinach artichoke dip (very tasty) and I got the tomato and burrata bruschetta. I don't see the bruschetta listed on their menu online, so I hope it's still available - it was delicious! And both appetizers were especially generous in portion, for pretty reasonable prices (and not just Vegas-reasonable, I mean actual reasonable). It was a really perfect lunch (kind of lunch turned linner) stop for us, and I highly recommend it. I was so impressed with the quality, quantity, and price point of the food I actually sought out the manager and complimented/thanked him for running such a great find - and right on the strip!  Some would say it was by chance we landed here, others might say fate...my friend was obsessed with going to the \"candy restaurant, where they serve candy for dinner!\" (which we all immediately shut down) but, as it turns out, that very same restaurant is Hexx. They have an attached candy shop and apparently went through a revamp a year or so ago - so the rumor of a candy restaurant had been True (or at least as True as rumors tend to be) but we all also enjoyed a great meal.",

The front desk was super accommodating, I had made a reservation through open table and walked in 5 min late and was told my reservation didn't exist. I showed them my reservation on my phone, turns out another group had taken my reservation! I was shocked! But the hostess had our back and seated us right away. We ordered our own food each; I got the farm fresh eggs over easy with sausages. It was a great brunch. My friends had gotten the chicken and waffles which looked amazing and we had gotten a stack of pancakes to share. Drinks were great too! They make a good spicy Bloody Mary! Definitely somewhere I'll return to when I'm in Vegas!",

What was the bride to be craving...bottomless mimosas lol. So we found this place where you can drink unlimited bottomless mimosas for 2 hours. 3 of the 5 girls chose this option and were very happy!  Definitely check out this place since it had an open bright restaurant style where you can watch the Bellagio Fountains dance, you know where they filmed 'Oceans 11' lol.   I got the burger which was ok, I wish they had a brioche bun. I did love the doubled cooked potatoes! So good. The cinnamon roll to share was on point for flavor.   Overall check it out yet try to make reservations if you're going during the prime time weekends.",

We loved it so much at brunch we went back for dinner the same day! Both times we sat on patio which had amazing view of Bellagio fountains. The food was delicious and the servings are huge so SHARE if you can. At brunch we had the Hexx cauldron drink which came served in a fancy disco ball. It was $40 which I thought was a little pricey until it arrived. We got SO many drinks out of it! And it tasted amazing. There were 4 people in our group and everyone loved their food at both meals. Definitely recommend. Also we sat outside and even in the evening in 105 degree heat it did not really feel hot outside. Definitely go!",

    "text": "My friend Jamie and I enjoyed an amazing Sunday brunch at Hexx for a very nice price thanks to Groupon. We had reservations for 10:30, and we were seated at a table right in the border of the patio but technically inside, with a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains across the street.   We started out with some iced coffee and the Fresh Fruit Plate ($14). The papaya tasted a little off but otherwise this was wonderful. A large serving of numerous different fruits as well as a few small muffins.   We were going to split a pizza next but they were already out (at 11am!) so we decided to share the Surf and Turf Sliders ($22) instead. These were heavy on the short rib and a little light on the lobster, which was mixed with with the aioli slaw. I expected more lobster so I don't think this is a dish I would order again.  We also shared the Hexx Benedict ($16) which includes delicious scalloped potatoes rather than the typical English muffin. Perfectly poached egg, not too heavy on the hollandaise, and the asparagus was a nice addition.   We ended up with the Twisted Sticky Bun ($8) which was the star of the day in my opinion, especially for the price. Listed as a starter, it is super sweet and made the perfect shared dessert. A large, gooey bun with caramel drizzle, decadent cream cheese frosting and pecans. A must get.   If I had any complaints it would be that service was a bit slow, but it was a rather busy Sunday morning and our server was very friendly.   Note: the current menu was slightly different than the menu online,  instead of a lobster roll they have a scallop roll as of September 2018.  Yelp Reviews 2018 37/100",

She found a $50 Groupon for this spot, so we decided to check it out one Sunday for brunch. She did make reservations so we were seated right away. Not sure if they are recommended, but it was pretty full inside the restaurant.   We were seated at the perfect table that was half inside and half outside. We had a good spot for people watching, as well as a sweet view of the Bellagio fountains. Temperature wise, it wasn't too hot or too cold, it was just right.   We orderd: Iced coffees Fresh fruit plate  Sticky bun  Surf n turf sliders  Hexx Benedict  We originally ordered a pizza but were told shortly after we ordered they were out. A little disappointing, but we decided to try the sliders instead. The sliders were really good! The meat was a yummy short rib and came topped with lobster slaw. The combo worked well together! The fresh fruit plate was almost too pretty to eat. It had a bunch of yummy fruits including papaya, and little mini muffins! The hexx benedict was amazing. You can't really go wrong with a benedict, but this one was even better because instead of bread they used au gratin potatoes as the base. So yum! We saved the sticky bun for last and it was out of this world good. Besides being huge, it was served hot with warm cream cheese icing and candied pecans. It was the best sticky bun I've ever had.   So after the groupon the balance was still almost $40 with tax and tip. Not a cheap brunch at all, but it was so good I can't complain. I would definitely come back for brunch and also they have this huge bloody mary with king crab legs in them. I'd come back for that alone! On our way out we passed by Shaquille O' Neal who was eating lunch there, and he was making faces at my son. We ended up getting a pic with him and he was super cool! That's one thing I love about eating on the strip, you never know who you will run into!!",

    "text": "HEXX was the first Vegas foodie destination that my friend and I experienced on this trip. I made a reservation a couple of days in advance for a table for 2 at 10:30 a.m. After reading about how busy this place gets on Sunday, I was glad we did. We entered through the casino and received assistance in locating the hostess who was located near the front main entrance off the strip. The casino entrance looks legit but the official entrance is actually from the exterior.   This restaurant is HUGE! There are several rooms, each with its own unique feel - some airy and sunlit - others more dim, ensuring a more intimate mood. With a plethora of seating options inside, and a highly sought patio-arrangement, HEXX is Modernly decorated, ultra trendy, and THE hotspot for Sunday brunch. 'Nuff said about the venue itself...on to the rest: The reason you are spending money!   SERVICE: 4/5 Stars Our server was friendly and helpful enough, but she managed to disappear for upwards of 15 minutes toward the end of our meal experience. I was desperate for one last mimosa and my friend just wanted to obtain our check - so we had to ask a nearby busser to come to our rescue.  BRUNCH FOOD: 5/5 Stars YES TO ALL THINGS FOOD.  We were sold on the Carrot Cake pancakes after seeing the pictures on Yelp. Our Carrot Cake pancakes didn't quite resemble the modelesque photos, as they seemed to be missing some of the topping ingredients...either way, the pancakes were LEGIT. You could literally see the shredded carrots on the bottom of each pancake. Basically if you want dessert for breakfast, this dish is for you. We shared them and could barely finish the plate.   Steak and Eggs - I ordered my New York Strip medium rare, eggs scrambled. Just do it and don't look back. This dish is also accompanied by yummy skillet potatoes and a fluffy English muffin.  My friend had the Farm Fresh Eggs and she reports that this dish was just what the doctor ordered. She ordered her eggs cooked over-medium and that they were cooked perfectly - a hard task to achieve apparently. And the bacon was perfectly crispy...YES!  BRUNCH BEVERAGES: 3/5 I had better mimosas when I gambled at Planet Hollywood. For $23 per person, you can add bottomless mimosas to your meal, or you can just skip the meal and pay the $23 for unlimited mimosas. They come pre-mixed with O.J.  Meaning, each glass consists mostly of OJ, which you have to guzzle through in order to the next one.   They do not have any other flavors, but when I inquired about changing up the flavor, our server said she could add Peach Puree for an extra $6.00 and basically give me the bottle to make my own mimosas. I upgraded to the $29 but I never got to make my own mimosas. She brought me a glass of potent peach puree already pre-mixed with champagne. I poured most of it out and ask for a top-off of just champagne. We never had the bottle on our table and we barely got them to approach the table with it.    If you are looking for awesome food at a trendy Vegas-central location, choose HEXX (but be sure to make a reservation). If you are looking for delicious mimosas and decent food, hit up the Bellagio Buffet. You'll spend a bit more money, but you'll enjoy unlimited food and potentially have 100% access to the champagne (so long as nothing has changed since I was last there in 2013).",

My breakfast was fantastic, the brioche French toast was perfectly cooked (I hate mushy French toast), the berries were super fresh. My server Tracee was just as good as the meal. Funny, poor service can ruin a good meal...l got lucky with someone who clearly loves what she does. She interacted with everyone around me with such joy. I need more Tracee's in my world :)",

They took my number down and we took some pictures with the Bellagio fountain and walked on the strip for about 40 mins before we got the text. I had requested a table facing the street and we got a great view of the strip.  The servers were quick and attentive. I got the egg Benedict with hollandaise sauce which was rich and tasty , I also got a glass of guava mimosa which was delish! They only list the bottomless mimosa's on the menu but you can order by the glass :)  Definitely a place worth checking out. I also liked the fact that we were waiting outside in the sun after being inside in the dark and stuffy casinos for so long.",

Their brunch selection is great, and I couldn't choose between the delicious looking stacks of carrot cake pancakes, cinnamon roll waffle, or chicken and waffles. I ultimately got the chicken and waffles, and it came with two generous pieces of chicken thighs and breast. The chicken was juicy and paired well with the cheddar waffle and syrup. So delicious!  Service was a little slow, but the manager was great about visiting our table to apologize for a hair in my friend's cappuccino. I definitely will be coming back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

We had the filet minion, mussels and scallops dish, and one of all but 2 of the side dishes.  The filet was melt in your mouth tender.  It was delicious.  All of the side dishes were amazing!!  The mussels and scallops dish was a disappointment.  The sauce broke and separated so it left the seafood in a puddle of oil.  It was sent back and taken off our bill.  Our server Kevin was awesome!!  Very attentive and helpful.  Knowledgeable about wines and the menu.  Was very friendly and laughed with us.    There is indoor and outdoor seating.  There is a bar area.  Our experience here was amazing except for that one dish.  They were very nice about it though and took it off the bill.  I highly recommend this place if your into great food and a fun atmosphere.",

    "text": "Carrot cake pancakes brought me here. The pictures on Yelp looked out of this world. I had to try them for myself.  Spoiler: They looked exactly like the Yelp photos (no Yelpfishing here) and they tasted amazing- more to come.  Since it was breakfast, there was a tiny wait. They take your telephone number and send you two texts: one alerting you that you're on the list and the second when you're table is ready. After less than 10 minutes it was our time to be seated.  We sat near the outdoor portion giving us an indoor/outdoor vibe  Tip- bottomless mimosas are $24 and a single mimosa is $12 so choose wisely.  Service from both our waitress and bus staff were great. Our cups were never empty, which always is a great thing for me.  I ordered the standard eggs, bacon and English muffin breakfast because I forced my friend to split those pancakes with me. My breakfast came with three eggs, cooked to my liking with potatoes, that muffin and bacon. Everything was good and tasty. I loved the potatoes the most. The English Muffin was really thick and chewy- not like what I'm used to but nothing butter and jelly didn't cure.  Then the pancakes. Oh my God. A huge stack of five thick pancakes topped with cream and side of syrup. Initially I was surprised about the size (it was small) of syrup, but these pancakes are so rich you don't need the syrup at all, just smear that icing on them. It's like eating a cake for breakfast and don't we all need more cake in our lives?  Honestly the pancakes made the meal. Worth $14. Totally worth it. I'd pay more and be happy, honestly. Now that I know these are so good I'll be back next time I'm in town and this time I don't think I'll plan on sharing them with anyone!",

    "text": "This is probably my #1 go-to breakfast spot when I'm in Las Vegas. Depending on the day though, it can get busy. I have come here on multiple occasions: by myself and with other people. The attentiveness of the service is really a hit or miss.   I had first come here on a day where my flight to Las Vegas landed earlier than my friends'. I figured I'd try out some French Toast and berries and have a date by myself.  I was immediately greeted by the front staff and seated by a host. Throughout my meal, multiple servers had constantly checked on how my experience was, even engaging in conversation about my trip to Vegas. I even came back the next day with a friend and was greeted by the manager with a 'Welcome back!'  The food was also delicious, but it can get a little pricey. I definitely wouldn't come here on a budget- but luckily I WAS in Vegas after all so I decided to do a little more spending.  French toast with berries, a side of potatoes, orange juice, and a side of bacon totaled to around $40-$45. It was delicious though so I can't complain too much.   The staff were really the reason that made it an experience to have me coming back!  On another occasion, I ordered the same dish and sat with 3 other people in my group. We were seated in the back on a Sunday morning (but it surprisingly wasn't busy).  Unfortunately, the service wasn't as great this time around but I get that things happen and it may be difficult to be on top of all of your tables.  The food was great (but pricey as usual) and we waited a while to receive our checks. The kitchen was also out of a few items that came as a surprise to me.  Overall, I do love this place and the kindness I have received from the management. I try to bring every person who comes to Vegas with me to this restaurant, and I hope that every time I do, they are able to have the same experience that I had the first time I dined in.",

We had to to ask for silverware and to get our waters refilled.   I ordered the waffle since I had a run later in the evening. It was a plain waffle with bananas. One of the best I've had. It wasn't soggy or over cooked. It was fluffy and light. My friend had the French toast which was also good.   There was a miscommunication with the waiter at the end. I had asked to use my Total Rewards points for the bill, but the waiter quickly said they don't allow it. I spoke to the manager and they do accept Total Reward points, but they don't give.

I came here for dinner and ordered the Branzino, which was very crispy on the outside and nicely prepared inside. The service seemed a little slow considering the restaurant was kind of empty, but people watching outside made the time go by.   This place is across the street from the Bellagio fountains. The next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely have to come back for their breakfast.",

    "text": "SO MUCH YES! My friends and I were in Vegas for our fall break and my birthday, and we decided to have brunch here one day because we heard they had bottomless mimosas. We had so much fun at HEXX! You can only have the bottomless mimosas for two hours, but the waiters were so on top of filling up our glasses that this wasn't a problem at all. Literally we would take a sip and set the glass down, and they'd already be filling it up again. The food was delicious as well! I got their breakfast pizza, and I kid you not, I'm still thinking about it. It was so good, I want to learn how to make breakfast pizza myself!  Besides the great service and food, the restaurant was also extremely fun! Maybe just because we're crazy college kids and the people there were fun, but everyone was having a great time singing happy birthday throughout the whole restaurant, and mingling with each other. My friend and I were dying to watch the Vikings game, and they were happy to put it on for us (thank god)! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely remember this place and will recommend it to friends!",

We got the cheesy garlic bread that was very disappointing only cheese and no garlic . The bean burger, veggie omelet and chilaquiles were good. Our desserts were also very good. Definitely recommend this place.",

While it was a little noisy at night due to a loud over-excited party, I will not fault the restaurant for the noise. It is certainly a happening place with delicous food. We split the wedge salad - crisp lettuce, bacon, gorgonzola, candied pecans - which was a delicious beginning to the meal. I had the short ribs - which were completely tender - and my husband had the prime rib. It was not only a beautiful cut of prime rib, but perfectly cooked. We split the creme brulee for dessert - we were scrapimg the bottom of the dish!  A little pricey, but for Vegas on the strip it's what you're going to get. Well worth it. And the waitstaff were great!",

You also MUST try the cinnamon bun appetizer, it was to die for. Our waitress was great, and they were able to swap out the meat on my egg dish for a fruit cup which I really appreciated. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that I did not get the English muffin that was supposed to come with my dish. Luckily there was plenty of food and I wasn't even able to finish the delicious breakfast potatoes, so it wasn't a big deal. We will definitely be back here for brunch on future Vegas trips!",

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon, there was no wait and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. The outside has heat lamps and a wrap around patio of great views of the strip. When our sever came, i was disappointed after asking him if they had a vegan menu and he said \"no\" (without making any recommendations). I noticed there was a veggie pizza i could try with a butternut squash puree that sounded delicious. However, when i got the pizza... it was very underwhelming and there was no flavor. My boyfriend got the French dip and said it was good but he didn't like how the sandwich was split in half instead of in a roll (which makes French dips easier to dip for him).   Pros: great service, amazing city view, decor   Cons: flavorless pizza, no vegan menu   Tips** if you're trying to get a reservation on a busy weekend night or brunch, try doing OpenTable beforehand. They also sometimes have Groupons as specials for dining here.",

The massive sized apple cheddar waffle paired perfectly with the sweet and spicy pickles and the syrup. And the 2 pieces of fried chicken were huge, crispy, and fresh out of the fryer.

The prices, as expected, were high, and it blew my mind that the burgers and steaks didn't come with sides. I ordered the New York steak, but was handed a prime rib instead. I didn't feel like complaining, so I just accepted it with a smile. However, the first bite was RIDICULOUSLY salty. Like, 5-days-worth-of-sodium-in-that-single-bite salty. My manager and I (who also ordered a steak) both sent our steaks back because this girl had size zero slacks to fit into the next day, and I couldn't afford any unnecessary bloating.  Our steaks came back *much* better in terms of seasoning. Definitely more edible, which is good! Unfortunately, the steak was very fatty (don't necessarily blame the restaurant for this, as I know most prime ribs are), and extremely greasy. I wish I could have dabbed it with a napkin but I didn't want my coworkers to judge me! The small side of balsamic glazed onions were extremely greasy as well; I'm sure they drench their food in oil while cooking. Some people love that, but I, however, am not a fan.  We also ordered a dessert platter, and while good, it wasn't super memorable. Service was good, as our waiter was very personable and our food came our within a reasonable amount of time.  If I were to come back to Vegas, I don't think I'd visit this place again. However, it is conveniently located on the strip, and is a good place if you don't mind a high price tag with slightly above average food.",

I ordered the meat omelet, and the meal was great! Guess What was even better? TAYLOR!!!!!! We ordered bottomless mimosas and she didn't let the glass get half way empty before coming to fill us up. She had other large parties, but was still very attentive to all of her Parties. That's something that doesn't happen at restaurants often. Taylor offered premier Customer service.",

Considering it's probably one of the most touristy spots on Earth, the prices aren't that crazy. Of course you're going to spend more than norm, however it is well worth it with Bocelli playing in the background watching the magical fountains shoot a couple of hundred feet up in the air. Great people watching. Excellent service. I didn't have to ask to have my water refilled once. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Great location on the strip, not extremely expensive.  Portions to price is not too bad but still does warrant a $$ rating.  Two sides to sit in, unsure what the real difference between the two is except at night sometimes there is a DJ on one side.  Menu is cafe sized, so not a lot of options but they still have a great variety of options.  I had gotten the mashed potatoes side for $10 but the portion was underwhelming for the price.  I had also gotten a wedge salad for $12, and that was perfect for the price.  For dessert, the cake and shake (21 y/o+) and that was incredibly worth the $9.  Did not purchase any alcoholic drinks so bill ran me $31 before taxes.  Service is great; waitress and delivery folks all moved with haste, checked in with our group's satisfaction, and refilled drinks without us asking.  Even though restaurant was moderately busy, they acted as if we were the only ones there.  The Bellagio fountain \"sneak peak\" view is nice, just remember you have Las Vegas BLVD traffic blaring by, as well as Bellagio property line trees that prevent you from getting a full view of them.  Overall a very pleasant and classy dining experience.  Next time, will have to try the red meats on the menu.",

Today was a completely opposite and overwhelmingly disappointing experience. I booked our bachelorette party for brunch at 12:30, which we arrived promptly for, and despite checking with the front desk multiple times, we were not seated until 1:20. I had raved about the croissants here, assuring my group the wait would be worth it for the flaky butteriness alone. To my dismay, the server told us they had sold out of croissants just 5 minutes earlier...I could actually hear the hearts breaking in our group. Then to top it all off, the server told us bottomless ended at 2 (it was 1:30 by the time our orders were taken), which considering our reservation had been for 12:30 felt like we had been cheated. Hugely disappointing and I will not be recommending this to my friends in the future.",

My only complaint was that a couple of our dishes were a bit bland (halibut itself had minimal flavor but sauce made up for it; chilaquiles we ordered for brunch were average).  However, the hummus we ordered as an appetizer was AMAZING. The pita bread was fresh and warm. The hummus itself, white bean, was perfect!  As the waitress said, \"we made hummus sexy\".  100% agree.  A must try.  Dessert was a pumpkin brulee and as I described it, Thanksgiving in a ramekin. I literally felt like I was home eating all the home cooked-deliciousness of my grandmothers pumpkin pie. Bottomless mimosas for brunch were a nice add.  Definitely will stay on my list of places to eat in Vegas.",

My friend had the banana French toast ($13.95) and he said it was delicious.    To top things off, our waiter Sean was really attentive and checked on us often.  He was very friendly and polite and made an attempt to get to know us.  As we all know, customer service is really what makes a business thrive and Sean is a good interpretation of that.  This is what really makes customers return as I will when I come back to Las Vegas.",

He was fun, suggested food for us, and just took great care of us. He saw me scraping sauce off of my sandwich and insisted they make a new one, which I declined. Well he insisted, and the sandwich came out in record time. He even took some money off of our bill. He was a tall and bulky African American man. If you are a manager reading this, that guy is the best! I'll definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again later this year.",

I feel like you could come here dressed up or more casual and either would be acceptable. It used to be The Sugar Factory restaurant, which was my first favorite but I believe HEXX is still owned by the same parent company so the menu is still kind of similar, food-wise. The space is very clean, sleek, and modern. Cushy, loungey seating and good service. My favorite part of this restaurant, is the location. I love that it's right across from the Bellagio fountains, it makes for such a nice view so sit outside if the weather permits! As for food, I always get the HEXX burger - it has a white chocolate bun! I was told the white chocolate is baked into the bun's batter which gives it that sweet and savory taste next to the bacon and the rest of the burger. I also got one of the goblet drinks once and it was magical. I forget exactly which one, but it was bright blue, it \"smoked\" and had the most enticingly fruity aroma. It was also beyond delicious.",

They sat us at great seats on their patio overlooking the strip with he best people watching. Everything sounded so good! Thankfully Denise our wonderful server told us all about her favorite deserts and explained that they specialize in chocolate which they make in house- they have so many different types too! We ordered the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake which was amazing and coupled it with the Aztec cake and a scoop of ice cream per Denise's suggestion!   Juan who is one of the managers came over half way through our meal to check on us and we ended up chatting and he told us more about the restaurant and how they're trying to offer a 5 star restaurant experience and quality, while keeping it casual - that is exactly how I would describe it!! Juan was so fun and we can't wait to bring our friends and family back to try Hexxx and possibly go to Chateau which he so kindly offered to take us to. Service was awesome, fantastic atmosphere, our desert was amazing! Looking forward to going back to try all the food and drinks we saw everyone around us enjoying! So happy there is finally a late night (better yet 24 hr) restaurant in Vegas that has this quality!!",

My husband got burger - dry and salty. He had to ask for extra sauce (only one good thing about burger) to keep it a little moist . White fish (I think it was haddock) - dry. Thanks to the moist risotto i could eat it. 36$ fish meal should taste better. Punch - the only cool thing about the drink was the presentation -  fog over it. We would love to complain about the food at the dinner but saw server briefly 4 times  - took drinks order,  we were not ready to make food order so he had to come back to take our food order - stopped him to get extra sauce  - dropped at out table sauce - fast - asked us about desert holding already check for us. Pretty much when server gives you check and ask about desrt it's like \"hey are you hungry yes or no well  I already have check for you so I'm done here\".   Spend more than 100$ for dinner but nothing special about this place. Not for celebrating anniversary or any other occasion  maybe just for a quick bite while u walking down the strip because service was fast . We were in and out of the restaurant.   I went to the chocolate tasting next door - it was amazing! Chocolates are very Good! Cookies were great as well. That place deserves 5 star",

The were very delicious, especially with the Fresno peppers and the lime flavored oil. My wife and I both ordered hamburgers and we were both very pleased. We like our hamburgers rare and very often they are too overcooked for our tastes. These burgers were cooked to perfection.   Hexx has great food, great service, and great ambience.

As we were leaving, I noticed they had a nice little bar as well that we might have to try before we leave.",

Lemony zest to compliment the lightly salted crispy broccolini.   Service was a bit slow, but the atmosphere and food made up for it.   Tip: VIP access (SPG) card gets you a table very quickly.

He came over and said he would be right with us while on his way to the kitchen. He came back only a few moments later and introduced himself.  He was attentative, efficient, and and great down to earth guy. Once the food came my sis asked for some extra dipping sauce and got it with no problem. He even brought me extra syrup that forgot to ask him for. It was like he was reading my mind. He had about 4 tables to serve at once and never missed a beat.I wouldnt have known he was new if he hadn't mentioned it. CHEERS TO SEAN! Great service, professionalism, friendliness, and efficiency were all of his qualities that made our experience great. We'll be back again!!!  -CARLOS",

We came to restaurant around 1:15pm expecting high expectations as always since I work in the restaurant industry.  We got sat at around 1:15 it took 10 minutes for us to get served. I had to flag another server who then told me my servers name \"Spencer \" but she can take our drink orders. Erick was the busser he was AMAZING !! He was so respectful , very attentive .. honestly he needs to be a server .  Spencer didn't come to our table until I asked for him to do so.. why would I have to ask for my server to come to my table that should be common sense ? Right .. anyway he took our food order .. my cocktail came first then my hot tea why would that happen ? I have no idea improper training no reason why this should happen neither .. now .. moving on food took another 45 minutes to come out the manager came to the table with fruit to apologize meanwhile our server said the food is ready .. confusing .. We told the manager it's been hour she argued with her customers that ticket time\"30minutes \" no reason why manager should argue with customer rule of thumb .. anyway horrible customer service .. will never go back ever again .. very tasty food .. the restaurant can make good money if they train their manager and servers correctly .. servers should always work as a team .. no reason why my plate should be sitting on my table for 20 minutes and take 20 minutes get my Check .. I was on vacation I wasted my whole day in this establishment ..",

The food, at $20 for a sandwich/salad/burger, was below average. By a large margin. I should have known to pass Hexx up by the fact that from the street I could see that most of the tables were empty.   My fiancee had the panzenella salad. Lots of \"white\" lettuce, head lettuce, barely any avocado, barely any other good stuff at all. Her comment of \"my salad in the airport was so much better!\" Summed it up perfectly.   I had the turkey club. A big sandwich, but the ingredients were not great, the fries we worse than McDonalds, and it just wasn't a $20 sandwich. I'm not opposed to the prices, but I'm from Chicago. I know good food. I'll pay $20 for a turkey club in Chi and it will be a memorable experience. The only thing memorable about Hexx is how sub par it was.   Go someplace else. That's all there is to it.",

My girlfriends' Filet was on point. Pricing is reseaonable. 1 thing i didnt like was our server didnt let my girlfriend substitute her asparagus for something else. Im a server & i know it isnt really a problem at all to do that..  3) Drinks: they upgraded from the Sugar Factory's goblets to these even bigger POTIONS! pretty exotic looking drinks with the dry ice. Tried the Jungle Juice & Purple Haze, JJ was excellent!  4) Service: other than the asparagus i cant really complain! The bald busser there is really kept an eye on us & took every plate away asap without us having to ask. Shoutout to him!  5) Time: its pretty packed during the day, but they still open a little later than most restaurants. Went in around 12:30 & they were open a whl Ile longer after that  Overall, this place is definately worth coming!",

It's such a nice restaurant and I wanted a seat outside overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio, but there was a long wait and I had things that I wanted to do before I left Vegas. The bar had immediate seating so I sat there.  I ordered the Chilaquiles with coffee on the side. The coffee was nice and strong (the way I like it) but the meal itself was just ok. Chilaquiles were made with chicken and the chicken tasted like it was leftover and reheated. It wasn't horrible and it was certainly edible but it was  hardly what I expected from a $15 brunch dish.   I would give this place another try (if I'm ever in Vegas again), but I would certainly order something else next time.",

    "text": "I love dinner at this restaurant but brunch is a whole other story. We went for brunch today and were sorely disappointed. The menu is limited and the food wasn't all that impressive. I ordered the veggie omelette which came with an English muffin and potatoes. The veggie omelette was grossly under seasoned and the English muffin was soft and not toasted properly. My friend ordered the meat omelette and she was just as unimpressed as I was with mine. The coffee was not very good which surprised both of us. The total for both was $50 which we felt was way too expensive as the food just was not that good. We will definitely not be coming back for brunch. I gave it two stars for brunch and this is why the average comes out to three stars because dinner is about 4 to 5 stars and so the average comes out to three stars for both experiences. Evening/ dinner: Some of the dinner items were really good and others were average, yet overall, I would come back here and that gives it four to five stars for. Let me start by saying that it is a beautiful restaurant. Cool decor and relaxed atmosphere. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, from the inside of the Paris Hotel, we saw an area where you could sit four people with pillows all around you and two small but still good sized tables. It was comfortable and I totally wanted to chill there. The waiter told us that if we are having dinner, we really should pick a dinner table as there is not enough room in this area. I wish I had listened to my gut feeling because he sat us at a table with chairs that were higher than your average chairs, which most of the tables have, and it was very uncomfortable for me at 5 foot 4\" and I could actually feel my legs falling asleep! I did not want to be rude so I did not say anything but as soon as we were done with the entrees, I asked to move back to the lounge area which was so relaxing and everyone agreed we should've stayed there from the beginning. That is just a clue for anyone that is not as tall and there are tables with normal chairs, and by that I mean they are closer to the ground. THE FOOD: we started out by ordering two appetizers which were the hummus with pita chips and the meatballs. The hummus was just okay. I would not order it again. The meatballs were really good: there are two medium-sized meatballs that come out and the sauce made of tomatoes and cheese around them is delicious. The entrees were as follows: one of my friends got the classic burger and liked it. He said it was not the best burger he's ever had, but it was really good. My friend got the salmon which was amongst clams and a rich broth. She said it was delicious. I got the Seabass, which I was told was one of the chef's favorite dishes. I have to say it was good but not amazing. The roasted Seabass was good, but I have had way way better Seabass. It was on top of a couscous and that was delicious. One of my friends and I got a drink called the desert smash which consisted of gin with several fresh fruits in it and I loved it. This drink that we got was crisp and clean and it was delicious.  The asparagus, which was a side, was absolutely delicious. One of my friends got the crushed Yukon potatoes as a side. It was good. I'm not the biggest potato fan so I would not be the best person to judge it but it was good. We had some very nice people providing the service. We were offered free dessert and two items came out: one was a warm apple pie in the shape of a small round pie with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over it and the other was a brownie with a large scoop of ice cream over it that was really good. We are not big dessert people, yet I will say for people that like sugar, either item was delicious. I am not a big brownie fan, but the ice cream on top of the brownie was outstanding. We will definitely be coming back here for dinner. It was a lovely experience with a very nice staff. There are a lot of items on the menu and it's all about what you like.  Make sure to ask for a table that you know you'll be comfortable at and if all you're going for is either appetizers and drinks or just dessert, the small areas where you can sit amongst pillows with two tables side-by-side, where four people can fit in comfortably, is really cool. Great service, great ambience, great location, good food. We came here because we won a gift certificate at a charity event. I am glad I won it because this was a really nice experience and it exposed us to a very cool restaurant that we are definitely coming back to. Therefore, in summary, brunch is not worth it and we would never go back and there are way better places in Las Vegas, even in that same hotel, for way better brunch. Dinner is very good and I do recommend it.",

    "text": "Loving the atmosphere here at Hexx!  Really loved the menu- so many great options And of course the food was great!    We showed up at lunch time on a Saturday and the place was packed.  It really is in a great spot in the strip.  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio.  Sitting outside is a huge added bonus!  When we arrived there was going to be a 30 minute wait for our table, so we snuck into the bar and snagged a table.  They were so busy we went unnoticed for a little bit.  But once the manager saw that we were at the table with no water or menus she came over and handled everything.  She was amazing, took our order, got the flatware and waters out to us and recommended some great dishes.  She didn't just see us once and get us help-  she stayed on top of our service for our entire meal.  Christina definitely is a top notch manager-  digging in with team.  What great service!!",

I came to Vegas on a birthday surprise trip and I had TRACEE as a server for my final day here. I could not have had a better experience. From beginning to end I felt as if I was embraced and celebrated for being here. She made our party feel overly joyous for choosing this place to end our trip on a great note.   When the bottomless mimosas were ordered for our whole table and they ran out of champagne for a busy day, she turned to rose and embraced it as if I had just upgraded to a premium package.   Overall, restaurant has upbeat vibes with beautiful touches of class from their silverware, glasses, seating, and decor posted all around: classy and aged-framed tapestries, artwork, grand windows viewing the strip, and well set light fixtures with hundreds of wine bottles displayed on both the ceilings and walls in the bar area.  Food came out with class with no surprise. 10/10 would recommend for anyone looking to celebrate with class and joy. Cheers.",

Luckily, it didn't stop us from experiencing this great dining experience at HEXX kitchen + bar. The modern atmosphere made the whole experience cool. All the furnishings, lighting and decor tied into the theme. The food presentation was very neat and fun. The drinks were smoking, from the dry ice, and the food was hot and fresh.  From the extensive menu, I decided on the pancakes and bacon. The order came with 3 large and fluffy pancakes. Topped with powdered sugar and parted with whipped butter and a nutty maple syrup. They were great and syrup was an awesome pairing with the pancakes. My wife enjoyed the pepperoni pizza that was large enough for two people to enjoy. The pepperoni on the pizza were larger than normal and they covered the pizza, we couldn't see any of the cheese because there were so many pepperoni. The pizza was topped off with toasted shaved garlic. The garlic looked like large Rice Krispies, but the flavor make the pizza even more savory. We both enjoyed the bottomless mimosas that were a great kick start to our day.  I really enjoyed the restaurant and will definitely go back to visit, on my next trip to Vegas.",

However, just like everything else in Vegas be ready to pay for it.  Overall not as expensive as other not so yummy places tho. One order of chilaquiles, brioche French toast, reg pancakes, chicken and waffles, French dip sandwich and a pepperoni pizza came to almost $200.00. Yes that also includes two root beers, a chocolate \"hexx\" drink and one of their $36.00 drinks with a dry ice show.",

We started at number 2 on the list and they had the worst service and a sad representation of the advertised drink. We made our way to Hexx and then never left to go any further. We split a Colossal, it was gorgeous!  A pitcher of spicy Bloody Mary w a meal perched on top. They infuse their vodka there with basil and spices, it tasted sooooo good. Don't forget to tell then to make it spicy so they can use this special blend. We sat on the patio and watched people go by, it was a good time.  We had to come back later that night and received the same great service and drinks during happy hour. Thank you Hexx.",

No cocktail under $15, even though delicious, they add a lot of ice in a small glass. And it took a while to get drinks, the server said the bar was backed up. I ordered the pasta cabrona ($23) and it was very yummy. My husband ordered the sausage pizza ($19) he said it was just ok. We ordered a jumbo shrimp appetizer ($18) and it came with 4 jumbo shrimps and cocktail sauce. Yes this place was pricey but the location and setting was the best part. Great for people watching and a view of the Bellagio! You're almost under the Eiffel Tower so that was pretty cool to look up. The best part was Ben and Lauren from the Bachelor show sat behind us, I was pretty excited about that. I would definitely go back to this restaurant for a nice date night next trip to Vegas.",

Previously I never dined with them but I was a bit hungry upon my return from a show (I ordered around 12am) so I decided to give it a try. I was dining solo and was directed to sit at the bar. Once I placed my order it took a while for the food to get out so I changed my order for takeout. Service was somewhat efficient however not very warm or inviting. The lady ringing me up said she was unable to charge my room as there were too many people with my name and that I did not come up under my room number. Although it was not a terrible inconvenience I found it a bit open to doubt as I made 2 charges to my room within the same hour prior to placing my order with no issue.  The portion size of the Gnocchi Pomodoro was fairly small and the creamed corn seemed more like a liquid with bits of lobster. I do understand that it was late night dining and thus my rubric should be adjusted. However after arriving to my room and ascertaining what I received for roughly $60 (including tax + tip), I did not feel fairly satisfied with the meal.  I feel if I were to actually dine-in I might have a better opinion so I will do a follow up on my next trip.",

But we were prepared, so I suggest you be.  This restaurant has beautiful decor, trendy chic vibe, an open patio that faces the strip so you can watch the fountain show at the Bellagio, and the staff was super friendly.  We had a party of 18, reservations on a Saturday at 6pm, & were seated as soon as we arrived.  I ordered the 16 oz prime rib, with the bacon wrapped asparagus (a la carte) of course.  He had the rib eye & lobster cream corn.  Everything was absolutely deeeeelish! Only negative was my steak was the last out, & the waitress didn't bring me au jus... we celebrated a birthday and the manager on duty was sweet enough to send over cake pops & red velvet cake at the end of the meal.  Makes the $175 dinner worth it, I would definitely go back.  Thanks Hexx!",

The carrot cake tasted exactly like carrots! I love the added walnuts & the cream cheese melted everything together. The corn beef hash was surprisingly amazing! The added pickles was a good touch. The hollandaise sauce was so yummy. I wanted more. The beef wasn't dry. I love that it was equal portion of everything so you get a little bit of everything with every bite.

The sticky bun comes warm with cream cheese frosting and a caramel drizzle. The Chicken and waffles was ok, it was nice that the chicken is boneless but the syrup is SUUUUUPER sweet so be prepared. I asked for hot sauce and they bring it out in a small dish, it tastes like seasoned tabasco sauce (not my favorite 'seasoned' flavor). But the dishes were all cooked well and as we ordered them. The waffle was crisp & so was the chicken. The server Shawn was accommodating, professional, and kind as he was the last time I came to Hexx, the drink/water guy was also super nice. I'd like to try the Chopped shrimp salad next time I come as the shrimp weren't over cooked and were a nice size.",

    "text": "The Good: The actual restaurant is beautiful, big, and located at a great spot on the strip. There was a busser there who was very friendly and tried to be as helpful as he could. We actually tipped him separately for trying to make it work.  The Bad: SLOW. Yes, it's busy but they were altogether forgetting some of our drink and food items. We were here for a bachelorette party so, of course, we're trying to really have fun and enjoy ourselves. Nobody wants to get annoyed or upset on vacation, but I swear places like this take advantage of that vacation mood. Eventually we had to start pointing out \"why hasn't she gotten her cappuccino yet?\", \"why has everyone had their food for at least 10 mintues and she hasn't?\" \"This is supposed to be bottomless mimosas we've been waiting for a refill\". Then people started hustling, bringing the forgotten items, apologizing and taking things off the check. It shouldn't have to be like that. Wish I could say the food was amazing and made up for everything but it was normal breakfast food. Nothing knocked our socks off.",

The restaurant is pretty large and offers both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for a table by the window facing the strip but if you sit outside you can get a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  For dinner, we ordered the Caesar salad and the 16 oz. ribeye steak along with the risotto, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Everything was delicious but we especially enjoyed the caesar salad and ribeye steak. For Vegas, we were also pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty affordable, too!  Overall we really enjoyed our dining experience and was given great service by everybody while we were there! We will definitely return next time we're in Vegas!",

    "text": "Ventured here because of Groupon! I've seen this featured on Groupon for the past few years and always have been curious. Conveniently located right in front of Paris this quaint little restaurant is right next door to Alexxis with a yellow front. There is no walking through hotels to find this place you can't miss it and the door is right there front on the strip.    We did have reservations which i don't think is a necessity but helpful depending on the time of the year. We got seated right away with the friendliest server who had a great conversation with us about Vegas in general and the menu selection.    This place has lots of great unique drink options. They have quite a few beer selections to choose from and if you're a cocktail girl like me then you'll like this place even more! They do offer pitchers of mixed drinks which is probably a better deal if you plan on having more than one drink.   We just ordered appetizers which we opted in for the calamari and the spinach artichoke dip. The calamari was spicy! If you like spicy and buffalo sauce then you need to order this app you'll be pleased. I'm not much of a buffalo fan but my husband is and he ate more of this than i did. The calamari wasn't greasy and did have a lot of taste just not what i prefer.  The spinach artichoke dip was delicious. I was looking forward to their bagel thin dips that I've seen in previous reviews to dunk them but ours was served with just plain chips which that was a disappointment but it was still very good!   I would definitely visit this place again for lunch or brunch. Their brunch menu looked fantastic and they do serve brunch options throughout the day i believe. Service was great and food was decent.",

They sat us at their neighbors restaurant I believe Alexx. Very small tables and it was a bit cold and a huge window wide open right in front of us, that's my only complaint. Beautiful view of the bellagio fountain but cold.   The food and drinks are just amazing! I've never had such great thanksgiving meal and I can cook lol but this place is just like finger licking good. The service was amazing! The waitress saw there was no room to put the side plates so she brought a small side table, very accommodating.   You can park at planet Hollywood  or the palazzo and walk to the place. truly recommend.",

We asked the concierge at our hotel if there were any nice late night spots and she recommended Hexx Kitchen and Bar. It's actually located in Paris Hotel and is a pretty large restaurant.   We were seated in a nice section with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain show which is absolutely beautiful at night. There was live music as well which was nice. It was a Friday night. Not sure if they have live music daily or just on the weekend. Ambience was perfect for a date night. Service was great and food was good. Prices were good as well. I liked the menu. We had chicken sausage pizza with fig and it was delicious. They even gave me a cute little cupcake at the end of our meal for my birthday! Only minus was that it was a cold evening and the front doors were open but they were really accommodating and closed them when we (and another table) asked. I would definitely return whenever I go back to Vegas. Just ask to be seated where you can view the fountain show- especially at night!",

I thought it was a small place but it's actually huge!  There's no restroom in the restaurant but there is a casino restaurant on the right side of the casino.  If you come in from the casino side, you have to walk the long corridor through the restaurant to see the host/hostess.   As it was slow/middle of the week,  we were seated right away.  Our waiter, Chris came to introduce himself and took our drink orders.   He was very helpful and attentive.  Since they are famous for Sangria,  we ordered Breeze air and Pinky swear.   Both drinks were delicious and came with fruit.  We ordered the jumbo crab cake,  surf & turf sliders and veggie burger.   Everything was delicious!  Every single person we interacted with was welcoming, pleasant and professional.   Both inside and outside area were clean. They do heat the patio on cooler days.  We'll definitely be back,  next time we're in town.",

Wouldn't be a big deal but O don't understand why they wouldn't have a sign instructing folks where to go)  The food left much to be desired particularly for the high cost. I had a braised short rib with mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. My Wife had the fillet with blue cheese on top and French fries on the side. Her medium rare steak was difficult to cut and not tender at all. The only flavor you tasted was a mouthful of pepper. The fries were limp and undercooked. We sent them back and the fries were removed from our Bill. My meal was ok but again could have been far more tender and for $40 I don't expect something to just be \"ok.\"  I would be curious about their brunch but I would avoid having dinner here when for this cost there are far better options on the strip.",

So this what we ordered for dinner: Calamari: came out with buffalo and ranch dipping sauce. Nothing special about it. Jumbo crab cakes: $18 for one!! Eeekkkk....it was also quite forgettable  Braised short ribs: came with mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The short rib was very tender and tasty. Hangar steak: seasoned and cooked well. I'd recommend this dish. However, it came al la cart so you'll have to add a side or sides for $10/each.   Service: our server Abe was nice and attentive. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we dined there around 530pm in a Saturday evening.   Also you'll be charged a \"concession fee\" of 4.5%!! WTH??",

Both times we sat outside, near the misters, and got to enjoy the fresh air and see the fountains at the Bellagio across the street.   For dinner, the server recommended the fish (I can't remember the name, but it was similar to black cod and it was absolutely delicious.) My friend had a salad, which was also delicious.   For brunch, we had the chilaquiles(these are a must-get at Hexx! So amazing!), the protein omelette (also delicious--i would definitely order it again) and a Bloody Mary and mimosa.   The service was fantastic and the overall experience will definitely bring us back to Hexx!",

I tried vegetable pizza, chicken & waffles, calamari, and fiesta punch bowl. Fried chicken was a bit too salty for me and calamari was very thin, almost did not taste any of the actual calamari, just the fried batter with ranch and buffalo sauce. Also, just so you know, there will be \"CNF\" fee on your bill on top of sales tax and tips and the Hexx kitchen + bar is connect/ the same as Alexxa's Bar.",

Upon showing up right at 7pm, the hostess asked us to wait just a little until our table was ready, even though the restaurant was not full (at least 1/3 of tables were open, including at least 3 which would have accommodated our group size).  After a 15 minute wait, we were seated. Unfortunately no servers came by for yet another 15 minutes - we finally had to flag someone down. By then we were all ready to order both drinks and food. Our drinks took another 20 minutes to come out. So, here we were with a 7pm reservation were just being served our drinks almost an hour later. We were very frustrated and thankful that we had such good company and a decent view of the Bellagio fountains to distract us from the poor service. Luckily our food came out shortly after - I was a little underwhelmed by my entree of the Bucatini, and the added chicken was quite dry. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal (many girls ordered the antipasto salad).  So, the food was ok/good but not amazing, and service pretty terrible. Although, I will note that the server offered to separate the checks for each of us without us even asking, which was very appreciated.",

No problem? Low carb? Got it! Gluten free? Yep? Vegetarian? Gotcha covered.  Standout starters are their pork rinds (yes) enlivened with vinegar and pickled fresnos you add yourself, veggie pizza that is as pretty to look at as it is to eat; caprese salad that isn't a bore; some of the best calamari I've had in a long time; roasted broccolini that's a nice  change and candied bacon that you'll fight over. And that's just for starters. Plus there is tons more. But save room for dessert because it is Hexx after all and the chocolate is made on premises and it's a real star of the Vegas strip. You can even get a tour and a lesson on how they make it and have a chocolate tasting from all the regions they purchase their beans.",

This is a nice spot if you don't want all the bells and whistles of over the top Vegas brunch but still wanna fill up before a long day ahead. My party and I opted for all breakfast items such as the protein omelette, veggie omelette and a three egg platter. HEXX takes substitutions with no hesitation--add mushrooms, add sausage, and swap English muffin for toast, respectively, though forgot my boyfriends wheat toast the first time.  Each plate came with Parmesan home fries which could've used a touch more salt during the cooking process. No one at my table happened to clean their plates but we all left stuffed and satisfied!",

    "text": "I went here twice (with family going a third time without me) and I'm taking all of those experiences into account for this review. If I had only visited in the early morning this would probably be a 5 star review.  We came here very early shortly after opening for a breakfast. We were still on East Coast time and decided to get some food and avoid the crowds.  Service was attentive and friendly.   We were sat on the balcony in a still cool breezy morning.   I ordered the eggs benedict and my husband had the cinnamon bun waffles. The food was perfect, I was completely in love with my benedict, perfectly cooked eggs with ham and asparagus ontop of gorgeous scalloped potato. Probably the best benedict I've had in a very long time. My husband was over the moon with his breakfast as well since it came with an actual mountain of cream cheese icing.  The problem we get into is the other visits. On my recommendation family went later on in the day and had a much less enjoyable experience.  A day or so later we stopped by in the evening on a whim to grab a few drinks and same deal.  It seems that the second they get busy, all bets are off. They recieved cold food, and the night with drinks we had an incredibly long wait for ordered drinks, so long we couldn't justify getting more than one.   So all in all, it's a good enough place but they really struggle when it comes to dealing with a full house. Unfortunately, where they're situated on the strip, they will ALWAYS have a full house during peak times.  If you can go crazy early like I did, you'll have a great time, otherwise maybe choose somewhere else!",

We were able to get a table on the patio right away though and even though it was a brisk November morning, they have heaters so it didn't bother us at all. In fact, the view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains were a wonderful addition to our dining experience. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my mom had the chilaquiles. We shared dishes. WOWZER! Best of both I have had in Vegas!  They also have a $24 bottomless mimosa deal. It's only for orange juice but still was enjoyable. Service was fast. They make their own jelly which was cool. Overall 5 out of 5! I will be back for dinner!",

The chicken and waffles came with pickle slices but they were sweet the waffles were nice and fluffy and the chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and the meat was great on the inside. The pancakes were fluffy and they came with powdered sugar in them. We also got a side of bacon with the pancakes because the pancakes just came by themselves. The service here was great , I'd recommend sitting outside to see the nice view of the strip if it's not tooo tooo hot. We were seated pretty quickly with no wait and served quickly as well. The restaurant is wonderful it reminds me of Hawaii the way it's set up. This restaurant was great I'd recommend it just make sure you call in before to see if there was a wait time so you don't have to wait.",

The Butter Lettuce salad was HUGE. My steak was perfect. Hubby had salmon and it was on a bed of peas and who knows but it was delicious. BE CAREFUL OF THE WATER...

    "text": "My boyfriend and I made reservations on open table to dine here one of the nights on our recent Vegas trip. We called ahead and asked to be seated outside so we could watch the Bellagio fountains. At first the host said that the outdoor seating was first come, first serve, but we told him that our entire goal was to be seated outside, so if they wouldn't be able to accommodate that, then we would just find another spot - he quickly changed his tune and confirmed that we'd be able to sit outside at the time of our reservation.   The view outside was definitely what we were looking for. The patio also had heat lamps there which would be great for colder evenings. Our server was very energetic, made a few wine suggestions, and brought out some water and our wine. He was mostly scarce through the remainder of our dining experience (but not absent...just gave us space).  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip to start. While the dip itself was delicious, the chips seemed like they were just store bought. Would have been nice to have had something more fresh and/or authentic. Also the chips are too thin for this hearty dip - they kept breaking when we tried to scoop up some of the dip. We then shared the mushroom risotto and the bone-in ribeye. The risotto, while it was tasty, was mostly just OK, nothing incredible. The steak was ordered medium rare, and was served slightly more cooked than I typically prefer, but it was still yummy. Our total bill (which included a bottle of wine, an appetizer, one side, and one steak) for about 160$ after tip. We also had a 5% off coupon from Tix4Tonight. A bit overpriced, as neither of us were blown away by any of the food, but all in all it was an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "We came in here some friends and unfortunately there was any Normas roach problem crawling across the floor and there was some screaming involved by my girlfriend the table behind us had three people and the woman almost vomited in side of her napkin and she slammed down her food To gentleman from another table got up and we're trying to catch this enormous and stomp on it which caused a huge scene Everyone was gagging and yelling the roach was approaching my girlfriend shoe since she jumped out of the table she left the shoe at the chair and ran towards me while I was trying to pay the bill  Manager name Christian came by and basically left at the situation and my friend became very frustrated and then he took my card without saying a word and slid it and hand it back to me  I calmly questioned him as to why he had nothing to say as my girlfriend was sick to her stomach I was laughing because the scene was so crazy and everyone was getting worked up over this situation that once I came in contact with Christian I just couldn't believe that his attitude was basically\" whatever\" What made matters worse was a Nother woman manager approached when she heard all the screaming and commotion she didn't do anything but roll her eyes and say that she was calling security  Then we were questioned If we were even guest at the Hotel and yes we were.   There was nothing security could have done as we did pay our bill & for people in total had raise their voices and it just seemed like they wanted everyone out of the restaurant  For future reference lady instead of calling security why don't you just call an exterminator Christians only excuse was that he has no control over what bugs enter his property.   The food was not bad at all But I will never recommend this place and I'll never returned ever not after the way that they treated everyone who was just trying to enjoy their dinner.  They could have at least said us someplace else and offered us a cup of coffee. But not an apology at all which makes me wonder about the health inspection.  I went on Facebook and told everyone and show the people live video of everyone freaking out over this roach. And my friend Steve said that that's not the first time he heard about there past control problems and that the place was disgusting.   It was my friend first night in Vegas first night staying at the Paris.  We wish we would have went to Bouchon instead.",

    "text": "Wowowow. I didn't do too much research into this brunch place before making a reservation purely on the basis that it had bottomless mimosas and a view of the Strip, but HEXX ended up being one of my unexpected highlights of Vegas.   There was a slight hiccup in getting us seated - we were slightly late for our reservation but called in ahead. When they tried to seat us a few minutes later, there was some miscommunication with the hostess and she led us around the restaurant in a confused sort of way while speaking to someone on her headset before apologizing and bringing us back to the front lol. But after 5 minutes or so we were seated for real, and in a WONDERFUL spot on the patio that overlooked the street and the Bellagio fountains just across from us.   I have to say that the atmosphere here is worth the 5 stars alone - it's busy but in a good, excitable sort of way, the servers are so warm and attentive, and the location is spectacular - located in Paris Las Vegas (the bathrooms are actually outside the restaurant in the hotel itself, so I got to walk around and explore) right on the streetside. Because we were seated outside, we got to absorb the energy of the Strip and the sheer quantity of passerby while still hearing live music from inside - plus every 15 minutes we got to see a show from the fountains! I would definitely suggest requesting a table outside or at least with a view of the street.   And then there's the food!! I got the chicken and waffles, and considering I've only ever had Roscoe's chicken and waffles, this was deliciously impressive - the fried chicken was soooo satisfying, and I loved the apple cheddar waffle. My BF really enjoyed his corned beef hash. They also have $24 bottomless mimosas, and these servers mean bottomless - they were topping me off constantly, and by the end I had definitely indulged in my money's worth.   I highly recommended HEXX to friends that I met up with right after, and they visited the day after for brunch and had just as great of an experience. In terms of casual brunch on the Strip, this is absolutely perfect!",

From beginning to end, she helped with any questions and knew about everything to do with the menu as well has the chocolate they specialize in making. She was super friendly and hard working. So thanks for making it a great experience.   As for everything else. We were able to walk in and be seated right away. The meals are reasonably priced when compared to many other places on The Strip.   As for me, I had the prime rib. It was probably close to an inch thick, tender and juicy. Be sure to make use of the au jus and creamy horse radish dips. It also comes with a side of mashed potatoes.  My girlfriend opted for the flat iron steak (the best butcher cut).  It was delicious and perfectly cooked. Her side of roasted cauliflower really hit the spot. The spicy aoli provided the flair and the spiced almond provided the crunch.",

I honestly had never noticed this place but i was browsing travelzoo and found a deal saw the good reviews and thought what the heck,so i got the travel zoo that included drinks SO GLAD I DID! We had to make reservations so I did make a reservation for the next day no problem. So we arrived 7pm reservation on July 3 seated right away. Restaurant is open air so though we were inside it was like being outside without the sun scorching down on us which was great. Our server, Mark was absolutely fabulous very attentive but no too much. Travelzoo was two drinks,apps,entrees, and desserts. For drinks we got the hexx fusion and the raspberry fizz SOOO GOOD! For apps bf got a salad I got the shrimp ceviche...the ceviche was AMAZING it was soooooo good!!! I would have bought a tub to take home if i could have (i do wish it came with more chips) but it was so yummy. For entrees we got the prime rib (cooked medium well) and the scallops. Both were nothing short of delicious my scallops came with carrots..Idk what they did but even the carrots were delicious and the prime rib was cooked to perfection comes with au jus just perfection. Desserts were fabulous too, s'mores and red velvet cake. This is my new favorite place and I'll be here EVERY trip with or without the travelzoo coupon because it is so worth it!! Yeah",

    "text": "I recently came here on a Saturday around noon for their weekend brunch. We had a group of about 6 girls and had no problem making a reservation and being seated quickly. We sat inside which had a huge seating area and was full of sunshine. One downside though is that they don't actually have their own restroom so you have to use the casino ones.  For food I went with the corn beef hash. I enjoyed the flavor of the sweet potatoes, but did wish they were a little bit more crispy. The portion size was more than enough which made the price worth while to me. I also had the bottomless mimosas which were great. They certainly kept it topped off at all times, great service!  Overall I'd recommend this place for a great brunch option on the strip.",

I bet Hexx does a lot of awesome food. But their chilaquiles is not one of those things. My friends loved their chicken with waffles and chicken salad. I just made a bad choice. They have a pretty diverse menu I will just have try something else.   The servers were really nice although the hostesses were a but abrasive even though when we showed up it wasnt packed.",

Prime rib- did I say it was delicious?!?! Suggesting you share this one with someone. I couldn't finish it.   Dry aged rib eye- packed with flavor! Every single bite! I love it when steaks are seasoned just right. It shows care in the process of making the food.   Customer service- what an informative young lady! We had questions about a few things and she knew all the answers! She was prompt and filled out glasses often. We were never down from our high after one bite of the meat because she also kept us going. I do want to mention that the young host was lacking in friendliness. It felt like he looked down on us and responded with the hoity toity attitude. Dropped our menus on the table and left. Luckily, we had a stellar server and an even more amazing meal!!!",

The ONLY drawback is that it is connected to Paris which is moderately atrocious, and you have to use the casino/hotel bathrooms.",

The following Saturday, we headed in based on a recommendation from another bar to try their New York strip with Bearnaise Sauce on the side.  We were not disappointed.  We ordered the NY strip which my wife and I split, added their delicious roasted brussel sprouts in a balsalmic sauce, and asparagus wrapped in ham.  WOW!  No huge portions but just right.

The servers were dancing and had us doing the wave. The best brunch I've been to in Vegas thus far. Prices are also reasonable and the staff is super friendly and attentive. Definitely give this place a try if you're ever in the area! I give the food 2 thumbs up. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu (for brunch that is).",

I resorted to getting ala Carte sticky bun and caramelizad bacon which were tasty. Service was sub par, borderline rude and not very attentive.

Location: ideally situated right across from some of the major resorts like The Cosmopolitan. Easy walkability.  Service: we were told that there would be a 20min wait and we got seated in 10min! Excellent service as well!  Food impressions: we tried 2 lunch items, both excellent and the portions were definitely on the larger side.   Breakfast Croissant: amazing croissant filled to the brim with Black Forest ham and aged cheddar. Croissant was crispy and melted in your mouth. Came with a side of grilled fingerling potatoes drizzled with sea salt and some ketchup. Easily one of the better breakfast croissant I've had in a long time!  Veggie Omelet: was very tasteful and filling. Came with peppers, onion, spinach and mushrooms. In addition to the English muffin included they added some baked fingerling potatoes. The croissant is still a better lunch item depending on your preference.   Service was efficient and courteous. No complaints!",

We came here on a whim a month ago and loved them so much we made it a point to come back on our visit this past weekend. They have a great brunch menu and what we tried on both trips was awesome (chicken & waffles, cinaroll waffle, eggs benedict).  I recommend getting a reservation, it's not hard and cuts out the waiting. But even without a reservation it takes only 30-40 minutes to get a table, giving you time to wander into Paris for a few before they text you to come back.  Highly recommended.",

I had the grilled king salmon with arugula salad and clam chowder and ordered the broccolini to share.  The description of the salmon dish is misleading.  The chowder is not thick but merely a broth that the salmon is placed in with some arugula sprigs floating in it.  You will not be getting a salad or a chowder.  They need to rename this dish.  Thankfully, our waiter explained it to me at the time I ordered it.  The dish was very, very good.  I wanted more of it.  My husband opted for the crab cake and a salad and he was also very satisfied.  Upon receiving our bill, the waiter gave us each a piece of their dark chocolate.  I LOVE dark chocolate but this was inedible.  I had to spit it out.  Bitter beyond words.  I did try some chocolate at their candy shop and it was very good so don't let this discourage you.  If they want to encourage folks to buy their candy, they should rethink those samples.  This will be a stop the next time we visit Vegas.  I do agree with the poster that said the patio seating was uncomfortable.  The view is great but they do need to improve the seating.",

If it were just the food it self sadly a 3.5 star would be accurate. We got the Cinabon Waffles the Chicken and waffles and hex Egg Benedict. 1out of two satisfied dishes hex Egg Benedict far surpassing the waffles. The Benedict was a delicious surprise where in place of a English muffin as a base there was layers of delicious potato. The chicken and waffles I expected a more moist tasty chicken, not something out of a public school cafeteria kitchen. Honestly it would have been better with mc Donalds chicken nuggets instead of the dried chicken strips that came with it. It was so dry with no taste and a rough texture. The waffle it self was nothing impressive just a normal waffle with cheddar coloring to it. The cinabon waffle was okay, if it weren't for the presentation and light cream cheese frosting, the waffle it self would fell epicly. It certainly did taste like a cinabon but it was rough to chew and swallow as well as had a chewy texture that taste like they microwaved the waffle before serving. The Wait staff and atmosphere are very delightful. I hope you are taking care of the staff because there the only reason why I wouldn't by pass the restaurant for a second chance.",

It is a great location on the strip and provides great food and drinks while you sit and people watch:) Although Alexia wasn't our server, she really completed the experience by giving us great recommendations for the weekend and gave us her True opinions about the different clubs. Kyle was another person on the staff who gave us great info about the Vegas experience and was so kind and attentive to our table. We really enjoyed our time at Hexx and would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good drinks and a fun time!",

    "text": "I came all the way down the strip from the Luxor with my kids and sister because she came here before. She said the food and drinks were awesome. When we got there the restaurantp had changed since she last went there. I was expecting a candy type theme since it was right next door to a candy store. My sister had stated this also in the first place since this was the main reason we went. I have never been looked at so coldly from a hostess before we even exchanged words. She unwillingly greeted us and asked how many in our party. I had my two young kids with me, one in a stroller. They said they don't allow strollers in the restaurant. I could see if it was a big traveling bulky stroller that I had it would be a problem, but I didn't. It was a simple folding one. So I said it was fine and that I could hold my baby and fold up the stroller so that it would not be in the way. It could easily lie underneath the table. They said ok. Once we got seated to the table, I heard the hostess tell the server passing by that she had a table up but in a way that sounded like \"ugh you got a table of 5, so sorry you have to serve these people with kids.\" Once we sat down, I thanked the hostess and she just looked at me with this half ass smile like \"yeah your welcome, your lucky to be seated in here.\" Then just walked away. I was like ok that's it. I tried to look pass the rude glares from the hostesses and server. So I said let's leave. And we did. Will not recommend this place because of the condescending looks and attitude from the hostesses who think their sh** don't stink.",

He checked on us maybe twice and every time he filled my friends water glass she would say thank you and he wouldn't even acknowledge that! I didn't want to give a tip but my friend convinced me it was the right thing to do BUT not to give him any more than 10% which I didn't!

    "text": "Best dining view of the Bellagio and the fountain show - they have a great outside dining patio area to people watch with a great view of the strip.  The inside dining area is pretty spacious and can accommodate large parties. Very urban chic - the decor is really sleek and modern. Reservations were easy on opentable and service was friendly and prompt.  Our waiter was personable and made suggestions on appetizers/ main course. We ended up trying the yellow watermelon app - which was interesting - not bad not great - I'd recommend it if you're looking to try new things. It was a refreshing dish, slightly sweet from the watermelon, slightly tangy from the lime juice and the feta cheese. The chili string garnish gave it an interesting herbal kick. Again not my favorite dish of the night but not bad either if you're looking for something new to try.  The tomato soup was delicious - pricey for a small bowl but super good. Creamy consistency but not too heavy. The garlic and basil oil complimented the soup well. Slightly too much basil oil but I spooned some out and it was fine.  For main dishes I tried the tagliatelle bolognese - short rib pasta - portion was good. Flavor was on the lighter side but I guess less salt is healthier lol? The truffle ricotta was delicious and complemented the short rib nicely. The short rib however was under seasoned and could have been more flavorful. Ok dish in my opinion.  The bf got the roasted sea bass - delicious! Just the right amount of seasoning, light but flavorful and grilled perfectly. Slightly crispy on the outside and edges and light/flaky in the center. I didn't care for the couscous drizzled around the fish as the texture was odd but everything else on this dish was great.   Overall a great place for dinner and a view on the patio. They have a chocolate factory next door where you can see the sweets being made. Service was great, food was good. Prices are on par with what you would expect in vegas - high yes but where is it not?",

Anyhow, set a plate of Southern food before me, deconstructed or faithfully artery-clogging, and I will savor it.  I ordered a \"re-imagined\" shrimp and grits entree, which sounds like a violation of a sacred art form but was in fact utter melt-in-your-mouth fabulosity; spicy prawns over a pillow of polenta with gruyere bechamel and sauteed spinach. The drinks, on the other hand, were an overpriced bummer. I should have stuck with my usual sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio, but a fruitier drink sounded better at the time.",

    "text": "The food at this place is ABSOLUTELY the best ever! We ordered the filet mignon (w/ peppercorn sauce), halibut, and two sides (the cauliflower and mashed potatoes). Everything was PERFECT!! It was all SO fresh and light and I would have put away two more servings if I could have (happily stuffed with the more than sufficient portion sizes). I'm still even dreaming about that cauliflower and the SAUCE... mmMM! So of course, after reading my rant over the divine food, you might be wondering to yourself \"then why four stars?\" WELL! Unfortunately, the front of the restaurant needs to get their shit together. With a reservation for two, we waited 25 minutes for indoor seating after being told 5 minutes by the hostess. One small party of three had been waiting 45 minutes (YES. 4. 5.) for indoor seating after ALSO being told the wait time was 5 minutes. When we were finally seated, we looked around the restaurant and it was half empty. It didn't make sense that they could not seat the small groups that were waiting. It was kind of frustrating actually, and the four hostesses appeared apathetic and fresh out of fucks. Just pushing everyone to the side and saying \"it will be 5 minutes\" and collecting us all for like 20-40 instead. WHO KNOWS! But seriously, despite the shit customer service at the hostess stand, the overall experience was worth it because of the food and serving staff (shout-out to Teddy who was an absolute hero of the night and HILARIOUS). Serving staff and the food made it AT LEAST four star worthy. So if you can get over the four 18 year old girls at the front who forget how to count or whatever was the issue, you won't be disappointed!! Make this a must stop, but don't take any shit from those girls at the front. SAY SOMETHING IF YOU'VE BEEN WAITIN They will forget you.  To the manager response:  Hi!! We had a reservation for two at 9 on May 29, 2018. I appreciate your response!!",

    "text": "Chocolate sampling? Yes please!  Hexx Kitchen + Bar has taken over the previous business Sugar Factory which I believe moved to the Towne Center location in Las Vegas. They offer a variety of sweet confections as well as savory dishes. However, all that I sampled was some of their vanilla gelato which satisfied my sweet tooth for the moment. We sat along the patio bar which offered a great view of the strip, people watching and the Bellagio fountains.  After finishing my scoop of gelato, we wandered inside to browse their novelty items and came across their Chocolate Bar which was the highlight of my visit here. The offerings were pure chopped chocolate from Peru, Tanzania, Venezuela, Ecuador and Madagascar that had hints of fruit, caramel, almond and marzipan.  It was interesting how the Madagascar's fruity acidity didn't hit the tongue until after it melted. My favorite was chocolate from Ecuador which had notes of sweet marzipan, almond and floral flavors. For those that are chocolate fans, be sure to stop by Hexx for a sample of chocolate from around the world.  4 stars!",

The french toast was delicious, though I think the serving size was a little small... it has that classic sweet taste you look for in a French toast, you can add fruits, but I didn't do that. Service was nice, food was alright.",

    "text": "My BF and I lucked out by choosing this place for lunch without doing any research. We decided on sharing a sandwich that came with fries. We really wanted to try the smothered fries shared appetizer too but didn't want to get to carb crazy so we ordered the Prime rib sandwich and asked if the fries could be changed to \"smothered fries\". I was expecting some long winded explanation as to why they can't do that.. but the server said it could be done, no problem. She was friendly and on point from the start. We ordered a few drinks while we were waiting for our meal. The place is pretty big but it wasn't too busy.. the food did take a while to come out, but when we were finally served the wait was worth it.  To start, we didn't tell them we were sharing but they separated our meal anyways which was awesome (they even gave us 2 bowls of au jus).. Like I said, on point! The food was delicious. The sandwich was well made. The smothered fries were so so good. Definitely worth a try! And can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu.   The decor and ambiance inside was enjoyable and classy. If you want to be constantly misted and see \"people of the strip\" walking by, the patio is the place to be.  5 stars for them on the basics & more - Great food, great staff, on top of their shiz (topping off drinks, etc), great atmosphere.   The entrance from the Paris hotel is a little funky but it's nothing to fuss about.. so, you have to walk 20 more feet to get to the front desk - so what? Do you want to  sit, eat and drink or.... not?",

I ordered the margarita pizza and asked for extra mozzarella on top. I ordered another two for my cousins who were from Germany since they wanted the same. Our pizza came and it was just a regular cheese pizza with EXTRA cheese like a pie. The cheese wasn't even fully baked, it tasted like I was eating a thin crust with pounds of cheese. When we told the waiter that this isn't what we wanted her got even more in a bad mood and repeated what we ordered. I'm guessing he didn't know the difference between a margarita pizza with FRESH mozzarella sliced and a regular cheese pizza with mozzarella all over it.  When one of my cousins sent back her pizza for a regular margarita pizza without the extra cheese they brought an actual margarita pizza the way it was supposed to look like. I don't understand what was so hard about understanding that extra mozzarella on a margarita pizza is just a few more slices of the same mozzarella they normally would use, not a greasy thick cheese pizza. I was very disappointed in the poor service we had received as well.",

The waitress was really nice and accommodating in the beginning. We got our cocktails and water but food didn't come until an hour and a half later after we kept following up. At that point we were full on bloody Mary's and dejected from the long wait. One of the hostesses even came up and told one of my friends she couldn't sleep on the table. My friend was exhausted and hungry and put her head down for a reason. An hour and a half to wait for food is unreasonable. The restaurant seemed poorly managed since there were several waiters standing around yet our waitresses seemed to be so busy we couldn't find her most of the time.  Food was sub par and certainly not worth the price. This restaurant needs to better manage its staff and take care to make sure customers are attended to.  Will not be coming back here.  If you do decide to go get the bloody Mary's! But for brunch food there are plenty of other much better options at the same price rate.",

    "text": "The worst restaurant service I've EVER experienced. Four of us ordered coffee and the waitress had only spoon for us to stir our cream and sugar. She said they were \"out of spoons\". We laughed at first but really??? No spoons at a restaurant!!! The table for 4 of us was tiny! 3 other guests had already knocked over their drinks because the tables are so small!!! Glass on the floor everywhere! Then 3 coffee refills later no food. 45 minutes later the waitress apologizes for losing our order and wants our order again . I spoke to Peter the manager about the spoon and ridiculous wait for our food and about how others had their food and we still didn't. He apologized brought out our food soon after and took care of our bill. It was the right thing to do and I thanked him. But with all the restaurant options on the strip, don't waste your time",

We stopped in for a quick bite while we were out on the strip for some fuel food, pretty late in the night (about 2am). Our server Brad, quickly got us waters and took our order. We got the $10 late-night breakfast special-eggs were cooked well and the potatoes were good, but different for me. I definitely enjoyed the bacon. It's hard to believe people can screw up bacon but, you'd be surprised.   I definitely want to come back for the main breakfast menu items.",

    "text": "Came here on a busy Saturday morning for brunch.  My parents and I were seated quickly which was nice. However it took a while for the server to come over to bring water or greet us which was a little disappointing.   We were brought water and had our order taken. My dad an I split the meat omelette and my mom got the carrot cake pancakes. It took a while for the food to come out which was understandable since it was so busy. However the omelette when it was was kinda cold and also not as ordered. I had asked to have no chicken in it and it was loaded with chicken. The potatoes with it were super tasty though. Also when they brought the food out there were no condiments brought with it. I asked to get some jam and butter for the English muffin and hot sauce for the omelette. It took a long time for those to come out. By the time they did my dad an I had already finished most of the omelette.  The pancakes were extremely tasty though.  They were light and flavorful and definitely carrot cake.  We barely saw the server. She would disappear for a while and didn't really check back to see if everything was good. But the busboys were super on hand and helpful. It seemed like they worked harder than our server did.   I think it might be best to try this place on a less busy day to truly experience the quality of the food and service.  I am curious to maybe try it out again because I have heard good things but maybe the day we went was an off day.",

Our orders were taken extremely late, we received our salads well before our appetizers were even delivered to the table, we waited over an hour for food, and over an hour for our checks. A pen cap also fell out of the water pitcher as the waiter was pouring water. Not once did we receive an apology from the waiter for the poor service. The manager did take care of my best friend and I's meals but we are utterly disappointed on our experience, as this was supposed to be a positive and memorable time with our loved ones but it ended up turning into a disaster. I would NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!!",

We had a group of 13 and had no problem. A reservation is needed when you have a big group.  The bottomless mimosas were a great price and they kept refilling the glasses often. You can only stay for two hours when you get bottomless.  The eggs Benedict were great. It had an amazing flavor but the portion size seemed smaller.",

There were 6 of us & the food was plentiful with enough to share. We tried: hexx chopped salad, crispy calamari, crabcakes, and cheesy garlic bread. The chopped salad had hearts of palm avocado,  tomato, sweet drop peppers, artichokes topped with green goddess dressing! The calamari was spicy with buffalo sauce, topped with carrots. The crabcakes were not filled with fillers but were made with authentic crab meat. The cheesy garlic bread... heaven.  Mr. Thompson shared interactive stories about service & the menu throughout our meal. Teddy Thompson is a gem and asset to this establishment.",

It was made with white wine, garlic, butter, chili, parsley and it came with a side of toast.  I liked the Spaghetti & Meatballs balls better.  For the price, the food was just average.  ::Dessert::: We loved the warm Carrot Cake!!  :: Customer Service:: Friendly but it took a while for someone to take our orders.   :: Highlight:: The restaurant is across the street from the Bellagio Hotel.

I ordered the risotto (which I double and triple checked with the waitress was vegetarian - she even went to the kitchen to check if the risotto was vegetarian). 20 minutes later, AFTER, all my non vegetarian friends received their food - I get my steaming hot risotto dish placed in front of me with a large trout dish SMACK DAB in the middle of my risotto. EXCUSE ME! Not to sound like a brat, but I specified - vegetarian NOT pescatarian. Also - this is legit the ONLY  VEG  OPTION  at the restaurant - why are you making it so hard for me to save the world?? Do you want me to die afterwards at the pregame after I've only had spinach and artichoke dip and champagne??  The server was a little moody about remaking the order but I finally got my risotto as everyone was finishing up their meal.  They were good about serving us champagne (we were celebrating 2 birthdays) and the best part was that they gave separate checks for each individual member of our party, which I've genuinely never seen - that was awesome and saved us the hassle of having one person put on their card.  But - would never ever come back here by myself / with family and next time I came to LV I made reservations for another place well in advance. Good for last minute / if you're not vegetarian",

Our server was attentive and gave us great suggestions. We shared the carbonara which was not a True carbonara, no fresh egg or cheese-looked and tasted more like a cheesy Alfredo, was good but not authentic. The Mac and cheese side was really good! So creamy and cheesy. The crispy brocolli and mushroom sides were my favourite, definitely get these to share. The tuna poke was awful.... overpriced, weird citrus flavour and didn't come with any sort of cracker to serve with. It's a more casual place and not fancy in any means- kind of reminded me of cheese cake factory. Their brunch menu looked really good and when I go back to Vegas I wouldn't mind checking that out!",

The waiter was so friendly and helpful directing us to items that could be made gluten free. I ordered the basic egg breakfast, subbing fruit and tomato for the toast and potatoes. It was good, though it would be hard to screw up eggs and bacon. My mom ordered the Eggs Benedict and said it was good, but nothing outstanding. I think HEXX would have been more memorable if we were able to eat some of the other menu items, but due to the need for gluten free, our options were limited and therefore for the price, it was just average.",

They took our order from the menu they were working with. 30 mins passed and we only got a soda from what we ordered. 10 minutes later we got up and left the restaurant. 2 other tables were complaining and 1 table the people got up and left without paying.

We first made sure that my friend's food allergy (peanuts) could be accommodated (it could) and then we were given coffee and water.  Sadly the coffee was very bitter, it couldn't even be mellowed by with creamer, so when asked if I wanted a refill, I said no. They had no problem replacing the drink with something else at no cost. I adore good service like that.   With our orders placed, we waited a bit, chatted with our neighbors and finally got to the food. I'd ordered a ham and cheese croissant which came with breakfast potatoes - which were amazing. The croissant was HUGE and stuffed with white cheddar and ham. It was TOO much and luckily they were able to wrap half in foil and I was able to take that for a snack/meal on the plane.   The Scotsman chose the chocolate banana pancakes and they were smothered in a banana caramel sauce which was to DIE for. Absolutely luscious! He left nothing behind and was a member of the clean plate club.   If/when I return to Vegas, i'll certainly Visit Hexx again.",

My husband had something like eggs Benedict eggs with a **delicious sauce ** and sliced potatoes on the bottom. It was completely amazing ...10 out of 10.   We ordered a fruit plate.

That left $15 sliders (2) & ahi tacos. The tacos are a complete embarrassment- must have used tweezers to put them together! Think of a 50 cent coin folded in half & that's is the size of the tacos they brought to our table. So ~ (6) sliders & (2) non-existent tacos ran us Over $60!! And. That's with a Groupon! The service needs a lot of work too. I think they just opened this side of Hexx. (Used to be a candy store)    If you want a good laugh & want to waste some of your money - by all means go there!

    "text": "Hexx was phenomenal. We were seated quickly after receiving a text from the hostess. Our server (Rafael) was in a great mood and gave us a quick run-down of the cocktail menu. We decided to go with the bottomless mimosas, and were not disappointed. They take that \"bottomless\" part very seriously, I think my glass was empty once the entire morning.  For our meal, we ordered the Hexx Benedict and the Steak and Eggs. I had the Steak and Eggs, and they were nothing short of spectacular. The steak was cooked to my liking (medium rare) and the potatoes and eggs were over the top. It also came with an english muffin. Every part of the dish was tasty and the portions were generous but not crazy.  What really nailed down this 5 star experience was Hexx's willingness to accommodate us when we decided we'd like to spend the rest of our morning at the bar. Our server transferred our bottomless mimosas and they let us keep drinking them as we just sat and watched football! Unbelievable. I'll absolutely be back.",

After we were seated the busser brought water and lemon for everyone. We were all excited to begin the bachelorette party and the restaurant seem to provide an amazing setting for that. After the busser brought the water we then waited and waited and waited. We asked the hostess if we could order drinks and still our waiter never came. A few of the girls tried to go to the bar to get a drink and they were turned away. The bartender said that they couldn't order a drink from the bar because we had a table. After waiting about 30 minutes we asked to speak with the manager. The manager never came. After waiting for 45 minutes without any service or at least a drink we all walked out and left. This was a horrible experience!!!",

Wen on a Saturday for brunch and it was packed. They have a decently priced bottomless mimosa for being on the strip. Never once did our mimosa go empty! The food was really good as well. A group of 7 of us went for brunch. Every single person loved their food. I had the Hexx benedict, and it was so good! The scalloped potatoes were very good as was the sauce. Others got the french toast and carrot cake pancakes and said they were very flavorful but not overwhelming. We also got the breakfast croissant and chicken and waffles and they were both amazing. The chicken was super juicy and crunchy. Great location as well right in Paris. Sit outside if you get a chance and you can people watch. Overall this is a great place and would recommend.",

It was a large bib/butter lettuce drizzled with oil and white balsamic which in and of itself was mmmm, but then sprinkled with blue cheese, chocolate nibs and onions.  Just a super interesting and great tasting item.  We also had the jambalaya, which was great.   I had the gin slush drink which was unique and also great.   The banana cream pie was just ok.  It gets high points for having a whipped cream with no sugar on it, but otherwise the quantity of the whipped cream completely covered any banana taste the dish might have had.    A nice spot to enjoy the view and every dish delivers.",

Drink-wise I got the Yellow Ghost which was a Bloody Mary made with a yellow tomato gazpacho. It looked striking but wasn't very flavorful - they could have spiced it up more with some seasoning.   Overall, this restaurant has very good brunch food but my cocktail left something to be desired hence the 4 stars.  On a side note, they do offer bottomless mimosas at breakfast for $20 which is a good deal in Vegas for a nice restaurant.",

I had been to the Sugar Factory during a previous Vegas trip and had realized it had changed restaurants.  My husband and I came on Friday for breakfast, I had the protein omelet, which was delicious, but the home fries were SO good!  Think, whole roasted mini potatoes that are smashed and covered with Parmesan and salt & pepper.  My husband got the 2 egg meal, and raved about his, as well.  We did bottomless mimosas - a steal for $20, and a Bloody Mary.  We're from Wisconsin, so the Bloody Mary is practically the State Drink after Miller Lite, so a Bloody has to be good for me to be impressed.  This was a nice balance of spicy.    Our waitress was Tracee and she is hysterical.  She makes you feel welcome and just seems like the type of waitress who cares about you and wants to make sure you have a good time.  We didn't think we'd have time Saturday morning for a sit down breakfast, but when we did, we brought our entire group with us and asked for Tracee.  Everyone loved her (and their food) and would be back for sure.",

Due to time constraints, we needed to find a good place near the hotel to eat and selected HEXX because the menu looked the most promising even though the options were limited. Although there were no reservations available online for 5 people at the time we needed, we called and they were able to accommodate us. When we arrived there was a line out the door of people waiting to get in so we were glad we had a reservation. We were seated at a hightop inside where we had a perfect view of the Bellagio's night time fountain show. We were disappointed to learn they were out of both bottles of wine we wanted to order, and it took almost 60 minutes to get our order of 2 burgers, chicken and waffles, caesar salad, and spinach dip. If you're eating anywhere on the strip in Vegas, plan to be there 90 minutes. The chicken and waffles got great reviews, but I thought the bacon cheeseburger was just average. The spinach dip was good and cheesy. Overall, there was nothing special about HEXX other than the view of the Bellagio's fountain, which you'll pay a premium for.",

She was on top of it from the very start!  She suggested the Ghost Pepper bloody mary. DELISH!   Tasted almost like a gazpacho with a kick. Very fresh and unique. You could literally taste every ingredient one by one until that little kick of heat hit the back of your tongue.   Cinnamon Roll waffle! I had to make myself stop eating the yummy cream cheese \"frosting\" by itself after I had finished the perfectly cooked, fluffy, flavorful waffle.  PLUS! They had a bottomless mimosa special for $20! You can't beat that in Vegas! My friend indulged in 4 of them during our leisurely  brunch and said they were STRONG!

Banana Bread French Toast was very good and very filling (ate it for breakfast and lunch) my husband got the best Bloody Mary he's ever had there (Farmers Market Bloody Mary) this could be a meal itself if you eat all the stuff that comes with it! Corned beef hash was just average. The second time I went I got the Protein omelet which was average tasting and price was about $16 (average price here for a breakfast for one entree). Chocolate store has good treats as well while you wait (short wait) for a table. Good atmosphere.",

    "text": "So happy we decided to try this place. Originally, we were supposed to go to Mon Ami Gabi but they had some kind of emergency going on and they weren't serving anyone, so the bf and I decided to go to Hexx instead. Started off with the shrimp cocktail and crab cakes. OMG... best shrimp cocktail I've ever had. 4 Huge, prawn-sized shrimp that required the use of a with a knife and fork. Accompanying cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it. Crab cakes were delish. I'm always hesitant to try crab cakes on the west coast because I'm partial to the ones I've had on the East Coast. These crab cakes did not disappoint. Slight crunch on the exterior and nice ratio of lump crab and filling on he inside. We decided to share the prime-rib sandwich that came with fries. Big portion, tender meat, perfect for sharing. Comes with an au jus to dip and the horseradish to slather on your sandwich. We left stuffed and happy. Best lunch I've had in Vegas by far. We sat outside so we were also able to people watch their outside patio. Next time, we'll come in the evening so we can watch the water show at the Bellagio while dining. Definitely a memorable spot and can't wait for our next trip back to Vegas to try other items on their menu. Thank you to our server, David for the top notch service that made our day so much better.",

I recommend you get out of your comfort zone and try something more adventurous.  The Carnitas Hash was amazing, served in a single dish with the braised pork, a tasty roasted salsa, potatoes, scrambled eggs and pico, it was delicious. The Brioche French Toast was another stand out, my daughter ate it all, and she does not typically clean her plate. Hubs had the Farm Fresh Eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast and not a word of complaint was heard from his side of the table. Our friends tried one of the breakfast pizzas and it looked delicious too.   Service was on point, expeditious without hovering.   All around us people were enjoying some really well decorated Bloody Marys but we weren't quite ready. Maybe next time...",

As Vegas locals, we thought we should check out a renowned Strip location but it was clearly a mistake. If you're looking for a fun brunch experience do not come to this restaurant. Someone rated this as, \"Bottomless will keep your glasses full.\" It was more like our glasses were empty for 80% of our stay.

We had a party of 5 and showed up close to 12am. We were seated quickly and our server came around soon after. We ordered a couple of pizzas, other shared snacks and drinks. Out of the pizza the  Margherita was the best. We also ordered the jungle juice which is served in the pitcher. A bit pricey but it was fun to have.",

The food was incredible, the table split carrot cake pancakes and couldn't get enough. I had chicken and waffles and it was amazing. We enjoyed awesome bloody Mary's and a very generous bottomless mimosa deal. By far our favorite meal in Vegas so far, topped off with Sean having the whole restaurant sing to my sis for her bday! And small detail but nonetheless AWESOME music.",

Not once did we have to ask for a refill on our waters. We left very full and satisfied customers and will be back to see her again!",

    "text": "We dined at Hexx and thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant.  It has an excellent location right on the Strip in front of the Paris resort.  Across the street is the Bellagio Fountains so you can actually see the show while dining.  We had a table that was part way in the restaurant and part way on the patio and it was just perfect.  Far enough away from the sidewalk that people don't stare in at you but close enough to take in the sights.  The restaurant is elevated from the sidewalk level so it is not really a problem if you are seated right on the edge of the patio.  We had a Groupon so our meal was super cheap.  I had a wonderful wood-fired pizza and my husband enjoyed the Classic Burger.  Both meals were tasty and served hot and very flavourful.  Our waitress Jessica A was both attentive and efficient.  We enjoyed our conversation with her sharing her recent baby's birth.  She was lovely and just added to our enjoyment of our evening at Hexx.  We also ordered Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was perfect.  All in all, I would definitely not miss this restaurant when in Vegas.  It is a hidden gem and do check on Groupon if you want to get a deal on dinner.  Also it was super easy to book our reservation through Open Table.  Don't miss this place.  It is great!!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I came to this restaurant after visiting the Eiffel Tower Experience at the Paris Hotel. The food was just ok. I ordered the filet mignon because I wanted a smaller steak. I told the waiter I wanted it well done. He seemed really confused as to why I wanted it well done so I had to explain to him that I'm pregnant and have to have all my meats cooked thoroughly. He then asked if they could butterfly it (when I'm at restaurants and they ask me this it gives me the inclination that they do not have an experienced chef in the kitchen so I usually skip it). But ok, butterfly it. He then tried to convince me to get it with some pink, no! The food took over 30 mins to come out and it was just ok. The roasted asparagus tasted like they picked it fresh out of the ground and slapped in on the plate. The steak was butterflied, but still CHARRED on the edges, yuck. I ate in the center of the steak where it was cooked thoroughly but not burnt. My husband had the chicken and waffles, which he said was good. This is the only reason they got two stars. My advice: use a groupon or go somewhere else.",
