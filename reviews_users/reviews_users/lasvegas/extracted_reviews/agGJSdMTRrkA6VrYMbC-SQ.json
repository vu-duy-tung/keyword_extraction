We've fallen in love with the experience & the food.  Very happy to find a place that we can ALL eat healthy without having an allergic reaction.  I personally like to get the Bento boxes (starting $9) add chicken, steak, fried rice & grilled veggies. Their fried rice is the closest thing I'm used to for REALLY good fried rice.  It's similar to what we're used to on the East Coast. Their sweet garlic sauce is awesome,  but I enjoy the food just how it is.  They have plenty sauces to sample, I usually put a tiny bit in the cup & go up again if I like it. Sweet garlic is my favorite.   The portions are right, priced reasonably & served fresh. Can't wait to go back again. Now we live closer too. I wish these guys the best of luck with their new location. It's a beautiful new atmosphere & centrally located. They deserve it.",

I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely go back to it. We drove from Aliante area to just come and eat here. I heard so many comments about it so I had to try.

Instead got like 5 tiny pieces of broccoli and two cups of brown rice instead. I ordered brown rice as my side expecting it to be a small portion.   Really wanted a nice piece of wild salmon and a big portion of vegetables. Instead got a lot of brown rice and extra carbs for more money spent.   I'm a person really looking for nutrients. And expected that from my ordered. Not paying close to 15$ and getting a bunch of rice instead of vegetables that I told you I wanted as my main. Why am I paying extra and not getting what I wanted. Not rice you pos. Fkin vegetables liked I asked. Gfy. Waste of my time and money.",

I came here one random Friday for lunch because I was craving salmon and well, ya girl spent $13 for a lunch combo. I mean, I don't know about you, maybe I'm just sortakinda poor but that is a pretty steep price for me. A bento was already $9.49 for one protein, rice, noodles & salad but because I ordered salmon, $3 was added on top of that price. Three freaking dollars.. for a small piece of salmon. The salmon was seasoned alright but became more flavorful with the sweet teriyaki sauce from the sauce bar (which, btw, is pretty epic). After finishing the salmon with a couple of bites, I was left with so much rice, noodles and salad. $13 did not feel worth it anymore.  I'm not going to argue with the quality and taste of the food. I've had their steak & it was tasty! The customer service is also great and the sauce bar is awesome. Though we are a small group, I would have to agree with a few Yelpers here.. the prices are pretty crazy which makes this place just A-OK.",

Got the bento box with chicken and wild caught salmon (I won't eat farm raised), which was a treat.  It was actually too much food and I left half of the rice.  The proteins were perfectly prepared. The brown rice was a little more wet than I prefer, but they just opened for the day and probably don't want the rice to dry out.  Also got the spring rolls, which were wrapped like an egg roll. It was a little mushy inside, but tasty.   Will try the veggies and grilled Japanese rice next time.   Also tried 3 sauces, hot lava (amazing and lived up to the name), hot mustard (not mustardy enough), and ponzu sauce (not enough vinegar).  But really really happy overall and I will be back.  Also it was clean and liked the staff.",

The chicken is now sliced and covered in a disgusting mustard tasting sauce and no longer delightful chunks of deliciousness. The steak has declined in taste and in obvious grade of quality. The portions too have waned into tiny bits and are no more than 1oz per meat ordered. Seriously got 3 tiny shrimps, and I could count the tiny meat pieces on one hand. To top it off the rest of the food was bland, under seasoned and just not tasty. I was with 4 people and they all felt the same way. Finally, the cleanliness of the place was GROSS. Sticky tables and surfaces, glass sneeze guard above sauces looked like someone blew their nose on it and then smeared it around. This is no longer on my list of go to's, sorry guys but instead of cutting corners you should be spending more money and time on your concept, your food and your customers.",

Anyway, I used to come here quite often after a good workout.   The food itself is pretty healthy since they don't add sauce to anything. You can choose your own dipping sauce and they have plenty to choose from - anything from creamy to whatever you call sauces that are the opposite of creamy... lol I like that they have different proteins such as chicken, steak, shrimp, etc!   I'm not quite sure why I stopped going to this place but it's a really good healthy option compared to the rest of the places around. From what I remember, service is fine but it's only to the extent of placing your order (I think but I could definitely be wrong).",

I also ordered a small macaroni salad and my bill was 31 dollars? Besides the price which is never a big deal to me the food wasn't anything special. I ordered 2 proteins vegetables and white rice. I had about 3-4 bites of white rice before it was gone? It was also pretty hard. In their defense it was about 7:40 and I know they close at 8 so it's probably just the end but still for paying those prices it should of been a little more fresh. Now this was just a bad experience and there usually really good to me but still very disappointed and probably won't be returning.",

I tried it and wasn't impressed.  Restaurant was empty other than one family there, not surprised.  Only 3 types of meats were available that didn't have a \"premium\" charge.  I opted-in for two meats, one of them being the premium salmon I had to pay more for.  The salmon was no bigger than 3oz and the size of a standard golf ball.  The stir-fried veggies it came with were good, but nothing to write home about.  I will say the sauces you can help yourself to are excellent.  Food was overall okay, but, can't justify the $15 I spent on my plate plus an additional plate I bought.  For spending over $30, its definitely not worth the money with the average food and high prices with small portions.  With so many food options in Las Vegas, find somewhere else to eat.",

Living by this place for 2 years now and I've thought it was a hibachi place like ohjah or Benihana. Nope! It's more like a fast & fresh place.   Being that this was my first time, and clearly not what I was expecting to eat, I stared at the menu for a good 5+min. It would have been helpful to have someone ask if it was my first time and maybe explain the menu a little to me. Also, even though it was close to closing time, all of the tables were dirty. Gotta keep up on that!  I ended up settling with a bento box with the steak, katsu, noodles, salad, and spring rolls. First off, the food is really good. No question about me coming back there. The steak was so tender that it had the same taste and feel to what I was expecting at a hibachi. The only thing is that there were sauces in a thing up front. I didn't realize those were sauces for customers to grab at random. I had walked by then and ate my whole meal thinking \"man, some good sauce would top this\". That's something that could have been avoided by someone explaining how the place worked.   Last thing, and not really a negative, but the sliding door confused me lol. It took me a second to realize there was no handle. However, this is genius! Why don't every place do this?!",

I got the fried rice and chicken, and my co worker got brown rice and steak. He really enjoyed his food, and mine was so good. The chicken and rice was so flavorful and seasoned perfectly. I ordered it for lunch again today because I really wanted a good meal. Thanks Theresa for helping us with our order! Volcano Grille, YOU ROCK",

    "text": "This past weekend we tried Volcano Grille for the first time. The food was very enjoyable and the dining experience casual & relaxing.   My Hubby & I both had a bento box--I had shrimp, brown rice, yakisoba noodles and grilled veggies. With the exception of the shrimp, the portions were generous especially the rice--looked about two cups! The shrimp was an additional cost so I was surprised to only get 5 of them but they were well seasoned and delicious.  My Hubby got the certified angus beef, chicken, rice and yakisoba noodles. I tasted the beef & chicken and was very impressed at how tender the beef was as well as the chicken. The bento box also came with seasoned cucumbers which I thoroughly enjoyed. They also have an extensive sauce bar but as usual, after trying a few of the sauces, I migrated back to my favorite hot mustard.   I'm certain that if Volcano Grille wasn't so far from us we'd certainly partake more often but I know if we're on that side of town it's certainly top of our list at this point.",

Usually when you go to teriyaki places the chicken is kind of bland but the teriyaki adds the flavor to it, but their chicken was different. It had some kind of sauteed garlic mixture on top that made it so flavorful. The beef was tender and cooked perfectly. My favorite part was the sauce bar because I am one to overdo it when it comes to using sauce on my food lol. I mixed the spicy teriyaki with the hot lava, mixed the sweet garlic with ginger and had the hot magma sauce solo. Goddamn was it good lol.

My wife loves mixing sauces up and I liked the spicy ones. But they weren't abrasive in spiciness, I mean if you call something \"lava\" it should be fucking hot and spicy.

I ordered the Bento Box ($9) which comes with your choice of two proteins and two sides (with a small portion of pickled cucumber, like a small salad for your meal) and a regular drink, total came to $11.66. When I received my food it did look a tad small but looks can be deceiving! I was stuffed! Portions were very filling.   An added bonus was their sauce bar, taste buds galore! I tried the Hot Lava and Wasabi sauces. I'm a spicy advocate but the Lava was no where near spicy to me but it was delicious. The Wasabi didn't leave an after sting which was refreshing for me.  I intend to return here to try out their beef and other sauces! Keep up the good work guys!",

The food came out and was the portion size was exceptionally small compared to our previous visits. We asked the server who acknowledged it too. The server went to the young chef who said the portion size was fine and returned the meals to us looking a little embarrassed. Won't be going back now as awful customer service and for 30 dollars this is not worth it",

One good thing about this spot is that the menu is so simple.  (Please keep it this way!) Easy ordering and price is reasonable.   Service was quick, Juliet upfront brought the food over in less than 10 mins. The sauce bar is ridiculous, wish I got to try them all but Spicy Teriyaki did the job.   Food was great and plenty.  Portions well enough for two meals. I definitely recommend Volcano Grille for your quick-stop somewhat healthy-food stop in the Southwest.",

I love what they're doing with their sauces though! They have a whole setup of different sauces you can choose from just for your bento. I got the ponzu sauce and Japanese salsa for my poke and salmon. So when you order you can choose which bento you want, ranging from what you get on the bento. I got the big bento so I chose 2 sides and 2 proteins, only problem I had was that the only proteins that you can get with the bento without paying extra was just for chicken. Other than that all the other proteins like steak, salmon, or even poke was like $2.50 extra!! Omg so my order would come out to $15 total since the big bento is $10 and the two meats I chose was poke and salmon. I thought that was a little ridiculous until I tried the meats and the quality was actually very good so I mean the extra $5 was kinda worth it. It's still kinda expensive though so I wouldn't see myself eating here everyday, but 4 stars overall in my opinion.",

While I understand the extra charge for seafood is common in most places I would expect a little more when you're paying a \"premium.\"  Other than the shrimp stinginess the food is delicious and I would go back again.",

They were playing some old school jams definitely loved the ambience not too loud and not too bright inside.  The hostess was amazing and friendly as were all the chefs!   Their menu is pretty simple pick between a lunch bowl, bowl, a 2 item bento box and a 3 item bento box.  You pick your proteins and sides.  They have a sauce bar for all the added goodies.  The food is sit down or take out and the wait wasn't long at all.  It was a little pricey $41 for two people without drinks but between girlfriend and I we both had 2 salmon, 2 shrimp and a steak those are extra not covered in bento box cost.  The portions were just right I wasn't starving after and I wasn't feeling stuffed.  We are definitely coming back.",

    "text": "A friend told me to meet him here after working out so I did. Healthy option for people trying to stay fit, new year new me type of deal especially being seated almost near EoS fitness ( a gym I sometimes go to if a friend is going).  First off, customer service. Greeted with a nice, \"Hello, how is it going?.\"  Warm vibes to start. Awesome.  Ordering food I got excited cause I saw they had a variety of combinations such as chicken Katsu, steak, teriyaki chicken etc. I chose the katsu and the steak for some extra amount.  Love the idea of having the sauces out just like in a taco shop like Roberto's or lauritas, but they had a few different sauces such as the Katsu sauce of course and a few different types of salsa( I can't quite remember all the sauces they had), but they were pretty good with my meal, cause my meal needed it.  Katsu was layered on top and it was alright. Dry for the most part so the sauces on the self serve came in handy. The steak was a bit overcooked. Came in chewy. Portion wise it was really small compared to some (one of them being makai). Finished it but was still feeling hungry and usually at the latter, I have some to go.  Overall nice concept on fitting in and being a healthy to go spot. Main stars for the sauces and the customer service.",

Constant new staff who could seem to care less about the quality of the food they serve. Seems like food quality drops and prices go up at the same time. People who answer the phone for take out orders are less than qualified to answer phones for a business.  The 3 times I have called on seperate occasions were answered with a \"hello\"! Sorry to give this review as we have stuck with this place for years..but it is now..OFF THE LIST after our last takeout order.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I made plans specifically to visit this Volcano Grill. I've been looking for a place worth visit for bento boxes and the only ones that really offers them are sushi places. So I was thrilled to see that there was a restaurant solely for bento.   A lot of features from this place seemed to be off-putting to me. For starters, the meals are so expensive for the mediocre flavor and portions. I felt they went on the cheaper side of things and hoped they take off from such dirty business.   First off, I ordered a regular bento box which included one protein and two sides. This comes with salad by the way. I got the salmon which costs extra, of course. As for my two sides, I got the Grilled rice which was basically fried rice and grilled vegetables. My salmon was cut in the shape of a fish which was creative but at the same time, I felt like it was off-putting. I'm trying to avoid the thought that I'm eating another animal so having reminded that it used to be a fish in the same shape kind of made me loss my appetite. At the same time, I thought about the scraps of fish that could've been on my plate instead of a cheesy-looking fish. The flavor was delicious but that was it. The portion of the rice along with the veges did not mix well. Also I got salad with it which was a bit of an overkill when it comes to veges.   My girlfriend got the bigger size of bento because she's a hungry hippo :P With the presentation, she was less than impressed. Three egg rolls badly placed on the plate so there was lots of room to play around with. The rice was a tad bit bland. And the chicken Katsu was not notable enough for another visit. For the price we paid for, I think we deserved some drinks along with it.   This isn't your regular sit down restaurant where someone waits on you. The food is ordered at the counter and deliver to your table. The service was average but friendly. Nonetheless, it was a nice try but nothing here won me over.",

    "text": "Much like Fix8 Fitness Cafe in Henderson, this is a spot that focuses on real food prepared with flavor- bonus points for making it so easy to customize for a low-carb diet! Food is fresh, staff is friendly, and they have a sauce bar with 10 different options to add to your dish.  The Bento Box is my go-to, with the choice of two proteins and two sides. The chicken is far from standard here, and the ample portion has a nice grilled char to it. Even better than that is the garlic shrimp, which is well worth the surcharge- almost as good as making it myself! As for the sides: grilled veggies have good variety and I love the dressing on the side salad.  If you're tired of cooking healthy at home, branch out and try Volcano Grille! Once you find the dish you like, it'll be hard to resist coming back frequently. I'll be back to try the gyoza and tofu!",

    "text": "Customer service was meh and the R&B playlist sounded like it belonged to some heartbroken girl but man oh man was my tofu yakisoba bowl tasty! I decided to try out Volcano Grille before a painting session at nearby Design and Dine because I wanted some REAL food that I could enjoy in peace. Plus, I've had this place bookmarked for a while. The extremely affordable bowl option, which includes 1 protein and 1 rice or noodle and the option of veggies, is what sealed the deal for me.   TOFU YAKISOBA BOWL W/VEGGIES ($6.99): Can someone please tell me how to cook tofu like Volcano Grille? Seriously, this is some of the tastiest tofu I've ever had in my life (and I eat a lot of tofu). It was seasoned and cooked to a perfect texture that made it easily sliceable with a plastic fork. I loved the spread of colorful fresh veggies in the bowl - red bell peppers, broccoli, green onions, carrots, and white onions, oh my! I added a cup of spicy teriyaki sauce from the sauce bar for an extra kick. The serving size was just the right portion.   VIBE: Volcano Grille is like a more authentic version of Teriyaki Madness. Same concept though - a quick serve restaurant where you order at the counter and help yourself to fountain drinks and tableware.   Worth a Return Visit? If I'm in the area, I would definitely eat here again.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #191",

I chose one of their premium meats, spicy chicken with brown rice and grilled vegetables as my side. They have a lot of side options too rather than your standard rice and veggies. (Free gyoza with Yelp check in too hehehe). I like to think of myself as a sauce connoisseur so you can imagine how thrilled I was when I saw their plethora of sauces. They have spicy teriyaki, Japanese salsa, yum yum, ponzu and more. I got the spicy teriyaki and ponzu which complimented my protein bowl perfectly. Major plus is they have one of those high tech soda machines where you can pick any type of soda and with flavorings.. you don't see that everywhere! Another plus was the customer service. Can't wait to go back.",

There should be more, and they should take after Volcano Grill... or better yet, VG should expand!  Easy menu.  Healthy options.  Nice decor.  Fresh & authentic flavor.  There were just two little things that got to me: (1) Prices seemed a tad high for the portions given - but it wasn't critical, it's like paying for quality instead of quality (2) The location is all the way in the small Southwest corner of Vegas - I only found this place because the grub at Ikea looks like dog food  I'll definitely come back again, but dunno when.

This was my first time trying this place and I was pretty pumped for it considering all the glowing reviews..  Positives-  - That Angus beef is the shizz! Freshly cooked, tender and juicy! - service was friendly - Didn't eat in, but the restaurant was small but cozy and clean - Did I mention the Angus beef was tasty as flock!  Meh-  -I decided to try a bowl with Angus beef with Japanese brown rice with NO vegetables. Check out the pics to see what I got when I got home. Seriously, this is annoying. It was on my receipt and the girl repeated it back to me. So why do I have a bowl that is 1/3 veggies?? - honestly did not care for the rice. maybe I am spoiled by homemade jasmine rice daily (Thank you Mama!), but this tasted a bit stiff. - Kinda pricey. I grabbed the bowl, an extra side of Angus beef, and 4 gyoza (beef pot stickers essentially) and that ran me a little north of $18. No drink at all, since I took it to go. Damn. I just finished all of it and I'm not even full!  -the gyoza were ok. Just ok. Not the best I've ever had. Not the worst I've ever had. Somewhere in the middle.  I really wanted to like this place, but this experience left me feeling underwhelmed. I did love the taste of the meat, but with so many other options in the area, I don't see a return visit any time in the foreseeable future.   I considered a 2 star review, but that Angus beef bumped it up to 3. Who knows? maybe I'll try the place one more time down the road...maybe..  3 stars.",

Neither is the $2.99 for the spring rolls.  The frozen salmon that you can get from Walmart is bigger than the one in the bento.  The biggest section in the bento box was occupied by the salad & not the main entree. They had a sauce bar which was a \"sure I'll try that\" afterthought for me, but totally just a space filler on the counter.  To end on a positive note, the rice was cooked well & so was the noodles.  (See photos for reference) I am not going back.  There are other places to spend your $20.",

Turns out it is quite close to our stomping grounds, but we'd better be careful we don't aggravate the 'volcano'  Small and sort of what I expected, they do have a mini 'freestyle' soda machine so you can get a lot of yummy drinks with flavors.  You can get a lot of food here and a basic bowl starts at $10~ and goes up from there when you add premium proteins like shrimp tempura, beef, etc.  Basic proteins are chicken katsu, chicken, tofu, and vegetables.  Plates and bowls come with sides that can be grilled rice which is like a fried rice and yakisoba.  Then you can pick other sides like gyoza or egg rolls.  Service was friendly and what I DO love about it is how you can watch the chefs cook the food and they can cook it to order so if you don't want onions in the yakisoba, you can ask for that and they will make it happen, hence the 4 stars.  Also they have an extensive sauce bar with yummy sauce, various teriyaki, ponzu, chili/magma, and wasabi to name a few.  Good amount of seating and looks like it would be comfortable.  I think for when you had a grab all/bowl full of your Asian flavor favorites, this would be a nice go to especially when you want a quick but freshly prepared hot meal.  I would return.",

I am disappointed to find out that they had 25% off today for Mother's Day and me being a new mom celebrating my first Mother's Day, I would think that that offer would apply to me.... they did not mention this deal at all. Plus! They were completely out of ice in their machine. Not a great first experience.",

From my exam room I could hear the music slightly and it peaked me interest. After I was finished with my appointment the good smell of food was in the air and invited me in. I loved the fact their menu had a lot of protein and side choices.  I picked a plate with 2 proteins and two sides.   I tried the Chicken Katsu and the Spicy Garlic Filet Mignon with Grilled Vegetables and Yakisoba noodles. Did I say YUM yet? The Chicken Katsu was perfectly moist on the inside with a perfectly crispy outside. Just the way I like it. The Spicy garlic filet mignon was extremely delicious as well. The veggies were grilled to the perfect temperature, not too raw and not too soft.  My husband also ordered the same two proteins plus the shrimp and Gyoza Chicken dumplings. Everything was delicious! They also have a sauce bar which is awesome, got to try a few of their sauces and they were really good.   They have a fun atmosphere that welcomes you in, and I liked the music variation as well. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area (and even if you're not). Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly, I cannot wait to try more things from them!",

Only one missing was a bbq/ketchup type katsu sauce but there were plenty of others to choose from. I will definitely be back!

I had chicken katsu with no sauce, egg rolls with no sauce, and gyoza with no sauce. Only after I realize they charge you extra for all the sauces that are essential to the food? Also, no utensils or napkins given. Definitely not worth the price. Good quality though but I'm better off ordering takeout/delivery from a sushi restaurant next time.",

It shouldn't cost an extra 60 cents- especially when chicken is the only protein that's not \"premium\".",

Then finished off with the beef this was actually decent wasn't dry like the others  Everything is pretty bland They give you a choice of 6 different sauces when you order But I was a quite confused what they were cause there really isn't no description? I had also had some sides I had chose noodles , gyoza , macaroni salad And also a ginger salad In all in all the food wasn't bad ?

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Volcano Grille ever since they moved to this location and finally did yesterday for lunch. Went in and saw only 3 other people (around 12:30) in there and decided to have it to go. I ordered the big bento with two protein (beef and shrimp) and two sides (fried rice and yakisoba), everything had a lot of black pepper in it. The beef and shrimp were both extra charge on top of the base $10+ for the \"Big Bento\". I could only see that chicken did not have any extra costs to it but salmon and poke both having to pay extra for also. Why all the extra charge for their protein items, I don't get it. The food was okay but very bland. The only thing that really stood out was their use of black pepper in all the food I had (beef, shrimp, fried rice, and yakisoba)   My lunch came out to $18+ with a regular drink, not crazy but did not feel it was worth it. Good thing they have all those sauces to add flavor to the food but overall I did not enjoy it. They do give you a good portion of fried rice and yakisoba, but I just did not eat it due to lack of seasoning and did not want to pour sauces over rice and noodles, ended it up wasting food. The beef was tender and the shrimps were okay but I think T. Madness right around the corner would have been a better choice.",

So first you have several options where you get to choice a protein or 2 and a side or 2. Like a bento box or a bowl. They have Angus beef,shrimp,tempura shrimp,chicken, tofu and  a couple other options. They have several sides of rice and noodles. Their sauce bar is what seems like endless because  there are so many amazing flavors. Some were spicy some were sweet but all equally delicious!!! Loves the fried rice, the shrimp, shrimp tempura, and the spring rolls. Delicious, fast, and reasonably priced.",

Since they've moved to this new location, the food quality has gone downhill. It seems like they pre-cook the fried rice and vegetables and re-warm them when you order. They used to cook every order fresh. I ordered the chicken with fried rice and vegetables. The dish was warm and the vegetables were soggy. How can that be if it were cooked fresh?  I hope the 2 guys running the place realize that getting the food out faster isn't always better. Please go back to the method that got you there in the first place.",

Yeah, sure it was my fault for (possibly leaving it). I called the place to ask if I left an ID there and the employee was on it and said sure i'll check. Minutes go by and she's like \"what can I get for you?\" And I just repeated myself, wondering what's been happening the whole time I'm on hold. She said \"can you just call back later we're kinda busy right now.\" They just opened, but fine if you are busy right now, don't tell me \"sure i'll check\" and come back to me with \"what can I get for you?\" YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT IN THE BEGINNING, so no time is wasted. She didn't even bother lying, you could have said YES or NO, regardless if you really checked or not and that would have been a better answer than being CLUELESS.  The only reason why I didn't bother is because I have already requested a new one, but would like to know where the one I lost was. I have worked in a restaurant and people leave ID's, it's nothing new...",

What I like about this restaurant is that you are able to try a little piece of everything all in one bowl. You can build your own bowl. A medium bowl  consists of 2 proteins, rice or noodles, and 2 sides. I also like how they have a variety of sauces to choose from. I suggest trying the sauces first before filling a whole plastic container of it and committing to a sauce you don't like. The best sauce is the Fuji Yummy! This place is great for lunch and dinner. Their service is fast and friendly, will definitely dine here again!",

There were a few things that stood out. So the servers are the same ppl who took your order...i.e. handling your cash, cash register and did not wash their hands. I made it aware to the manager.  Next food: food was a hit and miss. Chicken katsu was good...they \"spicy\" was sweet. Shrimp was 4 pcs but good. Disappointments are spring rolls. Had on veggie, small and some nasty cream.  Chicken potstickers weren't good at all to include cold. Rice was good and presentation decen, colorful. For the bowl it was a fair serving size but disappointing on shrimp. Bathrooms and leading into was not best presentation in. Lack of paint makes it appear dirty. A very small place that 8 of us felt like we took over the place. Good place to try but not sure I would be eager to return.",

But OH MY GOD, didn't this place just change my mind? Absolutely flavorful everything!   The place itself didn't catch my eyes, it's a fairly unsalted layout and not really decorated. I remember thinking \"uh, oh\" when I first walked in. They also lack in functionality if you have a baby, as they don't have a changing station in the (well sized) bathroom.   Now, the food...Yes, they nailed it.  They have a somewhat decent menu as far as options goes. It's cheap too so totally worth trying it.  I became a regular, and my favorite thing to order is their 2 proteins option.  I always order angus beef, which is very very soft, and choose fried rice. Their fried rice is something else, amazing stuff! I also add tofu as my second protein and add gyoza as one of my sides. I normally ask if I can have macaroni salad instead of another of their sides listed and they're always happy to make the change.  All that deliciousness plus a drink comes out to aprox $14. Not bad!",

Since it's so close by our house, and I work from home, I'll be trying their $6-7 lunch bowl during the weekdays for sure.   Volcano Grill gives you the options of a bowl, plate or burrito. Then you can choose your fillings and sides. There's a bunch of good options, and everything is jam-packed with flavor. So far, I've had a couple plates with tofu and vegetable protein options, paired with either brown rice or noodles, and sides of macaroni salad, seaweed, and the strawberry miso salad. The only thing I don't recommend is the strawberry miso salad - there are no actual strawberries in it; it's just a strawberry ingredient within the dressing. Everything else is great though. And they're fast!   Maybe I'll even go back today. I've been wanting to see the difference in the burrito version too. They offer a lot of unique sauces as well.",

You can order on the app very easily.  I usually get the lunch bowl special or the 2 protein bento box.  I get the steak which is always amazing, the ginger salad, and the grilled rice!  The grilled rice is to die for.. if it's a good day.  It's not always consistent which is why I gave it 4/5 stars.  90% of the time the rice is on point but there have been a few occasions where I could tell it wasn't the same.    I am a sauce queen so I truly enjoy their sauce bar!  The yum yum is the way to go!    Overall I truly enjoy Volcano grill and will continue to use them for my healthy to go order option!",

    "text": "Introduction:  Tried this place a few days ago for the first time.  Thought the name of the place was pretty catchy, just sounded tasty for soms reasons.  Quality: 4/5 I had the Bento box and tasty it was.  I mean, not orgasmically exceptional, but definitely above average. It was a treat when you least expected it.  Cleanliness: 4/5 It was clean and organized, but not quite immaculate. 4 is a fair rating.  Quantity: 4/5 You get a lot, I barely finished half of my Bento box.  I think enough for two, depending on how big your appetite is at that moment. I wasn't too hungry.  Price: 4/5 It was actually a decent price for what is being provided.  However, just keep an eye out on what type of proteins you ordered.  An extra dollar charge here and there will add up.  Upgrade charging applies.  Atmosphere: 3/5 There was nothing spectacular, but also, nothing that will annoy you. Just like the living room at your house. Feels good, but nothing to WOW or Whoo Hoo about.  Customer Service: 3/5 Meet expectations, not too friendly, certainly not rude. To me, in order to get a 4 or 5 stars in this category, an individual needs to know how to build rapport.   For example, asking someone how their days are, wishing them Merry Christmas, Happy New, etc. You know, the basic 101 rapport building behaviors. Anyway, this individual got a 3. At least she wasn't rude or appeared annoyed that she has to work. Just kinda robotic, I am here to serve, nothing more, nothing less. Hopefully, she'll have some color on my next visit.  Tips: I will definitely be back, will it be a place that I would come weekly? Maybe not, but definitely in my once a month or quarterly category.  Like Pei Wei.",

    "text": "My son had been raving about how good this place is for awhile now and he finally took me here and he was right! It's a build your own bowl concept and you choose your protein, rice or noodles, side and salad. The prices vary depending on how many & what type of proteins you choose. The lunch bowl is $7.50 and is available all day! The portions are pretty big too. I ordered the lunch bowl with filet mignon for my protein , noodles, seaweed chuka for my side and the miso strawberry salad. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The noodles were very tasty and there was a lot of it! The seaweed was very good and I am picky about my seaweed salads! The miso strawberry salad was very good as well - the dressing was tasty and I loved the crunchy wonton topping. The entire bowl was full! My son ordered the lunch bowl with filet mignon for protein, fried rice, gyoza for side and macaroni salad. The fried rice had mixed veggies and seasoned very well. The filet mignon again was cooked perfectly. The gyoza was filled with chicken and it was a bit tough to chew. As for the macaroni salad - it lacked flavor for me. In my opinion both were just okay and won't order again. There is a sauce bar with a lot of different ones to choose from. The hot magma was one of my faves. I can't wait to take the hubby here! I definitely wanna try some more proteins and sides and sauces too! So glad it's close to home too which could be both good and bad ; )",

I got an order of potstickers free from the yelp app. I waited less than 10 mins for food and I Loved all the sauces they have- the wasabi and hot  magma were my fave. Food was tasty- I got a lot of katsu chicken, not the same portion on the shrimp and I paid extra for those, so that was a little odd. Overall I thought it was decent for the price and speed. I would suggest they create a few chefs or fan fave combos suggestions because there is so much to pick from. It took me longer to decide what I want than my food took to come out because there's just so many options and combinations you could come up with- as a first timer I felt overwhelmed",

When you walk you go straight to the cashier to order and there's an area next to the cashier with a bunch of different sauces which I thought was cool.   I ordered the lunch special with yakiaona noodles, premium salmon which was $1.99 extra, and a spring roll (which was really an egg roll). Also, if you check in on Yelp you either get a free drink or some free gyoza.   Overall, I liked the food and the amount in the lunch special was good enough for me to finish the whole meal. I thought it was weird that there was no where to throw our trash away, but the cashier told us to leave our finished dishes there and she'd be the one to clean it later.",

    "text": "I final got around to another bookmark off my list. So much so decided to come again try more of the different sauces. The sauces are by FAR the signature for Volcano Grille that will leave lasting impression whether good or bad. In bigger picture look at the menu it your basic healthy protein, choice of sides, and most part reasonable priced. The thing that became fan on my first visit lead to next week another visit. Not only choice of sauces (honest on my first visit the gentlemen never really gave me the heads up; thankfully read some yelp reviews figure out you just pour any sauces want in dixie cup and enjoy) but choice of protein chicken one visit and second angus beef both cooked spot on, LOVE the mixed vegetables choice (I had been too many teriyaki madness style places in life; the worst part is looking at the assorted vegetable amounts to boiled carrots, maybe broccoli, and cabbage NO flavor) nice selection from roasted red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and think onion also all of the options have nice grill marks well seasoned and perfect compliment for healthy meal. The starch have brown rice but so not fan of brown rice in general stuck with my white rice action. The diversity comes not only to the sauce but choices of protein (chicken, angus beef, shrimp tempura, tofu, and more), sides (brown rice, white rice, yakisoba noodles, and more), and just meal from bento box down bowl action. I did both one day bento box comes with two choices of protein and two sides. The bowl another day its one choice of protein, one side, and vegetables come with it. The sauces the first visit tried the spicy teriyaki sauce and the next visit the sweet and tangy sauce. The spicy teriyaki sauce was good! It not much spicy except for some chili flakes but the base teriyaki sauce was good. I felt like not bottle but fresh made. The sweet and tangy was interesting. It had a nice subtle sweetness but well balance with the tangy part or who knows tangy. Lol! I would use that sauce that again bottom line. I believe over 10 sauces so really can go in every day of the week and not have the same sauce!! The thing about the sauces is no extra charge and can get as much as you like.   The decor is nice nothing really bland but nothing that blow your mind. I do like one wall the art work with the whole volcano and almost village below. The menu is right above the counter nice size so easy to read and figure out your options. The service is awesome. I like the music they play in the restaurant modern current upbeat music.",

My only gripe is that I have some food allergies and always ask for a special order. On my last visit I was told they couldn't modify orders anymore which was bizarre because they have always done it in the past without question? As I turned to walk out the server asked me if I had any food allergies to which I replied yes I did. At that point they accommodated me but I shouldn't need to disclose that info in the first place.

You get what you pay for and that's why some things are additional (steak, shrimp, etc.) but it is well worth it. Today we ordered the bento--certified angus steak, grilled shrimp, grilled veggies and Japanese fried rice and a bowl--grilled shrimp, tofu and white rice. The white rice is good but I am definitely getting the Japanese fried rice next time!  There are many things I love about this restaurant. The service is great, the food has no added sauce (there's a sauce bar so you can control the sauciness and the spice), the shrimp is quality (not like the ones in china town...yikes), they have outdoor seating, and taking food to go always makes my co workers jealous ;)",

Now they serve certified angus beef, which is still great, but not as great as the filet.    This is conveniently located at the southwest side of town near 215 and Durango.  This new location is larger and has a more inviting feel than the old location.    I'm a fan of the sauce bar.  Yum Yum and spicy mustard sauce are my favorite.  This is the place to go when you want to go healthy.  They used to have a low carb item on the menu where your plate includes just veggies and protein.  Even though it's not on the menu, you can still opt out the carbs.  You can't go wrong with steak, veggies, and rice.  I would say this is like the fast food version of Benihanas because their food is just as good, but affordable and served fast.    Why go to Benihanas when you can go to your neighborhood Japanese hibachi grill?",

    "text": "VOLCANO GRILLE IS SO YUMMY!! I was lucky enough to find them here on yelp about 2 years ago and have been a regular since. This is Volcano Grille 2.0 with a newer and nicer location as well as some new menu items.    I'm really picky about eating at places that have high food quality, and their food surpasses my expectations. My favorite items are the chicken bowl and omelette roll bowl since I have a smaller appetite, always with fried rice because it is by far the best I've ever had. I also love their steak, even though I'm not big on red meat. It's certified angus beef and you can really taste the difference in how flavorful, tender and juicy it is. Yum!  Don't let this amazing local business pass your radar, you NEED to try it!",

    "text": "Ohhh where do I start on this one? I think I've expressed my three main food groups in other reviews. They're pretty much the culinary path for which I sustain life and the loud screams of the seams stretching in my waistband. When it comes to these food groups I've chosen I'm pretty much an expert (in my mind at least). So when Brittney says she has two choices for lunch this weekend and one of them is tacos, well..... You know where my mind went immediately, Tacos!  Now let's slam on the breaks here and slow the car down a bit. I happened to be sitting at my computer and typed in the other choice I had never heard of. Volcano Grille. Up popped about a million pictures and my jaw hit the keyboard. The power of the camera people. I'll admit I know absolutely zero about Japanese food but what I was looking at was mesmerizing. Sorry 'unnamed' taco shop my mind has been changed.  I had a clear vision of what I wanted to eat, mostly because there was a picture of it on Google Images. I just had no clue how to order it lol. As we walked in through the automatic doors I expressed to my daughter that she knew what I liked so she'd have to order for me. Then I looked up. Low and behold there it was! The exact image I saw on Google! Like an Irish Setter on the hunt I pointed! \"I'll have that!\" Of course 'That' has a name and that name is, 'Amazing.'  Seriously. I've seen a few reviews talking about how there is no perfect score and that they won't write reviews to enhance an establishments reputation, or that some just write to be nice to everyone or something. I really don't know or care about others reviews because I don't read them before I experience any establishment. I look at the rating and then I commit. I want my own genuine reaction. If I don't like it I'm going to say that, If I love it I'm going to say that too.  My reaction to Volcano Grill was that of a kid discovering ice cream and cookies for the first time. Good is just good but the food here was mouthwatering delicious. Alex and I had Bowls, Brittney had a Plate. We all had Yaki Soba noodles and Grilled Rice. For proteins Brittney and I both had Filet Mignon and all three of us had shrimp. Alex's and my shrimp were grilled, Brittney's was tempura. Her and Alex both had Chicken Katsu. We all had grilled vegetables and shared two sides of Gyoza. Wow that's a lot! The price? Surprisingly low for that quality of food.   The explosion of flavors that came from every bite of filet mignon and shrimp is undeniably an experience in itself. I could have sat there like a caveman and just eaten the meat, it was that good. The tempura shrimp was light, fluffy and simply wonderful. The vegetables, the noodles, the Gyoza, all magnificent. There wasn't a bite unenjoyed and if I could have eaten the bowl to savor the flavor I probably would have. The worst part of this experience was leaving. I truly enjoyed Volcano Grille and I know we'll be back for sure.  Check out the video to see just how great they are. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FOv7JTqTIITE&s=433d2c7f0032edee9dc3a6dd564dd720858aceb5d026d6ec51191aca1eacc821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/Ov7JTqTIITE</a>",

    "text": "I really liked this place!  Hubby wanted to check out a new place for us and found The Volcano Grille on Yelp. When we walked into the place, it struck me on how small it first appeared. But I saw that there was a whole row of booths down the side of the restaurant that was adjacent to the kitchen.   We ordered from the cashier, choosing from the menu on the wall behind her.  We found out that if you check-in on Yelp, we could get 2 free goyoza. I mentioned it to the cashier and she happily added them.  Hubby did as well.   I selected the Chicken Lunch Bowl ($7.99) and chose the spring roll, ginger side salad and white steamed rice as the side.  I also chose the small fountain drink.  Husband ordered his meal and will yelp his separately from mine.   Our food was delivered and looked delicious. I was super pleased with how colorful and fresh everything looked. And my gyoza was perfectly crispy, just the way I like it!  The meal was flavorful and satisfying.   The atmosphere of the establishment was obviously Asian and had \"Chinese lanterns \" hung in a portion of the dining area. It added an asian charm I've not seen elsewhere. Perhaps more lanterns could be added throughout the ceiling for a more striking interior?  Like being outside during a lantern launch and it mentally transports you away. Just my 2 cents.   This place is now in my bookmarks as a place to return to.",

    "text": "Fooled again, damn you Instagram!  The pics of the food here look so tantalizing but once again the flavor is completely lacking!  I got a bowl with chicken breast, filet minion, noodles, seaweed salad and grilled veggies.  The chicken was super dry and terribly bland; same with the veggies despite visible grill marks and seasoning; the noodles were doused in a sweet teriaky type sauce that was totally one note; the seaweed salad tastes pretty much the same as when you get it at a sushi restaurant; the filet minion was on point, very tender and flavorful but not worth the almost $2 upgrade especially with the rest of the meal being so disappointing!  There are many sauces to choose from but the majority don't live up to their names and are odd tasting.  The menu set up is simple to read but the only standard meats are chicken breast, chicken katzu, grilled tofu and grilled veggie.  All other proteins, like steak and shrimp, are $1.50-$2 upgrades which really reduced the cost effectiveness of this meal.  The icing on the bland mess is that it was 80-81 degrees in the restaurant the whole time we were in there.  It was almost a releife to go outside!  Overall this place was an over priced, extreme disapoibtment! I'm so glad I didn't make a special trip to try this place as I left sweaty, irritated and profoundly unsatisfied.  I don't think I would eat the small leftovers I have even if I were starving and they were all I had.  Feed your eyes on their Instagram and then go to Makai Grill to satisfy you taste buds and belly!",

It had a good flavor/marinade etc. So we decided to try out the place for lunch today. It looked like you would get more of a larger portion but I was ok with it since it was lunch maybe thats a lunch portion. I ordered the 2 proteins plate,2 sides w fried rice. The other order was a 3 protein. Total-$28. I ordered the filet mignon paid $2.99 extra and \"well done\". I cut open the steak and it was literally rare! Yuck- I could NOT even eat it. So disappointed. I mean theres a huge difference btwn well done & rare I'm not a culinary graduate but come on. I called the restaurant back asked for a manager she didnt get anyone else just took my name down and added it to the \"list of wrong orders\" soo I was still hungry and \"next time\" they would give me a free meal. Ugh. Just doesnt help when you have 1/2 of your lunch inedible.",

I got the plate with 3 proteins and expected more food for the price especially considering I paid extra for the spicy garlic sirloin and to add shrimp. I got barely any shrimp at all and the chicken was quite dry. I was sad about the shrimp because it was actually quite good and so was the steak. The spring rolls were alright, but nothing special. A highlight were all of the sauce options and they were really good. I got the salad with ginger dressing which I also enjoyed.   Overall, I did enjoy the food for the most part. I wish it came with a little more because I got a bunch of chicken and less of the meats I paid extra for. I would give them one more shot, maybe I'll eat there instead of takeout and see if I have a better experience.",

I have been here before but last night I brought my daughter in, as she has never eaten here before. We both ordered the small bowls but there was so much food we brought some food home. We also shared a chocolate molten cake last night too which is one of my favorites here.  Ordering is simple you get to choose your protein, rice or noodles and sides. The filet mignon here is good as well as the chicken katsu and the salmon. You have your choice of brown rice or white rice if you like to choose. My daughter didn't want any rice so she ordered double vegetables which worked out well for her. You can create your bowl the way you want it.  they also have an assortment of house-made sauces which are quite incredible. I love the spicy teriyaki and the wasabi sauce, I used it on everything!   I love the idea that this place is not too far from my house meaning I can stop by quite often and choose different meal combinations. If you haven't tried v8olcano Grille you are missing out!   So much goodness here! Yummm!",

    "text": "Decided to try this place based on good Yelp reviews, and we are glad we did!  The inside is actually pretty spacious with table seating and booths in the back. They have a miniature Coca-Cola freestyle machine!  It doesn't have as many flavors as the larger version, but it's a big upgrade from a basic fountain or, even worse, soda in cans.   Check-in on Yelp for two free gyoza or a free soda.   I tried one of their \"plates\" with three proteins, two sides, a salad, and a rice or noodle. I tried the katsu, grilled chicken, and filet mignon (a slight up-charge for this - I think about $2). I got yakisoba and grilled vegetables as well, but I forget what else (sorry!).   Everything was really good!  The meats were all tender and flavorful, and the katsu was lightly breaded and not overly fried or greasy. I remember everything else was also very good. Of course, I tried the freestyle machine for some vanilla Diet Coke - yum!  The staff were super friendly, and the to-go order took about 15 minutes to be ready.   This is a great dining option for familiar food choices with an asian flair!",

The cashier in the front looks and acts like he hates his life there. Not one smile, not one \"how are you.\" It was one of those conversations where we initiated and asked how he was and his response was, \"good\" .....oh ok I guess the conversation was one sided, typical Vegas!   Don't get the egg rolls they're extra mushy on the inside! Weird feeling in your mouth but not a terrible after taste! The cashier also recommended the strawberry salad, (note: there are no strawberries in the salad) super confusing! The salad looked like a sesame ginger salad which is one of the 3 salad options! But he said if there are wonton strips on top, then it's the strawberry salad! .....I'm still confused, so what makes it a strawberry salad?   Hm...I would come back if I'm too lazy to cook and I'm starving after a workout!",

You're essentially paying a lot more for less at Volcano Grille than say...Ter..... .......  Again food is good. I had the:  Plate combo w/ Filet Mignon, Spicy Garlic Chicken, and Premium Salmon, White Rice, Gyoza, and noodles....you would think that a fat ass like me would be full off all that food but helllll nah. When you can see see a lot of the plate that the food came on, unless the food is rich as fuck you know you ain't getting full.   Besides that....Steak was good, salmon was good, the sauce on the chicken was ehhh, gyoza was ok, noodles were good and the salad it came with (Miso Strawberry) was interestingly good. Another note that I was impressed with was all the sauces that they had in the condiment bar.",

So I chose spicy filet mignon, chicken katsu, shrimp, grilled rice and veggies, egg rolls and also ginger salad.. teriyaki, ginger, and fuji yummy for the sauce.   It sucks that most of the protein costs extra but I like that you get variety for a meal and it was really good. The portion is a good size for someone like me who doesn't eat too much in one sitting so I had left overs. For someone who eats more and/or a guy, I don't think it'd be enough.   The sauces didn't come labeled but it wasn't hard to figure out. I really liked the ginger sauce. The food was delicious but the shrimp and veggies could lay low on the salt a little.   Overall, I think it's worth the price and I would definitely order here again.",

    "text": "This place has been on my wishlist forever. When I got there I decided to go with the plate, which included 3 protein, with rice or noodles, and 2 sides. I went with the spicy chicken katsu, filet mignon, shrimp, yakisoba Noodles, grilled vegetables, and gyoza. With a miso strawberry salad on the side. It was roughly $16 because the spicy Katsu and filet mignon was a protein upgrade. The spicy chicken Katsu was amazing! I love the spicy/sweet sauce it comes with. It was so tasty. The filet mignon was a little dry, which is why it's 4 stars to me, there was a sauce you could get there called the spicy teriyaki sauce, which kind of made up for the dryness of the steak. And I had about 4 tiny pieces of steak. The shrimp wasn't all that flavorful. The yakisoba Noodles were pretty good but I had a tiny portion which was not even close to being enough. The strawberry miso salad was pretty tasty, I liked the strawberry vinaigrette. But THAT SPICY CHICKEN KATSU WAS SOOO GOOD, I would come back just for that. And the spicy teriyaki sauce was amazing! Overall food was 8/10. And the Japanese decor there was pretty interesting. And the staff was sweet and helpful. Oh and don't forget to get mochi ice cream on the way out! It was a nice finishing touch :)",

    "text": "Volcano Grille is the place to go to for fast-casual Japanese grill items on a budget!   A couple highlights first. I love how many sauces they have for you, readily available for you to pour as much as you need, and in a convenient self-serve station...though all of them were a little too sweet for my liking. I was also impressed with how engaging and proactive the services from the staff were...rather hard to come by these days, especially in a fast food kind of set up.  Three of us came in for lunch here since the boss was very positively inclined toward their food. I ordered a lunch bowl. It comes with choice of rice or noodle, salad or other appetizer, and your choice of protein...I opted for Shrimp. One simple bowl with chopsticks and many sauces to choose from...one can be very satisfied, considering the price, for under $7.   The yakisoba style noodles were cooked perfectly chewy, but a bit too sweet for my liking! The salad was fresh, though, again, the dressing was too sweet! In my humble opinion, food, especially in affordable restaurant, can easily hide its True deliciousness behind the sweetness of sauces and preparations in order to please the masses. This is saddening, because there is more potential here that will never be realized.    Everything was convenient here. I love their automatic door. Ordering is easy and simple, with understandable choices. Then get a table and grab a sauce, or five, while you wait for your food. The staff will bring you your order...and even pour more drinks for you, as well as asking you if you need anything, whenever they have a chance. My simple request, if you haven't figured it out yet, just make it less sweet please!  -2018 reviews #29-",

Tonight we decided to stop by their store front and order take-out for dinner. After placing the order, for a family of six our bill was $75.. trying to pay we hit a snag they wouldn't accept a hundred dollar bill.. instead recommended I pay with a card.... huh wait. What?  We were told that \"if the owners were here they may make an exception\".. it's interesting that as a small business they make it hard on themselves to accept someones monies. It isn't like I came in, ordered a coke and then wanted to pay with a Benjamin!  Second snag.., we are waiting for our order to be ready, the person who took our order says \"sorry more bad news, we are out of salad\".. so no big deal we will make other selections for four of the six meals..  Third snag.., lady comes over. She is the one checking orders and bagging orders (hair down to her butt).. not that I am hating on her hair, it's actually beautiful hair. It just wasn't tied up, no hair net, I mean c'mon it's food!! Tie it up.. additionally, she isn't wearing gloves, and she has long faux acrylic nails on.. gross   I'll just stop there.. sad",

Right when you step in your smacked in the face with an amazing aroma.  It definitely grabs your attention immediately. The menu is straight to the point, and very easy to understand, the only problem is you don't know what to order, everything looks and sounds good.  This is definitely a place you need to come back to try everything you want. I normally settle for the Salmon, but have found myself craving the filet mignon, definitely favorite cut. The Yakisoba noodles are always my go to side with Rice. I have a hard time choosing between the fried and white Rice (I love rice) I would recommend trying their Vegan Fried Rice (so much flavor). I also recommend saving room for the dessert, The chocolate Lava Cake is my favorite, I am not a big Matcha fan, but my husband couldn't stop Talking about their Matcha Lava Cake, IG your not a in a Cake kind of mood I definitely recommend grabbing some mochi ice cream, my favorite is alway the chocolate, vanilla, mango and strawberry. i also love that they have a sauce bar, I love thr Japanese salsa and hot magma- it definitely amplifies the food and takes it to another level. I definitely will be back for more and I can't wait to grab another dessert, writing about it has definitely got me craving more!",

There were a few people eating their bentos outside and one other person inside the restaurant. I decided to get the Big Bento and did not realize that some of the proteins were extra charge. No big deal, but it was kind of expensive for average food. I wanted salmon and tofu, but the employee apologized and said that they were out of tofu. So I chose the beef instead, along with brown rice and spring rolls. I waited about 10 minutes for my to go order, but I didn't mind. I like how everything is made to order, unlike places like Panda Express where you never know how long the food has been sitting out.   My food was still hot and fresh when I got home. I really liked the beef. It was tasty, cooked well and delicious! The salmon was alright. I regret not taking home some of the sauces from their sauce bar, which probably would have made it better. However, another customer was taking his sweet time at the sauce bar the entire time I was waiting for my food. I think he took one of everything, LOL. The spring rolls were bland tasting and not recommended.   Overall, customer service was friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I didn't think the food was worth $16, although the beef was pretty good. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other options, but for the price, I can get better food elsewhere.",

It looked like they were cooked in the morning or the day before and kept inside a covered pot until they reheat it to be served.   The chicken also looked precooked and not fresh.   Stay away from the sweet garlic sauce. It makes your breath kick even after flossing, 2x brushes, and mouth washing.   For 10.99... You expect the food to be fresh because teriyaki grill is one building down and offers fresh food for less than that.   I hope this review helps",

This restaurant is always the first to pop up and for whatever reason I always ignore it. Until last night!   I'm always looking for something convenient but healthy. I can't believe it took me s OMG to discover this. I ordered a bento box (which is gigantic by the way) and only $10..Japanese grilled rice (fried rice) was so good along with gyoza. All together order time and pickup my husband was back within 15 minutes. New favorite!",

    "text": "UPDATE:  Although this was one of my favorite places to eat, I visited Volcano Grille yesterday and brought 3 new customers with me.  Evidently, the manager and staff are misinformed on laws pertaining to service animals.  I have a physical disability in which I require a service animal.  I was asked for my service dog's ID, which violates the American Disabilities Act.  When I spoke with the manager and showed her the laws pertaining to the ADA, she then told me it would be okay that I stayed but would need to sit away from any other patrons.  Isolation from other patrons is another violation of the ADA.    It has been extremely difficult in the past 3 years adjusting to a new life having CRPS, the most painful condition ever recorded, but feeling as if I am being discriminated against because of it just adds to the difficulties.  Needless to say, I won't be returning to Volcano Grille.  UPDATE:  After posting this review, I was immediately contacted by ownership to apologize and ask how to make this situation right.  The owner agreed to post the laws concerning service animals in his business for all employees to read.  I appreciate the owner's interest in turning a bad situation into a positive one.",

After paying almost $18 for 1 person, I'd would rather drive to Gyukaku on Spring Mtn... This is my first time visiting and probably be my last... Been trying to find my Teriyaki fix since I moved here from Seattle, but found NONE that can compare... The quality of food was mediocre... The taste was mediocre... Yakisoba Overcooked tasted a bit peppered like peppered beef jerky... Gyoza tasted as if it was previously frozen or bought from Costco... Only good tastes were the variety of sauces they provide... Good place to try once, but not something that you would be craving for...  Good Luck!!",

They also have a fully loaded sauce bar for those of you who enjoy that extra kick! The employees were friendly, the atmosphere was super chill and they even play R&B music, so you can't beat that! We will definitely be coming back! This is a great spot for lunch. Great job Volcano Grille!",

After seeing the bento box constantly show up on my facebook feed, I finally got to find out how delicious this place was. I ordered exactly what they have on their facebook ads. The bento box with beef and salmon. I checced out the condiment station and I strongly recommend the Japanese Salsa. Not only was my order done in under 10 minutes but I think my tastebuds had an orgasm!!! Fittingly, the restaurant had H-Town's \"Knoccing The Boots\" playing and that's exactly what my tastebuds did with the bento box. They made extreme passionate, whispering sweet nothings into your ears type of love in my mouth. I will most definitely be coming bacc to this fine establishment.",

When I entered, the place was empty, but not a big deal. I approached the counter and there were several employees at the front, but none of them greeted me or seemed to care that there was a customer there.  But I decided to order a bowl with Angus beef. Specified that I wanted it 'to go'.  While I waited for my food, I perused the sauce bar and ladled a few of them to try.  Then I sat down and waited for my order. One of the employees brought me my order but they neglected to realize that I had wanted it for takeout.  Honest mistake, so no biggie.  When I got home, I was disappointed in the portion size of the bowl. It was almost all rice and veggies and very little actual meat. The beef itself was tender, but I really didn't feel as I got my money's worth.   Loved the sauce bar, but it alone doesn't make me want to come back.",

I recommend the Bento Box $10.49. You get 2 items and 2 sides. There's a decent amount to choose from, although, most of the items you have to pay a little extra (such as the Certified Angus Beef +$2.15, Shrimp +$2.35, Premium Salmon +$2.99, Shrimp Tempura +$1.15). The ones that come at just the bento box are chicken breast, tofu, and grilled vegetables. So most of the stuff are at a little extra charge. I usually get the beef and tofu. Tofu isn't what I expected but still enjoyable nonetheless. The portion for the beef is very small so just a heads up.  In terms of sides, I usually get white japanese rice and grilled veggies. The gyoza in particular is better than expected, so definitely recommend that.  If you don't want the bento box, they also have the $7.99 bowl which gives you 1 choice of protein, and either 1 rice or noodle. I have yet to get that since I prefer the bento box but this is a great option if you're not as hungry.  Service is great. You only interact with the one cashier pretty much and they've always been friendly to me.",

    "text": "Holy COW!!!! What a discovery!! I'm clearly the last person to hear about this place based on the plethora of incredible reviews.   My boyfriend and I came here yesterday for lunch after I scoped it on Yelp. The boyfriend almost* vetoed it, because \"how good can a bento box really be?\"  It can be INCREDIBLE!   He had the steak bento with the salad, brown rice and veggies. I opted for the chicken breast, salad, veggies and brown rice.  The steak here is incredible. Seriously. I know what you're thinking... c'mon Laney, how good could it possibly be? Well... it's tender, not chewy, not stringy, and tastes like the ribeye at Hakkasan. Boom.  The chicken; also fantastic!! It comes cooked in garlic and is all white meat with no chewy-tendon-y pieces.   The brown rice was perfectly cooked, the veggies were fantastic-- not mushy or weird-- super fresh.   Couple the fantastic meal with the fact that they have an entire sauce bar and I'm in my happy place. The sauce bar has teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, spicy mayo, yum yum sauce, creamy miso, wasabi dressing and more.  Some people complain about the pricing at this place, but it's really not that bad! Wouldn't you rather pay a couple dollars extra for an incredible meal, rather than get a cheap crap meal? Life's too short for bad food!  *Will be coming here again, and again, and again!!",

    "text": "This place is my go to for an after school lunch treat. I usually order the bento box and share it with a friend which usually gets us pretty full, but the dessert is what usually fills us up all the way.   I've had the yakisoba, fried rice, chicken, shrimp, beef, mixed veggies, tofu, and salmon. I like to switch it up each time I go. Everything is usually pretty flavorful, but not too salty, which I like. The flavor of the tofu wowed me, I thought it would be pretty flavorless and I would have to add one of their large selection of sauces on top, but surprisingly, I was able to eat it without.   The only part I don't like is that sometimes the food is overly oily. Once we had yakisoba that was sitting in a pile of oil :/ We ate the top half, but left the extra oily noodles on the plate.   I like that they have a variety of sauces that you can play around with. Personally, I like the magma and the yum yum sauce.   Each time I come here, I order their dessert. They only have one option, but it's pretty good. Especially for someone with a sweet tooth. It's a warm chocolate cake/moist brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. The two temperatures combined makes a wonderfully delicious combination. Definitely would recommended those with sweet cravings to try it.",

So there really is only 3 options on the menu but the concept of picking your own protein and side adds a little fun to the process. What I liked however was their \"sauce bar\". They had quite a few different sauces to pick from to add to your meats. My favorite the wasabi sauce, DELICIOUS! The sauce bar definitely made the experience different and worth the trip.",

One, the prices are a little expensive for their protein sides. Their salmon is an up charge of $2, which I don't mind paying for, but I wish I was a bigger cut.

I basically hate the way my husband and most people cook chicken, but here they cut their chicken into bite-sized portions (yes, I am a child who values this) and have amazing fried rice and grilled veggies to pair it with. Their tofu is also a very good option for those who are non-meat inclined, but it doesn't eat the Japanese omelette, which I'm still hoping beyond hope they bring back.   If I'm struggling for where and what to eat and I'm more inclined not to feel sluggish after, but still want that pop of flavor, I'll make my way here for a bento or a BIG bento (two proteins). Ordering ahead is very easy and they are more efficient at this new location. They also play some great RnB music here that the staff, and some customers, will sing along to. The sliding door up front is a bit weird, cause it doesn't open very quickly when you're in front of it, but at least those people ordering massive to go orders get some help on their way out.",

I eat my meat medium rare or close to rare and it was perfect. The chicken was sooooo much better and the shrimp was nice and large. The bento box is so much food and only like $10-$11. Worth it. I must have come in a bad day the first time. I love this place and the owner is very kind for doing this for me.   Ehhh. It was decent. You don't get a lot of food at all so definitely overpriced for the quality and quantity. I wouldn't recommend unless you're in the mood for this place and it's close/you don't want to travel far. Blah. Good service, though.",

You can tell all of the ingredients are high quality and freshness. I've tried the steak, shrimp, tempura shrimp, salmon, and chicken and all have impressed me.   I recently stopped eating rice so I opted for veggies the last time I was there. I was expecting some lettuce, carrots, broccoli, you know the standard steamed veggies. Nope. What I got was a pile of steamed/seared tasty goodness. Seasoned well, shredded carrots and zucchini, with hand cut broccoli and onions.  I always go for the magma sauce with some lava mixed into it. Amazing flavor and not too much heat.  Next time you're in the area, give it a shot. Your stomach will thank you",

This time I opted for the seaweed salad but kept everything else the same. It was close to closing and they were a little busy but not really an excuse to mix up my order and give me beef instead of chicken. I was really looking forward to chicken so I was a little disappointed to find they gave me beef. Was a little too busy and too close to closing time to ask for it to be remade so I ate it anyways. Was ok but nothing bothers me more than having an order mixed up. I always hate to ask especially when you can see it's just a bunch of kids because there's no telling what they are going to do to the food on a remake. I will probably not return for this reason. And, I would suggest that at least one adult be working for supervision.",

I found it on Yelp and it wasn't too far so I decided to give it a try one day for lunch- now I frequent here and bring friends who always end up loving it also. I always get the Big Bento with Chicken and Angus Beef, grilled Japanese rice (essentially fried rice) and yakisoba noodles (essentially chow mein noodles). So so so good! They all come with small cucumbers and an orange peel which ties in a nice, refreshing flavor.   It is a little pricey, especially if you upgrade the proteins at all (The Angus beef is an extra $2.50 I believe) so it ends up being around $15. It's a good portion of food though and the quality seems excellent so I think it's worth it.  & yes- the sauce bar is awesome! I'm a simple girl so I enjoy the spicy teriyaki sauce most, but there are several fun options to choose from.  Just a heads up- they close at 8 pm sharp- even on weekend nights.",

    "text": "I love bento boxes and the fact that you can customize what you want is great. I usually get the angus beef and chicken breast. The meat is cooked perfectly. It's moist and flavorful. Some places you go and the chicken is dried out and chewy. They have a sauce bar which is really cool. I like the spicy teriyaki sauce personally. They have real good dressing for their salads. The best part is its close to my house. The front cashier is awesome. She's so polite and always smiling. The customer service is great!",

I'm not really into these type of food places but this place has me sold!  They also have a wide selection of sauces.    There's also plenty of parking in front of the restaurant.  And the staff is very friendly.  I won't be surprised if I'll be there once a week.",

It is now located on Durango which is much more accessible and basically down the street from where we live!  I have had the bento box and also the bowl and both are super tasty! The chicken and steak are always most preferred but all the meat is delicious!  Basically, if you like teppanyaki style food without having to go to a fancy restaurant you will LOVE this place! The sauces are delicious! (Ginger and mustard ones are my faves).  The only thing I'd wish they could change is their hours! Open a little earlier like 11! We're always hungry for some lunch around that time but sometimes can't wait til 12 to eat.",

The food was decent.  I liked the available options and the flexibility.  Pick two from this group, pick two more from the next.  How hard can that be?

The lady behind the register said it came with plenty of proteins and veggies. First off, it doesn't come with veggies. Worse than that, the portions are so tiny that I was absolutely shocked by their stinginess. I'm talking 5 pieces of shrimp and fewer than 10 chunks of beef. To top it off, their noodles are a complete failure. They are worse than Panda Express noodles. I was lied to by their employee and fell completely ripped off by their kid size portions. My advice, seek another establishment unless you like overpaying, still being hungry, and appreciate being lied to.",

After a while you get used to the smell so you think you don't smell it anymore but it still there. It could be something as simple as covering a floor drain but whatever it is it needs to be addressed I would've given this place five stars but with that smell when you walk in it's the most unappetizing smell. Pricing is not bad because they give you a lot of food however with all the extras it can add up pretty quickly two Bento boxes with two proteins and two sides upgrading to steak and shrimp and chicken and salmon plus one drink came to just under $30. For a quick service concept I feel like that was a little high however the quality was good the food was delicious and I wouldn't mind coming back again to enjoy it. Please fix that smell and I will be there every day",

We get the bento box which is your choice of 4 items and is a great price for the amount of food they give you. Eveything we have ever tasted on the menu has always satisfied us. Oh and they have a sauce bar with some genius sauces. My favorite is the sweet garlic. YUUUMMMM. If youve never tried Volcano Grille I would definitly recommend giving them a shot.
