    "text": "Herbs and Rye is an interesting bar spot amongst its area. The interior serves a 1920's style theme. They're known for their steaks here but I personally didn't find it all that amazing. We ordered the truffle mac n cheese, the carpaccio, the ny ribeye, and to drink I got the pisco sour. The pisco sour was pretty good, with a good mixture amount of alcohol in it to keep me satisfied haha. The steak wasn't all too amazing in my opinion though, we ordered it medium rare, but it was still very plain tasting, tough, and chewy. It was more of a well done cooked steak. The truffle mac n cheese was okay as well but again I didn't feel it was anything special, the carpaccio was also decent but still no fireworks. Over all the prices are a little expensive considering I really didn't feel anything amazing from this place in terms of its food. Our waiter was extremely nice though which made up for it, he was knowledgeable about the drinks and menu and even offered us some nice suggestions we might like base on our taste. I wouldn't mind coming back here as a nice lounge around spot to bar hop for drinks if I am in the mood for a Chicago style prohibition atmosphere bar, but if someone asks me where I want to eat at in the future, unfortunately Herbs and Rye doesn't seem to be the first name that will come to mind.",

    "text": "I think the broken sign and nondescript door all play into the prohibition theme of this restaurant....   A coworker told me about the happy hour here that runs from 5-8pm and 12am-3am....HALF OFF STEAKS! WHAT?!  Now that is my kind of happy hour! The 18oz boneless ribeye was $24 and comes with a side.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly and marbled well with fat.  We tried a few sides since we were with some friends.  Honestly, the sides were underwhelming (jalapeno creamed corn, sweet potato tots, brussel sprouts).  I definitely would not pay the regular price for the sides again.  A few of the appetizers were half price, so we tried the spicy mussels ($13).  The marinara sauce that these mussels come with is addicting, we kept asking for more bread to sop up all the sauce.  The bread is warm, freshly toasted baguette and perfect for soaking up all the garlicky goodness.    Honestly, the price of most of their happy hour items is what I would probably expect to pay normally.  The items on their food menu seem grossly overpriced for this location, so unless you are here for happy hour....I say there are better options.  I highly recommend if you want a good steak and don't want to pay a visit to your cheap steakhouses like Outback, then to come give Herbs and Rye a try.  Also make sure to sit in the bar area, the regular dining area seemed dead.",

My wife got the ribeye and I got the NY Strip, and after having a taste of hers I wish I'd ordered the ribeye. My garlic mashed potatoes were better than my wife's truffle crispy fries (which weren't very crispy, to be honest) but those were still tasty. The littleneck clams appetizer was awesome.   No surprise, the cocktails were dead-on, and the donuts for dessert were freshly made and perfectly cooked.  All in all, I think it was worth the wait. I would bring friends here for drinks, definitely. I'm not sure I would feel so good if I were paying non-Happy Hour prices for the steaks, but with such a long and generous happy hour that's not really a problem.",

My hubby and i had 2 huge steaks and 2 sides for under 60 bucks.  The only disappointment was that we had 5:00 reservations,  (as well as several other patrons),  and we all stood in the 105 degree heat for 15 minutes because they didn't open the doors until 5:15 (even though a sign on the front clearly says happy hour is 5:00-8:00.) When they finally opened the door there was no apology from the hostess, and she didn't even hold the door open.  She just opened it then closed it on everyone.  Despite the bad initial impression,  we will go back for the food.  We will just be sure to go after 5:15.",

Service was great throughout our time here, we even let our waitress choose our second round of drinks. Happy hour was 1/2 off a lot of food items & well drinks. Little pricey so I would take advantage of happy hour. There was 4 of us & our bill was a little over $300. $100 of it being 2 rounds of shots, 2 rounds of cocktails, 2 filets, 2 sides, wedge salad & a flatbreads.. not bad at all. They also gave us a plate of amazing mini donuts for my friends birthday!   Kind of a hole-in-the-wall place.

    "text": "Great drinks...desecrated carpaccio  To whom it may concern,  We visited H&R last night about 8:30 pm. The place was fairly busy; we told the hostess we'd like to sit in the bar, she said \"sure.\" The bar was full but three booths and another table along the wall were open so we sat down. Several minutes went by, the table was not wiped off so we continued to wait, no big deal. After a few more minutes a busser at the next table called out \"hey guys, these tables are only for reservations.\" It wasn't exactly a hello, but at least someone let us know what was going on.  My boyfriend went to see the hostess, to find a table or make a reservation for right then - meanwhile our first server greeted me while the table was cleaned. The hostess and my boyfriend returned, I asked if we're moving or - ? She said, \"it should be fine.\" That's a confusing response from the person in charge of knowing if the table was reserved.   Our drinks were great. The carpaccio was a travesty. Beautiful beef cruelly slathered with balsamic and aioli from squeeze bottles and an inexplicable mountain of arugula in the center. I gave it a chance but it was ruined by so much sauce. I would have let the server know but he never circled back. So we waited.  Our second server came along, removed the carpaccio and explained our first server had left. Both servers were very pleasant, though it would have been better if the first one had checked in on the food. The second server was so professional and gracious we were tempted to stay for another cocktail but decided to call it a night instead.  The visit could've gone better in several respects, so much so that I thought it worth an email. I could not find a direct email so I'm posting my comments here. A negative yelp review is not my first choice, but here we are.  Sincerely, Erin",

    "text": "We had our company Holiday dinner on 12/21/2018 and received the most terrible service I have ever received at a semi/fine dining steakhouse in Las Vegas for a $1,200+ bill considering $255.00 was the gratuity. Our server that was the only female on staff that night could not give a straight answer of what drinks were on happy hour. But, that was the least of the issues. We had 15 people in our party and all ordered at the same time aside from three people and five received their meals while the rest of the table waited over 40 minutes for their food. When we enquired where the food was the waitress said \"Sorry you order was lost in the vortex\"...I don't have words to express professionally what I wanted to say back to her. Finally, when my steak came out which was the filet that I had ordered medium rare it was medium well...closer to just well done. At this point the waitress did apologize and brought one back out cooked properly. Unfortunately, by that point I had waited over an hour and 10 minutes for my meal, and was able to watch everyone around eat aside from the surgeon I work for who also didn't receive his pork shoulder for over an hour. I would highly recommend that unless you're looking for one step up from outback steakhouse you run from this establishment and go to somewhere like Bavette's... With that being said I could've gotten better service and most likely a better steak at Denny's. I have also attempted to speak with management and have had no response. If you are in the area, just get sushi instead.  I am the business owner. I asked my man to try to get a reasonable \"right to the wrongs \" we experienced or make up for the bad service and non disclosures. I give people and businesses a chance to correct mistakes. For a small bill, no problem. This was a ell over a thousand dollars.  I am disappointed for the lack of responsibility and will not return here. V.N.",

If you like a speakeasy kind of vibe with good music, good drinks and steaks you'll like this place! We shared an appetizer, the ribeye and the filet mignon, and two drinks each for about $130. The steaks were great and the service was good as well. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great steak without the Vegas Strip price tag or atmosphere. Will definitely be back.",

Sophisticated, deep flavor, perfectly cooked. After Several try's I will order it a bit on the done side and I usually order rare. This steak is too good to over cook yet the  flavors blend in the way they cook it into the meat.   All others compare to this now.  The first night it was a bit loud, evidence that I am actually in the 'old' category!  Service was great. I would not go in a hurry, this is a place to be enjoyed.",

    "text": "As a vegan, loving a place known for their steaks and Mac and cheese sounds kinda hypocritical. However, this place offers an eclectic cocktail menu, amazing veggie sides, and delicious flat breads for those of us who aren't so crazy about meats and cheeses.   The ambiance... Think brick floors... Red velvet walls... Low lighting and antique chandeliers... Old music from 20s, 30s, and 40s playing with black and white movies on the TVs. I almost felt like I was stepping back in time into a hip and super secret speak easy...   The service was great. We were seated promptly and our waters were never empty. She checked on the table just enough for us to never need anything... But also not feel overwhelmed.   My last experience here was a tad bit underwhelming due to their portion sizes of their sides going down. *thumbs down* However, everything tastes pretty amazing and they were super accommodating to my vegan needs. I ordered the button mushrooms and garlic spinach... Yum! Seasoned to utter perfection and cooked just right... It's definitely a vegan crowd pleaser. My boyfriend and dad ordered huge steaks that came with  sides. My mom ordered a flat bread and a side of mushrooms... Everyone loved their food. They offer half off steaks and certain cocktails for happy hour. I got a great glass of Cabernet for only 8 bucks! :)       They are open late and offer two happy hours... 5-8pm and 12am-close. The parking can be a little tricky but there are plenty of open lots near by:) I'll definitely be returning.",

    "text": "This is a good solid steakhouse and apparently a local favorite. Came here with a group of friends on a Tuesday night for a friend's birthday. Parking is a little tricky cause the lot is small and people just make up their own spots along the wall. Some of my friends had to park in a different lot so that kinda sucked. When you walk in the restaurant has the typical steak house atmosphere... Red walls, chandeliers and dark lighting.   They have an extensive menu with a great bar and eclectic food choices. The double stars on the menu means that it's half off!  How awesome. This includes the steaks, pork chops and some appetizers. When is happy hour? Not really sure but we ordered around 7 to 730 which is prime time for dinner and we got happy hour prices. There were multiple waiters to fill our water cups, get drink orders and serve us basket after basket of bread.  Bread is delicious btw. It's warm and comes with whipped butter.   We had the spicy mussels to share for appetizers. It was delicious. Reminds me of boiling crab but less oily!  We ate all the bread and used it to soak up the yummy garlicky sauce. For half off it was a great deal.   I ordered the ribeye medium rare and my side were Brussels sprouts. The steak was pretty big! It was really charred and crispy on the outside but on the inside it was a perfect medium rare.  The steak was sooo good!!  Juicy, salty, great texture with a slightly crispy outside. My first bite was heaven. The Brussels sprouts were super good too. It was very oily because it had thick cuts of bacon in it. I love Brussels sprouts and it's actually my favorite vegetable so these were great. I also got to try the truffle Mac and cheese and creamed corn. All were really good!  Can't really go wrong.   After our meal we got a digestif. It was like a thick minty herbal syrup. Tasted a little liked chinese. medicine. Not for me but some people like it.   My 18oz delicious juicy steak was 30 bucks. Definitely will come back!!",

    "text": "Have you ever cried deeply into your food because the first bite alone just made you feel like hot butter rolling down a warm ear of freshly grilled corn?   A great restaurant guarantees great food, great ambiance and most of all great service; Herbs & Rye does all of the above and does it with an elegance that is rare to find in Sin City outside of the prestigious Las Vegas Strip. So it is no surprise that Herbs & Rye has an daily average wait time of 55 minutes no matter the time of day (dress warmly as the waiting area is a grand lounging area of one wooden chair). **UPDATE: I WENT BACK 04/2017 AND THEY NOW HAVE A TUFTED BENCH!!**  Regardless, every visit is well worth the three-digit minimum bill, the hunger-game esque hunt for parking, and the inability to fit into any of your clothes the next day. If you are craving a beautiful piece of meat or searching for a new watering hole for your next special occasion, I highly recommend Herbs & Rye aka the only restaurant to make me actively crave brussel sprouts ever. A personal favorite is the filet with an old fashioned and never skimping on the creme brulee.  Plus the 5-8PM happy hour discount will not break the bank.",

So, I got that and truffle fries. I also tried the truffle mac & cheese and the Herbs & Rye House Brew (HH price: $3). The sides aren't included in happy hour. We got beignets to end a great meal.  Bacon-wrapped Filet Mignon: It had two thick slices of bacon on top and not wrapped around the filet. For a piece of steak that would normally be at least $50, getting this at half the price definitely changes everything. It was perfectly medium-rare, tender and juicy. 4.5/5  Truffle Fries: Thin-cut fries with truffles and parmesan cheese. You can taste and see truffles, yay! The fries were crispy. I enjoy truffle fries but what makes this even better is that it's less than $10! 5/5  Truffle Mac & Cheese: After eating great truffle fries, I was disappointed with this mac & cheese. I couldn't taste truffles. It was like regular, plain mac & cheese. 2/5  Beignets: These aren't similar to the famous beignets from New Orleans. These are like mini doughnuts covered in granulated sugar. Normally comes with 2 dipping sauces: white chocolate and caramel but since I don't like white chocolate, our server threw in chocolate sauce. 4/5  The Kool Kids ordered Jack & Coke but it wasn't like Jack & Coke - our server later on said it's not really Jack & Coke, it was something else. That and my not-so-bacon-wrapped bacon-wrapped filet made me think we were getting punked by our server.",

The building that it is in looks a but inconspicuous.  You wouldn't expect it to be as nice as it is from the outside.  Once you walk inside, the decor is classy with dimly lit booths and a Prohibition era decor complete with waiters and bar staff dressed in that time period.  Every time I walk in, it makes me feel like I've stepped in to a time warp and I'm having dinner and drinks in Old Vegas fashion.    A go to must is their happy hour.  All the food that is marked in their menu is half off.  I believe their happy hour is from 5 to 8 and from midnight to close.  I've been here at least 5 times and their steaks are always exceptional.  My bf and I usually share both of our sides. You get one side per entree.  You can pay a little extra for sauces such as their house chimichurri but with a good steak cooked well, its not necessary. Save the extra bucks and try out the various cocktails they have on the menu.",

The truffle mac and cheese was very good! A friend ordered the calamari and I was not a fan. When my truffle penne came, it was absolutely awful. A few people at the table tasted it and agreed it was disgusting. The server offered to have it remade and the second time it came out better. By the time I got it, my friends were done eat so that sucked but I was glad it tasted better. We ordered the doughnuts for dessert which were decent, nothing special. Overall, for all the hype, I thought this place was mediocre but probably wouldn't come back.",

Imagine a dried up pizza with 6 oz of green grass on top. Don't go here for the food, but a good place to mingle after conference. However, their crab cake was ok, and their \"tomatoes flatbread\" was pretty tasty. Still, 2 star for having $22 uneatable filet mignon.",

It seems like they were properly staffed for a weekend and the service showed. I made a reservation for my birthday for 4, the only thing I was a little peeved about was the hostess had a major attitude. I understand I made a reservation at 6pm but when I check in a little early I don't need to be reminded that I will be sat at exactly at 6pm and not a minute earlier.. Everyone in my part noticed the attitude but didn't let it ruin our meal. The food was amazing as always we all ordered a steak which was half price due to the fantastic Happy Hour and sides to share. The donuts that were sent out for my birthday were so delicious I think we devoured them in seconds! We were in and out in such a timely manner!! I hope to continue to go back to Herbs & Rye and feel the same way as I did this time!!",

We were here for dinner with friends, but got here early for a drink. We were greeted at the bar by Emily who might be the friendliest bartender I've met yet. She was super knowledgeable and offered us drink ideas based upon our favorite selections.  The menu has an incredible selection of drinks. It's very speak-easy style. So many great choices!  After the bar we moved to the restaurant. After about 20 minutes, the hostess finally came over and asked if we needed anything and said they would find us a waiter. About 10 minutes after that, we finally had a waiter. He was welcoming and pretty knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our order and the food took over an hour to prepare.  The food was really good. I had a filet minion with the herbs & rye house rub. I also had the Mac n cheese along with the jallepeno corn. My steak temp was not as warm as I'd like it to be.   We ended up not ordering dessert. I would've considered, but was afraid I'd have to wait a long time for it. If they improved their food service, I'd give this place 5 stars.",

A work assignment brought me back here and I'm glad it did because now I see why people love it.  I've decided that the only place to sit is the bar. That's where are the excitement is and the bartenders are amazing. Not just at what they do with the libations, but because they know what customer service means. They're knocking it out of the park. During my time there, they passed out shots a couple times to all the patrons just because it was Friday. It was an amazing energy.  Spicy Mussels ($26; H/H $13): This was recommended by our bartender and I was actually hesitant! You know what happened next - I am so incredibly glad we ordered it because it is truly fantastic! Seriously, WOW. The mussels are served in a tomato stew made with white wine and it is absolutely perfect. We literally wiped the bowl clean with bread. There was no way we were leaving a drop because it's that good. And that happy hour price is KILLER!  Mediterranean Flatbread ($16): Pesto, goat cheese, artichoke, roasted tomato, and olives. Whoa. This is another home run. I remembered enjoying the flatbreads in the past, but not as much as now. The crust was so, so good - crusty perfection and ridiculous flavor. The toppings definitely sealed the deal.  USDA Certified Angus Ribeye, 18 oz ($59; H/H $29.50): I'm certain this is a big part of their popularity - 50% off steaks during happy hour. Yeah, it's a great deal. This is my third time with their steaks and I don't know what's up, but I don't enjoy them. This time, the temperature was perfect (I ordered rare plus), but there was a thick charcoal crust on the steak. We wrote it off as the way their steaks are prepared, so we took off what we could and enjoyed it as much as possible. Then, I saw photos of their steaks and realized that there is usually no crust. I should've said something, but I also wonder why they would serve it like that? Either way, I'm avoiding their steaks or I'm going to figure out a way to get that perfectly-cooked steak from them!  I love their choice of sides! They're all delicious. Brussels Sprouts and Honey Swine ($8.50) Truffle Crispy Fries ($8.50) Sweet Potato Tots ($8.50)  Doughnuts with Caramel and White Chocolate ($8.50): Fresh delicious, fluffy doughnuts. Really great. The white chocolate sauce is amazing. I could eat like 50 more.  Their cocktails are insane. I got Blood and Sand (Scotch, Cherry Herring, Sweet Vermouth, and orange juice) because that's my jam. I'm not a straight up scotch drinker, but I love a good scotch cocktail. Their interpretation of Blood and Sand is AMAZING and obviously, you get a show with it.",

    "text": "This was our favorite steakhouse in town until our last experience. We went to celebrate my birthday this week and unlike our previous visits, this one was sub-par.   My husband and I both ordered steaks. I had ordered my steak with the Herbs & Rye rub. Our steaks came out lukewarm. They burned my steak and then piled a thick pasty layer of their herb rub onto my steak to cover it up. I had to scrape it off because I was piled on thick. I didn't want to send it back because I didn't want anybody to mess with my food. Our Brussels sprouts were lukewarm as well; the only item that was hot was the potatoes.   Service was a little slower than usual. We were placed in a booth, alongside one of the walls, in the room separate from the bar. The tables were so close to each other that it was practically as if we were sitting at our neighbors' table. I was looking forward to a relaxing, nice dinner with my husband but it was difficult to create that ambiance when when you're 2 feet away from a politically charged group that's very passionate about their views.   I was ranting and raving about this place for months to my co-workers. I've been recommending it left and right. I'm not ready to write off this place since this is the 1st by experience we've had. I hope our next visit is a better one.",

From the outside the place looked a little sketch, but once we walked in the atmosphere and ambiance was great. Dim lit speeak easy style.   We had a reservation but grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. The bartenders were friendly and engaging and made a really good Old Fashioned.   Once we were seated we were surprised to hear that Happy Hour was offered at the table as well and Happy Hour prices included entrees!   We ordered the Pork Chop with sides of Asparagus, Mac & Cheese and Brussel Sprouts. If you look at all my other reviews I pretty much order the same sides everywhere. The Pork Chop was really good. I don't order Pork Chops often because not everyone can prepare them right, but they did such a good job I would definitely order again. The sides were delicious and as usual I particularly enjoyed the Truffle Mac N Cheese.   We were celebrating a birthday and at the end of the meal our server brought out dessert with a candle, which was super sweet!  On top of the food and atmosphere being great, our server was AMAZING. He was funny and chatty and made the experience. Shout out to M. Vega for the great dining experience.   We will be back and definitely for their Happy Hour, the best one in town!",

I went in last night with my Dad who is in town from New York and we received excellent service from our server Mike.   Mike took time to explain the happy hour specials and give us his recommendations off the menu. He was one of the best servers i've had in Las Vegas and as someone in the service industry that is a huge compliment from me.   We ordered the beef carpaccio & the steamed clams to start and they were both delicious! Normally when you order clams you get a little bit of grit somewhere in the dish, but there wasn't any at all in this. It is served with a big chunk of bread to dip in the delicious white wine sauce that the clams come in.   We both ordered a steak (which are half off during happy hour and come with one free side), asparagus & truffled mac n cheese. It was all excellent.   We weren't sure if we wanted dessert but Mike said the Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet was his favorite and really good so we went for it and let's just say we found room quickly to finish it!   I will definitely be coming back more frequently and sitting in Mike's section.   10 out of 10 recommend!",

It is broken down by the history of alcohol and spirits, from prohibition and beyond.  I'm obsessed with Brandy Crustas and Clover club. The mixologists are great!   Happy hour is a great deal on food as well. I think its 11 or midnight until closing 2-3am. The gnocchi with the chianti meat sauce and the alsatian flat bread are my two staples. Those are addicting! Steaks are great too and the sweet potato tots and macaroni are good.  Great bar to hang and talk and catch up. But don't expect that on a Friday/Saturday night, club crowd and dj is in the house so it gets very loud. If you're in the mood for that, go on those nights. If you want a chill evening go on the other nights. They are, however closed on Sundays.   Great hangout for groups too.",

WHEN: The first time I hit this restaurant up, I missed Happy Hour by a minute! Literally! So, from my experience, you definitely need to check it out from 5-8pm, and 12-3am! Happy Hour consists of half off the entire menu! =D Also, if you are a yelper and you let them know, you are rewarded with a free cocktail with the order of an entree. Yayy for yelpp!!  (I went there recently and there are cones directly in front of the restaurant due to construction! I automatically thought it was closed because there were no cars in the parking lot, but my friend and I took a chance. MISSION COMPLETE!)  WHERE: Located on the corner of Sahara & Arville, look out for the red sign!  WHAT: There were no cocktails for me this time, but I will look into it on my next visit! After a couple of hours of shopping, my friend and I decided we wanted to try this place out. (I really just wanted to see what the Truffle Mac&Cheese was all about, haha).   My friend and I tried:  -Italian Sausage Flatbread: I was seriously expecting something small, but the server came out with an 8-piece flatbread pizza! It was marvelous! The sausage gave it the taste it needed, and I LOVE FLATBREAD!  -Truffle Mac&Cheese: Ahhh!! Thank heaven for mac&cheese!! I am a lover of macaroni & cheese and this has got to be one of the best I've ever had!! I am craving for some more just thinking about it! There is such a perfect amount of truffle in every single bite, and the perfect amount of cheese. It is just pure perfection!  -Pork & Figs: One word that describes this dish... BOMB!! I've never tried figs (besides fig newtons, haha) but they were just dandy! I wish I would have taken a picture of the dish (as I usually do!) It was perfectly created, the pork on top of the gravy'd mashed potatoes, and the flavorful figs all around it. I highly recommend!! =D  WHY: The food is a must & an A-plusplusplus, the service was incredible (newfound friends), and the atmosphere was just CHILL!  *NOTE: REMEMBER TO GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!",

Here's the Low Down...  Decor: Swanky, chic and old school.  One of my favorite \"date places\" or just a cool place to hang.   The Booze: BTG wine list is solid.  The cocktails are amazing.  These guys know their stuff and have really mastered the art of Mixology with their craft cocktails.    Extensive list of all liquors, specifically their Gins and Whiskeys.  Solid beer list  The food:  The food as awesome.  Especially for the reverse happy hour!  My personal favorites are the Jalapeno Cream Corn, Kansas City Strip with peppercorn sauce and Prosciutto Asparagus Flatbread.     If you haven't been yet, YOU NEED TO GO!",

The cocktails are fun to explore and I enjoyed the Mediterranean flatbread but I just wish their happy hour was a little better.  There isn't a discount on any cocktails or on the majority of food.  You can get 50% off a few wines, one beer, steaks and that is all.",

The New York strip was also excellent. Truffle Mac was very truffly. Broccoli and cheese was amazing. My Pimms Cup was also one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I'll have to think hard to figure out what was better.  I wish I wasn't on such a short trip and an I frequent visitor, but it beats the Strip restaurants hands down in my book.",

In spite of the bad drink, I plan to return as the cow was wonderful.....and after all , that's why we went there in the first place.  Be sure to check out their Happy Hour pricing.  It's not just bar snacks...it's 1/2 price on many....if not most....of their menu items.  They have HH something like 4-8 PM and again after midnight.  I know the details are on their site, so check it out....and enjoy your meal.  It'll be a taster.  The place also has a low key Vegas retro vibe about it too.  Makes it a fun atmosphere  to go along with the excellent food.",

    "text": "Yeah, okay, I know there are a bunch of 5 star ratings on here and very easily they could be justified, maybe we hit the place on the wrong night.  The food with the exception of one thing was excellent, far far better than I was expecting.  For me, the Kansas city cut steak with truffle and parm fries. For the wife, a Caesars salad and the sliders.  The salad was excellent, a good bite to the dressing, the sliders were also very good, though a little over cooked IMHO.  The steak, while listed as choice, I would not have argued if I had been told it was prime, it was a darn good steak, perfectly cooked.  The fries...Yeah, here we go again..... Okay, the rest of the food shows that the chef knows how to cook and present good food, damn good food in fact, so why does he think that buy in bulk US food fries should in any way, shape or form be found in this restaurant ?????  Seriously, this place could easily hit it out of the park, but when you are charging $7.50 for fires, hand cut them, they taste better, they look better and they are cheaper in the long run.  So now you are probably wondering why I only gave 3 stars, sure if you know the way I rate places you would be thinking a 4 star review, well yep, minus 1 star for the BS fries.  But the service, wow, yeah, this was the let down for me in a big way, the place isn't that big, there were 3 waitresses working and yet they all seemed to be running around doing nothing, as I said, maybe a bad night, those do happen, but it really could have been so much better. Slow to take the order, slow to get drinks, slow to refill drinks, slow to clear plates, slow to give the check.  The place certainly has a great ambiance,  this is a place I would bring friends, one small issue, the music could do with being a touch lower, on a couple of the jazz numbers the trumpet note just went right through me, I could see the same reaction from a few others, so I am guessing it's not me just being an old fart...Though I will say, it's nowhere near the level of say Fire Fly which can be stupidly loud at times.  Last little thing..The happy hour...If your going to offer a happy hour on food and drinks, maybe something other than the steaks and a couple of clam dishes, which btw, made them prices I would happily pay, the regular price for say clams and linguine is $28...Yeah sure.  Drink prices as well, great to offer half price drinks, but when the regular price for a Pimm's cup is $22, your not really offering much, btw, the cost is just under a dollar to make that drink and while I will say, the bartender we were watching is maybe one of the best in Vegas, it's still a stupid mark up.  Yes I know, a lot of negative, easy fixes for the most part and yes, we will be going back, fingers crossed the service issues were just a bad night.",

    "text": "I popped in late Friday night for food and drinks with friends and had an absolute blast. I have been here before and have always had a great experience. This was no exception.  Friday night we shared a carpaccio (a fave of mine, as some of you know, and so I am ultra persnickety about this dish), a pork loin dish, salads, and... I feel like we had half the menu between us... and there were only 5 of us! The food was perfectly cooked (or not, as appropriate), seasoned, and, truly, wasn't on the plate long at all. A lot of \"you *have* to taste this!\" and \"I'll fight you for the last bite of that...\" was heard amongst our little group. (To be fair, I think I may have stabbed someone with a fork while uttering that last bit...)  Not to be outdone by the food, the bartenders were on their game. We all went for the \"Herbs & Rye\"... a drink that is decided upon by whosoever is keeping the bar. We were treated to their famous classic cocktails (one of the best menus in town for these oldies but goodies), never receiving the same one twice, and sometimes finding them with a twist or a dash or a splash, to make them even more creative. Much like the food, drinks were passed around and lauded and coveted. Repeatedly.  The space is small and cozy without being stifling or claustrophobic, the decor is dark and enveloping, lit perfectly, and seems to transport you out of Vegas - or maybe just to a Vegas long gone (in other words, no seizure-inducing, flashing-light video game machines or clang of slots machines).   Intimate and social all at once, there are romantic booths, classic table seating, or, do what we did... belly up to the bar and trust the people behind it. You won't be disappointed.",

When we walked in the steak house has the ambiance of a haunted house with there being almost NO LIGHTING,old antique decorations, and creepy paintings. The menu is very brief but VERY DIFFICULT to read with the lack of lights.   I did find a pasta dish on the menu and ordered that, much to my delight. Also found an alcoholic drink that was very tasty. I made the mistake of telling the waiter I needed more time while everyone else ordered their first round of drinks and I didn't get another chance to order for about 20 minutes, also takes a solid 15 minutes for the bartender to make it.   Over all great food and drinks how ever the ambiance and service time suffer badly, also pretty pricey it was $450 for 5 people. A great place to go for a special occasion, but wouldn't go for a random dinner.",

I would much rather spend the money at someplace that cared that I was there and made me feel welcome and invited either way you're going to spend the same amount of money you might as well get something that's worth it.

    "text": "The Lion's Tail and the clams in garlic are all I needed to make me a fan. Add to that it was Reverse Happy Hour = bigger fan. Went with bros Tien & Anthony for part 2 of the Potluck 3 part after party.   It retains the clubby darkness of the Venetian Restaurant which used to be here for years. It should be noted that wells ($3?) & some beers are on Happy Hour prices, but the Specialty Cocktails they are so well known for are not. Still: the Lion's Tail is epic, spicy, and deep with many right notes hit. (10$)  Speaking of high notes: those garlic clams were delicious. A generous serving Tien was glad to share as he devoured the famous Happy Hour steak Special. It was great to have Amanda pop in and hang out, gift me a picture of beautiful Petra and enjoy (?!?!) the old skool Hip Hop videos and mating rituals as the bar. The wee hours bring out interesting people, for sure.   Our waitress was adorable but not quite familiar with the menu (or maybe didn't know a LT is spicy) Suffice it to say the Eye Candy is there; MENSA members? Not so much. Location is last place you'd expect a Hipster bar, and that is good. Wasn't overly Hipster for me = no hives ;))  Think it would make a sexy date night spot and will try either of the HH again. It can get pricy: but pricy + quality is just fine with me. Much rather pay more for real food & drink by mixology masters than cheap processed food/greasy HH specials/cheap booze.   This again is a highly rated Yelp place which lived up to the hype for me. Always a good thing.   Yelp 100 Challenge",

    "text": "I'm a really big fan of Herbs & Rye. I've only gone a couple times so far, but the perfect storm of quality food, excellent customer service and happy hour half priced steaks has won me over immensely.   Each time I have come here I have been treated awesomely right from stepping in the door and being greeted by the friendly hostess. And the waitresses Donna and Debbie are fantastic as well. They are friendly and they go above and beyond to take care of you.   I have opted for the 18 oz. Rib-Eye both times and have been very pleased with it. Rib-Eye is my go to steak in most any circumstance. I did try a bite of the New York Strip and that was pretty fantastic too. The sides are incredible. My favorite is the truffle mac and cheese, but I have also been a fan of the garlic mashed potatoes and the truffle parmesan french fries. The steaks come with one side order and during happy hour, they are an absolute deal. They also have $5 well drinks and I think a $3 amber ale, if I remember correct. If you want Jack, they charge you $8. That's my one knock against this place, but I'll live. The bread also isn't bad and definitely hits the spot while you wait. Nothing really to write home about, but better than nothing while you wait.   The ambiance of the place is pretty classy. It's dim and the walls are lined with a nice velvet looking wall paper that looks pretty elegant. It's the kind of place you would probably want to dress up a little for.   Overall, Herbs is most likely going to be a regular spot of mine when I need my steak fix. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor and head over there. Best time would be during one of their happy hours. The first one is from 5 to 8 and I think the second one starts at 11. Oh and they're currently in the process of changing out their beer and wine menu along with adding a few food items including a Porterhouse. More reasons to check back.",

    "text": "The food here was absolutely incredible. We attempted to split the 120 oz steak between three people, but we could not eat the whole thing. But, hands down one of the most perfectly cooked steaks I've ever had. It comes with two larger sizes that are perhaps TOO large but we chose the truffle mac and cheese and garlic mash which did not disappoint. We also had the happy hour mussels with a spicy marinara that was so good we were drinking the leftovers like soup afterwards. The cocktail menu is expansive and creative with many variations of drinks that I had never heard of before. All of our food was purchased on Happy Hour pricing, which was quite the value for such great food and at a place in such high demand.   Here's one of the instances where I wish you could give a half star because I would go with a 4.5 out of 5 with the only dings being credited toward customer service. About two hours prior to our reservation, I received a phone call to confirm that our plans were still on. They asked if we were celebrating anything, and I let them know there was a birthday at the table. This led me to think that they would do something in honor of the celebration. Our meal ended without dessert ever being offered so it felt like there was no point in even letting them know we were there celebrating. I told the waiter who the birthday boy was before he arrived, and he didn't even wish him a happy birthday. Additionally, at the beginning of our meal, we asked for separate checks. The waiter said they didn't do that. When we got our check, we spent 45 minutes figuring out who needed to pay what (because the happy hour prices aren't reflected on the receipt; one large discount was taken off at the end). As we were getting close to having it figured out, the waiter finally came in and offered to do split checks, saying it would just take him a long time (as if the 45 minutes we had spent figuring it out wasn't enough). It was very frustrating to be told he couldn't do it in the beginning, spend the time figuring it out, then get offered to have it done anyway.",

They open at 5 pm, we arrived at 5:08 pm and already there was a line out the door. We placed our name on the waiting list with the hostess, who quoted us 15 minute wait. The host texts you when the table is ready so you don't have to keep checking back in, which is nice. Our wait time was a perfect amount of time to grab a drink at the bar. The bartender was nice. I didn't know what specifically to order but told him I don't like dry drinks but a little light and fruity. He said he knew exactly what to make and it was delicious.   The drink menu here is extensive and the cocktails are separated by each era, which i found to be very unique and cool. The prohibition era and etc.   Our server was great and took the time to thoroughly explain options on the menu we had questions about.     Pros: Great first date spot to leave a great impression, Classy restaurant with great service, Great happy hour specials with late night happy hour options as well. Dimly lit cool brick building with an old vegas style vibe with great cocktails. I would recommendation trying the sweet potato tater tots or the garlic mash potatoes   Cons: Small space so wait times if you don't have a reservation   Tips: I would highly recommend making a reservation. This place fills up!  On Happy hour, anything on the menu with double red stars is half off!",

This dark and vibey little cocktail bar has a \"locals only\" feel with nods to the prohibition era. Think penny tin, chandeliers, and a big, beautiful (and well stocked, might I add) bar. The gentleman tending bar the evening we were there remembered Ms Taylor from a few months prior--if that's not amazing customer service, I'm not sure what is.   We bellied up to the bar and took at look at their awesome cocktail menu. They divide the cocktail list between different ages--the Gothic Age, Tiki Boom, Prohibition, etc. Lots of gin and whiskey on this menu if that's your thing! I was looking for something light and not too boozy for the end of the night, so the bartender whipped me up a very refreshing Pimm's Cup. It was the perfect night cap!   Didn't try the food this time around, but I've heard great things. I'd be here ALL the time if I were livin' it up in Vegas and will definitely be back next time I'm in Sin City.",

The bartenders were amazing beyond belief, what skill and expertise! A big shout out to the dark haired girl who helped us on Thursday. I would recommend eating in the bar area over the dining room. We proceeded to the dining room for our 6:30 reservation, we here seated 20 minutes later. Ugh. The hostess could have cared less about he delay and could have showed a bit more hospitality on her part That would have added to a better experience.  The dining room was dark and very fun, the tables that you sit at are a bit declasse. meaning not really up to par. Plus, the booth we sat in sank, it needs padding. LOL  The steaks and lobster tail where large and fabulous! The side dishes we had of asparagus were cold and the whiskey potatoes lacked flavor. The support staff busboys where excellent. The waitress was very slow and we rarely saw her. She also had a non caring attitude when we told her about our cold side dishes.  I so look forward to going back, but in the bar area.",

We had the littleneck clams and a flat bread called the Farmer. The sauce for the clams was phenomenal and clams cooked to perfection. Suggest using the bread they serve to sop up the sauce!! The flat bread had large chunks of delicious bacon, spinach, cheese and topped with 2 eggs. Drinks were delicious and well made. Service was excellent and friendly.

    "text": "Off the bat, I want to say that if I could give the service and ambiance 10 stars I would, it was that good; I'll go into why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 in a bit, but this is a fantastic place for an evening out with your SO or friends, if you can afford it.   Located off Valley View on Sahara, the place opens at 5PM and has a 3 hour happy hour, but even at half off, dinner and cocktails for 2 will run you around $150, which you really don't think about while you're there.   The room is dark (you need your flashlight to read the menu), with rich deep booths that are really comfortable. There is a feeling of casual luxury that made for a really enjoyable meal.   The service was simply put, flawless; our waiter and his assistant were incredibly attentive and helpful, we waited for nothing and were treated like royalty.   The food was good, but for the price there were some things that were below 5 star; I ordered a NY strip, my wife the filet mignon. Hers was delicious, mine less so, but not awful. I chose the house rub which, while flavorful, was too spicy and overshadowed the taste of the steak; I'll choose the filet next time. The sides disappointed me; my wife chose sweet potato tots which were somewhat bland to me (she loved them), I ordered the truffle parmesan steak fries which just seemed less flavorful than I'd expected. We both loved the caprese salad; fresh mozzarella and arguably the best balsamic vinaigrette I've ever had. Dessert was fresh cooked doughnuts with white chocolate or caramel sauce; hot and delicious, they even came with the holes!  Overall just a great evening out and a place I'll definitely want to try again, but at the cost it is definitely a special occasion type of place, and totally justifies going there. I'd suggest reservations unless you want to sit at a table, or, you can just sit at the bar, which is deep and easy to eat your meal on. Enjoy!",

My friends and I have done our share of the strip in Vegas, so we stayed at a suite in the Golden Nugget. Looking for something out of the ordinary, we came across this steak place. Oddly enough, we found out that it had a late-night happy hour from midnight-3am and steaks were half off. The prices are reasonable as is, but even better then! I knew it was a legitimate spot when the menu had two other options before \"rare\" for those with a bloodthirsty appetite.   I chose a New York Strip, medium rare, with a side of truffle macaroni & cheese. The steak was cooked perfectly, lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, and the macaroni & cheese was delectable. One friend ordered the bourbon potatoes  - wow, what flavor!  Thank you for a wonderful experience. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll have to drop in again.",

They have happy hour twice a night & it is the best deal you will get. Half off steaks!! I mean the drinks are still very expensive & that's where they'll get you but I'm more of a foodie so I could take or leave the drinks (there are some really good ones though).   5-8 happy hour is always super crowded but they let you make reservations during that time. I was shocked! So we took my dad there for his birthday this year, made a reservation, got right in & had a reasonably priced steak dinner. The late happy hour at 12 am is usually never packed except maybe weekends so we can just walk right in & get seated.   The sides are delicious & the drink menu takes you back in time. The atmosphere is very speak-easy like and I have yet to have a bad meal there. I've only gone during happy hour though since you can't beat the deal",

(Yes ppl sometimes kids need to eat too and not everyone likes to take their kids to shit restaurants)  The hostess was rude and miserable not sure why. Luckily our waiter was super nice and did everything he could to make it a decent experience. The place is dark and loud but overall I think it was the hostess attitude that annoyed me the most. Also the food was mediocre and for all those reasons I just don't care about this place and wouldn't recommend it.  Disclaimer- since I cannot update my review I'm going to edit. I may or may not have been there on a Sunday. I don't have the exact night on my calendar and I'm not sure why that's relevant  So just to recap: food was ok, waiter was awesome, hostess needs a new attitude. Hope that helps",

Yes its that old, but the history behind the place and the aura it projects is a must tell and classic.   Unfortunately I only visited to enjoy and check out the raved about cocktails.  We enjoyed a few different cocktails and all were unique in its own way. I was a little skeptical because I am a vodka drinker and only 2 or 3 of the cocktails had vodka. The majority of the drinks contain gin. So I asked what they recommend and went for it.  Cocktails: Ramos Gin Fizz- Now this is a creamy creation. They warn you it will take awhile because there are 3 steps to making this drink all which require patience and time. I was really interested because one of the ingredients is egg white. Never seen or heard that being used. The drink was delicious, creamy, not too sweet and you couldn't even taste the alcohol. Definitely recommend this one!  Blood & Sand- honestly I only ordered it to see the presentation. They spark a mini fire blaze with the orane peel at the end. Get your video out! The drink was a bit strong and the scotch is pretty prominent, served like a martini.   Corpse Reviver No.2 - only thing I can remember is how much you could taste the absinthe  Vesper - it was one of the only ones with vodka. Served like a martini and definitely has that strong taste of alcohol.I guess with Gin & Vodka how could it not.   We sat at the bar and it was pretty busy so as far as service it was above average. The bartender was super busy the entire time, I wouldn't say he was the nicest guy but he made amazing cocktails.   I definitely want to go back and try the food. Half off all steaks for happy hour...FYI!",

A good friend of mine had originally recommended the establishment, and it didn't disappoint.  I can't really speak for the alcohol as I don't drink, but the steak and the sides I ordered were delicious! We also shared the clam appetizer. That's was one of our favorites. Delicious!  Definitely would recommend this establishment! As this is a nicer establishment and higher quality meals, definitely expect to pay in that price point. Definitely coming back again!",

They have a happy hour from 5-8 where you get 1/2 off steaks and certain drinks so our group of 6 was open to trying.   When you walk in, you can't see 2 inches in front of your face. It is dark and hard to see. The waitress greeted us and we were seated in the bar area, where the bar was packed. We order some drinks, got our bread (amazing) and our server went over the steaks.   I ordered an 18oz Ribeye Med Rare and it was cooked perfect! By this time we had a few drinks, began to relax, and were having fun in the bar, which was hopping at this point. The food was great and the truffle steak fries and truffle Mac n cheese was amazing!   I am very critical of my food and places I eat but please don't judge a book by its cover and come eat here!!!",

    "text": "This place has been on our radar for a while now but we finally got around to checking it out when some friends suggested it for dinner.  We arrived a little early so we made our way to the end of the bar where we were lucky enough to grab two seats.  I started to run through their extensive list of cocktails and it took me a few seconds to realize how neato their menu was, broken down by eras.  It was sort of educational but fun, cuz it was booze.   Because I'm a fan of egg white drinks, I went with the Pisco Sour (also a fan of this drink anyway). And this was a doozy.  It was the fluffiest drink ever and the best Pisco Sour I've ever had the pleasure of throwing back.  I think the bartender's name was Joe.  He employed a multi-step shaking process and definitely got the volume other bartenders covet.  Our friends showed up and we made our way to the entry area to greet them.  Unfortunately, the only damper on the evening was how long it took them to seat us since we had reservations and the table (as well as other tables) had vacant and ready to go since we started waiting.  Maybe they were trying to scrounge up a server?  I dunno.  Food was impressive on the whole.  To start, we the calamari which was deep fried but then tossed with some sweet and hot peppers.  Yum!  For the main event, I ordered the filet mignon while hubby got the double cut pork chop.  Hubby thought the pork chop was decent, though a little overcooked.  My filet mignon was a perfect \"rare\" as requested.  Yum!  We shared a few sides including the jalapeno cream corn (delicious), garlicky spinach (really garlicky but not my cup o'tea due to a sweetness you don't usually get in this dish), and truffle mac & cheese (must order).  During dinner, I had a couple more drinks - the Hemingway Daiquiri (good and not at all like the pink slushy stuff you think of when you hear \"daiquiri\") then went back to the Pisco Sour.  Unfortunately, this next Pisco Sour wasn't as fantastic as the first one.  Oh well!  Service was pretty attentive.  Our friends happened to be familiar with our guy (though I don't fault him for pretending to remember them) because he used to be the bartender.  He was very friendly, helpful and attentive.  Definitely going to be a place for us to come back to, especially for the drinks!",

    "text": "OMG I am in love. I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I finally got to go on Friday. We went for their first happy hour of the night from 5-8pm to take advantage of the half off steak special. They also have a second happy hour from 12-3am for those who like a late night snack after drinks at the bar. We decided to split the King Kong Ribeye between four people.  Before we sat down for dinner we went to the bar. There I discovered the massive drink menu and had the hardest time deciding on a drink. I need to go back multiple times because there are so many I want to try! What is so cool is that they have drinks by time periods. You can order a drink from originated from the 1800s or 1900s. Under each drink they have a mini description of how this drink came about. I thought that was so interesting and neat. The drink I got at the bar was the French 75. It intrigued me that it had champagne. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it. We also ordered the calamari at the bar which also did not disappoint. I loved all the banana hot peppers they had in it.  When we were seated I then ordered the Bee Knees. Best decision of the night. It was gin, lemon and honey. So delicious and not too sweet. I need to learn how to make this at home. As I said before we decided to get the King Kong Ribeye cooked medium. It also comes with a complimentary side which I thought was awesome. We decided on the mac and cheese. We then ordered the Brussel sprouts and asparagus. The meal was great. The steak was good just the right amount and was very tender. We had more than enough and was able to to take it home and eat it for lunch the following day. All of the sides were a perfect size and they were all eaten by the end of the meal.  We were too full for dessert but those doughnuts sounded awesome!   If you are looking for a steak house in Vegas you must try Herbs and Rye.",

We got away with an 18oz Ribeye, Truffle Mac & Cheese, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, a fancy drink AND a nice tip for less than $80. It felt like highway robbery.  They wrote on the menu descriptions of types of meat cooks, and enlisted the following, \"Well done - Burnt and pointless\" they won my heart with this. The medium rare we got was 'Slap My Mother Good!' Seriously.   Our server kind of gave me this elitist response when asking for steak sauce as if it's blasphemy to ask for it on the side for the option. I understand the people under the mentality that \"the steak is so good you don't need sauce\" because I've heard that a thousand times. But if you are a baker that bakes the best cupcakes in the world, who are you to scoff at me for asking for frosting and a couple sprinkles, you know? It's a preference and you didn't cook the steak yourself, chief... take a breath.  His food runner on the other hand: awesome. He delivered the sauce and even playfully joked about it having cravings himself. He was very pleasant to both of us.   ** There is a $7 surcharge if you decide to share a steak with another person (which I recommend anyway if you'd like to prevent premature prostate problems). Just be advised.",

    "text": "May I preface by saying I ended up here by default. We had initially decided for a traditional steak dinner at the Golden Steer, but they were closing, and suggested we try Herbs & Rye because they were open late. I immediately called and made a reservation for 11.   We arrived a little early, and they were able to seat us. They didn't appear to be busy at all. We assumed we had just missed the dinner rush. The atmosphere was loud and dark, but gave you that feel that you were in an old speakeasy from the mob heydays.   I ordered the surf & turf, filet and lobster tail, and my husband ordered the NY steak with truffle mac n cheese. I also ordered a dirty martini while I waited, which was served with blue cheese olives, which were amazing. When it was delivered to our table everything looked great. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. My lobster tail, on the other hand, was way over cooked, and judging by the burnt shell, I should have known. The truffle mac n cheese was okay. It could have used some seasoning, but there wasn't any on the table. My husband seemed to enjoy it though.   We finished our meal with a few more from their vast and interesting cocktails menu. We are still dreaming about one of them we had that night. It was about that time, sometime after midnight, that we were informed that if we had come an hour later our meal could have nearly been half off for their happy hour. It seemed as though the air had been let out of the room. It would have been nice to know before we had ordered that if we waited we could have had our steaks half off. It wasn't a cheap meal, and after this was mentioned, it kind of seemed like a let down. That completely explained why people started filling up the place at midnight.   In the end, would I come back here? Perhaps only  for happy hour, and only for the amazing cocktails.",

Excellent customer service, well executed food and superior craft cocktails are a few things you have in store when you dine here. Do not judge this place by the outside appearance, cause as soon as you step into the restaurant you feel as if you walked onto the set of a beautifully executed speakeasy scene in a movie. The dim lighting perfectly complements the atmosphere they are going for.   They have happy hour Monday-Friday from 5-8 (a late night happy hour too) where you can get a juicy, savory, perfectly prepared 18oz ribeye for a little more than $30. That's hard to beat for a premium steakhouse. Everything, and I mean everything, I've tried was extremely tasty. I'm not embellishing at all. Their calamari appetizer was one of the best I've ever had (it's a big portion, perfect size for a group of four) and it comes with strips of prosciutto and banana peppers. The Yardbird and risotto is one of my favorite non-steak dishes at this place. The linguini and clams are some of the best I've ever tasted. There are no wrong choices at this place. The only problem I have is getting too full before my entree arrives.    This place is great for celebrating birthdays, which was why we came...The server, Mr. Logan (I can't recall his first name) took excellent care of our party, so I wanted to give him a special shout out. Again, this is easily one of the best restaurants off the strip in Las Vegas. Do yourself a favor and dine at Herbs & Rye",

I'd heard friends mumble the words \"Herbs & Rye\" after visiting Sin City, and with less than 24 hours there, I had to find out what all the hub bub was all about.  Pulling up, the building is totally unassuming. Free standing, dark, with a big sign in black and red, \"Herbs & Rye\". It didn't feel old or new, but it was comfortable, and somehow felt like home instantly.   The music was thumpin, and the sounds of electro swing filled the room. The bar was loud, but not overwhelming, only loud enough to make you want to speak louder to be heard. The vibe was incredibly friendly, regular, but super vibrant and boisterous at the same time.   Cocktails were totally classic, and the bartenders were fast, efficient, and damn good at their jobs. A \"Blood and Sand\" for me, \"Last Word\" for pops, and a scotch on a mighty big rock for our friend. Everything was great and I even showed my dad, a fervent neat spirits drinker, that cocktails can honor the spirits inside.   The vibe alone would be reason to come back for dinner, but this is the kind of place I'd like to drink in every night!",

The rib eye was great but the best part of it is this place has a happy hour from 5 - 8 and most everything on the menu is 1/2 price including all of their steaks! The parking lot was packed with a bunch of local license plates. A good thing. Mine was one of only two cars in the entire parking lot from California. The entire wait staff and especially Christian were very attentive. I highly recommend the spot especially during happy hour.",

I've come for cocktails and appetizers and then other times full dinners.  Portions are big (it's a man-friendly place), so you can share, but honestly, the food is so good, you'll devour your meal.  There are two seating sections, one in a room and the other near the bar area, but with cozy booths.  If you are there with a date or some friends you really want to get to know, I'd suggest the room, rather than the bar area, which can be a bit loud.  But, maybe I'm just getting too old.",

    "text": "Prior to heading out for New Years Eve a group of us booked a table at Herbs and Rye for pre-celebration food and drinks.  Sadly we had a very poor experience which seems at odds with the general high standards of review for this establishment.  Initially thinks seemed ok, the server took our drinks order and placed the bread plates...then things began to go downhill.   Firstly the drinks took an age to arrive. When they did the two Pilsners (Firestone) had a strange soapy taste to them. Eventually we managed to grab the waitress who after initially seating was very disinterested with our table. She took the drinks and came back with fresh ones, however, again the same soapy taste. I asked if the pipes had been cleaned recently at which point out of the shadows jumped the manager. He quickly said the pipes had been cleaned to their usual standards and maybe we weren't used to the taste of Pilsner...well I and my buddy are very used to the taste and I can tell you this wasn't right! I asked the manager if he himself had tasted it and he sheepishly replied that he had not and that he would go and taste it...he never came back to the table.    It took about an hour for the food to finally arrive. The bread course never arrived.  A table next to us that arrived after us was also served dinner before us and got their bread. We would have loved to have had the opportunity to point the problem out but the waitress was nowhere to be seen.   When the food arrived the steaks were tepid and the truffle fries cold. The entire meal had obviously been sat waiting to be served for some time. Again it took an age to be checked on and in the end we grabbed a porter and told him about the fries. He apologised and returned in about 5-10min with fresh hot fries. Once he had taken the fries back to the kitchen the waitress appeared and asked how the meal was, as we began to tell her the issues she completely ignored what we were saying and said she was glad everything was ok and she walked away. We were astounded!    At the end of the meal the manager came round and asked if everything had been ok. We gave him a precis akin to this review. He didn't understand the term 'tepid' which for a restaurant manager was pretty epic, and his solution to the problem was he would love to have us back and gave one member of the party his card.  He did offer a round of champagne or desserts if we so wished but as we had earlier explained we really needed to get going to Fremont.   The meal took 2 hours in the end and we only had an entree. When the check came the soapy beers had been removed and that was it. We asked for the fries to be comped also and the waitress disappeared for another 10mins. By this time we were exasperated and could not believe the poor service. We understand that NYE is a tricky time but the restaurant was far from being overly busy and looked to be on a standard service footing in terms of numbers in there.  The food we had was tasty, just not hot enough and let down with the addition of poor service. Disappointing Herbs and Rye, disappointing...treat your locals well if you want return custom and good word of mouth reviews.",

We came here after the Vegas night clubs during the late night happy hour from 12AM-3AM, and it has one of the most amazing happy hour menu. All items listed with 2 stars are 50% off - which includes their steaks. But wait, there's more! The half off steak also includes a choice sides. We ended up spending about ~$50 for a 16oz Ribeye, and a 14oz New York Strip with two sides (Mushroom and Creamed Corn). I was speechless! The steaks were delicious! I would say they were on par with Flemings steakhouse, and for the price that can't be beat.  I'm savoring about the steaks as i'm writing this review. Looking forward to my next Vegas trip to come!",

Place was clean and music was awesome! They played a lot of old school jams w/videos, which I thought was pretty neat. The bartenders were quick and kept traffic moving along. However, the food-a bit too pricey. For those prices might as well go to a nice steakhouse. The waitresses spent most of their time chit chatting with the D.j. and shooting the breeze with the bartenders instead of attending to all the tables waiting to be served. Fun place for drinks, probably not the best place to go to if you're hungry. Long wait, expensive and not worth the price.",

I had a 14 ounce NY strip. $21.00, the side was a small portion of Garlic mash. I  had 2 Pepsi 's $3.50 each. no refill.  the price was reasonable but the Steak was tough and the mash cold. my son ordered the 120 Oz special which came with 2 sides. Happy hour price for this meal was $180.00   regularly  $390.00 this special was supposed to feed approx. 8 people. the meat was better but again the sides were enough to only feed approx 5 people.  Total price for 15 people came to 843.00. including mandatory tip of 187.00. This is supposed to be the happy hour price of half off. I felt the prices were inflated especially because of the quality and portions of the sides. the steaks were served without any kind of mushrooms or onions. If you wanted a sauce of any kind you had to ask for it. It was not offered. I'm not against paying a fair price for a good steak however the quality of steak was like chuck steak. Myself and 9 other of the guest felt the same way. I do not recommend anyone should go to this restaurant.",

The music wasn't too loud so it was easy to have good conversation with our whole group.  The classic cocktails were interesting, but a bit pricey for a \"locals\" bar.   The Carpaccio was good and had a decent portion size. The gnocchi was awesome, perfectly cooked with a hearty and flavorful sauce. The Flatbread was very flavorful and was a decent size. I wouldn't order the calamari again, as it was a bit too chewy and there wasn't much flavor.   Over-all, this place has a low-key vibe and is a chill place to lounge, eat, and drink. Don't expect a high energy party bar or dancing.",

All was bearable until when the check came. We were charged tax and \"automatic\" gratuity based on the full price of what we ordered! Not the happy hour price! Based on what the bill should have been, we paid 30% gratuity for crappy service! This place has figured out how to advertise one thing then charging you more then the normal price! We know we weren't the only ones noticing this. Everyone had their phones out adding up their bills. The manager went to four other tables besides our trying to explain how the happy hour price isn't a deal. This is our last time at Herbs and Rye. We will spend our hard earned money at an honest place.",

    "text": "After my first visit to Herbs & Rye, I was going to write 2 reviews just to give the place 10 stars. After my second trip, I have to give it 3 stars, and here's why.   On my first visit, my friend and I decided to indulge in the happy hour special and we ordered the flat iron steaks. He ordered his with $3.50 extra house rub, I ordered mine plain. We also paid for two alacarte sides that we decided to split. When the steaks were placed in front of us, we weren't sure which had the rub and which didn't. We later found out that neither had the rub, but those were some damn good steaks. So good that we considered ordering second steaks. The flat iron was juicy, flavorful, and tender. I wanted to slap someone they were so good. We went around bragging about how wonderful the steaks were, and they were. At the time we thought, since we were charged for it, that both of our steaks got the house rub.   Fast forward to the next trip where we brought some friends along, we decided almost recreate our first trip. We got 3 Kansas City cuts 2 with the rub and one with blue cheese. Lets just say this is when we discovered that we paid for a rub that we didn't get and we also paid for sides that should've come with the meal. I had to verify, since the first server charged us separately for the sides whether or not a side was included with a steak order. That rub that we didn't receive the first go round was definitely not the be's knees.  A couple sitting in the both next us thought the same thing. Finally, my friend who got the blue cheese topping on his steak really wanted more steak than blue cheese. Blue cheese is pungent enough that the entire 12oz piece of steak did not need to be covered in it. I took a bite of his steak and tasted no steak at all, just blue cheese.   My advice, get the flat iron with no extra anything.",

What a waist. I was very disappointed. The dinning room had way to dark \"mood\" lighting (we could barely read the menu and everyone knows dimness vails flaws), the waitress was annoyed, snarky, the crab cakes were super fishy. I had to spit them out in the bathroom to avoid food poisoning. The mashed potatoes served with the over priced surf & turf had to be instant! Although I can't be positive about the mashed potatoes, the texture and flavor definitely tasted like it. There is no outdoor smoking area, you can't take your drinks outside (laws and all). The dinning area was claustrophobic and they wouldn't split the check (understandable, but still annoying). Overall, not the best experience. My suggestion, if you're someone who prefers quality over quantity (cheap happy hour), this is not the spot for you. Save your money. Go somewhere with more integrity. Somewhere that doesn't insult the intelligence of its patrons. Really? Instant mashed potatoes with surf & turf. Tacky.",

It should get 5 stars because of the fantabulous mixology & 1/2 price wonderful steaks (during both happy hours, I usually end up after midnight,) but the service has ALWAYS been atrocious! If you sit at the bar, it's better, but I usually go with a group of people & we need a booth or table. It's always 15-30 minutes just for drinks & on top of that the waitstaff NEVER writes down orders, so something is ALWAYS wrong! Sometimes a drink is forgotten or the steaks are cooked wrong or the side item is wrong... It's always something & it's frustrating since you wait so long just to get these items, then forever again to get them corrected! They also never take anything off the bill to compensate you for all the trouble; it's just the way they do business. People just have to expect that & choose to go or not since it has such great drinks & food...",

Parking is terrible (in an alley) and despite only having to wait 20 minutes for a table, it took over an hour from the time of ordering to get our food. When it finally did come, it was wrong (added a spicy rub that wasn't asked for). I didn't send it back because I didn't want to wait another hour for my steak. When I was finally able to catch up with the waiter, he said he had put my order in correctly and I must have gotten someone else's steak. Upon getting the bill, (which also took way longer than it should have) nothing \"adjusted\" to acknowledge the mistake and poor service. Food was decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",

This place rocks - it's chill, has a great happy hour and has some pretty solid food.  The happy hour is from 5-8pm and then from midnight-3am so perfectly timed!  The location is pretty mellow but it's nice and spacious and the service is attentive.  Definitely a great spot to kick it and avoid the foolish tourists and their \"woo\"-ing!",

I have to say is the historic cocktail menu where you can get drinks from certain time periods, starting from the early 1900s.  There's not much vodka in the early years for some reason, not sure why.  I'm terrible with history.  I wish I had come during happy hour, because it can get a little pricy.  The food is great though.  They have their own take on calamari which I recommend for everyone to get.    Got the spicy mussels also, which I don't recommend as highly as the calamari, but still good.  I would def come here to hang out and have drinks, but more of a second choice for dining.",

We each ordered a classic cocktail (their well ginl is Beefeaters!!) and the drinks were delicious.   The wedge salads showed up: my gosh, they were so delicious and made right. Lots of cherry tomatoes, bleu cheese crumbles and bleu cheese dressing.   The rest of the appetizers showed up -- they were also delicious! Of particular mention are the chicken wings which were very tangy and delicious.   Of note: we ordered way too much food,, and as our hotel doesn't have a refrigerator, we had to abandon a lot of it there -- I HATE wasting delicious food!!",

    "text": "I'm not one for writing reviews on Yelp as I think the majority of yelpers aren't qualified to be writing reviews and for the most part are full of self importance. This is my first (and hopefully only) post on this terrible app. Only doing it as I've read too many reviews from people with sh#t for brains.  1) Don't take stars off venues because they only have a small parking lot. Parking is a privilege not a right. Bars/restaurants/lounges pay rent on the entirety of the land the venue occupies, including the parking lot. They are not generating revenue from parking, so just be happy that any parking is provided. Walking 10 minutes isn't going to hurt you, tubby.  2) Don't take stars off a steak house/cocktail lounge for having no beers on tap. If you want tap beer perhaps you should be at a pub. If you feel the need to drink beer at a cocktail lounge drink bottled beer; if you can't afford bottled beer what the hell are you doing at a cocktail lounge?  3) Don't take stars off a restaurant because there's nothing you really felt like eating on the menu. Seriously...you went there Einstein. If I was craving sushi, I wouldn't go to an Italian restaurant, then complain about the lack of sushi.  4) Don't complain about waiting 10 mins to be served at a cocktail lounge. Life is not about instant gratification. If you want your order taken and a drink in front of you within 2 mins of setting foot at the bar, then go to a dive bar. If you want a cocktail that is made with pride and care, be prepared to wait. Cocktail lounges and dive bars are not the same thing. Would you go to Gordon Ramsey's gourmet burger restaurant and expect to have your food in front of you within 5 mins of being seated? No, you'd go to McDonald's.  5) Don't start your review with the  words \"I'm a vegan\" No-one cares.  6) Don't spend 30 mins in a venue and give a 3 star review, then state it's because you didn't have enough time to give them an appropriate evaluation. Why the fudge are you reviewing them in the first place? Full of self importance and hurting a business' livelihood just to indulge your e-peen.  7) Don't deduct a star because you walked in at 7pm without a reservation and had to wait 30mins for a table. Whose fault is it you're disorganized and think you're special? The restaurant? News flash, you're not special. You're waxed mustache and ironic t-shirt are almost identical to the guy sitting at table 3.  8) Why on God's green earth would you deduct a star because the venue is \"too busy\"!?!? Punish the venue for being good at what they do and attracting business...that's the spirit.  Seriously...1st world problems for people who apparently have a 1st world education. Petty complaints for people looking for reasons to be unhappy. Enjoy life; we're here for a good time not a long time, so make the most of it.  Herbs and Rye is a great place; the food is superb and the cocktails are even better. Staff are awesome if you don't go out of your way to be a jerk. Go in with the right attitude and you'll have a great time.",

We called a few places and had no luck. I saw that this restaurant wasn't to far down the street, (Avoiding the strip at all costs), the reviews were good and the pictures made the place look classy.   I called and a young lady answered the phone and before I could ask about wait times, she put me on hold. I was on hold for at least 7 minutes and I hung up. He said we should still try it and if it's to busy, we could keep looking. So when pulling up, I didn't like the look of it, just by the neighborhood. We found a parking spot and soon as we start to walk to the door of the restaurant, some man seen us and said \"Well look at you two\" We were dressed pretty nice. I think he was coming from the bar next door..  So I meet up with the hostess that had me on hold, and while standing there, she answers the phone and puts the person on hold. lol. I just giggled knowing that person will be waiting a while. Now that I am standing in the building, my whole outlook changed. It was dim lighting, not noisy and also not busy! We had no wait time!! We got seated right away, and in the back to ourselves. The service was so good, and they were always around when you needed them.   We started with a appetizer, which was the crab cake. I had never had one before and can I say I am officially obsessed with them now. We both wanted more after licking the plate clean. It was great, from the sauce, to the fish being cooked perfect.  Our dinner was, Spinach Pappardelle, and a steak, with sides of Mac & Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. We could not stop talking about how good the food was. We would take a bite and rave about it more. I don't even like steak, and I could not keep my fork off his plate! We got so lucky with this place, on such a busy night. This place I swear found us, instead of me finding it. Perfect Valentines Day!!",

When they cut the steak they should know the temperature of the steak but no, they just serve it anyway. Truffle mac & cheese felt as if precooked and crumbling dry.

As we were seated, I got an opportunity to look around more take in all of the chic 1920's atmosphere, it was like being in a speakeasy. We looked through the menu for food and apps, but I could not take my eyes off of the drink area. That part of the menu was set up to show you era each cocktail was from- very cool!  Finally, we were ready to order. We got the calamari as our appetizer, which has a cherry popper aioli, prosciutto, and banana peppers. I've never had calamari with the aioli, but it was delicious- my mouth was pleasantly surprised. As our main courses, I ordered the \"Flat Iron steak, medium rare, with garlic spinach.\" The boyfriend got a \"NY Strip steak, medium rare, with Broccoli and Sharp cheese.\" Our food was wonderful, cooked perfectly, and seasoned well, we were satisfied.  As for our server, he did a fantastic job, he was friendly and attentive. I will be back for sure, next time I have to try the craft cocktails.",

It's steakhouse with an incredible bar. Their drinks are wonderful and the customer service outstanding. The place is cozy, and I love love love the music  selection. They play jazz, the doors, jimmy hendrix, just really really great music.  It's become one of my favorite spots",

It's an amazing place for a True classic cocktail experience, and it's all done with great execution.   The cocktails themselves are reasons to veer off the strip, but the bartender Emily is a reason to make it a priority. She was knowledgeable and hilarious. She had such a super lovable personality that we decided to make a reservation in that same night to try their steaks for the late night happy hour (12am-2am). Unfortunately we didn't make it back, only because we physically weren't able too...apparently it's illegal or something to drive drunk.",

Frankly, that is just laziness and a complete lack of concern for the customer. When addressed to the server, he responded \"I'll sleep easy tonight either way.\"    The mac and cheese was very good. The steaks were average. As addressed above, the experience was poor due to their seemingly anti-customer attitude. In fact, the bottom of the menu is littered with multiple disclaimers that go against the customer. It gets two stars only because the music and the ambiance are great. If they would just shift their focus to a more customer friendly one, this place would rate four stars easily.   UPDATE: I lowered it to one star because of the condescending response below. That was exactly the attitude of the server when we politely asked about splitting the check. This place treats its customers like they are an annoyance.",

These steaks for half off are a steal. The truffle Mac & cheese was delicious. A light truffle taste, but the Mac is very cheesy with a good consistency. Didn't take any flash pictures to capture the low light ambiance in the joint. Definitely one of the best happy hours in town.",

The steaks were so tender and the steak seasoning was outstanding!  My steak was the wrong temperature, but it was so good that I wasn't going to send it back.  The thing that made this one of the worst dining experiences was the server.  He was unkind and mean at times.  It affected my entire experience. I was afraid to ask for anything that may put him in a worse mood.  He was nice at the end before he dropped the check. Being a server myself, I will learn from him and make sure I never treat a guest unkindly! If I return, I will make sure to never sit in his section.  I should have asked for a different server.  It was my first time there and wished it would have been a great memory!",

    "text": "So it was a night of culinary adventures last Friday and I finally got time to yelp about it. It started off at Herbs and Rye, which I have driven past umpteenthousand times without even noticing. The inside is very swanky, almost a Rat-Pack feel, as if Sinatra should come out of the other room telling you to scram, you're in his seat. It's the kind of place where the booze is cold and the broads are hot. (Wow, I've been waiting FOREVER to use that line in conversation.)  The food was good. Maybe I was just looking at a bar menu, but the selection seemed to be kind of small. It seemed to be like: Appetizer, Flatbread Pizza, Big Fat Steak, the end. But I ordered the hot wings, which were satisfactorily spicy. I tried some of my friend's sweet potato tater tots, but wasn't sold on them.  But the drinks... oooh lordie. If you have more than two, be prepared to have a designated driver. I ordered a Long Beach Iced Tea, which when made right should have a subtle red/fuschia color to it. Too dark means it's a weak drink; too light means too much alcohol.  The drink came back and looked less like a cocktail and more like a serving of pink lemonade Crystal Light.  Needless to say, I only ordered one.  I'm not knocking the place. If I was invited back by friends, I'd certainly go. But for such a good first impression, it kind of fizzled out.",

It is decorated very classy, dim lighting, upbeat music that I would think of for swing dancing.  Even the bathroom was decorated nice and very clean.  Our waiter, Jaquim was on point!  He was perfect. pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable.  Tonight I had the crab cake which is OMG! the best.

We started out with a ceasar salad, the dressing has a bit of a kick to dressing, it was a delisious surprise. My girlfriend had the surf and turf and I had the filet and ordered a side jalapeno cream corn. Everything was great! I would recommend getting the surf and turf though,  you get more food for your money and it comes with two sides, and the steak has a delisious red wine sauce. Service was great!",

We went to Herbs and Rye on a Thursday night in the hopes of having an amazing meal, but left heavy-hearted knowing that we probably would never return again. My husband and I have been visiting your establishment for the last 2 years during happy hour and have always had an amazing experience. We have been served by Rickey several times in the past, and left extremely satisfied and happy. I have always referred people to your establishment when asked \"Where can I get the best steak in town?\". We've brought family and friends on numerous occasions as well.  We began our dining experience this evening at 6:30 pm. We were made aware, upon ordering our food that if we were ordering a steak, to expect a 30 minute cook time. We placed our entire order at 6:40. Chorizo meatballs, Truffle Mac and Cheese and 2 Filet Mignons-cooked medium well with blue cheese topping and garlicky spinach. We anticipated our steaks to come out within the 30 minute \"window\" referenced, but they were not delivered to our table until 7:35. An entire 55 minutes later. I asked Rickey if the restaurant was short staffed that evening, to which he replied \"for happy hour, we are short-staffed in order to keep the prices low.\" When our steaks finally arrived, they were overcooked and dry. And, instead of an apology, our waiter, took out his light, and asked us to cut them in half, like we were at Chili's. He proceeded to tell me that medium-well meant light pink, to which my steak was GREY in color. He then saw they were grey and a little \"overcooked\" and would be sent back. I told him that I didn't want to wait another hour for the steaks, to which he replied \"they won't take that long, there's always steaks already on the grill.\" New steaks didn't return to the table for another 30 minutes. By this time, we've been sitting for 90 minutes. Unacceptable in my opinion. I realize it was happy hour, but this should never be an excuse as we've never encountered this before. We were told a manager was going to come to the table, but never did. By the time we received our check, it was 8:30, and we had spent enough time wallowing in this disappointing situation. I have read all of the success stories and effort to turn this restaurant around, and I have appreciated the service and food in the past. If I knew that I was going to be sitting for 2 hours, I would have gone to the strip for a better experience. I'm not generally one to write letters or complain about food not being cooked properly, as most of the time, it's rectified in a timely manner. I was even more shocked that we were about to be offered dessert as compensation, and would have had to sit another 30 minutes. We politely declined. I've given the GM and the kitchen manager 4 days to contact me via reply to my numerous emails, but so far, they have not. It's a complete shame they don't have their act together in keeping local visitors who used to visit monthly.",

Dinner consisted of the family style portion of the linguine and clams.  Great flavor and good sized portion.  It would be great to automatically bring up the proper bowls And utensils to we could enjoy dinner. We were too full for dessert.  Another cool feature are the cocktails.  They have quite the throwback list and crush their ice in a bag, old fashioned style.    Definitely a spot to try if you're looking for a new place to eat and drink!!!  ***  ADDITION TO THE REVIEW  *** We went back for another dinner.  Appetizers were the same as above but we made different dinner selections.  The notable selection was the Ribeye with Green Chimichurri sauce.  DELICIOUS.  However, the one that WINS it all are the homemade donuts to order.  A total MUST!!  They are miniature donuts with powered sugar.  Absolutely finger licking good.   Not a good take home item for later though.  Once they were cold they weren't so yummy...  so enjoy hot and eat them all!",

We went there a little earlier, so we didn't get to try the happy hour, but for two drinks it was about 20$. I think thats reasonable. The docor is awesome too! 50s style, exposed brick, music in the background and the bartenders are wearing black and white. This place is very similar to Commonwealth (a bar downtown) and i will definetelly be back over and over again",

Every time I go we usually try and sit with Deborah because she's absolutely fantastic. She manages to always remember us even remembering the signature cocktail I order which is the weekend at the Waldorf ( great citrus drink to cool off this heat!) On top of the service the food is always impeccable. I also work at a steakhouse on the strip so this little hole in the wall definitely holds up with any fine dining restaurant with an added casual local feel. From the outside it may not seem like much especially considering the surrounding area, but the inside is a whole other world!",

Haven't tried the food, but sitting at the bar perusing the history lesson-cum-cocktail list, a tear almost came to my eye. If I were to open a bar, certainly this is the way I'd do it (oh wait, I did open a bar once, and we almost did it right--H&R do it better).   From classic to creative, H&R mixes with finesse. I'm a fan, and how. Oh, and the drinks cost easily half what they'd be on the Strip.",

Some of my favorites are the meatballs, the truffle mac and cheese (w/ bacon)! and especially, the spicy mussels. All expertly prepared and absolutely delicious. With an excellent happy hour lasting from 5 to 8pm and midnight to closing, you can try selected dishes at half off. The cocktails are some of the best in town, hand crafted by one of their impressive mixologists. The Ward Eight is absolutely my favorite. The soft elegant lighting makes for a perfect romantic dinner. With their great prices,  coupled with the quality of food and service I am baffled at why this place is not packed every night. Herbs & Rye is a must for everyone.",

    "text": "Came here because the lady and i had heard they have one of the best happy hours in Las Vegas. The bar it's self is pretty well-known as well. I believe they've had some of the top awards for a bar in America over the last five years or so.  If you're coming for the happy hour which is basically half off all of their steaks make sure you have reservations or show up minutes before they open up. It gets extremely packed especially in the bar. But you can score a fillet for about 25 bucks. Not one of those that you'll find one of the chain restaurants but an actual pretty decent cut and pretty decent quality.  Make sure to have a drink is well. I'd go for one of their unique craft cocktails. Not the kind of place you want to come to have a beer. We decided to have a lions tail and a last word. The bartender was super friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Everything you would expect from a place that prides themselves in being a craft cocktail bar.  We had the ribeye and the delay. Like I said both around $25-$30 each. I decided to go ahead and add the bacon and blue cheese crust to the ribeye. Both meets were cooked perfectly to order and we're both pretty decent sizes. They each come with a side as well. We got the wedge salad, simple chunk of iceberg lettuce, covered with ranch and blue cheese crumbles with bacon and tomatoes. Pretty decent size for being a side. Then we got the loaded mashed potatoes or something along that lines. Really thick and creamy with a very flavorful taste.  And dinner with a martini. Like I said not the kind of place you'd come for a regular drink. Definitely try something off of their 1920s and 1930s section. Overall an amazing place with a very knowledgeable and courteous staff and very tasty food selection.",

I was in Vegas for work, and I was so done paying premium prices for average food. A friend recommended Herbs & Rye. Surroundings seem sketchy but don't be discouraged, it's fine and it looks great inside. Enjoy the dentist ad overhead that reads - I wanna be sedated.   The vibe is awesome, dark, relaxing, good music - our server was amazing, explained the menu, she was friendly and prompt. We made it in time for happy hour - half price steaks. I came for the drinks but now that I know steaks are half price - lets eat! Why not give it a try? It is the BEST steak, I have had in a long time.  I would go back anytime - happy hour or not. I wish all the time that this spot was closer to where I live because I would be there every weekend. I have been recommending it to everyone I know that travels to Vegas.   I had NY Strip with Herbs and Rye spice rub - medium rare. For sides I got Truffle Parmesan Fries and Truffle Mac and Cheese. My friend got Filet Mignon (medium)  with Blue Cheese crust. For sides she got garlic mashed and sweet potato tots.Temp on the steaks was perfect (I am so picky too) and it tasted so damn good.  It was amazing. All of it -perfect.    We had many drinks...there are so many choices. All organized in the most perfect way so it is not overwhelming.  They have proper bartenders.   The food is 5 stars.  The drinks - 5 stars.  Service - 10 stars (she had long dark hair and a sleeve tattoo, embarrassed that I do not remember her name).  Please, please, please open a location in Boston.",

I mean you really can't complain about half price streaks for happy hour, so I've been going there for years. But for some reason the arrogant owner, got rid of the only person who seemed to care about the place. Since he canned the manager, the place has went down the toilet (side note the bathrooms are disgusting)! Bad service, horribly loud music (unless you enjoy rap music blaring the Nword every 5 seconds) and no one who actually cares about the customer. The old manager would talk to people, make sure the orders were right, and made you feel like you were welcome. Not any more!   And crap sandwich, don't sit down 30 seconds before  happy hour or you will be charged full price for your entire meal. Seriously 11:59 and charged full price. Never would have happened with the last manager who cared about the customer and keeping people come back. So 64 bucks for a steak that was over cooked Wal-Mart meat.   The owner doesn't seem to care about this business anymore and seems focused on his other steakhouse cleaver where they serve the same food at higher prices. He's let \"erbs and ry\" fall into disrepair. That's not a typo, that's literally what his sign has said for the last year. Guy seems to have given up... signs are falling apart, wrong phone numbers on the building, trash everywhere in the alley, disgusting front with garbage everywhere.. no good!  Done with erbs and ry!!!!",

Came for a friends birthday and we got to try many items off the menu.  They are big portions so you can share. Some of the plates are moderately priced, but worth it.

The figs were perfection sprinkled around the savory goodness of a pork chop and mashed potatoes.   Made a reservation and was seated right away. The ambiance is nice. A little on the dark side but not horrible. Killed the mood a bit to have to keep turning on my phone to see the menu, but obviously that only takes a few minutes. Our sever was extremely friendly and helpful. When Bubs got a cocktail he wasn't a fan of she offered to switch it out for him. All of the food was great. The little neck clam appetizer is addicting. We requested more bread to soak up the sauce, but I couldn't wait and continued to shovel spoonfuls into my face. PORK and FIGS people. If you love sweet and savory just order it. Bub's flat iron steak was good, but he was in love with his whiskey potatoes (yes you read that right). Those potatoes are so unique, and even as someone who is not a fan of whiskey I very much enjoyed them. The drink menu is dope. Every drink has a story and the list is organized by the time periods they came from. Mostly gin and burbon stuff but I found a rum drink that was refreshing. Who would have thought pineapple and mint would work so well together?   Great place to celebrate our anniversary. Looking forward to coming back!",

I checked their online reservation at 5:45 pm and was fortunate to reserved a 630 slot. I called that we were 10 minutes late and they were fine with it. We walked in and got seated at the bar section immediately.  Our waiter and busboy were awesome, too bad we didn't take their names. They have happy hours from 5-8pm, which includes 50% off their steak and some appetizers.   We ordered spicy mussels and Caesar salad for our starters. The mussels were very scrumptious but not really spicy. This is our of our favorites! Salad is a big portion, better than most average salad. I ordered their 16 oz rib eye medium, which was perfectly cooked! The steak was very succulent. I had to take home 1/2 of it as I got very full from the appetizers. My husband ordered the flat steak. He enjoyed it as well. Again, it was a perfect medium cooked steak. Our steak orders came with choice of 1 side dish. I had the jalapeno cream corn and my husband picked the truffle fries. Loved the corn but the fries were just okay.  As for our drinks, I had a glass of the Castoro Cabernet Sauvignon which was perfect for me. It did not leave an strong aftertaste. I don't like \"strong and bitter\" wines  . Hubby ordered Vieux Carre and Boulevadier, which he also really enjoyed. The former was served in a martini glass which was a no-no for him so he requested the latter in a scotch glass with an ice cube. There was a $1.50 up charge for the ice cube though :( He ordered one that he didn't like much and the waiter was kind enough to take it back with no charge. That made up the ice cube up charge :) . We top off our night with a cup of coffee and an order of creme brulee. The desert was not too sweet, which made it magnificent!  Overall, we loved this place and we will be back for more!!!",

I hyped this place up to coworkers and everyone ordered a steak. Bland as can be, I knew early on I was not the only one when our CFO asked for salt and pepper and generously added both to his steak.  Great start and I still love you Herbs and Rye but not sure I can take a chance on your steaks again.",

If someone is calling in and asking about the conditions of the bar seating availability, you should not lie and pretend it's all open when you can barely enter the room.  The venue caters to people who think the offstrip location is cheaper or cooler but this venue and service and loudness does not really provide a good experience if you ask me.  --- The manager wrote a response, the response he wrote tells you why it is not worth going to.

The bartender struggled to make a vodka him let and sent our server back to ask what went into it... Kind of surprising since this is a classic cocktail? When it came back, it was good, but still not served correctly. No bigs, just surprising since I assumed the bartenders here were experts in classic cocktails.   The food was okay, but honestly I would not come back again for a meal. We had the angel hair pasta (underwhelming), calamari, and truffle fries (surprisingly bland). Stick to the drinks here.  And lastly, I'm removing a star because the server (was not only standoffish) but also spent the entire time flirting with our friend, all the while clearly wearing a wedding ring. Tacky!",

    "text": "What took me so long?!?!? Oh Man, Herbs & Rye is where it's at!  I was privileged last Saturday to leave work early enough to have dinner with my handsomest husband. On our way to another spot, light bulb lit up and we turned around to make our way to Herbs & Rye. Best decision I could have made. I enjoyed the experience so much, we wanted to return the very next day! On a Saturday night (around 10pm), plenty of tables were opened and my kind of music was playing. I honestly wasn't hungry but wasn't going to pass on sampling some eats, especially since I've been wanting to try Herbs & Rye for a while. I opted for the Bruschetta Flat Bread, and Caramel Apple Bread Pudding. The hubs got the NY Strip with Whiskey Shallot Potatoes. Bruschetta Flat Bread was light and refreshing. Perfect as an appetizer or something to nibble on. Caramel Apple Bread Pudding came with a scoop of vanilla icecream which makes all the difference for me. Honestly not the best bread pudding I've ever had, but pretty good. The NY Strip was REALLY good! Seared on the outside and tender on the inside. Had that great char flavor. Whiskey Shallot Potatoes were recommended by our server, BOMB! The flavors in this side were fantastic! Savory, creamy, with an orgasmic kick.  We also sipped on some of the best cocktails in Vegas. Yes! I SAID IT! Weekend at the Waldorf and Pina Colada from the Rat Pack Era were amazing. Don't sleep on the Pina Colada, this one isn't the packet mix type that are served everywhere else. It's unique but carries some of that expected flavor.  Another star of the show is Joaquin. Exceptional service, honestly. He was knowledgeable of the menu- drinks and food, made great suggestions - the whiskey potatoes were his suggestion, friendly, polite, attentive in the best kind of way. He never came up to talk to us while we were engaged in conversation or had our mouth's full. NOT ONCE. With the corner of my eye, I'd see him look over while passing (show's his attentiveness) but not approach the table when it wasn't a good time. I truly appreciate that. Never have I ever had a server who was so intuned. Joaquin is who kicked our experience up to 5 Stars.",

If it's good enough for the chefs, it's good enough for me!  Their extensive cocktail menu is phenomenal with drinks from every era dating back from 1776. The pours are stiff and the best player in the restaurant scene, bar none.   Mary Pickford -- A powerhouse combination of rum, pineapple, Grenadine and Maraschino served in a wide bowl champagne glass. Aside from the drink being fruitastic, it is so strong it'll put hair on your chest. I wasn't able to finish the drink as I wanted to be able to remember my impending meal. Not sure which cocktail I'll order on my next visit but I'm sure it will not disappoint.  Spicy Mussels -- Mussels cooked in a rich, tomato stew with white wine. Not one did not disappoint. Each and every one were plump and juicy. Make sure you dip them in the flavorful stew as it adds that spiciness. This item is listed under their appetizers but they give you so much, I was more than satisfied eating this as my entree.   Their Happy Hour is undeniably one of the best in the game. Who else has filet mignon and ribeye on their HH menu? The restaurant is not too far from The Strip and is one of the few places I recommend you go out of your way for.",

    "text": "In the search for the perfect cocktail bar to drink at and have a snack - Herbs and Rye came up in every list. I had to try it for myself and I'll be damned if it wasn't every bit as good as advertised.  During the first few minutes at the bar I asked the bartender if they could make a particular drink I'm recently obsessed with as I've had a few tell me no (some bars won't as its very high cost with a large portion of it being bitters). He was a little bit condescending in his reply saying they aren't \"some bar\" and I'll be honest that this put a sour taste in my mouth at the beginning of the meal. I now had a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to dislike this bartender. But, to the best of my ability, I couldn't do it. He was way too damn good at his job.  We ended up having about five rounds of drinks, two of which were the bartender's choice. All of them were variations or choices from their menu (generational / historical drinks). All of them were poured well, mixed well, and delicious. The only one thing was different to what I'm used to was that the aviation I ordered was faaaar more tart than I've had before. I'm assuming this is an ingredient ratio difference, no big, it was still good. Our last two rounds of drinks were creations of his own, the last being made with a tasty black strap molasses. Lesson learned: let the bartender pick your drinks here.  Food. Oh, the food.  Did I mention their happy hour has half price steaks? As in 50% off. Whaaaaaat. So good. I got the flat iron medium rare with chimichurri on the side and a side order of bacon+brussels. Everything was delicious. The cook on the steak was maybe 5-10% under what I'm used to but I enjoy it however - this didn't detract from it at all. The chimichurri was flavorful and zesty. The Brussels sprouts were crispy and delicious.  Between my friend and I we ordered 8 drinks, had two shots, two steaks, and two side dishes. We walked out of there for less than $170 total (including tip!). I was very pleased.   Eat here!",

Cool, dark, red velvet patterned wallpaper with dark brown and black accents, very dim lighting, and old-school black upholstered booths.  Service: spot on. Nice, pleasant and to the point. Always accessible.  Food: 14oz New York Strip with truffle Mac n cheese. My only \"beef\" withy the steak was a little too much fat and gristle. Otherwise, it was seared just about right and had perfect pepper and salt seasoning. Great taste.   Probably the most notable part of this dining experience was that the steak was half off. That's right - half off during Happy Hour - 5-8pm. So I enjoyed a nice $36 NY cut for $18. That might've been the best $18 NY cut I've ever had.   I enjoyed this dining experience. If the NY was a little leaner I would've given 5/5. But 4/5 is good. I'll definitely return to try the other Meat Methods",

We had a reservation for 5pm, the time they open. We got there and stood in line for the doors to open with alot of people. When we got to the front, there was a lady in front of us, who told the hostess she was just 'going to the bar'. The next hostess was walking us to our table and that lady tried sitting at our table. Seriously running in front of me and sat in the chair. Luckily the host explained to her that the tables were reserved and she left, but I nearly had to call her out on her trying to sneak past and save a table for friends. Anyways, karma will get her...but moving on, it was happy hours and many dishes/drinks were half off. Great deals. Everyone at our table ordered steaks or pork chops and everybody was raving about their dish! Loved that I did Not feel like I was in a casino and in a real swanky restaurant with delicious food and drinks with some cool jazzy/swing music. A++++ love it! If you go..make reservations early!",

This time it was dinner in the large dining room (3 total rooms in here, this being the largest). Loud, celebratory environment with dim lights and still NO TELEVISIONS (thankfully!). My friend and I ordered a couple of New York Strips from the charming Allie (we further named her, 'bacon bringer') -- she suggested some toppings for the steaks because she is a \"stuff on top or stuff\" type of person. The steaks and the toppings did not disappoint, but the meatballs appetizer was the big winner -- spicy, savory, and hearty. The cocktails are always top shelf here, so I won't bother to write about them. But be sure to get a seat at the bar on your first visit here to watch the magic happen... and if you're lucky like I've been, the bartenders will recommend some recipe books for you.",

Yes, the steak was pretty good, but I'm not sure if I would be willing to return to wait an eternity.   Also, I completely understand that the waiter has no control over how fast the food will come out, but it would have been nice if we were offered more bread in between or gave us an update on what's going on. When it came to paying, our server split the checks into two for us (for two couples). We got our receipt back and signed for the credit card, but he never gave my friend that paid in cash his change..um..did he assume that was his tip or something?? Unprofessional. We didn't bother to ask about this as we were already here for way too long. My friend obviously didn't leave a tip cause he just kept the money..  On the bright side..they are on top of refilling your water. Keep in mind I drank a lot of water when I was waiting for 45 minutes. Yep, there was always a full cup of water.",

Not that I frequent here on a weekly basis but I've been in quite a few times.   Their menu is American fare with a focus on Steaks. They do have an decent seafood menu with clam and fish etc. I love their Happy Hour which is half off for all items with stars next to them on the menu. It's a great deal if your craving steaks! I personally adore their linguini & clams pasta in a white wine and garlic sauce. It's savory and portion size is decent for its price. The steaks I have mix feelings about. My gals and I ordered the flat iron and NY strip and each was requested to be cooked medium rare however the NY came out a little too rare. Too rare too tough, but whatever floats your boat.  The service provided last evening was pretty how shall I say crappy. We began at the bar and as always the bartenders were great. There were 4 of us so we dined at a booth. It's busy I get it and it's late night but it doesn't mean you should be understaffed and the guests should have to suffer for it. We waited a pretty long time after our food order, my stomach was coming alive!!Probably why we received many items on the house. Unfortunately, we had to remind our server several times of certain requests and it took another bjillion years on the check. Oi, hopefully it won't happen in the future and we will just sit at the bar.",

The drinks were beyond imagination of mixology.   Food: We had ordered the calamari appetizer with prosciutto, banana peppers and a creamy spicy aioli. Probably one of the best calamari I have had in a long time.  My boyfriend ordered the steak with their garlic mashed potatoes and I ordered the spicy clam and linguini. I think that the pasta was just tossed with the clam juice and white wine with pepper flakes which was just delicious. We ordered a side of truffle fries too that was just adorable.  I couldn't leave without desert and ordered their cookie and ice cream which was an cookie cooked on a skillet with 3 scoop of ice cream. Think pazookie.   Everything was great and definitely was blown away at the service and the food quality! 5 dang starssss!!!",

    "text": "Sweet baby Jesus?! We have arrived.   Now this is how I can imagine old Vegas was when wheelin' & dealin' were going on behind close doors drinking prohibition type cocktails served under a clouds of smoke....  The last time we hit up the Herb we strolled in on a Friday night/early Saturday morning around 130AM to make it to happy hour. Yes, I said it - Happy Hour! Only this super cool joint would have a happy hour between 12AM-3AM. What a great way to get into Vegas and begin your epic adventures in Sin City.   Everything on the menu is on point. I will always opt to add the chimimcurri sauce to any steak order. Tried the pepper corn sauce during this recent visit and although the sauce is good, my mind was on the chimumcurri the entire time.   Take some time to check out all the drink options that they have. You never know, you might find a new concoction to try out. I always tend to immediately have a mule but with the options at the Herb, you have to try something new....  I love the atmosphere. Everyone who is there is there to have a good time and that's it. Non-pretentious place to hang out with friends or spark up a convo with one of the bartenders.   Don't let the dark building exterior or lack of a parking lot deter you from this place. Its seriously the place to be. Woot!",

We were blown away by the food. Truly amazing place to have steak and a few drinks. We ordered the bistecca flatbread, ribeye steak with red pepper sauce, New York strip with mushrooms and onions, whiskey scallop potatoes and sprouts and swine. It was delicious. Plus you order your steak according to their scale and they will cook to perfection. Great place for locals or if your traveling to Las Vegas and want to try something off the strip. Very easy to find. Make sure to get there early or make a reservation. By the time we left there was a line out the door!",

Designed in a style somewhere between \"Old time Vegas\" and stripped-down speakeasy with a less-than-ideal location on West Sahara it was with eyes still adjusting from the 6pm sun that I entered the small tavern and greeted at a small podium by the woman later to be my waitress I was quickly led to my choice of tables, a menu soon in hand presenting tough decisions with a resultant four item order divided into two courses accompanied by one of nearly a dozen gin based cocktails I'd have liked to try were my liver's capacity on par with that of my gut.  Obviously a space prone to becoming lively as the night wears on but only perhaps half-full during the course of my meal it was after perhaps a ten minute wait that my cocktail arrived and featuring a lovely balance of fruit juxtaposing juniper notes beneath a cloudy of foam the Clover Club was a hit, the flavor profile particularly refreshing when matched to a rich opening duo of tender macaroni unfortunately overwhelmed with truffle oil and a crisp, lightly charred flatbread that fared far better with briny bacon finding its foil in the tang of creme fraiche.   At this point debating an Aviation versus the Bee's Knees it was a bit to my surprise that my second round arrived immediately on the heels of my first and forgetting the second cocktail as it was likely to arrive far too late to be enjoyed with the food I instead dug straight in, the 12oz bone-in piece of pork seared perfectly and coated with bleu over hand-smashed potatoes amidst a jus of pork and poached figs, the later laying split alongside the protein and still intensely sweet...though certainly not as much so as a bowl of tender tots bathed in a pool of honey beneath snowcaps of toasted marshmallow that ranks amongst the best \"sides\" I've had this year.  At this point sated but happy to go another round it was to an oral explanation of the restaurant's desserts that I was finally treated and although large sharing portions of sugared doughnuts and a skillet cookie were hard to resist it was instead in the day's special that I partook, the piping hot chunk of booze-soaked baguette crowned by a ball of vanilla ice cream proving very 'special' indeed with butter and cinnamon bubbling at its base as if the kitchen had known I was coming and prepared it just for me.",

Overall experience left my rating at one star. We had a party of 9 which we made a reservation for 7:30 so they can accommodate us. We all arrive on time to wait an hour and half to find they seated another party of the same size that arrived after us first. When approached, they pulled all the excuses out of the book and apologized profusely but once I'm \"hangry\", apologies mean nothing. We're sat, we order, and like I mentioned, the food was good but expect to wait for it. We were sent a few free appetizers which made us temporarily happy until we received our bills. For me and my boyfriend, our bill was almost $200. This included a recommended drink that I did not like, a coke that was $7 because he said I've \"got to have the one from the bar\" and a 30% tip on each bill. Generous much?! So we pretty much paid for the \"free appetizers\" that we didn't ask for. Waiting for every single thing felt like eternity. Good luck to those who still will try this place. O hope your experience is better than ours.",

The Cesar salad is still one of the best I have had, but the steaks don't really justify the price anymore. The home made donuts are still great. the seating is cramped and tables too small if you want to order a bunch of food family style.

It is a bar so you do have to be 21 or over to get in  it's very dimly lit, had to use my phone flashlight just to see the menu  Servers we courteous and very helpful   Back to the drink menu... even if you can't decide what you want you can just tell the bartender what types of things you like, the type of alcohol and the flavors you prefer and they will put together your own personalized drink.

The server stated to the bartender he's starring at me just make another drink. He didn't. So I got up, threw the receipt book with $20 tip inside and walked out. He shouted Oh ill make you another, I replied, STICK IT. In my opinion, the bartenders an asshole, failed to make another drink and when I was walking out the door offered.

Wasn't too keen on the food, unfortunately.  I really wanted to be wowed, but, all of us agreed that the food was just OK.    The pasta, pork chops and 2 different steak cuts were well priced and of decent quality, just, nothing any of us would order again.  The truffle mac and cheese was dry and lacking flavor.  And the brussels sprouts tasted like they just threw cheese and bacon on them, but it just didn't \"mesh\" well.  Too bad, because I read other Yelpers swearing how yummy both are.  Come for a round of drinks and the cool atmosphere!  Then, head out for dinner...",

My favorite waiter, Ronnie, informed me the last time I was there that the new manager has instituted a very high corkage policy that is nothing short of punitive. Given that this restaurant has a very limited, not to mention mediocre, wine selection, punishing wine collectors like me is a breathtakingly stupid policy.  Here's a math lesson for this boy-wonder manager, who will no doubt be managing an Arby's in the future: Fair corkage in a restaurant should be the cost of the lowest-priced glass of wine on the menu....which is what I had.  That means the restaurant made a few dollars on the sale. If they had charged me the same as that glass of wine to open my bottle, let's say $12, that would have been pure profit....and they wouldn't have lost a customer.  So stupid.",

    "text": "Made reservations for this past weekend. Upon arriving, no one was at the host stand. After waiting a few minutes, a server came to the host stand to get us seated. Turns out this was going to also be our server. This was my second time here. First was good, did not recall any issues. Unfortunately this visit was not so great.   Service was not good and it was not that busy. The bar area looked fairly busy but it was just as happy hour was ending. The dining room area was not busy. After being seated and getting some water to start, we waited for the server to come back to get our drink order. By the time drinks came back, we were ready to order. After placing our order (main plus a side). the server came back to inform us they were out of mashed potatoes. Really? Um, ok. So I picked another side. Once we did get our food, the steaks were luke warm. Being hungry and not having a server check on us or both trying to flag down someone else, we just took what we got.  Unlike other restaurants where the server stops by to check on things, we didn't see much of our server after that. I remember one visit to check after we had our food and take a second drink order. Once finished and plates were cleared we wanted to get the check, but where was the server? No where to be seen. Then he shows up to ask about dessert and leave a menu, which we declined and just asked for the check. Soon as we got the check, I put my CC in hoping to have it taken back promptly, but no, the server disappeared again. After the check with my CC was sitting for a bit, someone else offered to take it for us. That other server than came back by to let us know our server was taking care of it.   In the end, I was disappointed since I know this is a popular place, they have a great drink menu and on my previous visit loved the food. However this recent visit was not worth a higher rating. I most likely won't be coming back anytime soon. There are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.",

We also had some food which was also very delicious. Thank you Matt for such great service and fine beverages.",

    "text": "First off, the food here definitely deserves a 5/5. The one star deduction comes from the service.   I kept hearing about this place, and finally decided to try it out. I was told to definitely go for the happy hour - and everybody was right (half-off all well drinks, almost all steaks and some seafood). With that said, try one of their craft cocktails; there are easily 50 to choose from. For the quality and flavor, $11 is a steal.   My dinner partner liked the spicy mussels we ordered as an appetizer, but I found them to be a bit heavy handed on the oregano.   We ordered the NY strip and a filet mignon, asparagus, Mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts with honey swine - and not a bite disappointed. Absolutely stellar food. The chef even came around and asked several tables if everything was to their liking. Very personable, and a nice touch.   My only complaint was the service. Our server was sometimes hard to find, and incredibly slow bringing drinks. They were busy, but given the relatively small size of the venue, there's no way it took the bartender 15 minutes to pour two glasses of wine. We ordered as soon as we were served dinner (would have ordered before, but the waiter was nowhere to be seen) and had to stop eating halfway through so we could have some food left to enjoy with the wine.   I will definitely be back (can't beat $128 for phenomenal steaks, sides, 4 drinks and an appetizer), with fingers crossed for a better server.",

The vibe and the aesthetics remind me of Capo's! Except Capo's is cleaner (women's bathroom had a bad odor). Also Capo's has better tasting quality food!  The reason why I gave this place three stars is because the food definitely is overpriced. We ordered the spicy mussels, the sauce was tasty and so was the French bread to dip it with, but the mussels tasted freezer burnt....awful! Beef carpaccio was extra salty even without eating the capers...yikes! The penne pasta - over cooked prosciutto and over powering garlic sauce....eeeek! Jalapeno cream corn was ok - the best out of all the dishes but still lacking flavor. We did end the night with the half order of donuts....yum! It was well worth the calories! Overall I would come back for drinks and service definitely grabbing a bite somewhere else before heading there!!!",

The bar is True to the mixology style and have a great selection of 'original' drink recipes.  Non gaming (which is so refreshing) and plays upbeat jazz type music. Joe and Elrey were fantastic and knowledgeable behind the bar. I loved the attention to detail. We had the Penne Pasta, Flat iron Steak and mashed potatoes all of which I would recommend.  Of the many cocktails I tried my 2 favorites were the Jack Rose and the Blood and Sand.  My first time tasting a shot of Fernet after dinner and the only way to describe it is WOW!

    "text": "Definitely a local gem and an all time fav of me and my SO. If planning to go during happy hour (seriously the best happy hour in Vegas and the best deal if planning to dine here, IMO), be sure to make a reservation! This place gets busy and parking can be a bit hard to come by when its busy, so try to car pool or take a cab.   The outside makes it look a bit shady, but I love the dark, moody decor and lighting inside. Such a big part of a great dining experience to me. All the servers we've had have always been super nice and extremely helpful with any questions and offering up suggestions.   We always get a few different cocktails (even though they aren't included in the happy hour specials). We like our drinks on the sweeter side, so some of our favorites are the Zombie, Harvey Wallbanger, Painkiller, and Mark Pickford. On occasion, when we're feeling adventurous, we'll go for the Bartender's Choice.   For food, the Wedge Salad is always our favorite way to start. It never disappoints. And my SO always goes for the NY strip and I get the filet, topped with onions and mushrooms. For sides, the garlic mash is always solid and the sweet potato tots are good too. The steaks have always been cooked perfectly to our liking and are tender and flavorful. They offer lots of add-on options for the steaks as well.  The only negative is that it is a bit pricey when not dining during happy hour. I spent significantly more dining here when it wasn't happy hour, than I did dining at Vinter Grill, which is a more upscale restaurant.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time since I have heard amazing things about their food and drinks. I finally talked the boyfriend into it for their happy hour.   First of all, there is hardly anything on the happy hour. 2 wines and a few well cocktails. Of course we wanted to try their famous cocktails which were not on the happy hour. They were $11-$13 each. We ordered Moscow mules and they were tasty. There also isn't very much food on the happy hour unless you're there for steaks which are 50% off but even at that discount are still pretty pricy. I am a vegetarian and when we mentioned there weren't many vegetarian options the bartender said \"nope there sure isn't\". Now I am a server and am always trying to accommodate vegetarians, vegans, gluten free etc and always have a few great suggestions to throw out. This guy wasn't even trying. Without his help we found some options. We ordered a caprese salad which was amazing, a Mediterranean flatbread, also tasty, and the truffle Mac n cheese which was bland and not very truffley. But overall the food and drinks were very good.   My biggest complaint was the service. Now granted we sat at the bar and ordered apps and drinks but the 2 bartenders really seemed to not care about us at all. They never checked on us and we were constantly trying to get their attention so we could order. When we finally did they acted like we were an inconvenience. At one point we had been waiting forever for the check and we needed to get going and so my boyfriend after finally flagging down the bartender handed him his credit card and asked politely if he could please run it for the tab. The bartender grabbed his card and threw it on the back bar and then walked away. We then waited another 10 mins for him to process it. It was very rude.   Our total for 2 people was $90 and we had 2 drinks each and those few food items I mentioned. Incredibly overpriced and poor service? Needless to say we won't be returning.",

    "text": "After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$.   I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake.   April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no.   Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.  And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.",

I was visiting a friend over the weekend and we came here twice. Both times for reverse happy hour and both experiences were phenomenal. First time was a Thursday night, we sat at the bar Gerardo took care of us and he was absolutely wonderful. He made great drinks and he's so genuine and kind, he truly made my night. I ordered the New York strip, my friend the filet mignon and we both got the truffle mac and cheese. The steak was honestly one of the best I've ever had, cooked perfectly and the mac and cheese melts in your mouth, like it was heavenly. The second time was a Saturday, it was busy which was to be expected but we were seated at a table within 10 minuets. Our servers were fantastic, so helpful and kind. We got the spicy muscles and oh my god they were bomb. The sauce that it's served with was so delicious that we took the leftovers home and our server hooked us up with some extra bread to go with it. Once again the steaks were perfect and since I loved it so much, I got the mac and cheese again. I cannot wait to go back to Vegas and visit Herbs & Rye again. I'll rave about this place to everyone who will listen.",

Our server was attentive and recommended just about everything on the menu as his favorite (thanks for the \"help\" deciding right!) We spent $130 including tip, our usual spot is at least $200 before tip so my husband was really happy. Most of what we ordered was half off since it was happy hour, score!   I ordered the punisher for a cocktail which was amazing, not too much alcohol taste just the way I prefer. My husband the zombie which he enjoyed but was too strong for me. For our appetizer we got the clams which came with a baguette. I really loved this dish! I did manage to get clam juice all over my dress and was brought club soda which was really nice! My husband ordered the prime rib with a side of button mushrooms and I the New York strip with the house rub and my side of garlic mashed potatoes (I really wish they had a creamed spinach or vegetable medley). My husbands steak was perfection, mushrooms delicious! My steak came with a light chili drizzle! Now, I'm not one for anything too spicy so my first though was oh shit... what did I just order?! It was amazing! Not too spicy at all! I'd highly recommend the house rub! I didn't find the mashed potatoes too garlic flavored which usually is a deal breaker for me but I was too excited about the amazing steak to care.   We really loved this place and certainly will be back!",

She was very helpful in assisting me make a good decision based on what I was feeling like at the time.  Another thing I liked about this place was the dress code.  You can dress either casual or nice to it if you'd like.  It's not strict like some places, and if you've been out and about and haven't had time to go back and change, its a good spot.

    "text": "Decent steak prices... pushy service.  This place in the in the hood.  It looks ghetto from the outside but actually very nice inside.  We had reservations at 5:30 and their Happy Hour is 5-8, however, nobody was being let in and nobody from the restaurant was telling the growing crowd what was going on, which was beyond frustrating.  There were delivery people trying to get in but they wouldn't let them either.    They finally opened the doors at 6pm and checked in.  #NOTE;   If you want a booth... you have to reserve it while you're making the reservation.  Who knew?  You'd think with the 1,000 questions the staff asks you while ordering, this would have been something they would have mentioned... but I guess it's not an 'add on', they don't care.  We got seated and IMMEDIATELY, \"What kind of cocktails can I get you?\"  I mean, as we were sitting down and not even looking at the menu yet.  We asked for a minute and literally got a minute, \"Decided on some cocktails yet?\"  Geez-us.  We asked for water for now and she was clearly upset.  Like, relax with the pushiness, we'll friggin' order cocktails.  Then she came back again, like a minute late and we finally got something without looking, not knowing what \"Happy Hour\" entailed.  I ordered a Riesling, my friend's boyfriend got a Stella... neither was a Happy Hour price, as we hadn't really had a chance to look things over yet.    So, their Happy Hour... the 'big draw' are the steaks.  It's crazy how they're listing them around $40-$48 a cut, like this is a top tier steakhouse on the strip... pretty laughable actually.  However, you get \"half off\"... bringing the price to EXACTLY being slightly overpriced.  It got a NY Strip... there was some gristle here and there, not the best cut of beef, not the worst... just like a typical steak you'd get at a super market.  Clearly it wasn't aged (which sounds 'snooty', but for the $40ish price point, you expect that).    There are TWO wines on the \"Happy Hour\" list and very mediocre ones.  I just had the Reisling, which was good.      Now, here's the kick in the balls... the \"bacon.\"  When we're ordering, the waitress kept asking, \"With bacon?\"  Does it come with it?  Dunno... \"Um, sure.\"  Like idiots, we got it all around, not realizing how much extra it was.  $3!!!  She didn't mention it would be more but you assume it's like $1 or something.  So, we got bacon on the fries, the mashed potatoes, etc.  Guess what that $3 gets you... um, literally, ONE SLICE OF BACON.  ONE.  Uno.  \"A\" slice of bacon... placed on top of the fries.  The hell are you going to do with that!?  Chop it up and hide how cheap you are, at least!      Anyway... the side.  Very average.  The mac and cheese sucks, very bland, almost chalky. Fries are okay but the cheese isn't melted - it's just room temperature cheese thrown on some fries... with a slice of bacon curled up, laying on top. Brussel sprouts are shockingly good. Mashed potatoes are good.   This place was just a huge letdown.  The pushiness of the \"upsells\" from the waitress combined with the lackluster sides, the average cuts of the steaks, not being let in (and no explanation), and everything else just kinda blew it for us.",

The service is not so great. We waited an hour and 10 minutes for bread. An hour and 30 minutes  for our food. We were seated at 8:05 and don't be fooled the manager said that he could not give us the happy hour prices as the computers and menus change over automatically. After reading some of the other reviews I know now that that is not True. The service was nothing special and you have to pay automatic gratuity. Overall the food  is spectacular but it wasn't worth the hassle.",

WE both really enjoyed the atmosphere and the wonderful attentive staff, great job Mike! The Bistecca Flatbread was a light and tasty appetizer, especially with the spinach on top. Our main course was the Ribeye, truffle mac'n'cheese and asparagus....oh my god! Let me just say that was the BEST steak I ever ate. Oh and to actually have their steaks on the happy hour menu was the icing on the cake.   The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars was because we waited 1 hour for our main course. When we arrive we were the 2nd couple in the dining area we were seated at. However, by the time we order it was full, but most of all them seated after us was already eating. I understand the business, but that was a little too long and seeing others eating wasn't helping my hunger pains lol!   BUT I will NOT hold that against them. WE will return and also tell others about them! =)",

    "text": "Some very good friends of ours highly recommended H & R. The Happy Hour menu seemed like a really great deal. So after reading all the reviews,  we decided to invite my husbands boss and wife out to celebrate his birthday. We made a reservation for Saturday night at 7:45pm. We arrived a little early, and the very pleasant hostess showed us right to our table.  Aly, our server was pleasant and efficient. She gave us a quick rundown of the menu offerings and her recommendations. We took a few minutes to peruse our options. Our guests each went for the pork chop options and we decided on a New York strip and hanger steak, all 4 part of the 1/2 price Happy Hour menu. Each entree includes one side, so we collectively ordered 2 truffle mac and cheese and 2 \"sprouts and swine\" (Brussels sprouts and bacon) . We also ordered the bruschetta flatbread as an appetizer.  The food came out pretty quick, and every item was delicious and perfectly prepared.  The service was very good considering how busy the place was. I really enjoyed the intimate feeling of the bustling dining room, yet it never felt crowded or intrusive. The dim lighting added to the ambience, and the background music levels were just right. The freshly made donuts for dessert were a fantastic birthday surprise and the perfect ending to a delightful meal. We will definitely be returning sooner than later.",

We had been here back in April for my birthday and I forgot to make a review, it was just as great and they had to deal with a party of 13.   This is a must for everyone to come enjoy.

We Come From the Midwest so we know good steak. This was one of the best steaks that I've had in a long long time.  We went during the happy hour special which was, I believe from 6:30 to 8. Steaks for half price and some appetizers for half price period  If you went during regular times, it would be pretty pricey. I believe New York strip was 46 or $48. But during happy hour half price.  Love the feel, love the old-fashioned drinks, and would definitely go back again.",

You walk in and it is very dark and looks like it hasn't been remodeled since it was The Venetian Italian restaurant 30 years ago. It is loud and you almost can't hear the person right next to you.  The bartenders are not personable at all and made you feel like they were doing you a favor by asking what you want to drink after sitting there for 15 minutes.  Unless you want a very few select well drinks then there is no happy hour prices. I had a martini with bottom shelf vodka for $14. My wife and friend had a $14 glass of chardonnay that you can buy in any grocery or liquor store for $12 a bottle. They have two appetizers that you get 50% off and some select steaks that are already twice as expensive for the quality that you get ($65 for a ribeye?). Not at all what we were expecting and definitely won't be back.",

My buddy & I dropped in at 1am after doing a long gig on the strip one night. Our server was awesome. His name was Joe, I think. He was attentive, & professional, while joking around with us. The drinks were well made, although my chilled house vodka was a bit watered down. My buddy ordered the Pabst Blue Ribbon NA beer. We were laughing about it until we tasted it. It was probably one of the best non alcoholic beers I've ever tasted! The filet mignon was nice. My buddy had the NY. Both steaks were cooked properly, & had a ton of flavor. We also had corn, & mushrooms. Both were good. I would never pay full price for a meal here, but the 50% discount makes it worth a trip",

They play really good soul music as well.  The menu is simple & straightforward. We had an awesome waitress who said she worked there since opening. She knew the food and drink menus inside and out and gave fantastic suggestions.  Even the starter bread & butter was delish. I think sourdough fresh & hot with real butter.  Little neck clams are a MUST! Super delicate with garlic sauce that just melt in your mouth. I ordered the pork chop with figs. Off the charts. The cut was thick but super tender and melty. The sweetness from the figs & saltiness from pork was perfect match. My boyfriend had the filet which was also melty & buttery. Mashed potatoes and spinach very flavorful. Our cocktails also super delish. I had the painkiller which was sort of like a pina coladas but had a nice kick. My boyfriend also had cocktails that had his fave bourbon & Absinthe!!  Happy Hour everyday too!! Will be our new steak go to!",

The happy hour meat menu is the best and the sides were delicious! My husband ordered the NY strip steak with the garlic mashed potatoes and I ordered the filet mignon with the truffle mac & cheese which were cooked and seasoned to perfection. Our server Charles aka Charlie was friendly and knowledgeable when it came to explaining the menus and the popular cocktails. I ordered the Blackthorn which was one of the recommended popular drinks and it was perfect! My husband ordered the Painkiller which was strong and worth it according to him lol. For dessert we ordered the fresh fried donuts which were melt in your mouth yummy! The lighting is a little dark and took some getting used to,but nothing to keep us away.  Overall we would definitely come back here for the fast and friendly service and of course for the delicious food. I recommend making a reservation because this restaurant does get busy.",

    "text": "Everything about this place is perfect. The last time I was here was for a celebratory dinner with my company.   Let's start with the ambiance of the restaurant. From the outside you wouldn't recognize at all how amazing this place is. The dim lighting, the bar area, even the way the staff dress, gives it a cool vibe and the music is always on point. It is a small space, but you quickly get over that when you order your drink   Which bring us to our first destination- the drinks. Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures as of yet and I have been here 3 times, (I go more for the great atmosphere than to take pictures). They have mixologists and they know everything there is to know about alcohol, and creating the perfect blend of all the mixtures to make something magical. Their list of drinks goes back from the 1870's to today and they don't cut any corners.   The appetizers- our owners took us here for doing great work at our company, and they spoiled every single one of us and ordered every single one for us to eat and try and there was not a single one that was bad. The fillet mignon sliders were so tender and delicious, the mussels, perfect! My personal favorites.   Next up is the main course! So, when you order here, you have to get it al a carte style. They have every option of cut imaginable. I typically will go for the New York Strip, as that is my favorite, medium to medium well. The potatoes and macaroni & cheese are the only appropriate sides to get. The tastes, the textures, are fine tuned to make you smile and leave you feeling happy.   Lastly, desserts- again since the last time I was there, it was for a business celebratory dinner, we ordered every dessert, my favorite were the donuts which are coated in a nice sugary outer layer, lightly deep fried and come with their own dipping pouches.  My favorite is always going to be the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. I know that it is nothing special, but the taste is satisfying.    The staff that works here are all excellent at what they do and do it very well. I am not a regular here, but come when I have the time, even if you go for a drink at the bar, you can chat with the bartender and they are all friendly.",

We sat at the bar, which has the coolest looking speakeasy design. The bartender, Mike, was amazing -- not only was he super skilled in creating our drinks (we ordered the Vieux Carre, Diablo, and Aviation which were delicious and perfectly balanced), he was also very personable and made us feel very welcome. All 3 of us ordered the ribeye and shared sides (button mushrooms, truffle steak fries, and garlic spinach). The steaks were cooked perfectly (medium rare), tender and juicy. I need to find more excuses to visit again soon!",

The drinks were great - I was in a tiki mood and had the painkiller (really delicious and not too sweet). We ordered calamari, flatbread (the farmer - bacon, spinach, and a soft egg on top), and Yard Bird Risotto. The drinks were on point but the food was....delicious... holy crap the yard bird risotto was finger licking good. The chicken was crispy outside while tender and flavorful inside - complemented the risotto with it. We inhaled it within a few minutes. The flatbread was also really good (not a flatbread fan in general), the saltiness of the bacon went well with the soft egg on top. Top notch food - would like to try their half off happy hour food (steaks are half off!).  Pros: Great food and drinks, excellent happy hour for food (starts at midnight) Cons: Somewhat pricey but worth it",

We only went to the bar, but the food menu looked amazing and I'll definitely be bringing my wife here. I was the DD but can conform the drinks and atmosphere are quite awesome. One friend had a Manhattan that I sipped and it was made to perfection.   A few things to keep in mind about this place 1). It's off the beaten path. It isn't on The Strip and its locationin town is not where you'd expect to find a nice place for drinks and dinner situated right by a gas station 2). It's extremely dark in here. Your eyes will take a second to adjust to the dim lighting. It's not a huge place so it can get loud.   Overall I can't wait to get bank to try the food and have a few cocktails.",

I found this place when my boyfriend and I was trying to a good steak place for a decent price. So we found the \"magical happy hour\" (5-8pm) I love how much attention they pay into details from the drink menu that gives you a brief, funny history of the drinks, the drinks selection, the bartenders will customize your drinks too if you ask them, they'll tell you \"whatever you want, I can make that happen\", how good the drinks are, and of course the food never fails.  I did a little fun survey a while ago. Every time I went to a bar I ask the bartender, \"where's your favorite bar?\" and 9/10 they say \"Herbs & Rye\" I talk about this place to everyone I know in Vegas and they all love it.   So it's a Must Try place, whether you want some decent price and quality steak, or a drinks or two or more, or just a very nice bar to talk with your friends or even the bartender if you're by yourself.   I would give this place 10 stars give I could!",

They were booked up with reservations until 8:30pm the Thursday evening we wanted to go, so we showed up as walk-ins at 6pm, and were seated within 10 minutes.  This happy hour is killer - half priced filet mignon meant four of us could eat rich for $100. Our server was wonderful, and great at recommending drinks. I got the Brown Derby, which was the right amount of strong and sweet.  The sides were all excellent - we got four different ones so we could share: truffle mac and cheese, truffle and parmesan steak fries, garlic mashed potatoes, and some kind of whiskey potatoes.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

The Double Bone In Pork Chop, flatbread pizza the jalapeno corn was bomb!  We can't wait to go back!!     Now, the reason we truly went to Herbs and Rye for was them DRANKS!! My girl is in a Union Bartending school and I thought a good way to help her retain the ingredients of the drinks she has been studying is by drinking them!! 90% of the drinks in their large drink menu are in her study guide, so we had a lot drinking to do lol! The drinks were made to perfection which firmly confirmed how good this place is from top to bottom!! Major thumbs up!!",

It's spicy, but by far the best I've ever had. Music was cool, like a 40's feel with a twist.  Its about a 20-25 min drive off the strip (we came from MGM), but definitely worth the drive.",

Just about everything is terrific.   3. The bar is awesome.   They make a mean drink with quality high end liquor.  The prices aren't too bad even for Vegas.    4. The service was spectacular.    5. Parking can be a bit tight.   6. The girls at the check-in are a bit stuck up, and cold.  7.  The pace is very dark inside.  This is the ambiance.  I liked it.    8. Located a bit off the strip.   Cab ride will run you a bit.    Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "My little brother was studying to become a bartender and this was top on his list of places in the city to try. Personally, I've had it on my list since moving out here but, to no one's surprise, it's difficult to get a last minute reservation. You can expect to wait a good while even if you're just seeking a spot at the bar...especially during both their Happy Hours (and for 50% of steaks, why would you come any other time?)   First of all, the parking is a little hairy. You can really only enter the lot from one direction and it's definitely a tight squeeze to get in (and out) of some of the spots. It's also a tight squeeze if you're playing your odds and waiting for a table to open up at the bar. Then again, the design is akin to that of a 1920s Speakeasy so, what do you expect?  Luckily for us, my brother and I were able to snag two seats at the bar with 90 whole Reverse Happy Hour minutes left.   To be honest, the drink menu is at least 2 times as big as the food menu and was a bit overwhelming at first. That said, it is delightfully laid out by time era and each drink features a brief sentence outling its history and importance - which I personally found quite fun to read. Although I cannot recall exactly what I ordered, I know that both of our drinks were AWESOME and once Happy Hour ended and the bar slowed down, my brother and I loved chatting with the bartenders about the restaurant and its menu. Sitting at the bar was also great for watch how these intricate drinks were crafted.   Unfortunately, the steak proved to be a bit of a disappointment. My brother and I both ordered the NY Strip - Rare and Med Rare. When we cut into our selections, it appeared as though we were improperly served (not a big deal) the bigger deal was that it was just hard to tell. When I actually began to eat my steak, it was tough and bland. For a place with Herbs in the title, I sadly tasted very little of anything at all.  Do they use a lower cut of meat for their Happy Hour? Maybe. My brother's cut looked nicer than mine so, maybe not. Would I come back here and try again? Yes. The drinks were great and my overall experience was so overwhelmingly positive that I'm willing to give the meat another chance just on good faith. Also, if you're offered bread, take it! It's complimentary with your meal and it's real good.   Best advice? If you want a table, you're gonna have to plan ahead a least a couple days to make a reservation. But, if you want a more casual/interactive and visual experience, I can't recommend sitting up at the bar enough!",

However, from start to finish the service was just plain bad: I called them the previous day and when I showed up they didn't have my reservation. We sat at the bar until a table opened up and all three bartenders treated us like we didn't exist. By the time we got our drinks, our table had opened up.   The service at the table was a bit better but overall underwhelming.   As for the food, the steaks (filet mignon and flat iron) were decent, nothing spectacular, but when your evening gets off to such a bad start it's kinda hard to enjoy. Would not go back.",

Over all our server was fantastic, I didn't catch her name and I wish I did (if your reading this it was the party of 13 against the back wall). She was helpful, informative, prompt and even brought me the cutest doughnut dessert for my birthday. I would go back as my steak was fantastic. The bacon I could go either way, I like mine more chewy but that was my fault for not ordering it that way. I also recommend the tomato soup with grilled cheese and the steak fries with garlic!",

    "text": "When I walked into to Herbs and Rye, it was almost pitch black. It took a minute for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. I was greeted by the hostess and walked over to the bar. I looked around and immediately was reminded of Fangtasia from True Blood.  There's an old school vibe with the brick walls, red and black wallpaper, chandeliers. and private dark leather booths. The background music was modern and made me feel like I was a vamp tramp. (Yeah, I'm a dork.) I know the theme is prohibition but I couldn't help but think of Fangtasia. Needless to say, I really dug the vibe and decor.  My friends and I came for happy hour. I was a little disappointed that cocktails weren't on the happy hour menu as I read about how well crafted and delicious they are. I was on a budget so I settled on a draft beer which was like $4-5 (I can't recall).   The best part about happy hour is the food. Unlike other restaurants where you get small bites off of the appetizer menu, here you get 50% off hefty entrees. I ordered a Kansas City Steak Strip with Truffle Mac and Cheese for $15! My husband got the Flat Iron Steak with Jalapeno Cream Corn. We all ordered different items off of the happy hour food menu and everything tasted like it was fine dining.   When our waiter mentioned their homemade donuts, we were sold. The donuts came with two types of dipping sauce but I preferred to eat them plain. They were so fresh and fluffy and definitely worth saving room for.  Service was wonderful. We never had an empty glass. Our waiter was friendly and answered all of our questions.   I would definitely come back again to try the cocktails and to have another perfectly cooked steak with the mouth watering truffle mac and cheese. Maybe next time I'll sit at the bar and try to look dark and mysterious to match the vibe of this place.",

At times, it almost seems like a school for young up-and-coming cocktail artists, marshaled by the seasoned head bartender.  The cocktail menu is refreshing in its focus on classic and prohibition era cocktails, but if you are in the mood for something more modern or unique, the bartender will mix you up something fancy and catering to your specific tastes.  The atmosphere is very calm and cozy, a great place to relax after dinner or to recover from a taxing experience in a more 'energetic' bar.  The music I can't quite remember, but I'd like to say it was Jazz.  All I do remember is that it was great background music for a conversation.  I hope the word spreads more for this spot, they deserve a place in the Las Vegas local's scene.",

    "text": "Herbs and Rye is a fitting name for this modernized Speak-Easy cum Steakhouse cum Spaghetti Shop.  I LOVE this place and, though they may not be as \"proprietary\" as Downtown Cocktail Lounge or as \"niche\" as Frankie's Tiki, Herbs and Rye defeats others because, not only do they have Food and Classic Cocktails, they do both exceptionally.  A close friend and I have been frequenting them since last year and, each time we go, we're satisfied with the experience.  First, because it's not the thing you expect from a cocktail room, let's talk food.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Bistecca Flatbread.  I like the steaks (And, at either Happy Hour they are a steal at half-price!) and several of the pasta and Italian dishes, but the Flatbreads are the gold here.  The Bistecca is a well-balanced combo of crisp, fired, cracker-like flatbread topped with a perfect balance of cheese and steak, all topped with a mound of peppery, salty Arugula.  This is great accompaniment to any cocktail.  Also, I found the Pasta Carbonara (They don't call it this, but peas, bacon/ham and cream on pasta is Carbonara.) to be excellent - I've ordered it twice.  I will say it is incredibly rich, so be prepared for it.  Also, don't let it sit too long because it loses its pop if it cools too much.  Now, the coctails are definitely \"where it's at\" at Herbs and Rye.  After my first evening finding this place - desperate for a real cocktail, not beer, wine, or Frat Party Specials - my friend and I sampled about 10 of the cocktails between us.  With the exception of ones we just didn't like from preference, all were great!  Here's my deal, if you can make me a Blood & Sand that is coherent, I'm pretty satisfied.  If the Sazerac tastes good, I'm home.  Both met my test.  For something easily approachable, try the Aviation.  For something with a punch, the Corpse Reviver #2 will do the trick.  The one thing I would like to see is more consistency in the service.  The staff is all very friendly and helpful and knowledgeable, but the one time I've held a party there, they seemed a bit \"run around\".  Also, I rarely see more than one bartender, which is not enough for busier hours, especially during a happy hour.  A note about the Happy Hour, it's one of the few in town to offer items from all parts of the menu - with the exception of the Classic Cocktails - and one of the only ones that runs until 8pm, and then picks-up again at Midnight.  You can start and end you evening here easily.  Bottom Line:  If you want good food, atmosphere and OUTSTANDING cocktails, go to Herbs & Rye.",

Unfortunately, I didnt experience the wheel of a deal during happy hour, but I didn't regret even one sip paying full price!  Open up the menu and you will find a brief description on the origin or a fun fact of each cocktail.  From the Sazarac to the Moscow Mule chilled and served in its original copper mug, each one is worth giving a try.  The Bartenders take their trade seriously here which makes for a very artful show on its own!",

We were greeted by the friendly and no nonsense mixologists, Emily and Mark. We both felt welcomed when they shook our hands and asked our names when we sat down at the bar. The menu was set up by cocktail eras which we found helpful and fun to read. Overall the experience was fantastic. Both mixologists did their work exceptionally well and we loved our drinks. My Lions Tail was spiced appropriately and refreshing at the same time. A great atmosphere ensures all patrons will enjoy their food and drinks here. Go here!",

It has a very 1920's feel with the bartenders' and servers dressed old school and the decor and lighting speakeasy-ish.  I personally love this vibe and often wonder how a city like Las Vegas has such few places that carry this in comparison to the old school steakhouses and restaurants that built this town with that flair.    Overall, the service was outstanding, with the exception of them being severely understaffed.  The bar shook, squeezed, and stirred cocktail after cocktail until everyone seated and standing were satisfied.  The flatbread they brought out was tasty and all I can say is I cannot wait for my return visit.",

Even the menu is artistically designed, categorized by era and a description of the drink and its origins on every cocktail. I came on A Saturday night and sat at the bar, and the service was exemplary. I had a glass of water on the side with my cocktail and it was not only refilled, but when the ice melted it was replenished. I listed five stars for food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. Pricing is high, but well worth it!",

I've lived and Las Vegas my entire life and I feel like I've been living a lie not knowing that such a fantastic place to hang out and grab a drink with friends was in such close reach! The old school decor with the jazzy music selection and dark lit environment really brings an intimate feel. The drink selection is amazingly elaborate, I felt it necessary to order at least three different drinks from different eras. The flat breads blew my mind, and our waiter brought to my attention that happy hour is from 5-8 which includes many of their steaks at half price (average steak price seemed to be around $40)!!                 So happy to discover this place, If you decide to give it a try Id recommend dressing up a little just to bring the experience over the top (casual clothes work too, but once you step inside you'll see what I mean). Order drinks from different eras, and don't forget to bring good company :)",

I love that Herbs & Rye's cocktail menu spans over a century of different libations; where else can you get a mini history lesson while deciding on what to drink?

Their happy hour menu is not limited to steaks but also sides and by the glass wines. Being a popular spot, if you go with a big group expect a wait. Midnight hits and this place is packed. Who would of thought so many carnivores craved meats this late. I ordered my favorite cut, Ribeye medium rare closer to rare. I like it juicer than most. It was cooked a little more medium but still very tasty. I also ordered two sides: asparagus and their truffle mashed potatoes. The asparagus were perfect, steamed with still a bite to it. The truffle oil mash was a little too buttery for my taste. It was very wet and mushy. Overall, this place is great for late night eats. For a fine dining establishment. I really hope their food is better during normal hours.",

    "text": "Herbs and Rye has been one of those Vegas staples that I've felt too bashful to step into. I thought the cocktails that they're known for would cost an arm and a leg. Their happy hour deal on steaks finally reeled me in.  I had a wonderful time with a group of five friends. The decor was cool. A lot of wood panels and low lighting. We had an awesome server. Her name was Ally I believe. She gave us recommendations on cocktails and food. She was spot on with the recommendations after we let her know which liquors we like.  My drink was delicious. I wish I could remember what it was but I don't. I know it had egg whites though. After one drink I was feeling a nice buzz. I didn't even taste the alcohol & the drink was delicious.  So during happy hour they have half off steaks that include one side. I got the New York strip with a side of truffle mac and cheese. My steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. It was tender, moist, and succulent. I believe it was 16oz and came out to $18 during happy hour.   During happy hour they also have $5 well drinks. I did opt for a rum and coke. It was a non-spiced rum and I thought the drink was delicious.  I was so scared to come in here for no reason! I found out their cocktails are all $11-$12 dollars. These are craft cocktails that's are expertly mixed.   I just had a great time and that really tied the visit up for me. I had a great drink to start the night, an inexpensive well drink to keep it going, and finished it off with some delicious food. It was a great experience with a light price tag.  I can't wait to go back and try all of their cocktails.",

When we first pulled up we were the first in the parking lot, but wow how quickly it filled up while us and others trotted in for our tables.  Bar was full in about 30 minutes of opening at 5pm.  Other tables were available, however I still recommend reservations.  Our server Christian was AMAZING!  Professional, great sense of humor, but most importantly knowledgable about the history of the restuarant and the menu.  He truly added to our positive experience.  Atmosphere was dark, old school, but cool.  Loved how different it was from the flashy bright neon lights of Vegas.  FYI limited parking we were lucky since our reservation was right when they opened, but leaving two hours later many cars were waiting for our spot. Now on to the food...  Spicy Mussels -- 5 stars and best part is that they are on happy hour.  Sauce with delicious, loved dipping my bread in the sauce to soak up the juice!  yummy  Filet Mignon -- perfectly cooked rare as requested, great flavor, no seasoning needed, large portion size 9 oz.  On happy hour list as well.  New York Strip -- again cooked as requested, large portion size 14 oz, great flavor.  On happy hour list.  Sides included with steaks: Broccoli and Sharp cheddar -- very cheesy, which I love, broccoli perfected cooked not to soft or too hard.  Definitely wanted more!  Truffle Mac and Cheese -- white truffle, rich in flavor.  Definitely would get again.  Dessert: Donuts -- LOVE LOVE LOVE, fresh, light fluffy with light coating of sugar.  Love the ability to drown them in the dipping sauces of white chocolate and carmel.  OMG heaven!  Drinks: French 75 -- as a champagne lover, I enjoyed this.  I would get again, however may try something new first.  Clover Club -- my husband got this, but I wanted to steal it!  Wow!  I will be getting this next time!  Smooth...easy on the palette with great flavor.  Happy Hour Wine: Pinot grigio -- good wine, big pour. Cab -- surprisingly smooth and lighter than expected, big pour. Both would get again.  The happy hour prices are surprising.  50% off our food items!  It was good enough to get at full price, but I would rather go during happy hour times and get more!  LOL It was a great saturday night dinner experience, we will definitely be back, recommend to others and will bring others.  I strongly suggesting give this place a try.",

    "text": "Abundant grilled meats, a bonanza of specialty cocktails.  Very few beers.  I like this place, overall, but the hostesses are definitely the weak point from my experience.  Made a reservation three weeks prior for a large party to celebrate a friend's retirement.  When we arrived, we stood at the podium unacknowledged while three employees carried on a work conversation for almost a minute. While I know a business requires employee communication, it would have been appropriate to say \"Hi, I'll be with you in a moment.\"    Considering our reservation was 6pm, most of the dining room was empty, but the bar was packed three deep. The hostess never made arrangements for our group table to be assembled and forced ten of us to stand in the narrow hallway, until the full party arrived. In my opinion, they should have seated us at our table and taken drink orders, if for nothing more than the convenience of their staff and other guests.  Finally, at about 6:15 after I pressed the point, the hostess spoke to some staff and led us to be seated... at two tables of six. Two tables? What? No. That's not what a group reservation means. Then as we stood watching, in the way again, the staff arranged one long table. Finally, we were seated. Things went much better from there.  Our server was pleasant and worked both ends of the table to ensure everyone knew about their 5-8pm food and beverage happy hour.  It took a long time to get our food, but it came out close to together and was relatively tasty. The available time was consumed along with conversation and cocktails. We were a happy bunch. I had the NY Strip, a well-portioned steak with delicious seasoning and cooked to perfection.  Above all, I want to recognize our assistant server, Andre. He was always on top of things.  Bread, water, removing spent glassware, even taking orders for fresh drinks.  Honestly, if it wasn't for Andre, this would be a three-star review.  The kitchen puts out good food.  The servers and assistants were good.  The establishment needs to empower the hostesses to be problem-solvers instead of rule-followers.  Lastly, for  those who enjoy beer, a broader selection would be appreciated, even if it's bottled.  Nice joint.  I'll visit again, but not with more than five friends.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now. The first time, the concierge at the Cosmopolitan recommended it. The second time, I brought a group of 12. Michelle, the reservations agent, was awesome and made sure our party was accommodated.   Each time, I ordered the filet, which was perfect. I ordered a wedge salad each time, which was also very good. They offer a side with each steak, so I recommend the brussels sprouts.   The decor is old rat pack style, but is a newer remodel. The waiting area is crowded, so the bar is the place to be while you wait. The bartenders are attentive, and the bar has a locals feel, without feeling like you're an outsider.   Each time, our waiter was friendly, without being annoying and both were very knowledgeable about steaks and the wine selection. I wished I had ordered a dessert, but didn't have room. Highly recommended   Oh, p.s., if you had patience to read this far, you are well rewarded...steaks are half price during happy hour!",

    "text": "Great reverse happy hour! An amazing local spot!!! It's a speak easy, vintage ambiance. Craft cocktails with a very descriptive menu so that you can try new things and know the era in which it is from. My go to drink is the brandy cresta (if I'm spelling that correctly, lol). It's forward on the citrus side with sugar on the rim! I also had A brandy Alexander which is more in the creamy, after dinner side. Both were great and out of my normal bubble.   Now let's get to steak!!!! They are known for their steaks!!!!! They are half off on happy hour. I hadn't been here Ina few months, I noticed they raised their prices, but still reasonable for happy hour. I ordered the NY strip with truffle Mac and cheese and added a onion and mushroom topper to my steak! I am a fan but of the topper option! With every slice I'm getting my toppings!   If you're looking for an experience, try and grab a seat at the bar! The mixologist are fun, captivating and very interacting! They might even take a drink with you!",

    "text": "Why does the filet mignon taste like carne asada?   So upset that my meal wasn't as delicious as usual, actually so upset I probably won't be coming back for a long while. My boyfriend and I would always come to Herbs n Rye for our steak and potato fix. Usually, it would always hit the spot, but not this time. It seems like its under new management (not a good thing). I have a few things to complain about, I suppose, and I hardly ever complain about my experiences with food. This is actually my first yelp review.   I'm pretty damn sure they raised their prices on a few food items. The filet mignon happened to be one of them. That's my usual with a few sides. The sides were up to par with my past experiences, but the filet mignon is the reason for this review. It used to be $34 for it (not happy hour) and now it's $10 more! The worst part about this is the fact that my filet tasted nothing like a filet mignon! If anything, it tasted like carne asada. The meat wasn't cooked medium well (what I ordered), it was completely well-done. I don't know what the hell is up with this \"butterfly cook method\" but no. Never again. The meat was not tender at all, usually it \"melts\" in my mouth, and it wasn't thick or rounded like how a filet mignon is supposed to look. Maybe it wasn't even a filet mignon, even though the bill said it was. Also, not impressed with the service or that techno/electronic music shit like every other restaurant in Vegas. I'm going to miss that classy vibe from Herbs n Rye:(",

The spicy muscles are quite good, just be sure to ask for more bread at the beginning.  We've had both the filet and the strip steak.  Both were excellent and I am a little picky about steaks.  The sweet potato tater tots are a can't miss side item.  Finally, the cookie desert (huge) and the espresso were top-notch.    Don't let the exterior of the building fool you.   This place is a rock solid choice if you want to go somewhere that doesn't involve the casinos.  And the happy hour 50% off specials are unbeatable.",

It took around 20 minutes for the server to take my order. And it took ONE AND HALF HOUR to get my steak. At least if my steak is juicy and tender then I can tolerate. But... the steak is like a cheap steak from your local grocery store. So chewy, I can't even swallow it, no juice at all. My friend also order a steak, same thing chewy like a rubber... especially $35 for two steak, so so so disappointed...   Maybe it was only me, on the bad day at the wrong chef. But that experience will never ever bring me back to Herbs and Rye.",

Their drink menu is a big plus, but while they are priced around standard 8-9 dollars per cocktail, they are on the smaller side.

They also have a happy hour on their own beer, which is delicious and you can't beat it for $3. I always treat myself to a few of their craft cocktails as well, of course I wish they were also happy hour, but I don't mind paying for a yummy Moscow Mule, and they are strong too! Not to mention, the great atmosphere, I always feel like I've gone back in time as soon as I walk in the door, from the decor to the gatsby-esque music, to the lighting, to the cocktails, to the black and white movies, and even the bartender's uniforms.

    "text": "Apparently there are two Herbs and Rye - the one that people seem to love here on yelp, and the one I went to, which sucked.  Strangely enough, they are in the same building, so good luck getting the good one if you go there.  Everything from the ambiance to the service to the quality of the drinks was poor the night we went there.  Supposedly that is not the typical experience; so I may try it out again....  Problem 1: the bar booth tables have no leg space, so 4 of us were uncomfortable in a booth that appeared to be quite large.  Problem 2: the service was terrible.  The waiter took our drink order, and came back 15 minutes later to take a second drink order for our friends.  I inquired about where our drinks were and he then realized he never put in our drink order.  When we finally got drinks (25 minutes after ordering in a very empty bar), he spilled half of my friend's drink and one of the other drinks was only about 2/3 full.  (He did not offer to bring her a new one.)  Problem 3: The drinks did not taste very good.  They were OK, but not the awesome deliciousness that I was expecting.  Also, there are no prices on the drink menu, and there are wild rumors flying about town that drinks cost $20-30 each.  (They do not, they were all $9, which was the only reason I was not totally angry).  I've had similar cocktails at other mixology establishments that were much better... just more balanced.  These all seemed to have one taste (bitter, sweet) that overwhelmed the rest of the drink, which I think should be a more subtle combination of flavors that enhance one another, not clash for dominance.  Problem 4: The place has a lot of potential ambiance, but at some point they just cranked up the top 40 radio, which is not very \"speakeasy.\"  The only food we ordered was the (vegan! yay!) sweet potato tots.  I really liked these, and that's why this place is getting two stars instead of one.  That and b/c the drinks were only $9.",

    "text": "The story you are about to read is True. This is old town, classic Las Vegas, Nevada. My name is Skacey, I carry twenty years of memories about the town the mob built.  This investigation starts at Kahunaville inside the TI. I ask the bottle slinger behind the bar about classic cocktails. My never ending quest for the perfect Sezarac leads the conversation to Herbs & Rye. According to his story, H&R is the place to find it.  8:23 pm. My partner and I are on east Sahara when we spot what appears to be a classic Vegas dive bar. Industrial plain building leads me to believe the trail may dead end here. Stepping through the door and we are greeted by a remarkably warm and inviting interior. We decide to sit at the bar to get the full experience.  Now I've spent more than my fair share in Vegas bars and eateries. I remember the Vegas of the 80's as the last whimpers of organized crime faded behind corporate greed. Herbs and Rye brings a classic, personal touch to service. Our bartender is a consummate professional with enough personal interaction to make you feel more than welcome. I would trade ten modern servers for one who studies the art of service like this gentleman.  The True test comes when I tentatively ask for a Sezarac, fully expecting to have to explain what it is and what's in it. Without missing a beat, the bartender asks about my preference on Rye Whiskey. I just about giggled with delight (yep, glance back at that profile picture and visualize giggling - quite a shocker, huh?)  The drink is exquisite.  For the food, I tried their Seafood Diablo and found it to also be inspired. Not to short the details on the food, but remember, I giggled through much of my meal.  The Good: Best Classic Cocktails, and Classic Service in Las Vegas The Bad: Why does it have to be so far from my home town, Orlando, FL? The Ugly: The outside of the building - really let it go, once you're inside, you'll forget all about it.",

After midnight they have the Happy Hour which is 50% off select items on your menu.  I tried the gnocchi the first time I ate there and fell in love.  I know where to get my late night italian fix now when i'm craving it.  I also had the rib eye steak which was Delicious and cooked perfectly.  Not to mention it was one of the 50% off happy hour items.  I always get the sweet potato tator tots everytime i'm there.  The well drinks are also half off during happy hour.  If you want to try something different get the Russian Mule.  Its a citrus tasting drink with vodka and ginger beer served in a brass mug with crushed ice.  I tried one for the first time and it instantly became a favorite.      Check this place out if you are on that side of town which is central Las Vegas, not too far from the strip.  Happy Hour specials are awesome.  Food is great.  Drinks are great.  And the history about place is kind of cool also, knowing that it used to be an old Mob/Gangster hang out back in the day.",

Such as atmosphere, customer service, value, wait time, everything. It's not even something to think about to not give them a perfect rating. To be honest the first and second time I went here I thought it was beginners luck beings this place is a bit of the grid. I can assure you it's not. I go once a week and it's as good every time. The steaks are amazing, the sides are the best mac and cheese and mashed potatoes I've ever had. The fact they even have happy hour and half off steaks and certain cocktails is so awesome. And also the cocktails. Well all the bartenders there are True bartenders making amazing cocktails from all periods of time. They also just got rated best cocktail lounge in Las Vegas. Emily is an amazing bartender with skills and personality. I truly love this restaurant. Always best to call ahead and reserve a table if you have a few heads with you. They will always try to accommodate. Everyone there is smiling and enjoying having customers there right down to the bus boys. Thanks Herbs and Rye for being awesome. See you next week!!!",

First 3-4 times I came here was perfectly happy... but then the patron to my right ordered food, life had changed. Steak happy hour I discover is between 4-8 and 12-4am you will be more then satisfied 50% off steaks that you would be happy to pay 200% for. Between the steaks, the calamari, the chorizo meatballs... this place is a gem! Doesn't look much from the outside but crack the door have a seat enjoy a \"everybody knows my name\" top knotch experience. Granted even with the happy hour steaks a 2 hour visit normally rings in about $130 with all the drinks you won't be able to resist, I pay it with a smile and shake the bartenders hand with a gracious tip of the hat. Favorite place for dinner in Vegas hands down. *Pro Tip* Rebel Republic is right across the street one of the best craft beer spots in LV pay them a visit first to wet the whistle, great beers friendly staff, tell Wendy I sent ya ;).",

Be warned that the drinks are handcrafted so they take a while to get to the table. We all ordered steaks because of the 50% off prices during happy hour (5-7.) There was nothing fancy about them. They were cooked right and had an excellent seasoned taste. The truffle Mac and cheese side dish was incredible. Save room for dessert. The donuts melt in your mouth.  By the time we left at 8pm, the place was packed, mostly with locals. It was a $20 cab ride from the strip, but was well worth the trip.",

I have to say though, I had some sticker shock. $17 for a small/medium-ish plate of plain fettuccine alfredo?! Really?! And Matt said it ended up being $19 because they made a mistake on the bill and he didn't want to contest it -.-  It was decent, but the cream sauce better have been milked from virgin unicorns because there is no way it was worth that much. I can get a giant plate of the best fettuccine alfredo in town for $14 at Casa Di Amore. This place, even though the ambiance was lovely and the service was spectacular, the food was no Casa Di Amore.  Matt ordered the red, green, and white pizza. This thing was as big as the menu and $10 - not bad. It tasted okay, but I'm not a huge ricotta cheese fan so it lost me there, but overall it was flavorful.  The service was amazing, the surroundings were lovely, but the food was not up to par. It tasted fine, but once the bill rolled around - yikes. I would probably come back during happy hour but that's about it.",

We had the calamari as an appetizer and a few drinks which were all very good. My husband orders prime rib with the truffle mac and cheese and I had the New York steak with the mac and cheese they were both very good and the steaks were at the perfect temperature. This was our second time there and we will definitely be going back. Mark Vega was our server and he was so attentive to every detail he made us feel right at home and so did everybody else who helped us. Can't wait to go back",

    "text": "Without the help of yelp I probably wouldn't consider this place just by looking from the outside.  Mainly because it just looks like a bar.  Walking in looks cozy burgundy wallpaper, brick, and dim lighting. We were first asked if we are over 21 years old. We were sat at a booth alongside the bar.  Candle centerpiece.  Black napkin wrapped utensils on side plates.  Large steakhouse style menu. An old western in black and white playing on the tv. The server had pretty hair and makeup styled that went with the theme.  Merlot for me, Napa Pinot noir for him.  Although we didn't order cocktails, I appreciated the art in the bartenders craft. Working in nightlife I am so accustomed to the quick pour of drinks. This was a nice change of pace. His napkin didn't appear like it was washed thoroughly.  The server quickly replaced it. She suggested the beef carpaccio and penne.  So we chose the carpaccio over the clams we had originally picked out.  He ordered rib eye with spinach on the side.  The carpaccio came out quickly. Arugula tossed with truffle oil atop the meat, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and capers. Very fresh and delicious. Large serving but not filling when shared between the two of us. The steak!  Mmm the steak...  Ribeye. Nicely seasoned. Cooked to perfection.  Juicy and tender. I love fat, so ribeye is one of my favorite cuts.  This place did it justice. My bf of course asked for A1. It was served in a sauce cup. The spinach side was a bit small so we ordered the little neck clams. When they arrived the server spilled the sauce on the table and my boyfriends hand.  Probably because the plate was hot. She apologized but did not wipe it up and picked up some empty plates instead.  The clams were nice and small the sauce a little creamy and you can taste the herbs. The bread it came with for dipping was nice and sour, soft in the middle. My boyfriend waited a while for a refill on his wine.  Another server ended up coming by and asked if he needed another. A few moments later our server came to check up.  My bf asked for extra napkins to clean the spill from earlier and that was when she wiped it up. By then our clams were done. Shortly after his wine arrived from the other server.  Minutes after we were informed it was now happy hour.  (Clams and wine are happy hour) Unfortunately, we waited to get them minutes before happy hour started.  The desserts were offered verbally. Baked cookie topped with ice cream or sugar donuts. The photos on yelp led is to donuts. Ohh my... 10 mini donuts with donut holes.  Soft and warm with the crunch of sugar. Caramel and white chocolate for dipping. We ate every bite of our meal but 2 clams.  No to go box? Rare occasion for us. The food alone would have gotten 5 stars from me.  The bill came out to $158 before tip.  Really excited that this is a late night spot.",

Garlic mashed potatoes, jalapeno creamed corn and brussel sprouts were all bomb! I asked for a1 sauce and didnt even need to use it. We will definitely be back- nice ambience and prohibition feel to it... Next time ill try the drinks since this time we didnt wanna get wastey pants and actually enjoy our dinner since we were on vacation. Great food, great price ( $90 for 3 of us) , great service- viva herbs & rye!",

    "text": "First impression of showing up at Herbs and Rye were not the greatest.   From trying to find a parking place to walking into a dark, dark restaurant and having to wait for the hostess to return to the stand and not be greeted right away or even looked at. Almost some what completely ignored for several minutes while she was playing with some menus, looking at the computer and whatever else.  But after we were seated our server was awesome and helpful, he explained the specials and since we were there during happy hour the steaks were 1/2 off and they came with 1 side. So, the steaks weren't horrible just way too chard on the outside and incredibly pink on the inside. 3 of the steaks were ordered medium well, however they were more like chard medium. However, The pork chop with figs was incredible.  As for the sides, the mac n cheese, truffle fries and broccoli and cheese were all really good.  For dessert, the donuts were good,  however, the Creme brulee wasn't good at all. It wasn't creamy and the topping was too thick.  Also, the menu says that for parties over 6, gratuity is included. However, it is calculated on the regular price menu, not the happy hour menu. Kind of suspect, especially since happy hours are 5-8 and midnight to 3am. I think that is kind of wrong and our waiter didn't tell us that the gratuity was included as well.  In conclusion, I'm not so sure that we will be back, especially with so many exceptional restaurants in town with easy parking, amazing customer service, ambience, and great food for the \"happy hour pricing\" which in other restaurants would be normal pricing.",

    "text": "So I've been hearing about this place for a while for fellow Yelpers and been wanting to try. When I finally got the chance, we ended up having plans to go twice in the same week! If my rating was based solely on service they would've got a 1.5, based on drinks 4.5, based on food 3. My first time there we were with a very large group ( 30+ people) on a Tuesday night at 8pm. It's not like they didn't know we were coming, but they seemed overwhelmed. They couldn't keep up with our drink orders, it took way too long to get the orders in let alone get the drink (even if it was just bourbon on the rocks). It took a long time to get our food as well, some people in our group were done and leaving when we didn't even get our food yet. They ran out of sides. Brought out sides way before our entree so the side was cold. Steaks were overdone. My lobster tail was over cooked. The food was just  \"meh\". We were all happy with the drink selection and drinks...when we got them. I was turned off with that first try, but I gave them a pass since it was such a large group. And went back with some friends on Friday night around 7:30. Again, service was horrible. It took forever to get our drink orders, and it was nearly impossible to get the waiters attention if you wanted anything else. Once we ordered food, the food also took forever. I got the Calamari this time and the first time and it was good both times. I also got a Prosciutto and Asparagus Flatbread, it was good, nothing exciting, but good. My husbands steak was much better this time and his side, Broccoli and Cheese was yummy. A friend at our table never got his food when we were all done eating, so he cancelled his order. My drinks were perfect (order 2 drinks at a time because they take so long to get!) Brown Derby and Blinker, both good in their own way. It was our friends birthday so we all split some Donuts....they were awesome. I like the decor and old fashioned vibe. I've been to this locale before it was Herbs And Rye...boy has it changed!  The service alone would keep me from going back, not sure if I will go back. Only time will tell. Good thing they have some loyal Yelpers as patrons because they turned off a room full of people.",

Atmosphere was a bit dark inside, but the place was packed. We had to wait a bit for our dinner table, so we had a cocktail at the bar. Joe the bartender made my wife's favorite cocktail drink and actually made it better than other places. Joe was attentive and personable. We were seated about 15minutes earlier than our reservation time. Debra our waitress was fabulous. Cheerful and professional at the same time. She gave us great recommendations. Must have their RIBEYE along with the mac cheese truffle as your side. The char, flavor, & the way we like our ribeye, med -rare was on point! The clam appetizer was so flavorful, just a bit over cooked though. If this was cooked perfectly  then we would have rated this place a 5star. Also had button mushrooms as a side & it was perfect. All the dishes we ordered did not need any additional seasoning to our tastebuds. Brandon, the sever's assistant was polite, friendly, & very attentive to out table. Even the manager, Valeria stopped by to say hi and asked if dinner was going well. The fresh doughnut dessert was warm, lite, and delicious. Oh, don't forget to have a glass of red wine with your steak.  5p-8p is Happy Hour. So the Ribeye was 1/2 off. Dinner for 2 including tip just under $100. We shared the 18oz. steak and we were full & content. Definitely will return and also bring family & friends when they visit us.",

Cooked to perfection, and the bacon and blue cheese were just the right touch. Happy hour is amazing here, it's half off steaks! How can you beat that!? The well drinks are also only $5.00 during happy hour, and they have a bottle of red, and a bottle of white that are half off as well.   The only complaint that I would have is that the service is a teeny bit slow. My husband ordered a beer which the server forgot to bring, and when he finally remembered my husband was half way through his meal and decided not to have it any more. I don't fully blame the server since I feel it was only him and one other person serving tables, and it was busy. Other than the few minor mishaps, all was well! I will definitely be returning!",

The server was good, not great. We got told it would be a 25 minute wait, but it was definitely less time than that, however a group that came in after us got seated before us. So they lose a star for that.  The environment is very nice, in an old fashioned kind of way. It was pretty wild for a Tuesday night which I thought was odd.  The three ladies had a whiskey and ginger ale, the bartender was very friendly and I enjoyed his helpfulness. He was quick, friendly, checked up on us while we waited for our table and overall gave great customer service. Later in the evening I ordered an aviation. If you haven't had one before try it, it takes a bit to get used to but it was delicious none the less. Will definitely be back again!",

The atmosphere was great everyone seemed happy and lively I know a lot of industry people come here!   I will totally be coming back to check out some more of this menu and great drinks :) maybe I'll make a reservation next time lol",

    "text": "SHH! This is a local hideout from the Strip. Keep those pesky tourists away! On a serious note, this is where locals get great steaks for very cheap (HALF OFF!) and a perfectly curated encyclopedia of classic and modern cocktails. Their steaks have great seasoning, but to unlock the full flavors from these steaks, don't hesitate to pay the extra for a sauce or seasoning! They also come with a side, which I normally choose the mashed potato or fries. Lastly, I have never been here at a non-Happy Hour time from 4PM-7PM and from 12AM-3AM I believe. Don't be fooled, the late night happy hour DOES get busy, so find a seat and get there earlier if you have to. Service isn't fantastic, but who cares when you've got great food and $5 well drinks!  PS: Get there even earlier for parking, it gets difficult sometimes.",

Fine, we'll go...  We made a reservation and I told the hostess it was his birthday, asking if they do anything special. She stated she would make a note for our server under the reservation -- and depending on the server, they'll either send out a round of shots or their donut dessert with a candle!   Well, the server did wish him happy birthday before we ordered our food... and again as we left. But he didn't receive ANYTHING (which is even more annoying, because two booths down, that guy got a candle lit dessert!). Maybe I just get bad luck when I come to this place, but wow... it took everything in me to not make a scene as we left.   Strike two, Herbs & Rye. ____________________  EDIT: - NOT TO MENTION A VERY SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING & UNAPOLOGETIC BUSINESS OWNER!

The menu was good, with a few choices & good prices. The drink menu was amazing, sectioned off in eras.  Service was great, up until serving. Once our food arrived, we became invisible.  We had to ask for salt & pepper 2x, asked for A1 sauce 3x (sadly the rib eye was flavorless), and the mac & cheese arrived when we were finished (after asking 3x for it). The rib eye was a bit over cooked (per menu), no juicy flavor, & very blah.  The filet was just \"ok\".   The server appeared on it, but forgot everything once asked.   Again, I thought it would be a hidden gem with amazing food, but it wasn't.",

The show stopping bartender is Spotty who somehow manages to mix cocktails like a boss while still taking great care of the people right in front.   During my first visit he and Joe took great care welcoming me as a first time guest. Stopped, shook my hand, asked my name, welcomed me to Vegas. I felt like royalty! I drank the Hemingway Daiquiri which forever changed the way I think about the Daiquiri cocktail. Not overly sweet. Tart. Delicious.   The filet sliders are juicy bites of heaven. You know it's going to be mouth wateringly delicious when they ask what temp you want the meat on your sliders. The bruschetta flatbread was refreshing and delicious. The showstopper was the shrimp cocktail. I want to go back in time and thank that shrimp for its service.   Before I left Joe asked where I was headed. He made a \"boomerang cocktail\" message to take with me to the Velveteen Rabbit bartenders.   I already feel at home at this place. So much so that I went back the following night and enjoyed their HH steak. The New York strip was a steal!! Garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus + all the cocktails makes for a delicious evening.   See you soon because I'm going to boomerang my booty back asap.",

First off, Andres our server was patient and very helpful with the menu and explained the happy hour specials. Four of us all ordered the Ribeye (delicious) and probably worth the regular price. Sides were deceivingly more than it looked. I had the Garlic spinach and my wife had the truffle mac and cheese (both delicious) Typical well drinks half off because of Happy hour (good).  Dessert time was the sugar donuts (delicious). Service did slow down a bit at the end, but the classic vibe was cool! Like I said Andres was a cool cat, and made our overall dining experience cool too. Also thanks to the side help with clearing out tables and bringing out the food out.  Definitely see why people have raved about this place, and having lived in Vegas for 15 years makes me think how we've always missed coming here.  Recommendations all around for this place. Can't wait to try Cleaver!",

It's dark and they play really loud music. We were seated and it took at least 10-15 minutes before someone came to greet us and get our drink order. But by then, we were already ready to order our food (which took extremely long to come out)   I ordered the linguine and clams, it was very good. They're very generous with the amount of clams they give. My boyfriend had the surf n turf, which was AMAZING. We shared a calamari appetizer, that was soso. Not what I was expecting.   Reason I give 3 stars is because our service wasn't that great. I couldn't even make myself leave 20% because it was that terrible. I can't remember our waiter's name, but he hardly came around to check on us and I felt that we were in the restaurant longer than we needed to be. Don't get me wrong, he was nice, but we were in there at 9:30pm and didn't leave til almost 11:30pm.  I would come back for the food, but for the amount of money that we're spending on food; I'd expect the service to be a lot better.",

Parking lot is small and I had to park 2 plazas over and walk 3-4 minutes before entering the restaurant. Outside of the restaurant looks plain and dark, I was wondering why my friends chose this restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is the complete opposite from the outside. Inside you are greeted and served by the nicest receptionist and waiters. The lights are dim with an old fashion decor to the restaurant. The place is always packed with customers too. For food we ordered a filet, meatballs, kitchen sink. Food here is delicious and portions are large enough to share. Overall, food is great but you're looking at spending around $40-60 for dinner. They do have a happy hour which ends at 7pm (forgot when it started). The service here is top notched and I recommend anyone to try this place at least once.",

We sipped on cocktails from the \"Prohibition Era,\" spanning from 1920-1933. This is a late night spot. A perfect place for a late dinner and night cap cocktail. They close at 3 am.

I got the Yardbird and Risotto which was so amazing!!! We also ordered the truffle mac and cheese and whiskey Shallot Potatoes and they were to die for! I also tried the weekend at the wardolf cocktail and it was good! It's more on the sweeter side.

Also - I would highly recommend their creamy horseradish sauce, as I simply could not get enough of it!  This is a popular place, so if  you plan to come during prime hours, get a reservation.  They have two happy hours where you can get certain items half off (highly recommend). It is a small establishment which isn't the most accessible for people in wheelchairs, but the staff were very accommodating and helpful, which made up for it.  The entry is a little rough for those on wheels, however. It is dark and sultry - great for a fancy date where you don't have to dress up if you are on vacation (Jeans and a nice shirt would be okay).",

    "text": "After a dozen visits to Herbs and Rye, I can honestly say it is my favorite place in Las Vegas.  The bar is lively, the bartenders friendly and the crowd (with a few exceptions) is local.  If you want to make friends while enjoying great food and drinks, this is the place.  Steaks and selected drinks are half-price from 5-8p daily.  EAT the ribeye...it is the bomb!  Sprouts/swine, mac/cheese and sweet tots are a few of my favorite sides.    This is a BOOZE bar.  They have a few wines and some beers, but nearly everyone drinks cocktails.  The booze selection is extensive and the bartenders can help you craft any cocktail.  They also have a great list of house cocktails - at least 20.  So if you need assistance, you just choose something from the list.  Finally, a big shout-out to Eddie, Matt, Gene, Mike and the other bartenders who make Herbs and Rye such a great experience!",

    "text": "Last night was our first visit to Herbs & Rye and it was such a great experience. I heard if you go during happy hour most entrees are half price which would have been great but we missed happy hour by about an hour. We were fine with paying full price because the food was spectacular! Order the tomato soup you won't be disappointed and there is a little surprise that comes with it. I won't spoil it for you just do it. The drinks were great the pims cup was my favorite a play on a Moscow mule with cucumber and mint. We also tried the New York strip with a chile sauce on it that was great and the truffle fries I heard the truffle Mac is great too but we were so full we didn't want to over do it. Do yourself another favor and ORDER THE DONUTS! Seriously best donuts in town I was expecting it to be a bowl of donut holes or something. No. They give you ten tiny perfect little actual donuts fried to perfection with two dipping sauces they were so good I would come back just to have those donuts.  Mark was a great server he knew exactly what to recommend and he was very friendly! Will definitely ask for him the next time we go! All in all it was a great experience we will be back very soon thanks Mark you're awesome!",

If you're looking for unique, well-made cocktails then this is a must visit. They have broken down the various drinks by historical time period and the menu provides a little description of how the drink got its name.   Almost everyone took advantage of the happy hour, half price steaks. One of the filets was a bit under-cooked, but for the most part they were spot on. All the sides we ordered were great, but the truffle mac and cheese was a table favorite. I can't say enough about the \"Farmer\" flat bread pizza - bacon, spinach, and a cracked egg. This is something you just have to try in order to understand how delicious it really is.   Dessert was almost certainly out of the question until the server started to describe them. We ordered their version of the pizooki as well as the homemade doughnuts. The entire table thought they had died and gone to heaven after finishing these desserts. Save room!  Another satisfying and enjoyable experience. Great food, solid drinks and a unique atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy Strip.",

    "text": "Came here because we've heard such good things and let me start off by saying the HH menu was shortened tremendously in regards to food. Aside from the half priced steaks, there were only 3 appetizers that were half off. Started off with the chicken wings with Thai sauce, we really liked it. Nice crisp wings and the sauce was good too. We all decided to order some type of steaks, I had the Kansas Steak and my 2 other friends ordered the rib eye. Our sides were truffle fries, truffle mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes. My Kansas Steak was really good and my friends agreed their rib eyes were delicious as well. I had the mashed potatoes, which I really enjoyed too. The food is worth coming back for hands down, however the reason for my 2 star review is because the service was horrible. Our server was Ronnie and he seemed kind of un patient with us. For instance, when we asked him to explain the HH to our friend who came late because it's kind of complicated, he rudely adds \"Not really\" and then explains to her what is included. There was an attitude problem I felt like to the point we were going to walk out.  Whenever we asked him for something we felt like we were walking on egg shells. My friends and I all work in service industries and know what it takes to be rude to a customer and this guys certainly was. I certainly do hope he was just having a bad day because we really enjoyed the food.",

    "text": "I will begin by saying I am bias. I will continue by saying my dining experience was fruitful, I didn't despise this place nor do I now. But the touted \"three-star\" Herbs & Rye has received is solely based on what happened after the restaurant. Maybe I'm just as bitter as the beer I received, not a complaint, or maybe I'm just indifferent cause I have had world class bistec in my time, not a complaint.   I came here on a weekday, I believe it was a Thursday. To get it started, we went during Happy Hour. Happy Hour is from 5-8pm and 12am to some un-Godly hour. It includes the choice steaks, well drinks and beer and some appetizers and such. A fair deal for steaks you usually overpay for in most cases. I came here with a bunch of friends for a nice relaxing, cheaper than usual meal.  I won't complain about much, the service was great and I wasn't misled on any of the items. Usually when you go to a place, the server will try and sway you from the Happy Hour deal for their own benefit. Not here, our waiter pretty much made it seem like we were crazy to choose any of the full priced items. I ordered a Red Amber beer because it was Happy Hour and when I got it, it was a little warm. He did tell me they were changing the keg, but I assumed that it would still be cool. Not in this case, I still drank the darn thing because I have problems, but it wasn't as refreshing as I probably expected.   Speaking on my behalf, I ordered the \"Bone in Kansas City Strip,\" which I added a spice to the steak (it started with a Ch- kind of deal, I can't recall - but it was olive oil, garlic and thyme I want to say). You also get a free side and I splurged and got the truffle mac n' cheese. Overall  the meal was delicious and I was super full after eating. I wish that you didn't have to pay 3 bucks to put the topping on the steak, but I mean when you're paying half price for $30-40 steak it's worth it. My steak did have bone in, but it was oddly peculiar that there was bone also lining the rim of portions of my steak. A tedious process to cut around, but again, steak is steak and a man likes to work and earn his food.   Okay, so I left and proceeded to have a horrible night. I spent more time with the toilet then I did with my girlfriend that night, our date night. My stomach did not feel good and I was miserable after. Maybe it's the mess that is my body or maybe it's the food I ate, but I didn't enjoy the feeling. I haven't ever had food poisoning and I don't think I even had it at all, but the feeling after the meal I had wasn't normal. That being said, it may be a little bit till I go back because I may have to get bowel reconstruction (a joke -__- ). I don't blame on it on the place, but I just have to say I didn't feel like that until after the food. So, I applaud the efforts of the Herbs and Rye staff and I will be back. But when my bowel is ready for another round. Otherwise, people should come here for some decently priced food and drinks!",

I order the Pork and fig, it was super delicious, but I, as a cook myself, have never cooked a pork as rare as I had it. I couldn't really tell because the lighting was really dark, but the next I'm completely sick!!! I have never had to actually order the TEMP of pork before! If someone does not want it well done they say so! But the only reason I'm suffering right now is because I gave them the benefit of the doubt and believed in the cooks!  IF YOU ORDER THE PORK MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM A TEMP TO!! because apparently it's a new thing to cook them medium RARE!!   My boyfriend got the strip steak which he order rare and was perfectly cooked! My girl friend got the salmon. I tried as well it was delicious. They both loved the mash potatoes!  For dessert, they had home-made doughnuts with two different sauces, a white coconut and a delicious buttery caramel. Me and my girl friend over stuffed our faces with dessert!  \"I could of skipped dinner and just had that dessert!\" - we all said.  The alcohol selection was fantastic! I've tried scotch for the first time. I don't prefer it, but it was so cool, the one mix drink they have with scotch, they hold an orange peel over the alcohol and light the top on fire. SUPER cool.  The atmosphere was beautiful, the lighting kept changing in the middle of our dinner, which was weird.   My girl friend that took me loves this place for the scotch, it's not my scene, but for someone that likes really good aged alcohol will love this place.",

Herbs and Rye is in the old Venetian Italian restaurant.  Loved the dark speakeasy vibe and brick walls.  Caution: let your eyes adjust or you will run over the hostess!  We started with the calmari appetizer.  It was crispy and served with a delicious aioli.  The crispy pancetta was a nice touch.  BTW - it was a very large serving. I order the filet mignon and it melted in my mouth!  My side was the crispy truffle french fries.  YUM!  They have an extensive cocktail list that is sectioned by time period.  I opted for the French 75.  It is one of my favorite cocktails and Herbs and Rye did not disappoint! Our server was awesome and kept us on schedule for our 7:30 show!  Love Herbs and Rye!",

    "text": "A previous reviewer's characterization of Herbs & Rye as \"old style mixology\" is wholly accurate. Seek out this local gem for the drinks, whether at the bar or in the dinning room. If you visit the latter, you will have the opportunity to peruse their historically inspired drink menu, which includes anecdotes and legends all the way back to the 1800s. This is a place you should feel entirely comfortable ordering the \"Bartender's Choice,\" a beverage custom selected and mixed to your personality. Our waiter was discerning enough to recognize that my girlfriend did not have the fruity pallette of the usual Ladies' Night patron and brought her a proper whiskey drink. Appropriately,  the hospitality matches the mixology, fostering an incredibly welcoming and appreciative atmosphere. Our waiter Christian, who some keen locals might recognize from Makers and Finders, not only remembered me from the coffee shop, but took extra care to present my girlfriend and I some of his favorite samples from both the drink and dinner menu. Let us not forget that Herbs & Rye is also a steakhouse. In the classically inspired environment with speakeasy decor, you will find your traditional, hearty butcher cuts even more savery.  Herbs & Rye is a great place for locals to become regulars. When your friends visit to experience the Boulevard, keep this in your back pocket for a surprise, after they have exhausted themselves with our city's signature extravagance and request something unassuming, delectable, and welcoming.",

It is a little steep for the food you actually get.   The ambience on the other hand is lovely. Very dark and intimate, giving it a very 20's speak easy feel.  The bartenders strike the perfect balance of being interactive but not nosy. The servers we have had are also lovely. After several rounds of drinks and shared plates we were sent a digestif  which was nice.   Definitely a place we will return to if we are hosting friends,  but not a contender to be a regular stop.",

I feel like I'm no longer in Vegas and instead I'm in a place that talks about its mob culture. The mob made money off bringing alcohol, then they built Vegas. It was the places that looked like this that made Vegas what it is.   I had the rib eye which was seasoned so perfectly. Came out a perfect medium rare. I ate the whole thing, came with a side of truffle fries that had just a nice hint of garlic, not too much like most places.   The calamari was a must. I would recommend it over most Italian places. It was a great presentation too.  The cocktails were so fun. I was trying to hit all the different eras of cocktails but I was starting to feel pretty good by the fourth set, there's a total of seven I believe.  Can't wait to go again, and impress more friends with this place!",

They butcher the meat themselves, the season it perfectly, and it's always at the right temperature you order.  The cocktails are a delight as well.  More of a trip through drinking's history than a cocktail menu, you are practically guaranteed to find your new favorite drink from this menu.  The service is top notch as well. I accidentally ordered something spicy, and before I could ask for something to be done, my meal was remade without question.  I also like a place where I am not lacking water at any time.  And then there is the happy hour.  50% off of most steaks on the menu and many drinks as well.  I paid $22 for my filet mignon.  My incredible filet mignon.  If you want a unique cocktail, a wonderful steak, impeccable service and the best price in town for it all, Herbs & Rye should be your destination.",

They have amazing specialty cocktails and their food is just wonderful. I recommend coming here for either a late night out for their happy hour after midnight or right after work for happy hour.",

For a small dinner everything came at the right time and was cooked to perfection. The menu was very enticing and I will go back when I'm in the area (and hungrier than I was). The server was fantastic and the cocktail menu was one of my favorites I have ever read with drinks from all eras. Highly recommend",

    "text": "My last dinner in Vegas and I took a friend's suggestion and headed off to Herbs & Rye on West Sahara.  It's kind of cocktail loungy but after I spent some time there, it really has an old school Steak House vibe.  This is not a dive by any means as the service is great and libations are top notch, but the steaks are really the star of this place.  The atmosphere is casual and since I was doing this meal alone, I got a seat at the bar and ordered a Macallan 12 to start.  The bartenders were great with recommendations and the history of the establishment throughout the night.  My friend had told me about the happy hour specials (half off all steaks) but I was too late for the 5 - 8 pm and too early (and too hungry to wait) for the 12 - 3 am.  I ordered a Caesar Salad and a New York Strip Steak with Whiskey Shallot Potatoes as a side.  The salad was fresh and crispy, perfect amount of dressing and cheese.  The Potatoes were really good with wonderful flavor and great texture.  Now the steak, it was more than I expected.  Done perfectly medium rare, as ordered, it was nicely seasoned and perfectly tender and juicy.  It really was as good as some of the Steakhouses I've tried on the Strip!  Even without the Happy Hour pricing, my meal with drinks came to a little more than half what I would have spent at any of the fancy steakhouse joints.  Herbs & Rye was a great suggestion, an incredible find and is a wonderful place to enjoy a quality meal and service for a very decent price.",

Since we had an early reservation (right when the restaurant opened), parking in the lot wasn't a problem at all.  The lot was full by the time we left though (~7p). Service was excellent and our server was very informative about the happy hour specials and made excellent drink recommendations.  Throughout the dining experience, they made sure no one had an empty glass.  Can't beat $5 well drinks (their well alcohol was definitely not bottom shelf stuff!).  We ordered plenty of drinks, and they were always served promptly, each one crafted to perfection! Food was amazing.  We ordered the clams for an appetizer.  The bread that they serve at all tables was delicious.  I ordered the filet mignon cooked rare ,and it was perfect!  Portions were large, and the sides were also amazing.  I had the garlic spinach and it paired perfectly with my filet. Our server brought out a plate of doughnuts with a candle to help us celebrate my brother's birthday.  That was really sweet of her, and totally unexpected. Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "This is my husband and I's go to steakhouse. We always know we will have great service and amazing food and drinks.   Let's start with the vibe. When you pull up you will definitely think this is a gaming sports bar or a strip club and from the outside that is what it looks like. But as soon as you step inside you will see what a hidden gem this is. It has a speakeasy old-school feel. Wall paper, chandeliers, wooden bar... what else could you want. I love to eat at the bar or in the bar area, just because I feel like the vibe is better and cozier, but the dining room is nice as well.   Onto cocktails. The wonderful thing about Herbs & Rye is that not only are they a fantastic steakhouse, but they put just as much effort into their craft cocktails and menu as they do their food. The menu is set up by era, so if you know what you like, it's easy to find, and if you don't the menu is fun to read. The bartenders will also give you suggestions depending on what you like. Personally I go for the Tiki Boom era every time and they make an awesome Painkiller here. Just a little note for the tiki freaks out there...  While the steaks here are great, the real star of the show are the sides. Personal Favorites: Jalapeno Creamed Corn Truffle Mac & Cheese Truffle Parmesan Steak Fries Sweet Potato Tots w/ Marshmallow Crust (OMG)  Now not just steak is on the menu of course. One of my favorite entrees here is actually not a steak. I am obsessed with the Yard Bird & Risotto. Seriously so amazing.  This place has something for everyone.",

This evening, two of my friends and I had reservations at 530PM, which were made a week in advance. (I was never told of any time limit during the time that I made a reservation.) We each ordered a meal and more than one glass of wine. At 730PM an employee came to our table, I believe he was apart of the managerial staff. He said, \"You ladies will now have to leave, because our reservations are for 2 hour increments and our next reservation is here.\" We said okay, but each of us still had a glass of wine left. Not three minutes later he came back with a horrible attitude, speaking sternly to us, saying, \"You have to leave now, the reservation for this table is here.\" I told him we still had wine and he shrugged his shoulders, repeated himself and walked away. This is horrible business. We had already paid our check and because they had received our money, no customer service was provided to us. None of us will ever return to Herbs and Rye and I'm sure everyone we tell about this incident won't either. I'm so disappointed with the lack of care and customer service.",

Couple that with the fact that they have half price during happy hour and I can't think of a reason why anybody wouldn't return over and over.

All of the happy hour items are marked on the menu. Great half off prices on steaks, including a side. The Mac and cheese was amazing. They start you off with bread that is also very good.   The cocktails aren't on happy hour, but if you like a cocktail, don't let that stop you. So many choices, some of which are made pretty elaborately. It was interesting to sit at the bar, talk to the bartenders, and watch them make the drinks.   We had a little snafu with our bill at the end, but it was minor.",

We saw that this place has amazing value during Happy Hour, so we decided to make a trip to give it a try. We made reservations for 7pm on a Thursday in June. We arrived at 7:05pm and the front desk ushered us in at 7:10pm. Server quickly served us water and kept our glass filled all night. Our waitress, Debra, was quick to follow up and provide us information on the menu. Bread was bought to us by the server promotly. Debra was excellent at providing us recommendations on the type of cut we should get.   We ordered at 7:32pm - a half priced Ribeye and filet mignon with sides of button mushrooms and grilled asparagus. Our food arrived at 8:00pm.  Filet mignon - ordered medium well and it is exactly what we got. Juicy and tender all around.  Ribeye - the 14oz is huge! Great flavours and a great sear on both sides. Cooked medium well to perfection.  Sides - the asparagus and mushrooms were simple, and cooked as expected in garlic butter sauce.  With the HH from 5-8pm, we will try to come back again when we return to Vegas.",

Each steak order (unless otherwise noted) comes with one side. I usually go for the mushrooms and creamed corn. + If you split/share.. there's an additional charge. Note : Don't bring people who aren't eating their own meal.  + free bread is good + Don't be scared by the grungy exterior look. This place is worth it.

    "text": "I am giving Herbs & Rye a low star rating solely for the poor management of reservations. This is the 4th time I have been here in the last month and a half (on various nights of the week, weeknights & weekends), and ALL FOUR TIMES I have been sat significantly past my reservation time (and I have always arrived before my reservation time). Each time the host team has simply apologized and said that they were running a bit behind. Once is understandable. Twice is acceptable. Now I am simply questioning why I continue to return to this restaurant. (The reality is, I keep coming back because the food, cocktails & service staff are all 5 star, but this will only go so far if I am always waiting over 30 minutes past my reservation time.)  To add insult to injury for tonight's reservation, I had confirmed that we would have a child in our party when H&R called to confirm this afternoon. 21 minutes past our initial reservation time, I got the text saying that our table was ready. When we went inside to be seated, they told us that the table they had for us was in the bar, and we would have to wait for a table in the dining room because of the child. This was infuriating, as, Again, I confirmed with them this afternoon that there was a child in our party; this was not new information. We were finally sat 20 minutes later, 40 minutes past our initial reservation time, and 55 minutes after arriving at the restaurant.   I would like to reiterate that this is not the first time that this has happened; had it been the first time, I would have written it off as an off night for the restaurant. This wait time has become all too consistent. If this issue is fixed the next time I dine here (if there is a next time at this point), I will gladly update my review/rating. This has been my favorite restaurant in town for a few years now, and I am having a difficult time wanting to go back.  Joe, our server, was outstanding. He was 5 Stars all the way.",

We came for a good steak. We both got 8 oz. flatirons. His medium rare and mine medium. It comes with a side so we got garlic mashed potatoes. Both were really good and for about $15 a plate, you can't really be mad if it wasn't. Steak was good and if I lived here I'd probably be eating a lot of steak there. We also got buffalo wings which were average.  The ambiance was nice, super dark and we sat in the booths that face the bar. Our server was cool. He'd periodically check in and was very nice.",

Outside of the restaurant is nothing really to look it but inside you will find a hidden gem.  It reminded me of a dark lounge-y type restaurant complete with an old bar smell.  They specialize it cocktails ranging from gothic age (1800's) - revival age (present).  I had a little cold so the server suggested a mocktail, something I've never had before.  It was excellent; tasted like a refreshing blend of citrus cucumber and mint which worked wonders for my throat.    For appetizers we ordered the clams, calamari and bistecca flatbread.  They definitely do not skimp on the servings.  We had 5 people in our party and it was way more than enough.  For our on-trays my friends all ordered the steak but I settled on the linguine with clams.  It was DELISH.  I lost count of all the clams.  I felt like I had clams with linguine.  The steak came with a choice of sides.  I got to sample the mushrooms, mac and cheese, and jalapeno corn.  GET THE Jalapeno corn.  You will not be disappointed.  I have never tasted anything like it and now I don't want my corn any other way.  The steaks were HAPPY hour prices but full size servings.  We all had to be rolled out with our doggy bags.",

My friend decided she wanted extra spices on her steak but didn't ask if it was spicy so when out steak came out she wasn't very happy, I decided to switch with her and thought it was great... If it was something you wanted.   The side were really great we have the Mac and cheese, asparagus, fries, and I forget what else. We all agreed the best thing was the fries.

He asked what other cocktails I've tried before and I told him none with cognac. He gave me a sidecar which is what I expected. It was a great classic cocktail. The sugared rim was a nice touch. After that I ordered a 9 oz. filet mignon and \"sprouts and swine\" for the side. I ordered the filet medium and it was cooked perfectly. The brussel sprouts were a little overdone but still quite delicious.  Ambience was nice. There was a great selection of alcohol to check out and make a mental check list. When I got there they were playing some smooth jazz and transitioned into some mellow hip hop, my personal favorite.   Overall I had a great experience and appreciated that the bartender used my name almost every time he addressed me. Very classy joint with impeccable service. Seriously, if you want a good steak and a great cocktail then you should check this place out.  P.S. Get the donuts. They are \"Dynamite!\"",

The host&hostess were nice but our server \"Charlie\" was probably one of my favorite things about this place. I loved his personality and he was very knowledgeable of the menu. He was chill and just seemed like someone I would hang out with on a daily!   Now let's get to the food! As a appetizer we ordered the calamari, which was huge for just two people. We agreed that there wasn't enough calamari and sauce and a little too much pepperoncini. The touch of bacon on it is really good though. For our main course we ordered one of the surf and turfs that come with two lobster tails and a 18oz steak. The lobster comes on a bed of mashed potatoes that doesn't even need gravy because it's so good! The steak on a bed of asparagus which was also very good! We ordered the herbs and rye spice rub sauce and Charlie made the excellent choice of putting it on the side because it was a little too spicy for me! Other than that the steak and lobster was good enough without the sauce itself! Oooo moving on to desert we ordered the creme brulee ! This creme brulee is probably the best I've ever had in life! The texture of it just melts in your mouth. The amount of sugar on top is perfect and there's just a vanilla bean after taste that's just to die for!   Overall we had an amazing experience since we walked in and I will only be going there if Charlie is my server! We love you Charlie!   Also the restaurant itself is pretty casual wear and it's pretty dim inside. So when I took this picture with the flash on I definitely got some attention sorry I'm not used to eating so fancy!",

Their brussels spouts are one of my favorite recipes; made with bacon and topped with cheese. There's nothing special about the mushrooms, so nothing to write home about. The NY steak came out rare instead of medium rare. So if that matters to you, then order the next temperature up. I don't mind it when its high quality beef. And the right cut. A cool-centered ribeye steak probably would've been chewy and gross... I've tried it before. And I love me some ribeye.",

We didn't have a reservation but it only took us 15 minutes to get a table. Cozy great date night place. Happy hour is 5pm-8pm and also midnight-3am. Steaks and most cocktails are 1/2 price.  Warm crusty Italian bread with butter served while you wait. I had the Ribeye with whiskey potatoes and the hubby had the filet with garlic mash. Both excellent dishes s cooked to perfection. This place is a hidden gem!",

This place is misleading from its shabby exterior which changes immediately as you walk into the stream of classic hip hop.   The strip's commercial aspect is too much for me after a while, so this place's vibes kept me calm when popping in.   Known for serving all classic cocktails from the US, the Vieux Carre from New Orleans is a bar favorite. Try it out! If you don't like it, the friendly bartenders are more than happy to make you whatever you'd like.  Joe was especially kind to us, along with the rest of the staff.

    "text": "We made reservations the morning of on their website and received an email confirmation no later than 2-3 hours later. We originally had reservations for 7:00PM on a Monday night to try and make it for their happy hour deal. Unfortunately we were running a little behind schedule so I called around 6:00PM that Monday to see if we could push our reservations back. I got the machine but left a message to see if we can change our reservations to 7:30PM. Michelle kindly called back within 30 minutes and let me know that it'll be no problem to come in at 7:30PM.  We arrived and were told it'd take a moment to set up our table but we could hang out in the bar area. They have an extensive cocktail menu that was a bit overwhelming to read. My boyfriend and I ordered drinks, he got the zombie and I got the blinker. The moscow mule and pisco sour caught my eye, but the blinker was actually pretty strong so I felt like I couldn't(shouldn't) order a second drink. I was constantly looking at my cellphone for the time and at the host to see if he knew where we were (or remembered what we looked like) to be able to tell us when our table was ready. After about 20 minutes we were invited to our table. We settled our drink bill at the bar and got seated.  After we put in our order, our server was nice enough to tell us that we were able to make it in time for happy hour (with only 4 minutes to spare before it was 8pm), so we got a few dishes at happy hour price - which is a really good deal for the quality of the food.  We ordered the beef carpaccio to start, then shared the linguine and clams and the 18 ounce ribeye cooked medium. The linguine and clams and the ribeye were at happy hour prices (which is 50% off). The linguine and clams was delicious, the white wine sauce was perfectly balanced. It was thin in consistency and not over garlic-y. The dish came with a piece of bread which we both used to soak up extra sauce. The ribeye was good, I usually prefer ribeye over because the rich flavor it has to the cut. Our piece was cooked perfectly and was more than enough to share - we found ourselves pushing our limits on the last few bites because it was so good we couldn't stop. The cut was a bit fatty (as ribeyes usually are) but I personally like the charred fatty bites.   We had planned to go to dinner as a celebratory event and stated that in the reservation but didn't think much of it. Our server seemed dodgy when we were trying to get his attention, but turned out he eventually told us he was stalling for time because they were cooking up some complimentary donuts for us! What a sweet gesture. My boyfriend isn't really a sweets person (he NEVERRRRRRR eats dessert when we go out for dinner) but he could not resist the fresh donuts drizzled in caramel sauce. It was so good. We had a good experience. If you're looking to go, I'd definitely recommend going during happy hour and making a reservation!",

We visit Vegas from out of town often & typically pop in for a cocktail or two, but finally made time for dinner. We'd originally made reservations for 8 o'clock, however, after finding out that happy hour runs from 5-8 (they do also have a late night happy hour), we made an attempt to arrive early to catch the half off steaks on happy hour! We arrived early & they were very understanding & accommodating & were able to seat us in time to make happy hour! My sister & I decided to share the 18oz ribeye, & my husband & friend had their own 14 oz New York Strips. We were pleasantly surprised to find that each steak comes with a complimentary side, so we all decided to share the Mac & Cheese, Brussels, Creamed Corn, & Steak Cut Fries. We also each enjoyed a cocktail - dirty martini, mezcal negroni, cucumber vodka water & my sister opted for a Cabernet. Everything, & I mean everything was amazing. The food & drink, the ambiance, the service. We had such a wonderful experience that when my mom & I return to Vegas later this month for a girls trip we'll be coming here for dinner & my husband will be back with a group of friends for a Bachelor Party later in July as well! Can't wait to be back & would highly recommend Herbs & Rye for a nice dinner out away from the hustle & bustle of the strip.",

We came in for a double birthday celebration, all of us had drinks and steaks/pasta mostly and JOE made sure everything was flawless. He explained all the rules to us and it was smooth sailing from then on. All the drinks were amazing. I had a Manhattan. Steaks and couple of other things are all 50% off during happy hour and, wow!

However, Herbs & Rye definitely did it.  We didn't make a reservation, but we were able to be seated right away even though it seemed pretty busy for a Tuesday night.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which we could have lived without.  For our entree, we decided to share the \"King Kong Ribeye,\" which is 60 oz. & normally $190, but because it was happy hour & 50% off, it was $80! I definitely recommend taking advantage of that kind of deal! You also get to choose two sides. It was all so good. We obviously didn't finish it & had to take leftovers home, but my boyfriend was full & satisfied for once.  I forgot my ID & couldn't order any cocktails, but I'm sure I'll be back.",

    "text": "Love the ambiance and beautiful bar at Herbs and Rye. Last night it was definetly a miss. Sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited for our table. My date ordered a MGD, my drink was made, served and his never arrived. The bartender was drinking shots with the men to our left and women to our right. Another party of four arrived and sat next to us. Bartender came to serve them and he asked for a beer again, never got it. Had to ask a completely different bartender and it finally arrived. A twenty five minute wait for a table turned into an hour (but it was Friday and HH). Got seated at 745 and promptly ordered our meals to score the HH steak price. Had the meatballs as appetizers and they were great!!! Slighlty spicey, but the goat cheese, melts slightly, rounds out the flavor giving it a silky smooth taste in your mouth. Ordered two medium ribeye, tasty steak but the steak hindered on medium rare rare and was more purple inside. Both steaks were undercooked. I informed the waiter and he took one steak back to cook a little longer. A steak is never the same redone and I was disappointed to go to a GREAT steakhouse and have the steak very undercooked. The Brussel sprouts were a miss as well. Extremely charred, one piece of swine and LOADS of cheese ontop. Normally I wouldn't care about the extra cheese, but I wondered if the cheese were hiding the burnt Brussels and lack of swine? Normally the brusses are fantastic!! Cut into fourths, slightly steamed and grilled to carmalize on one side (not all four and black). The swine ontop is cut to resemble thick pieces of panchetta and sprinkled all over. The one piece of swine was black, hard and not even edible. Overall dinner was a hit and miss. After the no beer, wait time, undercooked steak and burnt brussels we did not even stay for the AMAZING donuts (sigh). Being a steakhouse and price of the meal my expectations were that our food would be prepared as requested. Sending a steak back at a steakhouse is never a good thing.",

    "text": "great prohibition-y vibe with an extensive menu of cocktails, but the actual cocktails don't live up to the rep this place puts forward.   Service was super lackluster.  Came at about 6:30 on a weekday and waited probably an hour to get our food. When I asked the waiter if our food was coming soon, he had the gall to ask, \"Do you have to be somewhere? Is there a certain time you need to leave by\"   So..... if I said 8, would you wait til a half hr before to get me my food? What kills me, was that it wasn't even busy... other reviews might talk about the waiters running around with their heads cut off, but it was not even busy.   3 stars for the amazing deal on steaks (got a kansas flat iron for 14$... really not bad)   but there are virtually not HH drink deals (all 13$), and the other food was very average and expensive.   I.e.,   flatbread - bruschetta style -- very mediocre $15  Mac and Cheese, --only plus was the truffle flavor, but otherwise nothign special  Prosciutto penna pasta -- a whopping 22$ and it did not knock my socks off.   We asked the bartender (i think the owner) to make 3 different cocktails and he could not get it right... for a place that touts such an expansive list, you'd think he could make 1 well balanced cocktail, but he didn't really know what he was doing.  To his credit, was a nice guy, so 3 stars for that and the food)",

And, as with all the foodie places he takes me to whenever I'm in town, this place did not disappoint. I'm so happy to be friends with a foodie. Yay!  Their drinks are solid. Well... except for this aviator thing. I think it's more of a preference and I prefer not to drink perfume... but let's forget about that and get to the good parts because that's what I'm all about.  Good friends will switch drinks with you and that's exactly what my friend did! haha, thanks friend! I wish I remembered what the damn drink was called because I really want that thing again. It was some ginger beer concoction... it took me back to my days working in SF where I would order a dark and stormy. Damn... I miss living in the Bay.",

    "text": "Went during happy hour at 5; they don't even open until 5. These are pretty good quality steaks. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but at half-price, I wouldn't mind making a return trip, though there are still too many steaks in Vegas I haven't tried. I ordered the rib-eye but would probably try the filet mignon next time. All steaks come with one side of your choice, which is pretty awesome for someone that doesn't like when you're limited to potatoes or chef's vegetables. I ordered the truffle mac 'n cheese, but I didn't notice any truffles, was probably just truffle oil. The asparagus that someone else got looked really good, though that side didn't seem as large, about 5-7 spears.  I agree the place is too dark, I too couldn't tell how well cooked my steak was with the lack of lighting.  The online menu (as of 8/27/12) does not do the place justice. Their in house menu is far more extensive, with a good number of half-priced happy hour items.  Also, the outside of the restaurant looks like crap, but the inside is pretty nice.",

Very not-Vegas. no gambling. no smoking. and an awesome happy hour that goes until 8.   half. priced. steaks. and not crummy steaks like you might expect for half price. tender, flavorful, nicely cooked cuts of meat.  they've got a couple HH beer specials, but sadly no specials on their amazing assortment of drinks.  it's a very prohibition era, speakeasy kind of feel to the place, and they serve old-school cocktails that have ingredients like absinthe and bitters and rye.... orange peels set on fire.... really fun stuff.  and their sweet potato tots and truffled mac & cheese..... i get them every time. and usually a second order of mac and cheese to go to eat at home in my pjs later that night...   we also ate here with a large group once and they were so accommodating! perfectly separate checks, patience, attentiveness. we even had vegetarians and vegans in our group and they worked with everyone to make sure dietary needs were met - it was a great place for a group.   closed sundays - which, like chick-fil-a, ends up being the day i have a massive craving, so just try to plan ahead so you don't get your hopes dashed!",

    "text": "I had heard nothing but good things about this restaurant so finally on November 30th of last year I took my daughter there for a special birthday dinner.  That's how long I have been trying to connect with management at this restaurant.  The only thing worse than the service we got from our server Ronnie was the treatment I got today from Valerie.  Admittedly, she did call me back soon after the incident but I was out of town for a family death and her call went to voicemail.  Today, after my many calls Valerie finally called me back and she insisted that we had spoken previously since she was familiar with my situation.  Yes, she was probably familiar with it because I had spoken on numerous occasions with Jessica, who was always friendly and professional.   So yes, once they re-did our over cooked steaks the food was excellent, the service? hmmmm not so much.   Would I be so brazen to think that maybe this manager Valerie is a family member?  How else could one be so bold to verbally assault  a customer fearing no repercussions.  To the owner: if she's not family you need to be aware that she is doing you a huge disservice  The one star is for the great food, but staff can take away from what should have been a joyous experience.  How does a business maintain a 5 star rating?  By remembering what it took to obtain those 5 stars and do not ignore the one star customer experience. People will always remember a good experience but a bad experience will be forever etched in their mind and their word.  Update:  now I ask you given the \"owners\" response.  Who sounds crazy in this equation?  Who wants to eat at a restaurant whose owner responds in this fashion?  Is it any wonder his staff behaves as they do?  Look at his example.  If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be hysterically funny.",

    "text": "Stay for the solid handcrafted cocktails and delicious pasta dishes. But while Herbs & Rye touts itself as a steakhouse, you might want to pass on their cuts.   For the past year, I've been hearing great things about this local Vegas favorite. Styled after the Prohibition era, this dimly-lit Italian speakeasy offers some great seafood pasta, flatbreads, and drinks. They're also the only place I've ever eaten at that offers happy hour for their steaks. Unfortunately, the New York strip that I ordered was overseasoned and underwhelming. However, at half the retail price of $42, I couldn't complain too much. If you're struggling to decide on a side, get the truffle mac & cheese, which was beyond cheesy.   For appetizers, the beef tartar was amazing. I also highly recommend the linguine & clams. The white wine and garlic sauce was superb. I usually try not to eat too much bread, but I couldn't resist dipping it in the sauce. And of course, the comprehensive list of cocktails was impressive. Organized by era, it features plenty of classics that will be sure to bring you back to the days of the Rat Pack. Service was great. Our waitress was able to squeeze in a few latecomers' orders to include the happy hour price. Happy hour runs from 5:00-8:00 pm so be sure drop in.",

Gabby the young lady that escorted me had a very nice trophy with a negative 4 on it. I was so impressed and she let me hold the trophy, so fancy. She was so inviting and welcomed me like if I was family. The bar staff all greeted me like if I was walking into their home. I felt more welcomed than walking into my mothers house. In reality I have been to Herbs multiple times and I come here because it is a five star operation. The owner and the staff are a True family and treat each other as such. It is very contagious and everyone that walks in is treated like family. The interesting thing about family is that if you are a horrible person your family will let you know. Therefore if you walk into Herbs & Rye and have a bad experience it probably because you suck at life and are a cancer on society. Therefore they are packed and do not need you anyways. The moral of the story is this. If you suck as a person don't go. If you are cool and want to go to an amazing establishment that will provide one of the city's best experiences than please make a reservation it will be a life changing event!",

(PS If you get there at 7:50, like we did, they'll give you til a few min after 8pm to get the order in. So nice!)  Here's what we drank....basically everything.  I wish I remembered the specific drinks - every single thing we ordered was not only inventive, but very well balanced (which is the #1 thing I look for in a cocktail).  Their cocktail menu takes you on a delicious tour through the many eras of booze.  We ordered the beef tartare: it was excellent!  I'm super picky about beef tartare, and this one was delicious and had a great presentation as well.  We also ordered the filet and some asparagus.  Of which, we ate every last bite.  I will definitely be back - happy hour or otherwise.",

The bistecca flatbread was probably my least favorite bc of the small pieces of steak and over abundance of arugula! The ribeye was perfectly cooked! A nice char on the outside, seasoned simply, and perfectly tender. The truffle Mac and cheese is very rich, but if you're a True cheese lover, you will be delighted! They had well seasoned topping for the steak. The mushrooms and spinach put all those salty, savory tastebuds to work! Definitely a great place to visit in Vegas!",

Well anyways HERBS & RYE let me start by saying what an amazing experience. The food was phenomenal, the service was extremely well educated & knowledgeable Charlie knew everything on the menu, I've never attended there and he went down the whole menu with me. Charlie told me about an amazing drink called \"black Thorne\" & let me say that was sooo yummy it's creepy to say that's my favorite drink now (I'm a tequila drinker not gin) & it's only $13 (oh yeah my server was so dope he wrote down this recipe for me)!!!!!!  I had surf and turf  and it was just soooo perfect !!! The lobster was just to die for, the Mac and cheese made me melt!!! One thing that i would like is for the light to be a little brighter ... other then that what an amazing experience and thank you sooooo much Charlie for educating me. I will be back for happy hour. You all are amazing !! Thank youuuuu!!! I unfortunately i took videos not pictures ........ next time i know to take pictures !!! My videos are to die for ... oh well next time.",

That's right, half off. Included with your steak is also a side of your choice. Our server was Charlie, and he was not only extremely helpful with what to order drink and food wise he was very attentive and funny! We had a table of 4, all ordered some type of steak and split all of our sides family style. The steaks were all cooked to perfection and the sides were plenty for us to share.  I also had a wedge salad that was amazing!! The drinks are also delicious. GO HERE, like tonight!!! You wont be disappointed",

I suggest making a reservation just to confirm you have a table in the dining room or the bar area. If you come here you definitely have to try the prime rib it was fabulous.

This chill bar, dimly lit by the ornate chandeliers and homey brick & paisley wallpaper, fed us well with tasty treats such as flat bread pizzas, wings, salads and for the one in our party who wanted a proper meal - Pigs & Figs!

The food is delicious from the steaks to the sides to the desserts. However, what I didn't expect was to pay more than 30% gratuity. The gratuity, it appears, is based on the full menu price of the items AND taxes. As a server, the government has never calculated my tips on taxes, so to pay gratuity on taxes seems a bit ridiculous. When I researched yelp to see if anyone else had commented on this, I noticed several did. Then I noticed, one guy, received a response from the owner; which was incredibly rude. I've never seen a response like that and I can't imagine someone being in business with that attitude. Want to see for yourself? Go to Herbs and Rye and in the search box place the word gratuity, then search for Bob C. Amazing! I'm secretly hoping the owner responds to my review, so I won't feel bad not returning. I considered it until I read her response. WOW!",

Happy hour is 5 - 8 and the steaks are half off including limited other menu items.  I had the filet mignon which cut like butter and the flavor was mouth watering. For the side dishes we tried the jalapeno cream corn, truffle mac & cheese and garlicky spinach. Everything was great! They also serve many different vintage drinks.  We tried the Gin Frizz , very original and tasty.  There menu prices are a bit high so I recommend happy hour.",

These guys have hospitality in their genes!! Always a great time and I literally live for the clams and cheeeeesy broccoli they are so good!!! Great hospitality with amazing food, what more could you want in a neighborhood bar/restaurant?!!   Only downside is the bigger guy with the long beard. He literally looks like he would be in excruciating pain if he had to smile and kindly acknowledge a guest at his bar. It makes you feel really uncomfortable when he turns around every five minutes to talk quietly to another bartender with his head down. Dear Mr Mean Bartender Guy, I hope 2016 is better for you and you can find some happiness because it's a small part of a job as a bartender to talk to, engage with, I don't know, not snarl at your guests who are spending money at your bar.    Thanks for all the great times herbs babies!! New cool hipster host dude is pretty cool too. :)",

    "text": "I have passed by this place multiple times because my friend used to work at a restaurant close by. I have also wanted to try it, epecially since they do have HH! However, I'm not a steak fan nor do I spend tons of money eating out.    I had the perfect opportunity to go the other day for my friend's birthday. I got there exactly at 6 which was the reservation time. The waitress was very friendly as she asked us if we wanted any cocktails or appetizers (I get it, it's her job to upsell and ask.) However, we were still waiting on the rest of our late party.    Finally everyone arrived. My friend ordered the beef carpaccio which had balsamic vinegarette, and tasted sour. It had arugula on top. I loved the veggies, but not the sour taste of the dressing. We ordered our food at approximately 6:30, and did not receive it until past 7:11. I get it. We were a large party (we had 12 people). My friend asked for extra bread. The waitress said she would put it in right away. We did not get it until my other friend asked 40 minutes later. Now, I'm not a steak fan, so I can't give too much opinion on my steak. When our food arrived, she gave me brussel sprouts instead of the truffle mac and cheese that I had ordered. The waitress did fix that mistake and bring me mac and cheese. Someone in our party did not receive his steak. There were issues with that which you can read in other reviews.  Half of the steak was medium rare and the other half was medium. I had ordered medium. My steak was COLD! As though it had been sitting there for a while. Maybe it was because I ordered mine medium and everyone else ordered theirs medium rare, so they cooked mine first and let it sit? I don't know.  The mac and cheese was nice and hot, but it just made my steak seem super cold.   They cleared our table  and gave each person a small plate and said it was for dessert since it was a birthday. Our waitress brought out the check and gave it to the birthday boy. Uh... we asked for separate checks.  10 min later she came back and said we can't do separate checks.  So we would have to calculate the price with tax and gratuity and tell them how much to put on each card. What a HUGE inconvenience.    The manager came up to us and was told us that he would take care of us to get us out. UH... YEA that's what we were trying to do... You guys had your strict regulation of not splitting checks. You think I wanted to sit there and ponder over how much I owed. I felt that was super rude of him because I felt like he was wanted to get us out of there and just get rid of us.  The dessert finally came out, and it was beignets that I read in other reviews that they received complimentary. They didn't even give us enough for everyone in the party, and why did they even need to give us plates?  Plus it took FOREVERRRR!  Like, it was free, so I shouldn't really complain, but it came right as the manager came over to say that he was going to \"take care of us.\"   Something weird, when eating the appetizer, I didn't use my silverware, so when the waitress brought out the steak knives and forks, she took my napkin and silverware. Was she going to reuse? I didn't think much of it at the time, but I didn't have a napkin. Why the heck would you take mine?!?   I'm not a fan of steak to ever come here again after the horrible service I had. The food was okay, but again steak is not my thing. I spent $18. I could have made my own steak and mac and cheese for way less and not experienced that.",

Drinks, wow, very colorful and detailed cocktails that I'm coming back to try more.    Oh, the mac and cheese bacon was not what I was expecting.  It was good, but not as good as everyone made it to be.  Its seriously mac and cheese with cut up pieces of bacon and then they slap on a bacon slice as a topping.  I've changed my mac and cheese expectations for all the various mac and cheese I've tried around town :P  Great place to get away from the Las Vegas strip life.  They have a video DJ that plays some 80-90's goodies that had me bobbin' my head.  BTW, DJ in a restaurant means seriously loud music.

We got the mac and cheese, sauteed garlic spinach (we had to send back and ask for no salt as when it came out it was DOUSED with salt. Inedible really), the creamed corn and brussel sprouts. The jalapeno creamed corn didn't have the kick I was looking for, I already told you about the not so garlicy spinach, the brussel sprouts were OK and the mac and cheese was OK to. The service was slow. Our waiter didn't seem to care to much about keeping our drinks full or bringing out the food quickly.

Service was a bit off, also, as we had to ask for bread when the entrees were delivered, and the server's response was, \"Oh, you'd like more?\" when we hadn't had any to begin with! We hope it was just an off-night, so I'm knocking a couple stars off until our next visit.",

We drink these every night... no, seriously, EVERY night, which means that we've had Old Fashioned at cocktail bars all over the country. We're a tough crowd and we'd probably rank this a 7.5. Good, good stuff. I had an excellent cocktail but, of course, forgot the name. We got the bisteca flatbread and some fries to share. Fries: Good. Flatbread: Very good.  Service was friendly, prompt, and helpful. We are at the bar and the bartenders took good care of us, even throwing a couple of drinks our way when the entire bar was toasting a birthday girl, and we were the odd men out. How cool!  We did have some trouble with the bill, which took a couple iterations to get right, but they were very sweet, apologetic, and accommodating. Nobody's perfect and, quite frankly, I dealt with something similar at another establishment earlier that day, which was not dealt with with nearly the same humility and helpfulness--so I was happy and charmed.  In all, we really had a great night. The best part, really, was the warmth of the whole staff. My husband's family lives on the same side of town, and we are frequently looking for a late-night joint to escape to after his folks go to bed. This place definitely tops the list. We can't wait to come back.  The cocktail list looks like a blast and I'm looking forward to many joyful samplings.",

A solid three stars is my guess. There's a great selection of cocktails from the older times of these being the \"cool drinks\" and some great food.  If I had to pay the full price (go during Happy Hour...period) I'm sure there'd be less stars given, but for the price (and company of friends in a trendy place) I'll keep it on the list of places to go.",

Waiter started out by allowing us to have 15 min to look at the drink menu, not because we needed time, but because he ignored us. We ordered drinks and it took 10 min to get 4/5 of them...and 20 more min (even after saying twice to get her drink) to get the 5th. Then he \"memorized\" our steak orders and when the steaks came out...every single order was wrong. What should have been a nice 90 min meal ended up being 3 hours because the service was dreadful. This place should fire their waitstaff.",

The room is beautiful, the red walls compliment the prohibition style concept.

Go see for yourself, I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.",

    "text": "In wanting to get off the Vegas Strip, I sent out a call for recommendations and received a great one for Herbs and Rye, located in a somewhat seedy part of Vegas on W.Sahara. Don't let the outside location deter you. The inside of Herbs and Rye had a great, dark vibe and was definitely not a Vegas Strip kinda place. I am quite certain its a local hang out. In fact, if I lived in Vegas- I would be a regular for sure. They specialize in craft cocktails, a favorite of mine and the reason why my buddy and I went. I had a Buck's Fizz (on the menu) which was a great refresher followed up by a Pimm's Cup (not on the menu) which was done well, although with Ginger Ale instead of Ginger Beer. My buddy had a Moscow Mule which was great and quite large drink which kept him occupied during our whole stay. The menu is divided into cocktail \"eras\" such as \"pre-prohibition\", etc. I thought that was a cool touch. A pleasant surprise was the food. Being a cocktail place they don't do drink happy hours, which I admire- however they do food happy hours...with several dishes offered at a discount. To take advantage I had the mussels in a spicy tomato sauce and my buddy had the fillet and mashed potatoes. Both were excellent and a great deal. So, in addition to recommending this place for a great pre-strip hopping cocktail, I would definitely get there for some grub prior to going back to the stock tourists hang outs.",

Half off all steaks and other menu items and their well drinks. Can't beat that. First off the cocktail list is amazing and is divided by the era which the drink came from. Which I thought was pretty cool. But they have a huge selection of alcohol so you'll be sure to find something you like. Wife and I shared everything we had the rib eye medium rare which was cooked perfect and had the chimichurri sauce with it and it was great. The seafood linguine is a lot of food and taste excellent. The beef carpaccio is really good amazingly refreshing for being a beef dish. We ordered several cocktails all which were done great. The place feels very old school vegas kinda dark steakhouse. We took an uber because the park lot isn't very big which was a 6dollar uber fare. Will definitely come back especially for the happy hour which can get busy.",

It was very very dark inside upon entering but my eyes adjusted very quickly. The menu is super cool. The drinks are organized by prohibition eras. I started with a Bee's Knees and really enjoyed it. They have a huge selection of just about every alcohol and mixer. Our server was very nice and attentive. She gave us the 411 on their happy hour deal. Basically, all of their steak meals are 50% off between 5-8pm and then after midnight. It comes with 1 delicious side dish but we ordered 2. The Caesar salad was split into two bowls and that was almost a meal in itself. The NY strip was cooked perfectly and the whole meal was great. The Happy Hour deal is also for the entire restaurant, not just the bar area.  It is a ways away from the strip but well worth the trip. Not walkable from the strip. Next time I am back in town, this is my new go to dinner place for delicious steaks.",

When we arrived the parking lot was completely full, but someone was pulling out so we were able to grab a parking place.  Upon entering the restaurant we stood at the tiny entrance long enough for our eyes to adjust to the extreme dark.  After negotiating my way to the host counter, I put in for our party of three and they told us it would be a few minutes for a table.  It took maybe ten minutes, which I felt was perfectly reasonable given how packed the place was.    We sat in the bar area and had two waiters taking care of us.  Both of them were fantastic, they were engaging and on point the whole evening.  The one guy who occasionally came by to top of the waters was a little challenged with getting the water in the glasses, but our waiters were awesome.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer, the calamari itself was a little rubbery but the cheese, parma and cherry peppers were fantastic.  For my meal I ordered the Rib Eye (medium rare) and the Jalapeno Creamed Corn.  The steak was perfectly cooked and had a great flavor.  The portion sizes are huge so even though I ordered the smallest steak I still only finished about 2/3 of it.  The real highlight was the jalapeno creamed corn, this I demolished and could have eaten more.  It may not be as creamy as it is in the South, but it was still altogether fantastic.  All in all a very pleasant dining experience.",

We came during their happy hour (5pm-8pm) that includes 50% off all steaks, several appetizers (mussels and clams) and a pasta dish. Their signature cocktails are not included in HH but all well drinks are half off.  We ordered the ribeye and New York strip steak and both did not disappoint. The rib eye was an extremely large portion so if you have a small appetite, definitely get this to share. ($7 surcharge to split plates though) We topped both steaks with mushrooms and onions (3.75 extra) and it was worth it! It comes with a heaping amount and made the steak that much better.   For our sides we chose the Brussels sprouts (Sprouts & Swine) and the truffle Mac and cheese. Definitely get the sprouts, It's a few dollars extra but so worth. Comes with blackened Brussels sprouts, thick cut bacon, and crispy cheese! It was just as good if not better than the steaks. The Mac n cheese was nothing special, I'd pass on this and try the potatoes.  Our server was very thorough in explaining the menu to us first timers. Be sure to ask about their desserts. (not on menu)  I think I found my new happy hour spot! No more PTs pizza and quesadillas for me, I'm moving on up to filet mignon!!",

Once I heard about their great happy hour, I had to return during this trip. They have drink specials and 50% of steaks and other selected foods. Yes, please. During this visit, we had the linguine and clams which was good but not as memorable as I wanted it to be. I had to have the tomato basil soup and grilled cheese again this time around. I love it. I also had the New York strip with a blue cheese crusted top. It was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. Don't give it a second thought. Add Herbs and Rye to your restaurant list.",

They have an AMAZING happy hour with half off steaks and well drinks. I order the filet mignon, with sides of truffle Mac and cheese (because truffle!), and the mashed potatoes. My husband gets the New York Strip or ribeye. They also have an excellent bar area with drinks inspired by the decades. I highly recommend trying this place out, if you haven't already!

From the outside, you'd never guess the cool, dark ambiance inside.  The steak happy hour (half off steaks!) is pretty incredible and hard to resist at a steakhouse. If you have any appetite for a steak while you're here, just go for it. We also got the beef sliders, which were delicious and definitely worth getting, and the wings, which were good but not blow-it-out-of-the-park good. Even the bread basket was good and warm.   Even with all the extensive Yelp reviews, I had no idea how big the cocktail menu was going to be. The menu itself is laid out in a fun way, so you can learn a lot while you pick your cocktail. The pisco sour and pimms cup we got were right on point (not on happy hour, though).  Overall, this spot was definitely cool and something different. If you're in the downtown area and jonesing for a cocktail or steak, you should check out H&R.",

Had to drive around twice, including completely around the block to be able to park in the back alley a bit away from the restaurant.  Had a reservation for 7pm, and was a few minutes early (thankfully for the parking situation), and was taken right in.  Ordered the \"wedge\" salad, and the Filet Mignon with creamed spinach.  There's no \"wedge\" about this salad folks. It's roughly the size of a half of a head of lettuce. Yes, that large. I couldn't finish it, even going back to it after the steak.  The Filet Mignon was done perfectly, as was the spinach.  The service was top notch.  Another place I'll keep in mind for future Vegas visits.",

My parents owned a fine dining restaurant while I was growing up and I have over ten years FOH experience, and Herbs & Rye really impressed me.  I'm vegan, and the menu has very few vegan items but I spoke to the waiter and the chef made me a delicious veggie medley with Brussels sprouts, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms..it was so delicious.  They cooked it in wine and it tasted amazing.  I hope you all consider putting more vegan friendly dishes in your menu!!  It will bring you more business--not that it wasn't packed last night!  I can tell this is a local fav by many folks.    Also I want to mention the efficiency and good communication with the bartenders. These guys were world class-very engaging dudes, in a good mood--super friendly and quick. I didn't drink but my partner did and he had a fantastic time. He's also a bartender so he was very happy to receive top notch service from a staff that clearly knew what they were doing.  If I could give ten stars I would!  I was surprised to see only 4 stars as an average and i don't think that is representative of the establishment!    We will be back",

    "text": "HERBS & RYE. One of my go-to places for steak. It is always so, so good. Whenever my boyfriend and I have out-of-town guests, we take them here for the half-off happy hour specials. The midnight to 3AM happy hour is usually pretty busy. We've eaten here on countless occasions and it is always almost fully packed. So, the music and atmosphere are pretty loud. But, it's fine because we're too busy devouring our steaks to talk all that much.   We typically order the Filet Mignon. It is always perfect. If I am feeling it, I will order their sauces - either the chimichurri or brandy peppercorn sauce. Both are very good. The sides are for sharing. One side could probably be shared among 2-3 people. We usually order the mac-n-cheese, spinach, and asparagus.   If we are really hungry, we order the Tomato Bisque and/or Farmer Flatbread along with our steaks. The flatbread is pretty good. The egg on it really makes all the difference. The tomato soup comes with grilled cheese and is actually enough for an entire meal. So, if you're not that hungry but still want to eat along with your friends, order the tomato soup.   The drinks. My second favorite part. This place definitely does their drinks right. They have drinks featured from different time eras. The drinks are strong and presented very nicely. The beer selection is also pretty good.   Service is always on-par. They are attentive and have never had a problem in the countless times we've been here.   Overall, this place is awesome. I highly recommend. Will be back here again and again.",

Happy hour steak pricing is freaking incredible for the amount and quality of food that you get. If you have a bit of a sweet tooth or like the sweet/savory mix, definitely get the sweet potato tots and spring for the marshmallow crust. Phenomenal. We both got the ribeye and it's a hefty piece of meat. Plus the side you get, it's a great value for the money during happy hour.   The vibe in the place is awesome. It can get a bit bar noisy, but it's part bar and it's Vegas. It didn't disturb our experience because we were too focused on how delicious everything was. It is a bit dark in there but, again, nothing work knocking a star off for. This is a gem and worth the slight detour from the strip.",

That means REALLY crowded in the bar area, and on any given night there is a 45min+ wait, so go make a reservation on their website. Bar seating is first come, first serve. Bar area is also super loud, so if you are on a proper date, definitely reserve a table.   Great happy hour that is mostly steaks (50% off so ~$20-40) and a few seafood dishes. Get the spicy mussels appetizer (reg $26ish so HH is ~$13)- its my favorite dish and I always ask for some extra bread to sop up the delicious sauce. Well drinks are $6 during HH. Place is full of locals, especially industry people. Lots of tourists too though through word of mouth. and yelp?",

Reservations were made in advance for 8:30pm. We all arrived by 8:15pm. We were not seated until ~9:00pm. After we ordered, we waited around 40 minutes for the food to come out.  The food was just mediocre for its price. I shared the Pan Seared Salmon and Penne Pasta with Chicken. The Salmon was okay but the spinach, leek and sauce were a little too salty to taste. The Penne was good but it got to be very heavy after a few bites. I, personally, got a little full from the complimentary bread they gave since we waited a while...  I didn't try any of their cocktails, but they have an extensive menu. Their interior has dim lighting, and is a bit cramped around the bar area and entrance.  I find this place is probably better suited for smaller groups.",

We were lucky enough to be served by the only female mixologist, Emily & she's the bomb!  When we were in New Orleans we found out that Herbs & Rye consistently wins the annual cocktail competitions & they are so modest about it.  Emily was wearing her mixology pin award on her vest.  They also dress to impress - very professional & passionate about their craft.  Our friend asked for Campari & Emily suggested a better brand for her to try & it beat out Campari.  Another Italian Brand pictures here...",

Their cocktail list ranges through the eras of the history of the cocktail, so there is definitely something different and fun for everyone. I also love that they use fresh ingredients with an abundance of fruit adorning the bar.   We came in for a quick, quality, craft cocktail and weren't disappointed. We tried the Aviation and Boulevardier. Both very well done.   It's been a while since I've been in for food, but last I was here we had half-off steak that was excellent. Come for the full experience or just a drink. It'll be worth your while.",

I've ordered the framboise multiple times and the bill always reflects a higher price than the menu price so watch for that.

It's a small-ish place. There's a long bar and then several booths and tables, divided into a couple of different areas. The bartenders are very friendly and attentive - and really into their craft of cocktail making. During the week, they don't open until 5:00pm. And by 5:00pm, it's more like 5:10pm. Happy hour runs from 5:00pm-8:00pm. And the cocktails are well-made and delicious - and interesting and unique too.",

The vibe is speak easy swanky 20'sans 30's theme with dim lights, cool hip music and a bar to die for. The drinks definitely have bigger placement on the menu however the food is simple and amazing.   We started off with a Mary Pinkerton (drink) which was fruity and frothy. It opened up my taste buds for an amazing flat bread covered with sausage. The flat bread was great with the perfect amount of seasoning. I had the Kansas City bone in for dinner with the truffle Mac and cheese. My steak was accompanied by the house rub which was almost like an ancho chili paste spice rub. It was delightful and my steak was cooked to perfection. The Mac and cheese was good but lacked some seasoning. My dinner party ordered the strip steak and asparagus, jalapeno creamed corn and sweet potato Tots, all of which were enjoyable.   Dessert was THE BEST PART!  The donuts were absurdly perfect! Covered in sugar with a soft chewy dough! I of course covered mine in chocolate ganache! Yum!!  Creme brulee was creamy and rich!  The warm cookie was great for sharing with three scoops of rich vanilla ice cream! You couldn't beat it!   We will definitely go back. It's a great off the strip joint to being visitors who want a old school taste of Vegas!",

The big issue here is that I made numerous attempts to speak with the restaurant manager who has refused to communicate with me.   I'm talking about $35 but it still shows a lack of customer service and respect. Think about that the next time you are trying to decide what steak house to visit while you are in Vegas.",

Our server was really helpful explaining the menu since it was our first time eating here.  He's name is Vega and I think you'll recognize him just by his voice since it sounded like my drill instructor voice in bootcamp.  We ordered the steak, calamari, and clam pasta.  The food was pretty good, specially the steak.  The serving is pretty huge but my wife was able to finish the steak because it was that good.  The drinks tho it was the BOMB,I suggest getting the \"Jungle Bird\" this drink is no longer in the menu, if I wasn't driving the next day I would've ordered more.. I suggest you all go during happy hour and make a reservation because we got lucky we were seated right away without making reservation. We definitely coming back again and trying out their other drinks and steaks.",

Then someone walked out so we went in. It was a smaller place from what I could see, but we never made it all the way in. We checked in at the hostess stand for our reservation and were seated immediately in the room to the right at the first table so that's as far in as we went. I had to take away a star because this is a True steakhouse, not a lot of opinions for a vegetarian. I went here on a recommendation from my friend that lives in Vegas and my husband is not a vegetarian so it was fine. My husband was a waiter at a very well known steakhouse where we live and he said the steak he had  at Herbs & Rye was perfectly seasoned and one of the better steaks he's ever had. He also had the truffle mac & cheese as a side and had really good things to say about that too. My margarita flat bread was excellent and I got a side of their garlic mashed potatoes and was very happy with both. The wait staff was amazing and friendly and I truly enjoyed our night out.",

I was quite excited to finally try this place out for happy hour and here is my experience. To start, you cannot make reservations for the late happy hour 12-3am online. Husband stopped in when he was in the area to get that squared away. We arrived and our waiter, Joaquin was very friendly and knowledgeable on all our drinks. Some of the drink suggestions were spot on, one or two were not.  Clover club was very light but a little bitter for my taste. The Vieu Carr'e was the crowning glory. Nice cognac taste with amazing fragrance to it. Very strong too! Excellent customer service; staff was on point with refilling drinks and checking on us. We ordered the spicy mussels and the clams, which are their only two appetizers on happy hour. Delicious! The spicy mussels were a huge hit at the table, with the sauce making it the most delicious plate we ordered. Definitely recommend dipping that bread in the sauce. I ordered the filet mignon with truffle Mack and cheese. Mac and cheese was on point! Great flavor little crunch bits in top made for excellent texture. Thoroughly disappointed in the steak. Asked for the steak medium well and while the inside was so tender and delicious, the outer coating was burnt and extremely salty. The saltiness took away from what would have been the most delicious steak of my life. Buddy of mine had the same experience with his NY strip steak, so he didn't even get halfway through his meal. My husbands was excellent, right amount of seasonings really made his cut of beef shine. With a cut of meat this good, why add so many seasonings? It's already delicious! Little salt and pepper and it's good. So, I knocked off a star for that. One drink waiter suggested, Can't remember the name but it looked something like a red martini, was so bitter I nearly vomited my food. The doughnuts were certainly delicious. Would give this place another shot, if simply for the spicy mussels. Oh, and the table also ordered the meatballs with chorizo, tender meatball but very flat flavor. The whiskey potatoes were a delicious side as well.",

This restaurant is incredible and we love the happy hour there. We shared a 16oz ribeye cooked to perfection the truffle steak fries with bacon, French onion soup and a ceaser salad, all were excellent.  The bar is very good as well and you can eat at the bar as well as having a table. Great crowd wonderful staff and excellent food and service. We will be back!",

    "text": "So I had high hopes for this place based on my friend's experiences, unfortunately I had a horrible experience. First thing we had reservations and got our table right a away, so 1 star for that. Fyi, we were the only ones in the dining room when we got there at 6pm on a Monday. Our waiter was excellent  and attentive, so that's my 2nd star. But on to the good stuff. We were not offered bread service, but others had it, maybe we had to ask? Others had it. Anyways, not sure. It was happy hour when we went so that meant 1/2 off some drinks, appetizers and steaks. We had the clams as appetizers, they were nice. I also had the wedge salad and they had no bacon. But did they tell me before I ordered? Nope. Who runs out of bacon? Are there not like 400 stores around to go buy some? Anyways, we decided on the kitchen sink stew (my husband asked to try some before but they said no.) and the 14oz New York steak. We also had 2 sides, the button mushrooms and the asparagus. The steak was great, cooked perfectly, the sides were ok,nothing special. My kitchen sink stew was overly spicy and there was tiny pieces of shell in it that basically gave me an anxiety attack while eating what I could as I was freaking out there was a shell I wasn't seeing. Even the waiter noticed there were small pieces in it. Overall a crappy experience, and one not worth repeating.  PS, wow Herbs & Rye, judgey about what I look like? Shame on you!",

May I suggest the creamy truffle mac n cheese and to polish off your steak dinner, have the warm melt in your mouth, freshly made sugar donuts with the yummy caramel and the delectable vanilla dipping sauce!! Oh my, my!!! :D   On a side note: Parking can be a challenge during peak hours, due to small lot. Minus one star...",

    "text": "An off the strip (but not too far) local gem! ...You're welcome.  I am torn about writing a review for Herbs and Rye...I kind of want to keep it off of the radar and keep this little gem all to myself. However, the experience was beyond awesome not to give a huge cheers to the: ambiance, mixologists (bartenders), and food. Herbs and Rye is everything you want in a dark and sexy bar in a location that you don't want it in..which totally adds to its appeal and allure. (Thank the parking-lot gods, parking was easy breezy). The ambiance is on point from the dimly lit bar and smartly dressed staff. I'm a sucker for period, artsy, glam, & gothic noir and this fits the bill.  I sat at the bar and ordered my traditional rye-whiskey and ginger beer. However, I took plenty of time to let the drink menu school me in the ways & ages of alcohol:  Gothic, Golden, Old School, Prohibition, Rat Pack, & Revival!!! The bartenders at Herbs and Rye are mixologists and know the ways of spirits.  Soooo, I've been around for some 30'ish years and I will go on record saying the tomato bisque soup is the best I've ever had...It's paired with an over the top delicious gourmet grilled cheese sandwich...So DON'T order the amazing yummy flat bread as a side like I did because I didn't read the menu far enough to see the grilled cheese. Ha! Beyond satiated!!! If I didn't live in Portland Oregon this would be 'my spot'.  I will absolutely be back the next time I visit Vegas.  Do come hungry  Do come thirsty Do make a reservation for the restaurant  Do ask the bartenders to make you a 'surprise' drink if you don't know what you want Don't drink and drive. If you do drive parking lot is available, do have a designated driver.  Do take a cab/uber...and believe me leaving sober isn't really on the menu  Don't be alarmed by the co-ed bathrooms but do lock the doors, all of them.",

    "text": "The girlfriend and I went for dinner and drinks at Herbs & Rye on our last night in Vegas upon the recommendation of many of the local bartenders we had encountered during our stay.  It's been our experience that the word of a local bartender especially in Vegas is one to be trusted and this was no exception.  Herbs & Rye is off the Strip and definitely not a stop for most tourists.  It occupies a fairly non-descript block building on W. Sahara, well marked with signage announcing its presence.  Stepping inside is like stepping into a time machine to an Italian steakhouse 30-40 years ago.  I liked it for its laid-back charm and unpretentiousness.  Still, we weren't there to appreciate the architectural and interior design.  We came to eat and drink...not necessarily in that order.  We started off with some cocktails and apps.  Herbs & Rye's cocktail list reads like the comprehensive history of American cocktails.  Even if you're not having drinks, the cocktail list is worth a read if only for educational purposes.   I had the classic Lion's Tail ($9) made with bourbon, lime juice, pimento dram, simple syrup, and Angostura bitters.  It was a well-made, tasty drink notable for the allspice notes from the pimento dram.  We shared an order of the fried calamari ($15).  It was nicely fried leaving the calamari tender (as fried calamari can be).  It was a bit overpriced by $3-4 considering the portion size received.  For my dinner, I had the New York Strip with a side of Truffle Mac & Cheese ($34).  It wasn't a dry-aged prime cut of beef nor was it wagyu, but my steak was cooked to my requested medium rare, juicy and tender enough.  The Truffle Mac & Cheese was cheesy and imbued with plenty of truffle flavor.  In fact, it was to the point of straddling the line of too much truffle essence, as it was the dominant flavor practically overwhelming the cheese.  Service was plus.  Josh, our server, was personable and attentive throughout our meal.  From its generic exterior to its dated circa 1960s/70s interior, Herbs & Rye's anti-Strip look and feel belies its True nature.  Herbs & Rye is a first-rate cocktail joint with its outstanding craft cocktails that are well executed and reasonably priced.  The food is satisfying, if a bit unremarkable, and doesn't shine nearly as bright as the cocktails.  That said, I still left fat, dumb, and happy!  I'll gladly return for drinks the next time I'm in town!  3 stars for the food...4 stars for the drinks.  3.5 stars overall.",

We decided to try something different and after a bit of research picked Herbs and Rye.  We had 5:30 reservations and were advised to not be late - take head, they got very busy!!!!  This is the coolest place.  The atmosphere and vibe were so much fun.  The music was awesome. Leaves you feeling like Al Pacino or Robert Di Niro are going to come strolling in.   the food - best we've had in Vegas.  If you get there between 5-8 p.m. it is happy hour, which means all of their steaks are half off.  Our table had a variety of appetizers, steaks, sides, and the spicy mussels.   Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food.  One person had their filet prepared Pittsburgh rare - he said that was the best he's ever had at a restaurant.   Our wait staff was amazing.  Even with how busy they were we never felt rushed. They were spot on the entire evening.   Their cocktail menu can be a little overwhelming- but the waiter was very versed and could easily point us in the right direction.  It's probably the coolest cocktail menu I've ever come across, broken up by era instead of type of liquor- so like \"Rat Pack\" selections or \"Prohibition\" where the cocktails in each category were those you would have found in those times.  We've already decided we'll be back here next year.  And might even find time to sneak back this year!!!!  Hats off to a great local team.",

Unfortunately, it took us asking and approximately 15 minutes for our drink order to be placed. By 530 we still did not have drinks and had to ask to go ahead and place our food order.  Our food was fantastic as always once we got it. Normally we have had great service but this time it was lacking. I will continue to come here because we love the food and happy hour pricing, however we were disappointed in the service on this visit.",

As a broke college student, finding cheap/decent eats is like a diamond in the rough and I'd definitely say herbs & rye is.   EVERY night from 5pm-8pm and 12am-close? The happy hour is 1/2 off some of the steak items (among other items on the menu) and the steak is good quality and awesome.   This is one of the places you don't even need to drench your steak in A1 sauce-- because it is just that good.   I was told that they cut their meat portions in-house, and lemme tell ya- the portions are pretty decent. You can get a 20 oz ribeye for 22 bucks!! The steaks also come with delicious sides and I recommend getting the truffle mac and cheese. It is served fresh and the combination of the two are extremely satisfying.

    "text": "Very disappointed  in our visit last night.  The drinks were lesser quality, made by bartenders I didnt recognize from prior visits to Herbs & Rye.  My group had 11 cocktails  and 9 were just slightly off making the drink a little harsh to swallow.  We are cocktail  people and travel to places like tails of the cocktail  in new orleans for cocktails and this was the worst sazerac I've ever had.  My group of 4 agreed that the drinks were  not up to our expectations of a Herbs and Rye cocktail.   Secondly, the steaks were filled with fat and 1 with way too much gristle. We had amazing steaks in our past visits  to Herbs and Rye and this visits quality was very disappointing for our whole group. I known that ribeyes are marbled with fat but this was excessive.   Don't believe gristle about the size of a tennis ball should be found in the middle of a New York steak. Third, we all were so disappointed to walk in and hear Michael Jackson,  stevie wonder and other 70's soul R & B being played.  We are use to the electro swing, jazzy lounge style of music they played all other times we have been there. Herbs & Rye has a great lounge feel / atmosphere. Playing the wrong style of music for its decor didn't make sense and to not hear the great lounge swing style of music was disappointing. It altered the feel of this great restaurant and bar.  After about $300, we had to sadly leave.  We ended up finishing the night at a different cocktail bar. We were very disappointed and discussed  our sadness over cocktails later that night and over breakfast the next day.  I sure hope management won't ruin this amazing place.  We recommend  it to everyone that will listen and after last night, I'm afraid to recommend it. Last night was 3/5 @ best All past visits 5/5.    WILL BE BACK AGAIN BUT hoping our favorite bar just had a bad night.  The music COMPLETELY changed the vibe of this lounge for the worse!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for YEARS!!!! Always an amazing time! Food is always ridiculously tasty! & needless to say is my favorite bartender & makes the most amazing drinks... (Brown Derby, is My to go too!) ...anyhow, Last night was my last official night living in Vegas & so of course, I wanted to visit & spend time at my three favorite places, oak & Ivy, Downtown Cocktail Room & end it with some delicious late-night food and drink & Herbs & Rye. Now, again. I've been coming for years!!! & last night I was wrongly, verbally attacked by the black waiter/bar tender, Joe. I was already in my zone, feeling fun, flirty & tipsy & made a silly girl joke about I can't even remember what... & He completely over reacted!!! He was being so rude & obnoxious and sarcastic that I decided to ask for another waiter.. he sees me talking to his manager (lovely Burnett girl) & in front of her proceeds to yell at me, asked me to leave \"his bar\", told me I was \"taking money out of the owners wallet\"...& just made a huge ordeal out of nothing, literally through a bitch tantrum in front of management. Made me tear up, because it was my last night in Vegas & I was at one of my favorite places (to which I'm a regular too) & being treated like absolute dirt!! His behavior was completely uncalled for & utterly embarrassing!! I did nothing to deserve that! The manager was sweet and apologized and gave me a different waitress & EVEN STILL, he continued to hover over our table (that was located near the bar) ask my friends questions directed towards me. Again, completely rude and embarrassing and immature AF!!! He asked.. \"Will you ask her if she'd like water\"..!? Like... excuse me!? NOOOO I ALREADY ASKED FOR ANOTHER WAITRESS BECAUSE OF YOUR Ridiculous ANTICS & So can't you please leave us be...!!? I told him he was  insanely rude and I was surprised by his behavior & don't need or want to talk to you! He would just not let it go!!! His manager had to come back over a second time to address the situation again (his attitude) & told him to Leave Our Table Alone!  5-6  years I've been coming to this place and never, have I ever had a bad thing to say about Herbs & Rye.. I've brought hundreds of first timers to this restaurant/bar! I frequently come there on my own and sit at the bar...  The bartender was just having a bad night, on some weird power trip & I was the one he decided to take it out on.. NOT COOL!!! Joe (pretty sure That's his name) should be fired. He dose not deserve to work with some of the best bar tenders in Las Vegas. I was truly disgusted by his behavior... shame on you.",

We went for our anniversary. Although it's a bit dark and moderate noise the food and service were amazing! Our waiter Charlie was helpful and fun with awesome recommendations for drinks and food. Their happy hour starts at 5-8 and all steaks are 1/2 off as well as drinks, some pasta dishes and a few apps. We had the calamari for an app. OMG with amazing aioli, banana peppers and prosciutto it was the bomb and a huge order that we could not finish (although hubby tried). We then had steaks cooked to perfection with truffle Mac an cheese and garlic mash. Mmmmmm. He complimentary dessert was amazing, and it was just glazed donuts! My drink was also amazing but can't remember the name, but Charlie said his favorite! We left in a food coma, after a complimentary shot of brandy to soothe the stomach. We will definitely be back on our next trip!",

    "text": "It had been about a year and a half since I last saw her, but she came blazing back into my life on my holiday trip to Vegas. Without much debate, it was agreed that we would spend Christmas day out in the desert to celebrate our happy reunion. I felt the winter desert chill under my jacket as the sun began its daily journey below the horizon. And she, dressed in green, looked as beautiful as the last time I saw her. She had not changed one bit, still living life like it would burn out within the span of a half hour's time. Like always, she stormed back into my life and took over, burning my lips with her kiss and devastating my emotions with her words. In her presence, every fleeting thought escaped into a rabbit hole into which I felt compelled to pursue with singular obsession and undivided attention. Why was the desert so brown? Why was this road that we were on so long and windy? And what the hell did I do with my meager existence in the years 2002 and 2003? Time slowed and every possible outcome which could result from our actions became all the more manifestable.  An entire day spent with her left me drained and unable - or unwilling - to move an inch when I finally went back to the hotel. After a very restful slumber, I awoke in the morning and decided that one day was enough. I could not be with her again for my last day in Vegas. She left in me a need of recovery and triggered an unexpected feeling of homesickness. During dinner that next day, I noticed a book that the bartender had at the bar titled simply \"PDT\". Upon inquiry, I found that it was indeed a reference to the bar in East Village. The bartender said he loved the drinks in the book and I asked if there were any place like that in Vegas. He lamented that sadly there aren't any, but there was a particular bar-restaurant which made prohibition-era and classic cocktails. What better way to quench my homesickness? Off to Herbs and Rye I went.  Herbs and Rye was not located on the Strip, and it was definitely not within walking distance from the Strip, guaranteeing an establishment that wasn't inundated with tourists. It was the night after Christmas day, and the restaurant didn't have many customers. A lone waitress and the owner-bartender staffed the place. The mood was relaxing and and the lighting dim. I skipped the food menu and flipped to the drinks. Customers can easily tell that the owner was passionate about classic cocktails from what was offered on the drink menu. The drinks were divided into eras in which the drinks were popularised, including descriptions of the eras and history of each drink. Made with absinthe, of course I first had to order a Sazerac. Each sip of this clutched at my throat deliciously herbal and bitter. Next I ordered a Brown Derby, which I've never had before. Who knew honey and grapefruit could go so well together? With the bourbon, it made for a full-bodied drink with contrasting flavours. I must profess I liked the Brown Derby more. While I drank, I made conversations with the friendly owner about drinks and food.  Herbs and Rye is definitely a restaurant I will be visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas, and I recommend it highly. My only regret was that the drinks, while delicious, were not made strong enough for my taste.",

Coming from NYC the atmosphere made me feel like home. Came here twice, once on a date with the hubby & celebrated his birthday with family and friends. The husband previously came here for a birthday party with his LeReve performer friends and could not wait to take me here. We enjoyed our time and will definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for a chill spot with delicious food. Despite what others in our party had said in their tacky Yelp review (party of 2 which the step father was spiteful & using his wives account to place a negative review due to his personal issues), EVERYONE enjoyed themselves including the birthday boy, our pescatarian family, out of state family and friends. Nectaly is amazing and we will definitely return with friends. Keep up the good work guys!",

The place is pretty awesome, like from the prohibition days. Drinks are priced around $10-15 for their specialty drinks. We had steaks, steaks were delicious and the bread and butter were amazing. For dessert we had the donuts... those was delicious!  I gave it 1 less star because we had reservations for 7:30 and we showed up 15 mins till. They werent ready to seat us so we decided to wait at the bar. When going to the bar we noticed multiple spaces open and asked if we could sit there. They said no you must will till 7:30pm. So we waited at the bar. Next to the bar we noticed some seats that had signs saying they were reserved. 7:30pm comes around and waitress goes to seat us.. sure enough its at the spots that said reserved! Why couldnt they seat us prior? So inconvenient. But at least the food made up for the poor first impression.",

Like I said before, it's a perfect place for date night. Dimly lit and the decor is pretty cool. Every time I've gone the service has always been excellent, bartenders to servers, everyone is really gracious and polite.   Ok so, the drinks, yeeeah, they're pretty expensive, but! They're made well and they offer a lot of unique choices so, you really do get what you pay for, in my humble opinion. If you have savvy sophisticated drinkers in your life, this is definitely a spot to take them to. Oh, and let's talk about their food menu.  Holy hell, they have really amazing food here. I haven't been disappointed yet. Try the flat bread pizzas. They are scrumptious.   So yeah, it's an intimate type of place so definitely come here with your significant other and get bonus points for picking such an awesome place to eat.",

The cocktails are all classics from different eras.  I had a bad day and needed some bourbon stat, Herbs and Rye had my medicine.  I had three seperate cocktails, all with bourbon, all delicious.  I would say the sazerac had a bit too much absinthe in it for me, but other than that it was all delicious.  The bartenders were good, knowledgeable and friendly.  We shared a wedge salad, better than most and a flatbread with prociutto and asparagus on it.  It was good, not phenomenal, but good.    I need to go back during happy hour and eat and drink more!",

Let me tell you a floor guy from the Rio told me about this place, he said \"the best steak i have ever had its a locals spot\" i said that's a tall statement and i went.  First of all i called asked if i needed a reservation they said know how many people are in your party i said about 7 or 8 then we showed up maybe half our later and they had our table ready, i was a little shocked because it seemed to be a little hole in the wall place (which i like) but unlike the normal Vegas experience. The Decor and atmosphere was very welcoming and honestly reminded me of many nice places in Portland, then we were seated they played jazzy electro house , underground old school hip hop instrumentals HA i heard a MOB DEEP instrumental which i was shocked but i loved it and people seemed to love it,  this again reminded me so much of Portland because we can get away with it, I don't see other city's and places doing this especially if its a fancy dining! The Waitress was very friendly and so was all the staff, i ordered the NY steak and garlic mash , i am very picky about my steaks and it was AMAZING it was cooked to perfection, everyone else enjoyed there food and was completely satisfied!  Food, and drinks aside the biggest thing i loved was we had FUN, its was not like your normally fancy dining experience in Vegas i agree with the other reviews this IS a hidden GEM!   this place is a MUST go every time i go to Vegas from here on out!",

From the warm greeting at the door, to the great appetizers and flat-bread and the old time cocktails, this place is a wonderful place to spend a few hours.   We are not the typical guests here, since we are mid to late 50's and aren't employed in the industry here in town, but we still felt welcomed and enjoyed the cozy, comfy atmosphere that is Herbs & Rye.  There is no doubt it's more of a hipster joint, than a vintage Vegas place, but other than a DJ playing the current hits, you'd have thought you'd have entered a time warp with the old school cocktails.   It's cool to see a fully stocked bar with a copper black splash and an Absinthe fountain.  The drinks were from another era.  Old recipes going back to the early late 1800's to the early 20th Century.    We had the meatballs and though they were commercially prepared they were quite tasty as was the flat-bread pizza that we shared.  Overall a real hit and a nice way to share some good food, pleasant atmosphere and some old time specialties.",

(Manager from herbs and rye) I'm confused that you would charge for rocks on one drink and not the other. This place will nickel and dime you for the drinks you order there.",

We walked in with no reservations during happy hour and was seated in 15 minutes. I wouldn't recommend doing that because they were jammed packed but we really lucked out. I had the ribeye and hubby had the New York strip. Both were outstanding!! Can't beat the price of half off steaks during happy hour. The staff was exceptional. We will definitely be back when we come to a Vegas!!",

The whiskey potatoes, macaroni and cheese, jalapeno creamed corn and the sweet potato tots with the marshmallow topping were all just to die for!  Easily one of my new favorite restaurants!

I wish the food was better as I think it could become a Las Vegas favorite for me if it was better.   I was there with a small party of friends, one of which is a local and made the referral so we were pretty excited. The food overall was decent quality, but just seemed bland and under-seasoned. I had the pork chop and truffeled garlic parmesan fries (a favorite of mine from other places) and they were a let down. They didn't have much flavor and seemed pretty ordinary. I tasted the steak of one of my friends and it was the same.   Because the ambiance, service and place are pretty cool, I will probably try it again and update my review if necessary.",

I'm so upset that I can't visit this place more often because I don't live in Vegas. The food was so good that the 3 people dry humping at the bar right next to us was barely memorable. Let's be real, how can you not remember something like that; it was disturbing. However, that's a funny tidbit but not a reflection of the restaurant itself. I guess Vegas brings out the skank in everyone.  It was crazy busy. We had reservations and still had to wait for 30 min, which was not a problem at all for us. The server we had was so great Ronnie was his name and he was beyond overworked. My fiance is a server and neither of us could figure out if he was the only one working there or what. Even with his assistant the dude was super slammed. Nevertheless the food again was incredible.",

I maybe got 4-5 sips out of it, with luck. I told the waiter, who essentially made up a BS story of why they do it like that, when we all know the reality of why they do. I did not like that. Which is a pity, because I was really looking forward to this place, that was supposedly one of the best in Vegas. Not coming back.

Don't let the outside scare you, it looks kind of dive-y but the inside is decorated very classic old school steakhouse-like!   The happy hour is THE BEST, down right BEST in town. The serve the highest grade premium quality steak cuts at 50% off during happy hour; 5-8pm and 12-close. Appetizers are also discounted.  The bar is big and spacious where you can actually have a meal. Bar seats are first come first serve.   For appetizers, my personal favorite is the spicy mussels. The sauce is so good I can drink it!   There are \"rubs\" for steaks, I've only tried the Herbs and Rye House rub. It makes the meat so good. While I think the steak plain w/o the rub isn't as good compared to the many other steak houses in the city, but the rub makes it stand out. Steaks also come with a side; I've had the spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, mac n cheese, and garlic mash. All of which are good, but not to die for.   I've never had enough room in my tummy for desserts! The happy hour full size portions at half price really fills you up!   They also have an extensive cocktail menu, all of which are classic and unique to their own. I'm not a cocktail person, everything is sour to me so I stick with my wine. They have the Miller high life beer- \"The Champagne of Beer\" which you don't see often.  I suggest you to make a reservation if you come during HH hours. It gets really packed and the wait time is not short!  It's not too far off the strip, it's worth the drive/uber.",

Some of the best cocktails I've had. Sazerac is my go to and they never fail!   Let's talk about the food tho..... holy sh*t those mussels in that spicy red sauce and that bread to dip!! It's a must for me and you should try it too.   The steaks seal the deal. That grilled taste and a nice medium rare temp. You don't need no sauce just a pinch of sea salt! One day I will order one of those monsters.   Mark our server was cool af he will treat you well and make sure you always have a drink in your hand and bread to go with your mussels haha",

    "text": "Upon arriving here we were taken back by the rough exterior. But as I read with previous Yelpers reviews, I knew what to expect. But once you walk inside... Wow the decor and ambiance was pretty cool. I loved the feel of the place. Walking in was like a completely different place than the outside.  Me & the beau seated at the bar to wait for our friends. I ordered a Moscow Mule & he got a Pisco Sour. My Moscow Mule was so good, I just didn't like how it was filled with ice so I basically paid for a cup full of ice, I woulda liked more drink for my buck. Pisco sour had egg white in it so it basically just tasted like foam, honestly. I then ordered a Pimms Cup. Oh how I loved that drink! & had cucumber chunks in it! So delicious! My recommendation for a drink if you go here.   Our friends started to come so we got a table. We were waiting for the clock to strike 12am so we can take advantage of their infamous happy hour! I ordered a Kansas Bone In w/ that extra spicy rub with Truffle Mac n Cheese as my side! OMG to die for! That rub on the steak had little flavor fairies dancing in my mouth! My friend ordered the Penne Pasta. That was also extremely good, not part of their happy hour though. The beau ordered chicken wings and everyone thought they were so good, but I think they tasted like chicken wings! Lol.  \\_()_/    What really stood out to me was our waiter, Christian. He was extremely delightful, making suggestions for which cocktails we would like. One of my friends got what he has suggested & didn't like it and Christian brought him another drink for free! Also towards the end he brought us out some bomb sugar donuts with 2 mouth watering dipping sauces, also on the house! How sweet of him.   Overall I loved this place.. I'll probably be returning very soon!",

We came for happy hour and arrived just before 5:00 with a little line out front but we were promptly seated, there was plenty of room left after we got seated though as the bar seats got taken first (but you can still order happy hour from a table).  Joaquin was our server and was very accommodating and patient and ran through the whole menu for us. Ordered an old fashioned and another rye based drink based on his reco and both were excellent. I ordered the ribeye, which was very good, but my wife ordered the filet which literally melted in your mouth, minimal chewing required.  It's 9 oz, which was ambitious for her, but she finished all of it, which never happens. The jalapeno cream corn was very good as well as unique - not spicy but a good jalapeno flavor. Truffle Mac n cheese was also quite good. The atmosphere, as good as the food was, was what put it over the top. You feel like you're in a speak easy almost with the dim lighting and decor.  The music was on point to.  Also shout out to the bust staff, any empty glass/plate was promptly removed from the table. We were visiting from out of town But definitely will make a point to come back!",

Aside from the unbeatable happy hour deal 5-8, the food was excellent and the atmosphere had a fantastic vibe. We ordered the Ribeye, jalapeno creamed corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. They offer the special rub which we passed on because everyone knows that if the steak needs a rub or a dip, then it's not a very good steak. We were pleasantly surprised; the steak was excellent just as is. The music playlist makes you not want to leave the bar and sing along hugging the people sitting beside you. Our bartender/server Matt, was knowledgeable, personable, and efficient. The staff as well as the patrons were incredibly friendly. Not like this place needs any yelp reviews but I highly recommend this place to locals and visitors alike.",

Thanks to my yelp buddy Schel X for the tip, we came on a friday night for dinner and to take advantage of the half off steak deal. Actually, there are also 2 appetizers that are half off as well as all the steaks which all comes with one side.   We got here at 6:30p and the restaurant had a few empty tables and no line of people waiting. However, the hostess told us that there's a 30min wait with no reservation. Huh? So we found a seat at the bar which was very uncomfortable for me. 5 mins after we were seated the hostess came and asked us if we wanted a table. Why didn't she offer us a table earlier before we placed our order? Lame.  Our food also took a long time to come out, which didn't make sense because the restaurant was not busy. Drinks were $11 each, and very mediocre. We ordered 2 appetizers: garlic clams were pretty good, but the bacon calamari was the bomb! After that, I got my Kansas City bone-in with a side of brussel sprouts. Loved it! The sprouts were caramelized and stir fried with chucks of fatty swine - delicious!   Clean bathrooms and cool 1920's decor and music, dim lighting. Parking is a major pain we had to park far and walk as there's not enough spots around the restaurant.",

    "text": "I ate here last night for the first time. I had heard from other locals that this was the place to go. I was excited to try it out. We booked an 8pm reservation, but I hear happy hour is the time to go, however after last night I wouldn't go back at all.   We weren't able to find parking so we had to walk about a block after circling for some time. The sign on the outside said they have gaming, but that is False if you are looking to do it. It's just an old sign they like to keep out as part of their original establishment.   We were seated very close to our reservation time, that was great. Our kind server did a nice job of being personable and caring throughout the entire night so that was also a bonus.   However, after ordering what I thought would be a nice meal and certainly should have been for the price, I would have rather gone to Outback Steakhouse for a better meal than this place (and saved a bunch more). My partner and I both ordered the same thing. Surf and Turf. We had the filet and lobster. I ordered mine medium rare and his was medium. When the dishes came out, it was a simple but beautiful presentation. I was fooled. While my partners meat looked more medium to well done, mine was cooked even longer with zero pink left on the inside. I called our server over and she was apologetic, and only removed the meat saying it would be redone. At that point we both decided to try the lobster tails. Again... looks are very deceiving. There was absolutely no moisture left in that poor lobster at all. They cooked every once of life out of it, and then some. After waiting to find our server we advised her of the lobster failure as well. She said she would make this right and took both plates from us.   Really she did a nice job handling a poor situation, but then we had to wait for a re-make on the food, and wait, and wait, and wait some more. By the time the 2nd plate came out, we just wanted to eat and leave. I didn't expect dinner to take nearly as long as it had for two people. We watched tables around us, some with big parties come and go much faster than just the two of us.   Finally the check came, with not even as much as an apology for the meal that not only took forever, but wasn't even up to a decent standard. No manager came over to apologize either. No adjustment in the meal too so they left us paying full price for a meal that was less than great. Again.. save your money and go to the Outback. You will have a better more consistent meal.  I wanted to email them about the experience but they don't have that either. After waiting last night as long as we did, we just wanted to leave.",

Once inside, it is a very cute place. Like a dark, brooding speak easy.   We ordered drinks, our waiter was very nice . He did warn me the Mint Julep I ordered was a very strong drink....and wow! It was too strong for me, he was very nice and offered to get me something else.   We ordered the Kobe sliders...so juicy and flavorful! Also the carpaccio, perfection. Great meat and wonderful flavors. As well as the sweet potatoe tater tots with marshmallow crust...great idea, but fell a little short for me there wasn't enough salty contrast in the dish. We also ordered the farmers flat bread...ok, not wonderful.   I did really like the good food we had here though. Be warned, if you like semi-sweet cocktails like me...there isn't a whole lot on the menu that doesn't involve bitters, gin, rum, or whiskey.",

    "text": "It pains me to give the delicious food here such a low rating, but there are two reasons for it.  1. The prices. Without the Happy Hour, the prices here are ridiculous. You can go to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for these prices and get a far superior cut of meat for the same prices, if not less.  2. The service. Oye. We were a party of 7. Normally, I'm very forgiving of mistakes in a big party. Things are just bound to go wrong when you have that many people to serve. That wasn't the problem here. The problem was that we were in the restaurant for almost 2 hours and saw our waiter 4 times. Maybe 5. He came and took our orders, then he disappeared. 35 minutes later, we haven't received any of our food, and we haven't seen our waiter in 35 minutes. Several of us wanted to order another round of drinks and were stuck trying to waive someone down. No one ever came. Finally, he came with our food and we quickly ordered drinks while we had him. He disappeared again until he came around with our check.  The worst part is, the restaurant wasn't even crowded when we were there. I counted 7 or 8 other tables that were seated, that was about it. When you've got a big party and you know you're getting a mandatory tip, that shouldn't be grounds to just ignore the group and collect your cash at the end of the night. If there had been a manager going around asking how patrons were doing, we might have been able to point out our problem to him. But there wasn't. Guess bad service starts at the top and works its way down.  To be fair, the food itself was delicious, which is why I'm still not giving it 1 star. Everyone was happy with how everything came out and all the meat was cooked perfectly. The flavors here are fabulous.  It's a great spot for some yummy food, but I'd suggest never going in large parties or during regularly priced hours.",

    "text": "Why couldn't I have a great experience like everyone else? :(  I came here for a late dinner with 3 friends a few months ago.  Our waitress did not seem thrilled to be working in the least bit.  I ordered the sliders and asked for them plain.  \"So do you want the sauce?\"  \"No thank you.\"  Our drinks are all empty by the time our food comes out.  It is served by a different server, or a food runner.  Sure enough my sliders come out with sauce on them.  After the person drops off our food he leaves.  Clearly we all need refills.  Since it was so hard to find our waitress I decided to just suck it up and eat my sliders with the sauce on them.  After looking around, we finally see our waitress in a corner eating.  Umm okay, let's let her enjoy her food.. We flag down someone to get refills and a different person again later on to get our check.  Our waitress comes over to pick up our check and return it... What sucky service!!  The food was good, even with the sauce.  I will have to come back again and give this place a second shot.  Only because of the food.  However in restaurants, food and service go hand in hand.  Too often do I hear of places with great food losing customers because of crappy service.  Since I am a server myself, I will give her the benefit of the doubt and give it another go.",

    "text": "Following a rather busy Saturday, a small contingent of us managed to get a late dinner in.  I only heard good hollers about this joint so took a detour from the Commonwealth (still never been to yet) to give them a try since the couple we was with lives deep in Hendo.  From the outside, the place looks like a dive bar or possibly even strip club or swinger bar appearance, with no windows or accents other than a well lit sign.  There is parking around the building and the place can be found on the south side of Sahara.  Upon entrance, I immediately dug the atmosphere.  Very dim lighting for those scared of the dark, lol.  It is deceivingly spacious inside and well designed in several sections for dining and the more bustling bar area.    There was a pretty sick DJ in there spinning hits with the accompanying music videos to match.  Unfortunately, we were seated in a four person booth that was directly under on of the speaker monitors, making it extremely hard to communicate.  We resorted to sign language and drunken facial features before long.    There is a vast menu of custom cocktails and saison beers.  Nothing extravagant, but offers a little more than your mainstream domestics and imports.  They brew their own beer as well but went with Chimay (red label) and recommended it to my buddy who is not accustomed to Trappist beer.  The ladies went with some cocktail that was a bit sour for my taste and probably explains why I didn't get its name.    For dinner, there is two happy hours, one in the early evening and a reverse happy hour later at midnight.  All items with a star next to it are half off, considering some of the steaks range from average prices up to $160+.  My homie went with a New York steak, his lady the clam linguine, and I shared a medium rare rib eye with my girl.  Steaks are aged and grilled well.  Defiantly good cuts.  We got there about 11 and killed some time with the carpaccio, calamari and shrimp cocktail until happy hour hit.  Oh yeah the mac and cheese was on point as well.  Not nearly as good as DW Bistro though.  The decor is hip and trendy.  The bar was packed and this place seems to cater to a nice variety of heads.  A boat load of friends drove in from Cali on a whim and met over here before hitting up Spearmint Rhino for one of the girl's barfday.  It got a bit busier then and they were in the secluded section all on their own, and sadly, was not pleased with the waitresses neglect to them like some orphans with B.O.  (poor things).  The overall experience was great and can see ourselves coming by in the future, either to pre funk before a headliner venue, or just to get a late bite to eat.  The place is a hit and was highly recommended from my co dub and another couple.  Oh yeah, since the place is about rye's, don't forget to get the Sazerac...after a few, I dubbed it the commissioner sazerac (sic) instead of Sisolak...go figure.",

    "text": "After hearing great reviews about Herbs and Rye, I finally made it here for a Happy Hour and a double date on a Friday night. The place wasn't packed for a Friday, but that was fine by me. We were seated in the corner booth right away. The server came and explained to us what the happy hour items were. He left and didn't come back for another 15 minutes.....I asked him what drink would he recommend for me and he said the Clover Club. (Gin, Lemon, Egg White and Grenadine....something like that, I wasn't a big fan so he traded me for a lemondrop martini instead).   We ordered the Carpaccio, Spicy Mussels, Linguine and Clams and the Rib Eye with the Mac and Cheese. After the server put the order in, everything came out pretty quickly. The Spicy Mussels were really spicy...to spicy for this girl. The Carpaccio was yummy!!! I could probably eat that all night, but just a FYI it's not on the HH menu. I LOVE linguine and clams and I felt that Herbs and Rye did a good job, but it was too spicy for me. The fiance was not to happy with his steak as it was cold and tough to eat, so that was a disappointment. Overall, the food was good although I'm sure I had a stomachache from all the spiciness but it was worth it. For two drinks, two appetizers and two entrees for a total of 75 bucks, it's pretty reasonable. The Happy Hour menu is limited, but the linguine and clams was pretty delicious. We definitely will be back to try the flatbread.",

The other evening I enjoyed a 17 oz. bone-in ribeye and a side of jalapeno creamed corn...all for a delicious $13.00.  While it still makes for a good $26 entree (ordering this dish during non-happy hours gets you two sides instead of one), getting this for half price only sweetens the deal.  This is one of the better deals I've come across in a while.  Don't get dragged to a Station Casino looking for their late night steak and eggs;  this is the place to be!  The bartenders are the other stars here at Herbs and Rye.  They have been able to make all drinks that my friends and I have ordered without giving us a blank stare and asking, \"What is that?\"  This is a refreshing thing to see as compared to other establishments.  My friends have been very impressed by the drinks crafted here; I think they make good drinks, but nothing on their menu has really made my palate scream for more.  I'm perfectly happy ordering an Old Fashioned here, though, which I can't say about 90% of the other bars out there!  One nice thing that's happened recently is that all the video poker machines have been removed from the bar!  This makes for an even better place to grab a few drinks and a meal if your party is small enough to sit at the bar.  Nectaly has been a superb host, remembering customers and always asking customers how their experience has been.  Herbs and Rye is another repeat eat for me here in Las Vegas!",

I was apprehensive when we got here, I felt that any moment a slasher lurking between the cars  will be attacking you as it was so dark at the parking lot.  Once you get inside the restaurant, it was quite nice. Dark but beautiful interior. We were lucky to get seated at the back room area where it's quieter. We came before 8PM and some appetizers and steaks were half priced! Cool! We ordered the spicy mussels for appetizer and it was so delicious! The serving size was  good enough for  sharing for 2 people, the red sauce was so flavorful my hubby had to ask for extra bread for dipping and ate it with gusto! I had the filet mignon and hubby was partial to rib eye, both steaks were cooked to perfection.  No condiments needed. I like the sides of  button mushrooms and the truffle mac & cheese.  We were so full we did not have room for desserts.  Our server was nice and regularly checked on us.   I'm docking 1 star as service is a bit slow: the food took a while to come out;  the entrees were pricey (unless you come during happy hour), the background music were not conducive to a romantic date  (they were playing 70's song like Anita Ward's \"Ring My Bell\" when we were dining there! Ugh! )  and  the exterior is creepy - I think they should add more lights at the parking area for safety reasons. Other than these, I think it's worth coming back to. I'll try their cocktails and desserts next time.",

    "text": "I am sitting at Herbs and Rye, dumbfounded by the spectacular service.   It is my mom's birthday today and we figured we would try this place out. I heard my friends rave about the atmosphere and the food quality so we figured, why not?   Seating was quick although unfortunately it was in front of the bar. It would usually be okay if I were out with friends but if you're coming for an intimate night, between family or your significant other, be sure to call for a reservation and ask for a table in the backroom area. It'll surely help save your voice :P.   Back to the amazing service, we ordered the clams appetizer as a starter. It was a decent size but probably not good to share with more than 2 people. The sauce that came with it was WOW.   For the main course we opted to get the King Kong steak, a gargantuan steak weighing in at 60 oz (that's 3.75 lbs!!!!!) along with a delicious side of mushrooms and Truffle Mac & Cheese (MUST HAVE).   The steak came out cold at first so we asked the waitress if we could get it warmed up for a bit. Out steak was taken away and we were promised to get our steak back nice and warm but something more impressive occurred. The manager came over to our table and told us he felt it was unacceptable that our meat was cold so he told us they were in the process of making a steak that would come fresh out the grill and straight to us. When the steak came out it was better than the first bites we first took with our other steak and we were all pleased.   The professionalism that the manager and the waitress demonstrated was beyond our expectations.   Will we come back? HECK YES! Any restaurant that is committed to having customers leave happy is a restaurant worth revisiting.   Tip: Come from 5 pm to 8 pm to enjoy half priced drinks and some STEAK (amazing, right?)",

The food is wonderful. Their cocktail menu is unique and the cocktails are delicious; plus the bartenders area a blast. The service otherwise has been very bad, hence the 3 stars. The hostess was incredibly rude to me the one time I didn't sit at the bar and requested a table. She couldn't be bothered to do her job and had a very poor attitude. Then she completely forgot about us and we waited 45 minutes prior to finding out she forgot about putting us at a table. Another time our server at our table was rude; several of us waited 25 minutes to even get asked if we wanted a drink and never got to order food or a second cocktail despite being there for an hour and a half! The server didn't attend to us at all and was very rudea, he slammed down our stuff at the table and we impatient and huffy. I was shocked, we had a large party for our company, we decided to hold happy hours there, but after that first experience we hold them somewhere else! For cocktails and sitting at the bar though Herbs & Rye is great!",

The parking lot is also quite small so finding a space might take a minute. But it's worth it to have a night at this spot.   Once your inside you'll notice the dim lighting & the speak easy ambiance. The music isn't loud which sets the tone for conversation to take place. Sitting at the bar is usually my go to since the bartenders are so welcoming and engaging. Mark has been my bartender several times and is one of my favorite reasons to sit in his area.   I've had at least 5 different cocktails there and was never disappointed. Everything they do is handcrafted and the prices are actually moderately priced. Usually from $10-15 which is actually a really low price point when you consider the mess they serve on the strip.   It's a great place to have a chill night with good friends and excellent drinks. Overall I give this place 5 stars for service and quality",

    "text": "Truly a local gem! This wonderful restaurant and bar is just off the strip and the perfect place to take someone for a more affordable but quintessentially Vegas experience. The happy hour is one of the best in town but I would recommend skipping the discount drinks. This place has one of the best cocktail menus in town and you would be an utter dunce not to indulge in the wide selection of exceptional drinks offered. To compliment the terrific cocktails is a well focused menu with some truly great offerings, especially for those who want to partake in the happy hour discounts. Rhe cocktails are already $11 to $13 each (which is a steal in Vegas for this level of quality), but some of the menu items are half off from 5 to 8pm during the week, particularly the steaks. To start, the carpaccio is as generous as it is delicious with a perfect balance of acidity. I have been to most of the great steakhouses here and the steaks here do not disappoint. They are comparable in quality to steaks I've had in strip restaurants for $10 to $20 more without happy hour discounts. They rely on excellence and quality service here, rather than location and name recognition. I almost feel bad recommending this place, hoping to keep it a bit if a secret for myself and friends who visit. Honestly, I can't wait to go back.",

We initially wanted to sit at the bar but it was full and didn't have seats for three. Seeing as how they had plenty tables open we went back and told one of the hostess we wanted a table instead. They told us there would be a 10 min wait we didn't understand why, they didn't even explain, so we waited the 10 mins. After 15 mins, people were leaving and we were growing tired of waiting especially with tables open. We were waiting behind the hostess booth and we saw they were searching images on google. The hostess would look at us and not even say anything, not even a \"Sorry for waiting\". We were tired so we decided to go back to the bar. The bartender came and asked us what we wanted to drink, we asked for a drink that had egg white in it. His response was \"I don't know we have a lot of those drinks, you need to give me more info.\" After more inconveniences, we decided to leave and not order anything.",

It enticed me away from my usual beer or wine and I was well rewarded. On the food side of things, I consider good vegetable sides to be a reliable gauge for how good the chef is and the (Brussels) sprouts & bacon received high marks, as did my wife's garlic asparagus. I don't think I have ever ordered pork chops when dining out but when I saw that these chops came with a fig glaze, my curiosity got the best of me. I am so glad I took a chance. The fig glaze was great and I enjoyed it very much, but when I took a bite without it I realized it was hiding the flavor burst of the gorgonzola crust. When I took off some of the leaves of the rosemary garnish and sprinkled them on top, I discovered the world's most perfect pork chop. My wife commented to our excellent waiter, Mark, that in 35 years of marriage she had never been so entertained watching me enjoy a meal. Yes, I will return to Herbs & Rye on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We came in on a Friday  night with 7:15 pm reservations. We were seated pretty promptly, and our (very friendly) server greeted us and took our drink orders for the bar right away. And then.....nothing. It took them 30 minutes to get us our cocktails. \"There is a large party in the bar\" we were told. Okay. Not a good excuse, but fine. Whatever. Our server finally brought us our drinks and told us that he comped them due to how long we had to wait. Fine. But there is a problem when you get your appetizers and your salads, and finish eating them, before your drinks come.  And then we waited. And waited. And waited. By 8:45 we still didn't have our food, which consisted of an order of 2 steaks, some broccoli, and truffle mac and cheese. Please remember we got there at 7:15! When we finally did get it, somewhere around 9 pm, the food was good, and of course our poor Embarrassed Server was very apologetic.  I felt so sorry for him. However, there is no excuse for it taking almost 2 hours to cook a couple of steaks. At a steakhouse. They should be much more efficient and proficient at steak-cooking! My husband and I were joking that they must be importing the beef....from Brazil. But by now we both had two ( very well made, despite the loooooooong wait) craft cocktails in us, so we were pretty sauced, considering we had been drinking on almost empty stomachs.  There was a couple sitting across from us who came in after us, and they were (judging by the angry and annoyed looks on their faces) suffering the same wait...and fate....as we were. So obviously this wasn't an anomaly. After we finally finished, Embarrased Server jokingly asked us if we wanted dessert. We told him no thank you, we both have to work on Monday,  just the check please.  We tipped him 20% (poor guy probably though he was going to get stiffed. But it wasn't his fault) and we FINALLY left. It was 9:30.  So, my advice to the Powers That Be at this establishment: Stop trying to save your bottom line by grossly  understaffing your (very busy) establishment. You are extremely lucky to have a restaurant that is this popular and busy in a city that is full of great restaurants. People have many other options in this town.  There is no excuse for having only 2 bartenders in such a busy bar. There is no excuse for your kitchen being so ridiculously slow and backed up.There is no excuse for it taking 2 and a half hours to turn over a two-top. I am sure your servers pay the price for this policy in their bottom lines, as they are usually the ones who get \"stiffed\" when service is too slow or the food (that your customers wait 2 hours for)isn't up to par. Not every ignored  customer is as nice and understanding as my husband and I are. I am pretty sure that your 50% Happy Hour policy, (which don't get me wrong, is fabulous) is the lure you need in order to keep people coming back. Because the service and promptness  certainly are not.  I am giving this restaurant 3 stars. The only reason is due to the courtesy and obvious concern from our poor Embarrassed Server, and the fact that when we FINALLY did get our food, it was good. But not good enough to go through this a second time.",

My friend got a Moscow mule and the ribeye medium with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. My husband got the ribeye medium rare with a side of truffle Mac n' cheese and I got the filet mignon with the brussels sprouts. My food was great! Loved the Brussels sprouts especially. The filet mignon was like butter. My friends ribeye was great, it was well season and cooked perfectly. Her mash potatoes were good too. My husband's truffle Mac n cheese was probably one of the better Mac n cheese we've ever had. His steak was ok. It had a giant silverskin running through it. He ate around it so it wasn't that bad lol. We also got the donuts for dessert and they were amazing! Really great deal if you come for the happy hour and the service was great as well.",

    "text": "Summary: Very solid off strip restaurant.   Neighborhood and this part of Sahara Blvd have seen it's better day and I am sure that they have their up-hill battles w/ marketing this place. The lady and myself ate there on a Wednesday and every seat at the bar was filled for their happy hour (7pm). The two main parts of the restaurant were empty and they sat us at a banquette circular table in the bar area.  Little tight in the bar area as the actual bar itself is only a few feet away from the tables. So when you sit at a table in this area you are sort of forced to stare at the backs (and cracks) of the people sitting at the bar. Decor was retro and speakeasy like - place was clean and well kept. Red patterned wallpaper, TV's playing black and white movies and the music playing the old crooners (Frank, Dean, Sammy etc.).   We ordered two appetizers - the little-neck steamer clams and the fried Calamari. Both were amazing, very tasty and well presented.  The juice or broth that they present the clams in was to die for. They give you a piece of bread that you can dip into the sauce when you are finished eating. We took advantage and LOVED them both!   Good timing in the part of the waiter had our steaks presented to us with enough of a break between finishing the appetizers and starting the main course. Every night they have \"happy hour\" till 8pm and feature all steaks 1/2 price. We took advantage. My date had the fillet ordered rare + (with a fried egg on top) and I went with the rib-eye medium rare with an au pove sauce. We each chose the garlic mashed potatoes as a side.   Steaks were right on and cooked perfectly. Been having issue with this and the chef at Herbs delivered perfectly! The cuts and the sides were stellar and would compete with the best steakhouses on the strip. My rib-eye was as good, if not better than the steak I had at the Wynn, Bellagio, Cosmo and Venetian.   We each ordered two of the \"custom signature throw back cocktails\" from the lengthy drink menu. The menu spans the eras and the drinks from each time period. There are no prices on this section of the menu so be aware of what you are ordering. Most of these drinks fell in the high price or strip casino range ($12 - $15). Little too high priced for an off strip restaurant. They should also feature a couple drinks from this menu during their daily happy hour. Think people would take advantage.   We were way too full and passed on desert (but it looked and smelled delicious).   Bill came and the two of us racked up almost $150 in costs. Was a slightly taken back by this as those prices are what we do at a fancy strip restaurant. Seemed a little excessive for the local driven location. Might hinder price conscious locals? Might hinder us from going back more often, but we will most certainly go back. Food was delicious, service was on point.   Food here is the big winner, food and service earned the 4 stars.   Good job Herbs & Rye - enjoyed the visit.",

I had the NY Strip, which was cooked to perfection and just seasoned perfectly. I didn't need any sauces or additions to make it taste better.  I thought the drinks were good but the prices were a bit steep (but not unexpected).  The donuts were to die for. Seriously the best I've had... and the dipping sauces were the absolute perfect complement! Wow! It is worth a trip just for these!!!  The atmosphere has that dark, prohibition feel. I wasn't sure what to think of it initially but it works. They play music from the era which adds to the ambiance. And finally, the service was super friendly and spot on.   I would highly recommend this place if you are visiting Vegas!",

I got the Kansas City ribeye and it was $14.50, half of the regular $29.  With you dinner comes one side and I got the creamed corn with japaeno.  The steak was cooked perfectly--black and blue as I ordered.  The creamed corn was excellent with the tang of the jalapeno.  I got an iced tea for drink.  Finally, I had a slice of Red Velvet cake for dessert.  I came early and was the only person there when I arrived around 5:30.  As others have stated, the place is quite dark and it takes a time to adjust from the bright sunshine to the darkened interior.  the hostess let me pick where I wanted to sit.  Ronnie was my server, and he was attentive.  Iced tea refills came without asking and he checked back periodically.  I had a show to go to at 7 in North Las Vegas, and this was a perfect time to arrive and enjoy the Happy Hour pricing and have a good dinner before hopping on the freeway for the short drive north.  I'll be back!",

I'm okay with paying 30 to 60 for a steak better be good. The environment was fabulous and the bread and butter is amazing but that's where it stops.  Customer service was good. The staff comped our non eaten food and offered to replace however,  at that point we were done. I give 3 stars because they were trying to correct our problem.  I definitely want to give credit where credit is due. Would not be my 1st recommendation but, for drinks would be a fun place to be.",

The first time I went I had a great experience and my bf had a horrible one (read previous review) However, I talked him into going back and since we've returned 3 more times! We always go for happy hour between midnight and 3am. After trying 3 different steaks my favorite is the Bone in Kansas City cooked medium well add herbs and rye rub. I've had the blue cheese crust and the mushrooms and onions toppers. Both are yummy but they don't top the rub. Another highlight is the chicken wings. They are so different from any wings I have ever tried. I also had a chopped salad that was a meal in itself. I don't know what it is but every time I go here, I eat every single bite of everything. Appetizer, salads, sides, desserts (get the donuts) EVERYTHING!  The mixology is one of a kind. Whether you choose one of the old school vivations, or a simple cran & vodka- its made special every time. They truly aim to please. So ignore the fact that this place looks like a hole in the wall bar, because once you walk thru those doors you are in a whole new time. A classy, enjoyable one.",

We picked Herbs & Rye on the fly and it was a nice choice, especially since they stay open late.  I had: tomato bisque with grilled cheese  side of truffle mac n cheese some of the calamari that Mel ordered  First of all, it's dark in there.  I had a hard time reading my menu.  They play really good music.  The service is great and our food came out fast.  Maybe because I couldn't see that well in the dark or because I was sleepy, I didn't realize my soup came with a grilled cheese sandwich.  I probably wouldn't have ordered the mac n cheese side, but then again, I love mac n cheese and theirs was flavorful. I enjoyed everything I had except the calamari.  There was too much going on there with some assorted toppings and I'm not even sure what they were:  green peppers, green onions, some kind of mayo dressing?  I had to dig towards the bottom of the bowl to get to some of the calamari that was untouched by all that stuff.   Overall, it was a great meal and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place.  We'll have to go back to try one of the alcoholic concoctions on the menu that looked great and when I'm more awake.",

This time we decided to venture out and try a spot all the locals rave about. I made a reservation on their website - highly recommend, when we arrived, the wait was two hours without one. Happy hour ends at 7. We arrived at 5:45. Happy hour is half off all of their steaks! What an awesome deal!!! I had a 9 oz filet mignon, it was amazing and comes with your choice of one side. I opted for truffle Mac and cheese - delicious. My friends had the creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. The food was good, I am only giving 4 stars because the blue cheese was cold and wasn't melted like it should be as a blue cheese crust. I asked if they could melt it on the side and they said no and brought be cold blue cheese instead. Also, the horseradish that my friend ordered was brown - didn't look or taste fresh. The libations were really good and super strong! Hence the small glasses they are served in. The vibe overall is super cool - vintage dark, speak easy. I was hesitant at first, the front door is beat up and the entry is short and narrow, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. While it doesn't have the glitz and glamour like the big fancy restaurants on the strip, I would say it is worth an Uber drive to venture out and try something new!",

Our server was very knowledgable in the realm of cocktails and had excellent suggestions! The meal was mouth watering, rich, and damn delicious! The NY Strip was so juicy and just the right amount of rare paired with some asparagus and the truffle mac and cheese, done and done! We will absolutely be back, thank you for making our even that much more enjoyable :)",

Dark, clubby, with a sort of hipster take on vintage Vegas...cool menu full of mixology \"craft\" cocktails...solid steaks and accouterments. A cool place to go for late-night food...and located in a SOLIDLY unpretentious part of town (bonus points!!!).   I went during regular hours and had a filet with a side of mushrooms, and caesar salad. All were good, but a pit pricey for what they were. I'll have to go back and try the happy hour menu...I have a feeling my cheap ass will like that more!  Overall, I endorse this spot.",

    "text": "Outstanding! Fantastic! Amazing! Delectable!  We couldn't be happier with our dinner experience tonight.  The decor is dark and rich like an old speakeasy.  We sat in a cozy booth by the bar.  Chandeliers, velvet embellished wallpaper, and candles.  We went for happy hour.  It runs 5 - 8 and again from 12 - 3.  $5 well drinks and $3 house draught irish red.  50% off select menu items.  We started with the fries to snack on.  They aren't part of happy hour; they were $5.  They were perfect.  Hot, perfectly crispy and seasoned to perfection with salt and pepper.  Each fry had a perfect coating.    Next we had linguini and clams and 12 oz. strip steak with truffled mac and cheese.  It was all magical.  The linguini and clams was surprisingly spicy and flavorful. ($12.50) The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and everything was seasoned perfectly.  The truffled mac and cheese was creamy and dreamy ($14.50).  The dinners were served with bread topped with balsamic butter.  Although they aren't part of happy hour, we partook in some of their signature cocktails.  I had the diablo, a tequila, cassis, ginger ale concoction, and hubs had the martinez, a gin maraschino, lemon mix.  Both we excellent and strong ($9 each).  We then each had the house irish red ($3).  Service was super friendly, and attentive.  Total bill - $60 ?!?!?  For an app, 4 drinks, and 2 entrees! amazing! We would have paid full price but why when there is happy hour!  Can't wait to tell everyone and go back!",

All the cocktails are organized by time period adding character to the menu, and to be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the cocktail menu. The best time to go is happy hour from midnight to close where steaks and other items are half off. Go for the steaks. Every steak I've ordered is cooked PERFECTLY! Some of the best steaks I've had have come from Herbs & Rye and they don't even consider themselves a steakhouse. This is my go to place when I'm looking for a classier place with great food and drinks. Herbs & Rye is a Vegas gem.",

    "text": "We went here for after dinner cocktails.  If you are ever in Vegas and want to get away from the strip I would have to say go here. Something low key. It's a prohibition gangster style bar and steakhouse.   The cocktails are $10 each which is not bad for Vegas prices.  They also have a beer that they make. I believe it's an IPA. That was hoppily delightful.   Although I did not eat there the food looked and smelled great. Although that was closer to Vegas prices but I think still a little cheaper.   You won't find cran and vodka here. Not even a manhattan. Think rye, absinthe, and bourbon based drinks. The bartenders are very friendly and can recommend something if you are unsure about the ingredients (a few drinks have egg white for \"froth and a creamy texture\")  I have been to Vegas several times and I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip.   Also happy hour (or hours) are 5p-8p and midnight-3a.",

    "text": "Finally made it down to Herbs & Rye for their Happy Hour specials and I was very pleased with my experience.   The atmosphere is pretty cozy and I would like to get a booth next time and settle in for a longer period of time. They have some pretty good Happy Hour specials. I can't wait to try their flatbread pizzas and steaks, but on this occasion I ordered the meatballs with chorizo and the sweet potato tots. We were just making a short pit stop here on our way to dinner so didn't get an opportunity to try all the menu items that I was craving. The meatballs were lovely. Delicious and spicy. The sauce was delightful and I was hoping for a roll or some bread to sop up the rest of it with, but the bartender claimed they were out. We tried to order the bruschetta as well, but were told they were out of that too, so I guess I have to believe him on the bread thing. The tots were ok. Pretty much exactly as you picture them. Sweet potato tater tots, so self-explanatory and not really worth further description. Pretty good on the whole though.   Now for the drinks. At $5 a pop for well drinks they certainly treat you right. There was barely a hint of tonic in my vodka tonic, which I had a hard time downing at first, but was much easier with an extra lime and some food to make it go down easier.   Great deal in general. I look forward to my next visit!",

Our group of 4 had an 8:30pm reservation. We arrived at 8:00pm & checked in with the hostess. She promptly informed us that \"Your table will not be ready until 8:30.\"  That was fine we had planned on a predinner cocktail in the lounge prior to our meal. When 9:00pm arrived and one of our group checked with the hostess her response was \"We are waiting for a table to clear, we will come get you when it's ready.\" Other than the wait & her attitude it was a great experience.",

Their drinks were good but we didn't feel they were unique or exceptional.  We ordered Vieux, Jack Rose and Ward Eight which were all recommendations from our server.  The food (ordered Ribeye, NY strip, mac & cheese, and garlic mash) was average, but I didn't hold it against them too much because it was happy hour pricing.  Overall, value-wise, it's very affordable.  Also interesting note, if you call before they open (5pm I think) you're going to be told that their number is not in service.  Now where I'm from, you get that message when your number is disconnected or you're no longer in business.  I thought this place has gone out of business until I called right at 5pm just for the hell of it, and the hostess picked up.  LOL.",

Happy Hour is from 5pm - 8pm. Which is great!   Steaks on their menu are half off and so are a few of their cocktails. Well drinks are $5. Can't go wrong with those deals.   We started with the Flatbread Bruschetta, which was to die for. Never had a better Bruschetta.! It was so good. The bread was perfectly cooked. Boyfriend had the New York Strip (Medium Rare) which was half off also added the Herbs and Rye House Rub which is slightly spicy and gives your steak that perfect flavor. His side was the Jalapeno Creamed Corn which was delicious as well with the perfect punch of heat. I ordered the Bone In Pork Chop (Medium Well) and paired it with the Truffle Mac & Cheese. Pork Chop was perfectly cooked. Nice big chunk of pork on my plate. The truffle Mac & Cheese was oh so delicious melt in your mouth.   The atmosphere is dark and intimate, from the outside it looks like a small space. Walking in there they had 2 sides of dining rooms. and a big bar area. I would definitely recommend this place. And next time I will order dessert.",

If you go during happy hour (which I believe is everyday from 5pm-8pm), you may also get half off of your menu item(s)... This is not on everything but is not limited to just drinks and appetizers.   Parking may be difficult. I'd suggest taking a Lyft or an Uber, unless you don't mind taking your chances for a space that may be available or parking further away. Being a popular restaurant, it would also be wise to make a reservation (wait times can be an hour). The restaurant is very bustling and lively; good for groups and dinner dates. The downside to that is service from the staff can be a little slow.",

Made reservations online, came in today to say there is no reservations for us and no seats available. The restaurant was empty and they only had 1 reservation for 6pm in their computer. Lady at the host desk wasn't very pleasant either. Definitely won't be back!  Answer to the response from whoever. 1. Aren't you supposed to be the professional? 2. I'm not stupid, I know where I was. 3. The restaurant was empty when we walked in 4. Your STAFF showed me the computer.  Don't worry, we won't be back. Thanks for being a crappy business",

    "text": "On our way to herbs and rye, my car was hit by a truck and the truck driver decided to take off without stopping leaving us with no insurance information and forcing us to follow him to take pictures of the license plate. Luckily, it was minor body damage, but my girlfriend and I were still shaken up by the ordeal. We attempted to steel our nerves and continued our way to herbs and rye after making a police report. We were shaky and in desperate need for a drink.   Nothing could have turned this bad night into a good one the way Herbs and Rye did. The drinks were crisp and refreshing and took the edge off just enough so that we could hold our forks straight to enjoy our food. Best Meatballs I have had. Ever.  We had the pleasure of being served by Mark Vega. Now I didn't meet too many people at Herbs and Rye, but i'd like to think that Mark is the premier waiter whose serving chops inspire all other associates around him. Everything Mark did and said was both fun and comforting, and made us feel like welcomed guests, despite this being our first time.   We live in LA and don't make it to Vegas often. However, Herbs and Rye has earned a permanent spot on our \"Must Do\" list next time we visit.  Thank you Mark, and thank you Herbs and Rye!",

Not a traditional Calamari dish as far as Italian etc. having said that, the breading and remolaude were excellent. I order a whiskey smash. It was made from the well. It was balanced and excellent. Service and atmosphere were enjoyable and exceeded the price point. Absolutely recommend.",

It was pretty busy and loud but it didn't seem short of anything but good vibes! I highly recommend coming here. We made a rookie mistake of not going during happy hour when a lot of entrees and drinks are HALF OFF! However, it still will be on the pricey side I suppose. Oh and we did have a snooty server. Regardless it was a great dinner. The presentation of the food was very nice and my favorite was the red wine glaze that came with the filet mignon! It was delicious. Im even considering having my birthday dinner here! It seems perfect for a big group of friends to start or perhaps end the night with!   The first two pages of there menu are food items and the rest of it is a really extensive drink menu. I shared the surf and turf with a side of cream of corn (MY FAVORITE) and mac n cheese! Highly recommend them to you all.",

It's definitely a must try you've definitely got to come here during happy hour all stakes are half price so I got my beautiful ribeye steak for $30 in Stead of the 60 it shows on the menu. Comes with one side get the truffle macaroni and cheese it will blow your freaking mind. Also so big I could not finish it there sad part is I had to microwave the next day and it was still tender enough to cut with a fork I never thought I would see that my life. drink specials are great never had a Moskal meal before and it was amazing I will definitely be coming back to this place. Would definitely say it's one of the best happy hours for food in town.",

Oh and ambiance is nice.  This place has it.  Bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and care about what you want. So you love what your drinking.   Great cocktail menu that highlights cocktails through the decades.  Little bit of history with each.  I judge a bar on details.  Like, they refrigerate their sweet vermouth, candied cherries, bartenders that enjoy talking to their patrons and they make perfect cocktails, textbook!  I love drinking a VESPER, let me tell you, few bars do it well, they do it perfect!  I hope I don't come across as being a pretentious cocktail douche, I'm not.   I've been accused of being a hipster, maybe a little, but nope.  Just a guy that loves a great cocktail.   Don't forget about thhe food.  Best steak, amazing steak tartare.  Just wish they had a bone marrow dish on the menu.  OMG that sounds so hipster douche.   I hope I'm not having an epiphany.  Anyway, if you love #EmploeesOnly in NYC (check out the new one in M8 am I Beach), #minibar DC,  #theviolethour Chicago, then you will love Herbs & Rye.  Great Uber access, both to and fro.  I just realized I want to move to to Asheville, I'm a hipster.  Crap.",

    "text": "Just heard great things about the place, half price steaks during happy hour, etc. We were seated right away next to the bar, it's very dark and I wondered if they had little flashlights on the menu like at Capo's up the road, but they did not.  The music was really loud, therefore everyone is yelling to each other, it was a tad deafening. Our server Joe P was not very good.  As soon as we sat down he was instantly there wanting to take our order, we asked for a few mins to decide, however he was too busy chatting to and hugging friends to come back in a reasonable time, took almost 15 mins. After ordering we got a basket of bread that was warming and crusty. Apps arrived, My French onion soup was bland and quite sweet with a huge inedible hunk of bread on it.  Johan had the clams, first time ever and he enjoyed them. Timing between courses was terrible, good 20 mins after apps were finished did we get the entrees.   We both ordered rib eyes, one med and one med well, both with the whiskey shallot potatoes and a side of truffle Mac and cheese.  However they had only 1 potatoes and one sweet potato tots, I said to the meal runner that it was wrong, then Joe P appeared and looked at his pad and said, that's correct, I wrote down sweet potato tots.  Had he repeated the order back he would have picked up the error. Truffle Mac and cheese was ok, creamy and moist.  Whiskey potatoes were too greasy, just like chunky mashed with whiskey and shallots and cheese. It's so dark in there you can hardly see if your steak is over / under cooked.  We took a few bites till we realized they were backwards.  However both steaks were tasteless and bland, no salt or pepper on table cause they should be seasoned to perfection.  $60 for this steak? Not worth it. Joe P never checked in on how any of our meals were, had no personality, might have been an off night but we won't be back.",

Side: If you like sprouts, their Sprouts & Swine is FANTASTIC! 4. Dessert: They have a Cookie Dessert. This is the one to get :)",

He was hilarious, full of jokes and music and movie references. We started with the Carpaccio which was delicious Then our main courses we had the Spicy Mussels along with the NY Strip Steak with the Whiskey Shallot Potatoes on the side. Everything was delicious, steak was cooked exactly how I ordered it and it cut like butter. I got the Brandy Peppercorn Sauce to drizzle on top and it was a good addition. After our meal we ordered the donuts which were so warm and soft.   The music in this place was so great and all over the spectrum. We thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary dinner and MarK with a K was such a great waiter. Everything came out expediently which surprised us for how busy they were. We can't wait to go back here again and maybe it will be for happy hour because I've read that steaks are 50% off. Done! Go here and leave fat, full and happy because I know we did.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying we were recommended this place by a waiter in Cosmo & he nailed it. It's half price steaks, drinks, and other menu items between 5-8p. One caveat to that though, if you don't stand outside and wait for the doors to open by 445p, you won't get a seat before 630pm. This place gets packed quick. The Ribeye was cooked perfectly, the jalapeno creamed corn was a surprising dark horse on the menu that tasted awesome. Our server/bartender Matthew was great. We will be back and we will recommend this place to anyone wanting to venture off the strip.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place as it is my go to on the regular here as a local for happy hour and dinner as well as a place to take my guests who are visiting. It's just THAT good!  You can't beat their happy hour any place else, so don't try! Happy hour begins at 5pm when they open until 8pm. Anticipate a crowd, people come here who are visiting and who are getting off of work. If you're solo you are definitely going to be able to get a seat at the bar relatively quickly (so wait it out). Second happy hour begins at MIDNIGHT until 3am. Yes MIDNIGHT. Why not start your party here?   What's included with their happy hour? All steaks are 1/2 price including their well drinks. I'm not a well drink kind of girl and their bartenders make excellent cocktails so I recommend the latter. All of their steaks are phenomenal if you order it properly. medium to medium rare or as the chef suggests. If you're a bleu cheese person, yes get the crusted bleu cheese on top! And for the love of God please order the \"Sprouts & Swine\" Which are the most amazing brussel sprouts cooked with bacon you've ever had! The garlic mash is to die for as well as the truffle mac or  truffle fries. Honestly, everything on the menu is incredibly tasty, the waitstaff super knowledgeable and extremely friendly. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, it's great for many occasions, casual dinner or date, to birthdays, late night dinner and a place to pre-game before going out on the strip. You can't lose! Gogogogo!",

I chose Herbs & Rye due to the awesome reviews and their happy hour deals. What I didn't know is that basically you still get robbed on your bill. Technically your bill should be based on what you paid and your taxed on what you paid and you tip on what you paid. Nope not here. Now do-not get me wrong my waiter was fabulous and I am all for paying 20%. But if my bill is $369.25 with tax and tip how the hell you figure you should get $524.18. When I questioned it I was told it based on the price before the discounts. YEA I DONT THINK SO. Very very disappointed with your way of doing business.   5/16. It's funny how I made this complaint and no one has ever responded. Soo sad.",

    "text": "We'd been here before for drinks on recommendation from the guys at a Downtown Cocktail Room, and had no intentions for dinner what with piles of Thanksgiving leftovers waiting at home, but when our excellent server Charlie informed us we had four minutes if we still wanted to get a Happy Hour order in, we had to ask what Happy Hour was? And when we learned Happy Hour was half off steaks -- what's a reasonable person to do??  Our table ordered filets and a ribeye. The came out promptly (and this was on a very busy Friday night) and all perfectly cooked and seasoned -- juicy with a nice char and very simple seasoning of salt and pepper that enhanced the meat without competing with it. The steaks came with one side each and we got the garlic mash, truffle fries, and sweet potato tots, which were all fine, though I wish we'd seen the option for marshmallow on the tots.  The cocktail menu is extensive and well curated. We got: Hemingway Daiquiri Martinez Lion's Tale Clover Club Brandy Crusta French 75 Hawthorne Pisco Sour  All on point. As was the service from Charlie and the rest of the serving staff: helpful recommendations when we asked, unobtrusive place setting clearing and setup and refills. Vibe was lively in the bar area but we didn't feel crowded. It does get loud, ad we needed additional light from our phones and the table candle to read our menus. Dug the playlist. Parking is tight, and I'd recommend reservations.  We'll be back to drink our way through the rest of the cocktail menu and for the amazing, ridiculously discounted happy hour steak!",

A few damn good memories of this place too:  - First time i had anything from the FuKu truck they were parked outside of H&R  - Going away shindig ended at H&R  - Did a few birthdays at H&R  - Coming back shindig started where we left off at H&R  So it's been another year...Whats new?  Happy hour is still there and all steaks are still half off during happy hour. Well all beef steaks, sorry pork chops and figs guess i'll never discover how you'll taste...  New draft beer selection. Wow i thought the house Amber was good the new draft selection goes hipster with their selection of micro brews and crap i've never even heard of. I've just discovered i actually do enjoy stout beers now. Funny how one thing can change your opinion of the entire category.   New super large rib eye steak selection/challenges.   14oz NY Strip on the menu now (personal favorite)   So umm...yeah",

    "text": "Went for my favorite steak last night at Herbs and Rye for a get together with friends and a belated birthday for my wife. I have been to Herbs many times in the past 2 years since I moved to Vegas, brought friends and relatives here for the drinks and food. Well let me tell you this was the last time.   We had a party of 12 and upon arrival we made it clear we wanted separate checks or 3 checks of 4 and wee told by the 'manager' on duty it wouldn't be a problem. SO the drinks came, and we ordered and as usual, the food was excellent and the drinks were great. We arrived just before 7pm to be sure we would get served for Happy Hour. Service was very slow for just about everything. We did not get our food until after 8pm and at 8:08 I ordered a beer and was told Happy Hour was over and it would be full price (this was after ordering 2 bottles of 40 dollar wine, multiple 11 dollar cocktails and beers). So when they say Happy Hour ends at 8, they mean it.   About 9ish we had finished our meal and were waiting for the waitress to come around for about 15 minutes with the 'birthday donuts' and they finally did. Then we waited for the check....and waited.....and waited...spoke to the manager about the service we were receiving. SO we waited some more. Finally about 9:45 we got our check....ALL ON ONE BILL....when we told we were granted permission to get separate checks the waitress said she couldn't do it. We insisted she did so she took the check back and went out back....and we waited...and waited...NO DRINKS, NO SERVICE, NO QUESTIONS BEING ANSWERED. Finally at 10:20 I asked to speak to the 'manager.' He came out and gave a speech about how hard it was to divide the check up. I told him to ask the waitress to come out so we could help her with the check. The manager was of no help. Now we have been there for over 3 hours, nothing comped, nothing answered, and she comes out with the split checks and they are ALL WRONG.   Needless to say it was very frustrating. We ended up staying about 20 minutes longer to get the check straightened out and finally left.   I'm now looking for the next best steak because I won't step foot back in that place after the way the manager acted.",

Our server in the bar area tables was not the best as far as guest empathy and showing concern, and the drinks took *forever* to arrive, but maybe it was an off night for her when we went.  The bartender was busy talking to the people sitting at the bar and possibly didn't see the drink ticket?  Our server was nice enough, just not super nice, nor super attentive.  Of the things we tried for dinner, the little neck clams were delicious.  My advice is skip the very good steak - get the Pork and Figs instead!!  OUTSTANDING.

    "text": "Cocktail geeks rejoice - craft cocktails exist in Vegas. I'm not sure since when, but they're here in full effect at Herbs & Rye. The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.  This is the lest \"Vegas\" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot.   The cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks.   The story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a True barman.   The food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill.   For a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did.",

    "text": "I was here with my sister and her pharmacy school friends a couple nights ago and was overall quite pleased with my experience. We originally made a reservation for 10 but we must have miscounted because we actually had 12 people in our party. What should've been an easy fix (adding a couple chairs and place settings) took about fifteen minutes and my sister overheard the waiters whispering to each other about making us wait longer since we inconvenienced them. Very uncool.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that it was very VERY dim. It took a while for my eyes to adjust, but I guess it added to the ambiance. The service was a little slow but the food was quite good. Since we had a party of more than 8, we were told to order appetizers and share them family style which would cost each of us $8. We agreed to it and were not disappointed. We got margherita flatbread, meatballs, calamari, and caprese salad. For my entree I ordered a flat iron and it was cooked perfectly and tasted great. I ordered truffle fries for my side and the portion was huge. So even though the steak was a little pricey, I feel like I pretty much paid for two. We made happy hour thanks to our waiter who disclosed to us that we should order our entrees quickly before it ended. This meant that all of the steak entrees were half off which is a pretty great deal. At the very end, our waiter brought out free desserts for us which brings them up to four stars despite the questionable service at the beginning.",

You're immediately greeted by the host and seated with little to no wait at all.  They have a private seating area, bar area seating, and a dining area as well.    The interior and decor has a great Italian old school vibe to it.  The bathroom (yes, I have to review that, too) is well maintained and beautiful.    Outstanding menu with non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages to choose from.  Their appetizer, entree, and dessert selections are great and vegetarian friendly also.  The calamari and rib eye are my all time favorite.  Great presentation!  Food quality is phenomenal!  Portions are great!  The waiters are knowledgeable.  Wait time for food is acceptable.    Our server was very attentive to refilling our drinks and asking how things were.  The bill is brought out when you're ready to pay.  You don't feel rushed at all.  Very pleasant staff!

The dinner hour rush was over and there was only 4 tables that had people. So it was slow. We waited 75 mins before we received our food. We had to call the waiter over 3 times to get water to our table and final after 45 mins if waiting I ask if our food was coming. We were told that it was coming right out. I called the waiter again and then he said that the order did not make the kitchen since their ticket machine in the back was not working. However other people that arrived after us did receive their food on time and faster than us.  We final received our meal and the dishes came out separate.  My pork chop was not hot and I just are it as everyone else had received their food and we were ready to leave.  The waiter asked if we needed anything else and said he was sorry about the wait. I was pleased that he apologized but said that he would have to ask the manager if they could discount the meal since we waited so long. When the bill came they took off 2 drink for a table of 3 and did not discount the food????  Thanks for the $8 discount on a $80 ticket. Could do more...especially for locals that brings u business.    I will have to consider going back again.  Sad because it is a cool place to go that True Vegas",

He was friendly but couldve been more attentive. We needed more water and menus as the party arrived. Happy hour wasn't great. The 2 star items on the menu that was half off was very limited and expensive to begin w/. Tried some cocktails bizz neez(?) resembles a lemonade and the other more popular grapefruit-like cocktail. Nice and light, kinda like a crystal lite. Ordered the skirt steak well-done & truffle mac &cheese w/ bacon side. It was a little over cooked bc it was tough to cut and very dry. I know I ordered well-done, but I've had well done steak and it should not be that dry. The truffle mac and cheese is slightly under cooked. Took it home and the next day it was sitting in a pool of oil (: yumm!!   I enjoyed the company &the atmosphere but there are better places in Vegas. Thanks but no thanks.",

    "text": "I have somewhat mixed feelings about this place. The service is excellent, and the first time you visit it seems like a special place: it's moody and atmospheric.  I go back there only for two dishes: the pork and figs (with gorgonzola) and the jalapeno creamed corn. Both are excellent.  The other dishes I've had have been fairly ordinary: the chicken wings were a big disappointment, while the steaks and fries aren't very exciting.  Service is on the slow side, which is fine for me, but may frustrate others. One of my family members didn't enjoy our visit there due to the dark lighting: it really is dark (so dark that the waiters carry torches to help with the menu), so don't go if you're not comfortable in such environments.",

(Flatbread in the interim had climbed to $10). Things are a changing at H&R. Now, they're each non-happy-hour-priced at around $13/ea, and the only happy hour appys are the mussels and the clam linguine. So much for the good ol' days. Not so happy hour. Sneakin' those prices up. Definitely not worth a $30 hit. I left when I discovered this new situation. Pffft.",

Two other smaller parties were seated near us and served before us, our waitress checked on us a total of 4 times, she stuck by the book as far as a sever goes canned and well rehearsed didn't feel like she earned her 25% added gratuity on a check of $400+ Took her a second passing to clear our empty appetizer plates, and a third passing to ask if we wanted another drink. Really disappointing experience for a place we love to go, I would have at least appreciated an apology especially because I had to hunt someone down to request our check.

    "text": "Great non-hotel/casino steakhouse!  Always ask the hotel/casino employees for the best places, they will know what's good, inexpensive, etc.  My wife and I are staying at Caesars, many many choices of dining to choose from, most of them probably going to ding you at least $100 per person, so we tried this hole in the wall on W Sahara, about a $15 cab ride from our hotel.  Older building and decor, sort of a Victorian style, very dark - you get a distinct '60's feel in there.  Their dinner menu features many $50+ steaks, however they run a \"happy hour\" from 5pm-8pm, where most of the entrees are discounted 50% - my $42  14oz. NY Strip was $21, my wife had the 9oz. filet for $26 (menu price $52), and so on.  We had Little neck clams as an appetizer - $12.  Cocktails were reasonable, my wife's Manhattan was $11, my Grey Goose vodka was $13, and the first time I've ever seen this - was charged $1.95 for a \"large ice cube\".  The drink was great, I didn't complain, but I haven't seen a charge for an ice cube before.  Steaks were cooked to perfection and were excellent.  We noticed there were no salt and pepper shakers on any of the tables, I think their philosophy is that you're not going to need to doctor your steak in any way - in our case that was 100% correct, they were great!  Sides come with your entree, we opted for the Smashed Whiskey Potatoes (yum) and the Garlicky Spinach (also yum).  We were full, but had to try their signature Doughnuts (see photo), home made and decadent.  We got out of there paying a $114 check, which was not bad considering 3 cocktails (including my $1.95 ice cube), an appetizer, entrees and dessert!  Very friendly service staff, this is a must-try place on your next Vegas visit!",

The steak was incredible and if you don't get the bacon on it you are a fool. It is the most delicious bacon I've ever had. The sides are nice as well. The beat is that if you eat there before 8 you get half off your steak. This only adds to the enjoyment. This place is fun, crowded, and has phenomenal steak.

This is a little off the beaten path, so if you are a tourist visiting, not only is it difficult to find, but a little tough to allow for the time away from the strip and everything else Vegas has to offer. Came here during NADA this year and was pleasantly surprised that my group of 8 was able to walk in, without reservations and enjoy a fantastic meal. We all ended up sharing things from steak to pasta to chicken. I also introduced a coworker to absinthe. They make it traditionally, so you get a show with the cocktail as well. Everything is so well done here, from the food to the drinks to the meticulously decorated interior. I absolutely love Herbs & Rye!",

Well instead of coming and getting us to be seated they grabbed the other big party that arrived 20 minutes after us and seated them. They stated because they were busy they just grabbed the nearest group. Unprofessional!  We ended up waiting almost 2 hours to be seated. They said they would take care of us and I guess that meant sending out extra appetizers. When our bill came and they split it each group had over a 30% gratuity added. Thank God for the company I was with otherwise this would have been one of the worst nights out ever. They have forever lost us!  Good luck to whoever makes reservations and expects a great experience!  Also I would like to note I would not give this place any stars but it makes you.",

As with other reviews, he elevates your experience.  He is very knowledgeable and engaging.  We got margarita flat bread and little neck clams for appetizers.  The crust on the flat bread was done to perfection, just the right crunch.  The clams have the best broth to be soaked up by the equally tasty bread.  1st round was The Boulevardier, a very nicely done bourbon based drink, but it was quickly topped by a smooth View Carre, an El Diablo a fine representative for tequila, and a mock tail of club soda, cucumber, a touch of sweet and sour and mint, it was very refreshing.  Our meals were the Linguini & Clams, Pappardelle, New York Strip and Bone in Pork Chop.  Everything was cooked to our expectations.  The stand out was the Pork Chop.  I let Mark setup the entire entree and he delivered.  It was cooked medium with the spice rub and blue cheese crust, and Sprouts and Swine side. There is nothing I can say to describe the taste, just the best pork and brussel sprouts I've ever had.  Bottom line, Herbs & Rye is \"THE\" place to eat and drink in Vegas.  Oh, and the donuts are a fantastic ending!",

Hidden costs abound or are written in fine print in the menu which are difficult to read in the dimmed- light atmosphere. For instance, if you split a meal with someone, Herbs and Rye will hand you an empty plate to divide your servings and then add on a $7.00 charge for this extra plate. They also charge a 20 percent gratuity- which includes the tax - and is based on the full price of the meal and not the \"happy hour\" prices. The steak is merely ok, the drink servings are small. Seriously, why bother? It's Vegas and truly great places abound with no hidden surprises in your bill and fabulous food and drinks. I'll take Del Friscos or Hank's any day!",

Their drink specials were on wells and to be completely honest, I'm not going somewhere known for craft cocktails only to drink wells. I only wish we had been hungry enough for a steak! We split a side of the truffle mac with bacon. Life changing!  Probably one of the most creative menus I've ever seen. I read it like a book! Their selection of hand crafted drinks and spirits are insane and their mixology is on point. Delicious champagne cocktail, too.   Tons of locals there. So glad we went with the several recommendations we had and checked this one out.",

    "text": "When traveling, I always like to try and find one of the local places off the main drag. A friend of mine who lives in Vegas met me for dinner while on a trip. We headed away from the strip to Herbs & Rye.. a place that my friend had heard of and wanted to visit.  Pulling up, I had to tell myself that outside appearances are often deceiving. We parked outside the rather plain building and walked into a beautiful restaurant. After my eyes adjusted to the super low light level, I saw exposed brick walls accented with deep shades of red splashed throughout the place.  We made a reservation on OpenTable and were seated immediately after checking in with the hostess. She gave us a choice of sitting at a table in the bar area, or a seat in the main dining room. We chose to sit in the dining room so we could chat. With only 6 or so tables, it was perfect to carry on a conversation.  I was really looking forward to a drink after reading the reviews on Yelp and seeing the photos other reviewers had added. A killer headache kept me to water only, but I definitely had drink envy when the party next to me started getting drinks. The menu was smaller than I expected. Steaks make up most of the main course options along with few pasta dishes, but they do have starters, salads and flatbreads.  Our server came over and welcomed us, and let us know since we arrived before their 8am Happy Hour ended, all of the items marked with stars were half off. This definitely changed my mind, and I went for the 8oz flatiron steak with a side of asparagus. Normally $28, I got it half off for $14. Not too bad.. and definitely cheaper than I could have found anywhere on the strip. I will say my first choice in sides was Brussel Sprouts, but they were deep fried, which turned me off of them. Most of the sides were deep fried, and when it came to healthier side items, the menu definitely was lacking.  The steak came out perfect. Seasoned only with salt and pepper, my medium steak was juicy and absolutely delicious. I felt bad not being able to eat it all. The asparagus, on the other hand, could have been better. It was served in a small cast iron skillet and had been overcooked to the point of almost losing all of its beautiful green color. It was mushy and swimming in butter and had absolutely no bite to it at all. Perhaps I should have stuck to something in season... or perhaps it shouldn't be on the menu if it's not fresh.  Aside from the asparagus, everything else was spot on. The steak was delicious. The service was impeccable, and my water glass was always full (and I drank about a gallon of water). Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a place off the strip for a night out.",

    "text": "Been here a half dozen times. Food is ok. The gimmick about 1/2 off food is just that, a gimmick. If you paid full price for a select grade of beef you'd be very mad. We were there on a Friday night and it seemed, by our waiters attitude, that he wanted to turn this table fast. Waited 10 minutes and when he came up his first comment was, well what can we get you for dinner tonight. Didn't ask if we had any questions or suggest a cocktail, which is one of the best things they do there.  We ordered 4 drinks, Manhattan, Martini, Gin and Tonic and Old Fashion. I asked if the Old Fashion came with a large ice cube, he said yes. We got the drinks and the OF didn't have a orange peel or cherry. So I asked if I could get a cherry and his response was, our OF doesn't come with a cherry but I'll get you one. I don't recall ever having one that didn't but it's their version.   The other times we've been there we've always ordered a bottle of red wine. The wine list in the menu is crazy high priced. Lowest red wine on it was $50 for a red rosso and I think the next one was $78 and they went up to $400+. That's great if you're eating a prime grade piece of meat and trying to impress clients. But for the average diner, that seemed out of context. I asked if they had a separate wine list with a wider range of wines to choose from (and we all swear we remember one in other visits) and he said no this was it??? The list had a few by the glass so we said we'll each just have a glass of the Estancia Cab. Not a great cab and it was $14 a glass which is high for a bottle that sells for $20 +/-.  We thought it had to be better than the \"rosso\"....but we got, sorry we're out of that.   Then when we got the bill, it showed a \"Prep: Cocktail\" charge of $2.20 for each drink and $1.65 for the large cube which was even added to the GT that didn't have one. Not sure what a prep fee is on a cocktail? We were surprised that they didn't add a Cooking fee for grilling our steaks. By then with; mediocre food, lousy service, terrible wine choices, we weren't going argue about a few bucks. We just chalked it up to a learning experience that we won't have to go through again since that'll be our last trip to the Herb and Rye!",

    "text": "Ok so here is your deal of the day in FABULOUS LAS VEGAS, come here, for an early happy hour or after midnight. The steaks are all on the 50% fire sale... seriously BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL AT Herbs & Rye! and its super tasty to boot! So drag your bootay over here off the strip for a split second or ten and descend into decadent gluttony for a bit.  I arrived with a group of folks around 12:30 or so and most of us had had a few drinks already and had been gambling for a few hours. We hadn't had dinner yet as we were planning on coming here and had heard about it from one of my buddies who is a local. It was described as a great steak joint with cheap high end fare. It did not disappoint on that perspective whatsoever.  Pro Tip: Parking early can be tough, so be forwarned, perhaps taxi it over =D  I got the 18oz boneless ribeye for $29 Dee LISH  Ushhhhhh. Normally it is $58! Well I want another one right now... and the bacon haphazardly tossed on top was awesome as well. I had the bacon topper which was two thick cuts of my favorite veggie crossed on top of the steak. WOW, just WOW.  Pro Tip #2: Do NOT ask for steak sauce unless you are an uncouth Neanderthal with no understanding of good steak. Some jackwagon in my group asked for it and a few of us had our eyes just about pop out of our heads!  You get a side with it and I kinda messed up trying something experimental but *shrugs* the steak and bacon were AWESOME.  But for my side I got the asparagus with the broccoli cheese sauce and it didn't turnout as well as I had hoped it would.   Pro Tip #3: Drink up before you get here. Their drinks are a bit pricy and kitchee IMHO. Unless you want to drink specialty drinks at $8-$15/ea...  The bread was fresh and super toasty tasty and just what you would need or expect for a meal like this. Ahhh the memories of this meal are still so fresh in my head I can taste that steak and the bacon strips! Since I have been here, I have had several friends hit this place up and no one has a bad thing to say about the steaks.   I definitely plan on hitting this joint up again on another vegas run and I think you should too!",

I know some people come here for their drinks, but my bf and I aren't big drinkers and we appreciate the preparation and the creativity behind food more so than drinks. It's been a while and I can't really remember what anything was called so bare with me. (I will provide pictures!)  My boyfriend got a HUGE steak with a chimichurri sauce drizzled on the top and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was the perfect medium rare and the chimichurri was tangy, garlic-y, and yummmmyyy.   I had the pork chops that had some sort of fig reduction and a blue cheese crust with a sprig of rosemary and mashed potatoes. This dish was a huge explosion of flavor! Although I was hesitant to get the pork chops (almost every restaurant I have ever been to has overcooked them) these pork chops were moist and cooked perfectly! My mouth is literally watering just thinking of them.............  We shared an order of truffle Mac N' Cheese and although it was pretty effing good, it was a little too truffle-y?  Then for dessert, we opted for their freshly baked donuts that come with a white chocolate and caramel sauce. These are SO good that on a different night after, we ordered them to go. JUST THE DONUTS. I called in and was a little embarrassed just calling in for donuts to go but the lady on the other line just giggled and said they get that all the time, so I felt better :D They're THAT good, people!  The whole experience was pretty awesome. The service was great. Our waiter was very knowledgable of both the drink and food menus. He came by a few times to check in on us and even recommended the steak that my bf eventually got. I like the romantic ambience, the only thing I don't like about it is where it's located. The *little* parking is in the front of the restaurant but on a busy night, i can see people having to park in the adjacent parking lots. Not a big deal. Wouldn't keep us away.",

Cocktails are regular price. I sat there for a while waiting for the rest of the party to get there, in the meantime I had a beer and water. After we ordered it took forever for our bread to come out, albeit it was very good, but why couldn't the server brought it out earlier?  I ordered the ribeye and so did the rest of the group, we compared steaks as we all had pretty fatty and grisly steaks and couldn't tell what we were cutting into as it was so dark. For the price they were charging, I expected a better quality meat. However, the steaks were cooked properly.   Service was fantastic, there was no smoking, and no casino noise. However, I am going to try the filet mignon next $17 for happy hour).",

Of course we still ordered cocktails. I had the Ward Eight which was a great balance between tart and sweet with a tad more tart.  We started with the calamari appetizer. It included peppers, and had a very light breeding with a house aioli and crispy prosciutto on top.   For my main course, I ordered the rib-eye.  Of course the cut was way too big (18oz), but I can't help myself...rib-eyes are my favorite! I ordered it medium, and it was slightly overcooked.  Still good though.  Then I got the jalapeno creamed corn and it was delicious. Although, I would have loved more if they used fresh corn instead of frozen.   Lastly, when I was about to bust, and 75% of the appetizer, 50% of the steak, and 50% of the side were all in togos, they brought out the complimentary doughnuts. I am not a big sweets eater, but I couldn't resist and popped two of the tiny holes in my mouth.  They were very good, but if I even ate one more hole, I would pop.  My friend loved them, and the two dips and even took them home.   It's a little pricey here, but I will be back...the next time during happy hour for half priced steaks!",

Steaks 1/2 off were simply decadent. Brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had. I asked the bartender to make my drink with a tequila base since drink menu was too overwhelming for me to make a decision. My cocktail was as good as my food, refreshing and decadent! Just when I thought I'd gone to heaven, we ordered the bread pudding. My husband and I both agreed it was the best dessert we have had in a while! Service excellent. Atmosphere perfect. Can't wait to back!",

    "text": "Came for the half-price steaks during happy hour.  I actually liked the food I got quite a lot.  My salad was fresh and plentiful, the asparagus that came with my steak was deliciously seasoned and grilled just right.  The steak was a nice size, cooked a bit more well-done than I ordered (I'd asked for M.R., got Med.), was very tasty nonetheless.  My friend didn't fare as well, as his Filet was definitely over-done, but still flavorful. He, too, enjoyed his salad quite a lot.  I had water with my meal, as their wine is too expensive, and we'd had a couple elsewhere, anyway.  My three-star verdict is based on three things: four-star food, almost-four-star service, and two-star honesty.  The half-price steaks are a big gimmick in the sense that no one in their right mind would pay $42 for the NY Strip I had and be happy about it, and certainly not $59 for the Filet my friend had.  At half-price, they were just about right.  So the take-away is that you should NOT order steak unless it's happy-hour, because you will feel you've been SCREWED.  And by the way, the argument that everybody charges stupid prices for steaks in Vegas doesn't fly, because it's STILL stupid :)",

It is very popular and exceptionally busy during both happy hour times, regular and late night. We were told it's a favorite of locals and those in the service industry. The food was fantastic. Like seriously the whiskey truffle potatoes are one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life: We shared a ribeye and two sides. Steak was cooked perfectly. The cocktails were super unique and well executed. My only complaint was the service. We were seated promptly after checking in for our reservation, but it took maybe 20 minutes for a server to greet us and bring us water. I get that they were busy but that's a bit excessive. Service the rest of the meal wasn't really much better, but the food kind of made up for it!",

No human should ever speak to anyone in the way that Nectaly has to my mom! It is a mind blowing that there is an article about how he was recognized as Bartender of the Year?!?!    My mom took me here on my birthday, she wanted to treat me to a nice steak dinner. Being a person who has dined at some of the top steak house, this place is in the middle. The reason my mom initially complained was out server questioned us sending our over cooked steaks back!!! Seriously, I'm pretty confident I know the difference between medium rare and medium well. It was an insulting moment with our sever.  It's not the service of why I'm giving this place one star (I would have gone back), if I could give it zero I would - I'm giving it a one star review to the owner and how he chooses to respond to his clientele.",

Be prepared to adjust your eyes when you enter. It's super dark and this place gets packed so it's in your best interest to make a reservation prior to arriving or you will be waiting awhile.

The interior is DARK! i almost couldn't see my hand in front of my face but you adjust quickly and can see everything going on around you. We ordered drinks which were amazing and from different eras which made it really fun. Lots of bourbon and gin based drinks but I tried the Henry Wallbanger and it was delicious and had Vodka in it which is always a win in my book :) The boys both got bourbon drinks and we all sampled them and they were really good!! We order a shrimp cocktail and it was full of large shrimp and amazing cocktail sauce. We each ordered a steak... two filets and two new york strip steaks and 4 sides. I loved my filet and then tried hubby's strip steak and fell even more in love!! We ordered Garlic Spinach, Garlic Mash, Truffle Mac N Cheese and Asparagus.... all four were incredible but the asparagus was unreal good!  It was amazing to say the least. The whole experience was top notch!!!",

    "text": "Update - To the person from Herb's and Rhye who responded to my initial review:   First, the purpose of my review was to share my candid experience at your establishment. Instead of responding in the way that you have, the time you took in typing that could have been better used towards training your staff on proper customer service - especially when delivering bad news; as the saying goes, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Although your response did not address my review in a constructive way, I do appreciate that you actually read it.   I could give this place - 4 stars I would. My friend made a reservation for Thursday at 6pm. I arrived at 5:45pm and it took more than 5 mins to find a parking spot. When I walk in almost tripped over the feet of the 4 people waiting for a table. Note that the place is Very dark and your eyes have to adjust when you open the door. Speaking of which, why would they put the chairs so close to the door knowing it'll be hard for those walking in to see them?  About those ladies at the check-in. One was named Gabby and I don't recall the other's name. They had very bad attitudes and rudely told me that i could not sit at the table at 5:51pm that we reserved for 6PM but they would let me sit as it got close to 6PM. The look on my face must've told her how dumb that sounded because the other girl says the waiter wasn't in until 6PM. I wouldn't have minded waiting the NINE minutes under normal circumstances but there was nowhere to sit and standing meant lurking next to people's tables as the tables are very close to the front.  I will never ever again go to that overly packed, dark, no parking having, rude weirdly staffed restaurant as there are too many other decent places in LV to dine.",

Planning from out of town can be scary because you can not actually see the places or taste the food but this restaurant hit it out of the park for us! We had a reservation and requested to sit in the bar area, which they accommodated.   The Restaurant: Do not let the plain exterior and sign trick you. The interior is darkly light with lots of burgundy and black. It has a very lounge type feel. Cozy yet lively - just what a steak house should be.  The Food: Excellent! We ordered the clam appetizer which we all loved (My husband joked that he could drink the broth it was so tasty.) We each ordered a different cut of steak and they were all quite simply - perfect. Tender, flavorful, juicy, and delicious. The side dishes were also top notch - the jalapeno corn and Brussel sprouts were favorites at our table. We were to full to order dessert but they surprised us with a free order of mini donuts to help us celebrate our wedding. Wow- we somehow managed to eat them and were so glad we did - YUM!  The Drinks: So much fun! They have a huge menu of drinks from all different eras. Everything we tried was very good.  The Service: 4 Star. We had two people assigned to our table and we wanted for nothing. They were very accommodating without being intrusive.  Let's just say they earned a very good, much deserved tip from us!  We can not wait to go back next time we are in Vegas. This was the best meal we had all week and with the happy hour prices it was very reasonable for a steak house!",

    "text": "So many moons ago, all my friends told me to try this restaurant out. It took me almost a year to make it there.  On Friday, I called at 7:30 p.m. for a reservation, the hostess said 8:45 p.m., I was fine with that since it was short notice.  I knew I was going to be early, so I already knew I would have a wait.  I arrived about 8:10 p.m., checked in, and the hostess, took us right back to a table for two.   Alycia was our server, and she was very attentive to our needs. As we both were first timers she went through the basics of the menu for us. Gave us a little history lesson about the restaurant.   I ordered the double pork on the bone with mash potatoes. (pictures below), and my friend ordered the Kitchen Sink(also pictured below).  Alycia made it a point to run through the temperature process for me on the pork chops since the closer to the bone will be different.  Two nonalcoholic drinks, and refilled water until we could float.   The food came out hot and fresh. The pork was cooked exactly the way she said it would come out. Very minimal fat and the mash potatoes were very tasty.  The Kitchen Sink was mixed seafood in a red sauce with a kick.  My friend loves spicy food and she loved the sauce and meal.  Her biggest concern was some of the shell based food had small broken shells throughout the sauce which you just need to watch for.   At the of our stay, Val came over to check in on us. Pleasant and personable. She also with some prompting gave us the back story of the restaurant.    The total was 95.00  for two.",

There was a little confusion when I asked to get on the wait list for the bar area (vs. dining room). When we got the text our table was ready we were taken back to the dining room. I asked the hostess about it (I was very polite but specific) and she was annoyed. I apologized for being a hassle and told her to have a great night twice, she totally ignored me both times. Our server and buster were awesome- very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails- super attentive.   Our steaks, sides and apps were really good but even at Happy Hour prices we were out the door for $300 before tip so it's definitely a special occasion spot.",

I ordered the Ribeye, medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, and had enough flavor without any sauce or rub. The garlic Mash was also good, along with the Truffle Mac & Cheese. The Little Neck Clams were also very good, but make sure you dip the bread. It makes all the difference! With so many restaurants in Vegas, it can be hard to stand out, but Herbs and Rye really does! The combination of food quality, service, and happy hour prices, this place stands out. The parking sucks, but everything else makes up for it. Looking forward to my next visit.",

Not in a hurry though.  Maybe they won't be so generous with the salt next time.  ;)",

Leave some room for dessert and have donuts with white chocolate and caramel! Highly recommend this for a group of friends or simply a date!!!",

The atmosphere is very romantic and actually kind reminiscent of a 1930s mob restaurant with the antique chandeliers, satin red wallpaper, and black leather pincushion style chairs. We both had a steak; myself the filet mignon and my fiance with the New York strip. Both were incredibly tender, cooked perfectly to order, and came with great sides. The cocktails are as exquisite as they are literally a piece of Americana with their list being in chronological order from different eras in history. The H&R donuts were an unexpected, but very appreciated gift from the house, but they were absolutely excellent. Imagine miniature donuts in a white chocolate and caramel glaze and sprinkled with just a dash of crack. Yeah, these little guys can't be legal. Allie (I hope I spelled that right!), our server was incredibly friendly and helpful in finding cocktails that hit our respective palates just right and left both of us feeling like we were royalty. However long it takes for us to be back in the Vegas Valley, we will be back to herbs and rye; that's a promise.",

We had the spinach,  jalapeno corn,  button mushrooms,  truffle Mac and cheese,  broccoli and cheddar and they were all great,  mushrooms being the best :)  the ambiance is great totally unexpected for the area and the waiter was fabulous,  we ordered 2 desserts the chocolate chip cookies with ice cream,  which was magical omg and the bread pudding which  was ok....

He was just curious but because it was his birthday, the bartender was nice enough to let him try about 3 different types of scotches. The ambiance is very intimate with the dim and red lighting. Can't wait to go back :)",

They have some pretty awesome classic cocktails here including Moscow mules served in the copper cups and French 75s. The bartenders have a lot of fun crafting these drinks and as a patron I had a lot of fun drinking them.  Misti and I also shared a couple of snacks to offset the liquor including a big mixed green salad that had bacon croutons. Um, yum! The other food we had was a Mediterranean flatbread that came with a blended spinach spread instead of tomato sauce, feta cheese, black olives and artichoke hearts. I really like the unique flavors of food and drink at Herbs and Rye so I can see why Misti is such a fan. I'd definitely come back on my next visit to Vegas and try more of what they're offering here.",

My brother and I both got a ribeye, I got mine blue cheese and bacon crusted at a medium rare temp. IT WAS fantastic. We also started off with the calamari like usual and of course it was as good as always. Every time I come to H&R it's a great experience. I tell all my friends. It's also one of the best happy hour deals I've seen. Half off steaks???? What???? It's so satisfying paying $23 for a filet mignon that I would GLADLY spend $46 on. So to wrap up this review, Aly is amazing and I'll probably start requesting her when I come in.",

The bartenders were ready to serve us as soon as we parked our batooki's on the bar stools.   I personally ended up ordering the stake salad flatbread, which was divine and  a glass of chardonnay that was not such a great recommendation from the B-tend, but it was still good enough for me to drink it up. My buds had 4 french beers between them and calamari.    Overall the bill for 1 glass of wine, 4 beers, calamari + 1 flat bread was $70 tip not included in calculation which is a little steep, but I thought it was worth it because the aesthetics made it feel like it was worth spending the extra green. The food did take a bit long to arrive, but it was no biggie. I definitely dig this joint and will be coming back real soon.",

    "text": "LOCAL GEM of Las Vegas!  The atmosphere is dark but yet inviting; somewhat like an old speak easy; w/ familiar music that plays in the background. Great place to hang out!  OPEN: Monday - Saturday 5pm to 3am. Closed Sunday. HAPPY HOUR: 5pm - 8pm & 12am - 3am every day.  (50% OFF items w/ 2 stars on the menu (Steaks, Appetizers..etc); and DISCOUNTS on well drinks)  FOOD is on POINT! Steaks are tender, juicy and flavorful. If you like a little kick, add the Herbs and Rye rub. Well worth it! We also ordered different sides to share; mac n cheese, garlic spinach, asparagus, sweet potato tots and the jalapeno corn. Side dishes have great flavor and all so good! So get what you feel like, you wont be disappointed. . DRINKS - At first glance, the cocktail menu is organized by era, which was very intriguing. I ordered the 'Last Word' a drink from the Prohibition era. It was intense, slightly sweet w/ a citrus kick! Not for the faint-of-heart, but very delicious!  What's GREAT about the drinks here!? The bartender's are mixologist; very professional and know there stuff! If nothing strikes you on the bar menu; tell the bartender what sort of drink you like, and they'll concoct something new and delicious for you.   Overall the food quality, attractive atmosphere and DRINKS are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!

The place is a little ways off the strip and has a small parking lot so I would suggest an Uber or Lyft getting here.   Has a nice decor but be warned that it is pretty dark throughout the whole establishment. Would prefer it to be a little brighter in the dinning area. This place is known for their craft cocktails. I ordered a Blantons neat since I can rarely find it these days.  Others in the party ordered the house red which was actually pretty good. They also have Pepsi not coke.   For apps we had the carpaccio which was quite delicious the meat melted in your mouth and had great seasoning. Caesar salad portion was huge and easily shared between 2 people.    The steaks ordered were the filets.  Some with blue cheese crust and some with fried egg. I had the surf and turf. Everyone else said their steaks were cooked well, but mine came out a little tough/ over cooked for med rare. The lobster as well was over cooked and dry.   Service was good overall. Great place to visit when you come to Vegas. HH have 1/2 steaks but it's hard to get reservations during that time so book ahead if you know you're gonna be in town. Wish my meal was cooked better but everyone else had a great meal.",

We were directed by a friendly wait staff and sat down a a wonderful clean table right on time for the reservation. I had the New York strip with a blue cheese crust and garlic spinach. Perfectly cooked and absolutely amazing. Great steakhouse vibes and a lovely time. Will definitely be coming back for a happy hour.",

Calamari was under cooked and tough, breading was falling off. had prosciutto and banana peppers on it. sauce was delicious  The ribeye was cooked perfectly and had lovely grill marks. it was seasoned well and had good flavor.   Bourbon potatoes had a very strong garlic flavor. like eating raw garlic.   Mac and cheese was okay. pasta wasn't drained so every time a bite is taken, the flavor is watered down.  Brussels sprouts were very good. they were cooked perfectly and the bacon was delicious.   Over all, I'm not sure what the fuss about this place is. with so many steak choices in Las Vegas, this place definitely falls short on execution. it feels like a home cook who watches Food network.   I think my biggest problem with this place is that nobody asked why we didn't eat more than one or two bites of each of our dishes. Clearly they don't care about your experience and are riding the misguided buzz.",

The wedge salad was great with dressing and pork belly esq bacon.  Service is very very good - perhaps best off strip i have experienced - well oiled teams - friendly & professional.  Draw back - if you do not go at happy hour, the steaks would not be worth the price.  we tried the New York and Filet - both good but not tbe quality of meat you would expect for $44 or $56 respectively at other steakhouse in town- but for $22 & $28 perfectly acceptable since they also came with a side dish.  happy hour is 5pm to 8pm and 12am to 3am the steak topping looked good and i had the blue cheese crust and bacon and well woth the $6.50 up charge.  Will definately go back but during happy hour. would also of like to see tbone or porterhouse on the menu",

It was fortunate we found a spot as one person left.  We heard rave reviews about this place, especially their half-off happy hour deals. Happy hour is from 5-8pm (I believe) and after midnight. We just made it before 8pm. We wanted to get the 60-oz King Kong Ribeye which normally costs $190. Two friends bailed on us, so we just had it all to ourselves. And mussels. The ribeye was actually more chewy than I expected, even at medium rare. That was disappointing. Of note, when we had the ribeye leftovers the next day, it was more tender after microwaved. Good to try the humongous ribeye but probably wouldn't come back.",

Its the place to be for HH or even a late night HH.   Let's start with the service, because I really don't think you'll find a group of people more willing to take care of you or entertain you in one place. I always head to the bar because the bartenders here are the coolest bunch of bartenders in the city. Very laid back and willing to get you whatever it is. Within means of course.   Food. FOOD. F-O-O-D! So bloody phenomenal, you cannot go wrong with any of their dishes. The last time I went and met up with a friend, he had to leave early. I told him to leave me there. I wanted to try their dessert. Sadly he did not....Even more unfortunate I had to leave with him. He owes me. Their HH gives you half off their steaks. Yes you read that right...HALF OFF STEAKS.   Drinks....ok. If you look at their drink menu and order off of it, you will leave feeling like a drink aficionado. At least that's how I feel haha. They have drinks from various times of history and they are put together with finesse like old school Vegas probably did back in the day.   Atmosphere, dark and can get loud. They play music from the vinyl days and its makes for a better environment because you'll hear people singing along to the tunes while having conversations. Ok, ok. That's just me. Anyways, this place is a great staple of Vegas and I enjoy it immensely.",

Clients always looked shocked when I say \"midnight happy hour!\" I be like: that's what you get for waking up in Vegas =)  Sure they HH is bomb but, my favorite thing on their menu isn't even on HH. Of course, right lol Their pork chop is SO BOMB with the mash and topped with jelly. I, normally, don't even like pork chops!  Not only is the food good but, they have great bartenders/mixologists. It's a speakeasy type place so you know they have those unique specialty cocktails.  Great place for dates, dinner, and friends!",

We had half off everything on the menu.The drinks were cheap during happy hour. We had the calamari, flatbread pizza, gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. They were all tasty. They had other things on the menu but was too full to order any more. I would have to come back here and check out  the food again. Not a bad place.",

The food is always amazing, the steak is so delicious. we first ordered the caprese salad, which was amazing but the size was too small for us, so we also ordered the spicy steamed mussels. The mussles were amazing!! it was a huge pot, I would even recommened ordering it as your entree if you wanted seafood. I ordered steak of course! The flavor of the meat is so wonderful, they only put a few salt, pepper, and baselmic butter on it when cooking. My personal favorite is the new york strip. It was a perfectly cooked medium steak. the side I picked was the mac and cheese with truffle oil. THIS WAS AMAZING! I would love to have a recipe for this!  The only reason i dont give them 5 stars is all based on the cocktails. I know they are supposed to be known for their cocktails but i personally wasnt a fan. I tried three different kinds and they all seemed to be way to sour for my taste. my face actually hurt from the puckering of my cheeks. I switched to beers lol. I will be back for more though!",

Granted I had the happy hour menu items, so pricing wasn't an issue as those are some good deals, but I could see a dinner getting a little pricey here. Still the service, cocktails, and ambiance make it worth it.  I had the wings and beef carpaccio, the wings were fine good flavors and crispy, but the beef carpaccio was AMAZING, loved every bite. Perfectly thin slices covered in a truffle mayo drizzle on a bed of arugula, sign me up!!  Then I drank a Moscow Mule, the most perfect summer cocktail ever, and the glass it comes in is kind of cool too. I also had the Hemingway daiquiri, also very good but I must say the Mule was my favorite.   The tv's behind the bar were playing TCM's (and 16 candles was on) and the History channel, very entertaining to watch while sipping on some drinks.  Our bartender was the owner, and he couldn't of been nicer, very attentive and still took time to chat up his patrons.  I will definitely be coming back here to enjoy some more cocktails during their amazing happy hour.",

Every time drove past this restaurant the parking lot was always full (around dinner time). That is always a good thing! When we walked up to the building a little after 6pm, the black exterior and windowless building had a speakeasy feel to it. Opening the doors, it definitely reminded me of an older, classy, speakeasy type of restaurant. There are two dinning areas. We were lead into the area which also holds the bar. The bar is 3/4 the length of the building. Opposite the bar are booths. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, dimly lighting the restaurant. While you wait for your dinner to be served they provide you with fresh baked bread and butter. We were lucky enough on out first visit to make happy hour. Which not only meant discounts on liquor it also meant 50% off our steaks. They identify which items can be discounted because of happy hour with a star next to the item. We ordered steaks and they each came with one side dish. In addition we ordered an additional side dish... we needed to try it all! The side dishes are served family style. Our meal was excellent as well as the service. Throughout our meal I noticed that the bar was continuously becoming busier. We left a little before 8pm and the place was still quit busy. I feel like I was the last to know about this lovely whole in the wall restaurant. They are always the best! There is not doubt that we will be going back.    Impressed!",

The lettuce was fresh and they didn't overdo the dressing with the salad. The gnocchi was well cooked and the portion was pretty filling. Oh, not to mention the old school cocktails they offered. They have a whole list of great drinks dating back to the 19th century. Seriously this is probably the best Italian food restaurant off the strip (maybe in the entire city). I have to go back again and try some of the other menu items to be sure.",

I guess im getting old tho & couldnt read the tiny print on the specialty drink menu so couldnt imbide in their cocktails. Great happy hr deals on steaks 5-8 but was shocked by the website menu price difference to actually being there ( u guys need to update ur web menu!!!)  Anyway our server was freakin knowledgable. And superb! Like i said tho food was...meh... Started with steamers and caesar which were good. I gots the porterhouse & my bro got the fillet... Cooked perfectly but no differently than going to the butcher block by my house & throwing it on the grill for 1/4 the price. Sides were asparagus.... Good but salty... Truffle mac n cheese.... Decent but oily... Then the worst garlic mashed potatoes ever! Obviously out the box & a piece of roasted garlic on top of em to make em garlic mashed.... Whaaaatttt? Decent place but doesnt match the reviews... Careful of False yelpers... Been in the industry along time & probably wont be back.... Not horrible but like i said..... Meh!",

LOVE IT!!  bartender was a total cutie old school kinda guy..made some amazing cocktails too!! must try the Pims Cup Cucumber Mint drink! GULP!!!  sides were extra. total for two with one drink each.. including tip $85...  worth that and more due to flavor explosion!! also medium rare was cooked perfect!!  we got there right at 5pm. it was not very busy but full and food wasnt fast but perfectly timed!!!  the outside looks like a crappy night club.. lol.. dont let that fool you.. we will return on our next vegas trip for sure!!!!  one thing im confused on is our waiter said they didnt have any happy hour drink specials..?? WTF?  we ate in the bar in a nice comfy booth!  the music is quite loud which i would have loved if they werent playing the pop Beyonce hip hop .. didnt fit the scene or the customers..",

I have come here with friends about 8 times, hoping each time the service will be better, but no luck. I once waited an hour and 23 minutes for my food. It has become a game for us, how long will it take for a draft beer to come to our table? 32 minutes!! I ordered a steak one night, and was still working on it when the waitress picked it up to take it away. I told her I was not done, and she held the plate for me to eat it out of her hand! I finished my steak with her holding it for me, and she stormed off as if I was an inconvenience for her. Another time we told them we had a group of about 12 people coming, and I was told we are not allowed to have more than 6 people. I looked in the dining room and there was noone in there. I asked if we could push some tables together for our large group and they said no. It's such a shame because their food is amazing and their signature cocktails are delicious. Unfortunately, I will not be going back again.",

It was a Saturday night and I was really looking for a good time that didn't involve...long lines!  Entering the building you are immediately surrounded by brick which is really unique in Las Vegas.  The sound of 90's hip hop was very welcoming!  We greeted the DJ and walked to the old bar that stretched to the back of the building.  On the other side of the bar were these beautiful booths and the wall was covered in a red antique wallpaper.  The wait staff is super friendly!  We had a couple shots and beer on tap.  The price of the shots were a little high but, for beer on tap for $4 wasn't bad at all.  We also ordered french fries.  They were a little pricey and they didn't give you more that an large order of fries from McDonalds.  After 12a they have a happy hour.  I would definitely recommend taking advantage of that cuase it's 50% off.  I give this place 3 out of 5 stars.  We will go again.  I would even love to go here for a birthday celebration.

BUT we cancelled our drinks as they were arriving bc we were finished with dinner and about 15-18 mins had passed from when we placed the 2nd order.  Our party was of 6 which means autograt so that might explain the lack of service. But if she could bump our checks up with a 2nd (maybe 3rd) round of drinks, then her check and autograt would had been higher so still confused on the lacking service. Anyhow we paid and left and as our party was leaving, I asked a different server for the mgr and he said he's the gentleman at the hostess desk with the beard. So I waited at the desk for his return...and I waited...and I waited. I waited so long that I witnessed a party of 4 come and to be seated, never greeted and talked about where they should go instead bc of the lack of service. I waited at least 10 minutes that my group said \"Let's just go\" and since I couldn't speak with him, I'm leaving this long negative review that I wanted to avoid. Herbs & Rye is good and well known. We visit frequent but after our last visit, we won't rush back.",

Sorry, knowing daddy didn't hug someone enough ruins it for me. What else? Club pools? Meh. But...this place. An italian steakhouse mixed with a prohibition cocktail bar. EFF YES. Red velvet walls, dark wood, two happy hours (save HALF OFF MEAT) and some really good dishes. I had the prime, my coworker had the rack of lamb, jalapeno creamed corn, etc. Bomb. The whole place is what I want from Vegas. Top notch.",

I had the \"Remember the Maine\", \"Vieux Carre\", and one more that escapes me. All were fantastic. Then, the food! We ordered during happy hour which means all the steaks are half off.

I tried a bit of the Boulevardier and Remember the Maine and there were also very well made.  I read that bartenders who work on The Strip like to come here for classic well-executed cocktails. I can see why. During our visit, there were also people who were first time visitors there like us.  I'd said that Herbs & Rye is a place where you definitely go for the cocktails, and you can stay for food if you want though not a must. They do have a good happy hour (5-8pm, 12am-2am) with 50% off some items and ALL the steaks. However, the food was not mind blowing. It was good but not outstanding.  Another off-strip place worth visiting for well done cocktails.",

While it was 100 degrees and sunny outside, the restaurant was incredibly dark and had a very old-fashioned Las Vegas saloon vibe.   The menu was quite expansive with the majority of it consisting of drinks. They offer authentic classic cocktails that are worth the trip to the restaurant alone. These bad boys set you back $10 each, but they are worth it. I had the Remember the Main (it was a strong drink since it had Absinthe in it) and a Lion's Tail. These drinks were absolutely delectable and I just wish they were included in the happy hour. I'd be visiting this bar much more often then!  The bf and I split the special that night, a 24 oz porterhouse steak with one side (we picked button mushrooms) for $29. At that price, it was a no brainer. This steak was arguable one of the best steaks I've ever had. It had a gorgeous charred sear on the outside but was deliciously moist and flavorful on the inside. They have options to add on blue cheese or a dry spice rub, but we wanted to enjoy the steak in all it's natural glory. It was absolutely delicious. Both sides we had, button mushrooms and the garlic mash, were great and completed the meal.  For dessert, we split their homemade donuts. I'm not much of a dessert person, but these were incredible. You get both the soft and fluffy donuts and donut holes along with a dark chocolate and white chocolate dipping sauce. These were soooo good.   Both their food and drinks were exceptional and I will definitely be back. Date night seal of approval!",

The atmosphere is like a bar on the 60's like Sinatra times. The lighting is very dark, as a matter of fact too dark to even read the menu. Their drink menu is pretty cool, they have a large variety of unique drinks which illustrate a specific period of time. Some of the time representations were the Prohibition, Gothic , Golden age, etc.  Their speciality is their steaks. During happy hour (every day from 5-8) the steaks and the appetizers are 50% off. We ordered the Kansas City bone-in  which is a good choice if you like the grilled taste. I got the Filet Mignon which was juicy and very tender. The sides were very mediocre. They were something that I could probably do at home with no problem (and I'm not a good cook). We ordered the mac n cheese and the jalapeno corn, and they were equally disappointing. I saw a lot of small plates that look really good, perhaps I would come back and try them instead of the steak. Oh as an FYI, we read on the menu that you cannot share your steak if you buy it during happy hour! Even though we never planned on sharing, it annoys me when an establishment tells you what to do after you are paying for your food!",

    "text": "Quite possibly one of my new favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I came here with two friends on a weekday evening for dinner.   My only complaint was that the lights kept changing for some reason from normal dining atmosphere dimness to really really dark and it was kind of distracting. At one point we even joked and were wondering if we were about to witness a performance. Also parking was kind of annoying and I had to park in a sketchy ally quite a ways down from the building, but it wasn't the end of the world.   I had a moscow mule to drink and it was AMAZING. It is one of my staple drinks and they served it with a ball of very finely crushed ice inside of a copper mug which made it more of a slushee moscow mule, but either way it was amazing.  For dinner I had the pork and figs and it was also amazing. Perfectly cooked and a VERY thick cut of meat. It was served over potatoes.  The service was also really good, and best of all was the happy hour pricing which made what could have easily of been a very expensive dinner, a pretty reasonable one. I cannot wait to go back soon!",

I'm a pretty understanding person, but if you don't have enough staff to serve your customers then maybe it's time to expand a little. Never the less the caprese salad is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Better than mastros or any other restaurant in Vegas. Mac n cheese is also phenomenal. Would definitely come back but maybe at a different time .",

The bad:  Automatic 20% gratuity.  Not a fan of the auto gratuity.  I feel like it makes the wait staff a little lazy since they don't have to worry about good service equaling  a good tip.  We weren't even having dinner items and half our party of six left halfway through the evening.    The ugly.  Our waitress, Debra, doesn't believe in giving back your entire amount of change on the bill,  To me this is sort of stealing.  Not that it was a huge amount but you already got your 20% and I imagine if she did this to us it's probably her common practice and that adds up after a while and that's not cool.",

    "text": "I've been going here for the past few years and yes, it's been consistently lovely. I've taken even a few visitors here for late night eats as it surely beats having graveyard specials at a janky diner. We get to sit in a cozy, dark booth and listen to a really thoughful soundtrack if you like stuff like downtempo.  The main draw is every night from 5pm-8pm and 12am-close is HAPPY HOUR. No, it doesn't include the cocktails, but I believe well drinks and some beers are. The gem of it is the food. There is a limited half off food selection of various types of steaks, a few apps (currently spicy mussels and garlic butter clams), and a entree of linguine and clams.   Get the steak! Its good quality for the price. I normally go with the 18oz ribeye (ends up like $20 at HH) or the Kansas City Bone In 12oz ( I believe $15 during HH) and it's been tender, cooked to the right temperature, and seasoned well that I don't put any steak sauce. It comes with one side and their sides are great here. I really like their truffle mac n cheese, sweet potato tots, or super garlicky spinach. No it isn't your dirt cheap steak special, but you get what you pay for and it's a great value considering the quality. We've brought even the BFs grandma and mom recently and both approved of the steak and would like us to bring them back.    We also get the spicy mussels often during HH. It's a rather large pot they give you for the $11 HH price and the marinara is garlicky, a bit spicy, and needs to be sopped up. Ask for more bread - theirs is delicious, hot out the oven.   They serve some of my favorite consistent drinks. Drinks here don't rotate so much, but are all classic cocktails using a lot of small batch spirits so it speaks to my heart.  The BFs and my drink of choice is the Vieux Carr'e (Rye, Cognac, Benedictine, Sweet Vermouth, Peychauds Bitters, Angostura Bitters) since its just alcohol on top of more alcohol. I just find I like less sweet stuff over the years and just want something unfussy and you can taste the nuances of the alcohol. If I want something tart and refreshing for a change, I go for Blackthorn or Moscow Mules. I find both great for summer. I've also ordered mystery drinks here and have been pleased, whatever I was given. I think at this point they can peg my tastes pretty well. I shockingly haven't drank the entire menu yet (but close) and will report back once I do with a running list of what each drink is like.  I think this place will always have a special little spot in my heart. It was actually the place I met all my Yelp friends, for the first time so it holds special memories. And throughout the years the steaks and the drinks have never disappointed.",

I would have made love to.them if my date didn't wolf them down so fast!  Savory and delicious, the goat cheese was perfect with them.  Ordered steaks of course.  The add on options are great but my Bone In KC was not a great cut.  Much to fatty.  On the other hand, my date got the filet and it would melt in your mouth.  Don't ever get the whipped garlic mash.  Awful.  Just tasted like cheap instant, disappointing.    Drinks?  Oh mama!  Great cocktail menu.  Be brave and branch out or just order a Moscow mule (my favorite).  Bartenders here are obviously pros so be patient, these aren't gin and tonics.  Finally, service was great.  Sever was knowledgeable, helpful and attentive.  We came at a busy time but he still made us feel welcome.  Love this joint.",

    "text": "Went here to have a casual dinner with friends, thinking we would all like to try a new place.  Made dinner reservations for 6:30 the night before, and we honestly got there about 5 minutes late - tight parking in this area around dinner time/Happy Hour when menu items with 2 stars are half-off (mostly meats).  It didn't take us long to be seated at a table after checking in, and we had 1 of our group running late.  The setting is nice, slightly dim for a kinda suave atmosphere. The wait staff is also a good representation of the setting. When I say that, I mean they're really nice and personable, but also know when to give your group space to ease in. Our server Mark (sp.) was not only nice, but he was also knowledgeable about the menu. He told us the background on the meats and his favorite menu items for recommendations. He even threw in a few jokes to jab at our friend for being late, then eating off of us 'cause he had sushi before our get-together. LOL. He managed to get him to order a few drinks. I also have to give him and the bartender kudos for making a drink that wasn't on the menu, but I thought I'd give a shot at asking for. It was an Old Fashion, sour, with brandy and olives. They even made it \"Wisconsin style\" for me 'cause it's common in the Midwest, but uncommon in the West. This is honestly the first place (well stocked and equipped bar) that made that drink right for me. XD Anyway... Food was scrumptious! The Meatballs & Chorizo was yummy with the tomato sauce and Feta cheese. We all ordered the Ribeye with different sides, one was cooked a little too rare for my friend though. For sides, we chose Truffle Mac 'n Cheese, Garlicky Spinach and Brussels Sprouts & Honey Swino. All yummy, but my favorite is the Brussels Sprouts (thinking it's because of the bacon). The sides are in small dishes, so it doesn't come proportionate to the size of the steak unless you'd like to order additional stuff. Ahahaha... Fine by me though 'cause I just had my leftover steak to go and made it for breakfast with eggs and hash browns. For dessert, we had the Bread Pudding with ice cream, and the H&R Doughnuts that comes with 1 caramel and 1 white chocolate sauce. Oh my gah... Don't even ask me which one I liked more 'cause I honestly can't decide. Mark did tell us that the Doughnuts are always a popular item though.  For about 6 drinks, 3 steaks with 1 side each, and 1 appetizer, I think the bill came to around $200-$245 with the gratuity.",

The drinks were not included in the happy hour in the dining area, but I think they may be included at the bar because it was jammed packed.  The waiter chose our drinks for us after we explained a little about what we like. He brought me a Saturn which was citrusy, sweet, and smooth. Really loved it. He brought her a French 75 and it was bubbly and refreshing. We started off with the spicy mussels. They come in a really delicious red sauce and bread. They were pretty good and not too spicy.  We ordered a filet and a ribeye both medium with garlic mash, truffle Mac and cheese, and mushrooms. The steaks were cooked perfectly. So much flavor in each bite. Neither one of us could decide which one was our fav. The sides were great too. Potatoes were nice and creamy. The truffle Mac and cheese had the perfect amount of truffle oil. The mushrooms were sauteed to perfection with a nice wine flavor.  Would highly recommend the place. Next time, we will definitely be trying dessert.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place since I've heard it's a great spot for happy hour. Like most reviews say, you should make reservations before hand.  Our family and I recently went to this location. It took us a while to get an opening spot but we showed up 8:45 when we made the reservation. We had a group of 7. It was squished in the front and the hostess told us to move. We were escorted to the bar, which had ONLY 2-3 seats to accommodate our party. We finally get a table 45 minutes later, RIGHT NEXT TO THE BAR which had little to no room in between the bar stools and our table. Menu is very limited. But I've heard have great deals for happy hour. Restaurant is way too dark that we had to use our phones to see what's on the menu. Food is overly priced for the quality and the taste. I tried a little bit of everyone's food. Some were out of the world while others... not so much. Only 10 fries in truffle fry container for appetizers but a ginormous amount of calimari. The pasta noodles were tough. Gluten Free menu isn't really an option. Serving staff wasn't very friendly. One of our guest was allergic to something they put in her entree. Waiter seemed concerned and said he would ask the chef. He came back and pretty much told her she was crazy. She ended up needing an EPI pen later that night. I know it's always best when the WHOLE entire party orders drinks but not all of us wanted cocktails. The waiter seemed mad that some of us ordered water.  Based on unprofessional service and hut or miss food,  I don't think I'll ever come back.",

Our waiter was incredible,  always attentive and the food..(I ordered the same thing I did before, the surf n turf steak and lobster) Phenomenal!!

I normally go during their happy hour for half off steaks. That's normally from 5pm-8pm. These times are normally  busy. They always have a full house so I suggest making reservations ahead of time. I recommend making a reservation for Friday and Saturdays two or three days ahead of time to get a spot during happy hour. Otherwise, you'll be waiting there for hours to get seated.   My go to is the ribeye cooked rare. It's so tender and juicy! My favorite side include the jalapeno corn and the garlic spinach. The mashed potatoes is also delicious.   But you know what makes the experience top notch is our favorite server Mark! This guy's level of service is top notch! He pronounced our names correctly plus remembered it the next time we came. We'll keep having to try to get a table with him.   I recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a great steak paired with great service.",

The steaks are of good quality and done properly. They are not the best steaks ever, but worth the discounted price.  There are no prices on the drink menu, but we were told that all of their cocktails range from $10-12. Drinks are interesting and well made.

We ordered some cocktail (lions tail) which was Jameson based and tiger eye (spicy drink). They were both off the wall. Any cocktail ever made can be found at herbs and rye. Our main entrees were white wine clam linguine  and filet mignon with smothered potatoes and truffle mac' n' cheese. Linguine had a very nice, fresh, and creamy taste.

    "text": "This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. It is located about 2 miles from the hustle and bustle of the strip.  The restaurant probably won't catch your eye from the outside, but once you step inside it is like you stepped back in time. The dimly lit restaurant is reminiscent of old Las Vegas with it's dark upholstered booths and red wall paper. The combination of 1940s swing music and Frank Sinatra classics complete the feel.  TIP: happy hour is every day from 5 to 8pm. This includes drink specials as well as 50% off every steak.  One of my favorite things about Herbs and Rye is the drink menu. It highlights between four to six drinks from different eras over the past few hundred years in America. These drinks were invented during those time periods and the menu explains who invented it and where. I've sampled quite a few of the drinks and my favorite is the Bee's Knees which is a gin drink. The tiki drinks from the 1960s era is also a favorite and they are served in tiki glasses. All cocktails from this menu are $12 and the tiki drinks are $14.  The dinner menu features a few appetizers and salads but the main draw is the steaks. Every steak comes with one side. The sides are big enough to share. My go to meal is the filet mignon with a side of the truffle Mac and cheese. The steak is phenomenal but the Mac is the best I've ever had.  Herbs and Rye is perfect for a romantic date night or night out with friends. Do make a reservation several days in advance.",

Maybe I should login in more often on Yelp so I can see if there are responses to my reviews. :P   Don't give any bad reviews for Herbs & Rye, folks, the owner might have a temper tantrum like a 3yo.   Don't belittle your customers. If your food sucks, it sucks. If your customer service sucks, it sucks. And judging by you, the \"owner\" and all your responses to bad reviews on here, you suck, therefore your establishment sucks. So totally unprofessional and you should be completely embarrassed of yourself for the comments you make in public.  Lastly, all I did was make a phone call to make reservations (read my review), so I have no clue you were talking about. Makes you look like a total tool. Sad.",

I understand if you want to create the appearance of a busy restaurant by overbooking but to me customer service is more important. I guess the owner could care less about actually providing a decent service or experience. Some people only care about money and having a FAT wallet.  Will not come back.  FYI: Sad that an owner of an establishment would respond in such ways. Instead of fixing the problem, you force clients to leave your business.",

    "text": "Happy hour 5-8pm. Half off three apps and their steaks. The ribeye is normally $63, and then it's only 31.50. What a steal!   We came for a work function. Celebrating meeting our goals and winning team of the month.   The server was extremely patient, detail oriented and friendly. She made recommendations for each steak, such as toppings and sides that went well.   The appetizers, clams and bruschetta was tasty and came out very quick. The clams was paired with bread in a delicious seafood broth. It was far from fishy. The bruschetta was great.   We enjoyed our meal until our entrees came out cold. 4/6 were Lukewarm and not up to standards. Of course they immediately said they would make us new steaks. 45 minutes later we got them again and they were still cold. My ribeye of course was perfect the first time, medium rare and theirs were the ones messed up.   Loved the sides. Asparagus in a garlic butter sauce, with so much flavor. Creamed spinach, not too creamy or thick. Loved that it wasn't full of cheesy flavor instead it was spinach. Mac n cheese was creamy, cheesy goodness, packed with a bit of a crunch. The cast iron containers for the sides are perfect at keeping them hot.   My manager was curious, especially because we couldn't all eat together. My coworker and I ate ours first, then when the others came out 45 minutes later they ate. We asked to speak with a manager. I told her that I was the one who recommended this place and I had heard nothing but great reviews and was disappointed we couldn't all eat at the same time. She made things right by sending us over the desert menu and stating she would take care of that. Stating that way we all can eat together dessert to make up for the inconvenience. I thought that was really sweet and creative to address my managers concern.   For desert I got the Apple Carmel bread pudding. Wow! It's big enough for three people.   Overall I loved the food, the experience, the romantic private ambiance and the managers way at handling a difficult situation.",

The spicy mussels are soooo good I find myself wanting to drink the broth. Even their simple items are delicious. Let me tell you I hate tomatoes and dislike capers but for some reason I'm addicted to their bruschetta flatbread which has both! The way they sear they steaks you'd think Gordon was back there cooking. I have no complaints. Service is awesome too. The servers always remember me & my boyfriend which is pretty cool.",

    "text": "A year ago, my boyfriend and his friends dined here and could not stop raving about their experience. They called Herbs & Rye's steal the best steak they have ever had. One year later, we finally had the chance to see what they were talking about.  From the outside, it looked like an unassuming building off the strip. As we walked in, I was surprised at how beautiful the place was with the red walls, dark lighting and the old school steakhouse vibe.   We started our meal with calamari and it did not disappoint. The banana peppers were a nice touch and the calamari itself was perfectly cooked. I had to stop myself from finishing the whole dish so I can save my appetite for the steak. My sister and I split the 18 oz ribeye ($62) which I'm glad we did because it was a big portion that neither of us would have been able to take home. It was good, but honestly not the best steak I have ever had. It may have been our fault for picking medium well, but I have had better medium well ribeye steaks someplace else. The side of jalapeno creamed corn was amazing, and the mashed potatoes were perfectly made. I ordered the Herbs & Rye spice rub and absolutely hated it as I am not a huge fan of cumin.   The service was amazing and our server went above and beyond to give all twelve of us the best dining experience. I feel like the best time to eat here is during happy hour, where steaks are half the price. I can't confidently say it's worth the hundreds of dollars we spent however, I still recommend this restaurant and see myself coming back whenever I'm in Vegas.",

The place was buzzing! There just so happened to be one seat saved for me at the bar. Perfect spot !  I ordered the \"whole kitchen sink\". I only have any knowledge of this from previous Yelp reviews and photos, I did not see this item on the menu. But it is seafood lovers' dream. I initially asked for some pasta of some sort and the bartender literally begged me not to order it. It was the right choice. This dish is huge , filling, and flavorful. It features every type of seafood and fish that you can imagine.  I put in major work on this dish ! Nearly finishing!  My friend ordered a huge steak and was also unable to finish (half off all steaks on happy hour) . He loved his food!    The vibe of this place is so different from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas, I readily recommend that if you're visiting to please check out this restaurant off the beaten path.   One of my other favorite restaurants is owned by the same people called Cleaver. I have a review for them as well!",

And its half off certain steaks and some other menu item! Luckily I came right at 5pm and was able to seat our party.  So I ordered the 18oz Ribeye medium rare and added a side of truffle mac and cheese and an addition of the bacon. Everything was amazing and made perfectly. The steak was flavorful and juicy. Anything with truffles or bacon are of course always delicious. For the size of the steak and the amount you pay for it, you're getting an amazing deal. I could not finish my meal and leftovers are always such a saving grace when your'e hungry later haha. Service was amazing, but the only thing I would mention is that the lighting was a little too dim for me and had to use my phone a lot to see the menu. But 5 stars anyway! I've already recommended this place to friends who also love it!",

Once the door slammed behind us, we couldn't even see the receptionist, we just heard her talking lol. The husband almost had to pull out his phone for light as we didn't know where we were going lol   Luckily for us, our server Ronnie has been extremely delightful that he made our entrance experience totally forgettable. We mostly rely on his recommendations as well as what we read on yelp to come up with our orders.   I ordered the filet mignon and it did not disappoint at all. It was moist and very tasty. I also ordered the Peruvian sauce to go along with it but I realized, it was really unnecessary as the steak was perfect by itself. So based on others yelp reviews, I ordered both the truffle Mac and cheese as well as the garlic mash and to be honest, I like the garlic mash a lot better. I felt that the Mac and cheese needed a little more seasoning.   For appetizer, we actually got the clams and sauce was just creamy and delicious. I couldn't stop dipping my bread on it lol   We came here for happy hour on a Friday night and man, it was packed! Good thing we came a little early that we got a nice booth to ourselves. Downside of it is that it was by the bar thus, very loud and crowded towards the end of our dinner.   Ronnie treat us to a little dessert on the house as it was our anniversary. Thank you Ronnie! I totally forgot what they're called, those tiny donuts with caramel sauce on the side and they're just heavenly!   Overall, I had a really great experience here. Service was impeccable and food was amazingly delicious! I wish I could give it a full five...maybe on my next visit I'll avoid the bar area and be more prepared for the dimness inside.",

But really that's where the good news stops. The food is lackluster from the simple and uninspired plain bread and butter to the Caesar salad to the overcooked and dry pork chops and NY strip steak. Yes the meat is half price before 8 but that just makes the disappointing food feel slightly less painful. I would rather pay full price for a pork chop that was juicy and tender.  It's good to create environment that transports you back in time but it would be nice if the establishment realized that the culinary world has come a long way since then and bring a higher level of game.   Come for cocktails and dessert if that's what you want but I'd go somewhere else for dinner.",

I ordered the rib eye Steak & Lobster & he ordered the ribeye. We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I got the blue cheese crust which I love.

However, when you walk inside Herbs & Rye, it's a treasured gym. This place has a very cozy, chill, hipster, speak-easy environment that is a hit with the Las Vegas locals.   Customer Service: I loved every single person that I had the pleasure of meeting at Herbs & Rye. They are so friendly, and authentic. The interaction with the team there doesn't feel transactional at all. You will leave Herbs & Rye feeling as though you've known the staff a long time.   Food: Everything on the Menu is worth trying once, twice, or even more. My go to food items to get on the menu is the New York Strip Steak w/ Truffle Mac & Cheese. The steak is prepared better than some of the expensive steakhouses that I've been to.   I must say that Herbs & Rye is another one of my favorite restaurants in the Las Vegas area. If you're in the area and you're looking for a great restaurant off the strip, please check out this local gem.",

So last night food was phenomenal, hands down best surf and turf I've ever had. My only problem is with service. My coworker and I were sitting at the bar and while our drinks were sitting empty for a while everybody else around us at the bar was being asked do they need a refill except for us. It's not like we were being loud, drunk,  rude, or any of that, it's just we went on ignored. The bartender gave us menu but never came around to take our orders, although he did seem very interested in talking everybody else around the bar. I mean you only have to work for tips right?",

    "text": "I have been to Herbs & Rye on several occasions, sometimes to eat, sometimes to drink, and sometimes to do both.  It is one of my favorite bars and one of my favorite steakhouses in the city.  If you arrive after midnight, the steaks are half price, which is one of the best deals I've found in the city.    As a restaurant, Herbs & Rye consistently cooks their steaks to perfection.  They offer additions and sauces to the steaks.  However, I think the steaks are so well cooked, they are best left as is.  The side dishes are good, but I have not found any that are great.  The service is often slow, but I feel that corresponds to the speak-easy atmosphere.  The bar features a long list of prohibition cocktails.  I typically try a new drink each time I visit and I've enjoyed every drink I've ordered.    I especially enjoy the speak-easy decor, which is a nice break from the typical bars on the strip.    If you are looking for a great steak and cocktail in a cool atmosphere, this is the spot to go to.  If you are looking for an amazing deal on great steaks, come after midnight and enjoy!",

I let it cool and the first bite was so delicious, decadent and a tiny spicy. It's listed in appetizers but it's a meal in it self!  I've been coming here for years. I keep coming back. The steaks are always perfect, very consistent. I ordered the filet mignon. Medium rare. My favorite side is the garlic spinach.   Happy hour is 5-8pm, then 12-3am, items with the star are half off.    Oh and I also love Pimm's  Cup, so refreshing for spring or summer.",

People were lined up at the door at 5pm when they open but was able to walk right in a be seated with a 5pm reservation.  Decided to share the ribeye with blue cheese and bacon crust, jalapeno cream corn, mac n cheese, sprouts and swine. Everything came out within about 15/20min. Couldn't even finish all that food with a partner!  Staff was abundant and kept checking on us throughout the meal.  Steaks are half off during happy hour so bill came to about $67 which I thought was a great deal.  Must try!!",

Our last visit was the last straw.   Not only was the meat severely over cooked, dry and bad tasting but we literally could not make it through our meal because the smell of raw sewage coming out of the bathrooms was nauseating. This place really needs to close down, at this point it's pretty clear the owner cares more for his other restaurant cleaver and has thrown in the towel over at herbs and rye. At least the old manager tried to make the best out of a bad situation, he was the reason most people kept coming back, but now without him the place is a disaster. To be charged over $100 and not even eat our meal because of the rancid smells invading the bar in infuriating. Management doesn't care! Dirty dining needs to look into this place! GROSS!!!",

Ordered the 18oz ribeye and it was amazing, definitely one to share among 2 people! Steak was super tender and juicy. Side dishes are very reasonably priced as one side is included with a steak, and you can choose to add more. Ordered the parmesan truffle fries and the mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was good but nothing over the top. Ambience is relaxing with a soft background of great music.   Didn't get to try any drinks but they have such a wide variety on their menu. Parking is scarce, so prepare ahead. Overall, a must try for great steak at such a great price!",

It's really hard to score a decent dinner spot with decent dinner time on the strip without booking months in advance. So it was my job to look up dinner places and I came across this place thanks to Yelp! From the reviews, its also another local favorite spot so we knew we had to give it a try.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the cool ambience of this place! They have happy hour everyday, half off steak before 8PM. My colleagues and I each ordered the ribeye (medium-rare) which btw came with one free sides, so we opted for the sweet potato tots, steamed asparagus and jalapeno cream corn. The sides were amazing, I would highly recommend the sweet potato tots! Now about the steak, it was really tough, like I felt I had to really dig my knife into it to cut off a piece. I am so glad we paid half price because I would totally be piss if I paid $64 for what we got. Then again, I wonder if they quality of the steak during happy hour is different from regular hours. JK, that's just a joke my coworkers and I had.  Overall, I wish I could give a higher rating because our server was a rock star, sides and the drinks were good but the steak was pretty bad.",

    "text": "Were you around during Prohibition and do you miss the drinks of that era? The answer is most likely no, since you'd have to be in your eighties or nineties to remember it and I don't think anyone that age reads my blog. If you never had the chance to experience the drinks popular during prohibition and would like to, however, I suggest you go to Herbs and Rye. Not for the food (definitely not for the food), but for the drinks, which are terrific. In fact, you're not limited to drinks that were popular during Prohibition, but can enjoy the whole American history of drinking from the \"Gothic Age of American Drinking\" (1775-1865) to it's \"Revival\" (1990-present). No matter what you choose I'm sure you'll be happy. I've tried three, the Frisco from the Gothic Age (I don't even like whiskey), the Scofflaw from Prohibition (I don't like bitters), and the Diablo from the Reform years (gotta love tequila). Each has been exceptional, but I don't review cocktails, I review food.  My husband and I have now been to Herbs and Rye three times. We were disappointed the first time, somewhat less disappointed the second. In fact, we walked out after drinks and calamari the first time when we were with my parents because it took forever to not get our food. You might be asking yourself, \"Why would you go back a second time, let alone a third time ?\" Well, there are several reasons.  1) We had been anticipating the opening of a new restaurant ever since they closed and we saw a new sign go up (though, that's really just a reason to try it a first time, I suppose). 2) Every new restaurant deserves a chance to work out the kinks. 3) It's close to home. 4) We hadn't yet had a chance to try their 50% off happy hour, and 50% off food is great way to get you back in the door. (5-7PM and late night, M-F)  The meal always starts out fine. The drinks, as I mentioned, are spot on, and the bread is good, made all the better by sweet honey butter. The servers are pleasant, but then you order, and you wait...and wait. I understand the time it takes to make the cocktails (browns stirred, whites shaken) but there is no excuse for the food taking so long when there are a maximum of two other tables. The calamari ($7.50 with happy hour, pictured above) this time was much better than the first, so I was glad to see the improvement. The idea was good (peperoncini, crispy pancetta, and aoli drizzle) but somehow it ended up as a fairly uninteresting salty mass. Perhaps I am being too harsh. It wasn't so bad, and the portion was large, if you like that kind of thing. I suppose the most disappointing aspect was that it was a vast improvement. A long while after it left our table we got our Vitello a la Fiorentina, a veal T-bone ($18 with happy hour), which wasn't a T-bone at all. Our waiter admitted he had forgotten to tell us that the chef had changed it to a chop, which would have been fine if it was good, but it wasn't. Although it was cooked well, I don't think we were able to get more than six decent bites out of it that weren't ultra-fatty between the two of us. The mashed potatoes underneath weren't hot and didn't have enough butter, and the asparagus was completely void of seasoning. Forget about the \"caramelized lemon\" and white bean ragout, if you can even call it that. If we'd been paying the full price of $36 I definitely would have complained. What am I saying? I complained anyway. The chef took it off the bill, almost making me feel bad for being so negative in this review. Alas, a critic's job isn't always an easy one.  The chef truly isn't the only one to blame for the imminent demise of this restaurant, however, the decorator is. The dining room is supposed to make you feel like you are in old Vegas, but falls short in every way. The red felt wallpaper, fake leather booths, tiny chandeliers, cheap silverware and fake bookcases all add to the depressing ambiance. The worst, above all, is the music. It is more outdated than the drinks and is truly nauseating. I mean, I'm sure \"Suwannee River\" had it's day but it's 2010 now. Ian put it well. \"I think I'm going to slit my throat with this butter knife if I have to listen to this anymore.\" \"Wait!,\" I said, \"Let me finish that honey butter first.\"  Overall, I'm not sure the 50% off menu even makes it worth coming here. I would truly like to see this restaurant continue to make improvements because they have a really great thing going with the bar. It would have been smarter of them to open up a much smaller place that focused on great drinks and served a few exceptional tapas, rather than investing $1.6 million in this huge, boring place (the young new owner unfortunately invested everything he had). My suggestion is to stay in the bar and order the drinks. Order lots of drinks, that way the music probably won't bother you as much. Who knows, you may even start singing along.",

Sides that we ordered w/ our meals were meh as well. Asparagus had no flavor, jalapeno creamed corn was cold, cheddar broccoli was gross - was like cheese whiz melted on broccoli. Since 2 of us share a steak we opted to add another additional side of sweet potato tator tots - seriously $7 for those things? Not worth it. Mind you we didn't add the (for more $$) marshmallow crap on top (it's gross anyway) but no plain sweet potato tator tots are worth $7. The best sweet potato tator tots I've had in this town were @ BB Kings which is unfortunately closed. I will give a proper shout out for the little neck clams. They were great in the garlic white wine broth. Got extra bread to soak up all the great juice (btw - had to has 2 times to get the bread finally the bus boy was the one that brought it to us) Bill was $249 (before tip) for 5 people @ happy hour time & 2 of us even split a steak. There are no drink specials on their \"specialty\" cocktails. They are $10 apiece but says that nowhere in the menu & waiter doesn't mention the price. They need to hire more waitstaff to take care of patrons as everything took forever like I said I waited there before & it's never taken as long as it did on this visit. I noticed that other tables were getting frustrated as well. Was overall disappointed  with this visit to Herbs & Rye. I used to tout this place to everyone but I will be rethinking it now.",

    "text": "You step in off Sahara Avenue. It's late afternoon, 5:30 pm. The stark contrast between daylight and the darkness in Herbs & Rye temporarily hurts the eyes and causes you to see total darkness for a few seconds after the door shuts quietly behind you, escorting you into a lush experience as your eyes adjust to the light levels and you see the colorful yet subdued sprawling bar and restaurant. Dark woods, candlelight, think old Vegas, where the locals might hang out. Or those who go for a menu that is more drink than meal. Definitely more substance than fluff.  Happy hour is from 5-8 pm (and I think 12-3 am) with half off most cuts of beef and 50% off house wines and a few other things.   The house wine (Dark Horse) was very good for a by-the-glass reasonable option and I had two glasses. My husband had a glass of champagne and thought it a bit sweet - he would have ordered more had there been a larger selection and a definitive brut.  My husband loved his steak, the 18 oz ribeye. It was so big he took half of it to go and it was done so perfectly that he was able to reheat it and it was still mildly medium rare the next day for lunch. Touche!  I am a vegetarian but I looked at the menu before we arrived and I knew what I'd order: tomato bisque soup and the brussels sprouts. The soup was spectacular and the sprouts were delicious.  We will be back the next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "Last week, found out this is one of the kids' favorite restaurants... mainly for the bargains during Happy Hour...  On the menu...  House Beer (***) The waiter initially described their Beer... \"Red, like Killian's\". Reponded... \"Killian's Irish Red???\". \"Oops! Excuse me! It's only Red... doesn't taste like Killian's.\"  Yes, the House Beer is Red... He was right... no way did it taste like Killian's.  Littleneck Clams Appetizer (*** 1/2 $11.00 Happy Hour Reg-$22) Parmigiano, Lemon, Broth.   Smallish Clams in a... watery Broth. Frankly, could have used more Butter... a lot more. Had better last year... somewhere else in Vegas...  Bread & Butter (**) I'm a Dipper, an expert Dipper from way back... Love to Dip Bread & Butter in Broth from the Clams Appetizer and from my daughter's Linguine & Clams entree. At first EVERYONE received their own individual six-inch mini-loaf of hard, over-baked Bread. Asked for refills... only two were brought out. Asked for refills again for just me, which the waiter didn't know... only received one loaf. I'll bet if I asked again... we would have been ignored...  Kansas City Strip Steak (** 1/2 $14.50 Happy Hour Reg-$29) Chose this Steak over the Filet... mainly because of the price and size, which was 12oz... the Filet was $34, but was only 8oz. Chose the Jalapeno Cream Corn as a side. Wanted to take it easy on the kids' wallet...  When the entree came out... The Strip Steak was on a separate plate, which surprised me... and the Side of Jalapeno Cream Corn (which was Not Creamed!) was in it's own deep-oval dish almost as long as the plate itself.  Steak, itself, was the thin, smallish Steaks you'd buy for yourself at the local Super-Market... the one's that are gristly, and that you'd always over-cook... never can get right because it's so thin. Hate to say this... the best part of the meal... the watery Jalapeno (Creamed) Corn.  Also received donations of....     Filet Mignon (**** 1/2) Word to Yelpers.... the ONLY Steak worth it's        price regardless whether it's Happy Hour or not is the Filet Mignon at        $34. $17, during Happy Hour, is an absolute bargain!     Linguine & Clams (*** 1/2) Used the same Broth as the Clam Appetizer.       Same conclusion... more BUTTER, PLEASE!     side of Truffle Mac & Cheese (***) Tasted OK... if you ignore the        over-cooked Macaroni!     Looks like I ordered the wrong things... all the way around!  Bee's Knees (* 1/2) Hand-Crafted Cocktails? They might be Hand-Crafted... but not by a qualified Barttender! NOT!  When the drink, which consisted of Gin, Honey & Lemon came out, there was the thin film of dark Honey on top over the light-colored Gin & Lemon Juice which indicated inadequate mixing of the beverage - minimum 30 seconds of continuous shaking, stirring, mixing... whatever. Very amateurish attempt. Sorry, fellow Yelpers, whomever mixed this drink will have to go back to Bar-tending school...  If you want to \"do\" Vegas on the Cheap, I guess this place is as good as any versus the super-duper-expensive Strip. But, you'd compromise first of all with the character of the establishment.... first impression... Old-School, Dank Red-Velvet Wallpaper, and Dark, mood lighting. And then when you're seated, you're handed a hefty, black, faux-leather bound Menu... that should have been re-bound years ago.   About twice as many people at the Bar than people having a sit-down meal.",

    "text": "We came into town hankering for a delicious cut of steak. When in Vegas you must live it up baller style. We called up to meet a couple friends who are locals and they suggested this place saying they had good food and interesting cocktails. After perusing the yelp reviews which are solid I decided we should listen to the locals and head off the strip. I really love checking out the local joints in Vegas, because there are so many places to choose from and a lot of times the strip places are amazing but quite pricey. We arrived a few minutes before our friends. I had used the handy dandy open table reservation through the yelp app! Upon arrival the words I said were 'don't judge a book...' The place seems like any other place you'd pass way out on the west side beyond the Rio. My boyfriend looked at me skeptically and then we walked in. Inside the intimate speakeasy type bar and dimly lit but very nicely furnished dining area we were seated in a big booth and handed massive menus. The server explained the cocktail menu was set up by time period each drink handmade by an awesome bartender with a fully stocked bar.  Each drink had a story of how it came to be and where it was popular as well as the ingredients. I was almost overwhelmed by the amount of choices until my friend ordered a drink called the bees knees and I copied! The server also informed us that happy hour was going until 8pm and that many items were 1/2 off including many of the steaks! Our 7pm arrival seemed to have been a miracle! My boy and I each ordered a 9oz filet with a side of dipping sauce, an extra but I love to dip, I had the au poivre sauce which was incredible peppery and perfect. We also split a wedge salad AND each steak came with a side! I chose the truffle Mac &cheese and boyfriend chose brussel sprouts with bacon lardon. We shared our sides of course, I shudder to say that I may really be becoming an adult because I preferred the brussels! Everything was perfectly cooked and to the exact temperature of our choosing. We had an after dinner shot of fernet to polish us off and when the bill arrived my jaw dropped! So much food & drink for such a low low price. We certainly were off the strip but you'd never know it by the food, presentation or service, only by the price. One more super cool thing is that you can order a 'surprise' drink from the bartender. They won't tell you the recipe but you can have them make you a special. My boyfriend asked for a special gin drink that came out quite tasty. All in all this is possibly my new favorite go to steak place off the strip. We will certainly be back for more tender juicy filet goodness in the near future.",

(yeah, I know...), but I got mine medium, and it was great.   I also tried the Pimm's cup. It was delicious. I would love to have one with Indian food. It seems like it would complement it well.  The atmosphere is nice. It kind of feels like you're in a classic movie. haha.",

It was like stepping back in time to an old time Chicago mob bar when we walked in and sat at the bar. Emily, the friendly bartender who served us, was very knowledgable and easy to get along with while making suggestions for other drinks as we enjoyed the drinks we had ordered. I had a pisco sour to remind me of time I spent in Peru and my wife had the Mary Pickford both of which were outstanding. We will certainly be back here again not only for drinks buy for dinner as well. 2 thumbs up here.",

It is a little pricey for the cocktails, I wish they would have a little more extensive happy hour list...However, their food menu items during happy hour is outstanding, totally worth a stop in. A group of 4 of us came for an early dinner, and everything was fantastic. All of the steak choices were amazing, perfectly cooked with tasty added sauces and the brussel sprouts were to dye for! We ended with the donuts...I could eat the entire plate to myself!  Overall, a cool hip little place with great food. Now if they would just include a few cocktails on happy hour (not just a glass of house wine or beer---Booo :(  we would be there a little more often",

Basically Abraham's bosom in the Old Testament is not heaven; it's a metaphor for one of their cocktails in your hand and their steak in your mouth. Anyone on yelp who is complaining about the \"doneness\" of their meat is a moron because they list out the exact temperature and color for doneness selection on their menu....AND double check with you when you order. So don't listen to the sissy reviews that are complaining they had no \"non meat\" options or \"weird colored\" doneness--these bozos can go to Fazolis. You should come here and have the best food of your life.",

    "text": "For me the atmosphere was better than the meal.  From the outside, it looks like your standard neighborhood bar, but on the inside, you'll think you stepped into a trendy new hotspot at the Wynn or the Bellagio.  Dim lighting, attractive servers, and groovy music all come together nicely.  I especially like the old movies playing on the flat-screens above the bar.  About the food:  Appetizer was great.  Entree was not so great.  I ordered these marinated meatballs as a starter that had wonderful flavor.  I should have made a meal out of them, but opted for the filet mignon with a mac & cheese side.  Be careful how you order it because medium well somehow got translated into well-done.  So my steak arrived as a flavorless, dried-out piece of beef jerky.  And the mac & cheese was a little too bland for my taste.  To be fair though, my buddy ordered the same steak medium RARE and his looked (and tasted) much better.  I also preferred his mushroom side to my mac & cheese.  Those were the best marinated shrooms I've ever eaten.  So altogether, I'd say the food can be hit or miss.  About the price.  I thought for a \"$$\" designation, I would be under $30 (Yardhouse pricing), but after an appetizer, entree with a side, and a decent tip (20%), I was into this meal for $75.  I wasn't on a date; I was just grabbing a late-night dinner with a friend. So this was a bit more than I wanted to pay.  Would I go here again? Sure, but maybe during happy hour when the menu is a little cheaper.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Vegas to celebrate our anniversary.  Since eating at restaurants on The Strip can be so pricey we decided to see if we could find a place off the Strip.  We asked a waiter at another restaurant if he could recommend a location and he suggested Herbs & Rye as a possibility.  He suggested another restaurant as well but that location was closed on Wednesday and Thursday nights so we booked a reservation for 6:30 PM at Herbs & Rye.  Parking - Parking is a real challenge at Herbs & Rye since they have a small parking lot.  We did find parking behind the restaurant in an ally where we saw several other cars parked.  We parked our car there and went into the restaurant.  We asked the hostess if the ally was a safe and good location to park and she said they have grown so much that people do park in the ally.  We had no issues with parking in the ally but it was a bit odd.  Drinks - We were seated almost immediately since we had reservations and we had arrived at the restaurant a few minutes before our time.  We were warmly greeted and water was brought to our table immediately.  I ordered one of their suggested drinks and the waitress made a suggestion for my wife's drink since she tends to be a bit selective.  She ordered the Walking by the Waldorf and I had The Diablo.  Both drinks were outstanding and my wife was pleased with the suggested beverage.  Dinner - We were shown the menu and most items are half priced during their Happy Hour which lasts until 8:00 PM.  My wife ordered 9 ounce Filet Mignon and I ordered the 12 ounce New York Strip Steak.  We both ordered the Garlic Mashed potatoes as our 1 selected option.  Both steaks were prepared perfectly and the Garlic Mashed potatoes were silky smooth.  Everything was seasoned to perfection and served hot.  Dessert - We ordered the Chocolate Chip cookie dessert that is served with ice cream.  The cookie or cookies are prepared when you order to make certain they are warm and served on a platter with ice cream.  This dessert was the perfect ending to our dinner.  Service - We had an outstanding waitress who made us feel so welcomed.  The entire staff at Herbs & Rye were warm and gracious to us the entire time we were at the restaurant.  I like to talk and was able to have delightful conversations with everyone who served us.  All in all, an outstanding experience that I highly recommend for anyone who is visiting Vegas.  Get off the Strip and eat at this wonderful location!",

The vibe in this place is very unique and one of a kind. It has the feel of a dark dive bar but the experience of fine dinning. The filet sliders are amazing and the tomato bisque is good. Especially, with the grilled cheese sandwich that it comes with. This place is great for couples and that happy hour is the perfect time to go because all of their steaks are set to half price during this period. Our server mark was very hospital and made great menu recommendations. He even heard that it was one of our friends birthday while we ate and brought out some homemade mini sugar donuts that were to die for. Check this place out if you ever get a chance when passing through Las Vegas.",

Honestly we've never had a bad meal here.  However you need to know that if you order during their amazing happy hour (50% off steaks, a few apps, & some wine) your auto gratuity will be based off what the original price of the food and drinks would have been. We were there over the weekend and tipped over $100 for a $300 check. It needs to be stated on the receipt that the tip is based on the \"original\" price. We always tip on the original price anyway.

Rather than perusing through Yelp, I opted for her to call the shots on where to take me. Now that's a rare occasion since more often than not, I do the cuisine-suggesting. The change was definitely nice and made for a few pleasant surprises.  She picked me up from MGM and took the backroads, clearly well off the strip to a local hang out called Herbs & Rye.   Upon entering, you definitely are taken aback by how dark it is in there. Seriously, your eyes don't quite fully adjust until you are seated. We got there in the early evening and it was starting to get packed. Fortunately, my girl made reservations and we were situated in one of their awesome booths facing the bar.   You don't have pages and pages of menu to peruse through. Their offerings are simple and to the point, no frills here. Don't get me wrong, just because the menu isn't laced with words you can't pronounce or ingredients you've never seen, doesn't mean quality has been sacrificed. On the contrary, the seem to use products of utmost quality with particular attention to the entree's final outcome.  We had  a wonderful server, I'd like to say his name was Richard though I'm no longer sure. He was warm without being overbearing, made us laugh a little and suggested deliciously buttery chardonnay for me.   BTW happy hour is awesome here, but many of their dishes, yes even the steaks at 50% off!  We ordered: Carpaccio - i have never had carpaccio before and this was just amazing. I would order this again in a heartbeat  New York Strip - We added bacon and oh my was that a thick cut piece of pork! They prepared it medium rare and seasoned just right  Truffle Mac n Cheese - Although not too truffle-y, this mac n cheese was still a hit  Sweet Potato Tots - We got this with the marshmallow crust. heaven in your mouth. geez.  Mind you they have a very impressive selection of cocktails as well.  We skipped dessert this particular time since we were going somewhere else for our sweet treats. Regardless, our meal was fantastic and kudos to the folks at Herbs & Rye for the stellar experience.",

I've been remiss, this review is a bit late but the old adage applies: better late than never. Herbs and Rye is, in a word, extraordinary. Okay, Las Vegas extraordinary if you will.  Imagine a dimly lit dining room, not large, but roomy enough to accommodate a good sized crowd. The usual bustle of a restaurant including the ambient sounds of servers taking orders, drinks being prepared and patrons boasting about the deliciousness of their meals or cocktails.  We started our evening at the bar and ordered a couple period cocktails. The Original Collins and the Martinez. Both were fantastic, but agreed we wouldn't name a favorite opting to continue trying them all. Each period cocktail has a unique taste, they really are special...each and every one mixed with expert care. It's loads of fun to sip and chat about that point in history. We opted to dine right at the bar, why not have access to master mixologist and owner Nectaly?  Ribeye for me, New York for him with his fav peppercorn sauce. Jalapeno creamed corn, mushrooms and truffle mac...all delish, I could have had a 2nd helping of the corn, it was that good.  Way too much food, but leftovers were just as tasty.  It gets quite busy here though I've never had a reservation as we tend to visit on the slower days. Take advantage the amazing happy hour prices!  Herbs and Rye is a must visit every time I'm in LV.",

The entire group stood in the cold entrance area for more than 55 minutes!' We decided this was ridiculous and left as 2 other couples decided the same thing. We were highly disappointed and it wasn't the fault of the meetup group organizer since she made prior reservations for the group. Not a good first impression to all of us that were coming to this restaurant for the first time.",

Creative, original drink menu and one of the best filet mignons I've ever eaten. Keep in mind they have a happy hour - 1/2 off steaks and certain other dishes. It can be pricey so I highly recommend you make a reservation during their happy hour times. Great service, delicious sides (although the garlic spinach was just okay) and I would definitely go back. It was nice to get off the strip during our trip to Sin City.",

We were a party of 5 and had reservations, but we didn't get a table till around 7pm. Service was nothing special than any other restaurant. The place was packed and still had a long line waiting to sit down. Food took a very long time, close to 45+ mins.  Couple of complaints, first being the parking lot: very limited and very hard to find a place during happy hour especially (5pm-8pm). I had to park at the gas station next door. The second thing that really bugged me was the automatic gratuity that's calculated at the full price of the meals. We had to pay a $50 tip on a $150 bill so the total came out to $200. That's about a 34% gratuity. A suggested tip is fine but I'm not a fan of mandatory gratuity payment especially if and when the service is bad.  The interior looks old school with dimmed lights and have a nice atmosphere, and again the food was amazing!",

    "text": "Come for the fantastic Happy Hour (5PM-8PM) Stay for the extensive list of specialty hand crafted cocktails!  I was put off at first because we had set up reservations on their website for a Friday night around 6PM for my birthday and when we arrived they said we did not have a reservation and that the wait would be about an hour and a half. I really had my heart set on this place so we decided to wait it out.  The Host was very accommodating and was able to get us seated fairly quickly!   All their steaks and meats are 50% off during happy hour so my $52.00 Filet Mignon was only $26.00 and some change and if i'm being honest even though the meat was beautifully prepared and absolutely mouth watering I would not be able to justify paying $52.00 for a tiny piece of meat like that. Just no. But I can kind of justify $26 considering it was a special occasion.  Now the drinks were really something special. I would say about 60% of their menu is dedicated to their specialty era cocktails. None of which were on happy hour unfortunately but they do have well liqueur on Happy Hour, but come on who is going to opt for a well mixed drink when they are presented with all these specialty options!!  I ended up asking our server for a recommendation and she recommended the Weekend at the Waldorf and it was beautiful, sweet and full of flavor, and strong.   Did I mention the drinks were strong?  I will definitely be back for Happy Hour!",

    "text": "Boyfriend made a date night reservation for two for Saturday at 5 PM. Seated right away, and it wasn't very busy when we arrived. When we left around 6:15, the bar was completely filled and the tables were starting to get full too.  We didn't order drinks, something I regretted later because the menu looked great, but the food was amazing! Service was great, and our waiter checked on us probably 10 times during the meal. The busboy who was waiting our table was also super quick, polite & attentive.  Mussels & clams: two separate appetizers each with a fresh soft baked roll. The clams were served in a white wine sauce that was not too sharp and not too sweet. The mussels were in a spicy red tomato-based sauce. Both were AMAZING and cooked to perfection. Definitely recommend for you seafood fans! Somehow we ended up finishing both between the two of us... it was that good.  Ribeye steak: medium rare - great without sauce, even better with steak sauce. We didn't end up ordering an extra sauce, but I would try the chimichurri next time.  Truffle mac n cheese: ohhhh my gosh if I could just eat one mac n cheese for the rest of my life, it would be this one. Subtle truffle flavor that leaves a wonderful aftertaste in your mouth, and the cheese is soft and mellow. The breadcrumbs on top add that extra layer of texture. So good!!  Garlic spinach: average spinach dish, nothing crazy exciting   Sweet potato tots: the sweet potato bits are chopped up inside, not mashed. Nonetheless, tasty! Fried perfectly, not too crunchy nor soft.  The only thing I would note as a slight negative is that I needed my eyes to adjust for almost a full 10-15 minutes before I could properly read the menu. It's veryyyyy dark inside. The ambience is nice though if you're there for the right type of occasion.   I'll be back!!",

    "text": "It's a Monday. It's 7:30pm. It's off-Strip, on West Sahara. And it's absolutely slammed. The parking lot and the back alley parking, all full. And so are all the tables inside. Pretty durn telling! Alas, once again, I'm going to have to take dinner at the bar.  The last time I dined this space was fifteen years ago, when it was still \"The Venetian.\" Yes there was once another Venetian. It was an old-school Italian-steakhouse joint and it had a lot of history. Many future chefs and restaurant owners started their Vegas ascent by serving time at The Venetian. And of course the famous and the infamous had dined it. Most of the classic MidCentury decor here now - engulfing curved black leather banquettes, red velvet wallpaper, bricked walls, et. al. - all inherited wholesale from The Venetian. And what a joint it was. My last order there was Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, and the bowl was just insanely massive. I spotted my tie - and three staff in formal attire rushed to my side with club soda as if I had had a heart attack. Ah, old Vegas. My next trip to Vegas, it was dark.  As the name portends, this venue is, first, a drop-dead-serious craft cocktail lounge. I know because I saw top-level buttons on the POS terminal for French 75, Corpse Reviver #2 and Boulevardier. I know because I saw 12\" of glass shelving holding about 50 bottles of bitters. I know because the featured cocktail menu is arranged chronologically. And I know because that menu didn't offer any pricing.  I also know because I watched the bartender prepare (and I was going to ask if they could) my ATF (on the rare occasion I do imbibe): a Ramos Gin Fizz. It's a classic cocktail from the 1920s that has gone almost entirely off-the-radar, even at the most crafty-ish of craft cocktail bars. In fact, I once asked for it at the Wynn (a five-star resort with a full-time mixologist on staff managing the cocktail menu seasonally) and what I heard was \"a-wha?\" After shuffling and calling about, they admitted they did not have one of the key ingredients on the property. And this drink is a ton of labor; the bartender said they had worked to whittle down the prep time to about 7 minutes, versus the original New Orleans recipe's 20-minute preparation (that including a 12-minute shake, that being why so many bars have nixed it). Yet I've never seen it made so well as I did here, with its egg-white-induced head slowly rising almost an inch above the lip of the glass, while it sat right in front of the attractive young woman who was informed enough to have ordered it.  If you want to learn & taste the history of classic cocktails, grab your plastic and saddle up here.  The crowd here, most interesting, mostly trendy, monied, sharply-attired, 25ish to 40ish. This bar is made for mingling-up movers, shakers and wanna-bes. Bring friends ... or, as I observed, readily make some new ones at the bar.  But I am at the bar to dine, to determine the True value of their steak deal: 5pm to 8pm, midnight to close, half-price. I say show up for the deal if you don't want to nuke your plastic. My 18oz (bone-out) rib-eye plus side, regular price, $60. And there were other cuts, much higher. Of course, even all the affluent that were in there, they were there for half-off, so there's no shame in claiming it for your own. I fronted a Caesar salad for $12.  My service at the bar was on-point and efficient, but not too fawning. Entirely understandable since these bartenders were often - literally - working a pair of Boston shakers at the same time.   The quality of the steak was nothing short of amazing. Since landing in Vegas, only my Golden Steer beef could venture to lay claim to besting this hunk of rib-eye. Perfectly charcoaled, perfectly juicy, wonderful marbling. Yet tender. Nirvana. And priced well, to boot. If I had skipped the salad, this quality/quantity of rib-eye, at thirty smackers, I would have almost been stealing it.   The background music never strayed once from its well-curated & upbeat intent: the very best of 1960s Carolina Shag, 1960s soul and 1960s Motown. And not at subtle decibel either. Its volume certainly evoked an up-tempo mindset at the bar, but it also surely inhibited convo in the banquettes. But the space was plenty noisy anyway, everyone reveling in their imbibing and dining experiences.  Yes, Herbs & Rye, you haven't seen the last of me, by any means. But I expect I am going to like you more somewhere after midnight, when I suspect things are a bit more sedated ... and the half-price-beef deal has kicked back in.   And when the lower volume and the black banquettes are all mine. And when I can watch your bartender's every nuance, as he crafts the pefect Ramos Gin Fizz ... just for me.",

The bar turns over pretty quick, and serves a full menu for dinner.   Happy hours means half off of steaks? What!??! Yup! Large portions and amazing quality of filets. Truffle Mac n cheese is to die for!   Don't know what you want to drink, their bartender or mixologists are wonderful at creating something for you.   Only negative would be super small parking lot.

Tonight seemed to be Motown night and they played everything from Earth Wind and Fire to the Jackson five.  The cocktails were excellent, their house Cab I loved and the Mac and cheese with truffles was amazing.  The only disappointment of the evening was 2 filets coming out over cooked. Our waitress Deborah immediately was there to make sure we were happy with how they were cooked and immediately recognized that they were over cooked. She immediately took them back to be remade.  While we were waiting the general manager appeared an apologized and comped us a round of drinks.  To say I was impressed is a understatement. The steaks appeared shortly cooked perfectly with new hot sides also. The steaks were amazing. I highly recommend Herbs and Rye and am happy to hear they are opening a new location called \"Cleaver\" right off the strip. We will be back soon!",

    "text": "Holy moly! I've been here a few times, but tonight was my first time for dinner. Let's start with pre-dinner drinks. This place really knows how to craft a cocktail. So far I haven't had a bad cocktail yet, but I'm mostly a vodka or wine girl. The happy hour red is not too shabby. I wish there were more choices, but considering the awesome HH food choices, I think we can agree to let that one go.   Our friends told us about the happy hour until 8pm and we were shocked that it includes half off steaks! What a great deal. We started with the mussels appetizer. I loved the sauce. Mussels tasted great, but that red sauce had a real nice kick to it. Quite a few of the mussels would not open, but the waiter had no issue bringing us another batch. For dinner, I ordered the Bone - in Kansas city. It was very flavorful and tender. I'm seriously laying in bed still thinking about it.  We also ordered the garlic smashed, garlic spinach, and sweet potato tots. Best way I've ever had sweet potato.  The spinach and smashed came out with a piece of garlic clove on top. Nice touch. I liked all of our sides, but the favorite at the table was the truffle Mac n cheese.   Ronnie was an excellent server. Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. If you have any questions on the menu, ask him! I'm not one for adding anything to an already amazing steak, but my friend really loved the chimichurri add on. My other friend cautioned that the ribeye was quite fatty, but the bf ordered it and was very happy. It was huge! They also ordered the homemade doughnuts and ice cream cookie. I can't comment on taste, because I was good and abstained, but it smelled delicious. Either would have easily been enough for the whole table!   I will def be back, I just don't know if I'll be able to try any of the other steak choices, as I'm still dreaming of the Kansas. Yum!",

Let me just start off and say...this place probably gets super packed. We went before happy hour so let's just say...my review is NOT for anything happy hour.   We drove around and found the restuarant...like others have stated...it's off strip...in an area that looks a little questionable. But hey...for food...I will usually try a place at least once. Anyway once you're inside...the interior is dark and has an old timey/victorian/prohibition-age like interior in my opinion. We were seated relatively quickly in the room to the left of the entrance. We ordered the following dishes:  Wings (Hot Buffalo) - Nothing special New York strip - good but nothing to rave about (probably would rave about it for HH prices) Flat iron steak - the bf's dish Peruvian chimmirchiri sauce - one of my favorite sauces of all time...but here again nothing super memorable Doughnuts - great! fresh and nicely sugared...yum just thinking about them  All in all the place is great...I think if I were to ever go again...I would try my luck and go for happy hour. I mean there are tons of great places to eat in Vegas for $$$.",

Happy hour was available to the entire restaurant (not just the bar area).  We happened to come at the right time for that too. Service was great! Food was excellent. Id love to come back here. I normally don't do rum drinks but the server made a drink suggestion for me and it turned at great! I normally am afraid to venture from my vodka or wine but after trying the weekend at Waldorf made me think that maybe I could do rum again in the future. The filet mignon I had was cooked to perfection. The truffled mac and cheese was amazing! The breadcrumbs on top were so crisp and tasted exactly how it should! The mashed potatoes had big chucks of garlic in it that was delicious! I 100% loved this place even down to the music they were playing. What a perfect way to celebrate our one year anniversary. And they gave us a complimentary dessert because they heard we were celebrating. Id totally recommend this place",

Some of the best ever. The Ribeye was just meh. Nothing special. The Pork chop was great.  The Brussel Sprouts had to be sent back. Undercooked and flavorless. Swapped them for the potatos mash. Not bad!  The MAC n Chess was just average.  Is it worth the $12 Uber ride from the strip? We probably would go back to try more of the Italian food.",

The happy hour deals of 50% off all steaks really makes it a phenomenal deal of the day.   Rib eye steak- 5 stars. Fatty and was cooked perfectly.  Kansas City bone-in - 4 stars. Not as fatty but good flavor. We asked for medium rare, but it was completely rare inside.   Brussel sprouts with honey and swine- 5 stars. Brussels Sprouts were as good as mon ami gabi, plus it has fat bacon or pork belly bits with a tint of lemon. I didn't taste the honey. It was good either way.  Truffle Mac and cheese- 4 stars.  Didn't taste the truffle oil at all, but it was a solid Mac and cheese.  Food was seasoned well. We went on a good day!!!!! Will be back again for happy hour when I have a hankering for steak.",

It looks like an old Italian place that's been converted into a custom cocktail bar / steakhouse.  The nondescript red door is its signature welcome.  Loved the cocktail menu!  The choices were organized by era - Prohibition, etc.  I opted for a basic Pina Colada and the Diablo.  Both very well done.  Our party order steaks and yardbird with risotto.  Added the potatoes, asparagus and jalapeno creamed corn.  Excellent all around.  The fresh donuts for dessert are a must-have.  Dang, they were addictive.",

    "text": "BIG PARTY BEWARE! BIG PARTY BEWARE! BIG PARTY BEWARE! So I would like to share my personal experience of this establishment. I came here with a party of 8 on a Thursday night at 6:30 for their HH. Since I am not a local, I made sure to make a reservation just in case it gets busy. Shortly after, I received a call for confirmation. The host was very nice, told us about HH and that there would be a 20% gratuity for large parties, which is pretty basic big party procedure. Everything was great, we arrive on time, got seated fairly fast.   Right when we got seated, a server and busser introduced themselves and told us about HH and 20% gratuity for big parties, which was fine. BUT OF COURSE, HE WOULD FAIL TO MENTION SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT and I betcha A LOT of YOU won't really noticed this... But after looking at 50% off steaks, you think you got yourself a nice deal right? WRONG! At least for big parties who get auto gratuity during HH.  I shall explain, here they told us that 20% grat would be added to our bill correct? So for example, you ate $200 worth of food but HH makes it $100, then adding 20% grat TOTAL should EQUAL $120. WHAT THEY FAILED TO MENTION WAS THAT GRAT WAS BASED ON FULL PRICED MENU PRICE. So what does that mean? WELL...INSTEAD of 20 off $100, its 20 off $200, which EQUAL to $40. INSTEAD of $120, you would be charged $100 + $40 (the actual grat) = $140. So you're basically paying 40% tip. INSANE!!!   It screams SCAM SCAM SCAM! You think we are suckers!!! This is such BAD ETHIC for your restaurant. Not only did they fail to mention to us at the beginning of seating. They also failed to mention it to me when I asked for about their policy during the confirmation called. Quite frankly I feel CHEATED like they think we're idiots. Plus, the restaurant was dim so it was very hard to read anything...I did not find out about this until we were going over the finance of our visit.   If I knew of this policy, I would have split up the party into 4 and 4 and avoided this excessive charged, but how was I to know when all your staffs just told me it would be 20% gratuity, which normally the amount I tip anyways.  SO PLEASE, check your bills guys seriously because they will not readjust the bill for you unless you are there. Unfortunately, we found out about this when we got back home ( in Cali). And yes, already talked to their management, not much they can do. But for all you yelpers out there hopefully, my post will help you reconsider.",

My friends and I have been here lots of times because it's one of our favorite restaurants. Also, it is a great place to bring your family because they have lots of seating and kid friendly. They also have a private area if you want to throw a party. Great place to go on dates because the lighting is dim and great music! So far everyone that I have recommended this place to has never been disappointed. The service is excellent, they will never leave your glass empty.   Happy hour is from 5PM- to 8PM and 12AM to 3AM(for you late night eaters), which is half off food menu which are the items with a star next to it!   Must try Items: Chicken Wings, Ribeye, Flatbread, Calamari, pretty much everything on the menu because yes it is that delicious!",

Having a hangry group of 11, we started to get a bit fussy.  They sent shots on the house outside where we were waiting as well as some bread baskets which made us much happier and made the trips inside one by one to complain go away.  Once seated, we had a wonderful waitress [really wish I got her name!].  I don't believe we're the easiest group to deal with honestly and she kept a smile on her face the entire time!  Appetizers we got some shrimp cocktail which was delicious, also an order of wings that came out cold but we were so hungry we didn't seem to care.  Everyone at the table got steak and had good things to say about it other than a few complaints about the way their meats were cooked.  I personally am not much of a steak person but I tried my fiance's and it was delicious!  I got the chicken breast on angel hair pasta and it was fantastic!  Their extensive cocktail list was pretty awesome too!  I tried a few from the table and they were all yummy.  I'll definitely be back.",

Old school handcrafted cocktails with proper spirits and natural ingredients will lighten your mood and the food will nourish your soul. During happy hour all steaks are half price (which makes them reasonable). The 24oz porter house will melt in your mouth ($30 during happy hour). I also highly recommend adding the bacon and blue cheese crust for another $6.50. How do you make meat better? Duh, add more meat! This isn't just bacon, it's 2 quarter inch thick slabs of amazing covered in melted blue cheese! For dessert how about a skillet of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies covered in ice cream? Yeah, I thought so. 4 cocktails, 2 entrees, a side and dessert came to $90. That's a bargain for how good everything was. Highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Returned last night and sat at the bar during happy hour. The happy hour is top-notch as virtually everything on the menu, including some hefty entrees, is 50% off from 5pm-7pm, and then they have reverse happy hour, but darn it, I didn't notice the hours. I was being selfish. Sorry! Oh, wait, there it is right up there on the Yelp business listing: Late night 50% off 11pm-3am. This adds up quickly in a good way. My bar mate and I had five cocktails and some crispy calamari for $25. I am not even sure how that is possible, but it happened.   I had a couple of Diablos- a tequila drink with ginger ale, cassis and lime. My friend had a Clover Club followed by two French 75s. She really liked the French 75; it is made with champagne. All of their syrups are made in house, and you can tell that they take pride in their craft.   The vibe is VERY dark and mysterious. I am still not digging their plates, but I guess that is a minor detail I will have to get over. It is balanced out by the wallpaper. Just don't look down at your plate if you can help it.  The bartender and staff are nice characters; they can be mysterious. I think they really take their prohibition theme seriously, which I can appreciate. I didn't have a dining room experience, but I enjoyed relaxing at the bar without being smothered by smoke! I am adding a star for a smokefree evening. If you sit at the end closest to the door, you get the ins on the restaurant action, as that is where all of the servers come to retrieve their drinks. I appreciate a little behind the scenes commentary.   Oh, and they are hosting special cocktail events on Tuesdays at 10pm. We had been there since 6:30, so we didn't stick around, but it looked like it was going to be a fun shindig. I received a rather handy Sailor Jerry dog tag necklace with a built-in bottle opener. I might check the event out next week.   So, keep up the good behavior boys! I am giving you five stars, and that is a very big responsibility.",

    "text": "I attended a fabulous Yelp elite event at H&R last night, but I'll base my review on a dining experience last week. The stand out feature of Herbs and Rye is really the atmosphere. The velvet wallpaper, copper walls, the cheesey electronic piano guy. I love it ! It was relatively empty on a Saturday night and quiet enough to carry on a conversation - my kind of place !   I tend towards the more girly on my drinks so I can't say the drink list was particularly appealing to me. That being said, if you're a rye drinker (as the name implies!), you'll love the drinks here. My Hemmingway daquari was decent, but not a drink I'd drive across town to drink again.   As many have mentioned - the Happy Hour is insane. I love the fact that it goes till 8 PM (note, the Yelp hours are currently wrong at the time I'm writing this review). Tons of great food options on the HH menu:  *Chicken cordon bleu ($8) - chicken itself was deilghtful but the risotto it was served with was the worst risotto I've ever had ! It had a scoop shape like it had come out of a mold and it was really dry. Honestly good risotto shouldn't hold a mold shape, it should pool in a puddle of goodness on your plate. Minor detail. *Ribeye ($15) - served with choice of 2 sides. Ribeye itself was very tasty. No, for $15 you're not getting the type of steak served at Cut, but it blows every other \"discount\" steak I've had in this town out of the water. Again the sides here weren't all that special. Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Wouldn't pick either of those again despite those being my normal favorites.  *On a sidenote I did try the flatbreads at the Yelp elite party and those were fabulous - even cold . I'll have to try one of those next time.  Served with dinner was delightful bread with the coolest butter I've ever encountered. It was honey butter with chives and parsely . Sounds gross, but the flavor worked for me. It was so intriguing !   Overall a great experience was awesome service. Fun atmosphere, great for a date or a group of friends. If they could get their sides up to snuff this is a 5 star place for sure.",

Both of us heard good things about Herbs and Rye so I called an hour before and they had room, excellent.  Arrived and exterior looks like a classy bar. Walked in and was seated promptly. Looking at the menu, they didn't have the Mushroom Panzerotti that that was on the website menu. No problem, ordered the Linguine & Clams. The clams were really good as they were still in the shell so really fresh. I really liked the flavor of the clam juice with the wine, garlic and chili. Only thing that was disappointing was the pasta was overcooked. I like my pasta soft but it was like baby food. Didn't order dessert as we were on our way to a show.   I would come back for drinks but not for dinner.",

You walk in and it has good music and a dark setting. Super chill dive bar vibe with 5 star food! The menu doesn't match the spot at all! The drinks are specially mixed and themed during the prohibition era! Super good and super clever setting. I highly recommend his spot!!!",

So thumbs up for that part!   I decided to order the filet mignon (half off cuz of the 12-3am happy hour) and truffle Mac and cheese. The filet mignon was nice and juicy and I absolutely love that it was half off! The truffle mac and cheese was yummy as well. im a huge mac n cheese fan and this did not disappoint me! 'The only complaint I have is the service, took about 10 min to finally get someone at our table. She was just really boring and made me feel like I had to rush to eat lol.  Didn't really check on us to see how we were doing either.  This is probably why I had to give this place 3 stars! Sorry guys. But food was great!",

One of the most important things for me is consistency and they have showed us that time and time again.  Amazing steaks, cocktails and apps.  Happy hour is a must and luckily we live 2 miles away.  Calamari is crunchy but not chewy. Meatballs are flavorful and always order extra bread to clean the plate.  Steaks are the best in town. And a must are the donuts!!! Just try them and you will understand. Great classic place.",

High quality perfectly cooked stakes and delicious sides. The fact that it's within walking distance of my house is also a bonus, haha. The Farmer flat bread sounds weird, but it's soo good. My favorite part about this place is the atmospheres... Vintage chique and a \"locals\" place by far, a great place to avoid the tourists! Looks creepy and dumpy from the outside but that's just to dissuade the wrong crowds. Hmm maybe I should delete this comment so it stays that way?",

Landing at 1am it just so happened to be Happy Hour :D  This place bring back a lot of good o' memories as we use to come here when it was Venetian, an old Italian joint way before Sauteed Clams was established.  It was our alternative to steak and eggs graveyard special for cheap eats back in HS.  I still remember the inconsistent creamy fettuccine alfredo they served with house salad, a soda of your choice, and unlimited bread and butter for $3.99.  It was what I think was our best kept secret as everyone else was still into that S&E phase.  Fast forward 10 years later, I'm not being stingy this time.  Oh no, I'm telling everyone and their mama about this place!  This has to be one of the best HH place I've been to in a long, long time.  Way better than Brio's HH, but sadly that's a whole another review that's not even worth mentioning.    The difference between Herb and Rye is that they stay True to their menu and offer most items at discount, 50% off to be exact, than creating a bogus menu.  Unless you dig that sort of thing then that's cool, but if you're like me then you'd want a real entree as meal.  Let me get a *dab*. Anyone?  We went with our bartender's few suggestions, Flat Iron steak with red pepper mash potatoes and gnocchi bolognese.  He let it be known that the chef recommend that we do not go above medium temp on the steak.  They didn't know it, but right then and there we \"click.\"  Our meal was came out perfect.  Wasn't too much food, but just right.  Sooo darn good that i came back the next night after a long day trip to Cali with my sister to try something else that our bartender suggested since i really enjoyed the two dishes we shared the night before.  Unfortunately they were closed at 2am since they had a mixology tasting party earlier, but luckily I met, and excuse my spelling, Nickolay, the owner.  We chatted for a bit in the parking lot.  Found out we both once worked for the same guy before.  For 2 entree just barely under $25 this place is defiantly an option for a late night snack.  Bravo Herb and Rye, way to carry on Venetian's saga.",

When I did get greeted by the server, all he said was \"one?\" Service was very mediocre. I wouldn't normally care about these things, but for the price of the food, you expect better service.

The wait staff are phenomenal, and I love the dark speakeasy vibe (red velvet wallpaper, black booths, and swanky chandeliers).  I've rarely seen it crowded, which actually kind of worries me because I wonder how it stays in business!  They have some steakhouse style food, but what I go for are the fantastic creative (old school style) drinks and service.  The \"classic cocktails\" are amazing, and the service is personal and helpful.  There are a few drinks that dabble with absinthe, so if you're a fan of the licoricey liquor, here's a place to try it.  My favorite drink is the Aviator - which from my memory is a combo of gin, lime, and a violet infused liquor - oh my!  They also serve classics like \"Moscow Mule\" and will likely make anything you request.  The happy hour deal is fantastic, with some of the steaks (half price).  My friend labelled it as one of the best steaks he's ever had.  I have tried a few of the flatbread pizzas, which are a fair deal at $10 a piece.  We tried the linguine and clams, which was good but not the best I've ever had.  For a cool off-strip vibe with great cocktails and an atmosphere where you can chat with your friends (i.e. not blasting boom-boom music), or sit at the bar on your own, check this place out!",

Unfortunately, it's not very close to my hood, so it took a couple months for me to make it over, but here is the lowdown:  Pros *Cool cocktail menu with lots of classic drinks. *Fair prices during regular hours. *Awesome prices during happy hour. *Free drink for yelpers every time you visit. *Cool ambiance inside. *Friendly bartenders who genuinely wanted to make us drinks we loved.  Cons *Location. It's really not near anything else, so it's definitely inconvenient to go out there if you aren't either a resident of the West Sahara area or staying at the Palace Station. *Crowd. As in, there was none. Why was it completely dead on a Friday night???  Overall I'll be back to H&R to enjoy their cocktails and happy hour (maybe even to try the food?), but it's just too far to become a regular.",

I really enjoyed their selection of classic cocktails, everything from pre-prohibition, during Prohibition, to modern classics. We also had several food items including the steak tartare the mac and cheese and really enjoyed all of them.  Next time I'm getting the steak. They have a half office in steak before eight pm.",

We let the bartenders make us some of their signature cocktails, which were great!  Our server Charlie was amazing!   Disappointing the food was not, it lack flavor and seasoning. I ordered a wedge salad which was big enough to share, I got the surf & turf, my sweetheart got the ribeye. It was the first time in all our years I haven't seen him finish a steak and the leftovers are still sitting in the fridge 3 days later. The corn side just tasted like a jalapeno was dropped in it, and the Mac & cheese was ok. Must have been an off night for the chef.... I have been waiting so long to try this place from all that I have heard about it, unfortunately for me and my sweetheart the food did not live up to the hype and we did pay full price.  We arrived at 7:40 and the hostess advised us we would have to wait until our reservation time to be seated, again we understood as it was a Friday night, the bar was slammed packed, took us 15 minutes just to get a drink, we did notice how right after happy hour the place cleared out pretty quick. I wouldn't pay full price for that meal again, I have no problem paying full price when it's good food!",

I was here for my 24th birthday with a group of 11 I had another guest who last minute didn't show up but in these cases Herbs N Rye is one of those places that will seat you once most of your party is there. At that point in time we had 7 and they let us sit down as the rest of the guests arrived moments later. I was so relieved that they could seat us as many will simply say \"No we cannot seat incomplete parties\" so Herbs N Rye thank you for that. Next was the drinks and food, as always it was amazing! Although I do have to point out our server (don't remember his name) took a little longer to get our drinks and one of my friends ordered two at the same time which were brought out after we asked a second time about them. It was busy for a Thursday so we could understand how maybe they were short staffed or they had to serve many more tables. After the meal is done comes the check which I mentioned to everyone to bring cash in my party but as always there are some who didn't do they were kind enough to split the check. I understand it's a headache and that's why they have this policy so I didn't mind but they made it very accommodating.   One more thing anyone who goes needs to try their donuts, OMG even when you are full order them try them warm and fresh and take the rest home!!!!",

The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars was for the very dark lighting in the restaurant (we could barely see our menus) and the lack of parking. After eating here I can understand why there is hardly any empty parking spaces! LOL! We definitely plan on going back!",

Line of people to be seated in the dinning rooms and booths in the bar were full but found a couple seats at the bar.  The mixologist, made very tasty drinks. I had I believe it's called a lions tail which was really great, not too sweet, not to bitter and almost no alcohol after taste.  I told the bartender to surprise me with the drink, telling him a little of what I like and it was perfect.  My friend had pineapple juice and tequila which she said was great too.  Once you walk in it's as if you stepped into a prohibition era speakeasy, it's super dark and it's on the loud side with all the peoples conversations.   Everyone that was there was having a great time. Great little spot to have a great cocktail and the food is really great too, even though it's been a few years since I ate there.  Nice little spot to cozy up to a bar and have a crafted cocktail.",

We started with the spicy mussels as an appetizer. So unbelievably good that I wanted to drink all of the delicious sauce after the mussels were gone. Then we shared a large perfectly cooked rib eye with sides of asparagus and their delicious mac and cheese with truffles. Their menu of specialty cocktails is extensive and we tried the  Vesper and Scofflaw - both were excellent. I suggest making reservations for dinner on the weekend - it's very popular and packed to the hilt and standing room only at the bar.",

    "text": "How have I not written a review for Herbs & Rye sooner?!  I've been here roughly around 35 times in the last few years. Great quality steaks, fun and romantic atmosphere (depending on what you're going for), and an extensive cocktail menu.  Also a huge local spot so it's very likely you'll run into someone, especially if you work in the industry.  Oh, and 50% off the steaks during Happy Hour (5-8 pm and midnight- closing) what's not to love?!  I've tried the majority of their menu and my favorites are:   Filet mignon (all the steaks are delicious. Pick whichever cut you prefer, high quality meat you'd find on the strip without ridiculous prices)   *the chimmichuri sauce is soooo good! I also like the house rub but beware- it's very spicy.  Sweet potato tots- You just have to try these. So so good.   Truffle Mac & Cheese- Yes. Just yes.   Jalapeno creamed corn- I tend to get this less often, but sooo yummy.   Truffle fries- Simple truffle fries, but they always hit the spot.  All the sides are a generous portion, and each steak comes with one included in the price. Also, the flatbreads are all great. My favorites are the Bistecca and Bruschetta.   For drinks, I recommend the Moscow Mule and Weekend at the Waldorf!  All in all, I love this place (that's why I keep coming back). The only thing I would improve is the service can be spotty, sometimes amazing service and sometimes it's very so-so.",

Started with the beef tartare, a little light in portion size but was still good, very tasty umami beefy goodness. Wife got the Caesar salad, pretty standard. Cousin got the wedge salad, this looked amazing, and came with super thick cut, awesomely awesome bacon pieces. Definitely have to get this if you go.  I had the ribeye, ordered medium rare, and I was very pleased to see it was cooked perfectly. The beef was well marbled and no gristle. It had the taste of an aged steak but I can't say it was a Vegas top ten, then again there are some serious steak places here. Wife had the filet, also cooked expertly, these people know how to cook some meat.  Drinks were once again awesome, and the whiskey selection is very respectable.  Only complaint was the service, the guys were super nice and chill but it took quite a while to get orders and drinks, and although water refills came quickly I can't say anything else did. Course I was borderline hangry so my perception could have been altered just a bit.  Overall I recommend going and trying it out. Check out the old review for the cocktail review.",

Server was great about suggesting and recommending drinks to help us, as the menu is a bit overwhelming- the Blackthorne, Pegu, and Diablo were all tasty and strong without being too sweet. I do wish they offered better wines, and found it odd they don't have any beers on tap.  The littleneck clams app has a delicious lemon-herb sauce, but the half-price flat iron was the star: cooked to perfection, juicy, and well-seasoned. I'll have to come back hungrier to try a better cut. Sides of sprouts and truffle mac were both enjoyable, if a touch salty. Wish the HH menu featured more apps, like the flatbreads.  In addition to dinner and drinks, they make killer desserts. Our party couldn't decide, so we got both their seasonal apple bread pudding and their fresh-baked cookies. Both were massive and really hit the spot for the sweet tooth folks.   I'll be back for more drinks and eventually the rib eye. Maybe next time I'll actually sit in the bar area, but the volume of the music was blasting even sitting in the quieter dining room area. Great retro-Vegas, blast from the past experience.",

We were seated quickly and handed a menu.  I knew before we arrived that happy hour is half off steaks from 5pm-8pm & 12am-3am.     We ordered the spicy mussels, which was also a happy hour price.  Delicious.  The bread served along with it was super fresh, warm and toasty.   Mark, our server was very nice and knowledgable about the menu. They specialize in classic old school cocktails.

Stay away from it.  If nothing else, I praise them for the drinks they offer and the bartenders who were extra special.!   Sincerely,   The Guy with the crown",

Out bartender Giseppie, a former New Yorker, was great. Suggested us cocktails and made us unique drinks based on our likes and recommendations. The food was delicious. Caprese, mussels, ribeye, NY strip, and warm cookie desert, were all good. Fantastic first experience. Was still pricey, even with half off steaks, but 100% worth it.",

    "text": "Came Saturday night with my girl. One thing about this place is the servers are so amazing here and the bartenders are the best in Vegas. Ordered my usual Mussels in a Spicy marina sauce with extra bread to dip, I can eat this 3 times a week. Also got the beef carpaccio which was excellent. Had the Calamari and this dish honestly has to go off the menu, forgotten forever. It was flavorless fried calamari topped with a pound of peppers and it was totally soggy, it's should be crispy every bite. Im from NY and i know good fried calamari. Change the breading on the Calamari and serve it with a spicy marinara and lemon and bam  This is an updated review. Came here last night with a party of 6 and I was soooooooo disappointed with the meal. This is the first time I've ever ordered food other than some appetizers. The spicy mussels they brought out were ice cold, still love the sauce though. My GF ordered a Filet Mignon and we always eat Med-Rare and it was clearly medium and tough. I on the other hand ordered the Rib Eye and it honestly could've been the worst steak I've ever had. It was overcooked and there was tons of cartilage in it where it took me 15 seconds to chew a single bite. The jalapeno creamed corn was good and the truffle mac was good. The moscow mule was overflowing with ice that ice was falling off as they handed us our drinks so basically 5 sips and we were done. Not exactly a good night at this place. If they plan on opening a steak house called clever they better get better quality meat than they served la   I love this place. Me and my gf go here all the time. The spicy muscles is amazing, i dip a whole loaf of bread in the sauce. I also love their drinks, I usually order the Moscow Mule and its always perfect. I like the darkness in their and the music is great. I heard they're opening a steak house soon, can't wait to try it out",

    "text": "Was here last night with a large group for a birthday party. It was my second time here and at first I was excited to be back based on my experience the first time around. I was shocked to find customer service and quality control so horrendous this second time around! Long story short, this place has totally gone downhill and I likely won't be back. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time coming here either unless you want your food to come out an hour late and then take a half hour at the end to pay your group's tab!  Rachel and I got here about 40 min before our party's reservation so we decided to sit at the bar for some drinks and salad as an appetizer. After being greeted by the bartender we didn't see him again for another 15 min and sat around waiting for our order to be taken. What bartender doesn't ask for a drink order right away?  After everyone placed their orders we proceeded to wait about 45-50 min before any of food even came out. I was wondering if it was even going to come out at all! When our food arrived they brought everyone's except Roger's with no explanation of any kind...it was almost like the forgot that he had ordered anything. When this was brought to the server's attention she checked on it and came back to inform us that they had just \"fired it up\" and that it would \"be out shortly\" with no further explanation of what happened to the original order, nor an apology. About 10-15 min passes before the server returns to inform us that Roger's steak would be out soon and that they had overcooked the original one. Funny how they would wait to tell us this instead of being up front about it...I call bs!  When Roger's steak finally came it was overcooked and not cooked medium rare like ordered. How hard is it for a steak restaurant to not overcook 2 steaks in a row?! After this debacle they still wanted to charge us for his steak at first and then decided not to in the end...I'm sure they heard that we were all Yelpers lol! But seriously this place is ridiculous. No updates on your food and no service whatsoever. It's almost like they don't care if their customers are happy or not, and we definitely were not.  At the end of the night we attempted to settle our table's tab. We had asked the server at the beginning of the meal to split our tabs, however, at the end of the meal she told us that this wasn't possible. WTF! Why didn't you just tell us that in the first place? The manager came out to explain that it was against store policy to split checks of groups with 6 or more people...Ok, so it's possible...you're just not going to do it? Who says that? Especially after the crap service we just endured?   It was a debacle trying to figure out the tab due to this and they had to run about a dozen cards separately. I almost wanted our group just to leave because the servers didn't know what was going on, except that they couldn't split the tab. If it wasn't for the manager coming out to handle the situation I'm pretty sure it would've taken longer than 30 min to figure this out and I would've just left. I don't have the patience or time to deal with crap like this. Get your shit together or don't run business! We were also pissed to see a 20% auto gratuity which is bs because they deserve nothing  Save your time and your money and avoid this place. There are so many other steak places here in Vegas and there's really nothing special about this one. Steaks after overpriced just so they can do a \"happy hour\" 50% deal and even then the appetizers are $15, sides are $7 and sauces are $3.50 for such a crap place that's not even fancy at all.",

    "text": "Herbs & Rye was some of the best dining I've had in awhile. The aesthetic was incredibly cool, with a jazzy vintage theme, the service was awesome, the food was delicious, and the drinks - which are the main event at Herbs & Rye - definitely lived up to the hype.   The parking lot is small but there are plenty of empty spaces in the businesses to the west, and just looking at the exterior, you would have no idea how classy (but not fussy - some people were dressed to the nines in the bar area but plenty were wearing jeans and flip flops) the place is on the inside.   Happy Hour is from 5 (I think?) until 8, and most foods and basic mixer drinks are half off. That was an incredible deal and certainly one that will have me coming back to the restaurant. Their specialty drinks - which consume 3 whole pages in the menu, compared to the 2 pages of food choices - are really what H&R is known for, and for a good reason: they're unique in their flavor and strong in a way that drinks no longer are in Vegas these days. Arranged according to the historic era in which they were popularized, it is difficult to choose which one to order, as they are all so interesting. While they aren't included in the Happy Hour, they really hit the mark: for $11, I found myself pretty drunk after half a glass of my cocktail (admittedly, I am a bit of a lightweight, but still - it's a great value).   For drinks, I chose the Weekend at the Waldorf - a very sweet and fruity concoction that our waitress described as \"like drinking a pez candy\" - and I have to agree with her. I loved it. My friend got the Fogcutter, which was served icy cold in a fun ceramic tiki mug, and while it was a blend of liquors I'm not really into, she loved hers, too. For food, she got (and loved) the flatbread, which, as an app, wasn't included in the Happy Hour pricing. For $4 more, I got the NY strip steak with garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was very well seasoned and the mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful.   This will probably be my new go-to date night venue. I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "So we had a reservation for 11 on September 1st 2018.  The restaurant atmosphere was great and it seemed like the service was also going to be great.  We received a warm welcome and our table was ready for us.  Here is where the great service ended. We placed our drink orders and it took about 20min to get some of our drinks, mostly water.  I ordered a beer and it took about 40min.  Two other people ordered coffee, one coffee came out in about 15min and the second coffee was out in about 40min after we reminded the server about the coffee. Next, we ordered our meals.  My wife ordered the filet mignon well done.  The steak came out red and bloody with blood all over the plate.  She had to return it and have it cooked some more.  I ordered the New York steak medium rare and mine was almost well done.  My buddy also ordered the New York steak Medium Rare and that was also mostly well done.  It was late and we were hungry and did not feel like returning our steaks, it had taken almost an hour before we got our orders so we decided to eat them.  It was a well-cooked steak, nothing to brag about. Half way through my meal I was ready for my second beer.  Placed my order and about 30min later I had to flag down the waiter and asked \"why is it taking so long to get a beer?'  His response was, \"we have a new person taking orders\" not sure why that would take over 30min to get a beer.  Since we had a party of 11 people, the tip was automatically added to the bill.  We just wanted to finish eating and leave, so we made no fuss about the tip.   For an $800 bill for 9 people the service was awful and the food was mediocre.  I'm sure you can find a much better steak house for this kind of money.  We had a party of 11 but two where children under eight so they did not order.  If it was up to me, I would not have left a tip.  I will definitely not be coming back to this place again.",

Go in and be transported back in time to a classic old Italian steakhouse with great service, really great music, and fantastic food from start to finish. Oh and the coolest and most extensive cocktail list I've ever seen. The bartenders really care about mixing you a great cocktail as much as the chef cares about a perfectly cooked steak.

    "text": "I've been here twice only. I really had nothing to say the first time around (just my friend and I) except that it took forever and a day to get our check.  The majority of the review here will be for the second experience (tonight). It was a fairly large group -- a group of 12 for a birthday dinner.  When making the reservation for the large party, they tell you you need to order appetizers to start off. However, they didn't enforce this when we were there, FYI.  Most of us ordered steaks because of happy hour half off. I personally got the flat iron (medium rare and $14 due to HH) with a side of asparagus (comes with a side).  I enjoyed my food. No complaints at all there. However, as a party, service wasn't as expected. We asked for splits check when we were ordering -- she said okay. Well, that was easy, for such a large group.  When the food finally came out (mind you, it was really long since there were so many of us), one of us didn't get his steak. Apparently they made a mistake and made it well done instead of medium rare (though, when it did finally come out, it was medium). That issue was resolved in the end as he got his steak comped.  She forgot about splitting checks only to come back 10 minutes later to tell us we can't do split checks and we just simply have to tell her how much to charge on each credit card. Bah. That was a good pain in the butt because somehow we were short $10 and it was just such a huge headache. They did give us a small treat at the end (not sure what kind of donuts they were? beignets?) for the birthday boy.  Manager was nice and easy to work with but I guess just the system of doing things was not a pleasant experience. The food was a much better experience for me this time around. So, try their steaks! Maybe not at full price, but happy hour -- why not?",

    "text": "Herbs and Rye owner Nectaly Mendoza has made every effort to authenticate the cocktail experience. Inspired by the \"speakeasy prohibition\" era and the history of the cocktail in general, along with old school Vegas mob culture, Herbs and Rye incites that mystery mob feel with it's After Hours popularity, and (I'll quote my cousin Jillian P.) \"red felt wallpaper, fake leather booths, tiny chandeliers\"... But just like Peppermill invokes the sentiment of  Las Vegas, Herbs and Rye does too- just not in the way we're all used to.  And even if there was a hint of Prohibition Pretension, it would be entirely valid. Gerardo De La Torre, Bar Manager and head Mixologist delivers exceptional cocktails, all True to the original recipes.  A 'bartender' is given the title of Mixologist when he/she has mastered the Classics of the past and is able to create new cocktails while deriving inspiration from these classics and pairing them with modern ingredients. That Mixologist will then take the title of Bartender rather than Mixologist when these abilities have been demonstrated. It's a serious profession, and coming from New York City, I realize that this isn't widely recognized or understood throughout Las Vegas.  My favorite cocktail of the evening was the Brandy Crusta; Maraschino Liqueur, Orange Curacao, Lemon,  and Bitters. But that's because I told Gerardo what I was in the mood for. ... Chances are, if you're not happy with the cocktail it's because you weren't accurately articulating your likes/dislikes, either that, or you don't know what you like yet! Which isn't a bad thing at all, because these are just the guys to help you figure that out. For example, I'm not a big fan of Manhattans, and I didn't explain this part, but I do like whiskey and brandy so I ordered \"Remember the Maine\"; Rye, vermouth, Cherry Brandy, Absinthe. This cocktail resembles a Manhattan in style- so it wasn't really my taste, but entirely precise in execution.  My favorite food item is The Calamari, and Im not usually a fan of calamari. It's unique, and not your typical dive bar version, I'm talking peppercini, pancetta, with a zesty lemon aoli drizzle. I really loved this !  An excellent addition to the menu if you are in the mood for dessert is their Hungarian Tokaji Wine 2005 vintage. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. A melt in your mouth not too sweet Old World delicacy.  Service was attentive and outstanding. Thank you Eddie!  Herbs and Rye has emerged as a rare and authentic cocktail experience; an exceptional and exciting addition to the Las Vegas cocktail scene.",

    "text": "Kind of an odd experience here and I don't know what to make of it.  I'm trying to find a decent, old-school cocktail place in this town.  We had heard good things about this place so decided to check it out.  Some friends of ours wanted to go out, too, so we met them there on a Thursday night around 7 or 8pm.  Our friends got there before us and when we walked in and saw them, they looked really freaked out.  They were the only people in the dining room sitting at a table with an old man in the corner playing the keyboards.  Kinda reminded me of Swingers (the movie), except the fact that the place was empty.   No one in the dining room and a few people at the bar.  When we sat down, our friends kept whispering how weird the place was.  We ordered some drinks and our friends had already got some food, which was ok but nothing special.  The drinks were also ok but nothing special.  Maybe I've been spoiled by my trips to NY and SF and need to just accept the fact that LV will not reach that level.  I ordered a mint julep but it didn't come in the special metal cup, which made me sad.  Accurate glassware is important to me.  My husband thought the Moscow Mule was ok, but not enough to come back.  The keyboard guy then decided to come over and talk to us.  He was pretty much incomprehensible.  I'm not entirely sure what he wanted.  The place is fairly inexpensive but it kind of creeps me out.  I can't really expect much out of a late night (24-hour?) bar in this town.  Oh well, the search for an excellent cocktail in Vegas continues.",

    "text": "I just returned from this restaurant & thought I'd write a review while the experience is still fresh. Upon entering I liked the look of the place, it was very small and quaint and had that dark vintage feel about it. They had a dinning area that seemed really dead and dark and kinda secluded. We sat in the booths by the bar. I had a pisco sour and it was okay.  As for the food we started w/ beef carpaccio and it was good. For my main I got the filet mignon and garlicy spinach as a side. My guy got the Surf & Turf (Filet mignon & lobster) which came w/ garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus (he changed it for one of their other sides and they upcharge $4 for the change). My steak was good but my spinach was uneatable..no exaggeration, they were THE SALTIEST thing I've eaten my entire life..I think they might have accidently dumped salt in them. I told our waitress and got brussel sprouts instead, they were too charred and dripping w grease. His food was fine, steak was good and lobster was so so, potatoes were good. I must admit the broccoli he substituted was DELICIOUS!! I would recommend the broccoli here but that's really about it.  All in all: Service - our waitress was polite and nice, she was great!  Food - pretty terrible, they messed up very simple stuff  Price - in comparison to the atmosphere and the food, definitely not worth it! You can get a better meal at another steak house that has a much better ambience and much livelier. Honestly though, im a foodie and if the food is great I'll go anywhere and this just wasn't.   Atmosphere - small, not very lively. Nothing interesting.",

    "text": "This is without a doubt THE best cocktail bar in Las Vegas. Hands down. There is not one cocktail they serve that is not delicious. And they can make you anything that does not appear on their menu. And none of their cocktails cost more than $15 dollars.  Their cocktail menu is divided by cocktail eras, i.e. pre-prohibition, the golden age, etc. I own Tany Abou-Ganim's The Modern Mixologist so I know my stuff. So anything you order from their menu will be divine. And if by chance nothing on the meu speaks to you, you can tell the bartender what type of liquor you drink and give him an idea of what you are looking for in a drinks, say mangoes or something sour, and they will make it for you. They are so talented that the other day I went to the bar with a teetotaler and the bartender made her a drink with raspberries and stuff sans alcohol!  The service is also top-notch. We recently went on a friday with a large party and did not have reservations (I know, how dumb of us). The hostess informed us that the wait for a table was 45 minutes. 2 hours after we were barely being seated. At that point their happy hour had ended. We asked the waiter if he could offer it to us nonetheless and he checked and they did! Mind you, it was not their fault we hadn't made a reservation and thus missed their happy hour specials. So I think it was pretty cool of them to offer it to us. By this time we were super hungry and we all ordered steaks. They were delicious! I had mine with a martini, wonderful!   Check this place out if you want affordable, hand-crafted cocktails.",

The quality of the ingredients and the preparation make this a place worth eating.  You should come for the cocktails. If you like a good cocktail this is easily one of the best places in Vegas. They carry spirits and cordials that most bartenders haven't heard of. The preparation is generally spot on.  They have some stupid rules about splitting checks with large parties. That is enough to keep me from eating there in a large group ever again.",

I had a sprite, but my husband enjoyed the cocktail he had tremendously. He raved about it even after we left. The steaks were awesome & we had the asparagus & macaroni & cheese. Unfortunately, or asparagus was undercooked, but the rest of the meal was fantastic. The music was up too loud & didn't match the vibe or mood of the place. It has a very mob feel to it... Like a speakeasy..... The music..... Not at all.  Anther reason it lost a star is because our waiter was not a very good listener. When he first came around to take our drink orders, I was ready, but my husband wasn't. I asked if I could get a sprite & he smiled at my husband & said \"I'll just give you guys some more time.\" Our waiter wasn't even really a waiter..... The girls from the front f the house brought us everything, even filled my water & sprite twice because our waiter didn't come check on us. He showed up at the last second with our bill & we weren't even done as we were thinking of staying for some cocktails.   Hopefully just a hick up, but we will definitely be back, maybe not for e restaurant service, but for the bar service.",

    "text": "This is a review of their Happy Hour.  The Skinny: overall, the food's not bad - but could use some refinement (3.5) Service: pretty good but we also hit the Happy Hour as soon as they started (3.5) Value: not bad during Happy Hour but seems rather expensive during regular hours.  We walked into Herbs and Rye and immediately felt like we were in some sort of vampiric den. No windows, not much light, my hubby and I squinted as we tried to read the menus. Not to mention being blinded every time the door was opened.  We were seated promptly being the first ones there. We ordered an arugula salad, the gnocchi and the steak with a side of truffled mac 'n cheese.  The arugula salad was okay - but nothing special. The peppery flavour of the lettuce was rather unbalanced - requiring more acidity. It really needed something sweet to even those aggressive flavours out. Perhaps beets or fruit or something.  The gnocchi was delicious albeit it was slightly overcooked (I felt it was a little on the softer side). It was light and fluffy which is really hard to find. The ragu was also quite tasty and mellow. I didn't think that the gnocchi dish was improved with the addition of bacon and could do without it.  The steak was fine- cooked properly. The side of truffled mac 'n cheese was okay but not great. The sauce was a little too runny while the cheese overwhelmed the truffle flavour a bit.  Overall, the dining experience would rate a 3. Just the gnocchi alone would get a 4. So we'll average it and call it a 3.5 star review.",

Very cool and dark and love the way it's decorated.    The drinks were strong and moderately-priced, but to be honest, I was not as impressed with the happy hour food menu.  I expected the majority of the menu to be 50% off and that wasn't the case.  The things I wanted, Bruschetta and Calamari, were not 50% off but I got them anyway.  And I'm glad I did.  Both great and far better than I expected from bar food.  The service was really great too.  We met the owner while we were here, and he seemed like a cool dude.

If you want a nice non-tourist experience for dinner, this may be your place in Vegas. You may need to wait for a few minutes for a cab, but the restaurant will arrange it for you.",

    "text": "First time visiting this place and I can't believe I drive by here nearly every day and hadn't checked it out yet.  Props to the Yelp friends for cluing me in on this place.  The decor inside is pretty amazing...I don't even know how to describe it.  Dark, gothic, speakeasy?  I don't know but whatever it is works great.  My friend and I came in here one evening at about 9:30 for a late dinner after work.  The lot is always full when I drive by; partly due to being somewhat small and partly because it seems everyone besides me knows how great this place is.  For this first visit I had one of their micro brew drafts (can't even remember the name); it was dark similar to Newcastle but better.  I also had one of their flatbreads and a house salad.  I try to keep it simple when going to new place so that I'm not disappointed (read: pissed) if I order something crazy and expensive and it turns out to be disappointing.  The food lived up to its reputation...everything tasted great, was fresh and presented nicely.  Service wasn't too shabby either however I did notice the bartender spending more time chatting with the hostess's than the guests...can't say I blame him, they were easy on the eyes but just saying people do notice this and can be off-putting to some.  Will return for another meal sometime soon.",

Hats off to Emily- most talented mixologist we've found. Not only is their cocktail menu extensive, but if I'm undecided, I just tell Emily what I'm looking for and she's got it down. I've yet to be disappointed. My personal favorites I've had thus far are the Sloe Gin Fizz, Pina Colada (blender free and the best I've ever had), and Beachcomber. Last night we also ventured into food. The filet mignon sliders and bisteca flatbread are on point. The sliders alone might be the best thing I'v ever eaten. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Keep in mind: it gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights between 7 and 9pm. Make sure you grab a seat at the bar or table before or after those times because unless you have a reservation you'll be waiting awhile.",

They are starting to feature live music but the volume doesn't over power the ambiance of the place.  We ordered the calamari...one of the best I've had in the valley. It didn't have your typical marinara sauce, but instead was tossed with slivers of banana peppers and an aoli sauce...excellent. For the main course we had the sirloin (they recommended the rib-eye but had ran out by then) and the fettucini \"crabonara\". We didn't feel rushed and the food came out perfect.  Definitely coming back here again to try everything else. Their menu items weren't your typical italian fair and they served probition era type drinks and cocktails which were interesting...it also helped they were 50% off.",

He got a steak with a side of truffle mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes (with a blood and sand coctktail) and I got the angel hair pasta (with Vieux Carr'e cocktail). EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. He and I shared everything and we just about died with how delicious, flavorful, and well cooked everything was. The truffle mac and cheese is to die for. If I had to have a last meal, I'd definitely come here..and drink all their alcohol because the cocktails we had were so well made as well. Our server Mike had only been there for 3 weeks, but he was exceptional. Very nice and welcoming and he explained everything to us. He was funny as well. This place is worth the money. We will definitely come back again, happy hour or not. Loved it!",

    "text": "Mixed Review for Service and Food. Parking is horrid, parked 2 blocks away, not located in the best area. Huge waiting line out front, lucky we had reservations. My husband and I went for a nice evening out during their Happy Hour from 5-8 PM, when steaks are half price. Reservation requested \"quiet table.\" Seated in the corner, so far, so good, 2 minutes later they seat a group of 10 guys on a boys night out/business dinner right next to us. I asked to be moved but they had nothing that was any better. The place is very loud and you can barely hear yourself think. Server was cordial, but busboy delivered warm bread to every other table around us, including the one next to us before us and by the time we got our bread, the meal was already delivered. We both ordered the ribeye and mine was to have sauteed mushrooms and onions topper. My husband's steak was average and mine was so marbled that there was a glaze of fat on my plate that shined in the dim lighting. Mushroom and onion topper was primarily onions. Apparently, they do not believe in seasoning the steak as it was bland. The server did not offer to send it back for another one, just brought me the salt and pepper shaker, no fresh cracked available. Only saving grace was the Truffle Mac and Cheese which was delicious, but I have no idea why \"truffle\" was in the name as I could not detect anything truffle related. Cocktail was good. Bar was packed with younger crowd. Place only has 1 bathroom for both sexes and had a very long line. Price was good but I had the impression from the server that they were doing us a favor by allowing us to purchase a $54.00 steak for $27. Dinner out was still $100 and I left there unimpressed.",

The atmosphere was pretty cool, but ruined by painfully slow service, and servers who had poor fine dining etiquette. We all ordered steak and most ordered a simple side of mac & cheese or mashed potatoes and I really started getting nervous as the time passed... A half an hour later our food came out in 3 separate groups with at least 5 minutes between each one. I ordered a medium rare flat iron steak and my food came out last. As soon as the server set down my plate I immediately cut all the way through the center and.......hockey puck....well done with not a drop of juice.... I was practically insulted... After a quiet \"sorry about that\", and once everyone was done with their food I received a replacement steak that was delicious and cooked to medium rare, however it did not make up for the fact that I had waited forever just to have everyone in my group ready to leave watching me eat my steak. We received 2 desserts to share between 8 people, I guess this was their way of trying to make up for a horrible night....   Due to the reviews I may give this place one more try if I happen to be in the area, but only during happy hour because the prices do not justify the service and experience provided. Most likely I will not be going back and I would not recommend it to anyone else...",

Also had the little neck clams which were amazing and the spinach parpadelle pasta which was prepared great and tasted delicious!cocktails were on point, unique and tasty. The trance music was a little off putting with the classic speakeasy vibe, i felt like it clashed. Being in the service industry I'm a big fan of friendly and knowledgeable servers, I think our girl was named dawn or Donna and she was super sweet.It did, however, take awhile for me to get a second cocktail and for us to get the check. When we first got there the hostess said we could sit at the bar and we would have a table shortly, but they forgot about us and my boyfriend had to go remind them. Those are the only things keeping it from being perfect though, definitely coming back and definitely into the atmosphere and good food!",

I ordered my second cocktail before we got entrees and it didn't come until I was almost finished my meal! It did take a little too long for drinks that night. I'd go back to try it out again, but if I get the same service, that would be their last chance. I do have to say the desserts were really great!

The house red ale is surprisingly crisp and flavorful, and the Brown Derby was a really great shaken drink. My wife got a really good off-menu jalapeno/gin concoction. She loved the Brussels sprouts. The Caesar salad was pretty small for the price, with three leaves of uncut romaine; but the dressing was really good. I'd love to go back there, its definitely worth driving 12 off the strip.",

Walking inside felt like we went back in time. The dark rooms & mood lighting made our handcrafted cocktails taste that much better. Neo was our server and he couldn't have been any more attentive. The appetizers he offered (the meatballs & mushroom risotto) were amazing. We then had the Filet Mignon under happy hour pricing (half off!!) and it just melted in our mouths. For dessert Neo surprised us with these sugared mini funnel donuts with caramel drizzled on top for our Anniversary. I was already full. But it was too good to not eat!! I highly recommend coming here for a date night, night out with friends and family, or even a business meeting.",

    "text": "Found this gem of a place. Doesn't look like much from the outside. We were a little concerned, but the lot was full on a Monday night. So we felt a lot better when we pulled in. When you step in it's got a lot of ambience, low lighting lots of wood, a large old wood bar. The bar man looked straight out of the old west with his Grizzley Addms beard. Very good drinks. The dining room was classy with a nice 50's steakhouse feel. Low lighting and plenty of dark corners for a romantic night out. Mike & Rob took very good care of us. The French Onion soup plentiful, and great flavor. Definitely enough to share. Monday thru Saturday all steak are half priced from 5 to 8pm, and 12 to 3am. We had the 18oz ribeye, my friend had theirs with the blue cheese crust. Both were extremely good. To finish the night we shared a Cream Brulee, it was buttery, and creamy the perfect end to a great meal. If you are coming to Vegas and looking for a great steakhouse with that old time tradition, and one that won't break bank, this is the place. I can't say enough about Herb and Rye. Thank you Mike and Rob for a memorable night out.",

    "text": "I had a lovely time at Herbs and Rye ! Our server Joe, from Massachusetts, was super helpful and hospitable from beginning to end. He even gave us a list of recommendations for strip clubs, where to get the best chicken fingers and of course other top notch restaurants.  A group of 9 celebrating a friend's bachelorette party in Vegas enjoyed every bit of our experience here. My cocktail of choice to start was the French 75 which was absolutely delightful! I have a thing for drinks with champagne. The clear favorite and most popular were the Ramos Gin Fizz that looked like a Pina colada from a far.  The apps included two sets of their spicy meatballs - these bad boys were very well seasoned and oversized, bruschetta caprese with mozzarella and an eggs and bacon flatbread pizza.  Family style seemed to be most appropriate to share and get a great sampling of what the menu had to offer.  We had the 60oz King Kong Rib-eye which comes with 3 sides along with a NY strip and the Filet Mignon. At first, I was like we are not going to finish this but we definitely handled it.  The 3 sides we choose to accompany the Rib eye were the truffle mac and cheese, spinach, and truffle fries. The sides were much smaller than I think most of us expected but there was enough to go around.  For dessert, we, of course, enjoyed their complimentary beignets as a celebratory treat for the bachelorette! And to top it off we each took a shot of Fernet!  Great experience and we definitely paid for it as it was not cheap! Well,  I guess when in a Vegas, you gotta live it up!!",

    "text": "We visited this place on our last jaunt to the City of Sin.  After reading up on it, we followed the tips of other Yelpers and showed up at exactly at our Midnight reservation spot on Thursday night/Friday morning.  We still had to wait a good 15 minutes past that (at the bar) to get our table.  So, we had a drink at the bar and enjoyed the great atmosphere, music, and people watching.  There are mostly locals in there, which is exactly what we were hoping to find.    When we got sat in a booth right behind the bar (best possible spot), we ordered our half off mussels and half off steaks.  The mussels came out first.  I usually can't tell much of a difference in mussels from one place to the next (kind of like raw oysters) because every place does the clear/garlicky broth the same.  The sauce on these is tomato based with a TON of extra flavor.  I asked for more bread just to soak it all up.  That sauce was surprisingly the highlight for me, even though all the food was excellent.  The steaks we're prepared exactly as ordered and very good.  They were not Prime cuts, but still very flavorful, tender, and delicious.... I'd bet very selective Choice cuts.   I had the Clover Club: gin (even though I typically don't care for it), lemon, raspberry syrup, egg white...and it was AMAZING.  I usually like to try a variety of drinks, but it was so good, I didn't want to risk being let down after, so I had another of the same.  And another.  My husband had something similar to a Manhattan but with anise in it.  He wasn't aware nise tastes like black licorice (I was in the restroom when he ordered it), so the bartender swapped it out for him to another drink that was similar but without it.  He was satisfied, but had beer the rest if the stay there.  Overall, a 4.5.  It is a great little local find with excellent atmosphere, food, drinks, decor, and HH prices.  The bartender was not that friendly of a person and the extra wait beyond our reservation time won't always be ideal for others.  They should focus on those two things if they want it to be perfect, but it was already close.  I highly recommend seeking it out (at the midnight Happy Hour time) and would be happy to go back.",

Mine was okay, nothing spectacular, it needed a hint of sweetness because it was more tart than anything. The Blood & Sand wasn't what my husband expected, he was expecting something less fruity but said it was not bad.  He ordered the filet mignon (blue cheese crusted) with a side of Mac & cheese and I had the Yard Bird & Risotto. The steak was good but nothing out of this world, though I do feel we can't complain for half off ($26 + $3.75 for the blue cheese) and my chicken was pretty dry and flavorless. We had heard so many good things about this place from people we personally know, so perhaps this night was just a fluke. We were the only ones in the dining room, and felt nearly invisible at times as the servers were mostly in the bar area.",

I'm not joking when I yell you I had a 75$ meal for under 30. Mike, our waiter, was super friendly, down to earth, and happily described the menu for us. My friend and I got the filet and her guest got the prime rib. All of us enjoyed our steak so much. I will say it's the best steak I've had in a year ! The mashed potatoes were perfectly creamy , the sprouts were delicious, and the truffle Mac n cheese was gone by time we looked up from our steak.

Now I come here all the time.  The place feels kind of divey on the outside, and is pure heaven when you walk in. It's absolutely gorgeous on the inside, with a great steakhouse/speakeasy feel. A great place for date night.  From 5pm till 8pm, all one step well drinks are $5, and all steaks are half off. The ribeye is incredible, large, and can be split between 2 people. The Whiskey potatoes, button mushrooms, and the jalepeno creamed corn are our go-to sides. If you're looking for an appetizer, just go for the wedge salad-- the bacon on it... Just trust me on this.  We usually try to make it here at around 4:45 so we can snag a seat at the bar to share a ribeye, and conversation with their incredible bartenders. (They're known for their bartenders being legit).  The food is incredible, the vibe is incredible, the bartenders are incredible and you better believe when they open Cleaver, that place will be incredible!   Ok... I'm not a fan. I'm a groupie; and I'm OK with that. This place is dope, and they do dope shit. (Shout out to our fav bartender Spotty).",

Thank you for the great service you provide!",

We had sliders (amazing!), Pork and figs (trust me on this one, it's delicious!), but my favorite by far is the Kitchen Sink (sort of like a seafood stew)... just the right level of spice.... it was awesome! I would go back just for that in a heartbeat.  The risotto was ok, but definitely not their best dish. The atmosphere was way too loud and crowded for me and parking is atrocious. However, must say the service was awesome! If you don't mind fighting for a parking spot and crowed loud places, you'll love it here. For me, the great service and delicious food make it totally worth-while!",

I certainly don't see the draw here, when there are so many great places to eat in the valley, like Echo and Rig, which has better food and atmosphere. Then they added in a 24% tip to the check using the before happy hour prices.  It's hard to walk away without feeling like you have been fleeced. I won't be back.",

He really tied our culinary journey together. I had the Ribeye with whiskey shallot potatoes, while my dining partner had the blue cheese crusted pork chops with fig.

We got both the clams and mussels which were half off during happy hour (from 5-8pm every night!) as well as a variety of different cocktails. The mussels were spicy and soaked in a delicious garlic sauce, that was so delicious, that we asked for extra bread so that we could sop it all up. The clams were drastically different in a creamy butter sauce, but equally delicious!  The cocktail menu is a work of art and a history lesson all in one. Along with the ingredients of each drink, the menu also details how the drink was originally created, and when. With so many choices, we had some difficulty choosing, but the waiter was ready with the recommendations, and he chose a perfect drink for each of our tastes.",

I pulled up a seat near one of the wells a very friendly bartender named Emily took care of me. She was very nice. I tried two cocktails on their list a Frisco which I'd never had before and a Widows Kiss ( my very favorite cocktail that many bartenders dont know or don't have the ingredients in their bar to make). I love the Widows Kiss. I'd never had a Frisco before and didn't love the flavor profile but it wasn't a bad drink ( just not for me). I also had a flat bread with steak and arugula that was very good.  Not only were the drinks good and the staff friendly they drinks are almost half of what you'd pay for a drink on the strip and they are solid. I'll be back here for sure.",

I had high hopes for this place based on 2 friends who have gone during happy hour for the steak and I was not let down at all from the moment the 'Littleneck Clams' hit my tongue. My date and I also ordered the 'Spicy Mussels' which were also delicious, since both of these seafood appetizers were on happy hour. I did not choose a drink from the amazing time period cocktail list. I was looking for a certain taste for my cocktail choice and the waiter suggested a fine cocktail not on the list and I absolutely loved it! We ordered two '14oz New York Steak Strips', one with 'Peruvian Chimichurri' and one with 'grilled onions'. If you ordered one steak to split, they will charge you $7. For our sides, we got 'Garlicky Spinach' and 'Truffle Mac & Cheese'. EVERYTHING was cooked perfect and every bite had me weak in the knees and melting on the table. We were so distracted by our food that we barely touched our drinks until we were done eating. We were so full that we didn't try their dessert. You don't have to sit at the bar to enjoy their happy hour menu. I like the dim lighting and the way the restaurant/bar is set-up. The service was great and quick. There were maybe 25-30 other guests there around midnight. We will definitely be back!",

If you let them, they're really good about getting a feel for your flavor palette, and then being innovative with your drinks. They've got a huge assortment of beers and spirits.  Friday and Saturday nights can get a little busy if you're coming for the bar, especially during their happy hour every night from 5-8pm. I suggest coming early, or right around 7 when the first crowd is finishing up at the bar. It's half off several drinks and some appetizers, but I really go for the muscles and steak. $30 ribeye steak and I'm there. It's not the greatest, but it's decent, and you can get it rare (real rare, which some places skimp on). I've also tried it with their house rub, which is pretty good.  Definitely the place I go when I want a good happy hour for some steak, muscles, and excellent craft cocktails. Don't know that I'd come for the food at full price though, to be honest, haha!",

I ordered the Bees Knees cocktail that was made with gin, honey and lemon.  It had just the right touch of sweet and sour.  I normally don't care for lemon drinks but this one was delicious and not overpowering.   For food, we shared the caprese salad and the pork & figs. The salad was stacked with delicious mozzarella, thick tomatoes and the biggest basil leaves I have ever seen!  The pork chop is topped with melted blue cheese and lays on a bed of mashed potatoes paired with balsamic figs. We almost wish we didn't share this dish!  So yummy and perfectly balanced!  Our meal was finished off with their decadent homemade donuts. They are pretty sugary...but very delicious!!

Even if it was rare, it still had that burnt flavor.  Perhaps too much flames touching the steaks?  Who knows.  Second, the steak needed more flavor... salt.  I had to salt each piece I cut, which made it a lot better.  Third, wife ordered a medium done pork chop, it came out rare to medium rare, had it sent back to be recooked, and it came back well done.  Oh wells, at least the service was good, and we had a decent experience.",

We went at happy hour (which is 5-8 every night) and sat at the bar. The bartender was great and introduced us to Japanese Scotch Whiskey...what??? As well as a number of other drinks.

The drink selection is awesome and I cannot wait to try them all.  My fiance and I shared a caprese salad which tasted great. I really like how sweet and thick the balsamic sauce was. I ordered a filet mignon with a blue cheese crust and the steak was great. We ordered truffle fries and asparagus for our sides and both tasted amazing.  I really cannot wait to go back. It is a great date spot and I could really come here eery night for a post-work drink.

The service is always great and Gerrardo / G (the bartender) is quite knowledgeable with the cocktails and always accommodating. He alone, deserves 5 or more stars!  This is definitely NOT the place to go to for the froufrou, sweet, flower decorated drinks one commonly finds on the strip, at the hip club of the moment.  This is THE place to go to for some seriously dang good cocktails, made traditionally... just like the days during  Prohibition.   My husband and I love that they stay True to the era and only have spirits that was available back then. It's a history lesson on alcohol!  We have never ever been disappointed with the drinks.... they are always delicious and well made.   The food, on our very first visit, was hit or miss. We came with a group of 10...... the group ordered the filet, mussels, several of the various flat breads and calamari. My girlfriend and I couldn't decide on what we wanted, so G asked us what we were in the mood for and ensured it would be made.  We asked for shrimp with linguine. (Thank you G! Excellent customer service!) The linguine, mussels and flat breads were very good!  In fact, we wanted more pasta. However, the steaks were over cooked and dry... and the calamari was not crisp and very chewy.   The next time we visited, we had a group of 17 and it was a blast! All of our drinks were fantastic and the food was delicious. No complaints from anyone we were with. My favorite that night was the chorizo meatballs and sweet potato tater tots. YUM!!   I recently went with a girlfriend who had never been and she was impressed. We sat at the bar.... and of course, G took very good care of us.  We took a chance and ordered the calamari (after all, we are human and the chef from the first night may have had an off day) and the clams. Both dishes were excellent! The calamari was nice and crisp, topped off with some crunchy prosciutto and a light sauce. And the clams.... we could not get enough of it. The broth was the highlight of the dish! Perfect for dunking bread in.  I've tried many of the drinks from their cocktail list and my favorite is the Leap Year.  Cheers!!",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem of Vegas. Area is sketchy, but venue is pristine. Early 1900s music and feel, herbs and rye had the best ambiance with its dark mood setting that's intimate, yet social.  Ordered pork and fig and fillet mignon with truffle Mac and broccoli and sharp cheddar.  No regrets at all.  Dessert offerings were limited to a root beer float, cookie and ice cream, and fresh donuts. I skipped dessert.   I would go here and recommend it anytime to anyone looking for great value and high quality, without the tourist trap prices of the strip.",

    "text": "My coworkers and I made plans to visit Herbs and Rye after work to partake in their reverse happy hour. I was extremely excited and pleased upon entering. The decor is downright cool. The bar looks like a lab conducting experiments! My coworkers were at the bar waiting for them to get our table ready. Once it was ready we took our seats. We weren't given any menus so we just sat there a while. As soon as our server finally came over to fill waters we asked for menus. A majority of the 10 people at our table ordered off of their hand crafted cocktail list. It seemed to take FOREVER for our drinks and our server didn't use the time to take appetizer or dinner orders to help....now our entire table was full of servers from a steakhouse so we remained calm and understood what was up. I was 5th to order and I went with a medium rare ribeye and my side was the Mac n cheese. We ordered the calamari and little neck clams for our apps. And we all ordered different sides to have variety to share. So the clams came out and they were AMAZING! I could dip bread in that sauce for the rest of my life!! After a while our food starts coming out....calamari showed with dinner. So they brought out the first 4 people's food first then the next tray had the other 5 people's food.....where's my food? Everyone was eating and our server never came back to check on us so I couldn't tell her anything!!! I didn't want to make a scene but finally 15 minutes later she comes with my food. No I know this is a small restaurant so maybe they didn't have enough room to cook my steak. But I had ordered in the middle and she never came to let us know it's on its way or anything. And worse off 5/8 steaks ordered were over done. Our sides were AMAZING and the calamari was different and GREAT. But our steaks were sad :( and my Mac was gritty and didn't taste very good, no one at it....so we had asked about dessert before we had ordered food and because of the pics on here I knew I wanted those doughnuts!!!!!! So we ordered 2 doughnuts and 2 cookie things. She came back and said no doughnuts whaatataaaaaat you just told us there were doughnuts!!!! So we get our cookies and they are obviously burned. To the point if I had been serving it I wouldn't have let it touch the table.   Will I return? Probably! For doughnuts and for clams and brussel sprouts. Not for steaks or to sit at a table. We'll stick to the bar.",

Both were very strong and tasty but I preferred the Jack rose. Enjoy! it was a great steak place!",

We ordered the linguine and clams and the truffle Mac and cheese which were mediocre. We came here around midnight on a Friday night for their happy hr from 12am-3am. The bar was packed so we had to get a table which is fine, but it was so ridiculously loud in there that you can't even hear the person next to you. This is primarily because of the rowdy people at the bar. Then there's really no explanation of the happy hr on the menu so we thought this included cocktails...which it doesn't. Also, they don't even have prices for them on the menu....strange. Cocktails weren't great anyway, I didn't even finish mine. Would I recommend this place? No. Maybe I would try this place again just for their steak, but not for drinks or ambiance.",

The bartenders really know how to make drinks and are more than sociable if you want to talk.  The place to sit is at the bar, during happy hour if you can snag a seat.  It can definitely get crowded but the food specials and the expertise of the bartenders is a site to behold.  The drinks are tasty and strong and the food is equally impressive.  The bone-in pork chop was easily one of the best pieces of pork I have ever had!  Definitely try it, especially during happy hour; it is a steal!",

    "text": "Cool spot with some killer cocktails!  I love it when bartenders take their craft seriously and drinking becomes an experience. This place doesn't fail and when we walked in around 8pm on a Friday night the bar was packed and the restaurant had a 30 min wait; deservingly so.  The bartenders are great and it has a very cool vibe with friendly locals who are happy it's finally Friday! Two couples moved around to fit my man and I immediately as we walked in and that was a really nice gesture. We had several cocktails and definitely began feeling tipsy on drink two. Pretty pathetic but these suckers were strong!   After a short time we were called for our table and we were starving! Everything tastes better when you're tipsy! Well almost everything!   So let's get to the food. Started with a margarita flat bread which was good (still on my search for amazing margarita pizza) and then the filet sliders. These were by far the highlight of the experience. The meat was so tender with caramelized onions, horse radish sauce on a very soft potato bun (AMAZING)! Then we wanted something decadent and decided on the penne. It was so salty we couldn't take more then a few bites. It tasted like eating spoons full of salt. As tipsy as I was I couldn't do it. We told our waitress and she was kind enough to ask if we wanted it remade but we decided to skip as we wanted to save ourselves for something sweet. That dish was straight up nasty. We ordered the hot donuts and they made up for the pasta! Overall good food but that penne really screwed us up. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was over that.  The service was great. Strong cocktails to get a nice buzz going and maybe we just got unlucky with the pasta. Everything else was good.  The decor is cool with a very back in the day feel when the cool kids were bootlegging in dark places. I would definitely try this place again.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to try out the Happy Hour at Herbs & Rye for as long as it's been open.  Last night we finally timed it right.  But I can't remember ever being as woefully disappointed in a HH menu as I was here.  First, the good:   -- The ambience.  Loved it - all that dark wood, flocked wallpaper, cozy, dimly-lit, romantic.    -- The service. Our waiter, Ronny, couldn't have been more attentive and patient.  But it went downhill quickly when we realized that there was nothing on that HH menu that would work for us.  The wine was a piss-poor selection of just a couple of whites or reds that neither of us would drink.  The beer?  What bar has NOTHING on tap???  I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband wasn't blown away either by the selections or prices.  As for the food, the only two HH appetizers available were clams or mussels.  We don't eat either of them.  Flatbreads (not on HH)?  The price for the one with steak was the same as one with just tomatoes. What a concept. We weren't about to bite, knowing we can get the same tomato and cheese flatbread at Kona Grill HH for nearly 2/3 less.  Sure, it's not the same atmosphere, but you can't always eat the atmosphere.  The only main course available was linguine with clams.  Not clam sauce, which I (but not hubby) would eat, but clams, just like in the appetizer.  I'm shell-averse.  I don't like to work for my food; if I did, I'd have stayed home and cooked.  The steaks would have been okay, if we were craving a juicy steak.  We never crave juicy steaks, and had already exceeded our beef quota for the week.  We weren't about to exceed it just because it was there, since it's never a first choice for us anyway.  In the end, we had our drinks - a low-end beer for Herb and a very good non-HH Riesling for me - and then went for pizza, and it was infinitely more satisfying.",

Mark was so patient and awesome.  It was late and lowered in there and it was a bunch of young people in there... was a really cool hip bar but I didn't expect the price to be as expensive as they were so I just had the beef tartare and shared bread pudding with my other guest.  Food was yummy.  Seriously Mark if you're reading this you're awesome and I'm sorry you're last table of the night was a yucca table!!",

The cocktail menu was long and really interesting. It's broken down by era which is a cool concept I haven't seen. Isiah the bartender made me an excellent sazerac and a variation of a whisky sour that were excellent. The steak I had was incredible as were the sides. Our server Allie was not only nice and lovely but knew a ton about bartending and provided some great drink recommendations. The only thing I would recommend is making reservations, you'll never get walk in seats on a Friday or Saturday. Oh and good luck finding parking. Overall this place was awesome, I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  I have to preface this review and rate the bar/drinks separately than the food.  The bartenders were exceptional and the food was very good for the half off, Happy Hour price, but not wroth the actual price.  The bar was a 5 star no doubt, while the food was 4 stars.  I ordered 3 separate drinks while dining at Herbs & Rye.  Each time I asked for a certain type of alcohol and they surprised me with a delicious concoction.  The menu is extensive by itself, but I always love getting unique, unknown drinks from great bartenders when possible.  Trust me, the drinks are top notch, but on par with strip prices ($12).  The food was very solid as well.  I had the rib eye and a side of brussel sprouts.  Since it was Happy Hour the steak was half off, but I don't think it was worth the full asking price of $40+.  If it wasn't for the great half off prices for my steak, I think I would have rated the meal portion of my visit lower.  Overall I enjoyed my dinner very much.  For a cocktail, this is the place to go.  The bqrtenders are friendly, knowledgable, and on top of their mix drink game.  The food was solid at Happy Hour prices (5-8pm), but a bit high for a regular night out on the town compared to similar Vegas strip steak restaurants.  Herbs & Rye is close enough to the strip to warrant a trip.  I definitely recommend a visit.",

First off I would like to say our waiter Ronny, was one of the best waiters I have ever had! The place was jammed packed and he took care of us like we were his only customers. Great service!!! Always checking on us to see if we needed anything. Answered many of my questions about different dishes. Hours food was served, the late night happy hour etc. He had a huge party of men next to us who were having dinner with lots of drinking. We do not drink. Even though Ronny knew the bill and tip was going to be greater at the other table, he made sure he took care of us first with special attention. This did not go unnoticed by us.      The food was delicious. My NY Strip ordered medium rare was perfectly cooked and the steak itself juicy and rich. My wife's Filet was tender. We had truffle mac and cheese that was wonderful as was the garlic mashed.     The busboy was also hardworking, polite and very helpful to us and the waiter.     All in all, I highly recommend Herbs and Rye. A great dining   experience.",

    "text": "Herbs & Rye was one of those late dinners with Terri R that was on a whim.  Herbs & Rye looks like a pub on the outside, even has that feel when you walk in. All I know is that it was a very long day, I was starving, and anything that was food would have hit the spot.  In other words, I didn't expect much coming in. Maybe a good thing that I didn't expect much because I was actually surprised by the menu.  I expected nothing but fried dishes or meals with zero sustenance. What I found was a menu ranging from apps to steaks.  Prices are not pub prices though.  Price here is what you are to expect at a steakhouse.  A ton of really tempting items on this menu like Filet Mignon and Lobster, Burgers, and other steak options.    With all the recent talk about White Castle here in Vegas for the last couple of days (compliments of the Foodie Fest), I decided on their sliders.  The presentation of these sliders is probably the best I've seen in awhile.  It at least kicks White Castle's butt.  I thought that the sliders were pretty good, but just a little rich.  We also got their fully loaded calamari.  To me, I thought it was one big workout killing mess.  It had a ton of what appears to be mayo, bacon, and some other add ons.  Both Terri and I, scraped off this mess and ate some calamari the way it should be eaten.    As for the ambiance, you can say that you get two types.  When you walk in, you have the bar to the right where all the action is.  It's louder, brighter, and this is where everyone else is eating.  Then you got the quiet side where it's dimmer, quiet, and barely where anyone is dining.  Normally, I'm good with either side. But on this night, the dining was a little too tight on the bar side. So, we ate where it was quieter and darker.  Since it was also late, keeping ourselves from falling asleep was a challenge in itself.  My other concern is that we would be forgotten and our orders never taken.  This wasn't an issue at Herbs & Rye.  Regardless which side you choose to eat, service seems to be right on.   Overall, Herbs & Rye is a decent place to meet with friends, grab a drink, and some dinner.  I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general, but I still have my favorites.  Herbs and Rye can easily be one of them.    PS:  I don't drink, but there's a some great Happy Hour specials here.  For all you HH dudes and gals, give this place a try.

This place is old school and the service is excellent what you would expect from the 50-60s.  They specialize in cocktails. The drink menu is actually divided by year the drink was popular back starting in the early 1700s.  It is said Frank Sinatra came here to eat and drink. I would suppose the rest of the rat pack was here also.  The ambiance is dark, bring your phone or small flashlight if you have problem reading in low light.  Don't let the outside fool you. The place has obviously been a go to place for many years.",

They also poured a good glass of bourbon even though it was on the pricier side.  Total came to $82 for two peoples dinner and a glass of Blantons bourbon. We will be back for sure.",

He was able to explain the menu to us inside and out in vivid detail.  He suggested to do the linguine and clams in a marinara sauce which had us suspicious at first, but given his previous spot on recommendations we decided to take the chance.  It was superb!

The draw was 1/2 off steaks and 1/2 off on one or two other entrees that weren't steaks.  We ordered a NY, a ribeye and a pasta/chicken dish.  The NY was good and the pasta/chicken had to be sent back as it was dry, not enough sauce.  I had the ribeye which I can't even say was a ribeye, it was more of a NY.  I questioned our server and he told me it was a ribeye, even went to the kitchen to confirm with the chef.  My ribeye was not the typical ribeye you get served, in fact, this was the first time I've ever ordered a ribeye that looked and chewed like a NY!  There was no lip and half ring of fat, just the loin (or filet) portion of the ribeye.  There was nothing special about the steak and would NOT pay full price for any of their steaks.  I've had better steaks elsewhere and don't need to return if this is what Herbs & Rye calls a ribeye!!",

I dig their happy hour, on which I did not know until it was mention by Mark, our great guy who took down our orders. I wanted to surprised my fiance for his early birthday cause he likes steaks. He enjoyed his ribeye very much, perfect medium rare and it was a huge portion! Everything that has two red stars on the menu are half off for happy hours! The spicy mussels are a must to order. As well as the linguini clam dish on which I ordered. Truffles fries all the way also! Steak cut fries are the bomb! We didn't finish our dinner cause it was a lot! And we did not eat anything all day too.. We pack in to go boxes to bring the rest home. Even the hot fresh donuts that was brought out, desserts w a lit candle dish, on the house cause of my fiance birthda. it was totally awesome and surprised!

Jalapeno cream corn was epic. The meatballs made me want to slap my mom for making bad meatballs.   I loved the food and atmosphere so much but nothing compared to the attentive and professional staff.   Ronnie our server loves the band Rush. I invited him home to meet my sister. Our bartender Matt was professional and funny and had a beard that would make ZZ Top jealous. Joe was funny and made a great drink but his fake Boston accent was a little off putting, but nothing to get mad about.   I loved this place so much I decided to move to Las Vegas and move in with the girl who said hi to me in the parking lot.   Thank you Herbs & Rye for helping me find food and love!",

The service is great.  My wife and I split an 18ounce rib eye, medium.  We got the Herb and Rye sauce on top.  We added thick cut bacon also.  The sauce was great, but took away from the steak itself.  A garlic butter or something else would have been better.  The sides... We got the garlic spinach...  Oh, it was great.  I got the lobster tail, with mash potatoes.  The lobster was about an 8 out of 10.  The mash potatoes were good.  The prices were very reasonable.   The dinner was under $120 for her and I together.  We only drank water.  No adult beverages tonight.  They have two happy hours a night.  All steaks are half off during happy hour.  I wish we would have known.  It was worth the price, as is.  Eat up people!!!",

Great steaks, homemade pastas, amazing sides  And one of the best happy hours around. Half off all the steaks after midnight and they have an early one too i believe.  A hidden gem!",

Made reservations in advance for happy hour (half off of best steaks around) and showed up early on purpouse to sample some great cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table.  Service was fantastic, great selection of some of the best bourbons, whiskeys and scotches.  Steaks were absolute perfection and honestly, other than the excellent craft cocktails, the steaks are THE reason to come here.  Very memorable and best anniversary dinner!",

    "text": "So many good things to say about this place! From drinks to service quality to perfect steaks this place is phenomenal. Unique ambiance with class and style is the best way to describe the atmosphere in this restaurant. I'm a sucker for their specialty crafted drinks and try a different one every time I go and have yet to be let down. My favorite is the Pimms Cup. For apps I love me some garlic and butter Clams as well as some of the best carpaccio I've had. I've never had a bad steak at Herbs and Rye but my favorite is the filet topped with blue cheese and bacon. For dessert the deep fried donuts are a must. If I have people in town i always make it a point to hit Herbs and rye",

Go up to the hostess and ask to put our name on the wait list and she says it will be about 45 minutes (right after they opened at 5pm). So we wait. An hour into it, we ask again and she says about 620pm. We waited until 8pm.. almost 3 hours after and their system went down. People with 7pm reservations have still not been seated. It's a mess. I understand there is a wait, but don't tell people it will be 45 minutes when it will be over 3 hours.",

They recommended some great drinks based on the type of alcohol I enjoy, and the balance of flavor I was looking for.  The appetizers were phenomenal (we had the meatballs and muscles) and then enjoyed the salmon and new strip for our entrees.  We then topped it all off with their doughnut dessert with caramel and cream cheese dipping sauces - so freaking good.  Aside from the great food, the ambiance and excellent service from Christian and Ronnie really made the experience.  It has an old-school lounge feel and apparently has an awesome late night happy hour starting at midnight.  Definitely take the chance to check this place out if you're looking for some great drinks and food outside of the strip.",

He picked people up, got neighbors at the bar socializing, and made a good show of making some of the best drinks I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Do a little googling and notice that the biggest bartenders in Vegas recommend this place for a serious cocktail; then drop in, relax, and let the joy of seriously crafted food, drink, and atmosphere  wash over you.",

We ordered the porterhouse, carpaccio, beef tartar, sweet potato tater tots, and steamed mussels. Seems like a little but the portions are filling. Steak wasn't that great but the tartar was outstanding and the mussel broth was the perfect amount of spicy. Their menu is extensive with four pages of cocktails but with each one we ordered they got progressively worse. We had a Moscow Mule, Incredible Hulk, Ward Eight, and a regular vodka cranberry. I've heard that their bartenders are some of the best in Las Vegas but I was disappointed. I'll definitely come back though. Loved the atmosphere and the late hours. The exterior looks run down but inside reminds me of prohibition with dim lighting and old fashioned decor.  Also they have a happy hour past 12, steaks half off!",

I went here with two friends on Dec 6 after trying to find a good place in Las Vegas off the beaten path. After a little thought we settled on Herbs and Rye for a night of good drinks. While we didn't have a reservation we were able to get an open booth and the service was among the best I have seen at a bar. The drinks were reasonably priced and were among the best we have had, some of my other friends ended up on the strip. I'm pretty happy I ended up at Herbs and Rye. The place is clean, there is easy parking, the place has a great crowd, the service is among the best, and the ambience is perfect.

    "text": "We went there twice on our last trip.  The first time we were part of a group of 6. We got there about an hour and fifteen mins before happy hour ended and we got seated about 20 mins before happy hour ended. There happy hour is good because some of the steaks and a few other things on their menu are half off! While we waited we found an area to hangout around the bar. i personally don't like cocktails, but for people who do they enjoyed the cocktails there. There's no prices for cocktails marked on the menu, but they generally range $11-13.   Our main table was nice. The restaurant didn't seem crowded or loud and our table was spacious. The restaurant decor is nice. I think our server was inexperienced (or just a bad server). One of the people at our table ordered a bottle of wine and the bartender had said they would make sure it got to our table. We asked the server about it a number of times and he seemed to have an issue asking the right questions and being able to get the wine. Overall he was pretty awkward. Three of us ordered pastas and he failed to bring over the complimentary bread until we asked. The issues with the services were annoying, but they weren't a huge deal. The part that definitely made it worse was that since we were in a group of 6 they automatically added the tip onto our bill- and it was on the non happy hour price. I wouldn't mind tipping that amount if the service were good.  But, the service we got did not come close to warranting the size of tip the server got.  The second time we went the service was great. The server was knowledgable. The guy that was helping clear tables and refill waters was exceptional. A water glass wasn't empty for more than 30 seconds before he had it refilled.   As for the food: My boyfriend had a steak and has said it was good, but nothing special. The mashed potatoes he had as a side were ok, but portion was small for the price. Our friends had sides or mac and cheese and that also was small. I had the linguine and clams pasta. It was good but lacked flavour. The main reason I would order it again is that it is on the happy hour menu so it ends up being reasonably prices compared to a lot of other things and since I'm not a steak eater its a good alternative. The spicy muscles were great!! I would definitely try them. I enjoy hot food, and they were spicy but not too spicy. It came with bread which was good for dipping in the spicy tomato sauce. We ordered the pappardelle. It was our mistake because we assumed there was a meat sauce with it. Was rich and had an overpowering garlic taste. Make sure you save room for the donuts. They are plain sugar donuts with two dipping sauces!",

(Gotta take Yelp with a grain of salt) We came in at 11pm sat in the bar booths and missed the happy hour.   Pro: food is generous in portion, even the flatbreads ($14)- 8 huge slices! I'm used to Blue Martinis flat bread which is a rip-off. The mac and cheese  ($7.5) was delicious and cheesy and flavored really well. Caesar salad was beautiful in presentation, but it took work chopping it up. The 3 Filet Mignon sliders were delicious, flavorful and just well put together. As opposed to the dried out sliders at Sugar Factory. I've sworn off the rip-off that are sliders just because of Sugar Factory.  Cons: The Diablo ($10) took forever to arrive- 10 minutes I'd say. It was only 4 people in the bar and we accounted for 2 of them. Not sure if the bartender forgot or maybe he was juicing the Agave?   The server forgot to ask how we wanted our sliders prepared, which arrived medium rare. A real filet mignon is fine med-rare, but a ground up burger med-rare is close to raw.   More specificity on the menu i.e. how many of each item- $11 for a meatball appetizer is unheard of outside of LAVO.  It's 3 meatballs btw.  Overall, Herbs & Rye re-imagines what real food is in Vegas. Not only was I surprised at the complex flavors of the food, but the mood and ambiance of such a quaint unassuming building really makes me want to go back.",

    "text": "Came here because a friend recommended their Happy Hour steaks, and to collect those Open Table points.  H&R is located next to a gas station, and I feel like it's kind of ghetto around the restaurant.  Reservation was for 6pm on Friday.  We arrived a little late because there was no parking in their small lot.  After circling the lot 2 times, we called H&R and they said the next best place to park at is Eyeglass World, 2 lots to the west.    Upon opening the door to the restaurant, you are blasted by a wall of darkness.  We waited for the hostess to get off the phone, then she led us to our table.  BTW, the cushion seat against the wall is SOO much more comfortable than that wooden chair!  It takes your eyes about 20 mins to adjust to the darkness, but it was still very uncomfortable and disorienting to be eating with such dim lighting.  Not to mention that you can hardly see the food you're eating.  I would say the decor is a mix between pool hall meets back alley.    Dishes tried: - Appetizer: calamari ($17) Some server brought this out and immediately my date and I commented on the lack of sauce.  Legit, there was a drizzle of the aioli sauce, or at least from what we could see of the dish.  We ended up asking our waitress for more sauce later on and then she brings out a boatload in a gravy boat.  We could have done with that earlier...  Overall, lacking sauce and overpriced.  - Steaks: Porterhouse and NY Strip steak.  Filet part of the porterhouse was really tasty.  NY Strip steak was on the rare side for the medium requested.   - Sides: waitress said the truffle mac & cheese and jalepeno corn are \"the best\" sides.  We got those with our dishes and boy, were they horrible!  Let me first say that I am a mac & cheese and corn connoisseur, and these sides did not meet my standards.     - Mac & cheese tasted like frozen Stouffer's.  Had that fake not real cheese taste.     - Corn also tasted like frozen corn and towards the end of the meal, the corn texture got thicker.  Yeah, twas gross.   Dude, if I wanted a frozen meal, I would have gone to Trader Joe's.    BOTTOM LINE: I wouldn't even come back here for their happy hour.  Not a pleasant dining experience.",

I had made reservations a month in advance for (8) people at 6:30. The entire party arrived on time and wouldn't be seated until \"everyone was there\".... We waited in the bar for our table while struggling to get attention for a cocktail due to their very popular happy hour.   7pm passed, 7:15 passed...still not seated. Almost an hour after our reservation time we were finally seated. We ordered appetizers right away which came out COLD about 45 minutes later. Our meals didn't come until close to 9:15pm, which were equally cold and disappointing. When the bill came (way after 10pm), the restaurant did the right thing by paying for appetizers and rounds of drinks but they also added 20% gratuity, which was not warranted.   This was a customer dinner with my boss and huge customer. I was embarrassed and reamed by my boss for the evening. There were so many other places to go, and should have chosen:  Huge disappointment. Won't be back. Lost a great customer and a huge previous advocate.",

I would say an older part of town but not bad. Price wise, a little high for the area but this is Vegas.  Service was an little lacking. She was helpful but super busy and didn't check back enough for my standards. I hate having an empty drink glass!! And I also hate when water is poured all over the table while refilling glasses and not cleaned up!!  Food was amazing!! We had the bone-in strip and a filet, the broccoli with cheddar, mashed potatoes, and truffle mac and cheese. All delicious. Tried three cocktails, all delicious. Make sure you ask about flavors if you're not familiar with the the ingredients. Some are very strange!!",

This isn't your typical bar where you're going to get a Redbull vodka (in fact a friend of mine tried to order it and the bar refused to serve it). Their drinks are inspire by the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, so on and so forth. They're make you amazing custom drinks with fresh ingredients as well if you ask.  2. The food on the other hand is okay. It's overpriced and you can get better food elsewhere for the same amount or cheaper. 3 stars on the food.",

The cocktails are unique, and come in an extensive variety. I like that they break down cocktails by time period too.

Everything about it is amazing to me.   The cocktails are so unique and exquisite. I love their Pimms Cup, Pisco Sour, Diablo, Last Word, oh I could name some more but you should go find out for yourself. The discovery of these classic cocktails is such a marvelous occurrence for your taste-buds.   The food is wonderful. The BEST and I will keep saying this until some other place tries to beat them out on it, but seriously the BEST Truffle Mac & Cheese I have ever had. It is one of my favorite dishes. I also enjoy their cobb salad and filet. I have had their flatbreads too. So good.   The bartenders are super talented, especially the owner Nectaly when he gets behind the bar on occasions. Nectaly, Brian, and Michael are the three that really stand out whenever I go. They are friendly, entertaining, and know how to make their drinks.   I have never been bored just sitting there. The atmosphere is dark and mysterious. It makes me feel relaxed and mysterious myself. The music is usually good. The DJ on Saturday nights can be a hit or miss for me, but they do not ruin my mojo when I am there.   Writing this is making me miss it. I think I shall have to get some Mac & Cheese after all my Halloween festivities tonight.   Side note: They close at 2am M-Th, 3am F & S, and completely closed on Sundays.   Thank you everyone at Herbs & Rye for being awesome.",

The food took awhile to come out, not a huge deal but noteworthy.  Several people in our group had problems with the temperature the steak was cooked at.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was rare, which it was better to error on the side or rare as opposed to medium but it was still not what I ordered.  3 other people in our party had similar issues with their cooked temperature being wrong.    The food overall was good and definitely worth the half-off price of the happy hour.  I tried the garlic mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese for sides.  Both were very tasty.    The bussers and assistant servers were much more attentive and helpful than our main server.  The service wasn't bad overall, it just let room for improvement.    We had a reservation and the host was quick to seat us so that was a positive.",

The True test of an establishment is serving the masses without compromising quality and service and Herbs and Rye executes this to perfection.   Joe the bartender was our server for the evening and that was a good thing because the bar did not have any open seats so I felt like it was a fair trade off.  The ambiance is dark but has a really quaint feel to it, with red on the walls and big comfy booths.  The 3 of us started off with some classic libations prepared by the amazing bar staff they have employed there.  Wine with dinner and finished with another cocktail, unfortunately we did not leave any room for desert because the doughnuts are to die for.  Everyone on the table had the strip and we ordered sides to share.  Of course the Brussel sprouts with honey pig, bourbon mashed, truffle mac, garlic spinach and jalapeno creamed corn.   You know those meals that you wished you were home alone in the dark so you can lick the plate? Herbs delivers just that. Don't forget to order appetizers, we didn't this time around but the wings, carpaccio, muscles and the farmer flatbread is probably one of my favorite things to eat.",

Very lively, fun and happy. Steakhouses can be a bit boring and sleepy, but not this joint. There isn't the widest variety of cuts here, but it's good enough for several repeat visits. Lots of good alcohol as well, but no beer on tap... not that this should be a dealbreaker. You could even come here just for the bar.  As far as food goes, the 9oz filet + 9 oz lobster tail seemed to be the best non happy hour deal, so we got that. Very good and flavorful. It did not disappoint. But more than that, I liked the grilled cheese and tomato soup starter the best! It was amazingly tasty and I actually wanted more of that! I highly recommend that if this is your first visit or you've never tried it before. Parking can be a real pain in the ass especially during weekend nights.

When you walk in the atmosphere was more for a romantic date or anniversary things like that for me it was my birthday. We never been here before but the waitress we had was super nice and filled us in on happy hour which is at midnight . Anything with two stars is half off which sounded so much better because it is pricey , anyways we ended up ordering one rib eye to share and side dishes like garlic mash and truffle mac and cheese ( so amazing) and jalapeno corn yummmm and hot wings ( super sauces up ) just how I like.

    "text": "Herbs and Rye is more of a cocktail bar that serves steaks rather than a steakhouse that has a bar, and it is the cocktail bar that surely serves a good steak.  The quailty of Ribeye steak (medium rare) was top notch. It wasn't dry aged therefore it did not have strong flavor but the steak was absolutely amazing  The plate of wings (sweet thai) that was served as an appetizer was tasty and filling. It had a larger portion than expected but i dont think no one would complain extra 3 or 4 more wings. There are two reasons i gave this place 4 tars instead of 5, and one of them is because of the side. The truffle mac and cheese was very mushy. It surely tastes great but the texture could be improved. The second reason that drew me back from giving 5 star was the music. I understand that it was a cocktail bar and needed music to keep the atmosphere upbeat and alive but the music was extremely loud that it was hard to hear my own server.   Overall, this place is a perfect spot for quailty steaks for an affordable price.",

Here's what we got:  Linguine and Clam Pasta 18 oz Ribeye (side: truffle mac and cheese)  The pasta had a very good lemony flavor. I like the sauce and portion size too. The steak was absolutely delicious. Seasoned well and cooked to a perfect medium rare. I would also eat that mac and cheese every day if I could. Just a good mix of cheeses and truffle.   The ambiance is really cool. It's modeled as a speakeasy from the prohibition era. Whoever was controlling the playlist when we were there gets extra points in my book as they played some pretty good hip-hop. Not everyone's cup of tea but definitely mine! Our waiter was very kind and attentive. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone in the area. It's affordable and delicious!",

We came during their happy hour and thank goodness, because the bill would have been almost double, and I am sorry, but the prices they are charging for the quality of food just doesn't match up! I don't mind paying good money for good food, but this was not good. I guess their specialty here is their drinks. So maybe we missed out on the whole \"experience\", we drank wine with dinner, which no complaints about the wine. The problem really was the food. It just wasn't good. The ribeye was cooked properly as far as the medium rare order was placed but there was no flavor, and the texture was bad.  One of the worst steaks I have tasted. As bad as the steak was it was better than the pasta. The penne pasta had a truffle cream sauce and it was really inedible. The cream sauce tasted so bad, it was really not cooked properly at all. The cream was too heavy and was separated. My son had the linguine and clams, he ate all of his dinner without any complaints or issues, my daughter had the angel hair pasta with chicken, and she also did not complain about her dish. I had seen so many good reviews for this place, and I was really looking forward to going. I knew I wanted the ribeye because of all the good reviews. I don't know what happened on the night we went and I doubt I will go back. At least for the food that is, maybe just go for drinks?",

    "text": "I came here for Friendsgiving for the first time and was very impressed. We were seated pretty quickly with plenty of room for our group of 5. The dining room was very dim but late at night it totally worked. They have a kickass happy hour that will definitely bring me back. Because I don't eat red meat(I know why would I come I a place that has mainly steak) I ordered the salmon dish and it was honestly fantastic. The real gem of herbs and rye is their sides though! We ordered the truffle Mac n cheese, the fries and mashed potatoes. If you want to just order sides, I know they wouldn't blame you!  The service was great as well! The bill with drinks and happy hour entrees and some extras was around 240. Great deal to me!  Am I going to come back? Absolutely! Would I recommend for people to go? Heck yes!",

    "text": "Love love love this place! If you have an appreciation for craft cocktails  that range from classic to trendy, you will too! The drink menu is split into different eras (Roaring 20s, 50s, etc.) with the drinks revolving around those categories, and they have PLENTY to choose from with the price range being $10-15. The atmosphere is dark and intimate, but at the same time it isn't intimidating like a bar at the strip of the same caliber. It is definitely a place that you would go to catch up with someone or a small group of people (I'd say 5 max). They have a very nice, fancier dinner menu as well, with more expensive items ranging from $15-30...we didn't eat there, but next time I will be sure to try it. The only thing that I would comment on is their lack of reasonably priced appetizers/bar snacks that would accompany the drinks.",

Meat cooked to perfection, delicious chimchurri and the perfect mai tai (basic I know). The attitudes of the bartenders was the reason I rated this place a 5 instead of a 4- they were friendly, knowledgeable and totally about their craft.

    "text": "Ate at the restaurant on June 23, 2018 with 7:00 pm reservations. We had to wait for them to put some tables together for us as we were a party of 10 and a baby.  Once seated, we were first greeted by the bus person asking about water order.  Next, our waitress Debra came to the table and gave us the run down on the menu, explained the happy hour items, took our cocktail orders and our app orders.  This was the first time for me visiting Herbs & Rye and I had heard good things.  In fact, one of the people in our party is actually related to the owners.  Needless to say, the food and drinks didn't disappoint.    I ordered the New York Strip and the button mushrooms, had a French Onions soup to start, and enjoyed two glasses of Riesling.  Steak was perfectly cooked to med-rare as I requested and tender.  Everyone else ordered various steaks off the happy hour menu and various cocktails.  Because of the portion sizes of the sides and apps, we all shared and I was also able to try the mashed potatoes, the grilled asparagus, the creamed spinach, the shrimp cocktail, and the steamed (spicy) mussels.  Every food item was completely on point!  For dessert the waitress brought out the homemade doughnuts for one person at our table for her birthday.  They were equally delicious if not more so!  Vanilla creme brulee was also amazing.   Everything from the seating, to the server greet, the service, food delivery, and attentiveness of the staff was impeccable.  However, I do have one complaint.  Because we were a party of 10, it states on the menu that you don't do split checks for parties for 7 or more.  Perhaps you should make an exception to this rule because it would make things so much easier for the guests, everyone would know what their portion was and what to pay, and we wouldn't have had to sit there for 25 more minutes trying to figure out what everyone owed on the bill and why some people didn't put in enough money.  By allowing us to split the check would have gave the server back her tables that much quicker, and the restaurant could have turned that table at least one more time.  I get the reason for not splitting the checks (i.e. people walking out on the bills, system freezes up, etc) but sometimes the restaurant should make an exception to the rule.  Otherwise, everything was delicious and perfect!  We will definitely be back again to enjoy the amazing food and drinks!  Debra was also amazing as well and should be complimented for her service.",

    "text": "LOVE Herbs & Rye!   It literally looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but the inside is spacious and very warm and cozy. It's pretty dimly lit and has an old Vegas feel to it. What's special about Herbs & Rye:  - They have a wide selection of specialty cocktails to choose from - The talented mixologists are also able to craft you a deliciously strong cocktail based on your preferences/likes  - Half of steaks during Happy Hour!!!! (Mon - Sat, 5P - 8P and late night HH from 12A - Close)  - Other food and drink specials during HH (definitely go for the steak though, what a deal!)  - Excellent service - both mixologists and servers  I had a birthday dinner here last year with a few girlfriends and had a phenomenal experience. I ordered a ribeye and it was a little more charred than my liking however still enjoyable. The sides were nicely seasoned and the portions were great for sharing!  Our server even brought out a small birthday dessert at the end our meal. It's always a nice personal touch when restaurants help celebrate special occasions.   I haven't been back in forever but I definitely will have to soon!",

Let me tell you, it's so tender and buttery it melts in your mouth like a piece of white chocolate on a summer day by the pool. The Mac and cheese, oh boy, the Mac and cheese is to die for. The cheese is complex and flavorful with an added bit of crispiness - like a recess pieces with a little bit of wafer added to it (oh you know what I'm talking about). The cocktails are also fabulous, I ordered a tequila mule and my girlfriend ordered a Diablo and we nearly had a mouthgasm at the amazing tastes and drunkenness our drinks brought us.

I ordered my steak medium rare and my wife ordered it medium well. Let me say it was delicious. 18 ounces of juicy flavor filled bites.   We also ordered the muscle app. It's a must get. The red sauce is incredible and makes a great companion to the bread.  We ordered two sides which are big enough to share. The asparagus and the mushrooms. The Asparagus well tasted like asparagus.

The food was pricey. Only a few items on Happy hour. The server  was nice and the manager had some comp appetizers for us to make up for it. The Rib-eye steak came out almost done and not medium rare like my bf requested. The waiter noticed the not touched leftover steak and the somewhat dried mac and cheese, he tried to bring another one. Same thing not upto par. The calamari, pizza, meatballs etc were not anything great. We only liked the drinks and the Linguine Pasta with clams.  Just the two of us who ordered happy hour items cost us $103!

    "text": "Ummm... Yum! Thanks to a recommendation by fellow Yelper (Micheal T.) we went to Herbs & Rye after our tour at the Neon Museum. I was so happy to be off the Strip. The recommendation was mostly for the cocktails, but when our server greeted us at 11:30pm and told us the food happy hour would start at midnight we couldn't resist!! All cuts of meat were half off! I got an amazing Filet Mignon with a side of truffle macaroni and cheese ($26 for the happy hour price; one side is included with your cut of meat). Grass-fed beef... yum!   The cocktail menu was very unique as a timeline of the cocktail. I opted for the Ramos Gin Fizz from the \"Golden Age.\" Delish! Adam on the other hand opted for Leap Year from \"Prohibition.\" I liked mine better. I wish I could've gotten a decent picture of the cocktails or the cocktail menu, but the ambiance is romantic and dark.  I highly recommend for visitors to venture away from the Strip and grab a late night steak and historical cocktail.",

I heard about this place so much from my friends, and I had to try it, especially after I heard about that happy hour. Half off steaks?! Stop. I'm sold! The ambience is relaxing. The inside is dark and small, making it for a nice and intimate atmosphere. This place also has an impressive cocktail menu, drinks under different themes. I went with the filet minion with the macaroni and cheese.. honestly one of the juiciest tastiest lil steaks I ever had.

We went during the soft opening with our friends and didn't have a great service experience. However, they appeared to be feeling out the space and staff. Recently we returned with friends from out of town. We ordered off the cocktail menu. Which is mostly filled with classic prohibition cocktails. Then after a few drinks we started to order the herbs and rye (bartenders choice). This led to three rounds of perfectly crafted cocktails each costing 8 dollars each. Better than any speakeasy ive ever been to. NY, SF, LA, NOIR bar. The mixology program here is wonderful and i cant wait to go back.  Also, the two appetizers (calamari and flatbread) were fantastic.  Beware so called mixology bars with central locations. This place has great drinks, good food, and stays open late.",

    "text": "UHHH!!! My stomach feels like it is going to explode. I am so full. I cannot eat another bite... but there is still half a dish of truffle mac'n'cheese. All are common responses when visiting Herbs & Rye.   I have been so bogged down with work, or work related situations that I was set on treating myself to a nice meal. I called up a friend and we met up for happy hour. Both of us didn't feel like drinking, so we opted for their food specials. The deals are limited to five or six items, but they offer some meals for half off. Instead of just filling up on quick fryer food, H&R includes a few steak and a pork chop entree. We began with the spicy mussels ($10 HH, $22 regular). The tomato sauce was so good that I was scooping it into empty shells to slurp down. For my entree I got the 12oz. bone in strip cooked to a medium rare with the peppercorn brandy sauce and the truffle mac ($17.50). I have to say this was near perfection. Yet, I would have been happier without the sauce. My friend had got the same steak with the chimiccuri and asparagus. I stole most of her sauce. I should have listened to our server, the chimicurri was much more flavorful and bold. Usually I am not a mac'n'cheese person. My gaze usually zooms over these words, but Robyn and Kevin L. swears by it. Luckily, I trusted them and ended up a winner.   By the end, two steak dinners with an large order of mussels to start cost us less than $50. Even though their HH list is minimal, Herbs & Rye's offerings are more than satisfactory.",

And that was where the service ceased to be good. Our waitress wasn't very attentive. Drinks that were ordered took 10 to 15 minutes to appear (but when they arrived they were VERY good). After we placed our food orders half of it came out after 45 minutes, and the other half came out 15 minutes later. The food was WAY overpriced for the quality (even accounting for the happy hour pricing). I'm told that the bar experience is MUCH different from the dining experience, so I might be back to check it out. As it stands I won't be returning for the food.",

Jalepeno creamed corn was good, but would be more spectacular if they used fresh cut corn.  Bf had ice in the spicy mussels which had great flavors in the sauce, but unfortunately one mussel still had ice on it!  Get the flat iron at HH price $13, you will not be dissapointed.  It is juicy and delicious.  It's definately a bargain.  Bf got the pork and fig....omg, SOOO amazing.  Not HH deal, but worth every penny.  We had 3 rounds of cocktails each, all were unique and kept us smiling the entire night!  Will come back again next time I'm in Vegas.",

The bar has potential as well as the food but when you mix expensive drinks with overpriced food and a wait staff that tries to get by on there looks with little or no concern for their guests you have chaos. We were lucky enough to go during Happy Hour. If not, our 2 entrees and 3 drinks each would have been $165 instead of $140! The steaks are priced like the Wynn as opposed to a dive on West Sahara! The drinks are $10 each or more...my wife's glass of reisling was $12 for 3 oz! The kicker...the server never thought to ask if they could buy us a shared dessert for our special day. I never thought about it til my wife mentioned it on the way home. Would I go back..sure if I can get someone to give me a loan for dinner!",

I talked with the bartender about what I liked about each and what else I'm drawn to in cocktails, and then asked him to take that info and create me something new.  It was the perfect drink...and unfortunately I have no recollection of what it was!  Job well done!  We also enjoyed some nibbles...a very nice flatbread...but thats all I remember.

    "text": "I have always heard about Herbs and Rye. From co workers and locals alike, so I ventured out for a first..  We arrived about midnight. As we entered it was dim and very relaxing. We were greeted by Joshua, a very welcoming young man, eager to give us a great experience. We started out with the Beef Carpaccio (w/ aoli, balsamic, caper berries, and wild rocket arugula). It had to be one of the best carpaccios I've had in a while. The dish presented tasted very fresh, and had a great presentation. The carpaccio was smooth and delicate. Not too \"beefy\". the other key factors was the aoli and balsamic, making this dish enjoyable as well as flavorful. The capers helped balance out the arugula. All in all it got our appetite ready for the main course, and most certainly our taste buds were amused.  My date and I had a \"Martinez\" cocktail to start. It complimented it well as it made us feel like we were in the 'Good Ol' Days' of Vegas once again. Our server recommended this for us, and we were glad he did so.  For our entree my date had the Kansas City steak (bone in) cooked medium. I had the ribeye (medium rare). For sides we both had garlic whipped mashed potatoes, the 'infamous' truffle mac n' cheese, and the garlicky spinach. When our entrees were delivered, once again presentation was extraordinary. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were mouthwatering. The garlic whipped mashed potatoes weren't as \"plain\" as you ordinary mashed potato dish. They had a subtle character to them. The truffle mac n' cheese was everything we had heard about and then some. Made the entire meal even more enjoyable. Then there was our garlicky spinach. it was nothing like we expected. The spinach was vibrant, full of life. Not mushy and 'can like'.  Would definitely recommend for tourists and locals. Will be here again soon.",

I always want to like shellfish, but especially clams and oysters, no matter how many times I order them, I just never do....until I had these. The porton is more than enough for 2 people, and it comes w/ awesome bread. For the entrees...I have never had pork that tasted better than their Pork chops and fig meal. It is incredible, when I tasted that, it was like when you have a child, I just, didnt know I could love something so much. They serve your standard drinks of course but also, a huge array of prohibition era drinks. Seriously, if you go anywhere else in Vegas to eat a steak, you are wasting your money and making a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor and wait til Midnight, when most items on the menu at Herbs & rye are 50% off!",

Salt is meant to enhance a dish's flavour; not dominate it.  The steaks are already generously rubbed with a house seasoning which renders any of the \"add-ons\" totally unnecessary. The apps are super salty, the sides are super salty, the steaks are salty.  So by the end of your 3 course meal your mouth is falling in on itself with pucker. We came during happy hour and unfortunately our medium rare steaks were overcooked. But they were still delicious, nonetheless. Service was attentive, the drinks were well balanced and delivered promptly. Even the hostess was really good at her job. My espresso (I am obsessed with the stuff): perfect. Creamy, rich, and had no burnt aftertaste as some espressos are wont to have. If you care at all about craft cocktails you MUST come here. I've never seen anything like it. (Bartender for 14 years)",

I've gone twice and had the same server both times, Ronnie. He was very patient with my demanding party. One of the ladies in our group wanted to customize a drink (when they already have a long list of super special specialty cocktails) and wanted A-1 for her filet. So anyways.   This last time we went, everything took a really long time. I'm not sure if it was our server's timing or if the kitchen was slow. Either way, I think it was a fluke because our first experience was fine.   I think a dinner here is in the $25-40 range.   We went during happy hour. During happy hour, it's -50% from well drinks and select items from the menu. My party of three each got a half-off entree.   Beginning with the cocktails. Their specialty cocktails are crafted with a history of alcohol in the US in mind. The cocktail menu is listed with era in mind (the Golden Years of Drinking, Prohibition, Reform, etc), with the liquors and garnishes relevant to the drink. Very nice. I got the Aviation, an herbal recipe of gin, creme de violette, and lemon. (By the way, I don't know how much the cocktails cost because someone else grabbed the tab both times I was there).   They have a full bar and also serve Le Grande absinthe.   The menu is American traditional and very small. I had the Fettucine Alfredo ($12, $6 during happy hour). It was pretty basic. Really nothing special. I also had a Caesar's salad with salmon ($11). Likewise, it was a basic dish. One thing that struck me, though, was the dressing had anchovy in it and it was like, the first thing that hit my palate. It was good (I love anchovies), just the right blend.   My mom got a nine ounce filet ($25, $12.50 happy hour) and my bf got the 17 ounce ribeye ($26, $13 happy hour). He ordered it rare and got a medium rare. All of the steaks come with a choice of two sides: Button Mushrooms, Jalapeno Cream Corn, Asparagus, Garlic Mash, Truffle Mac and Cheese, Crispy fries, Sweet Potato Tots. Might I recommend the tots? They are, how would you say, exquisite.   For dessert, we shared a caramel flan. It was a little different from other flans I've had. It was a little less custardy and almost cakey. Like cheesecake.  For the three entrees, a salad, a dessert, and six cocktails, the tab came out to about $100. Not bad.   The ladies bathroom is disproportionately large compared to the rest of the joint. Two stalls and kind of ill decorated.   But the restaurant is nicely done to continue the speak easy or Roaring 20's feel. The restaurant is partitioned in to two sections: the front and the bar. Next to the bar, there are about six semicircle booths facing the bar (and the flat screen tv's ... smart).   * off the strip, non-casino",

Especially the \"Blood & Sand\"  I had the Bistecca flat bread and Potato Gnocchii.. It was like I had stepped into the 1940's. Ohhhhhhhh Unbelievably fantastical idea, \"TMC\" Turner Movie Classic channel is channel chosen for motif. TOO COOL! I will come often. This place is the BOMB. The service was divine.

I work in the hospitality industry and understand the importance of my customer/clients and have previously referred family and friend to Herbs and Rye but ad the WORST customer service experience there recently!  Waitress(and hostess) were rude and self-occupied so much so that having THREE tables(and the the restaurant was virtually empty that night)was too much for the her.  She never asked us for drinks, we ordered steak and she never even asked how we wanted it cooked...perhaps her shallow little mind could read ours?!  It was ridiculous.  We walked out and called the manager/owner who was apologetic and groveling, asking us to give them another chance, took our number promising to call back but never did.  This is a manager/owner out of touch with his customers.  Prior to this experience, we have enjoyed this restaurant numerous times, but will simply take our business elsewhere where customer service is a priority.",

    "text": "I was definitely surprised when I walked into this restaurant.  From the exterior, Herbs and Rye looks like the kind of place where people go for line dancing; almost shed-like... But once inside, I noticed that this place was actually very nice. Black and Red walls with all black furniture and a door concealed as a book case make you feel like you're in a 1940's Italian mafia movie. Even better, is the service which makes you feel like you're practically family.  As for the food, I enjoyed it very much. The flat bread we got as an appetizer was so good that by the time my entree came, I was full.   The drinks selection, all from the age of prohibition, is also something I enjoyed. Most of the drinks were too strong for me but I appreciated the fact that all the juices/mixers were fresh, not to mention, it was nice to see something different.   On a last note, this place is great because it is off the strip (so you avoid the hassles of the crowds and the valet) but you still get on the strip quality...  I should probably add that I was brought here by a local (I'm from L.A.) named Jesse. So if the people from Herbs and Rye happen to read this, you can thank him for my review :)",

We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday of Fight Weekend not knowing what we're walking into with no reservations. Probably a fluke but we were seated right away. We spent more time on the drink menu because of all the amazing selection. I got a French 1275 and birthday girl got a tiki drink. Neither one of us were disappointed. She got the Mediterranean flatbread and I got the linguine and clam's and just like our drinks neither of us were disappointed. The linguine and clam sauce is on the spicy side so just beware. I wish I could remember our waiter's name but without me even asking to do a dessert for the birthday girl , he told me he was going to bring out to a sweet. Now that's customer service!! What we also appreciated was the fact the entire staff DIDNT sing. It was kept low key and a class act! We will definitely be back for more happy hours!!",

I got my well drink within 5 mins, Cab was poured, then put in front of friends seat..but on bartenders edge of counter?? (It wasn't till much later that I discovered the bartender started serving him white wine, and never gave him the red he charged me $16 for)! It took the bartender another 20 mins to even start making the specialty drinks?! I paid the $50 tab. Other friends (9 total..including me) showed up, so all moved to a table across from the bar. Then the nightmare really began. I made it very clear that my 2 sons and I were on the same tab. They ordered a couple more specialty drinks and I ordered an appetizer and Linguino n Clams (It was spaghetti noodles!) that was covered in shells, and even less clams, that were smaller than a 4 year olds fingernail. Very very bland. Most orders were placed just after midnight. I got my appetizer and Linguin(o) both about 40 mins later. No one else got their food yet. It took almost an hour before theirs started to trickle out. We kept reminding him of my sons 2 specialty drinks, but the waiter would regularly disappear for 15-25 mins! My sons ordered 2 sides of bacon mac n cheese and the waiter promised the drinks were finally being made, and that he will graciously comp them. 15 mins later the mac n cheese is served by someone else, and still no waiter, no drinks. Finally, one son had to leave as the drinks came. he took a sip and left. I paid what appeared to be a modest tab of 27 dollars. It turns out that was just the cost to the \"sides\" of mac n cheese! My other food was on someone else's tab! While sorting this out, another friend is given his tab without his credit card! We spend 20 mins looking for it under tables..everywhere (meanwhile waiter disappears again). WE asked the second bartender, and he said that he picked it up and held it thinking it was one of his customers! Our waiter finally reappears with my additional charges..takes friends card again and places it with billfolds in his apron pouch and promises not to lose it. He brings back my OTHER tab. You'll never guess what happens.. You did! He lost my friends card and tab AGAIN! Another 10 mins goes by before he returns with it! I then confront the bartender about $16 Cabernet that never made it to my friend, and he reruns my tab. The jury's out yet if these tabs ever show up correct on my Credit Card!  Herbs and Rye's prices are outrageous considering the dumpy location. Even Happy Hour prices are on the high side. Some of the foods and drinks were actually pretty good, but way over-priced. I've lived in Vegas for 23 years, and this was absolutely the worst customer service I've ever had..EVER!",

Finds out we're not from Vegas then shows up with a check time stamped by the register for 11:48pm as the time when we placed our order. I'm stunned that the \"owner\", Nicately, would pull something like this for an extra few bucks??? $22.00 dollars to be exact. I asked him about it and he said that was the time when we ordered. I told him we were in a taxi at that time...HA!! what a loser. Keep the money friend.",

What really made this place great other than the food and service was the drinks. This is only the second place in the last 2-3 years that actually new what a Moscow Mule drink was.

    "text": "I decided to take my girlfriend here for a nice dinner Upon arrival, I was skeptical based on the restaurant's outward appearance. However, we all know to never judge a book by it's cover.   We had 5:30 reservations and we arrived fashionably late at 5:45. It was 5:46 when we checked in with the host and she said that they can only hold reservations for 15 minutes, so we had to go back on the wait list. Initially I thought \"we are 16 minutes late.. can you cut us some slack?\" I wasn't upset though because she was right. No harm, no foul. Next time we will have to leave earlier. Regardless, we only waited about 2 minutes before being seated, which was great.   Service: our server was Jeremey. He was fantastic. He was well aware of us the entire time and most importantly, he kept our drinks full. Jeremey was polite and professional and he exemplifies the closest thing to a perfect server.   Atmosphere: bring your night vision goggles because this place is dark! In all seriousness, it's dim, calming, and pretty quiet. Ideal for a nice dinner or special occasion.   Food and Drinks: we took advantage of the happy hour specials, so we had wells mixed drinks, half off appetizer, and steaks. Everything was delicious.  Drinks - Me: Gin and Tonic - Girlfriend: Whiskey Coke   Appetizer: Spicy Mussels - These were heavenly. The joy you experience while eating these is comparable to the joy you felt as a kid on Christmas morning. We demolished the mussels and we couldn't stop eating the spicy red sauce that was left over. I highly recommend this.   Entree Me: 14oz New York Strip and Garlic Mashed Potatoes - The steak was amazing! I love New York strips because of how lean and tender they are. This steak was the leanest steak I've ever had (hardly any fat) and it was cooked to perfection. I also added the Herbs and Rye rub, which was solid.  - The garlic mashed potatoes were excellent. I enjoyed that they weren't overly complicated and rich.   Girlfriend: 14oz New York Strip and Truffle Mac and Cheese - she loved her steak! She also says that she enjoyed how lean, tender, and flavorful it was.  - Megan (girlfriend) fell in love with the Mac and cheese. I'm pretty sure she would have no issues leaving me for a bowl of this Mac and cheese. She said it was the best she had ever had, which means a lot considering she is a Mac and cheese fanatic that has tried them all.   Overall, we love Herbs and Rye and will certainly be back soon. If you have not tried this place yet, put it at the top of your list of places to try!",

A huge appetizer that should be shared by 2+ people. Calamari was good... nice different twist. Then we decided on soup bc we were getting full already. We got the tomato bisque  and French onion. Both were SOOOOO good. My hubby got the original Collins cocktail  and it was also very good! A nice gem off the strip!!!! A must try. Our server Tyler was great and the other wait staff was very accommodating",

After another person recommended it to me, I gave in and decided to go. The building dosen't look like much from the outside and is a lot smaller than expected when I walked inside. I chose to sit at the bar, which I thought might of been a huge mistake because of the drunk woman that sat next to me, but after she realized I wasn't interested in social hour with her, she departed.  The bartender was great and explained the entire dinner and drink menu thoroughly. So many interesting drinks. I'm usually just a beer or rum and coke guy, but I felt like trying something different. I ended up not caring for the drink too much and the bartender took notice. He made me something much better and I was happy. Now for the food! I ordered the 18 oz. rib eye steak, garlic spinach, asparagus and wiskey shallots potatoes. Not one thing was disappointing. Everything was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. It was plenty enough for me to take half of it home and have another meal the next day. I felt like I  needed a forklift to get out of the restaurant as I couldn't stop eating. The overall experience was outstanding and I'll definitely be going again. One of the best steaks I've ever had.",

    "text": "I'd dare say this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Service, ambiance, and amazing food are all on point. I've NEVER had a bad experience here. The steak is always cooked to perfection. My favorite side dishes are the truffle mac-n-cheese, and the jalapeno cream corn. If you can save room for dessert, the fresh made donuts are almost too good to turn down.  The bar staff is extremely knowledgeable, and can whip up anything to your taste.  Server Mark is always super helpful. I recommend that if you get a chance, make it in during happy hour  when all the steaks are half price. It gets crowded, so make a reservation!",

Their steaks are one of the best in town, and so very worth it during happy hour. Their sides are also great. Very rich and filling. Their appetizers are awesome. Honestly, I have yet to have anything I don't want to go back for.   Love the boozy, speakeasy vibe. My only gripes are the parking and music at night can be too loud.   Definitely worth trying if you have not already been.",

Our table ordered the donuts dessert. They were gone in seconds.   I loved the drink menu. Cocktails are separated by era on the menu. I had the bijou and it was really well done.  My only complaint was the darkness of the restaurant. It was hard to read the menu and see the food.",

    "text": "Worst happy hour ever (editing review for people to understand how this happened). Yes, the menu says groups are charged an auto gratuity (as is standard in the industry) but they INTENTIONALLY HID the auto gratuity (by literally SAYING they wouldn't charge us as a group - see below). Our server was AMAZING and deserves the tip (Deborah) but the anger comes from being INTENTIONALLY MISLEAD and TOLD we were being charged as individuals.   We had a group of 6 because someone showed up an hour after we had started. LITERALLY we had purchased drinks and our food and we're hanging out when a friend decided to join us. Our server said since we were 5 that we were originally rung up as individuals. However, management changed us to a \"group\" right before they rung us up and didn't even tell us. It took someone in our party who was actually critiquing her check to see it. If we were going to get the auto gratuity we wouldn't have even asked to split checks in the first place - what a waste and hassle if you're not being charged individually. Again, they rang us up as a \"group\" when they said they wouldn't!  That's why 1 star.   Specifically - we had people in the group who paid 22% to 33%. Seriously 33% percent.   There are too many restaurants in Vegas, with too many deals, to deal with this nonsense. As a local, I will never come here again",

I get the New York Strip with a bleu cheese crust. Oh. Em. Gee! I got the bleu cheese and bacon one time and found the bacon to be a bit much. I mean, they're BIG, THICK slices of bacon. I saved them for a BLT the next day   Mark is my favorite server. He knows when I say \"lots of garlicks\" on my garlic spinach, I mean LOTS *on* my garlic spinach. Other servers, bless their hearts, will either forget and bring me a side of cold garlicks or remember and put on, like 4.   Whichever way, the service is fantastic. I've never had a problem even when I'm in everyone's way, stalking the bar, waiting for someone to leave because I didn't make a reservation.    We usually go during happy hour because it's totally worth it for us because we love steak. There's no happy hour pricing for the cocktails, but the cocktail menu is practically a history lesson. It's especially great for people who like rum (I personally can't drink it), but they can substitute other liquors if you prefer. I did catch a side eye one time when I did, but the bartenders are artists, and I accept their judgment. I usually get a glass of sparkling wine because they serve it in those short, wide champagne glasses instead of the tall flutes. I don't know why this tickles me, but it does :)   My favorite, favorite place to eat right now. See you guys soon for my birthday!",

This is why Herbs & Rye should pretty much be my second residence.  Great quality meat at a killer price. Can't say anywhere else in Vegas (that I know of) is offering such a steal. I will say that their definition of well drinks on happy hour is ultra basic: think cranberry & vodka or rum & coke. One mixer, one liquor. They told me 'no' on a whiskey sour. Kinda odd, but who cares when the steak is what we're here for anyway?  The music was loud semi-retro hip hop with lots of Common and Kanye sprinkled throughout. No complaints there. Just be ready to talk over the jams while bobbing your head.  Oh, and get the donuts.",

We went during happy hour and all their main meats were 1/2 off! We had reservations for 5pm and we only had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. The server led us to a dim lit room that probably couldve fit about 50 people in there with some leg room. I also spotted a full bar before heading into the \"dining\" room. I chose the bruschetta and clams for our appetizer and the sweet potato tater tots covered in marshmallows as a side to my Filet mignon. EVERY DISH WAS SO AMAZING!!! the waitress also recommended specific cocktails to try and she was head on! I just told her that I liked tropical and sweet drinks and I loved both! I will definitely come again! The total at the end of the night came round to about 150 and i'd say that THAT is a good price for the great service, awesome food and even greater ambiance including the fun music they played!",

Happy hour is as legit as it comes. They do it so right I almost felt like I was getting away with something. 5-8pm with so many of my first picks as options including steak! They have the option of putting a spicy rub on your steak of choice. I was hoping for mine to have a good kick but it was modest. The flavor was on point, however.  We came for a birthday (party of 6) and everyone at the table shared family style so we could all taste the different flavors and get a good taste of the place. You just can't go wrong here and I say that after trying half the menu.  It was busy and the parking isn't thuper. It took way too long to get our drinks and to place our order. We were in good company, however, and nobody came hangry so it actually allowed for more time to enjoy the atmosphere.",

You can even tell the bartender what you usually drink, and they will fix you a concoction based on that, which was pretty darn impressive.  What I didn't love...The food. We just got appetizers, so perhaps the main courses are better, but the calamari was cold (and tasted old), and was smothered in a strange sauce. The sliders were better for sure, but nothing amazing.  However, I will be back for drinks, that is for certain! I'll just eat before I come.",

I can't remember the exact timing but I've never had an issue going and getting the happy hour pricing! The cocktail list is superb! They have so many fancy cocktails! The steaks are good, not amazing, but good. You definitely go for the ambiance and happy hour pricing.",

Its also definitely $$$ vs the $$ that it shows on Yelp (maybe even 4$).   ++ happy hour (4pm to 6pm, and midnight to 3am) makes it well worth it. steaks are half off.  ++ quality: truffle mac & cheese was rich & fantastic. flat iron steak was juicy and flavorful.   + cost: split a Caeser salad, and the two of us were out the door for $55 total.. stuffed and fully satisfied.  service was very friendly, albeit it a bit slow. but I didn't mind, we were seated in a table by the bar and it has a nice atmosphere.",

However, after you sit down, order a cocktail, and start digging into your meal - BAM!  This place is really good.  We had a big table and ordered a variety of plates including several steaks - we ate family style.  It was nice to be able to try a variety of the dishes.  The cocktails of course were very good.  Lots of interesting choices.  Our waitress was also very good - friendly, cute, and not afraid to offer suggestions.  They have a bar there too that looked like a cool place to hang out, but we didn't end up doing that this time - but we'll make a point if it next time.  One more thing - it's an excellent value.  I'll definitely be back.",

Its so romantic and the music is diverse, not too loud but noticeable. The bar is always packed 'cause of the amazing bartenders and the enormous list of cocktails. The service is just amazing.  There's Mark, the \"other\" Mark, Alley, and of Course the lovely Brittany just waiting to greet you at the door. And you won't believe it but the owner, can be found behind the bar on occasion. Just gotta mention the back up servers too. Always smiling and quick to get you whatever you desire C'mon check it out!",

They have half price steaks for happy hour ss well as a simple spirits menu. I wanted a dirty martini but there are no martinis on the happy hour menu. You're allowed one spirit and one mixer, so, I ordered vodka and a teaspoon of olive juice (dirty martini) but they won't shake it, lol. My only real issue with thus place is that they don't understand the definition of a reservation. We made reservations for 4 on both visits, always arrived on time, always waited a minimum of 20 minutes. Get your timing issue fixed, it's annoying.",

    "text": "When we moved to Vegas we made a list of all the steakhouses we wanted to try here...SO many to choose from. After reading reviews and looking at menus online our list narrowed. Herbs and Rye made the list though and we are so glad it did. We had dinner with friends here last night. When you drive up, it's just a average looking place. When you walk in from the Vegas sun, you feel like the place has no power...lol...it's so dark inside, it takes a minute for your eyes to adjust...then you finally see the hostess waiting at the end of the hallway to greet and seat you. We had made reservations because I had a feeling it would be busy on a Friday night, during Happy Hour where ALL steaks are 50% off!!!!! Yes you read it correctly!!! 5pm to 8pm ALL steaks are 50% off.  We were then seated at a great booth inside the bar...now if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner, don't let them seat you in the bar. We didn't mind sitting there. The energy was fun...it was loud like a bar that is hopping should be. We were the 1st to arrive and greeted by our waiters assistant...he got us nice cold water and we then met our waiter Ronald. He greeted us, asked us if we had ever been to Herbs and Rye and since we said it was our 1st time he went over the menu with us! We ordered cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive. The bar menu is amazing...a ton to choose from. We however like tiki drinks so we ordered painkillers.  They came quickly to us in these beautiful large tiki cups...1 drink had me tipsy...honestly after 1/4 of the drink I was feeling it. They were yummy.  The bar atmosphere and decor were great...very classic & old school.  Ronalds assistant was very attentive with our water needs...we needed it with the vegas heat..hydration is important! ;)  Our friends arrived and we finally were able to order! I ordered a filet mignon and had it was Bleu cheese crusted, the truffle Mac.n.cheese, and we shared a Cesar salad.  My man ordered the Ribeye and had the chimichuri seasoning, which is garlic olive oil and seasonings added and asparagus. We shared the sides. We also shared a side of garlic mashed with our friend. Our friend ordered the pork chop and our other friend ordered the filet flat bread with arugula.  When the food arrived, steaks were on their own plates and the sides were served in individual little casserole dishes, so very easy to share.  I have to say...it was one of the BEST filets I have had, juicy and tender and taking a bite of the man's Ribeye it was the BEST Ribeye I had ever tasted. The flavor was amazing.  The asparagus was cooked to perfection with butter and lemon. The mac.n.cheese was creamy and had a crust on the top that was crunchy. The mashed potatoes I didn't try but my man said it was really good. Our Cesar salad we had earlier was delicious as well. The dressing was garlicky and peppery! We were also served hot bread and butter that was delicious!! But honestly the BEST part of the entire experience was the attention from our waiter. Customer service is a HUGE part for me...and this was spot on!!! Thank you for not only an amazing meal but a wonderful experience!!!  We will 110% be going back!!",

I enjoyed a thick, perfectly cooked, New York steak w/garlic mash, and two cocktails; a Painkiller and Missionaries downfall. Which were extremely delicious!!! My boyfriend ordered the little neck clams to start, and couldn't stop licking his fingers. Haha. He ordered the flat iron steak with blue cheese topping and asparagus. His plate was completely clean by the end of our meal. He enjoyed his dinner with a Blood & Sand cocktail and said it was strong and very tasteful. Our dinner came out to be $101.34 w/out tip. I believe all the steak dinners come with one side. Alycia, who was our server was polite and attentive to our needs. The ambiance was warm and romantic. It also wasn't too busy on the Wednesday when we arrived. But as we finished our dinner and were leaving, I noticed the place getting busier with the majority of the tables and bar seats being filled.  I highly recommend this place for creative drinks and tasty food.",

    "text": "BEST STEAKS in LAS VEGAS. PERIOD  Forget shelling out $80 - $100 for a rib eye at a fancy steak house on the strip, for you steak lovers out there, this is the place to be.  The place can get a little bit hectic at times, and service is a hit or miss but it's their happy hour that makes up for it all. Trust me, every other time I'm in that place, you won't see their servers for a while because their running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I ain't gonna lie, it makes me mad in the beginning waiting for our food and drinks but once you take a bite of their steaks you just zone the hell out and forget everything bad that just happened.  Yeah it's that good, I work in the hospitality industry too and service is one of the things I look for while dining out at other places.   Happy Hour is 5pm - 8pm and 12am - 3am everyday with the exception of Sundays (closed)  50% off all steaks, and a few apps.  Weapon of Choice: 14 oz NY strip, medium rare, with a side of peruvian chimichurri and creamed corn. This ain't your graveyard casino $3.99 steak and eggs NY strip, I honestly don't know how they get the NY strip so damn tender. It eats like a Rib Eye but with less the fat.   All in all, for about $21 for a steak, side, and topper, you cannot go wrong with that.  I will be in here frequently, say hi if you ever run into me =]",

    "text": "I've got good news and bad news. Let's start with the bad news first. My fiance and friends were out for a nice evening and decided to go to herbs & rye for dinner. I ordered a steak and my fiance ordered the linguine clams pasta that is on the happy hour menu. A few hours after we got home my fiance started to feel nauseous and shooting pains in her stomach. Yup you guessed it she got food poisoning. Yes, this happens from time to time as I've worked in the food and beverage industry before. I called Herbs and Rye to let them know the situation and was greeted by Christian who sounded scared to call himself the \"manager.\" I told him what had happened and he had the audacity to tell me that food poisoning usually happens 24 to 48 hours after consumption. Basically, he called me a liar. First of all I am a local and have been to the restaurant quite a bit. Second of all, I've gotten food poisoning before and and it only took a few hours to kick in. I told Christian to check his facts. Not one time did he apologize or take any action to rectify the situation. I left my number down hoping they would call me back, but since I am writing this post I bet you can already guess they didn't. That was a shocker as \"management\" was fully aware of the situation at hand. With all the talk about Chipotle and all the sickness going around I'm so surprised that I didn't receive a call back. My advice is to handle your customers as if they are your family or that it is you who experienced the problem. Herbs and Rye was a great place to go to in the past, but as time goes on their happy hour continues to get worse, and the action of management has extremely disappointed me.   The good news = waiter and hostess were very nice.",

    "text": "I always enjoy myself at Herbs & Rye, the happy hour is packed and full of vibrant energy! Drinks are unique and you can really feel the bartenders love their jobs and know their stuff. Love the ambience here and speakeasy vibe. This little gem for locals and tourists alike is just want we need off the strip and not downtown. I recently came for a Monday dinner and it was absolutely delicious. We were told there was a wait for a booth of 45mins even though the booths were pretty much empty and we had just missed happy hour so it had cleared out pretty quickly. We decided to wait at the bar and have a glass of wine, maybe about 10 minutes later, our booth was ready so do not be afraid to be put on the waitlist. Waitress was super attentive even though she had a few tables already, she brought us out the bread. The portion for their bread is much to be desired, it was a little loaf, kind of looked like it was for one person. For appetizers, we decided on the flatbread pizza and truffle Mac & cheese, I don't remember what kind of flatbread it was called but it had cherry tomatoes that melted in your mouth and capers. Omg it was soooo good! We were pretty full just after that and our wine. Our main entrees arrived promptly afterward, I had the Penne which I believe was Penne Alla Carbonara and it was to die! My boyfriend had the angel hair pasta, it was all very tasty. Every bite was rich with flavors and our server tended to us just enough to let us know she was there but not overdoing it so we had plenty of space and alone time while we ate. All in all, very pleased with the food selection at Herbs & Rye! Will be back for happy hour steaks because those prices look to be a steal for the quality you are getting here. You cannot go wrong here, if it's happy hour drinks at the bar, or sitting down for a nice dinner with your man/woman. P. S. Music that night was Motown jams, also a plus.",

Even though the place was packed I was able to snag two seats at the bar pretty quickly. The drinks were great.  I had a Moscow Mule and some other specialty drink that I don't quite remember the name of.  For dinner we had salads which were both delicious. The bread was really good too. Happy hour specials were good but the food is a little on the high end so prepare to spend about $30 on a steak even if it's half off during happy hour.  The portion sizes are large but I'd like to see some smaller portions at more reasonable prices. The staff was entertaining and accomodating. The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the entree costs. If you're looking for a dark,  loud,  trendy spot with lots of action this is it.  If you want something quaint and quiet go elsewhere.",

The prohibition like ambiance is kind of cool and you feel part of a boardwalk empire episode. You expect James Gandolphini or Joe Pesci showing up at any time.   If you are budget conscious you'd better ask for the price of he cocktails before you order. We only took appetizers and no entrees but the cocktails were half of the bill and it wasted our entire experience.   The food was ok and the bread was really dry and old.   Disappointed.",

    "text": "I had wanted to sample the fare at Herbs & Rye for some time, based on the recommendations of Yelp Friends.  Finally, the moment came, and Diane and I passed through the darkened entrance.  We were there for the food--not the creative drinks--and looked forward to a sumptuous dinner.    First to be set before us by our friendly server Eddie A was delicious fresh-baked French bread and soft butter.  This was quickly followed by a lovely-looking Shrimp Cocktail featuring six medium-sized red-tailed and white-topped shrimps curled over the serving plate.  The cold crustaceans tasted very good after being dipped in the zesty traditional Cocktail Sauce that accompanied them.  Next was a novel surprise: an Iceberg Wedge that, instead of being crafted in the shape of a wedge as expected, was about two-thirds of a head of Iceberg Lettuce that had been sliced straight through the top to resemble a high mesa somewhere in the Southwest.  Festooned on the flat leafy surface were slices of tomato, red onion, bacon, Bleu Cheese crumbles, croutons, and a rich and ample supply of Bleu Cheese Dressing.  This was an excellent, crunchy salad course.   Produced after this were my 9 oz. Filet Mignon with Brandy Cream Sauce & Peppercorns, and Diane's 12 oz. Ribeye Steak.  My entree was largely medium-rare as ordered, but a few parts of it were slightly undercooked.  Diane's Ribeye, on the other hand, was overcooked--more medium-well than medium-rare as she prefers.  When asked if her steak was cooked as she had specified, she admitted that it was more done than desired, but said that it was okay and she would eat it.  \"No,\" said our server.  \"We'll prepare you another one, and take it off the bill.  We want you to come back.\"  My wife politely declined the gracious offer, and slowly picked at her steak and sides until not too long afterward when suddenly a steaming plate was placed before her, with a new, obviously medium-rare and glistening 12 oz. Ribeye mounted on it.  The kitchen had quietly prepared a new steak anyway.  She accepted the promising substitution, and her old steak was immediately removed.  This fresh and juicy steak she really enjoyed, accompanied by a luscious Macaroni & Cheese side with bacon added.  I sampled the Mac & Cheese, and the hot white cheesy sauce really was delectable, just as was the Brandy Cream Sauce that covered my Filet and provided a liquid base for it.  We had other sides to indulge in as well.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms were hot and meaty, and I opted for the deluxe version of Sweet Potato Tots with Honey & Marshmallow Crust.  Large marshmallows were nicely melted over tater-tot-shaped knobs of sweet potato that had been sweetened further with honey.    While we were eating our meals, mob movies were playing without commercial breaks on a large flat-screen TV mounted behind the bar and facing our booth.  It was actually quite enjoyable to have that as a backdrop, and we became engaged in following the action.  The final delight of the night was the gigantic, warm, and freshly baked Chocolate Chip Cookie a la mode that was presented with long trails of Chocolate Sauce drizzled across the massive cookie and streaming down the two large scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream that rested on top and stood like silent sentinels.  It was a great dessert, and a sweet way to end our leisurely stay.  P.S.  True to our server's word, when the bill arrived, besides a 50% price reduction off the cost of my Filet for dining during the extended Happy Hour, no Ribeye Steak appeared on the tab.  It was an unnecessary but generous and classy gesture.  So, I reciprocated by leaving a substantial tip.  And, I am sure that we will come back.",

Pricey drinks. Atmosphere was extremely dark but cozy.  Do not sit at a booth around the bar!  With happy hour getting a bit busy, you're sure to have your table getting bumped into several times and spend your night reading the back of several shirts.  But I got really lucky and got to see some chica's ass as she climbed up a bar stool like she was Stallone in Cliffhanger allowing her short skirt to ride up lol.  The steaks were great, ordered the ribeye with a blue cheese crown, and the filet.  Each come with a side to which we got the mashed potatoes, and jalapeno corn, also added the truffle mac (you know).  All the sides were a lil.... Eh.  Mashed:  we're they suppose to be garlic mashed cuz they almost had no garlic in em... Corn wasn't creamy enough and truffle Mac was bland n dry. Sides need work.  Oh but the calamari was on point! Great flavors on that dish.  Finished off with the donuts and hey, how can you go wrong with donuts.  I'd go back for sure but only during the happy hours.  The Moscow mule is already calling my name again.",

    "text": "Two stars means \"I've experienced better\". And in this case, I have experienced FAR better than this place. Came with a group of about 15. Did not get bread until the food was served. The server came only to take the orders. No explanation or recommendation of ANY kind. The non-Happy-Hour prices are far above than regular prices at other steakhouses. That might be somewhat palatable if there were comparable stellar service to go with. The whole dining experience is not just about the food. It takes into account the experience from the moment you step inside to the moment you step out of the restaurant. This place sorely lacked in making this a positively-memorable experience. It did succeed in leaving us with a bad taste in the mouth (metaphorically speaking). Perhaps they are not too enthusiastic about having large groups come and dine. We knew ahead of time that they would not make separate checks. But trying to figure out everyone's share was like deciphering a code. The bills lists the regular price, the Happy hour price and a total of what we \"saved\" because of Happy hour.   The 20% automatic gratuity was a real killer. The service did not deserve any kind of gratuity. Upon discussing with one of the employees, his comment was \"this is company policy, we just work here\". REALLY!!! Perhaps someone should explain to him what \"service\" in customer service means!! He stated the gratuity policy is in the menu. I guess it must be in some fine print because it did not catch my eye when I was looking over the menu for ordering.   BOTTOM LINE: T-Bone at Redrock, Fleming's, Del Friscos, Echo and Rig, Alder and Birch have far better service and food for less than H&R's regular prices. I am not planning on coming there any time soon!",

    "text": "OVERCHARGED AND IGNORED!  My girlfriend and I went here for a late dinner about 2 weeks ago.  Nondescript exterior, pretty cool red lounge-y interior.  But, friends, the buck basically stops there.    Immediately we were greeted by a rank bathroom sewage smell that creeped out of ladies restroom.  That odor persisted throughout our entire meal.  For drinks, we ordered the house brew: really boring beverage; at least it was well priced.  We were starving and ended making a pretty eclectic food order: calamari, mediterranean flatbread, chop salad, pork and figs.  Everything was okay; super rich, a wee salty, but pretty good.  Here's the point of my story: our bill came to $82, we left $16 for the tip and went on our way, glad to be smelling fresh air.  When the bill finally posted, we had been charged $36 for the tip!  I called 5 times, friendly each time, trying to get this rectified.  Each time I was promised a call back.  Not once did anyone call.  I even spoke to the GM/Owner, Nick, who told me he'd take care of it right away and to call back if I didn't see a credit in 24 hours.  The last time I called I was put on hold for a full 4 minutes and hung up.  I called right back; the line was inexplicably busy for the next 20 minutes.  I had to resolve the overcharge directly through the claims department at my bank.  Had they shown any real intention to fix their error and followed through with even a single call I expect we'd go back: ordering better beer and lighter fare, yes, and turning around at the door if it still stank.  Okay.  BUT! to be disregarded entirely despite making my best and patient effort repeatedly leaves me with a foul taste, odor AND impression.  Not Going Back.",

    "text": "Okay so it's been a long azz time since I wrote a review.  This place made such an impression on me that I just had to get back on here and share.  Damn it's been over a year!  This place has that old school speakeasy vibe that I've been looking for (don't let the outside of this joint fool you).....   -dark lighting to set the mysterious and chill vibe right. CHECK  -simple, classic styled furniture and decor as if you walked right back into the past.  CHECK  -leather booth seating.  CHECK  -small, quaint, and not a manufactured corporate chain.  CHECK  -friendly service that knows their menu inside and out.  CHECK  -damn simply,  a classic, cocktail lounge with character!  There's two sides to this joint, the restaurant side and the bar side.  Pick the side based on your purpose for being there.  Duh, I was here to drink....so straight to the bar I went.  The bar is the perfect place to chat it up with the bartender and ask questions about the drink menu if it's your first time here.  Mike (our bartender for the night) was very friendly and explained the menu very well.  School was in session.  Great service overall.  I cannot speak for the food since I came here purposely to drink and chill.  But from what I saw and smelled everything looked great.  Some random girl next to me ordered the donuts.  They looked so damn good I was gonna chat her up and see if she was willing to share!  She was a cutie, but it was the donuts I really wanted.  Hahaha.  Anyway, back to the real reason for this review....the DRINKS!  I cannot explain well enough how awesome these drinks were.  These drinks are handcrafted, classic drinks representing different eras of American drinking.    Wait, did I tell you they were handcrafted?  Yes, handcrafted!  Hold up.....let me change that....these weren't just any drinks...these were cocktails.  And the cocktails weren't just poured....these were handcrafted.   Dammit......these were Handcrafted Cocktails!  No pre-made mixers or store bought juices used at all.  Cocktails shaken by hand over one shoulder.  Fresh cut fruits for the juice or zest only.  And a little bit of fire for the Blood and Sand cocktail.  Watch out now!  Very entertaining to watch these bartenders make your drink.  I listed below the eras the different cocktail menu items represented:  Gothic Age of American Drinking (?-1865)  Golden Age of American Drinking (1865-1900)  Old School Age of American Bartending (1900-1919) . Prohibition(1920-1933)  Years of Reform (1934-1948)  Dark Age of American Drinking(1949-1989)  The Revival of the American Drinking(1990-Present)  Side Story: I came here on a recommendation a couple of bartenders (Kevyn and Jonas) from the Social House (yes I was drinking there earlier that day too) made to me when I had asked if they knew of any place in Vegas that was a chill, low key place that was unique.  They had asked in return if I was looking for something on the Strip or off the Strip.  I mentioned that I've done the stereotypical Vegas scene plenty of times already.  They told me specifically to check out Herbs and Rye.  And I'm glad I did!  My buddy and I tried a few drinks that were recommended to us by the bartenders from Social House:  Aviation, Blood and Sand, and Vieux Carre.    When my buddy asked what was another good cocktail from the menu, Mike our bartender of course replied \"everything\", and then continued to handcraft a cocktail called Corpse Reviver No. 2 for him.  Man, they were all good!  Next time, I'd probably start with the Vieux Carre for the full, bold taste and end with the Corpse Reviver No. 2 which is more sweet and refreshing.  The Aviation and the Blood and Sand were somewhere in between.    I highly recommend all these cocktails.  SIde Notes:  -We came here for late night happy hour 12AM-3AM and only spent $9 a cocktail.  There's no way on the Strip we would've gotten strong quality handcrafted cocktails like these for $9 each!   Tell me if you do.  -It was Late Friday Night/Early Saturday Morning when we rolled in and they were spinning old school Hip Hop!  -It wasn't packed in here at this time and the clientele seemed more like locals then tourists.   Okay yeah I get it, people come out to Vegas from all over to party up on the Strip....  dress up all fancy, throw cash around like you're dirt rich, drink expensive drinks, etc.  After awhile isn't always the same?  If you wanna check out something different check out Herbs and Rye.  At the very least start your partying here for the earlier happy hour...then head out to the Strip.  If you're already partying on the Strip, you'd probably wouldn't physically be able to make out here for the late happy hour (yeah I know you party hard).  In case you do, it's the perfect place to unwind and chill for a couple more cocktails before going to bed.   So what if  I left this place about 3:30AM and feeling really good and ready to continue partying....don't judge me!    Definitely coming back when I'm in town",

And, honestly, I always have the most fun and best conversations with the people who frequent the place.  I love, love, love handcrafted cocktails.  Herbs and Rye has this nifty drink menu that goes back in time and tells you a little bit about the history of each \"drinking era.\"  I have been able to try so many different cocktails and been introduced to drinks I had never heard of before.  My favorites: Bees Knees (refreshing and citrusy), Blood and Sand (careful, it involves fire!), Sazarac (puts hair on your chest), Ward 8 (can't think of a description!  Lame, I know!).  I hear all sorts of buzz about the happy hour and the food, but I've never eaten here, so I can't comment on that.  Truth be told, I always end up at the Ricos Tacos in the parking lot outside of Herbs and Rye!  But I should really try the food here if it's as quality as their drinks!  Thumbs up.",

Nothing exemplifies the Vegas bar experience more than a huge 10,000 square foot room with a rectangle bar in the middle of it with Cruddy bartenders pouring overpriced drinks.  This place is more out of Chicago or San Francisco than Las Vegas.  It's got a pretty dark old school vibe that I really like.  The bartender was happy to make suggestions for drinks, since we generally aren't gin/rye drinkers in my party.  Every drink we had was off the menu, no well drinks on this night.  They were all outstanding.  Didn't get a chance to try the food, but if it's as good as the vibe and the drinks it's got to be great.    Looking forward to my next trip to try the food and more of the drinks.    Short story, if you're into cool bars and despise the Designer/Summerlin Bar scene, this place is awesome.",

She answered very rudely and says \"all of our steaks doesnt come bone-in, only thing that is none-in is pork chops\" isnt that why I was asking, it's my 1st time and I wanted to know. Steak didnt impress me much, pretty dry and tasted like one of those frozen ones. But for a happy hour price it's worth it.",

The truffle mac & cheese and mushroom sides were tasty as well!   The restaurant is very unsuspecting on the outside, but the interior has a speakeasy, Prohibition era feel.

I definitely recommend this as well!! I made my reservations for 6 and they called day of to confirm and ask if we were celebrating anything. My friends had just gotten married so I let Kimberly know. She was so sweet and excited for us to celebrate there!!   First thing: parking is awful. Tiny parking lot and at dinner time, it was full (and then some). Checked in with the hostess and a few minutes later we were seated. I was surprised at how spacious the dining areas are...it didn't look that big from the outside. But even with all the space, the entire place was PACKED. We were seated by the bar in the back corner.   The food... oh goodness! The food!! So tasty!! I ordered a filet (medium rare with the blue cheese topping) and truffle Mac & Cheese. That Mac & Cheese was amazing. For me, I couldn't finish it, but I really wanted to! The steak was perfectly done and the blue cheese crumble was a great added touch. Others in the group got ribeye, mussels, whiskey potatoes... everything was amazing.   To celebrate the wedding, our server brought out some of their delicious donuts. SO TASTY!   I will certainly be returning. I had a great experience and the food was amazing. I would warn that it is LOUD as well as pretty dark, so keep those things in mind.",

I have been here a few times and every time has been great. The atmosphere is business casual but you can dress up or down from that without it being an issue.   Let me get this out of the way, two of the five best steaks I have had in the last five years have come from this place. This is a place any steak fan visiting or living in Las Vegas must come visit. You get very high quality steaks, sides and drinks here. I have tasted a couple of different cuts but I say go with the Ribeye.  The drink menu is really fun, it categorizes drinks by era. You can still get a Budweiser if you want, but seriously, DON'T. The drinks are well described and crafted with the level of care you can expect from any retro speak easy.  The service has also been great every time I have gone. The last two times I went with my fiance we had Mark helping us and he is awesome.  Go here, it is worth it. One last hint, get the donuts for dessert.",

Me and my friends went here for happy hour and showed up about an hour before our reservation to get some cocktails at the bar. The cocktail list has groupings of cocktails from every decade starting I think around the 20s. It is super interesting and they have a ton of really delicious cocktails including many gin options which isnt common anymore. I loved The gin fizz the most. It was a work of art! And it is so fun to watch the bartenders create these amazing drinks.  For happy hour you get half of states and I think drinks. Making mistakes around 20 something dollars which is very reasonable considering the quality of the state! You can add things onto it I added mushrooms and onions. Also you can get side separately. I ordered the truffle mac & cheese which was divine! I would go to herbs and Rye just for that mac & cheese!   I had such a great experience here that I am planning to go for my birthday with about 15 friends! When I called to make a reservation the girl that I talk to was super accommodating and seemed very excited to have us! You definitely do need to make a reservation way in advance because they do book up.   I might update with at least photos for my birthday party!",

The happy hour special for steak is still well worth it despite having to sacrifice the service. The red wine glaze is the bomb!!

We decided to go early and sit in the bar at 6:00 and put our name on the walk in list. We grabbed a drink at the bar and enjoyed the atmosphere. The bartenders were busting their A$$es and wow so friendly and so much fun to watch, the music was prohibition /New Orleans type. It was great! 45 minutes later we were seated. Our waitress was so cool and so patient and gave us recommendations.  After literally drooling over the menu which was so hard to make a decision  we did it! Husband had linguine and clams, I had pork and figs. Both were amazing! We complimented our dinner with an old fashioned and a sazerac. our waitress even brought us champagne to celebrate our anniversary! Excellent food, excellent atmosphere and excellent service. My only complaint is that during dinner the music changed from New Orleans/prohibition jazzy to disco/clubish music. Please keep the music prohibition/jazzy/New Orleans!!! Or save the disco stuff for after 10!  Absolutely loved this place. Without having to travel to the strip made it our favorite place!! We will be back!!",

I love a good cocktail to end the night and relax, but this place was packed, loud and not an available seat in the house. I figured it be might more chill on Thursday night at 12:30am, but nope.   We finally were able to sit down and were greeted by a server who had excellent knowledge of the drink menu. I chose from the \"Years of Reform\" menu, specifically the \"Lion's Tail\". This is a Rye Whiskey based drink with bitters, lime, bar syrup, and Allspice Dram. It was a very good cocktail with great flavors and nothing too overpowering. I could have had another, but the first drink took so long I didn't want to wait for another.  We also ordered some fried calamari to snack-on while we hung out. This was a pretty basic plate of fried calamari, but you get almost an entire ocean's worth of fried salty morsels. This is a great option for sharing with friends, but the no mind blowing flavors here.   I do love the prohibition look of this place and the dimly lit secret agent vibe, but I was wanting more. The bartender's seemed to be behind with a large party taking up most of the restaurant's service.   I believe in second chances. Herbs and Rye I'll see you again soon!",

I had the New York strip. It was only $21 with the discount! Everyone else had the ribeye. Both were amazing. If I had to choose one, I would go with the ribeye. It's only $29 with the half-off discount and it's around 18 ounces (no bone) if I remember correctly.   A steak order comes with your choice of one side order. They have several to choose from including mashed potatoes, steak fries, truffle mac-n-cheese, button mushrooms to name a few. They also serve a ton of unique drinks. Some date back to the prohibition days.   Service is great and our server was very knowledgeable about all the food and the drinks. The ambiance of the restaurant is also pretty cool. They have a lot of cool fixtures on the walls and old news articles dating back many years. I highly recommend for steak lovers!",

    "text": "Late Review. Coming to Vegas you definitely want to try a good steak house. After days of eating nothing but pho,Korean bbq,banh mi and viet food I definitely needed a good steak. So my brother who has been a resident of Vegas for a decade recommended this place. They have happy hours with crazy hours which is very common catering to a city that never sleeps. So we definitely wanted to give it a shot. Anything with the red dot is half price on their menu including all steaks so I was pretty excited. We started off with the carpaccio which is my all time fave. Presentation was nice and was pretty good certainly not the best carpaccio I've had but definitely not the worst. Also did the spicy mussels which was kind of disappointing some of the mussels were still cold and had chips of ice in them so that dish was a failure and the tomato sauce in the dish was kind of too pasty it says cooked in white wine don't think we had any in ours becuz the sauce was too thick. For dinner I had the 18oz ribeye I asked for black and blue since I love my steaks rare as possible.. the steak was seared definitely not black and blue more like iron panned flat and that was it. So I didn't get the charred crust from the seasoning that ur suppose to get and taste. The sides we got were the jalepeno cream corn which was probably the best thing we ate at their and the truffle Mac n cheese was good as well... oh if you do venture here if you have more than 2 people in a party they won't allow you to have separate bills they put  it all together and you and your party have separate and decides who pays for what yourselves... we had a party of 8 that day and it took our waiter 45 mins just to get the bill taken care of.. hella inconvenient !! All in all not something we are dying to go back to!",

Turn back the clock. The rat pack is whispering through the walls. Dark ambiance, cool music, classic cocktails and out of this world menu for steak lovers. Our waiter Mike was so friendly and informative. He guided us through the menus, helped us with our cocktail selections and wine selection. We had New York Strip and Filet Mignon with sides of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes. Mike was constantly on top of our dining experience and we never waited long for any assistance. Wonderful experience and we will be back and let all our friends know about this great local draw.",

We arrived at 7:05pm but circled the parking lot twice and thought maybe we should eat elsewhere.  However, after 15 minutes of circling Chinatown, we decided to try Herbs and Rye once more.  Found a parking spot - at this point it was 7:25pm.  Walked in with a sleuth of people waiting looking very anxious.  Approached Brittney at the podium and was immediately attacked in a loud tone that we were late and can't hold tables more than 30 minutes.  I explained to her that our reservation changed to 7:30pm.  Showed her the email and Brittney's response was \"well no one told me!\"  My husband and I were shocked to have been spoken to in that matter in front of a line of customers.  The waiting area is very small and narrow that the waiting customers can't help but hear the conversation. Brittney says we'll need to wait 30 minutes since she was never informed.  Not even a apology.  We walked out as  I refuse to be ridiculed and belittled by a 21 year old who has no clue when it comes to service.  Treating customers as if we should be honored that she's holding the golden key into dining with Herbs & Rye.  We drove from the Southwest side because of the raving reviews and recommendations of this restaurant.  No thank you.   Not wasting our hard money for tactless experience.  We opted for dinner on the Strip.  Pricier - but a better and classier dining experience.   It's unfortunate that Britney is Herb & Rye's front face and first point of contact.  Suggestion: send her to customer service and etiquette training.",

I guess the big attraction is half off steaks.  So you spend $30 instead of $60.  Big deal.  The items I like are not on happy hour.  The shrimp cocktail, the mac N cheese, crab cakes(I think they took them off) the wings, etc. I got the fried calamari once and it was so hard and dry I sent it back for a salad. And the martini's are not on special either.  So, it's worth a visit to check it out, but I didn't think it was great!",

Their \"happy hour\" menu is carefully deceptive, thread thru it carefully least you be \"Tricked\"  Last night we had dinner and drinks @ Herbs & Rye our first visit  We were attracted to the supposed \"happy hour\" half price on drinks and dinners.  We told our waiter Jeremy that we were there for the first time and were told that only well drinks were included in the 2 for 1 so we ordered two bloody Mary's turns out that even though they were \"well\" drinks, they were considered \"Specialty Cocktails\" @ $13.00 a piece.  And dont order a condiment, creamy Horse Radish with your steak will set you back an additional $3.75.   The meal itself was average with a well done steak being dry, instead of the moistness of finer restaurants. The salmon, although tasty was in a sauce that was way too salty, especially since we requested no salt or little salt.   They rely on a theme of a speakeasy to draw but if youre interested in a really good dinner at a \"bargain\" look not here, dinner drinks  1 dessert and expresso's for 2 set me back $150.00 plus tip.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a quality steak dinner, definitely come during Happy Hour 5 PM-8 PM and 12 AM - 3AM (50% all steaks and certain entrees and appetizers!). Although my wallet was sad afterwards, I do not regret eating the delicious 14 oz NY Strip steak and truffle mac and cheese, unnffff.   The exterior of the place makes it look like some shady strip club or something because there were no windows just some doors. When we walked in I felt like I was in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland cuz it was so dark. Nonetheless, never judge a book by it's cover! The atmosphere was great and the waiters and waitresses were extra friendly.   As for the quality of food, I'd say it has been spot on. The first time I went here was last year when I was craving Linguine and clams at 2AM and thankfully this place was open (you have no idea how much I love linguine and clams). It was a to-go order and service was fast. The linguine and clams wasn't the best I ever had, but! Being hormonal at 2AM, it was pretty damn good. & they used real clams, not that salty canned crap.  My most recent visit on the 08-24-15 was even better because I had a chance to actually sit down and enjoy everything right there. We started off with some appetizers of Spicy Mussels. It was a good amount of mussels drenched in marinara/tomato sauce and came with 2 loafs of bread. It was a comfortable level of spice and the fact that it was 1/2 off made it more merrier.   I ordered the 14 oz NY Strip Steak medium rare and it included my choice of one side so of course when I see something like Truffle Mac n Cheese, hell freaking yeah I'm choosing that! Again, service was pretty quick. My steak was cooked perfectly. It was literally the most beautiful thing I had seen in days haha. I was a little disappointed in the Truffle Mac n Cheese though. It was good but not great :/ I felt like it wasn't cheesey enough or something. Idk it just needed a little extra something! It's my fault, I hyped myself up for Mac n Cheese all day that day.   Overall I've had a great experience here. Waiters were on top of their water-refill game. I'd take like a small sip and it's like their water-refill senses shit was tingling or something cuz 5 seconds later they'd be over my shoulder refilling my cup haha. Definitely would recommend this place for a nice night out :)",

    "text": "Suggested to us by a bartender at the awesome Banger Brewery, we were so glad we had our last dinner out this awesome, unique off-strip restaurant. While unassuming outside, from the moment we walked in I felt like I'd been transported to a 1920's speakeasy. The red velvet wallpaper, the black leather seats, and the chain chandeliers set a fantastic mood.  Allie, our server, was very knowledgeable about the extensive cocktail menu and had great suggestions for us. She was fun and friendly through our long meal and I feel lucky we had her as a server. She was the proverbial cherry on top of our delicious meal.   The biggest draw for Herbs & Rye is their half-price steak happy hour and I see why. You receive your steak and one side at a very reasonable price point. My fiance got his first filet mignon ever with no sauce (because why cover up a great steak) and I ordered the NY strip with the brandy peppercorn sauce. The meat on both cuts was extremely tender; the filet was melt-in-your-mouth soft. Both had a great crust on them with a nice, rare center. The truffle mac and cheese was fantastic as well; my fiance chowed down on the roasted garlic pieces on top of his mashed potatoes.    The drinks run between $11-12, which is extremely reasonable, both for Vegas and for the quality of cocktail. I have never found a Ramos Gin Fizz for under $15 in any city, so I was excited to get such a complex drink for a good price. I also recommend the blackthorne; I've never had pineapple gomme before, but I want to put it in all my drinks now.   Moral of the story: go here. Go here for drinks with your friends, go here on a nice date with your SO, go here by yourself to pig out on delicious steak. My only regret about Herbs & Rye is that it's not located in my hometown. Amazing place.",

Friday's and Saturdays tend to get a little busy, so if you want to make it for the 12-3am happy hour, get there earlier!!! Happy hour is anything on the menu with 2 stars, I recommend the Filet, (half price) with the choice of a side, and any \"add on's\" you'd like to add to your steak. Ex; mushrooms and onions, bleu cheese, etc. *MELT IN YOUR MOUTH FILET!* Everything is always, so good. I will continue to come here and can't wait to try the pasta!!!",

Make it half price, $29 and fill the place up. I guess we are all suckers for a deal, even if it's a bad deal. How about $18 for calamari,not half off, it was like chewing bubble gum. $12 for a glass of Bad Merlot, maybe a 6oz. pour. I'm not a send my food back type of person, but that's what This place deserves. I should of know when I saw the table next to me sending their steaks back.            I don't mind paying for a quality cut of meat or a quality meal. We have plenty of great steak houses in Las Vegas. Trust me, this isn't one of them. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the waitress was excellent. Mad at myself for falling for the sucker deal!!",

The hostess, bar tender, and our waiter were really nice. I never post yelp reviews but i couldn't get over how much i liked this place. Okay thats not really why, i just wanted to point this out because ive never seen business reaponses so savage before to 1 stars. So, i was bored as hell at work, i work night shift, and im going over the reviews. And my co worker has gone here too so we were just talking about the place. I start reading these 1 stars and i come across nectaly M. responses from herbs and rye. They're savage af but pretty entertaining to say the least. My night flew by trying to find 1 stars, then crossing my fingers hoping...no...praying that there's a response from nectaly. I dunno, maybe ill even get a savage response. Well...now, we wait.",

The night started off well with some good conversation with the host and the physical look was quaint and rustic albeit a bit dark. The tomato bisque soup was off point, to tangy and not enough cream. The cocktail menu was extensive but the drink pours were very small. If I pay $15 for a decent whiskey I expect a decent pour. The meat and pork chops were the highlight of everyone's menu. Seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The sides that were hyped on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> such as truffle mac and cheese and sweet potato tots were disappointing. I would have given another 1/2 star except for the small drink pours. I also would have given another 1/2 star if the drink prices were better. Overall, a good place for steak and chops but they need specials and an improved happy hour to make it with the trip.",

    "text": "Ahh yes. Herbs and Rye. What a fabulous establishment. I've only been a couple of times, but I've quickly become a fan. They not only have excellent classic cocktails, they also have excellent food. This is far from your typical local bar.  Let me start with their cocktails. Their classic cocktail menu is unrivaled. I love poring through the pages in search of my next beverage. It's just so detailed and well thought out. If knowledge is power, then the Herbs and Rye menu will make you a Cocktail superhero. Every drink has a little tidbit about its origin. It's also organized in chronological order. Want something from the Prohibition era? Herbs and Rye has got you covered. Perhaps something from the Gothic Age of American Drinking? Wait. What the heck does that even mean? Regardless, they have your back on that too!  On the other side of the coin, Herbs and Rye has some fantastic food offerings. Did someone say happy hour? A selection of their steaks are half off during HH. On my first visit, I went with the Kansas City Strip Steak with a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese (during HH, you only get one side instead of two). While the steak was flavorful, I admit that I was envious of my neighbor's Flat Iron. I'll definitely get that one instead next time. Outside of their steaks, I've also had the Clams from the appetizer section (also half off during HH). OMG those were incredible. It's basically a bowl of clams in a buttery sauce of awesomeness. On the side come two pieces of toasted baguette. Trust me when I say those are not enough. I ended up asking for more bread just so I could soak them in that buttery goodness. Yes, I know. Healthy as can be.  Will I return? Is it hot in Vegas in July? Does it flash flood when it rains? Is it dark in here?",
