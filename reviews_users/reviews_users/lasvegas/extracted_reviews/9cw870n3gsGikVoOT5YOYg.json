Most of the pieces were dry, only one of them was perfectly crispy on the outside and melt-in-your mouth good on the inside.  Maybe it was an off night for the cook.  Still, I'll go back up a star thanks to the Hawaiian inspired baked roll that they had.  It was unique and tasty.  Most sushi places seem content to have just the same old (though very good) combinations that have been done to death everywhere else.",

My fiance and I were sat right away and our server was Ben. He was very attentive and suggested different things on the menu. We never felt rushed and really enjoyed our dinner. Ordered the spicy crispy tuna which was delicious, and the black tiger roll. We also ordered shrimp tempura which came with 4 pieces and shrimp tempura roll. Waters were always refilled and Ben was always around to be sure we were taken care of with anything else we needed. Sam the general manager also recommended the mochi ice cream which I had the green tea one. We live across the street and I see myself becoming a regular here.",

Their sushi selection is not as robust as in other places but in this case quality beats quantity. You won't find on their menu sushi like \"sex on the beach\" or \"Kiss the ass\". Their level is somewhere else - way up there. The environment is modern and spacey with great view on the valley West end and Red Rock. Their home sake was good. even though we live on the opposite side of town, we'll go back. Well worthy trip. Overall great experience.",

It's literally down the street from my house, which means I'll definitely become a regular.  All of our food was delicious and they did a great job with the decor and lighting.  We had the spicy Edamame which did come after my sashimi dinner and i wasn't thrilled about, but it tasted great so I could overlook the minor set back. First world problems lol All of the fish in my sashimi dinner was very fresh and they also had fresh pickled wasabi which is a huge deciding factor for me when distinguishing a quality sushi spot from not. The boyfriend had the pork belly which he loved, shishito peppers, agadashi tofu and soft shell crab. I tried everything but the pork and it was all equally as delish. The standout for me was the soft shell crab. Instead of tempura batter they used panko which made it so crispy and light. I think one of the best soft shell crab I've had yet. The GM Sam was also super cool and ensured we were happy with all from the beginning of our service and followed through until the very end. Even if you don't live in the hood it's worth the drive. I'm sure you'll visit the IKEA at some point so make a stop over to Pier 215 while you're there. We'll be back :)",

I can only imagine the view on the 4th of July from their dining area over looking the strip.  Japanese tapas are hard to come by and never would I think to try Japanese snapper carpacchio but am sure glad I did.  The tangy sauce was the perfect complement to the thinly sliced fish and the cilantro touch was just enough. My sushi-hating friends love that they have options such as melt-in-your mouth short ribs and chicken fettuccine alfredo.   The prices are a bit higher here, but you can be sure the product is that much fresher.  I often like to pop in for their lunch combination specials which are perfectly crafted to-go. The meals come with soup, salad and tempura! They even have a sushi burrito menu available which blows the competition away.  Needless to say, I'm glad it's so close to home and work.  Try this little spot before it gets too busy to get a table.",

We were going to do the Chef Premium Sashimi Platter, but our server said that they have a \"Seafood Tower\" special today.  Seafood Tower?? Omg how can I not?  The Seafood Tower commanded a 3 digit price, but 110% beat my expectations.  It had: King Crab legs, the **BEST** oysters I've had, clams, mussels, ceviche, and an assortment of sashimi.  I just want to point out again - they were the **BEST** oysters I've ever had. Yes that good.  We've also ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and Grilled Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar).  The Pork Belly was not as fatty as I would like it to be.  The Hamachi Kama was a bit lacking in serving size.     Service was attentive and great when we first arrived and ordered, but our server basically disappeared halfway through our meal.  I think they were a bit short staffed for the holiday.  Overall, I am very excited for a high quality seafood restaurant in the south west region.  The prices were a bit high regular dining out (i.e. vs $25 AYCE dinners).  I think the service hiccup was an anomaly.  I will definitely be back.",

Told us we could customize anything we'd like on the menu if we needed to - that was helpful but can be confusing at times. Maybe a small 8-10 item vegetarian menu could be useful for when you don't want to be a bother and keep asking about customizing and pricing. Would definitely go back again",

Also got an order of mixed tempura (loved the batter) my husband ordered the Korean Short Ribs which looked hearty, I didn't try it because I wasn't in the mood for meat. But I would definitely come back and order more.  So glad I found this place....maybe I can do my next GNO here!!!!!",

The food. Not to say that the food is bad, it's okay. It's just that there are sure a lot of lacking and mismatched flavors. I'm sure there might be a dish or two worth going back for. But for the price and portion sizes overall? Absolutely not worth it. It's like they took a regular dish, cut it in half, threw truffle oil and a leaf on it, gave it some fancy description, and doubled/tripled the price.   Please note that I do consider Firefly and Other Mama to also be \"Hipster Restaurants\". So if you like those places this might be the place for you. If not, then you will probably feel the way I do about this place.  ----------  Ordered: The 3 out of 4 dishes we ordered were recommended by the waiter as popular.  Crispy pork belly: The tiniest portion size known to man. Very plain. It just tastes like grilled pork belly with vinegar. You can get cheaper, tastier pork belly at literally any other asian restaurant.  Korean beef short ribs: OK portion size. Texture of meat was strange... super soft and falling apart. Pretty plain for korean short ribs. Expected more for the price. Again, you can get a cheaper, tastier version at any korean restaurant.   Miso Glazed Salmon: Pretty good. Actually liked this one. Bit pricey but I could see how it would get people to come back.   The Pier Roll: Your average sushi roll... except with a gallon of black pepper. It wasn't bad... it was just weird...? I like black pepper but the flavour just did not match and was pretty overpowering compared to the rest of the sushi roll.",

I also bring friends here on a regular basis.   I prefer the sushi over the other entrees (purely my tastes), as the flavors are wonderful and collaborate well together. The fusion elements of the dishes, however, make this a unique spot.   The sampler plates are quite good if you'd like to sample a few different types.   Overall - great food and for the most part - good service!",

Located in Spring Valley, close to the 215 Beltway, on the corner of Durango and Arby.  I dig the floor-to-ceiling windows, an industrial chic interior, looks very modern and oh the dark wood accents everywhere and spaciousness looks great.   We ordered the Sweet Garlic Chilli Edamame, Crispy rice with spicy tuna, Seafood Ceviche, and Spicy Pork Quesadilla from the Happy hour. We also ordered Crispy Pork belly from their regular menu.   This Asian-American fusion menu includes live lobster, clams, crab legs, ocean trout and oyster selections from the raw bar. Sushi and sashimi can be bought by the piece, with choices like giant clam and Japanese snapper. They had tapas choices includes pork belly, braised black cod, and tempura options.  Their featured specialties include chicken katsu, a New England style lobster roll and an Angus rib eye steak.  Some of the items on their regular menu were pricey. The food were 3stars to me but the service and ambiance are 4 stars.",

    "text": "Such pretty, photogenic dishes! I have been looking forward to going to Pier 215 for ages and finally made plans to go for a belated Valentines dinner with my guy. The location is nicely appointed and intimate, with twinkle lights and a great view. It's a date-night spot for sure. Menu is massive, something for everyone- and again, every dish comes out so beautifully. They really pay attention to plating, everything we had was so photogenic!  PANKO SOFT SHELL CRAB: I LOVE soft shell crab, and the presentation was fun on this one. But other than the actual crab, I didn't care for this dish. It's plated on pureed sweet potato, a flavor that failed to elevate or highlight the delicate crab flavors. And serving this with tartar sauce was also a bizarre choice that didn't really work. Maybe this would have benefitted from more of the honey-mustard instead. GARLIC BUTTER SEARED TUNA: Gorgeous, light, flavorful. Really liked this dish, and BF compared it to the version served at another of our favorite izakaya style spots in town. Fish was fresh, flavors were bright and harmonious. PAN ROASTED LITTLE NECK CLAMS: So conflicted! The mussels were huge and meaty, like the ones we had up in Canada. But the broth! It was so bland! That's supposed to be the highlight of a dish like this, and it needs to be served with a crusty bread to soak it up. This had so much potential!  CLAM MUSHROOM MISO SOUP: One of the more traditional menu items. The miso was muted and the clams were nice, and there was additional tofu and seaweed as expected. But I didn't come across a single mushroom.  SUSHI DINNER ($25): 10 pieces of nigiri + tuna roll. BF and I were in agreement that this was AYCE quality sushi. Fish was cut paper-thin, and several slices improperly. Half were cut against the grain, which kills the cell and destroys the flavor. These pieces were hard to chew and didn't highlight the buttery texture and fresh flavors of the fish. Very disappointing! Did we just get the sub-par remnants after they got slammed for the holiday?  215 ROLL: Went with their namesake roll ($22), packed with several ingredients (lobster, soft shell crab, asparagus, mango, micro cilantro, tuna, salmon, avocado, den miso sauce). Again, it was a gorgeous dish. But it just didn't work. Throwing all your best ingredients into a single roll doesn't work if the flavors aren't balanced. There were bits of fruitiness from the mango and crunch from the asparagus, but the fish was not highlighted and the roll was overwhelmingly dry. My guy refused to eat more than two pieces, which is unheard of.  We were disappointed with our meal. Maybe I would have fared better ordering from the pasta dishes and grilled meats featured in their \"specialties\" section. The quality does not match the expectation set by the price point. You eat with your eyes first, so maybe that's where the extra star or two come from in some of these rave reviews.    I plan to go back for the sashimi rice bowl for lunch and hope for a better experience. Maybe I'll return for their tapa and raw bar items, like the oysters and the octopus carpaccio. But as Rod U said, the fish quality is closer to AYCE than to the upscale caliber expected, unfortunately.",

    "text": "Every time I go back to Las Vegas to visit my friends and old stomping grounds, I stick to the same nostalgic routine. I eat at the same places that I loved when I lived there and bask in the memories.   This time though, it was recommended to me that I try a new place called Pier 215 and even though I was hesitant to change my ways, I gave it a shot.   First of all, I have never been more happy with a recommendation!! This place was so perfect. I went in with my fiance who is the biggest grump I k now and even he was impressed.   The atmosphere hit me first. It is hip and sexy, but also romantic. With the mellow EDM music in the background, it's not your run of the mill restaurant, but it maintains that Vegas edginess that I love.   Speaking of Vegas edginess, the place is wrapped in floor to ceiling windows out of which you can see the ENTIRE strip! Lit up in all its glory. So cool.   Then you see the open kitchen, feel the beautiful decor, and the fragrance of the food hits you... it is a synesthetic feast before you even sit down.   So by the way it was a Tuesday when we went in which could not have been more perfect as they half off bottles of wine on Tuesday. We got the Nuthouse Pinot Noir (by Argyle) from Willamette Valley Oregon and it was exactly as delicious as it sounds.   Our server was fantastic.  Her knowledge was on point and she was able to GUIDE us through our dining experience instead of just taking our order. She was engaged and passionate and every recommendation she made, we ordered, and we were so happy we did. Here's what we had:  BEEF SHORT RIBS: braised to perfection, shiitake and beech mushrooms, blistered shishito peppers, adorable baby zucchinis, and potatoes.   SALMON: a tender filet of salmon belly (marbled with fatty goodness) which is yuzu infused, with a mustard crime fraiche and soy salt.   ... I know! Amazing.   Now we made the mistake of eating just an hour before we dined so we were too full to go on, but I am telling you this place is my NEW nostalgia. Every time I go back to Vegas, you will find me here at least once.   I could not recommend it any more highly. You will love it!   If you don't believe me, check out the pictures. They, as cliched as it sounds, speak 1000 words.  :)",

We weren't very hungry so just wanted to share a few items, planning on coming back to try more items.   We got half dozen kumamoto oysters and boy were those good! Cute presentation, served ice cold, 4 different types of sauces you can mix and match, the oysters were sweet and crunchy, awesome start to the meal. We also got sweet garlic chili edamame which I thought was too salty, too much sauce on top but nice flavor. Fried oysters was ok, batter a little too thick but their tartar sauce was really good, I usually hate tartar sauce but theirs were not to spicy and has a nice soft sweetness to it.   We got the steak tobanyaki which was really good, but really small for $29, although the meat was really tender, awesome flavors, even the mushroom, asparagus and veggies on the plate were really sweet and delicious. We go the sushi dinner which was good, came with a bowl of rice. We also got the Hawaiian Breeze roll which was pretty good, a little small for the price but was tasty.   Overall really enjoyed the meal, they have some interesting items, price is not too crazy spicy. I love the overall feel of the place, very attentive and great service but not uptight. Will definitely come back to try more items.",

I found them through Yelp and put it on our list of restaurants to choose from when we are having a hard time deciding. So, Thursday night, I brought this place up.   The atmosphere and decor on the inside is very nice. The kitchen is open to see and the restaurant is not very large. It is the perfect size and can accommodate some larger parties. Once complaint about the atmosphere is that all the windows face West which brings glaring sun in the afternoon. They have some solar shades that come down but they do not quite handle the issue. The second complaint about the environment is the music. It is very loud. It made it difficult to carry on a conversation.   We ordered some sushi and teriyaki bowls. I did not bring the most adventurous eaters here and may have to rethink my guests in the future. But everything was fresh and delicious. For a teriyaki bowl, it was very impressive and the serving size was generous. I ordered the vegetable tempura and it was phenomenal. Crispy and flavorful. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. We had a crunchy roll which was very good as well.   I definitely plan to visit this place again soon. For the three of us, it was $62.00 with two cocktails on the bill. We ordered very carefully but it can be pricey if you do not play the menu right.",

I ordered tons of sushi for us and it came to our table extremely slow. Besides the speed, there was way too much rice on the sushi. I was picking off the rice. The presentation for all the rolls were nice but we weren't satisfied with the taste. All the rolls were mediocre. For the price of each roll, it wasn't worth it. The single tapas I ordered was great though. You can't got wrong with tempura in a Japanese restaurant! The crab legs were so crunchy and flavorful. The presentation of this dish was mouth watering and it truly was a great dish. Besides the speed of the food arriving at our table, the waiter was very polite and was on top of our drinks. We both had an order of mochi ice cream for dessert and I was sort of hoping for a fresh mochi but it wasn't. And it was tiny too. They split it open and add whip cream for it to be more appealing to the eye. The mochi skin was hard. Maybe I just had to wait for it to come to room temperature? I've had numerous ice cream mochi before so I know the softer, cheer mochi dough exist on the frozen aile.",

It tasted like our Filipino lechon kawali, tasty and delicious. We had the Asian Boullabaise, tasty, serving just enough to share and scallops in brown rice risotto. I usually do not like brown rice but this is cooked perfectly. Topped the delicious dinner with a crunchy strawberry cheesecake. Oh, they have a Tuesday special, wine at half off so we finished a bottle of Malbec.",

Everything was clean and the staff was very put together. The general manager sat my roommate and I down. He was super nice and introduced us to our waiter Ben. Ben was very well spoken and had a lot of knowledge of the menu and made some good suggestions. We ordered a bottle of sake because it was half off, we got a bottle of Nambu Bijin Shinpaku. It was smooth and had a very rounded flavor. We got two of each oyster, but my favorite by far was the Kumamotos. The wasabi salsa was EVERYTHING!!! I don't normally like wasabi, but the salsa was fire. They used fresh wasabi. I literally could eat it by itself. SOOOO BOMB! The Assorted Japanese pickles were tasty, as well as the crispy rice with spicy tuna. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the 215 roll. It just reminded me of a donut. Overall, the service was amazing, food delicious, and ambiance was perfect. Definitely will be a regular here considering I live down the street.",

When we entered the restaurant, there was no one to greet us and we had to wait to someone to even see us in. Note that at the time of our visit, they were only serving one other table and four others as we were leaving, so they were not remotely close to being busy. Long story short, they managed to forget one of our orders and forget about the check we requested at the end of our meal. For a restaurant at the price point, I expected way better service.  P.S. The food was delicious. But it's hard to enjoy it when it's coupled with bad service.",

I was seated promptly; the excellent customer service started with the hostess.  Our waiter was very patient and kind. We never felt rushed- before we knew it 3 hours had passed! Onto the food! From the HH menu, we ordered sweet garlic chili edamame and spicy rock shrimp. The edamame were addicting and I could not stop eating it. It had just enough heat for this wuss to tolerate it. The shrimp had a light batter that was not overpowering, accompanied with a sauce that complemented it. My friends also enjoyed Moscow Mules. For our main courses we got several of the special rolls: Hawaiian breeze, Pier, and Two Fifteen. I also got agedashi tofu to go. Everything was delicious. One of my friends is new to sushi and she really enjoyed the Hawaiian roll. for dessert, we got green tea creme brulee and fried cheesecake. Overall, this is one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I look forward to my next visit to Pier 215.",

I loved the grilled shrimp over the bed of uni (sea urchin) risotto. Yummmm albeit overpriced $37 yikes!! I wish I knew the price before ordering. It was definitely delicious, but I'm not so sure its worth almost forty bucks! The chicken teriyaki was more reasonable but equally as scrumptious!",

I see that the reviews for this restaurant are sort of all over the place so I assume that based on what you order, you will either love it or hate it.   We mostly ordered from the tapas menu so I cannot speak for the rolls or sushi, but all the tapas we ordered were great. I think the prices matched as well when compared with similar Japanese tapas restaurants around town. I especially loved the beef tataki and the crispy pork belly. We also ordered the Asian bouillabaisse which has a really good broth and decent quality shellfish and ingredients, but I honestly thought was way too overpriced at $25.  The service was frequent, friendly, and helpful. The atmosphere was also very nice with good music in the background. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back again.",

The quality of food and service is exceptional as to be expected as the Chef/Owner came from the famous Nobu.  They have half priced wine bottles on Tuesdays and an awesome Sake list as well.

The food was delicious. We started with a Caprese Salad. What a great way to start lunch. The salad was flavorful and the dumplings added not only a unique flavor, but a nice temperature contrast as well. I could have had just this for lunch and been very happy.  We got a side order of the truffle fries, these were HOT when they hit the table. It was hard to wait for them to cool down as they tasted sooooo good.   I had the Combination Beef Teriyaki Lunch with brown rice. The flavors popped. The tempura vegetables were cooked well and made a nice side. The house salad that came with the meal was delicious. I can honestly say eating salads is normally not my thing, but the salads here had flavor!  Pier 215 is worth the drive. Find a way to get there and enjoy!",

There have been families with children eating here too which makes it a good family restaurant as well. The service is really great because both times we were seated right away and the server came back to check on us just the right amount of times to let us look over the menu and during dinner.   We tried the rock shrimp walnut salad, salmon skin salad, crispy rice spicy tuna, crispy pork belly, kuushi oysters, yellowtail roll, and cajun shrimp penne. I loved everything and will be coming back in the future for dinner again and possibly lunch!",

I was intrigued by the \"view\" as you can see the Strip from a distance.   The interior was beautiful with lots of opportunity for a romantic date. Men, bring your significant other here and you'll get lots of brownie points.   The food was delicious! I ordered their special which was the miso salmon steak. It's a bit on the pricey side but the flavors really deliver. It's sweet on the exterior and tender everywhere else. Pair it with risotto and you're in for an ultimate experience. It was one of those entrees you wished was bigger just to eat for pleasure. So good.   My girlfriend got a lobster roll and all ingredients worked in a harmonious effort. From the avocado for the sauce, you're really tasting different flavors that truly completes the meal.   We also got dessert which was ice cream with macarons. The taste is a bit underwhelming as the vanilla ice cream seemed just a tad basic. It's served in a cone bowl which made the meal fun and three assorted macarons. Now, the highlight of this dessert were the macarons because they're light and live up to their designated flavors.",

He check on us occasionally to make sure everything was okay. He was very attentive, Not only to us, but to all his tables that he was serving. 5 stars for his customer service! The food was great. We got the angus steak, the pork cutlet with mash potatoes, and the angry lobster roll. steak was perfectly cooked and the angry lobster roll was really delicious!

They were all delicious in different ways but the seared tuna was my favorite. The pier 215 roll is very tasty as well. Someone at our table had the scallops with risotto which they also enjoyed.  For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake which was actually underwhelming, and the macaroon sundae which was really good!!

We also had the cooked Hamachi, very delicious.  Next up was the Rock shrimp salad it was similar to Bang Bang Shrimp from Bonefish Grill, up next was a roll recommended by Our waiter the BLT roll I forget what was on it but it was also delicious. We also did the meatball skewers which consisted of 2 pork and beef meatballs which was not great but good. We finished off with the Red Velvet cake which I was not to impressed with it seemed to be at least 2 or 3 days old.  All in all it was a good meal, the service and attention to us was top notch.

However, I'm not sure if I got the whole experience everyone seemed to portray.  The ambience, interior, energy is amazing. If felt as if I wasn't in Las Vegas. The menu was easily organized and a variety of options; sushi, pork, chicken & seafood. This place has just enough options to appease to all types of cravings. & with new openings comes areas of improvements; delayed service and incorrect food items & charged incorrectly. We had ordered the Angry Lobster Roll & the description I read did not match what I ate. There was shrimp tempura in it. Needless to say I ate it but would except the roll to be just as the description. Also, I ordered the hot green tea for 2. To my knowledge when this is ordered, one kettle is served for 2. Instead our server decided to bring each one of us our own pot.  Overall the experience was mediocre. I was expecting a lot more in the sense of food. Maybe my selections weren't the best but I will return again for another attempt at my neighborhood sushi joint.",

    "text": "I had such a great time here with my friends last Saturday and I can't wait to go back to this restaurant with my husband tomorrow.   First, food has great quality. I can see the chef's creativity and many items on the menu cannot be found from other typical sushi restaurant. This place great for sushi eater, seafood lover, and non-sushi eater. I ordered oyster, sushi platter, teriyaki tsukune (the best), crispy pork belly, chicken wings, and fettuccine with fish cutlet. I liked all of them.   Second, the servers are attentive and the manager is very professional and friendly.   Third, it's got the great ambiance. Contemporary interior with the best view in town. I've never seen a local sushi restaurant has a view from Summerlin to the Strip from your table and night view is even better. Open kitchen is a plus!   Price is very reasonable as well. I know I'll be a regular to Pier 215.",

The atmosphere in the restaurant was very elegant and cozy with an unobstructed view of the city. This restaurant caters an Italian/American/Asian cuisine. I absolutely enjoyed every plate that was brought to our table! My faves were the 215 roll, Hawaiian breeze roll, octopus carpaccio and my Asian take on the bouillabaisse!  The service was top notch. They catered to a mistake my mom made in ordering and also provided a toddler proof food tray for my 1yr old.  I will definitely be back and I'm probably going to have my birthday dinner here as well!",

We started with each of us choosing a roll. We ordered the Dragon, Crispy, Spicy Salmon and one other roll (can't remember the name), as well as a sashimi sampler. All of the fish was fresh and came to our table quickly. We then each ordered a lunch special. I ordered the sushi lunch which came with a California Roll and the chefs choice of 5 prices of sashimi, miso soup, salad and mixed tempura. Again all of the fish was fresh and the lunch plate was large. I was worried this place would be pricey but the price point for amount of food received was perfect. I can't wait to come back here and try more!",

The waiters know the menu front to back, they are very very very attentative to their customers, and they lighten up everyone's mood.  The oysters here are soooooo fresh. I recommend this place if you want some oysters. Their tappas dishes are also highly recommended if you want a lot of different dishes and flavors.  Now, for the bad news. Their sushi and rolls are not good and they made me and my family lose our appetite after a while. Their fish is actually not the issue. Actually their fish is super fresh (so in this case a cappacio or sashimi will be good). But the problem was their rice. I could not quite pin what type of rice they used, but it wasn't sushi rice. The rice was sooooo dry and it stuck to my teeth. The rice also tasted funky. I have no idea why their rice was so bad, but it definitely ruined my meal. Unless the rice is changed to quality sushi rice, I probably won't be returning to this place.",

I have seen pictures of the Deep Fried Dumplings and I am glad they were Pan Fried when I visited. It is clear that the management reads your reviews and is willing to make adjustments to please their guests.  The Tempura Shrimp is light and crispy with a hot, but not overcooked, shrimp center. If you look closely you can see the tiny bubbles in the batter adding to the airy crispness of the shrimp tempura. The batter itself has been nice and golden brown each time we've ordered it. This has become a requirement for me at Pier 215.  Crispy Pork Belly with Kochujang Miso and Balsamic Soy is a hit for me. The pork belly had a crispy exterior with a soft center that just dissolved as I ate it. It was such a nice combination of texture and flavor. I always end up hoarding that dish and saving the kochujang miso and balsamic soy sauce to try it with the other food that I ordered. Next time I'll order it on the side if I can. I especially like eating this tapas with the Kinchi Fried Rice with Pork Belly, which is excellent on its own.  I enjoyed the Sushi Sampler. The fish always tastes fresh and each piece is always dressed and at a proper temperature. That kind of attention brings out a nice bright flavor. The same can be said about the other nigiri we ordered. I have not experienced the issues with the sushi rice as some others have indicated. The rice has always been at a good temperature, neither over or under cooked with a pleasant acidity. In most cases I am more particular about the rice than I am with the neta.  The Scallops and Brown Rice Risotto are a treat. The risotto and scallops were cooked perfectly. The scallops were slightly opaque in the middle with a thoroughly cooked exterior and a nice smoky flavor coming from the grill marks.  I love scallops. One of the tiny voices in my head is a Gordon Ramsay clone and he comes out when scallops and risotto are sensed.   I could go on singing praises about the food and the service here, but this review is turning into an article. Stop by and try it for yourself. The food here is presented beautifully, service is excellent, and the ambiance is very pleasing. I will be returning here soon and I hope you get a chance to enjoy Pier 215 as I have.",

He was very very handsome and suave, me and my BF loved him!  The inside is so beautiful we got a table with the view. We started off with two oyster shooters and hot sake which was PERFECT temperature it didn't burn me!!!!!!!!  Food: the lotus roll was a 6/10 wasn't very good but it was fresh but I hate surimi crab haha. Sweet after taste and the flavors don't really come together.  Wasabi and ginger a 10/10  Sushi dinner 10/10 so amazing and fresh fish  The o toro I died, it was so amazing and buttery and delicious. I didn't eat ginger after so I could keep the taste in my mouth  The oysters were FREAKING AWESOME and huge.   The yellow tail salsa was amazing too!  Miso soup was fresh and so was the gyoza! Not too over fried  My only complaint is that they forgot like 4 of our items and we have to remind them 3+ times but that's okay!! I love this place! I will be back",

The ambiance is beautiful. Dressing up would be appropriate. But this place doesn't give off a stuffy vibe either. I don't usually eat at the bar in a restaurant but it looked so inviting! Next time I think I'll sit there.   The chefs/cooks have the most adorable uniforms! Ben, our server understood that we were just taking our time here to indulge in a few things. So he coursed our meal throughout the night. He was very knowledgable, professional and friendly. Sam, the general manager also checked up on us throughout to get feedback and ensured our satisfaction.   The food was awesome.  Pacific and Fanny Bay oysters were super fresh. The sauces were ok. I'd prefer a little spicier horseradish/cocktail sauce/ponzu. But that's just preference.   OCTOPUS CARPACCIO omg this was the highlight of the night!! I could've ate like 10 plates of this...for reals!   Beef Tataki was good. I'm glad I tried it but I could probably skip this dish next time around.  Rock Shrimp walnut salad was excellent! Perfect combo of flavors and textures.   Crispy pork belly...oh so good!! I loved this dish a lot! The flavors were amazing! They were bite size which was great but just a tad too crispy....but it is \"crispy\" pork belly so I can't really complain there.   Usuzukuri was clean and simple whitefish sashimi dish in a flavorful ponzu sauce and spicy grated daikon. This was a nice finish.  Also had the negi toro cut roll which is always amazing can't mess that up.   But unfortunately we weren't fans of the BLT roll or the Flaming Ahi roll.   I'm determined to try one of their specialty rolls that I could rave about! Sam did mention the Lotus Roll to be a favorite so maybe try that next.",

Food: I ordered a salmon avocado roll and 5 orders of salmon belly nigiri the salmon belly was some of the best I have ever had. It was very fatty and delicious! The salmon avocado roll was amazing, the rice was cooked so well and had a lot of flavor, and the fish and avocado was so fresh! My boyfriend ordered the  Shrimp penne in vodka sauce: seriously was the best we have both ever had! It was so good!! The shrimp were juicy and delicious!  Dessert: we had the cheese cake.

The large windows gives a very special vibe to the place. We tried the pork belly tapas, which was good but a bit dry. However, the sauce was very tasty. We also got the yellow jalapeno salsa. This dish was great and is a must order. The freshness of the fish and the sauce made it a very refreshing and satisfying dish. The teriyaki bowl was surprisingly good. This is not your typical cheap meal. The meat was perfectly cooked and had good season to it. The pacific oysters were pretty large, fresh and tasty. I would also recommend to order it.  The Hawaiian breeze roll had a very unique flavor to it. Not my favorite, bit definitely interesting. And last but not least, we ordered some sashimi. Every piece was fresh and tasty. We also had the opportunity to talk to sam (the manager) who told us that his chefs came from Nobu and Citizens. The service was also very good. Overall, a good place to try out!",

Our sins shared the chicken katsu which was definitely enough to share and then some. My husband and I had the Angry Lobster roll, Hawaiian Breeze roll, and Black Tiger roll. Great flavors!

    "text": "Giving Pier 215 2 stars just breaks my heart, but unfortunately it's exactly how it is. Now mind you, I went to this restaurant TWICE. Went to dinner with my friend then went back the next night to take my parents and husband.  If I hadn't gone the next night with my parents I wouldn't have given them 2 stars. I would have given them 5 stars all the way. HOWEVER, the service on my second night- which counted the most to me because I was with my parents and husband was so awful it dropped them to 2 stars.  The second night dinner, they served appetizers at a decent pace. But it was the entree service where everything just dropped in service and food! They served my dad's fish and chips first and literally from that point on everyone else's entrees was served a pain staking 10 minutes later, and no still not at once! I mean next entree was served 10 minutes, then the next 10 minutes the next entree and the next 10 minutes and finally my entree which was scallops risotto came. Ruined the mood, as I felt like my dad had already finished his mean and I barely started. Also my husband ordered the braise short ribs and again, server forgot his rice! We sat there 5 minutes trying to find her and figuring out where the rice was.  The server didn't check up on us and she did say the dishes were delayed but no, it was beyond delayed. Who is expediting? They can't time our food correctly? Also where was the GM? I saw him walking around, and not even an Hello or kitchen explanation on the delayed food. So disappointing!  Food was great, no doubt. But the short ribs were tough. Definitely expected it to be much more tender.  So disappointed at this place. I had a fantastic first experience and it was flawless from service to food, but unfortunately literally the next day I dined here it was night and day. As if they all just give you that dog and pony show the first night only to trick you to come in next time to have the worst service ever!!  They could've done better. Especially when they set that standard for me the first night, you best your ass I am pissed when you barely even delivered the next night.  Service, kitchen expediting needs work!",

Not a view you'd find just anywhere in Vegas. Plus the service was very good. The waiter was prompt, knowledgeable and friendly as was the rest of the staff. Great teamwork.   I liked giving their raw oysters a try. You can mix and match as you please. My favorite was the Kumamoto oysters. Just delicious and super fresh. The sashimi bowl lunch special had a good variety of sashimi pieces. Mine included mackerel, salmon, yellowtail , octopus, salmon roe, and sweet egg cut into square bites. My only dislike was that the rice was super hot which is fine normally for a hot dish but not ideal when it's the bed for sashimi. Usually sushi rice is supposed to be cooled/fanned a little prior to placing the sliced sashimi on top of it just because the heat of the rice heats up the sashimi which isn't good. I think it may have been because we came in 15 minutes after they had opened. I don't think they had time to cool the rice. We noticed the same thing with the a la carte sushi that we ordered. Again, the quality of the fish was great but the hot rice made the fish warm and took away from the experience a bit.   I know this place is new, so my one little dislike isn't that big of a deal. I'd definitely come back to try out there other dishes.",

The restaurant looks super nice but isn't something you notice right away at the end of the lot.   So glad we came here! The service was exceptional from the hostess walking in to our waiter. We got the iced teas and they were super flavorful, yet still light.   The food is a great! The chef's definitely know what they're doing. The sushi was good. The pork belly was amazing. The steak was phenomenal! We ended up ordering another steak because I ate half of my husband's. It's that good.   Amazing staff, amazing food and an incredible, intimate setting. We've been raving to our friends, which some have already went & loved it. We will definitely be back to Pier 215!",

Came in here for a very late lunch on a Saturday, place was fairly empty - to be expected since it seems like a good late night hangout. We actually sat down just in time for happy hour. They were very accommodating of our party of four which had two kids. The decor of the restaurant was just beautiful - very clean, very modern.  We ordered the happy hour oysters $1 each - chefs choice. They were smaller in size but had a nice sweet taste to them.  Wife got the scallop risotto - wow.  I had to steal some. The scallops were huge and the flavor and texture of the risotto was A+. They also have an uni risotto for you uni fans - might try it next time.   I ordered the chefs premium sushi - what a beautiful presentation. The toro had caviar and bits of gold leaf on it! What attention to detail! The piece of (what I thought was tamago) cake on the very far right of my pic was actually a very light piece of pound cake that had their logo embossed in it, how cool. My 10 month old son ended up grabbing a piece of it before I got to it. Haha  Service - everyone was so friendly. The place was so clean and well kept. Just to show what attention to detail this place pays attention to - one of the other waiters was polishing the lamps on top of the other tables.  Keep up the good work guys!",

    "text": "Pier 215 had some exceptional food which came out fairly quickly after ordering.  After having this place bookmarked for quite some time, we finally stopped by while driving in the area.  The restaurant was clean and the large windows gave plenty of nice, natural lighting to the nicely decorated, dark decor.   Not crowded at all, we were delighted to see there was a happy hour going on and we were seated very quickly.  Off the HH menu, we ordered the corkscrew shrimp and a half-dozen oysters.  At $1 a piece, the oysters were fresh and tasty.   Accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemon, and horseradish, I enjoyed the slightly briny oysters and could have ate more.   The corkscrew shrimp, with its mildly-hot sauce, was a good appetizer.    My wife had a brown rice risotto with cooked salmon.  The fish was cooked to your liking and the risotto was your standard version, nothing extraordinary, but good.  I had the 215 roll.  It came with a plethora of fillings and toppings which included salmon, tuna, yellowtail, softshell crab, lobster, mango, avocado, and yuzu truffle.    The plating and presentation was nice.   I didn't think the flavors nearly matched how it looked though.   It's possible there was just too much contrasting items that you could not really pick our or enjoy each individual flavor.  Beyond that, my daughter had a Philadelphia roll, gyoza, and truffle fries which were pretty good.  Our server was a little soft-spoken, almost hard to hear at times.   It also took way too long to get our check, give the credit card, and get the copy back for signature.  Especially when there was maybe only one other group dining in at the time.    Beyond that, no real problems.  I would eat here again if in this side of town.",

Service: Very good. Waiters came by often to make sure the food was satisfactory and that we had water at all times.   Food: Delicious! We ordered plenty of food, including sunset roll, oysters, pork belly, octopus carpaccio, yellowtail jalapeno salsa, and the uni risotto. Everything was delicious, but the highlights for me were definitely the uni risotto and the octopus carpaccio. Definitely will re-order those when we return!  Price: Higher end, but reasonable.  Overall: A strong recommend, especially if there is a 2 hour wait at Master Kim's and you're there anyway! lol",

The reason I didn't give this place five stars is because of the food, and let's be real, it's mostly about the food, right? Right. Although the miso glazed salmon risotto was buttery, creamy and flavorful, the other two sushi rolls we ordered were just blahh. Surprisingly these rolls were highly recommended from the waitress and she labeled them as their, \"best selling rolls.\" Eek!  We were there during their reverse happy hour and didn't order anything from the discounted menu since it was pretty underwhelming as far as the food options.   Good, central location especially since I live in Henderson and most of my friends live in the Summerlin area.  HELPFUL TIP(S): If you like chocolate, order the Nutella mousse crunch cake! We were so full after dinner but of course he ordered dessert anyway. The presentation was perfect but most importantly it was just orgasmic! The type of dessert that makes your eyes roll in the back of your head if you know what I mean. You'll thank me later. :)",

    "text": "Went here for Valentine's day dinner. It was just a couple stores down from the gym I go to. Literally just finished hitting the gym and drove over to this trendy and modern location.   We had made reservations but were 10 mins late. They still accommodated us and the hostess tried her best to get us their next open table. It was quite busy in there but the staff seemed to have their stuff together. The ambience felt romantic; dim lights, good music, and good food.   My boyfriend and I started off with an appetizer of their salmon skin salad which was a pretty big portion, serves for 2-3. We also got their sale @ happy hour price- . As for entrees, I had their miso grazed salmon with brown rice risotto (yum!) and my other half got their angus steak which he seemed to enjoy.   We didn't go for anything on their raw menu which seemed to be a popular item that night but I'd love to go back and try whatever else they got to offer.   Our server was awesome, he gave us some recommendations and also explained things in more detail when we had questions about their menu. Before we left, we also got chocolate (Ferrero Rocher) handmade roses from the hostess. It showed their thoughtfulness for their customers, plus, they're one of my fave kinds of chocolates, so I had two!",

And the restaurant was nice and welcoming. Staff was kind and attentive.  Probably will try it again. And try one of the specialty rolls but probably wouldn't be my first spot to turn to for my sushi fix. Got the veggie tempura, Philly roll, Hawaiian breeze roll, and shrimp nigiri.  Veggies were good and not soggy like some places. Philly roll was fresh Gave the shrimp nigiri to my son. He enjoyed it The Hawaiian breeze roll was different. Couldn't really taste the pineapples. I am not a big fan of having lots of sauce on sushi but I was wanted to try something different. More than likely won't order it again. I like using garlic ponzu instead of soy sauce. The garlic ponzu sauce didn't taste like it had much flavor so I just ate the rolls with the Wasabi.",

    "text": "I've been hearing great things about this place for quite a while now, but this was my first time dining here. It definitely lived up to my expectations. I came in with my husband and my parents, who were visiting from Southern California. Coming from somewhere where they have access to exceptional seafood, my parents tend to be a bit picky in this area, but they were very happy with everything as well.  Since it was our first visit, our server Naomi took the time to explain the menu to us and to recommend a few popular dishes. I took her up on one of her suggestions and had the miso glazed salmon with brown rice risotto. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the glaze was rich and a little bit sweet. My husband had the beef short ribs, which were tender and juicy. My mom ordered the shrimp and scallop tobanyaki (served on a sizzling hot plate) which she said was exactly what she had envisioned in her mind. My dad had the chef's sashimi sampler and raved about the freshness of all the fish and how it melted in his mouth.   The atmosphere was great and it was easy for us to have a conversation while we dined. The service was attentive but not overpowering. We loved the strings of lights draped from the ceiling, providing a cozy atmosphere that was perfect for our intimate family dinner. It would have been great for a date night too, something my husband and I definitely plan on doing here in the near future.   The wine list, although not extensive, was decent and affordably priced. The food menu included so many options that we all had trouble settling on just one thing to order. We will definitely be back again in the future to work our way through more of the menu. It's so great to have such a wonderful restaurant so close to home. The view of The Strip from the window wasn't bad either!",

    "text": "I was excited to come here after hearing that Vegas finally has what was supposed to be a \"5 Star, Fine Dining Seafood Restaurant\" . After my San Diego trip, I set my expectations high and was ready to dive into some more delicious seafood.   ... And this was not the place for that!   I ended up ordering their Pacific Oyster, Kumamoto Oyster, and the Kusshi oyster to start off, I've heard great things about their oysters and was ready to try them for myself until my friend stopped me and spotted an aquatic worm wriggling around in one of the oysters! I instantly called back the waiter and told him that i wanted to return the oysters as I wasn't comfortable eating them anymore, how could I?! The waiter then proceeds to apologize and claim that the worm was there due to the oysters being fresh, really now? I guess anytime I order something and it has a worm in it, then it must be fresh, lucky me. The owner then comes around and notifies me that they have removed the oysters from my tab, walks away, and shares a good laugh with the waiter. Well at least they're happy : - )   Moving on.  My group also ordered  Seafood Ceviche: an assortment of shrimp/scallops topped off with a Lime garnish   Miso Glazed Salmon Steak: 6oz Salmon steak on top of a brown rice risotto.  Flaming Ahi Roll: seared Tuna, spicy tuna, asparagus, sliced jalapeno, w/ garlic ponzu sauce  Kimchi Fried Rice Sashimi Salad  The Glazed Salmon was marinated perfectly, not too salty and didn't have a strong fish smell or taste, the brown rice risotto complimented it perfectly, bit too much sauce on the rice though, was a bit overwhelming.    Seafood Ceviche tasted was just average, refreshing, nothing bad about it but nothing worth bragging about either.   The Flaming Ahi roll was below average, I don't understand how it's supposed to be \"Flaming\" when the heat level of the roll is equivalent to tabasco sauce. Couldn't really get much flavor from the tuna. Overall the roll was bland, boring, and I'm sure as far as rolls go, they have better options.     Kimchi fried rice here was very delicious, not overcooked, flavorful, and the kimchi taste wasn't overwhelming. Highly Recommended. Definitely the highlight of the meal      The Sashimi salad was beautifully presented, with taste to match. Fresh, but nothing amazing.   All in all, due to the poor service and low quality food I will definitely not be returning anytime soon, Vegas still has better options as far as seafood goes, and I'd rather head over to Other Mama's for some fresh, Worm-Free Oysters !",

To be entirely honest, the pace of the dinner was slow but that was only because we were waiting for one of our friends to come (this was not the fault of the restaurant). After his arrival though, everything went smoothly. From telling us about the background of the restaurant to being patient with us throughout the entire night, Adrian (our server) was the best of the best. The food was excellent and well-presented; Adrian mentioned the fact that the chefs were from Nobu and Yellowtail and it definitely showed.   We will be back and will only continue to come back until we get the chance to try every single dish - it is that worth it.   Good job, Pier 215.",

    "text": "I love this place! I love it. I wish I could give it 6 stars.   First of all let me say that they sell tea here from a company called \"Republic of Tea\" and these teas are amazing. I've tried to buy them elsewhere but apparently they're only available to distributors in large-quantity orders. Next time I'm here I need to ask if they'll sell me a case of them. If you like tea, give these a shot. They have all kinds of flavors.   My go-to meal here is the Fish & Chips. So well done. The batter outside is so crisp but not greasy or overcooked, and has good flavor but is not overpowering. The fish inside is tender and flaky, not dry at all, and is seasoned well. The fries are well-cooked and taste great. The tartar sauce is just right although I do wish they'd give me just a little more! I always seem to run out when I'm on my last piece of fish, and have to scrape the bowl for the last little bit. I love these fish & chips.  I've also had a few of their sushi rolls. Now let me say that I am not a big sushi person. The raw fish tastes fine, but I have problems with texture, so when I get rolls I always get rolls with baked or fried ingredients. I have had a few different rolls here, like the California roll and the BLT roll. All of the ones I have tried have been great.  For appetizer I usually go with the caprese salad. It's got gnocchi in it! Great salad. Delicious. If I were in the mood for just salad, I could have this and be totally set. My wife likes it too, and it's large enough that we can have one to share and I still have room for more, or we could eat it as a stand-alone meal.  The only thing I've had here that I would say is not 5-star is the quesadilla. The flour tortilla that they are made with is really over-powering. I taste more tortilla flavor than any of the ingredients inside. I would prefer a corn tortilla to be honest, but if I have to have flour they should find one with a milder flavor. No big deal though, because I've really settled on fish & chips every time I come here.",

I don't feel like I got $172 worth of food.  The Amberjack uni thing was way too tart.  Totally did not taste the fish at all.  Some of the oysters we had we not properly shucked.  I had pieces of broken shell on top of my oyster.  And 2 of the oysters looked like the person was ate half of it.  Uni was good, but at $6 per piece of nigiri, I wouldn't order it again.  Flaming ahi roll was ok, but there was something in the roll that made the whole thing taste a bit weird.  There was a bitter flavor.  Yellowtail jalapeno salsa was the best thing there.  I really enjoyed it.  Don't think I'll be going back.  Minus the oysters, I feel like I can get the same quality of stuff at some of the better AYCE places in town.",

Admittedly, I didn't read the whole review in Seven, so I can't say if I'm agreeing or disagreeing with their assessment.   Ambience - lovely.  The views are really nice and it felt upscale without being pretentious. Quick service when we arrived and the server was very friendly.  First thing ordered - the Seafood Nacho.  NOT impressed.  The dish relied heavily on what tasted like thousand island dressing (though it was probably spicy mayo). The dish was very bland and I would definitely not recommend it. It also had a heap of sour cream on top that didn't go with the dish at ALL. No Bueno for the first taste of Pier 215.  Next up, we ordered the Sushi Dinner - 10 pieces of sushi and a tuna roll.  (The server asked if there was anything we didn't like, so that was great.) The sushi was roughly about one thousand ones better than the appetizer. I was impressed with how the fish melted in my mouth.  The rice was a liiiiiittle bit dry but not bad. The best nigiri was the salmon, the tuna, and the snapper. The giant clam was really interesting - if you haven't had it, definitely try it.   The final thing we ordered was the Flaming Ahi roll - this was excellent!   Total bill was $80 for two of us (including 1 beer).  Will I come back? Maybe for the nigiri, but avoid that \"Seafood Nacho\" at all costs.   We finished up with the",

What a wonderful experience we had, from the classy chic atmosphere to the warm friendly service to the delicious food (pics attached).  We started off with the edamame, and split the caprese salad.  I will definite order the caprese salad again, and again and again!  It was unlike any I've ever tasted!  It came with fresh greens, a not too acidic balsamic vinaigrette, tomato and mozzarella balls and my favorite part - fried parmesan gnocchi!  I know, fried gnocchi in a caprese?  It totally works, and it was so delish!  I ordered the Korean short ribs and my fiance had the miso glazed salmon - both were amazing!  I also ordered kimchi on the side.  It was fresh and a little crunchy - absolutely perfect!  As a new \"local\", this will definitely be one of our go-to places.  Next time we will order the crispy pork belly, sushi and of course the caprese salad and kimchi.  Thank you to Emily Huang and her team for making our first time to Pier 215 such a great experience.

For the non-seafood eaters, there's a section of pure land protein like chicken and beef. They also offer a great list of appetizers/tapas.   FOOD/QUALITY: I ordered the soft crab roll, an oyster, one order of salmon sashimi, and pickles. My friend ordered the bacon wrapped asparagus and shrimp tempura. We loved every single dish! The seafood is fresh and the dishes are nicely flavored.   PRICES:  The roll $9, oyster $2, salmon sashimi $2, pickles $4, two orders of bacon wrapped asparagus $5, shrimp tempura $4. With a beer, our bill came out to about $40 before tip. You can definitely have an intimidate seafood/sushi date without putting a hole in your wallet.

    "text": "New restaurants near home are always a welcome sight, especially one as pretty as Pier 215.  With all the new housing developments coming up in this general area, and Ikea just across the way, I hope this is just the tip of a very delicious iceberg.      We eschewed anything resembling sushi; nothing new being brought to the table as far as that goes.  Since there are other decent options for raw fish just a couple of miles away in multiple directions, $22 for a nigiri dinner didn't feel like money well spent or stomach real estate worth occupying.  The \"Asian Style Bouillabaisse\" featured an assortment of seafood cooked in a lobster gochujang miso broth.  The combined flavors from the mussels, clams, mushrooms and shrimp made for a really nice soup that I'd gladly pay for as a straight up beverage on a cold day.  I also wouldn't have minded an upsell to have actual lobster added into the pot as that would have made it even better.  Lobster makes people happy.  To prove this, I will attempt to throw cold chunks of lobster meat at the next crying child I see.  They should perk up instantly.                  Miso glazed salmon steak (menu said galzed, which could possibly be a trendy new cooking method I'm not familiar with :) was a hit for the both of us.  The well seasoned, almost candied outside of the fish had me ready to hail our friendly waiter down for a second order upon my first bite.  The bed of brown rice risotto it laid upon was an excellent accompaniment.  I would have preferred a lesser cooked center which would have made for more juiciness, but it was still a very well done dish.         They did a really great job with the design and ambiance of the space.  The big panoramic windows really make the whole room.  I'll be sure to make a reservation next time to ensure a table by them.  It's yet another Asian-y restaurant to add to the ever-expanding rotation of quality spots in this vicinity.",

Brand new building. Clean and very nice restaurant. Elevated Windows all throughout that give great views of the mountains.   The staff is very attentive and friendly. Had two servers serve us at the same time which was great.  The price on the dishes a still a little high for what you get in size and meat.  We order a few dishes off the happy hour. The spicy pork quesadilla, rock shrimp, ceviche, spicy tuna with crispy rice. All the dishes were good and had great flavor.  We ordered:  Seaweed salad - really good  Black Tiger roll - Really good  Surf and Turf roll - My favorite  BLT Roll - very good flavor  Hawaiian Breeze - Really good  Beef Tatiki roll - Not good - skimmed meat! No fish!  Seared Tuna- ok  Lobster Madness - Way too much rice!!   Nutella Crunch - Bomb!  Sundae - Ok  Overall -  a much better experience. Good flavor on all the dishes. However, I still think the prices are crazy high for the dishes. Especially the sushi rolls. Some of those rolls had all Rice and no meat.",

Our party of three was seated promptly and we had Ben as our server.  Ben is a very exuberant and friendly waiter who went over the entire menu with us from start to finish.  He can also discuss football with you if you'd like.    We shared: -Crispy Pork Belly -Rock Shrimp Walnut Salad -Teriyaki Tsukune (beef and pork meatball on skewers) -Pier Spring Roll  This was a nice selection for us to share.  I really enjoyed everything except the Teriyaki Tsukune which was nothing too exciting.   Pier 215 is not strictly sushi, even though it may seem like it at first glance.  There are several tapas dishes as well as specialties that include Chicken Katsu, steaks, pasta, a New England style Lobster Roll, and Braised Beef Short Rib.  I look forward to more visits to try some of these items.  Bring a friend or two because the more people who show up, the more food you can eat.",

You pay about as much for one piece as you do two at some other places, so it's not like you're getting an incredibly good deal, but the quality is there. The green tea creme brule dessert is also worth getting. Don't come super hungry or you'll spend a fortune. The service is professional.",

Since we had a large party I was able to try a little bit of everything on the menu and it did not disappoint. My main course was the miso glazed salmon risotto and it is amazing! It does not get too greasy and had just enough cheese to make you devour the entire dish. I also tried the pork belly sampler and again grade A item. The seafood ythere; live or cooked were fresh and great quality. All of the servers were informative with their fushion dishes and took the time to explain each item to us.",

Then we ordered the rest of our food: fried pork belly appetizer, chicken Katsu with a side of onion rings, and short ribs.   After waiting 20 minutes... The onion rings came out (starting to get annoyed). Then a random server comes out and says they're out of pork belly (still no oysters). I told him were done. (So they were out of 1/2 the oyster, some of the entrees, and the pork belly- on a Saturday night)   We stopped to pay for our drinks, and they tried to explain that the reason the service was so bad, was because the oysters take a long time (seriously, you crack them open and put them on ice), I should've explained to the manager the principles of supply management, because he clearly can't read a spreadsheet (otherwise he would've ordered enough oysters and pork belly).   Too bad, I really wanted to like this place.",

Multiple times.  - Food came out excruciatingly slow - Cooked items (tapas) were creative, but underseasoned  Sam, the manager, was nice and provided complimentary items for the wait. They are trying and should be an asset to the south side once they get their food and service in line. C'mon guys, rooting for you to succeed!",

This place has all of the trappings to be exceptional but is held back by a few strong factors regarding the menu and food. The menu, generally, is a touch overpriced despite many attractive offerings. The garlic chili edamame is very very good but the portion is simply far too small to justify the price. The rock shrimp appetizer is conceptually interesting but underwhelming because of too much batter, hiding, whether intended or not, the shrimp themselves. Further, the dish is topped with dried cherries that are clearly out of a supermarket bag. I suppose I would need to make more trips to have an informed opinion on the sashimi and sushi, but, in a city chalk full of exceptional and wide-ranging options in this arena, I would suspect they should invest in higher quality source ingredients because they seemed on par with good quality AYCE establishments - which this place is definitely not. Probably a good place for casual lunch to sample a roll or two or a sashimi offering, but you'd be better served to look elsewhere for higher quality offerings for the same prices.",

It came with 4 pieces, nice thick and juicy pork belly bites and was paired with a yummy sauce!  For our entrees, I had the seafood bouillabaisse. The \"soup\" to it was amazing. It had mussels, crab, shrimp, clams. Ahh. So so good. I loved every bite of it. I also ordered a side of kimchi and for 3 dollars, it was a good amount. My boyfriend had the Korean short rib with fried rice. Everything was so tasteful, from each little potato to the mushrooms, to the tender short ribs. The fried rice was good too, seasoned so well with lots of veggies.  And to top it off, their birthday dessert (balsamic strawberry macaron sundae) was ended the dinner fantastically.   The best part? 5 minutes away from the house.",

Right now, it's the best crispy pork belly in the city. A delicious, savory crust surrounding juicy, oversize nuggets of porcine perfection garnished with micro cilantro and resting in a shallow pool of sauce. I'd hurt someone if they took this dish away. Sushi is fresh, solid rice, high-quality wasabi and ginger. As we try more dishes, we'll post updates. Staff is extremely friendly, service efficient. Great natural light and cleverly placed internal lighting opens up the dark wooden decor.  Great neighborhood sushi spot on a mission to make a big name for itself.",

It wasn't that it was flavorless, it was just unmemorable. The 2nd time we went during lunch. I had their sushi lunch special. That was a mistake. I was expecting fresh yummy assortment of sushi, but the fish was subpar. It seemed as if it were leftover fish from days before, which it probably was.  I spoke to my friends, who love Pier 215, what I should order. I thought maybe I'm ordering the wrong items. They all said, \"Order the Premium Sashimi Platter. It has Toro, Uni, Foie, Ama Ebi, etc.\" So, my husband and I went a 3rd time and ordered the Premium Sashimi Platter 32 pieces. I thought this will be the game changer. The Premium Sashimi Platter is going to change our outlook on Pier 215. NOPE! It was a disappointment. We didn't receive Toro and the assortment of sashimi was unimpressive. As I said before, it seemed as if the fish were leftovers from the days before. The color of the fish wasn't bright and the tuna was slightly brown.  The service was great and everyone there are very friendly. I just wish our experiences were better.",

It was beautiful and had a hipster vibe to it. It wasn't busy during lunch so my bf and I were seated really quickly.  We ordered the crispy pork belly and both of us had the lunch combination beef teriyaki.  Crispy pork belly: absolutely HEAVENLY! It was just the right amount of crispy and the fat melted in your mouth. The sauce that comes with it was the cherry on top, as it added a really nice flavor.  Beef teriyaki combo: the lunch combo came with miso soup, tempura, and a salad. Everything was to die for. Each dish had it's own unique flavor that suited everything else beautifully. The portion sizes were perfect too, just enough to fill you up without overdoing it with leftovers.  I will absolutely come back again!",

Overall the space is clean and functional.  I love the \"seaside pier\" theme in the middle of the desert! haha.  If you are lucky enough to sit by the windows, you might catch a glimpse of the strip far away ;)  Food quality was solid. They have oysters and different sushi options, but also have some random western mixes in there! For example, their Katsu Fish Alfredo....what? it sounds super weird, but is oddly delicious! And makes for good leftovers.  The fish is fresh and portions are good. Ordered the Lotus roll which sounded and looked more impressive than it tasted (bland in my opinion).  The sushi chef carving the cucumber for this roll was kind of mesmerizing though! Also ordered red velvet cake for dessert which was only OK.   Service was very good.  The hostess was friendly and quick, and our server, while excessively excited, was also friendly and efficient. He was very good about explaining the menu.   Not the best new restaurant in town, but I would definitely return! Especially with people who like fish :)",

But when you walk in, you can tell that it's more upscale than a regular AYCE sushi place. Initially, I was kind of upset that they didn't have an AYCE menu since that's what I'm used to, but that quickly went away once the food arrived at the table.   Between my date and I, we ordered three traditional rolls- tuna, spicy tuna, and salmon- the spicy garlic edamame, the kimchi fried rice, and the Hawaiian Breeze roll. Everything tasted amazing, and they have the freshest fish that I've ever had here in Vegas. We also ordered the fried cheesecake, and that was such a perfect way to finish our meal.   The atmosphere was super inviting, the food was incredible, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.",

Have gone to many off strip, non-ayce sushi places and always found myself coming back here for sushi  I completely don't understand these negative reviews, they're def generous on the fish cuts for the price you pay. I have gone to different izakaya places on spring mountain who seem to be known for their \"sushi\" yet they provide you with that inch fish cuts.. disappointing. I also appreciate how their menu is varied and was mixed along with American and Italian. Where else can you get a nice perfectly seared steak to go along with your sushi? They've also got different specials going on with alcohol which most sushi places don't have :( I always love to pair my sushi with sake when I'm in the mood. PS. These photos are a compilation of different times I have gone in. The last time I was in a couple days ago, I believe they've set out a new limited summer special! Also, not pictured is their Nutella Crunch Cake. If you're here, get it! Trust me.",

    "text": "A food court offering Japanese, Korean, AYCE sushi bar style Americanized food with Vegas flair.  Huh?  Then again, what's offered is done well enough to please most.  A great thing in such a multi-ethnic city.  Keeping it real, sushi is AYCE joint quality.  OK ingredients, average quality short grain rice.  Vegas style rolls pack ingredients and over the top flavors.  Pass unless you're into that.  There are more interesting things to try.  Great raw bar.  On a recent visit, four kinds of live oysters including the Kushi, a personal favorite (small, plump, clean oceanic brine with the unmistakable finish of cucumbers), lobster, snow crab, king crab, and jumbo shrimp.  Typical shooters, oyster and uni shooters with quail egg and ponzu. Both fresh and as expected.  Do NOT add sake to the shooter.  Quail egg yolk and sake; you've been warned.  Finally, a good octopus carpaccio that captures the essence of the sea with the addition of yuzu, soy, and truffle oil.  The standout \"tapa\" is the crispy pork belly in kochujang, miso, and balsamic soy.  The pork is first sous vide,  releasing its oily fat leaving behind a moist, tender porky morsel, then its skin crisped to a golden brown cracklin.  The sauce brings out the sweetness. Good eats.  Great alongside a plate of grilled and blistered shishito peppers.    Sadly, the crispy soft shell crab wasn't crispy and the shrimp tempura, more coating that actual shrimp.  Better examples elsewhere.  From the $hits and giggles section AKA \"specialties thrown in just because \":  lobster rolls and fish & chips alongside chicken katsu and fettuccine.   Props to the bouillabaisse; clams, mussels, fish, etc in a lobster and dashi based kochujang miso broth.  Seafood slightly overcooked but good flavor ending with gentle fermented notes.  The miso glazed salmon steak, properly cooked with a sweet, salty, miso, sake glaze, correct.   Good, friendly off Strip service.    Putting it in perspective, it's not Yonaka Modern nor Izakaya Go.  It isn't fusion rather straddles the line between Asian and American offering something for everyone including those who feel Goyomon is da bomb.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I have to update my review on this place to a 1 star.  For a fine dining establishment I was very disappointed in both the owner and our meal.  The first time I came here was really good so I expected to bring some friends here to share my experience instead of embarrassment and disgust.  We ordered fresh oysters, the ceviche, a couple rolls, the kimchee fried rice, grilled salmon, and sashimi salad. When our orders first came out we all started to snapchat our beautifully garnished meals, and as soon as one of my friends picked up an oyster I had to stop him.  Why?? Because I saw an aquatic worm swimming around in it!!! It was disgusting and made our entire meal feel kinda scary to touch. When we told our waiter he went back to the owner and they all had a good laugh at our disgust, later he came over and apologized and said its because their oysters are fresh.  What a horrible excuse. I don't tell people e. Coli is normal for fresh chicken, how ignorant. Did he try to make any amend for the worm? No. He said he could bring out new oysters or let us order something else.  He didn't offer to compensate anything, or even offer a discount or nothing. Wow. It sure didn't feel like he was he owner, just felt like he was cheap and wanted us to spend more on worms and stomach problems..   I have to give this place 1 stars from my previous 4 star recommendation, I don't think I will ever return or recommend here again other than to warn others about the first live worm I ever found in a fine dining restaurant.  I'll stick to other mama or sf for fresh oysters, worm free.  No thank you pier 215. I regret giving you guys a 17% tip that day, I felt I was tipping the worm.. Worst fine dining experience ever.. Sorry",

Pier 215 came highly recommended by a work colleague.  The food and service did not disappoint!  Sashimi was amazing; fresh and presented as if I were on my private tropical island! The fusion cocktails are not to be missed. We'll be back - MANY times, I'm sure!  Our server Gene fawned over our every need.  A superb dinning experience.",

    "text": "This place is unlike any other Asian/seafood restaurant in Vegas.  The ambience is urban yet peaceful, the decor isn't flashy like many of the Strip and it's intimate but also inviting so my girlfriend and I really enjoyed the vibe as soon as we stepped in for our reservation.    We ordered the sweet garlic chili edamame (really upped the flavor of what is usually bland edamame), seaweed salad (the dressing was way too salty, but the seaweed was awesome), clam miso soup (sand in the broth, please clean the clams better!) and their popular Asian bouillabaisse.  The bouillabaisse was out of this world!  Neither of us have had bouillabaisse before and it was delicious.  She loved the mussels while the scallops were my favorite.  The broth wasn't heavy but packed with flavor.  Highly suggest you order this if you visit Pier 215.  The only thing that prevents this from being a 5 star review are the small nit-picky qualms from our food and that the service was kinda slow considering we came in and it was pretty empty.    I also saw something interesting when we left; we saw the owner step outside and take a long look at the exterior of his restaurant.  It's not very eye-catching and you can miss the place if you're not watchful.  To me, that says that he's very attentive of Pier 215's look and what can be done to improve.  I really appreciate that as this place has a ton of potential and they are off to a strong start in achieving that.",

Made a reservation through Yelp thinking this place would be packed since it's hot new business on Yelp, plus Daisy Carnival weekends. When I got here, I saw a lot of open tables. I guess I didn't need the reservation but it's better to be safe than sorry.  Octopus carpaccio... Delicious ponzu and olive oil flavor. It was gone in 5 seconds between two of us.  Shrimp scallop tobanyaki... Perfect. The scallops were very tender. Melted in my mouth. Came with shimeji mushroom an asparagus.   Hamachi kama... I've never seen hamachi kama this huge in my life. Two big pieces of kama. It was in tapas menu so I was thinking smaller portion. This is a meal itself. I know it's previously frozen, but tasted super fresh.   Kusshi oysters... Very fresh and sweet! The best oysters I've had in Vegas! I liked the wasabi salsa. I would've liked to try all the four sauces...  Sushi and rainbow rolls... Sorry but just like you would get in any AYCE place in town. I've had better sushi in AYCE. Nothing special. Rice tasted OK to me, just regular sushi rice with vinegar. Why can't they make my sushi with brown rice? They have brown rice on the menu. \"I LOVE SUSHI\" in Anthem makes brown rice sushi. They could've cut the fish a little more thicker...   Everything else was perfect!! The service was excellent!! Definitely coming back for their super fresh oysters and huge hamachi kama!!",

The atmosphere was comfortable and elegant with dark wood punctuated with ivory upholstered chairs strategically set up along the windows.  Since it was early in the evening, the shade were, thankfully, drawn. My friend and I both got \"the confused one\" cocktail...lovely and refreshing on a warm summer night....the four stars is because the were out of peach puree so all cocktails including it were unavailable.  Our cocktail had a blend of pineapple juice with apple sake and a hint of mint...absolutely refreshing and not too sweet!! We got 4 different sushi rolls, fried rice with egg, and sweet and sour chicken wings....not knowing portion sizes, we told our server that this was \"to start\"...everything was absolutely perfect and delicious!!  portion sizes were HUGE!!  we couldn't finish all we had ordered and turned down our opportunity for dessert because we were so full!! Serrano Tuna Roll, Crunchy Roll, BLT Roll, and 215 Roll were all delicious - fried rice was absolutely the best I've had in Las Vegas - full of flavor and moist!!  Chicken wings were glazed in a sweet and spicy sauce, sprinkled with peanuts and a bit of green onion...served piping hot, fried crisp without any batter or breading, just delicious!! I will be certain to visit again - maybe trying some of the Italian dinner choices and maybe having sushi again - I just know I will be back!!!!",

All of the items were decent the salad was pretty good the calamari was good also. The service from the waiter could have been alot better disappointing considering the waitress at the other table was soo much better checked on the table numerous time while we hardly saw ours.

The top of it was not torched to create the sugar crust that makes creme brulee so good. $7 error for store bought creme brulee that they didn't even torch in house is just lazy. Will I be back? Absolutely. Put please read this review and make your desserts in house.",

We left all of the decisions up to our server, Naomi.  Just asked her to pick out their signature items and bring 'em on out.  She  did a phenomenal job.  Flying fish, Toro tartare, Salmon belly, Chutoro Carpaccio, Miso soup, Uni risotto, Crispy pork belly, and finished off with the Nutella cake.  Oh, and a shout out to Naomi's husband - the mixologist working that night - you MUST get the 215 Whiskey Sour.  Fantastic!  They serve beer, wine, sake and spirits.  You can ask for a cocktail of your choice as there is no cocktail menu.  Love that this place is off the strip.  Great location for locals.  Strip center parking.  Corner unit.  Awesome pricing for the quality you are getting.  Place is hip, trendy, casual but put a little effort into looking good, it's not Red Robin for pete's sake.  We will be back again and again and we will ask for Naomi every time.",

I also tried tempura which my friend ordered in deluxe combination from lunch menu. Tempura was very crispy with just right amount of coating of flour.  The servers were very attentive, friendly and helpful with menu if you weren't sure what to order (because it's a lot to choose from), and even owner chef, Ted comes out to greet. Making me feel special :)  The ambiance here is great for a cocktail after work or a party with friends or romantic dinner! Very \"pier\" like decor and color scheme take me right to the ocean.

We had the miso soup, sushi sampler, Japanese pickles and beef teriyaki bowl. Everything was delicious-  each sushi piece was prepared slightly differently to bring out the flavor in that fish.  Also highly suggest the Japanese pickles which were all very different and looked like a rainbow on a plate. My only critique is the rice was not sticky enough. Other that that awesome new spot - give the a try.",

    "text": "I had the highest of hopes to eat here due to a recommendation. Sadly I have to rate it 3 stars for the following reasons:  The outside signage is nice and big and... even reminds me of something I would see in Southern California off the beach. Love that vibe!  However, when you look at the door area, it appears closed.  Luckily my friend had already warned me of this.  The Hostess was welcoming and friendly. Sweet with a smile on her face. Nice!  Server was friendly as well, happy to serve us!    Restaurant decor was cool!  Very hip and fun!  What was not fun was those middle dangling lights flickering and blinking!  Fail!   Food wise: So, so, soooo disappointing. Had high hopes and it felt like a Nobu wannabe. They kept dropping the Nobu name...like the Chef/Owner is from Nobu. Bottom line, you're not Nobu!!  I would go as far as to say the fish was bad. My scallop sashimi smelled.  From the moment our server dropped it off till it sat on our table...YUCK!  So fishy smelling and mushy. Nasty!  The taste of our Octopus Carpaccio did mimic the taste of sauce from Nobu, so we liked that, even if it was a copycat. The weird thing was the temperature of the fish.  Everything was room temperature.  Not used to this.  Usually fish has some slight chill to it.  Strange.    Based on this experience, we won't be making a special trip here or dining here again.  There are too many competitors out there with better quality food out there.",

We love the yellowtail carpaccio, garlic butter tuna, the grilled hamachi is my fave!!!! The tofu agadeshi is so good, the sashimi bowl and the 215 roll are good choices. Yes it's a little pricey but it's def worth it, the staff is always super friendly and they seem to have specials every day.",

The flavors were delicious and for a sushi house there wasn't the \"fishy\" smell or taste to any of the multiple dishes we sampled. The gyoza were some of the best I've had in a long time. Crispy, tender and delicious. Bonus, they have our favorite crispy rice tuna! For the experience and great food you would expect to see an expensive bill, but we were pleasantly surprised when the check came. The prices are on point for a local place.

Our first visit was a couple months ago and we have now been 2-3 times a week ever since!  Quality fish, excellent service by all of the hostess, waiters and waitress and Sam the manager always makes it a point to come around, say hello and thank us for coming in!  They have a great selection of beer, wine, sake and even a small bar with some select liquor in case you'd prefer to drink a cocktail! We are slowly trying new things every time we go but so far I'd have to recommend the Flaming Ahi Roll, it's delicious if you like a little spice, the Yellowtail Salsa is  also very flavorful if you enjoy sashimi and the Spicy Tuna with crispy rice is always one of my favorites! You can never go wrong with salmon and yellowtail sashimi either, the fish is soo fresh and you can taste the quality with every bite!  Of course the Otoro is always amazing as well!  I really can't find anything bad to say about this place and look forward to returning every week!!!!  Thanks for the amazing service and exceptional sushi Pier 215! We appreciate you guys and can't wait to be back!",

If you want great cuisine for a great price, get your butt over here! The GM told us about how he had an arsenal of chefs and boy did they deliver! The crispy pork belly is THE BOMB DOT COM BACKSLASH AWESOME!! If you appreciate a good piece of chashu/char siu, you will fall in love with theirs- hands down. We also had the sushi dinner, a side of shishito peppers, shrimp tempura, and a soft shell crab to munch on. Oh! Also, if you are a big tea drinker (like myself) they give you a whole pot of hot tea for 3 bucks and not just the usual cup! 10/10 would recommend!",

Will definitely visit again when we go back to Vegas.",

First thing we ordered were the oysters and from the first bite we had a idea that this was going to be a bad experience. Fresh oysters are a must and these were nothing but subpar. The ceviche was too fishy to eat. Ikira with quail egg wasn't great. After that we had a simple tuna and albacore sushi I took one bite of the tuna and that was it. If you are going to serve raw fish please make sure it is FRESH! We even asked the server to try to show him that we are not just saying that to eat for free he refused. When we send back the remainder of the food they still wanted to charge us. And then the cashier \"manager\" on duty told us she couldn't do anything she needed to call the owner. Where at that point the owner on the phone asked what gender were we. Strange ? Odd? Then proceeded to give us 15% off. YAY. Do not be fooled by the yelp reviews for this place. We came from the Belagio all the way here to have 4.5 star sushi and we got nothing better than a 1. Smh to this place!! Yelp should investigate these reviews or maybe these \"elite\" members have 0 experience with real sushi.",

I certainly want to give them the credit for their sense in  restaurant interior. We were seated right away by the hostess, and our server greeted us promtly. The service overall was on point.   However, their food did not meet my expectations at all. Their ceviche was not cold, and it did not have the classic flavor that I have had before. Their salmon skin salad was very bland. The server mentioned that the chefs were from Nobu. I did not see any quality of Nobu from this restaurant's menu. Maybe it's because I didn't try anything from their signature menu page, but I doubt I good they can be when the basics of a Japanese restaurant menu is not satisfying ( at least to me).   Their price is definitely a little above average from similar businesses around them. Their menu seems to overlap a lot with other local restaurants, but prices are more of strip restaurants. Will I come back? Not so sure, but might give them a try for their signature dish in the future for a second chance.",

The restaurant is really nice perfect for a date night. We came strictly for happy hour, I was very dissatisfied by the lack luster menu options they offered. For starters they only have discounted beer and wine which I don't care for either. So I had to knock a star for that. There weren't many food options which was a let down as well. There were no sushi rolls! How can a sushi spot not have any rolls on the happy hour menu? We ended up getting the garlic edemame which was amazing, raw oysters and shrimp which was pretty good. My friend ordered a crab crunch roll off the regular menu and it was mediocre to say the least. Lacked in flavor and super plain. From the pictures I've seen on yelp they seem to have other good options we just didn't get a chance to try them. The service was decent not good or bad. I'll come back another time to try the regular menu.",

    "text": "The food is spectacular. Presentation, quality, taste, and temperature... Practically perfect. Our main gripe? Service. The servers for the other tables seemed good though. It was just ours.  The place wasn't busy for an early Saturday evening. We had reservations for 6:30, but didn't need them. There were only a couple other parties seated when we entered. We were greeted and seated promptly and our server introduced herself.  She mentioned cocktail hour, so we ordered a whiskey sour. It only had a splash of whiskey. Turns out, it was NOT cocktail hour. Knowing this, I got the Blissful Sakura anyway because it sounded good. It was tasty, but only had a hint of sake. I'm a light weight and don't like the taste of alcohol... And I liked the drinks. They don't put much alcohol in them.  My selection of oysters arrived and they were delicious. Crisp and sweet.  We then waited 30 minutes for our entrees. Our server had forgotten our shared appetizer. That's a really long wait, especially when there aren't very many parties seated.  At this point, I discovered that they had specials. I heard about them from the server at the table behind us and they sounded great, but too late. I do wish our server had told us about them.  When our dinners arrived, we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed. The server for the table behind us had been explaining each dish while ours didn't, so I asked him about one of the sashimi selections on my plate because it was just so good. So much so that I ended up ordering another one of those a la carte. (Something something yellowtail, not the regular yellowtail, although I'm sure that's good, too. It's translucent white with pink edges. Very, VERY good.)  We opted to skip dessert and when the check came, it was incorrect.  We wanted to like the place. The food is worth coming for. We just got unlucky with the service.",

Once we found the place, it was a bit hard to distinguish if it was open or not due to the sun directly hitting the windows so we couldn't see any open sign or anyone coming in or out of the restaurant. Once we realized it was open, we were good to go.   Service was good. Cleared plates as soon as we were done. Drinks were brought out quickly. The sushi rolls were yummy. A bit pricey as they don't offer all you can eat.   Great view once nightfall hit. Can see the city lights. Romantic.   Would I come here again? Yes if I'm in the area. :)",

    "text": "No AYCE, which means you can expect good quality sushi-Come with those expectations because they will certainly be met! Everything that we had for dinner from the oysters, sushi rolls, kimchi inspired soup and the risotto, my words alone cannot do it justice so I will upload photos soon ;)  I can't write about Pier 215 without mentioning the interior. It's a perfect place for a small business dinner or date. From the moment you step inside there is dim lighting that is done by low hanging lightbulbs in the center of the dining room. The corners of the restaurant has neat decorations like a small lighthouse, baskets full of decor and more. The decorations really ties in the place together.  The oysters were smaller than the ones I'm used to but I can't stress enough about the freshness and quality. They were amazing and I'm not even a big oyster fan. My favorite by far was the salmon risotto. I was very impressed by the risotto and the sauce.  Like I said, it's all a la carte so don't expect a small penny for your meal. It'll cost you but in my opinion it's worth it. I just love the level of quality you can literally taste as opposed to regular ayce sushi. Will definitely visit again.",

I found a new place for my sashimi cravings. Went 2 days in a row, dinner for a birthday and the next day lunch because the platter for 5 people wasn't enough for me when I had to share it.  Fried Ebi heads were crunchy and tasty, Toro had caviar with truffle, and they also serve the platter with fresh wasabi.   Only negative I would say is dinner they forgot my hot tea, and the next day lunch they forgot my half dozen chefs choice oysters, I forget things too slow & busy times when I'm serving on the strip.  Sorry Soho I like Pier 215's sashimi platter better. Double the price but double the sashimi. Very fresh!",

    "text": "The atmosphere in the restaurant is excellent. Perfect place for a night out and the view is great. The menu, yelp and all these reviews definitely got our hopes up too high. For the price and the atmosphere we expected the food to live up to it. Items we ordered were the braised short ribs, the bouillabase, the baked crab roll, shrimp and walnut salad, hamachi kama, green tea creme brulee, and also the nutella crunch cake.  My husband always tends to gear towards braised short ribs any chance he gets. So if its on a menu he'd order it. Of all the braised  short rib dishes we have tried this definitely was our least favorite. The presentation is a little lacking and the meat was on the dry side. The flavor was decent and tasted like korean bbq. But I guess we were looking for that succulent fall off the bone short rib and it just wasnt what we expected at all.   Next we have the bouillabase... it was definitely not worth $27. Honestly it felt like some mixed seafood in a tomato soup. Presentation was a little lacking. I expected it to be a little more elegant. The flavors were fine but it didnt taste as special as I thought it would.   The baked crab roll was great! It was my favorite part of the meal! My only complaint is that once it arrived I could already tell it wasn't made with premium sushi rice(round and fluffy. It was really good but couldve been better.   The hamachi kama I dont really have any complaints. It was what I expected and what you would get at other places.  Walnut shrimp salad... the flavors were really good but it wasn't special.   Then came dessert and we really enjoyed both the creme brulee and the nutella crunch cake. The creme brulee was perfect but the nutella crunch cake I expected it to have more nutella flavor, still good though.   Overall... we had a really good time. Food was okay and service was spectacular.",

The interior is clean and is decorated with string lights. It's nice for a couple or group dinner bc you can share.   My favorites were the Japanese snapper carpaccio and hamachi Kama. The sauce in the carpaccio was delicious and the cuts were a good size. The hamachi was large and came with a great sauce as well. I'd definitely order both again. Other highlights were the yellowtail jalapeno salsa and Asian bouillabaisse. The bouillabaisse soup was a little sweet. I wish it was a little spicy but still really good. We also tried one of their sushi roll specials that came with a big avocado crab ball and some nigiri. I'd skip the sushi rolls and nigiri next time. Although they were decently priced, it was similar quality to all you can eat sushi places so might as well try other items. The o-toro was thin and probably the worst I've had in Las Vegas. It was chewy and not the texture that I'm used to.",

    "text": "Date night done right... Anyone looking for that special spot to take your significant other? Well look no further than Pier 215. I can't believe this place has been hidden off of Durango for two years, just under my nose.  The wife and I were researching on Yelp for a nice new sushi place we haven't tried yet and this won the search, after perusing the nice pictures fellow Yelpers added. We did see there were drink specials Sunday through Thursday in case a Happy Hour is in your future.  We began with some water and a couple signature cocktails: The Confused One and the Piers View both delicious and refreshing. To start we ordered the Yellowtail jalapeno salsa with micro cilantro and ponzu sauce 5/5. Great tasting even if you don't like raw fish.  Oysters seem to be calling the wife's name so we sampled a few of the Kumamoto oysters with horseradish, Tabasco and vinegar 5/5, very fresh. I had to try a few salmon nigiri which are always good. Then we tried the crunchy roll which was unique with the tiny crunch balls atop the delicious roll 5/5. Time for another signature cocktail, the Blissful Sakura, again very delicious. For the entree we shared the Pan Seared Scallop served atop brown rice risotto, very filling and prepared well 4/5 (would have been 5/5 but the last scallop was a bit sandy). The risk you take when enjoying shellfish.   For dessert, I thought we had enough room for two; so we ordered the Crispy Cheese Cake and the Nutella Crunch Cake. The deep fried cheesecake came out first and hit the ball out of the park! This was so good I wish we ordered two! A definite 5/5. The Nutella came shortly after and lacked the \"crunch\" in its name and tasted more like chocolate cake than Nutella (coming from Europe we LOVE Nutella). A miss on this one, stick to the deep fried goodness!  Sean was a great server, very attentive and made good suggestions. Will be back again, found a new date night spot.",

Throughout our meal, our drinks were quickly refilled without asking and he checked in on us often. The manager, Emily, stopped by our table to check on us and was sweet and engaging.  The food was fabulous and of a good assortment.  Price was a little high but we didn't mind because this was a special day for me. A must recommend!",

My husband and I celebrated our anniversary last night and the entire meal, I kept telling my husband, \"wow.. this food is delicious!\"  Our server (I apologize I didn't get his name) was absolutely knowledgeable of EVERYTHING. I told him I didn't want a sweet drink and he suggested a drink called \"Confused One\". I ordered it and it was not sweet at all.  My husband asked for a white wine suggestion, something that wasn't sweet but not dry either and Dr Loosen was suggested. It was a perfect pair to the seabass, which was also highly recommended.  Pier 215 is definitely a new favorite if ours and will definitely be back. Thanks for the spectacular wedding anniversary dinner!",

The happy hour rolls are all delicious with a nice mix of raw and cooked rolls for any in the group that prefer one to the other. The drinks are exquisite and quite affordable during happy hour.

Found this place on yelp and gave it a shot, will for sure come again as we had a wonderful experience   Parking- plenty  Kid friendly- they even had clean high chairs, and a special plate for the kids. No kids menu though but the chicken teriyaki was perfect for two kids to split.   THE FOOD- was seriously some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. We are Yellowtail Siracha roll, Crunchy roll and baked crab. All 3 were excellent! The miso soup was some of the best I've ever had. I also tried a bite of the kids door both the chicken teriyaki and fried zucchini were delicious too.",

    "text": "Service is friendly, but the price is too steep for food that can be hit-or-miss. Here's the lowdown ~   I RECOMMEND: -- Uni Nigiri. It looked great and tasted fresh. -- Rock Shrimp aka one of the best orders of honey walnut shrimp I've ever had. The batter was unbelievably light and crispy, the sauce was balanced, and the cranberries were a great addition.  I'D SKIP: -- Chu Toro. It looked sloppy and it was average quality. -- Beef Teriyaki Lunch Special. It comes with a lot, but it wasn't done well. Both the teriyaki and the salad dressing had too much of a raw onion flavor that was overpowering. The tempura was not much better. The batter was too heavy, while the vegetables had too much bite.  CLOSE RUNNER UPS: -- Clam Miso Soup with mushrooms. While good, I don't think the quality justified the price. -- Sashimi Rice Bowl Lunch Special. Presentation-wise, it was beautiful with the different colors of different fish, ikura, micro greens, and radish. Flavor was decent and fish quality was average.  Overall, this place was just okay. I expect better quality for the price, and the food here is too hit-or-miss to have me rushing back.",

I've tried so many sushi places that aren't AYCE because they're higher quality and this ended up being my favorite! Took my whole family here too and they agreed! They have the freshest sushi's that melt in your mouth with no fishy after taste at all!   I LOVE the yellowtail handroll! 5 bucks for that whole thing and everything else is pretty affordable! Their rolls are SO GOOD and so cheap! My family of 5 ate here and we were so full in the end and our bill came out to about 100 flat! That's less than if we had AYCE! Probably because the rolls are actually big and generous for the size!   They serve many other things too and their beef teriyaki bowl is SO GOOD! You can share it and it's only about 12 bucks! They serve good quality oysters and tapas as well. I'm really just wowed by the price range here for the quality of the food. It's too good!!!  The service here is also awesome! They're always so nice! It gets busy though so order up! The place looks great with the cute lights on the ceiling making if have like a Cali vibe in there!   I loveeeee this place so so so SO much! And I'm coming back next week ofcourse :)",

I tried the Japanese pickled vegetables.  Beautiful presentation.    Other than the slow service to get the food, the front of the house service was lovely.  The waiter was accommodating and friendly.  Two hostesses checked on us several times and lovely in conversational skills and very warm countenance.    The decor is lovely with little bits of humor to discover as you walk through.  The ambiance was spoiled with an obnoxious table behind us... but that certainly isn't the restaurant's really fault... other than if perhaps they would have seated us further away.

Be warned and leave early.   Once we got in we loved the look of the place. Dark and mellow and small. We were greeted by a friendly host and given a nice table by the  window. A review of the menu shows a lot of different choices, sushi to surf and turf to rice bowls. I wanted to peruse the menu so I ordered the garlic butter seared tuna ($14) and it was awesome. Perfectly seared tuna with a spicy sauce on them. Presentation was lovely. I followed that up with an oyster shooter ($5) which is an oyster and a quail egg in yuzu juice with some spices. Was very good and I downed it in one gulp. I then ordered an array of sushi, all the staples are represented, salmon, tuna, scallops, mackerel and yellowtail. All the fish was fresh and very tasty. Finally I ordered the miso glazed salmon ($24) with mushroom and onion brown rice risotto. The fish was cooked perfectly. Very tasty and glazed lightly with miso. I found a couple bones in my fish but it was very good. The risotto not so much. It was cooked well but had little flavor. Just bland. Could have used salt but there wasn't any on the table so I just ate it. My wife had the agedashi tofu ($6) and loved it. Very tasty she asked for a spoon to finish up all the broth. Next she had the crispy rice spicy tuna ($11) and it was very good. I ate a few pieces of it myself and it was good. Crispy rice and a nice spicy tuna. Not too spicy but enough. Then she had cucumber sunomono ($5 plus $3 for crab) with crab sticks and it was very good.   Overall a great meal and well worth the parking hassle. Service was good, friendly and helpful with any questions we had.",

My friend recommended it to me and we have been back once a week since then.  The fish is always fresh and the Toro is too die for. A few of my favorites are yellowtail salsa/carpaccio, crispy pork bellies, garlic butter seared tuna, beef tenderloin Tobanyaki, and of course the toro and sushi rolls they customize to our liking. They have a very diverse menu. For dessert you have to have the fried cheesecake with salted caramel ice cream! It's to do for! Emily, the manager goes above and beyond and aims to please. She can even put up with my boisterous husband lol. She makes sure everything is perfect and surprises us with new dishes to try.  The wait staff does a phenomenal job but Kevin is our favorite. His recommendations are spot on and really knows what he is doing. Both he and Emily have great personalities and do their jobs well. Give Pier 215 a try....you won't be disappointed!",

Their entire selection is decent (3-4 varieties) if you're adventurous but the happy hour is under the chef's discretion. I got to try 2 types last night and man did we have a great time with the BOGO beer and half off sake. Spicy tuna rice sushi and SPICY GARLIC EDAMAME were absolutely FIYAH.  The service is attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. We enjoyed the Asian male server who kept coming back to check on us and making sure we were good.  Spent $80 and I thought happy hour was supposed to be cheap! I enjoyed the place, atmosphere, service, food... And that kept me staying and paying!  5 stars for HAPPY HOUR!",

It was al dente and delightful but really rich and after a few bites it's a bit overwhelming. Crispy rice tuna was just as hood as Katsura in the SLS. Fish was fresh.",

Started with only a half a dozen and ended up ordering another 1/2 dozen before we closed the tab.  Cajun Shrimp vodka pasta was slightly on the salty side but that may be just a personal preference because I was the only one to notice. Hawaiian sushi roll was delicious. Garlic edamame was another great starter. Overall service was fantastic. Wish I had room to try dessert but we were stuffed and sated with everything else. Great place to watch  the sunset.

I kid you not the quality and presentation of the food is to die for. Absolutely amazing. After the appetizers we ordered Uni and the sashimi sampler. To tell you the sashimi was fresh and  tasty. After the sahimi we got braised beef short ribs, absolutely good. This restaurant is Japanese,Korean and Italian fusion restaurant. They did their homework on food and feel of a restaurant.

    "text": "My wife and I were looking to try someplace new to us and came across Pier 215 on Yelp.  We made reservations on the phone and when we arrived we were seated immediately. The hostess was warm and friendly as was our server.  We both felt our server was pleasant and accommodating but may have been lacking a bit as far as attentiveness goes.  We had to look for and call her over several times, but overall she was pleasant and what she lacked the rest of the staff more than made up for. I had the seafood Asian bouillabaisse and my wife had a sushi roll.  I really enjoyed the bouillabaisse.  My wife did not enjoy her sushi roll  She rated it just ok.  She also had a \"mule\" drink and wondered if any alcohol was in it.   Again, it was just okay. The shrimp tempura was a big miss. It was greasy to the point you could not even taste the shrimp. Oysters were okay, though several were on the small side and for $17 for a 1/2 dozen a bit pricey. Overall we rated the service good and the food just okay. But the kicker is that if I pay north of $100 for a meal ($20 for drinks) and it's not good, I'm not going back to try something different. Too pricey for mediocre food.  Not bad, not great, but not worth another try at that price point.",

Cool menu including sushi (but that's not the highlight), raw bar items, and special dishes (when we were there a squid risotto, kampachi carpaccio, and live sea scallop).  Cool selection of sakes from $6-70/bottle.  Cool deal with fair pricing: $3/piece sushi and ~$25/special.   Only lame part was the service. Our waiter seemed like he had never been a waiter before: couldn't explain the ordering to us, rarely checked in, and when I asked about the scallop dish he said \"it's you know....served....like a live sea scallop\"......???!!?  We definitely enjoyed our meal and I would be happy to return if in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "The big bonus of this spot is how close it is to home, especially when I feel there aren't that many great places in the SW. I like that it's nice, yet casual and really easy to just stop in and grab a bite to eat.  One dish that I've really honed in on is their Assorted Sashimi Rice Bowl (Lunch: $13, Dinner: $14). It's a large bowl of sushi rice (or brown rice for an additional $2) with an assortment of diced sashimi and other accompaniments. I've had it on my last three visits, however, the most recent bowl was disappointing since there were a lot more \"filler\" ingredients than seafood - there was Sunomono and another pickled vegetable and sadly, no salmon roe! Otherwise, I've really enjoyed them and the choice of sashimi. In the future, I'm going to inquire about the selection of ingredients prior to ordering to hopefully avoid a disappointing bowl.  Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna ($10): Soy sauce, scallion, and eel sauce. This is fantastic. There are so many crispy rice/spicy tuna dishes out there and so far, this is my favorite one. The rice is perfectly crispy with a nice interior texture and the spicy tuna is good. I also like the addition of the eel sauce as it doesn't overpower it.  Chicken Wings ($10): Sweet and Spicy Sauce or Garlic Soy Sauce. Good wings with a nice batter, plus, the sauces are delicious. They're really similar with a dominant garlic flavor and a nice spice, whereas the Sweet & Spicy have a touch more sweetness. We ordered the wings with the sauce on the side and were able to enjoy both sauces. However tasty, I wouldn't order this dish again is because it comes with FOUR small wings for an exorbitant price (It used to be priced at a more reasonable $7). Seriously though, $2/wing???  Crispy Softshell Crab ($9): Panko, lemon, tartar sauce, and honey mustard. The batter is perfect on this softshell crab; a really great preparation on a favorite.  Two Fifteen Roll ($21.50): Lobster, soft shell crab, asparagus, mango, micro cilantro, tuna, salmon, avocado, and den miso sauce. Really, really delicious specialty sushi roll. It's a bit pricey due to the ingredients (and obviously to continue the 215 theme), so it may be more of a special occasion thing, but highly recommended.  Pier Spring Roll ($11): Shrimp tempura, shrimp, crab stick, masago, spring mix, radish, cucumber, avocado, and red bell pepper in soy paper; sans rice. I really liked the flavors of this roll and enjoyed the fact that it didn't have rice. I also prefer this over their other low-carb option, the Lotus Roll, however, it appears they have recently removed the Pier Spring Roll off their menu. BOO.  Flaming Ahi Roll ($12): Seared tuna, spicy tuna, asparagus, sliced jalapeno, and garlic ponzu sauce. Not a roll I would likely order again, but it was tasty and had a good balance of heat.  I have mixed feelings about this place. I really do enjoy their Assorted Sashimi Rice Bowl and really the reason for my subsequent visits, however, I haven't loved my dining experiences. Also, their prices seem to be all over the place and that's a turnoff, especially when it's unexpected (like the chicken wings). I would definitely love to return, but the overall vibe makes me hesitant. Hopefully the next sashimi bowl will make me fall in love again.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place seeing the reviews and I thought at first maybe my expectations were set too high while in the midst of the train wreck but no. His place is just bad-bad. Not one bad but two bads. First it was my wife and my two small kids. We made a res on open table and sat pretty quickly and had a drink order taken pretty quickly. When drinks were brought we out in for our kids' food and an appetizer (chicken bowl and wings). Then we wait... about 20min later we had a couple people ask if we had our order taken, which we tell them no, and they went to go find a server. Finally the \"manager?\" Comes by to take our order and one of the severs take over. After we take our order we ask about the kids' meal and the app. Seems like hey forgot about both...  20min later we get part of our \"sushi\" (garlic/butter tuna and a roll). The\"tuna\" was just 6pcs tuna tataki with jap mayo sauce on it.  This was total lipstick on a pig. Dish was NOT a $14 dish and the roll was probably 4 total pcs of nigiri worth of fish... then 10-15min after the sushi dinner comes out. Such a let down THEN we get the kids' chicken  teriyaki bowl. (Insert Jackie Chan meme of WTF face). We then ask about the wings... and of course they say they're on the way. Mind you this place was MORE THAN HALF EMPTY when this train wreck was happening and a couple other tables next to us were getting orders placed and food deliver d before we ordered.   Review of the food. Sushi reminds me of end of the week sushi buffet fish. The sushi rice was overly sweet like you'd find at a Korean restaurant for Kim-Bap. Chicken wings still have feathers on them but that somehow justifies $10 for 5 wings. Do added feathers cost more? The salmon had the stringy sinew attached as did the \"sweet shrimp sushi\". I couldn't find a positive on this place especially given that yelp had 4.5 stars on it. I KNOW there are good sushi places around here. Makes me wonder who is dining here to rate it so high?  Gutter palettes?   Summary. This place reminds me of when Korean sushi owners opened terrible sushi restaurants in the 90's and cut every corner possible...",

I had sushi for the first time ever from another takeout restaurant and then from a grocery store and while those weren't bad, I wasn't blown away until I came to Pier 1. The fish, the rice, and other ingredients were fresh and bursting with delicious flavor.   We had the spicy tsunami roll, sunset roll, and ocean side roll. Our favorite was the tsunami roll which was spicy and delicious with a flavorful sauce. The ocean side and sunset rolls were very tasty as well. And we had the option to sub out the white rice for brown rice which we were very happy we did.   I would have taken a picture, but it was good, I couldn't stop eating, lol. Theresa was our server and she was great....very cheerful, sweet, and attentive. I could definitely see myself becoming a regular here.  :-)  P.S. If I could have one complaint, it's the music. It's young trendy lounge/nightclub music and I stopped listening to that when I was 25. I'd rather have relaxing music personally, but the food is so good, I'll have to overlook the music selection or bring headphones. :-p",

    "text": "I have been wanting to come to Pier 215 for awhile now, the place just looks pricey overall.. but we were so wrong!!! Came here on Sunday around 5pm for dinner and it wasn't crowded, the parking lot had lots of spaces. We got seated right away. The interior design gave \"the pier\" vibe and the service was very good! We ordered almost everything on the happy hour menu including the Tokyo Mule. I'm a mule girl and this was absolute magic. Who would've thought to make a Moscow mule with sake?! And let's not forget about the $1 oysters per PERSON! My other half is not a fan of oysters because they're always so fishy, but these ones were SO good he had no complaints. Will definitely be back again. This might just be our new weekly dinner spot",

    "text": "I've been hearing about Pier 215 since it first opened. I see it all the time when i go to EOS or go to Master Kim's. My friend had came up with this place after i spent all day to find a variety of stuff to suggest to her, and so we ended up here instead. LOL   Parking is always a pain here now due to how busy EOS always is and how popular Master Kim's is.   I was scheduled off at 5pm and she got off 1 hour earlier than normal so we could make it for happy hour, which was from 3-6pm daily  The restaurant is pretty nice, with lots of large windows along the edges of the restaurant. Originally we thought they were going to sit us window side but was instead in the middle, with a high divider.   The menu is small, containing only 13 items, but it was sufficient for the two of us.   Spicy Chicken Karaage - When i think karaage, i think bite size pieces of chicken deep fried topped with maybe a dry seasoning or has a side of some sort of dipping sauce. I guess it was the same idea here, except it was covered/drenched in this really sweet, mildly spicy sauce. It all sat on a bed of spring greens/lettuce.   Seafood Ceviche on belgian endive topped with avocado salsa - this was a bit depressing and not what i excepted either.   Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna, eel sauce, and avocado salsa - it has been a long time since we had crispy rice, and we had long forgotten where we had last had it at. My friend ordered this and i was happy because it was something we've wanted for a long time. Overall, it was decent. I think i may prefer a different \"fish\" instead of spicy tuna. Not because it was bad but a play on the textures. Crispy rice is crispy on the outside but its soft on the inside. If you put another soft item on top, it lacked a bit. Maybe omit the eel sauce. LOL (why is everything sweet?)  Chef's Choice Oysters w/ horseradish and cocktail sauce. This was surprisingly the \"best\" of the few things we got. During happy hour, there is a deal of 1/2 dozen oysters for $6, limited 1 order per person. Small little fat and plump oysters. Not too briny. Not too creamy. It was just, clean. Maybe a kushi? maybe kumamoto?   Ocean Side Roll containing spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber topped w/ seared albacore, fried onions, and ginger garlic sauce - Essentially a simple spicy tuna roll w/ avocado and cucumber topped w/ albacore. Decent tasting roll. Theres a similar one called \"Sunset\" which has crab stick inside instead of albacore on top. May try that next time !   Overall, twas a good dinner with my friend. Only downside is the happy hour ends at 6pm. We love going to Soho on Jones for their happy hour. This would be a good place for us to go to if we wanna switch it up.",

If you're really hungry I would say to try the Chefs Premium Tasting Menu- it's only $69 for 8 courses! And you'll get to try a little bit of everything.  Some of my favorite things on the menu are the Hamachi Kama and the Asian style bouillabaisse. I also love the hojicha ice cream here.",

We had wanted to go to the \"un-named\" Korean restaurant in the same parking lot but were unwilling to wait two hours for a table. This turned out great for us as we checked out Pier 215. We were seated immediately. The decor was fresh and elegant. As soon as we were seated our server immediately took out drink order. These drinks never went empty after that. Before I get to the food, let me continue about the service. Kevin was phenomenal. He was thorough, friendly, informative, and seemed to know when to be there and when not to be. We could have not asked for a better server or service. This alone would have brought me back.  The food was appealing both in flavor and aesthetics. The sushi was fresh, colorful, and full of flavor.  No restaurant is perfect and the only \"gripe\" that could be found was with the gyoza and even that was more preference than need. The Gyoza should to be crunchy on all sides. not fried on one and steamed on the other.   This was definitely added to our \"Go To\" list for the future.  BTW the unnamed Korean restaurant called us with a table being available after only a 10 minute wait. There loss and OUR gain!",

We drive by it about 5 times a week since out gym is Eos Fitness.       Started of with Uni shooters even though I usually would go for the oyster shooters.. They were alright to be honest more ponzu sauce then anything. We proceeded with an order of the Taco Carpaccio, it was such a great texture not chewy like other places in town.       Next my personal favorite roll was the Flaming Ahi Roll, this is straight fire pardon my slang terms. The tatake went especially well with the asparagus. For the main course we order the Sashimi Dinner! This really let's me know how good the sushi is at an establishment. My favorites that I got were red snapper, yellowtail, and the salmon. All the bites I took fell apart deliciously in my mouth.   Probably should not have ordered anything else but saw somebody order Bao Buns with Pork belly inside. Let's just say it was worth it. Pork was very juicy with a crisp to it and buns we're steamed well.   Overall great experience! Cannot wait to come back next time me and my girl are itching for sushi.",

    "text": "Pier 215 keeps it real the way that Carleton in his sweater vest has street cred. Still, I assume the folks in Rhodes Ranch love it!  My love and I stopped in without reservations on a Friday night just before the dinner rush. We enjoyed everything we had here. We were hoping to enjoy one of the tasting menus, but they were not able to accommodate a pescatarian request. I thought this was odd at a place known for their sushi and seafood dishes, but we made our own selections and proceeded on.   We started with a couple Oyster and Uni Shooters with shots of sake on the side. These shooters were enjoyable, but I'm not sure that I'd order them again. After these shooters we had a couple Sushi Samplers as well as their Japanese Snapper Carpaccio. While we enjoyed a few really great pieces of nigiri in the Sushi Sampler (Madai, Seared Salmon Belly, and Chu-Toro), I think my favorite dish was the Japanese Snapper Carpaccio. I'm a sucker for yuzu truffle soy sauce and the Madai they used was an excellent way to allow these flavors to really shine through with the lighter fish.    They are using some quality ingredients here at Pier 215, and I certainly don't mind paying for those quality items, but still, I had a hard time justifying the price of the meal. You can get the same quality of fish at other spots in town for a little bit cheaper, and while Pier 215 did a good job on their execution, I still wasn't entirely sold on expediting a return visit. It may seem small, but at a price point 12% - 17% less, I'd see us stopping by more often when we want something close to home. Either that, or turn up your game and really impress us with your inventiveness and execution. I'm sure they will stay open...and stay busy in fact, but in general, I'd rather venture elsewhere.   I was sharing my experience with a friend who agreed with my assessment, and stated, \"Yeah, it's great white people sushi.\" I nodded my head and felt like he summed up my experience rather succinctly. Great white people sushi is not a good or a bad thing, it just is what it is.",

    "text": "Went to an Oyster Bar on Sahara but the line was 40 minutes, searched Yelp and found Pier 215 which is within a few miles from my home. It had good reviews.   Sat at sushi bar, no wait, one other diner at the bar. It was Happy Hour. Ordered a large house Sake. It was ok, chilled, but not cloudy sweet which is my preference. 300ml for $9, not bad.   1/2 dozen oysters were a buck each. Ordered that. Limit of one per customer. I asked for crackers. Received lemons. Asked a different chef. He said they get \"asked all the time\" but don't have any.  I'd like to suggest, if you're being \"asked all the time,\"perhaps offering saltines or something similar would be really appreciated by your guests. Ordered about $60 of sushi. Asked chef after sushi arrived, do you have any wasabi and ginger? \"Of course.\" I guess it isn't served along with the sushi? I don't know. Service was less than stellar. I'm accustomed to great AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas on Spring Mountain and really high end gourmet sushi spots in LA. I'm not sure I'll return here. It's expensive, service is spotty, lots of Krab sticks in their rolls (can't stand fake crab), and had to ask for basic accompaniments. I did enjoy the 215 roll with micro greens and (surcharged fee) real crab.   Dining experience was about 1hr. Never asked if I'd enjoy more ginger, it was consumed when served, nor asked if I'd enjoy more wasabi--it was clearly empty. It's like the sushi bar guests are in a weird limbo, not much contact with the chefs and the numerous servers are always walking by quickly, most often avoiding eye contact.   Waiting for the bill, especially when a restaurant isn't busy, after a mediocre dining experience is such a pleasure.   Best parts of meal, watching the lacrosse and gymnastics championships at the bar on ESPN2! No sound but clear pic as well as the cold, fresh, tap water. They must be using a quality water filter because there's no hint of chlorine.",

We were seated quickly (we had 6:30 reservations but I'm not sure they were necessary. There were several open tables.).   Service was very friendly, but a bit slow at times.  We had to wait a bit to get water refills, and it seemed like we would never get our check at the end. After sitting for over 15 minutes with our empty dessert plate in front of us, we finally had to flag our waiter down to request our check.    The atmosphere was very classy and could be considered romantic.  Nicely lit and not too loud.  I ordered a signature drink... The Blushing Geisha.  It was yummy but not very strong.  I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, so it was either very smooth or very weak.      All of the food was fresh and the dishes were all good, but nothing WOW.  The menu was very unique and included some Italian dishes and even fish and chips.  We enjoyed the edamame and the Pier Roll the most. The crispy spicy tuna roll and the rock shrimp walnut were good but nothing spectacular, as was the dessert we ordered...the macaron sundae.    Overall it was a good meal at a nicely appointed space.  I will probably be back someday since it's in my neighborhood, but I won't be shouting it's praises to all my friends.",

So this place being close to my house and bookmarked for the longest time, I finally got to try this place out.   Order:  They were having 1/2 off summer special rolls. So, I ordered a few rolls off of that. The rolls were Tsunami roll, sunset roll and light house roll. All of them were delicious.   Rock Shrimp Walnut which was really good as well. The rock shrimp walnut was battered shrimp coated with a sweet mayo glaze with walnuts of course tossed in. A must try.   Chef's Sushi Special: consisted of 10 pieces of sushi and a tuna roll. Great quality and good as well. Also comes with miso soup!  Overall, the sushi is fresh and worth the price. A definite must try.",

Either way one entree was wrong and the other forgotten altogether. Ordered a Diet Coke and the hostess (not sure why she was helping the table when there was already a busser, server, and someone the server was training) brought something else. Got a ton of apologies but that's all. Ended up with half our party done by the time the other 2 entrees arrived.",

We weren't quite sure what it was going to be like and we were blown away. I'm not big on sushi, been taking baby steps, but my wife is. I had the chicken Katsu (first time). Great sauce, great sticky rice and the salad dressing was on point! Had a simple spicy crab roll that was also delicious and fulfilling . We also shared a Philadelphia roll with jalapeno-choice! My wife had the specialty baked crab roll...this thing stole the cake. It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Atmosphere is great for dates, and anyone really. Glad it's finally open. Our waiter Ben was very attentive. Sam (the GM) is dy-no-mite!!!! My wife also thought Sam was handsome. This place is a must try especially if you live in the Rhodes Ranch area. Enjoy!",

    "text": "So some friends of mine asked me to go and try Pier 215 with them. This establishment looked very intriguing based upon menu selection and Decour so I was excited to try it for the first time. My friends and I went for happy hour on Monday which is Industry night. Our luck the server we had was new and inexperienced on menu items. The server actually started off by saying that they are a Asian Italian Japanese infused cuisine. We basically tried everything on the happy hour menu. Most of our questions could not be answered by the server on the spot and the server had to check multiple times with the chef. For example the type of oysters provided and type of fish in ceviche. So let's start there. The ceviche was served on endive lettuce With a fresh mix of salmon , tuna and, octopus. Flavoring was prefect highly recommend this app! Chef's oysters although labeled as Blue points felt like was got Kumamoto because of the mild brininess. Didn't really care for the oysters due to the flavor. If you want something that will spark your appetite get the sweet garlic chili edamame. This edamame has some good flavor and isn't over powering. The California roll is not a standard thing I order but none the less it got ordered. So as for the California roll I've had better. The rice was under cooked and to large of a grain for sushi. The salmon was thinly slice all the other ingredients where large in portion, overall the roll was very bland. Spicy pork quesadilla The chef changed the pork out for my group to chicken seemed like the flavors would pair better with the pork - two slices this app seems small for the value. The beer battered cod was delicious perfectly fried and the cod was moist the french fries were also prepared perfectly. The fried zucchini had a nice Panko Breading on it I guess this is where the Italian influence comes in. Overall I don't think I'd visit here anytime soon due to multiple options in the area based on Japanese, Italian, or Asian cuisine. Specially if I had to pay normal dinner prices, so make sure if you were going to give this Pier 215 a shot go during happy hour.",

I could even say the quality and cool ambiance are better than any of the sushi places I've been to on the strip (probably all of them) and not overpriced as most strip locations are.   The hamachi yellowtail collar, torro sashimi and the BLT roll were recommended as well as the seared tuna on top of a spicy tuna roll which were all AMAZING.   Ben was our server and he gave us really good recommendations and is also super friendly and attentive. Sam, the GM was also really friendly and you can tell they are very knowledgeable on not only sushi but restaurants in general.  Definitely worth trying!",

Their fish selection is better than your normal ala carte sushi place but not extensive.   All I eat is nigiri sushi and or sashimi and from what I ate, the fish was above average but for ala carte it should be.  You order there by per piece and most of their nigiri is $2.50-5.00.  Of course the better stuff being 3.50-5.00 ish.   Surprisingly, the Maguro wasn't great.  But the rest of it was good, especially the kanpachi.

I forgot to mention an egg allergy, which is my fault.  However, they switched out one of my sashimi options once it was on the table and I noticed. Very accommodating, and again just wow on the sushi.  The crispy rice and spicy tuna tastes as good as nobu.  Yellowtail Serrano roll was amazing.  The only item I didn't enjoy in my previous visit was the macaroon dessert... only 1 macaroon and they covered the dessert in chocolate syrup... can't taste the subtlety of the macaroon when it's doused in chocolate.  However, it was minor and my husband liked the dessert anyway, so I am probably being too picky.  Highly recommend..: it's replaced our prior favorite as our new go to sushi spot.",

    "text": "So first let me start off by saying this place is FANTASTIC. I went last weekend with my mother (it was her birthday) and a good friend of ours went with. We had a beautiful table in the corner with the windows around us. We were sat and waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came up to ask for the drink order. So not a great start but whatever. We waited about another 10 minutes or more till we finally got our drinks. So long story short we waited and waited and waited for just about everything besides our main dishes after we had complained. Come to find out our waiter was new, it was his first day. So if we have known that from the beginning things would have gone much more smooth and understanding! My father has worked in fine dinning restaurants his whole life. So being his daughter and having my mother with me, we know what good service is vs. bad service. The food was amazing! Absolutely delicious! I highly recommend going to check this place out! The manager on staff that night was great, I can't remember her name but she took great care of us at the end. I don't like complaining but hopefully this helps just to make sure costumer service runs a little bit better. I will definitely come back and enjoy this place again!  If it's your first day anywhere let your costumers know ahead of time! They will be very understanding if things don't go perfect!",

They brought the food out lightening fast! So fast in fact that we nearly didn't have room on the table between the plates and glasses! The rolls were outstanding! The poke was great, although a little over priced. We ordered my daughter the teriyaki chicken bowl and it was huge! Completely worth the $8. The wait staff was amazing. They were polite, prompt, and really helpful. Odd compliment but the chairs are really comfortable. I hate eating dinner sitting in a chair that looks nice but sucks to spend an hour sitting on. Decor was really cute, and the view of the strip was perfect. Dinner was a little expensive for us to do on a regular basis, but we will be coming here again for date nights or special occasions!",

    "text": "YOU KNOW I LOVE ME SOME ASIAN FUSION (and cute restaurants)! I have to admit, the menu tends to overwhelm me a tad -- but the multiple genres of Japanese, Korean, American & Italian means that there's something for everyone here! This has grown to be a go-to GNO spot (since they offer a nice range of wines, beers sakes -- and a full bar!)... PRO TIP: Try to go around sunset & request a table with the view of the strip! It's also gorgeous at night. ;)   Dubbed a \"sushi seafood grill,\" the chef Ted Jung (previously from Caesar's Palace NOBU & Bellagio's YELLOWTAIL) has impressive food presentation. And while sushi connoisseurs will appreciate his traditional fish preparations, he also creates outstanding Americanized rolls as well! The extensive tapas portion on the menu is also Japanese dominant (I've heard recommendations for the hamachi kama, spicy tuna and kimchi fried rice).  Aside from the sushi/sashimi, there is also a \"Raw Bar\" section, soup & salads, and rice bowls. The main dish house specials are honestly extremely random, but a very interesting assortment nonetheless.  Ordered the following:  - BAKED CRAB ROLL: baked snow crab meat, shrimp, fried onion, avocado, cream cheese with soy wrap and creamy spicy sauce. (I highly recommend!) - ANGRY LOBSTER ROLL: spicy lobster mix, masago, cucumber, avocado, soy paper and creamy spicy sauce. (Not too spicy, very good as well) - SOFT SHELL CRAB: deep fried on top of sweet potato puree, served with a yummy dipping sauce - PARMESAN CREAM SAUCE FETTUCCINE: I requested shrimp instead of chicken or fish -- and was charged $3.00. (Very basic classic, nothing noteworthy but very big portioned!) - SHRIMP & SCALLOP TOBANYAKI: With assorted mushrooms and asparagus seared. (I would recommend ordering a side with this, smaller portioned but very good!) - KIMCHI FRIED RICE W/ PORK BELLY: (Good amount for a side!) - MACARON ICE CREAM SUNDAE: Choose two ice cream flavors & 3 macarons. (Perfect ending for the meal) - PEACH/LYCHEE SAKE: Served about 12 shots. (Paired very well with the food!)",

I do believe it was their off night.  The service was a little off.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Maybe 5-6 tables?  They took their time to seat us.  Slow process taking our order.  I ordered a shrimp pasta dish that was heavily salted.  It looked good though.    The other two friends who we came here with us the first time, told us  recently they came here for lunch a few times now and it's a lot better service.  We'll be coming for lunch soon.  Hopefully it will be better.  =)",

Portions can be small for some and price can be on the higher side, but you get what you pay for (maybe even more). We decided to go all out and order fried calamari legs, agedashi tofu, peppers, yellowtail jalapeno salsa, beef roll, oyster shooters and for entrees I got baked lobster tail with angus beef and my boyfriend got angus ribeye steak. Everything was great, the yellow tails was so buttery and melts in your mouth. The baked lobster was my favorite, goes great with lemon and butter.  Other than great food, the service was amazing and quick!! It took awhile for the entree to come out, but it was worth the wait. Our server BJ made sure we were okay and check up on us often. Love it here and will definitely be coming back. I wish I took better pictures, but we were so hungry I forgot",

    "text": "Talk about a nice little hidden gem. Pier 215 totally hits the mark although 300 plus reviews later that boat might have sailed. It was my first time so I was throughly impressed from the moment walked into the restaurant. I came with Ohana celebrate Christmas Day dinner together. If random star worthy just being open on Christmas Day deserves one. The last place anyone wants deal with is going out to dinner is anywhere on the strip. Sorry got off topic. Lol.  My brother made reservations although that night could have walked in be fine. The inside decor right off back really like. The whole vibe from the open kitchen, love all the wooden tables and chairs, little sushi bar area, and really feels like eating at high end fancy restaurant on the strip. Throw in some holiday spirit with christmas tree all decorated when you walk in. Awesome first impression.  The menu has a  really nice diversity. I really like the whole section for fresh oysters, They have nice deep selection believe saw ten different types that offered. Not sure if they are based on seasonal. We order half dozen of assorted ones. Forget the ones we got. Everyone tasted extremely fresh! The sauce compliment was unreal good! I love fresh oyster but living in the dessert really not lot of places trust ordering them period. The udon noodle soup caught me eye so got ordered for my own appetizer. It was actually bigger portion then I imagine. It between more entree size then cup or bowl size soup appetizer. The broth was AMAZING. Not too mention the udon noodles. The perfect way start menu with this winter weather. My entree got the Braised Beef Short Ribs. Talk about LOT of short ribs. I was little surprise because thinking the whole high end concept portion size usually tiny. So much meat actually had hard time finishing the whole dish. The sauce was super tasty, the meat most, and the roasted root vegetables was the bomb. Definitely dish would recommend. My brother and sister-in-law both ordered the bouillabaisse. The presentation was seriously artwork. Again I was shock at the portion size or the amount of shellfish in the bowl. It literally was packed. My nieces ordered the chicken katsu. Another great looking dish. We ordered couple different speciality rolls all on point. Not single dish not on point.   The prices overall close to fine dining. Some items not that bad but still lot more reasonable then going high end asian fusion restaurant on the strip. I guess two of the chefs came from Nobu so the presentations are all high end look but not the high end price. Just keep it real still not cheap place to dine but think about it steal of deal.   The service no doubt five stars. Our waiter was very engaging, friendly, stayed on top of everything, and us being first timers explained everything perfect along with some great recommendations.   Pier 215 will be back....",

And then you are either pleasantly surprised or just think..yep, I knew it. Well, this was a \"yep I knew it\" type of place. Nice presentation and good service can't hide the poor quality and execution. We had the 215 roll, which was very strange. Fruit and fish and strange sauce and asparagus, doesn't work at all. All the sashimi btw was stringy, not cut well, very thin and AYCE quality..including the Sushi dinner. I guess the clam and mushroom miso soup was pretty good, but there was no mushrooms, also strange.  Had a few other things that were ok. Gf said I liked the butter tuna, I don't remember, maybe, but just can't give do more than  than 2 stars.  I would skip this place.",

We got 6 oysters for $6! And they were soooo fresh and good. I haven't had fresh oysters in awhile. After that we ordered some salmon belly nigiri which was delicious *drool*   For our main courses we shared the shrimp and scallop tobanyaki and the Cajun shrimp penne vodka sauce.

They ask you what you don't like and work around it. Plate had standards you'd expect  (tuna, halibut, salmon, white tail) paired with more exotic pieces like squid, octopus, clam. Very good quality!  ROLLS: I had the Flaming Ahi Roll and the center spicy tuna was blended with a garlic ponzu sauce that gave it this amazing cream cheese like texture. Excellent.

Not only that, when we called the next day to inform them, the girl who answered took down our information and said somebody would call us back, but nobody did.   We weren't looking for compensation or anything like that, we just wanted to notify management because we don't want anybody else to endure the horrendous experience we felt.   We never even received an apology.   Will never go back.",

The unni shooter is definitely a must try...so melt in your mouth goodness.  I'm addicted to ikura and I was not disappointed.  I hate the too salty and unfresh versions, but these were so sweet and once they popped in my mouth, it was pure heaven.  I ordered the scallops with brown rice risotto and that was alright.  Scallops were amazingly sweet and cooked perfectly, but the brown rice was not that spectacular.  However this place deserves a 5 star just on the king crab legs itself.  WOW...just WOW.  This spot is a must try!  Adrian, our server, was so attentive and great with his recommendations.  Ask for him!",

He introduced himself and talked with us for a few minutes. His name is Sam. Very nice and polite. Made us feel welcome. Shortly after someone brought us water and then our server Ben came to the table. Asked if it was our first time. He was also nice and checked on us regularly.

Came here for dinner, did not know what to expect. Menu was kinda busy and scattered but every page was filled with deliciousness.    We started with the Oysters, so fresh so good, we had a dozen of the Japanese Kusshi Oysters, they also had the Kumomoto and BC's Fanny Bay Oysters. Our server let us try all 4 sauces they have for the Oysters, the ponzu was good the wasbi salsa was my favorite, however the Oysters tasted so fresh and buttery it was almost a sin to add anything else to them.   We then had an assortment of Sushi and Sashimi. The Yellowtail salsa Sashimi was melt in your mouth so damn good I recommend you get that dish. The rest was various types of Nigeri, all was good and fresh favourite of the Nigiri was the Chutoro.   Much more I want to and will try out here in the future. My only recommendation to management I can give, is please add an IPA to your Beer menu preferably a local one or at least the common Stone/lagunitas IPA. As summer approaches there's not many better pairings then Fresh shucked Oysters and an IPA on a Hot Summer day! Wish you all at Pier 215 much success! Welcome to the Neighbourhood! See ya soon",

Now for the food-varied menu of sushi, bowls, entrees, -mostly fish, sushi oriented. We stopped in for a snack/light lunch, but can't wait to go back for a relaxing dinner. Hubby had premier platter (not right name)-assorted sushi/sashimi and was delicious and so flavorful. I had spicey salmon roll, salmon nigiri and egg fried rice-all delish, fresh, well presented, nice flavors. Pricing very reasonable for the high end experience you receive. Attentive staff. Kind of hidden off Durango-end of strip mall behind bank and Cafe Rio. Try it-won't be disappointed and want to see this place do well. A new \"go to\" for us.",

So glad to have Pier 215 on the SW side of town.  This is our new favorite, for sure.  Can't wait to come back!  Naomi and team are FIVE STARS all around!",

Tonight was a different situation, the waitress yawning at 7:30pm at night while we were trying to order, then my husband order a second glass of wine, which is different from the first one, the waitress try to pour it in the wine glass that still has old wine in and I had to ask her for a different wine glass because it's a different wine! Then his miso salmon was brought out and it was over cooked and hard, and he didn't want to say anything but I made him tell the waitress and she brought another one out but was undercooked because I'm sure they rushed it! And when the final bill came the waitress charge me extra for something that I never got because they were out of! After this experience I would not go back, for the amount of money you spend there you can go to a better place for food and service!",

Pros: Food quality is magnificent. Food presentation was appealing. Establishment was clean. Employees were nice and professional.  Cons: Food was slow to be placed on the table. Quantity isn't a lot to get full on. Parking can be far during peak hours.  Overall, I'd eat here again. I enjoyed this restaurant. The pricing is decent, and the water is tasty. It's a great spot to eat with friends, family, or take a special someone out on a date. The interior decoration is astonishing.  Great job Pier 215!",

It was our first time here so our waiter went over the menu with us, pointing out dishes that are popular and also some of his favorites. We couldn't have asked for better service, it stayed that way throughout the entire meal. The food...... ah the food. Fresh, delicious, savory, enticing, tasty and simply gratifying. The presentation was spot on ( check out some pics I posted).  The jalapeno salsa that came with the oyster was so good we finished it with the edamame. The sashimi salad was enormous and each piece of fish was a nice thick cut. The penne Cajun shrimp in vodka sauce was decadent with just the right amount of heat. Even the regular salmon role was extremely fresh and flavorful. So glad we found this gem of a restaurant. We will definitely be back as the extensive menu is already calling our names.  Also snagged a free glass (for first time diners) on the way out. Awesome",

Since we had just gotten massages, we were dressed in jeans and t-shirts. I definitely felt a little under dressed for this restaurant, but the staff did not make a big deal out of it. We were quickly greeted, seated, and brought drinks. Our waiter told us about the sake special, but since neither of us had tried it before, we were hesitant to purchase any. Our waiter was nice enough to bring us some sake to try with our dinner.   I ordered the spicy tuna and avocado rice bowl, and my fiance ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. We each ordered two individual pieces of sushi, since he isn't really big on fish and just wanted to try some. I got the fresh eel, he got tuna, and we both got a yellowtail to try. It was absolutely delicious, just like everything else we ate!   Overall, I was extremely impressed with this restaurant, and it was a perfect way to end our night. Since it it so close to us I look forward to returning again and trying more of their food!",

But the last two times, it's been meh. Maybe 6.5 out of 10. A lot less flavor, kind of bland, and not as much broth. Heartbreaking!  The octopus carpaccio is still really good, that hasn't changed. And the Kim Chee fried rice is a tad on the sweet side, but also very good.  I've noticed a change in staff as well. We used to see the same faces when we came in, but the past two times it seemed like a lot of new staff. Not sure if this has anything to do with the fall of the Bouillabaisse, but whatever has caused this change, I hope it gets fixed and soon.",

Tried the following plates:  Chicken Wings - It's not your typical dive bar wings, it's cooked to crisp perfection with sweet and sour sauce. Flaming Ahi Roll - it's good but the name kinda lied to me. This roll is not spicy at all. Octopus Carpaccio - very fresh, and very delicious. It's like a beef carpaccio but octopus! Asian Style Bouillabaisse - there's some spicy-ness to it but do inhale the soup slowly. Delish!  Would definitely come back here and try out their raw menu.",

The beers are also buy one get one free during this time! I didn't find any of these appetizers especially good, but it can be because I'm not really into fried food too much.  The cod was fried really well though, the outside was a little oily, but it was crispy.  We really came here because I wanted to try the sashimi dinner, and that was really good! The fish here was really fresh and I enjoyed it.  Our server was really nice and attentive!",

The ambience and decor of the restaurant was really chill and I loved the music they played.  We were greeted by a host and our server was attentive as well. After looking at so many choices for sushi and other asian fusion dishes, we decided to try a few dishes from the Happy Hour menu. You can't go wrong with that.  I ordered sweet chili garlic edamame - really good, crispy rice with spicy tuna - rice wasn't too crunchy and just the perfect balance with the tuna, seafood ceviche, and two dozen oysters - very fresh. My partner also ordered the tokyo mule to drink and it was so good! Our waiter said they had some promotion going on so we were offered a free shot of tequila as well, but I decided to pass.  Overall, I had a great experience and will definitely return again. Next visit I'll be trying their sushi and other dishes :)",

Prior to making a reservation I sent them a message via Yelp and heard back from Krissy, the owner, in just a couple hours. I'm a Celiac and wanted to know if there were gluten free options. My husband is a HUGE sushi fan. We'd not been to sushi since December, because it's hard for me to find places that are helpful and safe. And I don't blame restaurants; it's a pain in the arse, I'm sure, to make accommodations for Celiacs. Krissy was amazing. She explained that they could make gluten free dishes. Also, she asked that I make a reservation and add in the gluten free info. Thanks Krissy!!  When we arrived we were seated a nice round table with a reserved sign. Kevin, our waiter, came over and greeted us. He was super friendly and really knowledgeable about the menu in regards to how to modify for gluten free dishes. He also knew about my needs from the reservation notes and I didn't need to explain myself - that was pretty darn amazing. If he was even slightly unsure of a dish and how to modify, he consulted the kitchen. I cannot say thank you enough for that, because typically waiters and waitresses guess. Naomi, the manager (and I'm 95% sure that's her name, my husband and I are pretty certain - my apologies if we've gotten her name wrong), also checked on us. She stopped by a couple times, topping off our sake, checking on food, and then to offer two glasses of complimentary plum wine at the conclusion of our meal.  Also, every single person that came to our table to bring food, top off water, or take plates were very friendly and professional. First class service every single step of the way.   Now, let's get to the food. My husband considers himself a sushi expert of sorts, given the amount of sushi he's consumed in his lifetime at several different restaurants in Vegas, Hawaii and Southern California. While he was eating the Pier Roll (a decadent baked roll), he said, \"This is the best roll I've ever had.\"  Kevin helped make the Pier Roll gluten free for me and I shared it with my hubbie. He said that the gluten free option was just as good. Every single thing we ate was delicious, fresh, and beautifully prepared. I highly recommend the Pier Roll and the snow crab sushi (literally melted in my mouth). The ceviche is delicate with small pieces of fish and octopus - so good! Kevin make a gluten free sauce for me that was delicious!    The interior is reminiscent of a coastal fish restaurant with extra class added in with the cream colored chairs, for example. There's dark wood and lights strung up, along with pictures of piers. It's very comfortable and fun.  If I could I give Pier 215 ten stars I would. We will be going back  A LOT and bringing friends with us next time.",

And there, in the corner, was Pier 215. We stepped in and had one of the best meals we had in Vegas. Seriously. This place has a perfect menu with many different options - but don't be mistaken: this is a serious sushi place. The fish here is extremely fresh. The various plates from the \"raw bar\" section of the menu are some of the best flavor combinations ever. The sashimi is perfectly prepared (and sliced just the right way; not too thick). On top of the food being top quality, the service here is fantastic. Everyone is very attentive, polite and just pleasant to deal with. This place is a neighborhood gem, perfect for families (I come here with my stroller) and date night. 5 stars in a z formation!",

Our waitress was very friendly and extremely attentive; we never had to wait long for drinks, condiments, or clearing of plates. Appetizers were awesome, especially the crispy pork belly. Our sushi rolls were also very well made, unique, and flavorful. Highly recommend the spicy tuna over crispy rice as well.  My only gripe was that the nigiri sushi was just mediocre. I ordered the salmon, red snapper, yellowtail, and chu-toro; the presentation was lovely but the taste was just ok. Nothing fishy or dry, just not particularly flavorful. Also found it odd that they did not include wasabi or ginger with the sushi. I guess maybe they were trying to go super authentic/classy and let the sushi stand on its own without any extra garnishes but the sushi was not \"wow\" enough for that in my opinion. At least ginger should've been provided as a between fish palette cleanser.   That being said, I would certainly visit Pier 215 again. Most of the dishes were great and I can't wait to try more of what's offered here. The front of house staff all had excellent attitudes and the service was better than I've had in some local fine dining establishments. Kudos to the management here for putting together a great team.",

I ordered the Sashimi lunch combo and my husband order a Sashimi Bowl. The fish doesn't taste that great either. Not sure if I will be visiting back here again. Besides from that the location is easy to find, the bathroom is clean but I must say the service is a little slow.",

I had the Sashimi Salad and it was delicious and somehow unexpected with regard to flavor combinations. Our waiter highly recommended desert and all I can say is the deep fried cheesecake is decadent and the green tea ice cream was the best I've ever had. In short, if you're considering eating out and you've never been here, look no further. Come to Pier 215.",

And can definitely see us coming back as regulars. More of a treat once in a while versus a once a week type restaurant. That's not a bad thing at all but be prepared to spend a few bucks if you go all out. Let's get to the food.   We ordered   Uni 3/5- plain nothing special wasn't as fresh as I wanted it to be.  Half dozen Kumamoto oysters and Half Kuushi oysters 5/5- I love oysters so these were a great treat and delicious and fresh loved the dipping sauces there was 4 that was offered all were great also a must order!!  Hamachi Kama 5/5- Loved that it was a very big portion that fed me and my wife as a very well prepared piece you yellowtail collar. Absolute must order for sure!   Black tiger roll 4/5- pretty tasty roll. Not something you've never had before but yummy!  Scallops and brown risotto 3.5/5- Scallops were delicious but risotto was not cooked to my liking I would like it a little softer texture rather than al-dente.  Seafood bouillabaisse 4/5- Really good broth in this I ordered some rice to eat with the broth poured all over. The seafood was good there was shrimp,lobster, crab, scallops,mussels,clams and mushrooms and bok choy. Would order again but would like more crab in this.   Big Thanks to Pier 215 and staff for the wonderful service and food. We really enjoyed the experience",

As we enter the restaurant, I couldn't help but feel intimidated by its gorgeous ambiance and upscale feel. Not being dressed properly for a fancy restaurant option I was actually afraid.   As the very friendly hostess sat us at a table and I glanced at the menu, I felt relieved. This to me was what I liked the most about this restaurant and will consider it a \"hidden gem\" if you would. It's very affordable. Every price here was reasonable and not outrageous like I expected from a place that looks this great.    We tried a variety of foods. The soups were delicious and flavorful, not bland like you get in a lot of places. The sushi I had here was certainly very well prepared and delicious. My friends had oysters and said they were good.   Overall it was a pleasant surprise to have a place that looks this good with affordable pricing. Will definitely return.",

    "text": "This is a late review. I've been to this restaurant twice as the first time I really enjoyed the lunch menu. We ordered the kimchee fried rice and short rib. The kimchee fried rice was delicious and very savory. The short rib was full of flavor as well. The ambiance in regards to decor is very nice and modern but the music threw me off during lunch hour. I felt that I was at a pool day club with the EDM music blasting. Lol. We enjoyed lunch so much that we decided to go back for dinner.  The dinner was a bit of a disappointment for me in one category and that was the lobster that I ordered. There was a sweet glaze to it that I felt overshadowed the natural sweet taste a fresh good lobster would have. I understand the desire to put a twist on a dish but for me it fell short. I had hoped the lobster would've been savory and not sweet. The sushi was fresh, simple and delicious. My boyfriend had the rib eye and it was tender and flavored well.  The staff has always been very friendly and provide excellent customer service. I do believe the first time we dined there the waitress mentioned that one of the chefs was a chef from Nobu's which made me excited to know that information especially if you're a foodie.  I wondered if they would be pumping the EDM at dinner and of course they stayed True to their music choice. This time it definitely set the mood to do some fist pumping on the strip after dinner.  The restaurant is a bit on the smaller side so make sure to make a reservation just in case on an anticipated busy night.",

We went to the restaurant expecting a lot more seeing that they boast that their chef is from Nobu but my opinion, just as it is important for the sushi to be good so does the whole experience...  I then had to get the attention of the hostess who was standing by the register chatting it away with whom looked like the owner to ask for a box and our check..a total of 3 times till I got my check processed..that I had to say loudly \"excuse me\" to the hostess multiple times..  Not to mention that the owner didn't even have the etiquette to come and apologize to us and walked right past our table..  Wasted 200 on a place with mediocre food,poor service, and lack of respect for their customers opinion..then hands us two free appetizer cards to us..won't be needing those...I will not be returning nor will I be recommending to anyone",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise! This restaurant is phenomenal. We were driving around close to where we live and decided to yelp areas around town and this restaurant had a high rating. We thought... Is it new?... We decided to try it. We are sure glad we did! To begin with, it isn't a very good location, right off Durango and the 215. Secondly, it is a very nice restaurant with a lovely ambience and very comfortable seating. It is relaxed and informal, with excellent service and prices that are more than reasonable. We started with the octopus carpaccio which was delicious, followed by the cucumber salad which was outstanding, and we also tried the mixed tempura made with vegetables and shrimp and it was quite yummy. We then ordered a yellowtail with scallion roll, toro with scallion roll, and a rainbow roll. All three were simply divine! They were so incredibly good that we were in disbelief that we have found such an incredible restaurant off the strip with such incredible sushi at such reasonable prices. Note that only two weeks ago we went to a restaurant at the MGM Grand Hotel, a Japanese/sushi restaurant with the name of a very iron famous chef, and this restaurant's sushi was so much better than the sushi at that restaurant and I am not kidding. We payed three times as much at that restaurant for sushi that was not half as good as that of Pier 215. We also tried the Pier 215 Roll which is a rainbow roll that is loaded up with way more ingredients including asparagus and mango and several more slices of fish added to it as well as softshell crab: it was pretty good! We did try a specialty warm plate which was the miso Salmon with risotto: it was not bad at all and really good for anyone that is not a sushi fan. It was really good.  To drink, we ordered the white peach Hana sake: wow... delicious! This is a wonderful restaurant, off the strip, with extremely good and high-quality food, with a lot of Japanese and Korean influence, and it was simply delicious. I highly recommend it to anyone and it beats pretty much any restaurant on the strip that wants to compete with this restaurant for great sushi. If I could, I would give this restaurant 10 stars! We are definitely going back! Note that we did go back a second time and it was just as good as the first time. This place is the bomb!",

My only small complaint was that the tempura was a bit oily, but the salad and soup was good and the bowl was tasty. Service was friendly, and tentative. And the location was clean and nicely decorated. With a number of lunch specials available i don't see why you wouldn't check it out. But i personally have not and likely will not try dinner because of the more than one review mentioning worms in the oysters, and how management handled it.",

The servers did their best to assist but definitely need more experience to be great.   On our visit, I ordered the deluxe chef special for $59. It consisted of a small salad, miso soup, ten pieces niigiri sushi and ten pieces sashimi. I received AYCE size and quality sushi and sashimi. That was disappointing.   My friend got the Anago bowl $18 and did like the cooked eel over rice. My wife had the seared scallops over risotto $28 and said her scallops were a little overcooked but still enjoyed it.   The happy hour specials we tried were the fish and chips (good), spicy quesadilla (okay) and the fried zucchini (okay).   Overall everything was okay but if I would have gone to an AYCE sushi place, I would have spent half for my meal for the same quality fish.",

    "text": "I passed by this place many times as it was being built and after finally seeing it open, I decided to drop in!  Atmosphere: Pier 215 did not disappoint. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very relaxed and welcoming. There is a slight breeze in the air that gives you the same chill youd get if you were actually on a pier by the ocean. Depending on where you're sitting, you also get a very decent strip view that adds to the welcoming feeling of the restaurant. Theres an open patio that isn't utilized yet, which gives the restaurant great potential for patio seating and adds more substance.   Food: incredible. I ordered a traditional chicken teriyaki Roll and the flavor was incredibly well balanced. The meal didn't feel heavy like youd get at other places who use thick cooking materials. We also ordered the Hawaiian breeze roll and the salmon was incredibly well cooked w/ pineapple topping that added amazing flavor. The green tea and passion fruit teas are very smooth even without sugar and have great flavor. The menu was also well organized. There may be a picture menu available on request for those who desire photo menus.   Customer service: definitely growing, but very acceptable. Given they've only been around for 2 weeks now, the customer service is going to feel those natural jitters and occasional growing points, but Max and the other staff handled everything perfectly with options, drink refills, and light conversation. After more time paases, I have no doubt that this place will have a great reputation for great service.   Price: very fair! Some items may seem a little overpriced at first, but given the moderate portion sizes and quality overall, the prices actually seem very very fair. Don't judge a book by its cover until you order.   Overall: 5/5 for sure. This place has amazing potential to be an amazing stop for the SW Las Vegas area and beyond. Furthermore, for writing this review (or any) the restaurant offers free Mochi dessert! For anything, come in for those too because they're so perfect with flavor.",

Food was delicious and service was great!  Very friendly welcome! Not only was the server great but the others that brought our food made further great recommendations and one of the other gentleman was talking sports to my son which was great!  My husband swears by the Lotus Roll, one of the best he's had! Perfect combo of taste & texture.  Hawaiian Breeze and Yellowtail Serrano Roll also very delicious.   Kids enjoyed their simple shrimp tempura, California roll and beef rice bowl so glad they have something for everyone. Kids were happy so I am happy!  Great new spot, will definitely be back with more friends and family! Good spot for family, date night or girls night!",

After more waiting, another waiter came and he was fine.  But I was ready to walk out and this beginning ruined a fine evening of dining.

He gave us a VIP treatment that made the night unforgettable. All his recommendations were spot-on. You can tell there is a lot of passion, heart, and soul that was put into creating Pier 215.   Ambiance: Right when you walk in, you're greeted by a very sweet hostess. The vibe is hip and fun. The place was busy on a Saturday night with large and small groups dining. The restaurant has an open kitchen concept is unique. You get to see the chef's cook in a clean kitchen (which is always a plus). There's also a sushi bar people can take advantage of. The service here was phenomenal! The staff does a phenomenal job at being mindful of the needs of each table.   Food: INCREDIBLE food. We had the following dishes:   Kim Chi Fried Rice: Must try and authentic made by a talented Korean Top Chef.  Pork Belly Appetizer - perfect balance of tender meat and juicy fat that's been cooked for 18+ hours.  Yellowtail Salsa: This dish is full of flavor and the fish just melts in your mouth.  Uni Shooter: Interesting experience. If you like Uni then try it with a shot of Sake. :-)  Sushi Dinner: Rice was impeccable. Fish was fresh and tasty. Excellent quality for the price!  Asian Style Bouillabaisse: Really enjoyed the taste of the soup mixed with the seafood.  Calamari appetizer: Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The dipping sauce really enhances the dish. Green tea, Plum Wine and Vanilla Ice Cream: Savory treat. The Plum wine was the best!   Price: It's reasonably priced for the quality of the food. There's two chef's that used to work at Nobu and Yellowtail. The food supply is also from there so if you want to enjoy a fine dining experience without breaking the bank, then this is your place!   Pier 215 is a must try. I highly recommend it! Be sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekends. :-)",

    "text": "Where to begin! Walking in we were greeted by Sam the GM of Pier 215 he's amazing! He sat down at the table and went over the entire menu with is highlighting a few items that make this restaurant special and boy was he spot on.      For starters we went with the octopus carpaccio (my absolute favorite) the truffle  oil was a nice touch and the octopus was extremely tender even better than milos octopus carpaccio. Next we tried the yellowtail jalapeno salsa but with kanpachi instead. The level of freshness of the seafood is commendable and it really shines though in flavor. We didn't go crazy with sauces to accompany our Kumamoto oysters but the wasabi salsa really stood out because like I said their freshness quality is a staple so of course it was fresh wasabi none of that generic powder so that was a plus.         Now on to the main dishes. The three of us each order an entree and shared a little because I have to try everything. Let's tart with the fettuccine Alfredo sign crispy white fish. Everything was seasoned perfectly the said was the perfect consistency and the fish was nicely crispy on the outside, most and tender on the outside. Definitely a rich dish so obviously on the heavy side perfect for sharing or a hearty meal. Next up I could resist the Asian style bouillabaisse with my love for all things French and Asian so this was right up my alley. I've read other reviews where maybe it wasn't enough seafood but my was jam packed with deliciousness there is definitely no skimping on quality seafood such as shrimp, crab, scallops, mussels & clams with just the perfect amount of mushrooms and bok Choy. When our server tried to clear the plates I wasn't ready to part with the broth once you get to the bottom every spoonful of broth is a jewel full of crab and other delights.      Last but not least was the kimchee fried rice let my start by saying the flavor was definitely there but I would have preferred nice cuts of pork belly on top with a fried egg but those are tedious observations. All in all the service is amazing definitely no quirks like most new business have. Sam is definitely an asset to the setting and the food as far as flavor and quality goes is superb. I definitely look forward to coming back and eating my way through the entire menu slowly but surely. Thanks to Pier 215 my gym membership will be put to use and all of my social media following will salivate over my continued foodie posts!",

Both the cooks and servers made great recommendations. Food portions are good for the prices. Seafood nachos and pork belly were awesome! Glad that I decided to come in, really enjoyed my dinner",

We mentioned that we were new to the area and she completely treated us to the neighborhood. Every interaction was sincere! I felt as if she went above and beyond to make our visit great. She helped us with the menu by showing and describing the popular plates. She offered this willingly and I thought that was so awesome. The restaurant is beautiful. Every table was set nicely and they have a wonderful romantic window view of the strip..... Now THE FOOD!!! Amazing! Kudos to the Chefs in the back; this was seriously all delicious! The Tapas: Crispy Pork Belly was so dang GOOD!!! I could have that every night. The 215 Roll was extremely good. The Dragon Roll was cooked beautifully. I am honestly in a better mood because of my visit. We will definitely be back soon. What a wonderful experience!",

    "text": "Just tried this place tonight. The restaurant was very clean and has nice decor and ambiance. We also enjoyed the music which was relaxing lay upbeat. As for the food we decided to try a couple rolls and tapas. We tried the pier 215 roll, since other reviews suggested it, and it was really good especially the mango which added a nice sweet perk. We also tried the lotus roll which was like a cucumber salad in roll form and I suggest that one as a must try. We also had the mixed tempura which was delicious with a light flaky batter and really flavorful sauce. Lastly we tried the calamari which my boyfriend enjoyed but we both agree it was very chewy. Our server didn't realize that it wasn't brought out earlier and we did get there later in the evening (10 pm) so I think maybe they rushed to cook it, not sure but the dipping sauce had a great taste to it. I'd give the calamari another try and will definitely add this place to my list of places to go.",
