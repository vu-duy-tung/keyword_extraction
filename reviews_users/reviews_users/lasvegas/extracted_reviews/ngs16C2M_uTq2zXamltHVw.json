    "text": "Jessie Rae's may be small, but the BBQ they produce packs a powerful punch. I considered knocking a star off due to how small this place is, but the flavor of the 'que coupled with the excellent service from the owner makes Jessie Rae's top notch   Jessie Rae's is an award winning BBQ spot that smokes the meats for 13 hours. They are also a rather new business, and in the short time they have been open they have earned quite the following (and rightfully so).  Add these things together, and as any BBQ aficionado will tell you: There is a chance they will run out of things. So get there early!  I love hole in the wall spots, and based on how busy Jessie Rae's has been every time I have gone, clearly I am not the only one that knows about this little gem. On my first visit, I left slightly disappointed as I had planned on eating my lunch there but couldn't due to a lack of seating. When I say this place is small, I mean tiny... There are only two tables inside, with room for 8-12 diners, so again,  get there early!! Or be prepared to eat outside at one of the picnic tables, or take your food to go.  On my second visit, I met Shirley B for lunch and Mike (the owner) was manning the register. What a fantastic guy, I love businesses where the owner is not simply present but actually a hands-on worker, and that's exactly how it is at Jessie Rae's. Mike was cordial and made us feel right at home as we dined. He even brought out a sample of the daily special, a phenomenal smoked Filet Mignon that I immediately wished I had ordered.  What I DID order was fantastic. I always get ribs when I am able to at a BBQ spot, and the ribs here were perfection. Tender, meaty, delicious. The brisket was excellent as well.  I loved the sides, especially the corn that Shirley got and let me sample. And that sauce! Everything I have had is lick-your-fingers good.   If you love BBQ, be sure support this fantastic local business and give Jessie Rae's a try ASAP.",

The meat was so tender and juicy. I don't think I've ever had rib meat fall off the bone quite like this before! Also the bbq beans were amazing as well.

The reason this gets a 4 star rating is, although the waffle fries were delicious, the portion was extremely skimpy. They gave me, literally, 5 waffle fries approx 2 inches in diameter.  I wouldn't even mention this if they put them on the plate gratuitously But, they charged me $2.50 . That works out to 50 cents for each tiny piece of potato. COME ON that is not reasonable.  If you order fries, ask for a generous portion for $2.50. They sent the order out on Uber. It arrived promptly within the announced time frame.",

    "text": "2.5 rounding down to 2 here. Came in around 11 30am and they were already out of ribs. The lady working there said that happens all the time..I mean, you already are open short hours, why would you be out an hour or so into opening? Anyway, I wanted to get the 3 meat combo. Since all they had left was chicken, pulled pork (which I am not a fan off) and brisket I went ahead and got double brisket. Now normally I don't mind being charged extra for stuff, but since you are out of the very thing I came in for, you might want to stay off charging me $7 extra just for getting double brisket. That and having to bag my own to go order, as I was just handed a togo box with another togo box with my side on top of it ( I guess I should just carry all that in my hands). So I already had a bad taste in my mouth, even before trying the food.  Now for the food. First of all I really didn't care for the bbq sauce at all. They smother the whole order in it, so I really had no choice but to have it anyway. Brisket was pretty dry. There was a good amount of it and the chicken but both were bland. It was probably a little better than the majority of Las Vegas bbq places, but that's not saying much. The mac&cheese was limp overcooked bowtie pasta with cheese..hmm. Baked beans I ordered as an extra side, because it happens to be one of my favorites. They were pretty good, smokey and pretty tasty. Probably my favorite thing I tried. I shared with my gf and we both agreed it was subpar.   So overall not a very good experience, I can't imagine I would give them another try.",

As you walk in you notice it is not a very big spot for dine in, but has a good atmosphere. I was at work this day so was hoping to be able to eat in, but you never know. I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich my work partner ordered the Brisket and Tater Tots. The pork sandwich comes with a good helping of slaw and some sauce. It was messy and good. The full smokey flavor of the pork with the tangy crisp bite of the slaw was perfection on a bun. The Brisket was also pull apart tender and had a wonderful bite as well. We tried all their sauces but the god sauce was our favorite. The staff was really friendly and they are very supportive of our first responders.   Thank you for dining at Jessie Rae's BBQ.

    "text": "On Friday, i had a hankering for some BBQ.  So i phoned by buddy LJ and decided to meet for lunch at 1130 to beat the lunch crowd.  This place is tiny!!!  When you say hole in the wall, i think it is smaller than a hole in the wall.  it is kind of like a crack in the wall.  You can fit 8 diners comfortably in here.    In total, 6 of us went to lunch together.  When we walked in, the place was empty.  In typical ME fashion, i wanted to try a little bit of everything.  So i went for the 3 meat combo which included a side.  Thanks to my YELP check-in, I was given a second side and kool aid for free!!!  The 3 meats i got were ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Sides were mac n cheese and green beans w/ pork belly.  My meal came out to $18.  This is a lot cheaper than other BBQ joints around town.    Here comes my food.  Initial reaction was WOW that is a big portion!!  3 pork ribs, 3 large slices of brisket, and a nice scoop of pulled pork.  Portion wise, you definitely get more than what you paid for.  Now the all important part... the taste.  I dug into the sides first.  Green beans were good.  And little pieces of pork belly make any dish better.  Not sure if I would get this again, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The mac n cheese was a bummer.  Wasn't as tasty as I hoped it would be.  My complaint about both sides would be that they were both a bit bland and lacked seasoning and kick.  Mac n cheese was my least favorite item.  Next, i dug into the brisket.  Thick and juicy brisket slices got my mouth watering.  This brisket was very good.  Best brisket in town in my opinion.  Next came the pulled pork.  This fatty, smokey, juicy mound of deliciousness was delightful.  This is some very tasty pulled pork.  Last, the ribs.  the smoke ring, juiciness, tenderness, flavor... everything about these ribs made me say these are without a doubt my FAVORITE ribs in town!!  Hands down #1 no doubt about it.    I've been reading about everyone raving about this God sauce.  Well, I don't know about this God sauce, but Fallen Angel is my new favorite BBQ sauce.  I drowned my food in Fallen Angel and it was so good.  This sauce will slap you in the face and let you know its there.  So spicy and flavorful.  I could probably drink a cup of it, its that good!!!",

    "text": "This restaurant is good for a \"Vegas\" style BBQ joint. To their credit I only heard about the place because the owner posted a comment on a news story and referenced their restaurant. I did a little yelp research and showed up the next day. They don't attempt to be any other style of BBQ so they get a pass on the flavor and execution.  I'm a fan of pulled pork sandwiches and expect them to be a little pricey and this one did not disappoint clocking in at $11, as of this review. No sides or drink. (Hey you have to support small businesses and good BBQ is not cheap.) So the sandwich arrives and it's a handful and a mouthful- for better or worse. It's a good value, but man when you want pulled pork you don't expect huge chunks of pork to fall out of the sandwich. Everything on the sandwich was just big- chunks of coleslaw, walnut-sized chunks of pork and the bun was big too. I digress as this is \"Vegas\" style BBQ.  Could the pork use a little more flavor? Yes and it could also use a little more char. Can the sandwich be priced a little better? Absolutely! For comparison a two item combo is $14 and that comes with a side! Make the sandwich smaller by using a smaller bun. The bun was good quality, but in Vegas it'd come with a $16 burger.   Would I go back? Sure. Jessie Rae's BBQ has character, the customer service is awesome and the menu has some exciting twists. But, the flavors need to be kicked up a little, fill the empty sauce bottles and price the sandwiches a little more aggressively and we'd have a winner. .",

    "text": "BBQ is my favorite type of food and I have been eating it for years. Ever since Pit Boss closed in Las Vegas several years ago I have been looking for a place like this. This place is the best small BBQ place in town. Forget about those other trash places like Rolling Smoke. Hot links were great, just the right amount of heat. Pulled pork was very good although a little bit too fatty. The St. Louis ribs are listed just as \"Spare ribs\" on the menu, but very good. The pork ribs are some of the largest pork ribs I've ever gotten, they are often too small for my taste. Their sauces are near perfect as well. Mustard based sauce is very good, ghost pepper BBQ sauce is good and not too spicy. Their normal sweet and tangy sauce is also extremely good, those sauces are often too sweet for my taste but this was spot on. Unfortunately they were out of mac and cheese somehow but I will definitely be coming back here.",

Just waiting for food was uncomfortable because of how small and crowded it was. 3 bar stools I think and 2 tables that could fit 2-4 people....that's it! So be prepared to order take out.  But the food was OH SO GOOD!! We got a little bit of everything! They ran out of brisket and pulled pork which I really wanted to try. But that monster beef bone was amazing!! And the buttered corn was unforgettable! I wish I had pictures! Omg the BBQ sauces, they had 3!!! ALL Soooo good! God sauce *hallelujah emoji insert here* I wanted to take a bottle home!! I didn't get to take a bottle of the God sauce home but Mike, the owner, let me have some of that amazing BUTTER they use for their corn to take home.  Can't wait to eat here again...actually I'll just order take out next time;-)",

Hubby got the maniac fries, and we ordered cornbread and some little dessert bites to go.  When I tell y'all that this food was so bomb.... IT WAS SO BOMB!! The portions were huge and we could have easily split one meal and probably still had leftovers. The flavors were poppin.... just so good. The cornbread tasted a little dry and old, but the desserts were good.  The cook gave us some extra cornbread because they were out of the bbq mash- so sweet!!

    "text": "[UPDATE 3/21/18: Confirmed via phone that they don't offer AYCE any longer. It's still yummy food though.] Having a tiny dining room to myself almost makes me wanna keep it that way, but I'm puzzled that I'm only the 6th person to try the new AYCE offer.  I was going to head back to Jessie Rae's BBQ sooner or later, and they enticed me back (relatively) sooner by announcing an all-you-can-eat offer via their Facebook page on April 1st - but they're not actually foolin' around. It's only available Mondays through Thursdays, 2-6pm, but if you really want to fill your belly with smoked meat for just $25, maybe you'd better take a day off to enjoy this.  AYCE basics here: up to two meats at a time in relatively small portions, including any pork ribs (spare or baby back, two bones at a time), pulled pork, brisket (chopped or sliced), chicken. Beef ribs and burritos not allowed, I'm not sure about limits on sides, and I'm guessing the \"loaded\" dishes, sandwiches, and tacos are good. And, of course, no to-go boxes, but I was welcome to a fountain drink and ended up shuttling my Gatorade fruit punch out the door (but let's be honest, everyone knows that drinks are such a cheap expense for businesses).  My orders went as follows:  - baby back ribs, brisket (chopped; I didn't specify), cole slaw - spare ribs, pulled pork, waffle fries - spare ribs, corn w/ smoked butter, tater tots  I don't recall seeing the huge, fatty spare ribs on the menu before, and I enjoyed those more than I did the relatively petite baby back ribs. Brisket and pulled pork were both pretty good, if a bit dry at times. Cole slaw was the same creamy goodness that I'd previously enjoyed, corn was not as bad as I remembered back at their now-closed second location, and both types of fried potatoes were perfect in crispy/fluffy texture and flavor. I can vouch that the tater tots stay crunchy for at least an hour, or however long it took for me to slowly clear enough stomach space to put down the last rib.  Sauces are still the star. I wasn't that enamored with the Pig Sweat (vinegar sauce) this time, but both the God Sauce and semi-spicy Fallen Angel remained addictive. That makes me grateful that they have one of each sauce bottle per table now. It's not that large an expenditure for them because there are only 4 tables inside (and a bench outside). Maybe it's just an off-hour of the day, but I was fortunate to have time to finish my scraps without feeling that I was taking up space (all the while enjoying their Futurama marathon streaming on TV).  Jessie Rae's is still one of the best local options with their \"Las Vegas Style BBQ,\" especially through their regular menu. Those are filling enough as-is, and they have the advantage of portability, so you'll only want to attack the AYCE here if you have a huge appetite and a fair bit of time - but if you do, prepare yourself for one of the better off-Strip buffets of any shape or size.",

I just feel when you go to a restaurant and order food it should all be fresh and you can tell it wasnt.. I also asked if they have salt and pepper and they said no but she brought me a side of their seasoned rub ..you don't use that to put on your food.. I've never in my life been to a restaurant where they don't have salt or pepper...",

    "text": "I decided to try this place because Postmates was offering a free delivery promotion. Not totally disappointed but I probably won't order from here again - there are far better options in this city. The meats are generously portioned, juicy and flavorful. Rolls are a real downer and wasn't impressed with the Mac-n-cheese although it does have a unique flavor. They sent two 1.5oz portion cups of sauce for a meal made for 4 which I paid extra for. The kicker was the \"mini cobbler\" - $4 each for approx. 4oz \"cobbler\" that was almost exactly the same as the dessert that comes in a kids cuisine TV dinner (see attached pic)! So sad. Anyhow, I wish them the best of luck and hope they choose to improve these issues.  *Review update: the owner responded blaming the Postmates driver, saying that they were being nice by sending me some sauce even though I DID actually order and pay for it with my meal, and proceeded to inform me that the quality of the food would be better if I came in. Maybe it's just me but you should probably pride yourself on getting quality food to your customer regardless of how it is getting to them. An attitude like that tells me I should have given you two stars instead of three and you certainly won't get my business again.",

Orders are placed at the counter and delivered to your table. A small variety of sodas are available in the self serve refrigerator. Plastic is used for the utensils and plate. The wait time for the food was short. This seems to be a one person operation as the same person worked the counter, filled the order in the kitchen and delivered it to the table.   My order consisted of 2 meats and one side. I chose the spare ribs, pulled pork and green bean casserole. The ribs were meaty and tender with a deep smoke ring. The pulled pork was tender and smoky. However there was too much fat . I prefer much leaner pork. Sauce is not required but the God sauce is delicious and kicks up the flavor. Definitely try it. I recommend the green beans which were great with a nice crunch from the fried onions on top.",

The Beans...are these beans from a can?  I swear I know this taste.  Not even a dollop of your own sauce to make it unique? Hrumph.  The 2oz sauce is less than the 1.5 oz the container is labeled as. As they are only filled half way (if you considering to order take out .50 cent for 2 oz that's not even 1oz is a joke) it's not the money but it also is as it's a sad little rip off of what's advertised and what I'm receiving are two completely different things.  I call to to inform them of what I even called \"silly complaints\" but worthy of notification, to someone who couldn't care less about a customers complaint \"over the Phone\". She actually wanted me to call the delivery service to file these specific complaints. I'm ninety-nine percent sure the delivery service has nothing to do with the quality of the meal.  This place,  If they have to save money by using poor quality products and misadvertising sizes while also overpricing their items and not making them special in any way.

I had The Duke (pulled pork) on Mac & Cheese. In the same order, but for someone else, was The Belt Buckle (brisket) on Mac & Cheese, and a few 2 meats and 1 side combos, meats including chicken, brisket, spare ribs, and pulled pork.  The biggest problem was the sheer amount of grease that was on The Duke and the Belt Buckle. It was seriously off putting. The second problem was that the mac and cheese had zero cheese flavor and the macaroni pasta was over cooked, incredibly bland.  The meats themselves were tender, but overall lacking in the flavor department. I honestly mostly tasted grease, even after draining the grease off my meal. The thought of getting waffle fries or tots that would soak up the grease is just terrifying to me.  I felt the food was over priced for what we got. Portions of the Loaded in Las Vegas meals (aka the Duke and Belt Buckle) were good, but the flavor made me feel it wasn't worth it. The portions of the 2 meats and 1 side meals looked small for what we paid.",

I was going to try a piece of chicken on the side as well, but they forgot to put it in my to go bag(also my fault for not double checking my order before walking out). We went halfsie on the sandwiches, so that we can each try them both. They were both great choices, but I've gotta say, next time I will go with The Jessie Rae. The pulled pork was delicious, it had just the right amount of juice and tenderness and the size of the sandwich was well worth the prize. They were not stingy with their meat at all, we both had pulled pork falling off our sandwiches with every bite(made me forget about the side of chicken I didn't get). I would definitely recommend this place to any BBQ eater.",

The ribs were lukewarm and kind of wet--my guess is that they were already cooling it down and reheated it with steam.  Minor annoyance--they sauced the ribs (and the beans) before serving--despite there being sauce at the table.  A note:  at the time I visited, they had a sign saying they were open Saturdays, but ONLY the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the month.",

First impression - Very Impressed and the service and greeting at the counter was a great start to the overall experience.   I had the simple  pork platter and the meat was so tender I didn't even need a knife.  Great smoke ring and the seasoning was spot on.  The Smoked Pork Belly Baked Beans..oh my were they delish.  I also had the Jessie's Mac n Cheese and it was good but a bit on the bland side...might I suggest a bread crumble with butter and garlic as a topping for this creamy delicious gooiness.   And to top it off as I walked out the door, a huge thank you was shouted at me...you don't see that often these days.   I will be back and I strongly suggest you give this place a try.",

My girlfriend gets \"The Duke\" every time we come and I get a 3 meat platter bc I can never decide between all of their delicious offerings.  If your lucky enough to be here when they have beef rib, get one if you think you can eat it all!    I highly recommend you take the time to come here bc you will want to come back the next day.

    "text": "Went here late Friday and unfortunately they were closing.  They had run out of BBQ.  The owner Mike? was out back when I pulled up and I asked him if this was the BBQ place and he said it was.  He said they had some chicken but I had wanted some pork or beef ribs.  He said they had one beef short rib left and said I can have it for $4.  I said sure because I was really looking forward to BBQ.  I had a bite and it was delicious.  Had to give the meat a little tug but it came clean off the bone. He gave it to me in a Styrofoam box so I did not see the inside of his place.  He was very friendly and also gave me a bunch of paper towels.    I asked him what kind of smoke he uses and he said he used peach, maple, and something else I don't remember but he said he will change it up daily, weekly,... depending on what he has.  I was thinking when he said that, that he should really just stick to 1 combo, since it imparts flavor to the BBQ and the BBQ will taste different if you use different wood.  My 1 suggestion to him is if he has to change his wood (keep you minds out of the gutter) maybe stick to certain woods on specific days, that way if you try it and you like a specific type of smoke flavor you can always come back the next week for the same BBQ.  Otherwise if the smoke flavor is good one time and is not to your liking another time it would be a hit or miss if you get the same BBQ, but if you used the same wood on specific days then people would come back on that day knowing it would be good to their liking.    Unfortunately, I do not live in Vegas otherwise I would go back earlier and really try it out.  He also said to me if I called prior to my coming and it would be late again he would make sure he would have what I had ordered.  Which when I think about it I would hope so if I ordered it before hand.  lol.  He was a very nice guy and I will definitely go back next time I am in Vegas.",

My boyfriend and I were craving good and authentic BBQ food, and after reading all of the positive reviews and looking over what seemed like a promising menu, we thought this place was the winner. But we soon left after being encountered but an extremely rude hostess.   We walked in, and a woman who was standing behind the counter, who sounded like she had one too many cigarettes, immediately asked us if we had been there before. When we responded with no, she said that the menu was on the wall. She said this in such a harsh and inhospitable way, and we felt as if we were bothering her, just by being there.   We brushed it off though, because we were hungry, and this place did look promising, after all.   While my boyfriend and I browsed the menu on the wall, she informed us that the restaurant was out of waffle fries, and some other menu items. We both looked at each other, and asked what it is that she just said, because we couldn't understand it. She repeated it, once again as if we were bothering her, and then followed it by yelling, \"we run out of food every day\" and stormed to the back of the restaurant.   Well, that was the final straw and we immediately walked out. If the hostess could have been a little more patient or hospitable, then this place definitely would have had our support. Too bad.",

My friend ordered the jive chicken.   The order was supposed to take around 45 minutes. It arrived in about 30. The driver was courteous and he delivered it directly to our room on the 10th floor. The order was correct and it was still hot.  It is rare to order delivery and everything is correct. I didn't get a chance to eat when the food arrived but heated up everything around midnight. It was absolutely delicious. I would order from them again and again.  It was better than the local red, hot and blue and famous Dave's. Everything we ordered totaled $55. That was including the $9 delivery fee and tax.   I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good BBQ around the strip. I believe they are located behind Mandalay Bay.",

She was kind of loud and they had a dumb TV Show of sick humor; showed a guy humping a chair, girls acting stupid while drunk doing lap dances...very distasteful. There were young kids and teenagers with their family on another table...not good.   2) Either she had \"preference\" as she gave the same short service to the two gents ahead of me; whom appeared to be Pilots and of foreign decent. (Uniforms) of a local aereal entity.  3)However, when \"other\" customers walked in  she greeted an treated them with elaborate information and even walked out to explain the  menu. Therefore, I'm OUT. FOOD wasn't that great either. Had slaw and macncheese...give it a \"C\" overall..",

Sides are on the small side for the price (when ordering \"to go\" at least). My least favorite part though was the cashier lady. Manners were absent. If no one was ordering she was standing at the register eating. When my order was ready instead of walking over and handing it to me she repeatedly yelled \"ma'am!\" from the register until I realized I was \"ma'am\". Meh. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",

    "text": "I want to like this place and have given it multiple chances but it mostly comes up mediocre at best.  Here is why: 1. Side portions are too small!  The sides and $2.99 a la carte.  Not too bad but they give you an actual measuring cup full.  If I'm gonna have meat leftovers, then I'm gonna want sides to go with them! Needless to say, a cup isn't an appropriate amount of sides. 2. The meat is ultimately bland.  While driving home, I could smell the BBQ in the to go box.  It had a canned sort of smell.  Got home and the pulled pork isn't pulled and barely tastes different from the chicken or brisket.  The meat was tender enough but not dressed with anything and all piled on top of itself.  Nothing complex or even smokey about any of the meats. 3. The sauces are too spicy.  Spice is not a flavor. It's used to hide bad or bland flavors.  3/4 of the bbq sauces here are spicy. Review point #2. Enough said. 4. A few times I have been in the restaurant is had flies buzzing around.  That grossed me out. The first time I ate here, q little over a year ago and it was amazing.  It's never been the same since .",

Some of the most tender and flavorful brisket that I've ever tasted, and I've tasted a lot. The pulled pork was in nice chunks not shredded and contained just the right amount of flavor. The sides were delicious and could stand alone on their own.  My recommendation would be to get the red slaw and pour it on top of your bbq and enjoy some Great Vegas BBQ.  I know I will soon see their delicious sauce for sale all over. The Carolina reaper sauce has just the right amount of heat, don't let the name scare you, you can handle it...I look forward to my next visit and will make sure to stop here.",

    "text": "Alright since the number of reviews was stuck at 666, I thought I would bless it and push it along.   I am originally from Oklahoma and got into smoking meat for family and friends on a regular basis and really enjoyed it. Now that we live in LV, I don't think of it as a BBQ city or part of the country for that matter as Texas and KC are kings when it comes to BBQ. I moved here from Atlanta and really couldn't find great BBQ there either unless you love vinegar, which I do, but not soaked in my BBQ.  I have tried a few others around town and have not been back, but after a coworker suggested this place by our office I am a return customer. A bit pricey for a sandwich combo which was $11.95 for a sandwich and and extra $5 for side and drink which is a bit much, but if people are paying...  I had the Duke which is a pulled pork plate and picked BBQ mashed potatoes for my side. It came out served with the pulled pork on top of the mashed potatoes on a small cookie sheet and I was surprised by the portion. The meat was tender with a perfect smoky flavor. My coworkers had the brisket sandwich which looked to be piled with a nice serving of meat. The homemade sauces are really good. The sweet and tangy sauce is called God Sauce and the Fallen Angel is the spicy sauce with touch of Carolina Reaper peppers and is not really that hot but has great flavor and doesn't take away from the BBQ.   This place is small and I have heard stays pretty busy with a line out the door. We got there at 11:30 and was able to beat the rush and get 1 of 4 tables. I am sure as they grow they will relocate or open a bigger second location as this is too good not to expand in the future.",

I was salivating after I left the airport and the location is tucked away in an industrial park and the aroma was mouth watering when I got out of the court. I was greeted warmly by Rebecca when I strolled thru the door and she was patient answering my questions regarding the meats, portions and sides. She is a real asset to the restaurant with her friendliness, helpfulness and was generous with her time. I had the three meat platter with baby back ribs, sausage and brisket and they have a plethora of sauces although I like to use little sauce and let the meat speak for itself. My only knock in the joint is a lack of greens whether it is Collared or green beans. I like to eat something relatively healthy to counteract the meat.  I will definitely return to this gem when I come back in April. A True bbq joint in Vegas has been found and I think this place will take off when the Raiders start play in 2020!",

Come early for a seat during lunch or you can always sit on the outside benches. They recently expanded to the seating area inside so now they have even more tables. I have tried the Jessie Mac sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese 5/5 and thought it couldn't be beat.   Today, to my delight I found a new favorite! The belt buckle (guaranteed to make you loosen your belt buckle if you finish your plate). It comes with a bed of Mac and cheese and then topped off with BBQ beef brisket perfectly seasoned and add some signature award sauces to make it even better. Today I had the God Sauce and Fallen Angel which is made from the hottest pepper on Earth, the Carolina Reaper. They have also recently added a couple sauces to the tables: Slammin Bamma (similar to ranch but even better) and Mustiah (mustard based sauce).   As long as Jessie Rae's is BBQ'ing this place is a must try for any BBQ lover! They have another award winning sauce called Pig Sweat which is also good. No wonder this place ranks high on Yelp with a 4.5 over 400 reviews.   Can't wait to come back and get messy!",

The baby back ribs were amazing too and were about as meaty as I've seen anywhere. I liked their sauces too, especially the hotter one which is a little different than the usual BBQ sauce. The sides here are okay but aren't anything special, the beans and mac and cheese could've come out of a can. Doesn't matter though, the meat makes this place worth checking out.",

And the woman at the desk was so nonchalant about informing us. Almost seemed careless. It was not too bad at first though because I still like pulled pork and the photo of their mac and cheese looked good. However,, when they brought it out it looked anything but. The cheese was almost water it was runny. It was also supposed to have some sort of chili flakes on top but they were absent (out of that too I guess). The corn had no butter (which I guess it usually does?) and the soda machine was pretty much carbonated water.   I swear I am not a hard one to please at all.. but I want some satisfaction out of what I pay for when it's almost $30 for a meal with a couple of sides. Hopefully they improve in the future.",

Any who opted for the Jessie Rae sandwich with waffle fries and a cornbread muffin. The wait wasn't long at all and my server was a very kind lady. Once my plate was brought to my table, the aroma from the tasty goodness wafted up to my nose and sweet Jesus it was time to grub. The sandwich was amazing, the meat tender bread crispy, waffle fries golden blonde and delicious. Loved the fact that they have a variety of sauces to dip with, the God sauce was probably my fav followed by the fallen angel.

We've been to many over the past few decades.   My 10 year old daughter said after the meal, \"this is the best place in Vegas.\"  I couldn't discount her statement.  The bbq plate we got was lots of good food.  Pulled pork, chicken and sausages were done right.  We also got two sides included.  The mac n cheese was the best.  I loved how they did the mash potatoes.  Still chunky with some peels in there, using quality spuds.  We ordered more sides they were so good.  And drinks included.  Not only was this great food, the value was spot on.  This is a small place.  But we loved the whole time we were there.  The lady running the place was on her own out front, but she knew what she was doing.    I've known for decades the the best places in Vegas are off the strip.  If you're not renting a car and checking these places out, then the best of Vegas is missing you.  We will visit this joint every time we're in town.",

My hubby and I have been dying to try it given all the good reviews on both Yelp and Facebook.  My husband had the Maniac Fries (reg size). They  are waffle fries toped with brisket, hot links and mac and cheese. Yes, they were super yummy. The brisket from my double brisket sandwich was super tasty and moist. Its also topped with coleslaw which I normally hate, but it made the sandwich and I ate it all with a little help from my hubby. We also decided (mostly me) to try their spare ribs which also did not dissapoint.   We will definitely be going back. Please remember thay this is a small place. They have about 4 tables in the dinning room which seat around 15 ppl max. They do delivery and catering for larger parties.",

Being our first time, I looked over the menu and decided on the McDowel Rib sandwich and made it a combo with bbq mashed potatoes, drink and corn bread. It came out to around $18. A little on the expensive side. We sat down and our food was delivered to our table that had a variety of house made sauce. The sandwich had two huge slabs of rib meat. I had to take one out so I could eat it. The one I took out had a lot of the tough cartilage pieces so I had to pick those out. Overall it was good bbq but It wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving it.",

    "text": "DO NOT USE THE YELP PREFIX MEAT COMBO....went in and used the the $16 \"special\" for two peeps, $32 total. We received an appetizer of waffle fries covered with pulled pork and sauce which was quite good. Then a plate was brought to us with 3 thin burnt ribs, two small pieces of brisket some chicken, a side of cole slaw and a side of a potato dish. When I bit into the burnt rib my teeth went through the very soft marrow bone and I had to spit it out. Gross. The 1/32\" rock hard bark on the thin ribs were inedible & the bones broke into many pieces. The sliced chicken was decent. They should try a new recipe for the brisket as it was mushy and nothing special. In the meantime I'm wondering if our second plate of food was being brought out. But no. TWO yelp specials consisted of three thin ribs, two small slices of brisket, a small pile of sliced chicken and two small sides plus the appetizer FOR $32. After tip and tax $40. Wow!! The $22 dollar \"hungry three meat item\" seemed like much more food. I mentioned my issues to the owner and he acknowledged. He later brought out two more ribs (which were THE BEST I've had in LV) and two more afterwards. I don't know why restaurants serve their customers their crap only to wait for the complaining and then respond with a much better replacement instead of serving good fresh food in the first place. Bottom line: the owner was very kind and the second ribs were outstanding. I'll be back knowing what and how to order next. BTW the cole slaw was fabulous. Fresh Ribs and cole slaw only for me next time....that is all",

As a black guy from Chicago with parents from Alabama, my childhood had alot of bbq.  As a result, Ive been to any place in vegas using the bbq theme.  This was sadly a waste of my time and tips (17 bucks).  I ordered 2 meat special, brisket and ribs with Mac and Cheese.  The brisket was actually lower end grocery store roast.  It was cooked ok, the ribs were very skinny and honestly tasteless.  No smoke flavor more like a baked style with a broiled skin.  The ribs tasted ok and the food did stay down, which has become a standard for me here in vegas.  I would suggest rolling smoke, at least there is a flavor, there brisket is actually brisket and you get a roll to die for.  I will not be back to Jessies and will not recommend it to any fares.  I honestly expect them to be out of business soon, i doubt they are solvent. Last but not least, some of the WORST bbq sauce ive tasted.",

But, Yelpers promised it was great, so we soldiered on. Inside, the place was packed, which I took as a good sign.  This place is a hole in the wall in every sense. It's in kind of an industrial area, it's a tiny place with maybe 4 tables, and there is nothing fancy inside (broken floor tiles, mismatched chairs, self service drinks/sauces). While we were waiting for our take out order, a family (clearly from out of town) came in and was obviously put off, and even asked if they were in the right place and if there was a 2nd location somewhere. BUT, I can overlook all of it as long as the food is great, right??  So was the food great?? Again, a mixed bag. As far as the meats go, A+. The chicken and brisket were both excellent. Super tender and flavorful. I, also, enjoyed the sauces. They have 3 to choose from, a thinner vinegar based sauce, a thicker/sweeter sauce, and a super spicy ghost pepper?? sauce. I enjoyed the 1st 2. My husband braved the 3rd one and confirmed it's spiciness, but felt it still had a good and balanced flavor.  Where the food disappointed me was in the sides department. I had both the baked beans and the corn with smoked butter. Both just tasted like they came out of a can. Really disappointing given how great the meats were. I was told by another customer to order the waffle fries, and I wish I had heeded that advice.",

My girlfriend and I got one each and was able to sample everything (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc)   Everything was delicious and the service was amazing! This is a family owned business the mom of the owner was worker and was the sweetest person in the world. She let us mix our bbq sauces to see what we enjoyed the most. I like the spicy one with the vinegar based one.   My side was mac and cheese and you want to talk about cheesy and gooey this is the place. there was no place for plain noodle there. Every bite was heaven and I couldn't stop eating it. My girlfriend got waffle fries and they had buffalo and ranch on them which was delicious.   Great news is that they deliver since they are about 20 minutes but I would want the whole experience. Next time I want to try the corn bread because we didn't get to and on Thursday they have beef ribs. (16.00 a rib) but I heard it is worth every bite and dollar. I am so excited to try this place out more often  Forget about Dickeys, Lucilles and every other bbq place because this place is heaven on earth obviously they have fallen angels (that's the name of a sauce).  You want good fall off the bone bbq, with house made sauces and wonderful service, you found it if you come here. This is what is great about mom and pop shops, you can taste the love in the food :)",

The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.  After perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53  I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.  We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.  Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.  The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!  So would I stop here again. Perhaps, but I think I'd try something different.   And bottles or cans of soda would be great so you wouldn't have to stop somewhere else.",

The belt buckle had fries underneath that savory meat, and the Duke had Mac and cheese.  We preordered before coming, but when my boyfriend came to pick up they said the computer glitches and order didn't go through. It was a bummer BUT the guy at the register was so nice, he threw in an EXTRA order of food (another Duke), gave us a discount, and gave us a crap ton more God sauce. Wait, hold on...before I go on...that God sauce man. It was AMAZING. Basically liquid gold in my mouth. Ok, moving on. We thought it was great of him to really cater to us and make up for the mistake. Thanks so much guys!",

The chef came out to tell us that even though we ordered baby backs, he was giving us St. Louis style instead because he didn't like the way the baby backs came out. I really appreciate that. The ribs were very good as was the brisket. The sides (potato salad, beans, & mac & cheese) were also very good. There was nothing that stood out as outstanding about the meal, but it was certainly tasty and not over priced. I would definitely go again if I'm in the area.",

I researched bbq places and decided to try Jessie Rae's.  I am so happy I did, and so was the rest of my family, all 24 of us.  I ordered the meal that Had baby back ribs and chicken and serves 20 people, then additional 10 pieces of chicken just to make sure there was enough.  Come to find out I didn't need the extra, there was plenty with the original order.  Everyone raved over the food, especially the ribs but not taking anything away from the chicken, it was all delicious.  I highly recommend Jessie Rae's and will add it to my places to go when I visit Las Vegas again.",

A 2 meat combo brisket and ribs Mac n cheese. And the Maniac appetizer. $50  The place was filthy. No one cleans here. I'd hate to see the kitchen if that's how they leave the dining area. Not to mention the girl with the dope cough, at the register handling food with her bare hands.   The brisket wasn't done, it's was more than likely pulled too early. Has the texture of a med rare steak.   The chicken is chopped thighs that had the consistency of rubber.   The ribs were fantastic especially with the Ghost pepper bbq sauce.   The maniac was also delicious. Waffle fries with Mac n cheese and pulled pork and hot link.   All in all this place has the potential to be great but is poorly managed.  To answer the owners question we were there at 545 pm on Friday 5-25-18.  The girl at the register was filling Togo containers from a larger container, at the register. And her over all attitude sucked.   Quite the wholesale price difference between brisket and tri tip, yea??   Best of luck to you.",

They also open at like 1030 which was a perfect way to start/end not really sure, my day.  Brisket unreal delicious bark, great rub and with just a little sauce goes down so smooth.   Short rib, huge and I actually enjoyed the bark so much on it I didn't even add sauce.  All the sides were so good, just the right amount of dressing on the slaw, beans had a nice smoke brown sugar flavor, and the mac n cheese... goodnight!   THE VERDICT: One of the best BBQ places in vegas, open up your mind and go and try it, especially that ghost pepper bbq is such a sweet and spicy sauce that makes you feel so macho youll turn into randy savage.

My rating is going to be a 4 still because even with the disappointments, they weren't bad enough to bother me.  I wish I could leave a 3.5 or 3.7  1. Service  Service was quick, polite, and friendly but definitely not what I would call \"experienced\" or \"professional\" and that probablyisnt their goal which is fine also because it is completely a whole in the wall.    2. Food We ordered the baby back ribs, brisket, and mac and cheese.  The brisket was cooked the perfectly.  The ribs were tender but you could tell they'd sat under a heating lamp or something for a bit so therefore a tad dry on top.  The mac and cheese was kind of spicy and not for me.  The cheese reminded me of box preparation.  As a previous reviewer said, the meat was in fact bland and could've used some help.  I guess the star of this whole visit was the sauce, which I actually enjoyed.",

    "text": "I have to update my review just to make it perfectly clear that Jessie Rae's is consistently amazing on multiple levels. The customer service is wonderful. The owner, Mike, leaves the front of house to his wonderful mother. She is a saint. So personable, welcoming, a straight shooter.   We had some family in town visiting from North Carolina and brought them here for lunch. We ordered quite a bit, as we were a super hungry party of 5, and were accommodated so quickly. My family was blown away. Totally loved it. Said it was better than any BBQ they had in the Carolinas.  But the ribs. Oh. My. God. The spare ribs are to die for. Literally, the best freaking ribs I've ever had. My 5 year old son would agree. I have never seen a kid that size put down that much meat and that many waffle fries in my life. He LOVED the pastrami special last month. I don't think I've ever seen a kid eat pastrami. I consistently have to argue with him to share because he is convinced he's going to eat a 3 meat combo with fries and a full rack of ribs by himself. In the end, he puts down half of it, all the fries, and asks for an additional side of fries to go.   Back to the ribs. Fall off the bone tender. Flavorful, juicy. PLENTY of meat. You definitely get your monies worth here. Anything you order will be good, I promise you. They have won LV's Best BBQ & Sauce for a damn good reason. Beef rib special on Thursdays, which I am dying to try!   Check out their Instagram for other special menu items, too.",

The server/hostess/busser left other tables with dirty placemats, someone over worked I could understand but they had just opened so our dirty table was from the day before.   But..the barbecue was outstanding!, tender, tasty, smoky, falling off the bone yet not mushy. Great flavor and very rich and complimentary barbecue sauces perfectly enhanced the great flavor. So I will return again, but only for takeout!",

    "text": "How they have these 4 and 5 star reviews is beyond me, they should be closed!  As I always stress in all my reviews my husband and I are in the restaurant business and there are things we will overlook or be understanding about but when your serving food that can make people sick and your place is filthy I have a real problem.  Yes this place is a hole in the wall so I dont expect the ritz but your place can be clean! I was a restaurant owner both here and in NY, and my places were small but clean and safe. I took pride in my food and establishments. But there is no pride here, I mean this place looked like a redneck yard sale. The table cloths were sticky the chairs were mismatched and the seat covers were ripped and the sauces on the table tops were gross! The tops were crusted with old sauce so you know they haven't been washed in awhile and for covers they were using souffle cups... really? Also the sauces need to be refrigerated, and there needs to be labels There were sauces that we had no clue what they were because, no label. And I wasn't about to taste test that filthy mess.  Now the food. I see that the importance of food temperatures is lost on this place. They obviously dont understand that food that is not prepared to and kept at safe serving temperatures can be DANGEROUS. There is something called the Temperature Danger Zone. Pork, Chicken, Beef, and Seafood must be kept at proper safe serving temperatures to prevent the growth of food born bacteria. The fact is People can get very sick and can even die from undercooked or improperly held food. Anyone remember the fire fly restaurant incident?  But from what we experienced I can guarantee the staff and owner have ZERO understanding of proper health department procedures and policies. They dont even care about the basics, your place should be clean, safe and most important hot foods are kept hot and cold foods cold. It is that simple.  For this place I guess not so simple.  We ordered beef ribs, pulled pork, chicken, brisket, loaded mashed, mac n cheese and coleslaw.  All the meat was luke warm at best, and we sent it back TWICE. When it came out the second time it was clearly microwaved, with some fresh sauce thrown on it to \"cover up\" the mess. Also the coleslaw was luke warm.... coleslaw is a mayonnaise product and needs to be refrigerated that alone could make someone deathly ill.   The luke warm meat is a real concern, so either their steam tables are not holding Temperature or they are just leaving the food out. Either way we have a problem.  Also the staff was not the best. The cashier/server was just rude about the whole thing. He rolled his eyes when we complained about the food being cold.  Also when he returned the second time he dropped the pans on the table and walked off.  And he wasn't surprised when we complained it was cold again. He just gave me a refund and moved on.   He also claims he called the owner, yeah right. If he was concerned about the food being cold he wouldnt have kept ringing in and serving new guests coming in after us since he knew there was an issue with the food. But I guess he was more concerned about having to return at 4am the next day since he made it a point to complain to us about  his schedule.  This place is just horrible, and not safe.  And what is really scary to me is they have the contract to supply food to the raider stadium when it opens! So if this place cant keep food safe and hot for 20 people how are they going to keep it safe for 10,000 ?",

The chicken, instead of giving you a half chicken, like most barbeque places, was diced, shredded and the amount of meat amounted to probably less than a full breast.

The concept of the Jessie Rae sandwich is awesome; however pork was very dry and had to cover with God sauce to make it worth eating. God Sauce was good. Overall not a good experience, maybe I caught them on a bad day, will take a lot of convincing to go back.",

The atmosphere is a mom/pop style. The plates , forks, knives are disposable so no real dishes. I tried the yelp special (chefs choice of meats and sides). The special is $16 , but minimum is two so really $32 for the yelp special . The special today were brisket , pork ribs , pulled pork, chicken thighs, and link sausage. The sides were a piece of bread , corn and beans. The beans tasted like bushes beans from a can. The corn tasted like from a can but marinated in butter . The coleslaw was ok. The sauces are good. In interior climate was set to 81 degrees (that's the thermostat Reading from wall). It was hotter inside the restaurant than outside .  The overall food temperature was room temp and not hot. I'm assuming if you get here first thing in morning or lunch it may come out hot like a bbq. Customer service was good.",

Despite that I wanted to return the next day I call to place an order, but they ran out of meat, so whatever I figure I come back tomorrow.  Next day I come in, same issue no meat other than spareribs, I find this out after waiting for two, \" people\" to ask every question under the sun about portion sizes.  These two somewhat minor inconveniences and the fact the location is out of the way is keeping me from ever returning again, there's a lot of good BBQ places here to spend money at that are much more convenient.  It explains why each visit I made only 3 people were there despite the food being good quality, maybe I'll try them again in 2019.  Quick update owner responded to my benign review, I decided to change to a 1 star from a 3 star, weirdest customer service exchange of my life.   He sends me string of snarky PM's then publicly post a professional response, one that I would have expected In the beginning, but did not receive until posting my PM's. Sure I can't wait to return lol.",

I will have to go again to confirm the consistency but judging how above and beyond juicy and tender the meat was I cannot imagine it being tough and dry. I absolutely adored the rib tips and I'm never impressed by ribs but these were meaty and tender. The pulled pork was great as is usually the case anywhere. My only complaint was with the brisket it tasted great with a nice depth of smoke ring but it was sliced with the grain instead of against it. I've never seen this, it just makes it more difficult to eat. Overall the meat quality was outstanding and the bbq sauce was very good even the spicy one made with \"the reaper\" pepper.",

We came at 5:00 on a Friday and while they were out of most of the sides, there was enough meats left to serve everyone who came in.  And can I just say the tater tots CHANGED MY LIFE.  They sprinkle them with powdered unicorn or something.  Pork spareribs, chicken breasts, chopped brisket and pulled pork were all AMAZING.  Dry rubbed like whoa, beautiful smoke ring on everything, and a char crust that soaked up sauce like it should.  We weren't brace enough to try the Fallen Angel sauce, but the sweet and sassy \"God Sauce\" was perfect for dipping, and the thin vinegar-based \"Pig Sweat\" was particularly good with the pulled pork and chopped brisket.  We will be back for sure to enjoy Jessie Rae's again!!",

I made an order through Grub Hub that was not delivered to the correct location despite the fact that I CLEARLY stated the delivery instructions when I made my order. When I finally received my order it was incorrect. I contacted Jessie Rae's and their response was that I have to contact Grubhub if I did not receive what I ordered. I found this response to be very disconcerting as Grubhub does not prepare the order. Finally, when I opened my order I found it to be nothing like the food that is advertised on their site. The meat on the sandwich was extremely dry and did not have any BBQ sauce on it. It was so dry that I did not even bother to finish the meal. I am sure that I would not try this place again even if they allowed me to eat for free. VERY dissatisfied with Jessie Rae's and Grubhub's response to my simple request. Save your money....and yourself from being disappointed....and try another place. They are not worth your time or money.  Bruce",

    "text": "Kind of an interesting experience eating here for the first time. In town for a biz convention, got a hankering for some baby backs. Yelp retrieved this place with the improbable avalanche of suspiciously great reviews.  Uber dropped me at a hole in the wall that's cramped even by the limited standards of rib joints. Ordered the 1/2 rack of baby backs while dodging the elbows of the guy at the next table. Ribs appear quickly enough, but the sloppy, too-cool-to-want-to-be-good-at-his-job server promptly dumps them on my lap, staining my jeans.  The too-cool-for-this-shiznit dude hands me a couple of feet of the lowest spec of cheap paper towels -- the kind that doesn't actually absorb ANYTHING, much less bbq sauce -- and disappears.  Another guy (the owner? He seemed to care) has noticed and quickly brings out a damp towel for my jeans, which helped a lot.  So, not exactly a great first impression. And I was sitting there thinking I was going to one-star this place like nobody's business.  But then I bit into the first baby back. Holy crap. Kid you not, the best ribs of my entire life. Just amazing. Flawless, delicious, thick, meaty, juicy to the point of insanity.  My mind is still reeling, actually, and it's now hours later.  So count this as a ten-star review for the ribs, because they started five in the hole.    If I lived in Vegas I'd eat here a few times a week.  If you're visiting Vegas, you MUST plan to eat here.  You will NOT be sorry.",

He had Jessie Rae's a couple days earlier, but said he wanted to eat it again since it was THAT good. I initially wanted to eat something on the lighter side but I thought what the hell, why not. I'll go to the gym to work it off (we'll see about that).  Ordered about $60 worth of food for 3 people (if you want a full meal with enough sides to go around, expect to spend around that much, which is normal for good bbq). We got ribs and pulled brisket for our meats and mac n cheese, coleslaw, baked beans, and corn for our sides.  Now I'm no southern BBQ connoisseur but I've tried a good number of places so I have a good sense of what's mediocre and what stands out. Jessie Rae's BBQ is the best I've had hands down. The sides were all delicious, especially the Mac n cheese. Cheesy but not gooey or mushy. The meat fell right off the bone for the ribs and when you dunk them into the sauces they provide, \"MMMMM willy don't it make you wanna slap yo mama!!\" (Friday reference, anybody?)   Will I make it to the gym tomorrow as I promised myself? Likely but not certain. Will I be returning here next time I visit Vegas? F*ck yes, without a doubt.",

I had the three meat combo of brisket, pulled pork and hot link and all three were excellent! Nice smoky flavor and very moist, almost as good as what I make at home, LOL!  The side I had, the potato salad was definitely not made by Susan, LOL! I hope you get the comedic reference.  The only downside is the closer they get to closing the more likely they are to run out of various items.  It was strongly suggested by the cashier that for future reference to call ahead to make sure they have what you want and ask them to set it to the side for you.",

A couple days ago I was reintroduced to it by my daughter. It has grown both in popularity and size. My daughter ordered brisket, pork ribs and Mac and cheese. I ordered pulled pork and cole slaw. The food was on point, and the servings are huge, well worth the price. JessieRaes BBQ, is doing big things. The staff is on top of their game, they know the regulars by name, and you generally don't find that level of service anymore these days. I hope they keep growing so we can get one closer to Silverado Ranch area, but until then I'll go where they are. Keep up the good work guys!",

Some of our favorites have been the Belt Buckle with waffle fries and brisket and an extra coating of their God Sauce plus the Two Meat with One Side Combo (I like Brisket and pulled pork plus mac and cheese). Try a corn muffin dripping in butte Portions are always so large, I need to bring some home! Food is served hot, juicy and just delectable!  Sauces are on the table for you to mix or find a favorite! God Sauce is not just a clever name but also created by the Sauce Gods! And the staff... Nifty Lady is super friendly and was quite patient with us on our first visit and Cute Boy was quick to the rescue when part of our order was accidentally incorrect. I will eventually try everything on the menu and I look forward to my upcoming visits to try something new!",

I'm in love I live in LA and haven't been to Vegas for 7 years but I'll be coming back extremely frequently for this amazing meat candy that melts in your mouth leaving you with an intense craving for MORE! The sauces are ridiculously amazing! The GOD sauce is BOSS! I had to bring some home with me for sure! I can't wait to try it on everything! Thanks for the BOMB GRUB!!!

The restaurant itself is a little hole in the wall, in an industrial area - not much to look at from the outside.  Inside it's clean, the staff is super, super friendly, and the food is served hot and in generous portions.  5 kinds of barbeque sauce on the table. The winning sandwich was epically good.

    "text": "Very disappointed. The food was underwhelming for the hype and the price. One sandwich that cost roughly 15 bucks, ($3 more because I made it a combo) was the size of a Mc Double with hard and dry pulled pork and very oddly flavored brisket. The Signature sandwich \"The Jesse Rae\" sounded fantastic, yet it did not have the cheese and the pork was like jerky there was no moisture besides the slaw. This was also upgraded to a combo for $3 more which was to include 1 side and drink. We got both of the sides, corn was ok, the mac and cheese tasted like boxed, but the drinks did not make the journey. Elements of this meal were good, the sausage was great and the slaw was cool and flavored well. When all was said and done I paid $46 ($60 after delivery, taxes and tip) for 3 sandwiches and 2 sides. The driver was kind and polite and the food got here very quickly, but the meal was a dud and there was no napkins, no utensils and no condiments. All in all, would not recommend.   This was a delivery order, so maybe some of the charm is lost by not being at the restaurant. But, buying lunch for your co-worker makes you look like a chump when you pay a ton and the food is caca with nothing to wash it down.",

I was forced to eat outside at the picnic table.  A table that doesn't get wiped down too often BTW.   2.  The girl at the front counter needs to learn to stop texting when a customer comes up to order.  She also needs to learn to bring napkins with her when she brings food to the guy sitting outside. 3.  They ran out of Brisket.  How does a BBQ place run out of their most popular meat by 3:00PM? 4.  Their current location is in a sorta seedy part of town.  It's not very close to where anybody lives.  Since the store is so small they sort of depend on take out, but I don't really think the place is worth the drive.    I used to live in Texas and to be honest there really aren't any good BBQ places here in Las Vegas.  So I am hard to please when it comes to BBQ.  I wish these folks well.  I hope they can move to a larger restaurant soon for their own sake.",

    "text": "Well the day finally came, when finally made it here. I have been trying to get to Jessie Rea's BBQ since they opened for 3 reasons. One they're \"Award Winning\" sign out front, two they are super close the my work and three all the Yelp reviews.  Ever since they opened their doors they have been instantly getting raving reviews. Then one day my co-worker went there for lunch and she was hook. I got to try a piece of her brisket and burnt end that day and I too was hook ans was craving for more. I am a bit surprise it took me so long to try them out but I eventually did and I was very happy camper.  Pulling up into to the restaurant in an industrial office area where most cafes and food joint like this caters to surrounding business you don't expect much and as you walk in there's not a whole lot...just a couple of tables and chairs no fuss no muss just the essentials and straight to the point BBQ.   A guy name James took my order over the phone being super helpful and suggestive, as well as everyone there. I placed an order for 2 sandwiches with one being free because of a handy dandy coupon I had. After checking in on Yelp I also was suppose to receive a free a small kool-aid but they were out so I got a full bottle of soda instead, \"sweet I scored thanks Jessie's BBQ\". The amazing smell of BBQ when you walk in makes your stomach growl and your mouth water. I couldn't wait to dig in.  The Jessie's sandwich was full of juicy pull pork and amazing slaw and I hate slaw but their's was so good. The sauce was freaking awesome and even though I didn't get potato chips on my sandwich like I was suppose to it was still bomb. The Brisket sand was killer, of coarse it was because of the brisket, the Mac a cheese was cheesy and deliciousness. The sausage though tasted a little like store bought sausage when the the menu made it sound like it made made in house and amazing. I'm not sure if it is made in house or store bought but I really didn't care for it and. Any how all of that was sandwiched between two amazing buttery buns with softest warmest and not over kill with the dough.   Each sandwich costs around $11-$14 bucks with no sides or soda but for about $3 or so more you can make it a combo. A little too much for an everyday lunch for me but it was worth it and that's BBQ price for you. So the next time I want to splurge on lunch I will definitely splurge here.",

I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with waffle fries.  It seriously was to die for!!  The portions are huge and I had leftovers for the next day.  The pricing is worth it for all the food you get.  You definitely don't get ripped off here!  I must say this place is #1 in my book and when family or friends come to visit I am bringing them to this secret hideaway.

This is some of the top BBQ in town, almost as good as Texas BBQ, the portions are HUGE we shared a plate with an additional hot link.   The sauces were fantastic watch out for the hot one though, because it was HOT! The flavor was very good, but it was hot. The other sauces were excellent, also.   The ribs were excellent, we had the pork ribs and not the beef, but the table next to us had the beef ribs and they looked amazing as well. I haven't seen beef ribs that looked as good as these west of Houston Texas.   The brisket was cooked as good as any I have had in Vegas, you could tell it was done low and slow.   The pulled pork was cooked with care, you could also tell that this was done correctly and that the bone came right out with ease as the meat was tender and delicious.  The only thing that wasn't off the chain was the hot link, which I would have again, but I would prefer my hot links to have more spice to them. Also at a place such as this, I prefer to see them making the hot links & sausage in house, I do not believe that they are here.   Over all this is an excellent BBQ joint even though it is small. Good things do come in small packages.   -Allen",

For starters, no utensils, no bbq sauce, no salad dressing, and no napkins. Although I asked in the comment section for all but the utensils and napkins. (thought they would be automatic). First Pork Rib I pull out of the box actually great. All down hill from there, ever other piece was burnt beyond recognition, Same for the Beef Ribs, burnt beyond recognition. (See pics). This was borderline Jerky. Cesar Salad, was shredded cabbage with croutons and yellow and white cheese. No dressing. Who the heck makes a shredded cabbage Cesar Salad? This place might win awards for thier cherry picked items cooked to perfection for judges, but the day to day fare has no quality control and just generally sucks. To add insult to injury, smoked butter on the corn adorned all the the boxes and the bag. See pics for validation if I can upload them. .",

    "text": "Growing up in Georgia, j know a thing or two about good BBQ and BBQ restaurants. It's so hard to find decently priced good BBQ in Vegas and I stopped eating Rollin' Smoke once they sold out to Pawn Stars and raised their prices. I was super excited to try Jessie Rae's after driving by it on my way to work and  decided to eat here yesterday, 11/15/17, for the first time and it will probably be my last. It was the lunch rush so it was crowded and considering how small the place is, this was handled pretty well. What I didn't appreciate was my food. I ordered the maniac fries which, as the menu says, are fries covered in mac and cheese, brisket, hot link, and bama sauce. I was charged a .75 up charge for the brisket, even though it was included with the item, and then I had to remove about 70% of the brisket as it wasn't meat, it was fat. It was a disgusting amount of fat that I tried to all keep contained to the wrapper my corn muffins came in, but it quickly spread outside of that radius and at it's peak, it was taller than the plate my food came in. I was there with a rather large group and the other person in my group who had brisket said he had the same problem, just not as severe as me. It was absolutely disgusting and over the top greasy food. I would steer clear of this \"award winning\" BBQ at all costs. I'm not a fan of Rollin' Smoke with how their prices have gone up, but at least the quality of their food is far superior to Jessie Rae's!  Edit: And what a helpful response from someone who works there! Seeing as how that was my first time there, how am I supposed to know that I need to specify what amount of fat I want for my food? I've been to TONS of BBQ places and that's never been a question. If that's an option, then whoever is taking your order should ask each customer when they place their order how much fat they'd like. And to say it's my fault that I didn't specify it because some of your customers like fatty meats, that's ridiculous. If you don't like the fact that I didn't bring it up to your staff when they were slammed and had a line out the door, or that I posted this review just one day after, then that's ok in my book. Classy customer support from the establishment. And yes, I mentioned your competitor and how 1, I don't go there anymore, and 2, about the quality of their food. If that's referencing them a lot, then I guess I'm guilty. Sorry the truth hurt with this review, but you won't have to worry about anymore from me as I won't be going back again, which I was willing to do because I wanted to try your pork and I think your sauces are great. Oh well, no loss in my book!",

    "text": "Just ordered from flaky Rae's through postmates worst mistake ! Do not order from these people delivery and always call ahead if your going to eat in because they don't have half of what's on their menu! I just spent 20 bucks on what was supposed to be beef ribs, brisket, Mac&cheese and beans they didn't have beef ribs so I happily accepted pork ribs but is that what I get NO! I get pulled pork and brisket they charged me for everything then I see I don't even have my beans! I had to call and tell them I didn't receive my beans can my post mates driver come back thank god he was even willing to and it was only then they told me they didn't have beans either and offered a refund for my beans but my question is what would of happen if I didn't call! Would you have just taken my money for my beans? Seems petty for just a $2.00 side but it's the principle!! and at the end of it all the food is mediocre that's what I get for cheating on rolling smoke so upset. Smh do better business guys!  Update:   it was the not the wrong meal that was sent the owner claimed that postmates switches my beef rib to pork so that's why I got that but if that was the case why did my postmates driver call me to tell me that there was no beef ribs and I have to call you guys to switch to pork ribs? Because obviously that's what I ordered!! .... at the end of the day the order was wrong I received no refund and the meat was not good tasted like it was probably something that was returned, heated back up and gave to me and the macaroni I don't even understand how but it tasted nothing like macaroni more like green beans I swear idk if you guys are using some kind of box macaroni then just heating it up over and over again but that was just gross and I suggest you use real food cause that couldn't of been. Lastly if the food was still good but the service was just bad I'll be honest and say but this was sadly not the case for this place bad food and service.",

They only 3 or 4 tables so absolutely no room.   While we were standing in line to order, we were always in someone's way. Drink machine, or condiment table. I had to go outside and wait after we ordered just because you start to feel Claustrophobic.   We got our food and went home to eat it. Did we want to eat there, yes of course but no room...   The ribs and brisket were amazing. This is meat that needs no sauce because it's so flavorful! I did try the sauce and also good! The coleslaw was just as good! I could easily eat 2 more orders of that. So creamy!  The only thing I didn't like was the Mac & Cheese. It tasted like box mac and cheese... No salt, no pepper, wasn't gooey cheesey and pasta was overcooked. I would love to give the other sides a try for sure!   Thank you for bringing good food to vegas.",

    "text": "Alright this was an interesting experience. First off, I love BBQ, so much so that I created Campfire BBQs Yelp Page for them. Luv to you Stefan!  Came here on a Tuesday night, after hours. This other really cool Sarah got the owner Mike to open up for a Meet Up group of about 14, so we had a catered style event.  Appetizer - Big Belt Buster: Mac n cheese, burnt ends of the brisket, BBQ sauce, etc, overall it was good but I appreciate good meat so I didn't need it all combined.  Sides - Mac n Cheese: overall it was good, except the portion I had was heavily peppered, to the point I didn't eat it - Corn: absolutely amazing with their seasoned \"queue the trumpets' butter - BBQ Mashed Potatoes: very good and heavy - Green Bean Casserole (cause it's my restaurant and I can): I love green bean casserole and this did not disappoint.  Meat - Chicken: amazing, juicy, moist, perfect  - Pulled Pork: great texture and worked very well with the BBQ Sauce - God's Sauce - Brisket: A-OK, but I'm a snob on this because of Stefan - Pork Ribs: tender and fell off the bone, good flavor - Rib Tips Sausage: wow - this was new to me, they make it in house, grinding and all, it was spicy and really different  Overall - I'd come back when I'm in the mood for a heavy lunch, super close to work and only open during the week for lunch. They do have another location inside Cactus Jack's Saloon so you can get their food there 11am - 4am in case you can't make it here. Check it out, when the weather is nice, they have a small patio as well.",

Not even Jon Taffer could save this place.  Bad Location:  In the middle of the raw construction supplies district where there are no other restaurants or residences for miles, very inconvenient.  And there are only 5 parking spots.  The inside is just big enough for 5 dirty tables and a sticky floor.  Poor Service:  The girl behind the counter was so inept that I almost felt sorry for her.  It was like they randomly picked a girl at a shopping mall and threw her behind the register to take orders 10 minutes before I arrived.  She was completely aloof.  The menu is not user friendly, some items don't describe to you what they are.  I asked other people in line and they agreed the menu was difficult to understand.  Overpriced Food:  It would take a lot of BBQ sauce to cover the mistakes with the dry $12 brisket.  My order was incorrect but since my first interaction was such a pain I said screw it and tried it.  So bad I just got up and left.  \"God Sauce\" is a stupid name and is mildly offensive.  I would not recommend this place.",

I really liked the God sauce and their hot bbq sauce was great as well not too spicy but just right. My favorite thing was all of the meat was sooooo tender and juicy and i think that plays a big role in good BBQ . I will be back here again .",

    "text": "Barbecue takes patience and know how. I'm not graced with either gift, so I prefer to grab smoky succulent meat out when the craving strikes. My love of barbecue was unleashed in Austin, Texas. I can't get there as often as I'd like, so I must search for meaty goodness near home. I don't like chains so for a long time the valley was lacking in options.   Thankfully, times have changed and the valley is now home to some pretty great barbecue. While some are growing by leaps and bounds, others are just getting their start like Jessie Rae's BBQ. They are a small operation putting love into everything they do. Open for lunch Monday thru Friday, plus an occasional Saturday.   Just minutes from the strip on Valley View, you'll be greeted with a waft of smoke that fills the air when you pull up to the quaint building that is home to Jessie Rae's BBQ. A friendly \"hello\" welcomes you at the door, the menu is simple but offers variety. If you're lucky, the owner Mike will suggest daily specials. You'll find the best selection if you go early. When they run out, that's it for the day. It's also worth a mention that all sauces are made in house. Prices are not cheap, but real barbecue never is.   The dining room is tiny so they have a steady stream of carry-out business. My brother and I were fortunate to find a seat. It took only a few short minutes before Mike brought out our grub. My combo was Pulled Pork and sliced Brisket ($14). He opted for the Double Brisket sandwich for ($12). Both had the choice of one side, we each chose the Mac N Cheese. The combo offered a hearty portion of meat, more than I could finish. Both meats were very good. I don't know that I could choose one over the other. Which is going to make the choice difficult on future visits. The brisket was extremely tender, it had a nice smoke ring and it was loaded with flavor. It was great on its own and even better with God's sauce or Fallen Angel for a more fiery bite. The Pig Sweat was the third sauce option, and I know it is customary for pulled pork, but it's too vinegary for my liking. My brother enjoyed his sandwich too; tender brisket with the extra benefit of bold and flavorful burnt ends. The bun was fresh and it was dense enough to support the weight of the meat - which can be a feat in itself. Good eatin' for sure. I just love these mom & pop gems.",

Wife had Mac and cheese loaded with pulled pork which she loved. Their \"fallen angel\" reaper sauce is super flavorful and packs a punch but the heat doesn't overpower the flavor. The \"god sauce\" was just no BS bbq sauce, super tasty.  Owner is straightforward and blunt while still being polite, which is refreshing in today's world of being scared of words. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back.",

My friend and I were super hungry...munchies to say...and agreed that the best decision for food at the time was good old bbq. Started talking about what would one get such as rib tips or baby back ribs or brisket. Talking got us even hungrier, so we looked up some joints. These guys came up with some good reviews, done.   First time going in I got the duke. Fire. This time around I got the maniac. Flame. Hot links on top of a bed of Mac and cheese on top of waffle cut fries with a choice of meat, I chose brisket. This, this was goodness. You had cheesy fries, creamy cheese with a tangy bbq taste from the brisket sauce. Going to need to order another soon. I also ordered the large portion for around $25. It's well worth it. It can feed up to 6 people if eating the right portions.  In my case i could've made it into 4 decent sized portions.  They also offer some nice sauces. White sauce was my favorite and was recommended by the lady working there. Kudos. I'll be back.",

I think since we have been patronizing the business we have sampled pretty much everything their menu has to offer.   I cannot say there was a single item that was disappointing -- sure, some were over indulgent items that my old, beat down body can no longer handle, but that does not take away from the sheer deliciousness and innovative nature of some of the times. Some of my favorites consist of Maniac Fries  which are loaded with mac n cheese sausage and brisket, The \"Jessie Mac\" sandwich, their brisket, pulled pork and hot links. As far as the sides go I always enjoy the corn with smoked butter and BBQ beans. You also do have an option to choose from their three signature sauces. if ordering the additional sauces do cost extra and you have to keep scrolling and select the sauce of your choosing at the bottom. The staff is courteous but most of my orders have been delivery or take out. You cannot go wrong with Jessie Rae's when needing that quality BBQ fix.",

The steady stream of regulars and visitors alike come to get their big, bold and tasty smoked meat fix here for good reason. I observed several meals come out while waiting on mine featuring Ribs, Brisket, Chicken, Pulled Pork and Hot Links to their Large Sandwiches & Sides with EVERY platter piled high. Bring your appetite.....Jessie Rae's fills your plate like your Grandma did with her Sunday Dinner with Family!   Now, the moment I've been waiting on for three weeks since I caught my first glimpse of Jessie Rae's BBQ on IG...the Fortress has arrived....BOOM!!! The gluttonous genius who created the Fortress has my respect, gratitude and admiration for this brilliant BBQ Feast! It all starts with a meaty, full rack of St. Louis Ribs, which were masterfully rubbed and stood upright into a circle making a bowl. Take that as a base and stuff it full of Mac & Cheese, Waffle Fries topped with Brisket & sliced Hot Links and you my friends have a Fortress!  Jessie Rae's BBQ is 100% LEGIT! Next time you're in Vegas stop on by for a meal that will satisfy your BBQ lovin' lips! #vegasbbq #fortress #jessieraesbbq",

    "text": "I was raised partially in the Memphis & St. Louis/KC BBQ scenes and am a fan of not going too heavy with sauce as the flavor of the meat itself should be sufficient to carry the experience. I lived in California for ten odd years and the best they had to offer was Lucille's BBQ (a nice experience, but very subpar BBQ in general). This is the best BBQ I've had on the West coast period. And every sauce they offer is disgustingly good. They have some oddball menu items that are insanely overpriced (get the BBQ fries sometime and I imagine you'll be as disappointed that a 20 dollar dish comes with a bed of 11 fries) but are good nonetheless. Their biggest downfall is just that they're too popular. Whether it be a pickup order or a delivery through a third party, expect it to be late and expect it to be missing something.",

It was pretty good, but nothing special. I then tried Jesse Rae's and boom!! This is the real deal. My pulled pork sandwich drenched in God's sauce and the eastern NC sauce could not have tasted better. I had some good bbq out in NC, but I am pretty sure this is the best I've ever had.

That brisket tho is ridiculously good, they give you a lot too, not to fatty and very tender and flavorful. The spare ribs were also seasoned perfect and put that spicy bbq sauce is the perfect pair. (Thanks manny for suggesting that ) the mashed potatoes were bomb as well and I think I'm gonna get this combo every time I go back in there. The total was around 18 dollars but you won't feel cheated when you leave and you won't be hungry either when your done. You get what you pay for and it is worth it for sure. You should give it a try.",

So my friend and I made our way over yesterday and... behold disappointment! We tried the meat and side sampler that's available with a Yelp check-in ($16pp). It came with Brisket, Pork Baby Back Ribs, Beef Ribs, Pulled Pork, and BBQ Chicken. The sampler produced lots of food but honestly wasn't worth it. Most of the meet was really dry. The brisket and pulled pork were least dry but just OK. Both turned out pretty fatty. The pulled pork was actually juicy in some parts and was fall apart consistency but dry and chunky in other parts.  Sides were OK, we got Mac n Cheese, Corn, Beans, Potato Salad, and some weird chunky potatoes - kind of like breakfast potatoes that had mash mixed into them? Mac n Cheese is my favorite side but it was not cheesy at all. It actually did not resemble what I have seen in other pictures at all. My favorite side here was the potato salad which I am usually not a fan of but it was the best side here. Food tasted like it wasn't fresh, especially the meat. The beef ribs were especially dry. Like super stiff pieces, dry. The food is nothing I would come back for but the home made BBQ sauce and the nice owner is what added a star. I actually felt bad because the owner asked how we liked the food and I wanted to tell him! I felt bad doing so in front of other customers. It's a tiny place and you will not have a conversation at your table without all the other tables hearing it. Think, size of a master bedroom. Who knows may be if the food was fresh it would taste better? I can't see how it wouldn't.",

We had a budget and they provided more than enough food plus extras. Some places could have sold me everything and be just shy over or under my budget but i felt we got more Jessica gave me exactly what we wanted for a great price.   The food was delivered on time and the person that delivered it \"I believe he was the other owner\" was awesome he was very helpful getting all the food setup and answered all of our questions as we were hung over and drooling ready to eat.    We had 55 guest to entertain and they all were blow away about the bbq. If I could write 55 reviews for each person that attended they would all give Jessie Rae's 5 stars with great comment.   I apologize Jessica that I didn't right a review sooner but I will stop by next time my wife and i are craving BBQ which is all the time :)   S",

I highly recommend the house barbecue sauce, our family doesn't care for the pigs sweat sauce. The Angel sauces pretty delicious. The beans are tasty and the corn is perfectly cooked.

He also brought out some smoked corn which was the best.   The dining area is small, but don't let that stop you. It's so worth it! The owner was so friendly and genuinely cared about his customers and wanted to be sure everyone loved what they were having.  We will be regulars :)  OH! And the prices were great too. Especially for legit bbq.",

If you try the Maniac fries- it's a meal in itself (small one easily feeds two...my sister and I split) waffle fries on the bottom stacked with delish Mac n Cheese, incredible pulled brisket, sausage link slices with 2 home made BBQ sauces drizzled on top. As if THAT wasn't enough, we scored the Yelp $16 prefix meat combo plate.  Another split option- chopped BBQ chicken, whole sausage link, 2 fall off the bone pork ribs and a hefty side of Mac n cheese.  Small joint (5 tables) some outside picnic tables with super friendly staff and patrons. Can't wait to go back! Worth your effort!!",

However if you are seeking price value, customer service and food quality this place fell short of my expectations with such high reviews from others.   I took my family of four for a new BBQ experience only to walk away really disappointed. We all ordered the meat combos and what was served on they trays wasn't worth the price at all. Really the trays were half empty. I ordered chicken and brisket with potato salad. The cashier yelled from the kitchen door they were out of potato salad then walked up to the table and asked what else I wanted which was nothing however the rest of the family got a mac and cheese to share. I got five chunks of dried chicken and a slice of brisket that was 1/3 fat slab. My mom did say the hot links were good and my little did enjoy their mac and cheese. They gave us complimentary corn bread that was served cold with a slop of butter on top which really wasn't a treat; honestly I thought it was to makeup for items that weren't available but no she did it for everyone in the restaurant. It was just really mediocre and I am disappointed we spent $100 for a meal that left us leaving feeling blah and even worse when we walked out we still were not satisfied of having our craving for BBQ fulfilled.   Also with my oldest son aspiring to be a chef himself one day he found it really disappointing when the kitchen door opened and the prep area was filthy and food was being kept in crock pots.   As I sit here writing my review the hostess is bragging that no one ever complains or is disappointed leaving well we decided that the four of us won't need to eat here again.",

    "text": "Like most, I thought the BBQ sauce was terrific.  They are going to be selling it in the bottle soon and definitely would buy it.  The pulled pork was delicious though the portion was a little small.  The other item I had was the chicken and it was two legs.  I like legs but that wasn't what I expected.  If it is only going to be legs, that needs to be stated up front.  I ate there and was pretty disappointed with the facilities.  Like a number of BBQ places, cutlery was plastic.  I don't like that at all!  In their case, it was only a fork.  Jessie said the place was a pick it up with your hands type place so no knives.  I could even handle that if there were either napkins or decent quality paper towels.  There were no napkins and there was a roll of paper on the table that wouldn't soak up water and wasn't perforated.  You just tear off a sheet wherever you can.  If I am eating with my hands, I want more than this.  There were no towelettes either.  I left sticky.  The small eating area itself wasn't clean.  This easily could be a 5 star review but there needs to be improvement in the services.  It is a much better takeout place than eat in.",

God sauce and Fallen Angel sauce are so amazing; the perfect amount of heat with the perfect amount of lots of flavor. I've had pretty much everything off the menu but my favorites are the pork ribs, beef short ribs, brisket and corn with that delish rubbed flavored butter. Did I mention how the meat falls into your mouth, so moist and flavorful Oh my.... Let's talk about the catering, I had my birthday catered for about 20 people of family and friends and everyone fell in love just as much I was. I also pick up lunch here for me and my co-workers and they are in love as well. Prices are awesome and so are the portions. If you want to support a True local that just so happens to have amazing food look no further than Jessie Rae's.",

They have only been open for about a year and a half but have been voted the best BBQ in Vegas the last 2 years. The restaurant has 3 tables inside and the location is off the beaten path, but to me those are the things that make it great.

    "text": "There aren't a lot of great BBQ places in Las Vegas. To be honest, the best brisket in Vegas is in the Caesar's Buffet, which should tell you something. Jessie Rae's is a bit of a diamond in the rough.  Went for lunch, the wait was reasonable but the location is small. There are two picnic benches outside, but you probably want to grab an go unless you have the time.  The Duke and the Big Belt Buckle are both great served over waffle fries. Good sauce, decent meat to starch ratio, and a pretty hefty portion.  The sides are pretty solid as well, the corn is amazing, the green beans are green beans and the mac and cheese leaves something to be desired but is a solid dish for a colder day.  As most have said, the sauces are good. The God Sauce is amazing and has a great balance to the sweetness, the Fallen Angel is not for the faint of heart (if you don't say to people \"I like spicy\" don't try this sauce), and the Carolina style sauce should remind you of good East Coast BBQ (assuming you believe that exists).  Now to the most important part, the meats:  1. Brisket - solid brisket, sliced in relatively thick chunks. Good smoke development and usually a fattier cut (seems like the didn't trim off as much as other places to, the flavor thanks them for this). Not great bark though.  2. Pulled Pork - Another solid meat. The juiciness and the texture is what you want from a pulled port, very soft but not chewy. The flavor is somewhat lacking and probably requires sauce (not that you wouldn't just opt for the great sauce anyways).  3. Ribs - These are the best part. Honestly, they fall off the bone and taste spectacular. I got the three meat plate just so I could try the ribs, and the only thing I realized afterwards was I should have gone three meat just ribs. If you're a fan of ribs, you want some of these, stop looking at those sandwich options, get the ribs.  4. Burnt Ends - I'm really sorry to say, this is the low point of the menu. Not only is there a significant upcharge for the burnt ends, but they just aren't True burnt ends. Some places trim the bark and call those burnt ends, most places don't even try, the burnt ends here are just smaller pieces of the end cap. NO bark, NO juicy/fatty goodness. Do NOT fall in the trap of getting burnt ends (see above, just get ribs).  5. Chicken - Wasn't able to try the chicken, but if everything else is any reflection of the quality, this should be good.  Service: This was pretty excellent. The people were great and the food came out in a reasonable time.  Side Note: if you hop around back you can see a more traditional smoker and a pretty big Traeger. I'm willing to be that these key ingredients keep things pretty moist and flavorful. Big plus.",

The sandwich didn't have an overbearing sauce so I tasted the amazing rub flavor and the unique bread was some of the finest on the strip . The potato mash w Bbq sauce was ideal. I love potatoes with some of the skin left on so this won me over.  You can choose from either a god award winning sauce or fallen angel with the reaper \"hottest pepper in the world\". There's def something for everybody and I will be back. This is now my fav new Bbq place in Las Vegas! Thank u Jessie Rae your the best!",

They have all the usual things BBQ places have pork, brisket, chicken, ribs etc. I decided to try something different, one their loaded combo's  - the Maniac fries (waffle fries, Mac N Cheese, loaded with Pulled pork & Hot links) - It was good! Pulled pork was very tender, smokey flavor, Mac was cheesey and links were add bonus - but what this place has that is different was there sauces - The Reaper / Fallen Angel (a hot, spicy- sweet sauce), God sauce is the regular BBQ sauce, but the Bama Slama white sauce was the king. Sandwiches like Jessie Mac looked good, a friend let me try  the rib tip -which was moist and tasty. Now I need to go back and try the rest -with all three sauces. A must try in Vegas!",

And was sad there wasn't baked beans..... but DAMN the food was good. I got the pulled pork sandwich which I thought was good but what hit out of the park was the short rib! There was no way to be prepared for this huge melt in your mouth piece of meat!!!! The seasoning was great! I mean it was sooooo tasty!!! The brisket was good too! For sides we had tater tots and Mac n cheese..... we got the opportunity to say hello to beautiful family who owns the place. Only negative for me was that I was sitting right under a vent and was freezing! But that did not take away from the tastiness of the food! Def will go back and suggest that others give it a try too! Hope they expand! Seating is very tight!",

    "text": "Jessie Rae's BBQ is practically a small shack just off the 15 near Russell, but they have a ton of meat. Coming in on Veteran's Day since the place is only up from the morning til 4 on the weekdays, I wasn't surprised to find out they had run out of a number of meats.  I did get to try the brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips, but I really did want to try some baby back and beef ribs (the latter of which is not available every day). Confusing as it is, they are also open on alternating Saturdays. The BBQ I did get to try was quite good. The quality of the brisket stood out, as well as the taste of the rib tips. Pulled pork works well with their sauces, which is really the highlight of Jessie Rae's. The God Sauce, ironically, is my least favorite because it is quite sweet. I enjoyed the hot sauce and the vinegar heavy sauces much more. They were probably the tastiest BBQ sauces I've ever had.  The sides were just okay for me here. Because someone hadn't picked up their order, I got to try some green bean casserole, waffle fries, and corn. I had expected corn on the cob but got some corn in clarified butter instead which came out a little too heavy. The green bean casserole was okay but the waffle fries were probably the best, but nothing particularly special.  Service here is friendly and being a small joint makes it have some of that charm that gets lost at big BBQ place. I definitely hope I can come by and get some baby back and beef ribs sometime soon.",

I got the hotlink sandwich w/ a side of macaroni and cheese. My coworkers ordered ribs, and BBQ chicken meals w/ the same pick up time, yet they had to wait for my order after receiving theirs. The sandwich was pretty good, but the macaroni and cheese could've used some seasonings (onion salt, garlic powder, paprika...something). I would consider having their hotlink sandwich again. However, I was really grossed out by how DIRTY the containers my food came in were! It looked like whoever served my Mac n cheese was handling the food from the grill with their bare hands and never washed them. The container my sandwich was in was greasy and had drip marks on it. Not only was my food not ready at the time selected on the app, but it was filthy!",

The bad thing about coming for late lunch is most of the good stuff is out. They only open for lunch service and am sure since small operation just started up might make limited amount everyday The owner assume telling me the sausage one of the first things to go. =(( Talk about mouth watering description making the sausages fresh everyday incasing them and the whole works. Really nice! More times then not see sausage on the menu it not in house made fresh everyday. I feels like speaks volumes about not just the sausage but talking about my pulled pork sandwich I ordered. You can tell the amount of passion the owner has for bbq and love that in any business owner more less small business owners just starting up. I love talking about food.   So the pulled pork sandwich (We Porked in Vegas) talk about hearty sandwich. You know its hearty when the meat is overflowing from the bun and the cole slaw on top doing the same. The names they have for the dishes I think is pretty cool idea. The natural dripping added another flavor and brings it all together. I reading about the God Sauce. I feel like totally legit. I honestly put that up there with just by itself! Top bbq sauces of all time. The other two sauces honest thought was ok but the GOD sauce. You need make sure get some when come visit. It had little kick but just the right about of balance that not pure heat in bbq sauce. The waffles fries was good. I really the enjoyed the seasoning that was on it.   Say hole in the wall. There was no cars in the parking lot when pulled in. I walk in no one at the cashier stand no one around. I see bell ringer like checking in hotel or something. It felt odd for me hit it. Not very long then someone think owner came out of the kitchen. I told him first time explaining me the menu. I went with the pulled pork sandwich. He went back made it served me and cashier. Now if that not small business?? What is?? The place only has two tables of four and three bar stools. So if planning on eating in all about timing or just order food to go. No fountain machine. The drinks not sure since came late if full selection. You pick something out of stand up refrigerator. I had iced tea. They do make three fresh gallons of different juices or something that pour into cup. I forget the names of them. I just got bottle drink. The prices are very reasonable and get great portion. Not sure about the sides. I never really notice much of selection. Everything was new too me.   Not doubt plan on coming back really want try some of the sausage. I know there been push of bbq joints around Vegas. I love this small hole in the wall places that not about environment. Food stand out. The owner has passion for bbq, friendly, and really looking forward trying more of the menu. Only reason not five stars is only tapped the surface of the food here although really more like 4,5 stars. If in the area or not got come out try Jessie Rae BBQ.",

My sister got the Duke fries with a side of cole slaw and I got the two meat combo with spare ribs, chicken and Mac n cheese. The sides were pretty good, but nothing extraordinary... Typical choices for BBQ joint, I guess we like our southern BBQ with some greens. My sister enjoyed the fries and noted how they definitely don't skimp on the meat. For me the chicken and ribs were pretty average as far as the meat and cooking go. We both agreed that the draw for this place is definitely the sauces. We really enjoyed mixing the Fallen Angel and the God sauces.  All in all it's pretty average BBQ for us... Better than Famous Dave's but not quite up there with the best",

They were out of sausage and chicken (next time we better go earlier), so we got the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs, with coleslaw as our side. Mike also recommended the pulled pork sandwich and we didn't hesitate to get that too because we were starving.   Everything was delicious, I mean everything. Usually when I go to BBQ restaurants there's always a food item that I wouldn't order again. But here, I would order everything again. The ribs were smoky and fell off the bone, the pulled pork was extremely juicy, and the brisket was cut thick. The different BBQ sauces they had were a perfect addition to the meats. My boyfriend ate the whole pulled pork sandwich without giving me a bite so in guessing it was amazing too. They even have grape Kool-Aid, sweet tea, and strawberry lemonade.   They only opened a week ago and some days they have a line out the door... Yup, I would totally wait in line for this BBQ! Even in the 100 degree Vegas heat",

The taste is amazing, fall apart aspect of the meat, great sauces, the Q paper goods. It has a at home feel to it. I've never been here before but the people helping spoke to us like they've known us from prior visits which is great. I came in thinking it was just normal BBQ items but there was much more and a huge variety of choices.! I will DEFINITELY be back to try different things.! I'm glad I searched and took a gamble on this place cause the payout was amazing.! Just go try for yourself.",

I opted for the maniac fries which were the right choice covering all the bases with fall apart brisket and covered in their home sauces. The entire menu looked delicious and the rest of the plates at our table were licked clean. The staff is incredibly nice and serious about their BBQ. I'm already looking forward to my next Vegas trip so i can crush some of the best BBQ I've had in all my global travels. 10/10.",

Before I tried this place I thought rolling smokes was the best but this place blew it out of the water. every sauce has its own flavor They even have a white BBQ sauce which I've never seen before. The meat is tender juicy and smoky. My girl who isn't a big meat fan even loves this place so that's saying something ! Her comment was and I quote 'this place is scary good' My stomach has never been so satisfied, and their cornbread has this maple butter on top which is out of this world amazing.",

So then fine, whatever he was busy, I guess. Then about 3 minuets passed, another couple went in and as soon as he saw them he jumped into cashier mode and took their order!! Tf, right I know!! S'all good.. strike two though. So then he finally got my order, paid and as I was entering in my email address (just so he doesn't have to print out a receipt)... he cancels it! This guy got me p.o. the whole time I was there... darn good thing his bbq spot is closest to our home.. that's the ONLY reason why we order our bbq at this small cramped up bbq joint with unreasonably priced food!!  Looking for a better southern style bbq spot with better customer service here in Las Vegas, if you know one, help a sister out!!",

Cole slaw was ok, wasn't bad just had a strange texture but tasted fine.  Only issue which was rectified was I ordered To go and was missing one of the meats. If had Gotten all the way back to my hotel would have been a bigger issue for me but couldn't take the tasty smell in my car and at the light was going to pick a piece of brisket and oh oh. They forgot to give it to me. Called and they asked if I was far away, went back and had it ready with plenty of apologies. When handing out to go orders might be a good idea to verify it's complete. Nothing will upset a client like missing food.  Just my suggestion. I will be back but will double check my order before leaving.",

Now I don't eat all that much BBQ and I contribute that to how picky I am about BBQ sauce, also if I'm eating BBQ it better be brisket. One of my first jobs was at Tony Romas so I don't get too excited for ribs.  I ordered a two meat combo and a Pulled Pork sandwich no Cole slaw for my fiance. He always orders pulled pork sandwiches and said this one was really tasty. The brisket was cooked really well and was so tender. I also got the baby back ribs and they fell right off the bone. I know you're wondering how the sauce was and their original is now one of my favorite BBQ sauces of all time! I would recommend you make this spot your next BBQ destination!",

    "text": "Finally got myself over here to check out this, fast becoming famous, joint.  It's the 2017 Las Vegas Gold Winner for BBQ.  In a town that is now being able to pride itself, to some extent, on its barbecue (see, for example, John Mull's, Rollin' Smoke, Sin City BBQ, et. al), Jessie Rae's earns its place among the best.  Like the other top Vegas offerings, Jessie doesn't stand on ceremony.  What you are getting here is honest-to-goodness barbecue, no froufrou, hipster bro (with a man bun), quaintness.  You will find really regular folks here who are not trendy foodies.  (BBQ, btw, is like super trendy everywhere in the U.S. right now, so it bears noting).  The minute you come in you are embraced by the serious smoky and sweet odors wafting your way.  The service is friendly and sincere, and engaging.  The environment is nothing to speak of--again, a True BBQ joint!  Round and square tables this way and that, with red and white checkerboard plastic table cloths, mismatched chairs (including one that seemed to have a hole in it), and random posters and funny placards on the fake paneled wall.  A couple TVs were playing \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.\"  You don't come here for the atmosphere.  The food.  Quite worthy of its title.  The brisket was tender and flavorful.  The chicken was not dry! (This is my own personal taste test for a BBQ joint).  The pulled pork was also not dry, with a nice balance of seasoning.  Both the chicken and the pork were well livened up with the amazing BBQ sauce that you get a big cylindrical container of.  Go for it! I selected the mild, and it was perfect.  Truly something special.  The BBQ pork ribs did not need the sauce, nor the hot link, which was my favorite.  I really dug that hot link, y'all.  It was spicy, but not so much that the heat overpowered the flavor.  To cool it down, I ate some of the delicious beans that came as a side.  Wow, they were good.  I pretty much \"hogged\" these at the table.  I also enjoyed the thick pieces of white bread that came with. (Yeah, I'm off keto).  The corn and mac and cheese were respectable, too.  It's a little on the pricier side, to be honest.  Yes, we got a lot of food (see the photos).  But it came to $70.00 with the tip.  I would have expected it to be about $15-20 less, especially with the \"special,\" which we got from checking in on Yelp.  (We pay about $55-60 for the same, comparable portions, with tip, I think, at Rollin Smoke and Sin City BBQ).  But I understand that's not out of range, and they have a proper chef, and have to pay their rent, too.  And I am glad that we went.  It's not your neighbor's backyard bbq, that's for sure!",

This is always our first stop any time we visit the city. We have always received the best service. Even more important the best food. Words can't describe how good this place is. God sauce is an accurate description of the heavenly bbq sauce they create. I typically eat an embarrising amount of food here, because it's impossible to decide on one thing. I am hours away from entering heaven on earth again. Can't wait!!!",

    "text": "I kept seeing friends check into this spot and the pictures they were posting literally had me drooling. I had to try it out.  After browsing the menu for a bit, I called in an order for pickup. I  spoke with James who was very pleasant. He took my order and told me it would be 10-15 minutes. Jessie Rae's is approximately 2.6 miles from work, so I jumped in my car on my lunch break on 2/15/16 and headed over. If you have any kind of navigation device on your phone it will lead you right to the place. Yes, it's small and the location is in a commercial complex, but there is visible signage from Valley View. Matter of fact it's right off Valley View and Dewey.  ANyway I ordered a 2 meat combo, and went with the sausage and brisket. The combo comes with one side and I choose slaw, but opted to get an additional side of mac and cheese.   The Good -Customer service was great. As I said James was very pleasant both over the phone and in person when I picked up my order. He hand delivered the food to me and showed me the food before closing up the box. You can tell he takes pride in what he does. -The pig sweat bbq sauce was amazing. It's a vinegar based sauce which happens to be my fav, and it was fucking delicious. It was so good that  I drank it out of the little cup (don't judge me). -The sausage was really good. It was chopped up into bite size pieces, perfect for popping into my mouth. It was a bit well done but that is actually how I prefer it. It had just the right amount of spice and a lot of flavor. I would order this again. The slaw-oh em gee this shit was amazing. It was tangy and creamy and the cabbage was fresh and had a nice crunch to it. I would order this again. -The price was super reasonable. I ordered a 2 meat combo and 2 sides for around $17.50.   The Bad -The mac and cheese was not good. Although it looked tasty, it tasted like when you were younger and your mom would make you eat reheated Kraft mac and cheese the next day. It was very dry and had a lot of pepper mixed throughout. I can't see myself ordering this again. -The brisket. Contrary to other reviews this brisket was not dry at all, in fact it was very tender and had good smoky flavor. While it was tasty, it was very fatty. You will have to see my pic to understand what I mean. I would think twice about ordering this again.   All in all though I think this place is pretty good. I love supporting local businesses and there are a few things I want to try out like the ribs and pulled pork. I will for sure be back.",

I recently ate there and loved the food. I especially enjoyed the beef rib which had a great taste and texture to it.   Reading through the negative reviews of the place are typically people complaining about the location, delivery, and the look of the place. Most great BBQ is found in not so great locations.   If you are looking for a sit down restaurant for BBQ with waiters etc, I don't think this is where you want to go. If you want great tasting BBQ, then this is the place to go.",

I was a little put off when I saw the prices, but I wasn't going to judge them on that after seeing the good reviews. While we waited for the food to come, we tried the sauces which there are 3 of...absolutely amazing. I got the Mcdowells Mic Ribb, my wife and son got the Jessie Mac. I got a side of mac 'n cheese and my son got a side of bbq mash, those sides alone were fantastic. Now let's get to the good stuff, my sandwich had deboned baby back ribs that were incredibly tender, no fat and sweet; the sandwich was perfectly sweet and smokey. My wife and sons pulled pork with brisket had no fat and were packed with meat. After hearing them moan, I tried a bite and it was so tender and juicy. We will for sure be coming back and next time, I'll remember the pics.",

It's a BBQ joint so it isn't fancy at all so don't be discouraged by the decor because the food is pretty good.  I personally think he prices were a bit high for what we were served and the guy that took our order was a bit short with us as we tried to figure out the menu.

This place is the BEST  normally we do the High Roller which is 2 meats and 2 sides. The brisket, chicken and pulled pork are all so amazing. Brisket is probably my favorite smoked meat! Tonight we got something new and different! It's called The Fortress! It's an order of maniac fries, which is a mixture of waffle fries, your choice of chicken, pulled pork or brisket, mac and cheese, and hot link sausage. This is all in the center and a rack of baby back ribs surrounds it. Definitely plenty to share portion wise, my man, my 1 year old son and I all shared it. As far as sides go our favorite is the corn with smoked butter. I don't even really like corn if it's not on the cob but this place does corn right  I'd eat that corn all day, honestly. The mashed potatoes are amazing and topped with something called Alabama Sauce,  its white and is sort of like a different style bbq sauce. It's delicious.",

People were super nice and it smelled great walking in the door.  A bit pricey for lunch, but what the heck, I am treating myself today.  So I ordered the 2 meat platter with pulled pork, Brisket and a side of beans.  It came to $18.67.  I couldn't wait to taste it as it smelled amazing in the car.  I get to my shop open up the platter and start and it was literally 40% pure fat.  I am not super picky and understand there will be some fat on BBQ, but this was excessive and I felt it was purposely hidden under the 2 lean slices I received.  The pork I had to go through and pick out big chunks of fat.  The beans and the meat I did get tasted great.  But when your spending $20 for a BBQ plate I don't want to have to throw half of it in the garbage . Oh well back to Dickey's.",

It's hard to say which BBQ place in Vegas is the best after this but this is a serious contender. If Yelp offered .5 star reviews this would be a solid 4.5/5....  I had the three meat combo with:  Brisket - spices on it are good   Baby Back Ribs - fall off the bone and so tender...fire  Rib Tips - so tender, so flavorful, so good and i don't even fuck with pork like that  Mac & Cheese - pretty good however the best I have had  Cornbread - the butter on this was flames...had to be brown sugar and something  Sauces were such boss. That Fallen Angel sauce ain't that spicy but has that shit that makes your soul burn slow and have the flavor that you need for some heat...  It's hard to say whether this is the best or where it ranks in Las Vegas BBQ because of me not eating BBQ in awhile however I can definitely say that it is in the top echelon of BBQ in Vegas...",

We had a two meat plate with pulled pork and pulled chicken, beans and mac N cheese. Everything was amazing. I loved the Fallen Angel sauce and the wife loved the traditional stuff, though I don't remember the name. The meat was delicious, tender and moist. Beans were great. Macaroni and Cheese stole the show though. Truly the best Mac N Cheese either of us ever had. Very creamy and stayed that way throughout the meal. Usually creamy mac gets coagulated and lumpy as it cools a little but this never stopped being creamy. Seriously, this place has now entered the must stop rotation every time we hit Las Vegas.  Saw someone get a \"fortress\" and a \"maniac fries\" on the table next to us. We will be trying the fortress next time for sure as it looked and smelled wonderful. Food so good I've already told my boss where to go when he is in the city next month. Keep up the great work. You've got a couple more customers for life in us.",

We had a 3 meat combo (brisket, smoked chicken, rib tips) with 3 sides (smoked corn, Mac n cheese, BBQ baked beans) , also got three truffles (check out the refrigerated truffle case next to the register).  Everything was really good. Super tender, you don't even really need a knife!  Paid $40 for our meal which also included 3 drinks. Super AFFORDABLE and quite frankly some of the BEST BBQ we've ever had.   Jessie Rae's is a small establishment so if you have a large party (8+) not sure if you can dine in. There's about 5 2 tops and then 2 larger tables that can accommodate 6 and the 8 people, I think. The service is awesome. Recommendations are on point.   Can't wait to go back",

Portions were a little less than I'm used to, but nothing on my plate was wasted - we ate it all! And most importantly, the food was excellent! Highly recommend.   As far as eating keto goes, we were able to achieve mostly keto approved foods. We ordered 3 meats + 1 side, and ordered an additional side. What's in the pic is brisket, chicken and hot link, and a side of Carolina red slaw as well as Vegas slaw (both were spicy and fantastic BTW).   Only grievance was we ordered 2 drinks and weren't told they were out of all but 2 of their 6 selections and they didn't offer a refund - but I didn't ask for one either. I feel they should've warned me so I could choose to pass on paying for one. Doesn't change the fact that we enjoyed our meal and it was delicious.",

    "text": "Well the BBQ craving hit hard again today and since we have a toddler we decided to be kind to other dining patrons and order delivery instead of eating in. We've ordered delivery from here once before and it was mediocre at best. I don't typically leave reviews after delivery experiences because I like to dine in before making my full assessment of a restaurant. However after a second less than stellar delivery experience, I decided to review.   Based on all the other yelp reviews and being a local joint rather than a chain, I want to like this place. Unfortunately the food just doesn't measure up.   The delivery packaging was very poor so the bag was full of grease when it arrived. Not exaggerating, all of the containers were stained orange and dripping with grease. If you are going to offer a pick up or delivery option for your patrons, you should invest in packaging that doesn't leak or wrapping the packaging in tight plastic wrap a few times is an affordable way to deliver your food in a clean and presentable fashion.   We ordered the full rack of ribs, added a few sides and the hot links. Quickly got an update that they were out of hot links so removed that from the order. Bummer.   Made a note in the order that we wanted dry rub only/sauce on the side and I added on 2 sauces for .50 cents each. When the ribs arrived the container was very greasy and the ribs were sauced. (Lightly sauced thankfully) but still not dry like I had requested. I can't comment on the taste quality of the sauces because I don't know if I received both of what I ordered or just one. It was very lightly sauced and none on the side so couldn't get a good read on the sauces. Thankfully had a bottle of bbq sauce at home to use or else I would have been really bummed.   The corn was undercooked and underwhelming. The beans were extremely mushy, not really even edible IMO, it was more of a bean mash than a cup of beans. Maybe that's the way it's intended but we didn't care for it. I've had baked beans from similar bbq restaurants before and never had ones so mushy. The coleslaw was crunchy and therefore had a good texture but very bland. I was also surprised that the meal didn't come with a roll or cornbread like most bbq joints include when you order a combo or full slab.   Sadly after two attempts and plenty of bbq competition in the Southwest, we won't order again or return.",

We ordered the bbq chicken sandwich with corn side, 2 meat combo (which comes with sides of your choice) with waffle fries and The Belt which is bbq shredded brisket on Mac and cheese!         Everything we ordered was amazing! There are different bbq sauces at your table to use with cute name... we loved *The God Sauce* so much we ended up bought 2 bottles to take home!

Since my last review (over 3 years ago), I've come in a handful of times to consistently solid food and service- friends who are fans have invited me here for various deal days (follow them on social media) and to check out new menu items (like the Fortress).  I tend to stick to their brisket as my favorite protein option, but their chicken and ribs are good too. Their mac has a good kick to it and their Maniac Fries are good to share. Sandwiches are crazy-loaded and over the top in the best way- you'll definitely leave with a full belly, a great photo to share on social media, and likely also a takeout box, too.   Staff have been great about accommodating groups despite the small location. Parking lot is also small but adjacent businesses have available space during evening visits- try to go earlier for best selection of meats though, as they often run out of popular items like ribs!  TIP: Their sauces are available for purchase, and they also offer a limited selection of desserts by Chef Malia Ploughman- save room or take them to go!",

Meat lovers will definitely mark this place as one of their top bbq spots. The sauce is also something to talk about as I had to eat it with every bite. I totally forgot what I ordered but I can tell you that there were cross cut fries in it with pulled pork, some kind of delicious sausage cuts, mac and cheese was thrown in there somewhere, gravy all over the place.. it was magical. I had to make sure to work out the next day.. totally worth it.  Come check this place out!",

This is some damn good barbecue!!!  I had the small brisket sandwich with waffle fries.  The sandwich was freaking huge and ridiculously delicious.  The waffle fries were crispy and perfectly seasoned.  I normally dislike seasoned fries but these were outstanding.   The brisket was juicy, moist, and smoky.   The slaw was crisp and tangy.  This joint is legit and you should just go here.  The next best 'que is all the way out in Boulder City.   I will be coming back to this little gem of a barbecue restaurant.",

I will be going there often before UNLV basketball games as well as UNLV football when they move to Raider's Stadium.   Update - I've eaten there about 10 times in the last 12-15 months, and have tried many different things. All have been excellent and memorable. While the decor is badly in need of a remodel, they have by far the best BBQ I have enjoyed in the LV valley!",

I added cheese to The Duke with waffle fries. The lady at cashier was super friendly. They have retained me. I might even plan a company event there. Thank you JRB! I recently order from UberEats. I've eaten here before with stellar reviews. I order my food. Excepting nothing less than exceptional since I paid $17 for fries and meat. I get my delivery and I see this...first pic in the corner. I realized, I didn't even get my extra sauce! I had four to five potato wedges. I call the restaurant and complain about the quality and my missing sauce. The lady on the phone tells me I have to take that up with the Chef. Wtf?!? Like I can just tell him to come to the phone. Worst customer service and I have talked to that lady before with no issues but yesterday I wanted to snap. I didn't because I'm not that kind of person. She said they would credit me 5 dollars. What the hell am I supposed to do with 5 dollars. The meal didn't have ranch sauce, the shredded pork was just scraps of ends no center meat. It was dry. You can clearly see the difference in the photos. I have ordered here numerous times and I never felt so disrespected! I basically gave away money because I couldn't eat.",

    "text": "This is my favorite bbq spot in the Vegas valley! Smallest bbq joint and I love that it's pretty hidden!! Definitely a hidden jewel.    I've actually bought the $31 groupon deal twice. Pulled pork, spicy sausage links, bbq chicken for two people along with 2 sides and yeast roll. So much food!! I also ordered some brisket the first time around. Let me tell you, none of those meats I've tried disappointed me. All super tender, flavorful, and good as f*ck!! Excuse my language, but yes. This place is finger lickin' yum!   Try all the bbq sauces they have out. My favorite was the original. Just enough bbq sweetness that really went well with the spicy sausage links. Also the white sauce, which I forgot what it's base is. My little sister loved that one the most and dunked every meat in that one.   We've only tried a couple sides. Had a smoked butter corn *insert heart eyes* and the waffle fries. Fresh and made to order fries.   I did this twice with this groupon and I believe thats the max you can purchase the deal but it was worth it. If you havent found this gem, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. I've already  recommended  Jessie Rae's to so many people and everyone that has gone so far, loved it!",

If you need images of dishes (since none are available on the physical menu), you can check them out online via places like here on Yelp. If you do, you will notice that it only adds to the water pouring from your mouth.   The service is pretty good. The wait for your food is a bit, but well worth it, as it delivers just as much as your expectations were waiting for. Similar to Rolling Smoke in quality, making this a stop you shouldn't miss.   They have little space inside, so it can be a challenge to sit if they are busy. Even smaller space for parking. So you might have to figure that one out as you go if it's packed outside (parking lot). Trust me though, it's worth the wait.   This visit, I had a Jessie Mac sandwich. The portion was huge and filled with meat (pulled pork and brisket) on a three-layer bun with coleslaw. It included waffle-style fries that went quite well with their tangy BBQ (they have multiple flavors to choose from) and a drink. Well worth the wait, and although I tried my best to finish it. I missed it by that much.",

Busy as soon as I stepped out, I could smell the bbq. For this day, the air had a smell of mesquite with a hint of something lighter mixed in.  Every time I travel for work, there is a good shot of my trying out the local bbq. I've tried everything except for the state of Texas and I know it's going to be good.  We ordered a little of everything. For being one of the last customers, the brisket held its juiciness and moistness. Normally brisket dries out after a few hours but this one was amazing.   The baby backs were meaty and really well done.  Normally I don't like mesquite as the bite is a stronger taste but they balanced out their smoke very well.  All the sides were great, but I found the mashed potatoes the winner as it was slightly different then your normal mashed.  Hot link had a snap and a little kick.  The options of bbq sauce let you have a taste of America.  This is now my favorite bbq joint in America which is a bit crazy to say being in Vegas of all places.   Just super happy to find this gem. I'm guessing they will outgrow the location soon and hopefully don't loose any quality as they grow as I've seen that all too often.",

Anyways they extended out and have more seating now! Mr. B sez the brisket is always great anytime we order. Cause other places it's been hit and miss lately. So when I'm in the area I gotta get brisket here. Sliced. And me being the Flexitarian,this is my #1 spot when I eat red meat!   The bbq sauces are THE BEST! So happy they sell huge sizes of the God Sauce.  Service is awesome! Mike and his family and staff rock. Mike's mom is the one usually there taking orders and serving us! Genuine people (insert heart emoji)   My family who visited from out of town still talk about coming here again when they're in Vegas.   Jessie Rae's still on Valley View near Russell. Parking in the small lot is a PITA when it's busy, but there's spaces available in surrounding area.",

    "text": "Wow, Jessie Ray's BBQ was part of the Pigs for Kids charity bbq Championship at Craig Ranch Park.  I purchased bbq from several places at the festival and theirs was by far the best.  Jessie, her husband and the rest of the staff were all very nice.  We had the pork sandwich along with some ribs.  Every was great and the Fallen Angel bbq sauce was fantastic.  They told their story on how they started a business and shared their mission and vision.  It is great they have to get a bigger smoker because they are constantly selling out.  We will be sure to visit the actual store when we are in the area.    I already know they food and atmosphere will be worth the drive.",

Pulled pork was fatty, chicken was okay, brisket was decent (but not great), but none were hot when served and the sides we ordered (Mac and cheese, bbq mashed potatoes, waffle fries, corn and baked beans) were mediocre at best. Unless you want to roll the dice on food poisoning and spend your whole meal swatting away flies, I would not recommend. Staff was very nice, but I will never go back.",

    "text": "The three of us have no idea how this place received the rating it has received. For us, it was dreadful, and we will not return, nor will we recommend. My ribs were totally charred, which means they had carcinogens: very dangerous to eat and potentially cancer causing. I showed one of the burnt ribs to the woman at the cash register, and she brought me one new rib; I had ordered three ribs. The one new rib was charred too. They charge $5.75 for each beef rib, which makes it more expensive than a top rated fine bar-b-q restaurant at the District. One in our party ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and he said it was awful. He ate the meat and left the thick bun; it was mostly bun with not much meat. We paid over $51.00 for three people with only one drink, which included a 15% tip for the server, but there really is no service at all. You order and pay at the cash register, and the server brings the food to a wreck of a table. My husband used the unisex bathroom and said it was a mess. I would give it an F grade and will tell people not to eat there. Find another place to eat in this great city!",

How nice of Findlay to go the extra mile at the holidays!!    I walked up to the outside area where the BBQ was set up.  The aroma was fantastic.  The choices were awesome.  I had the BBQ chicken and the beans.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  WOW!!!  The BBQ chicken was tender and practically melted in my mouth.  The BBQ sauce, made from scratch at Jessie's, was incredible!  There are 4 flavored choices of their sauce.  Jessie Rae's BBQ is a MUST for BBQ lovers.  If you're not a BBQ aficionado you will be after tasting theirs without a doubt!!!  I truly recommend Jessie Rae's for any catering event.  I just know your guests will be pleasantly surprised!  The two servers/cooks from Jessie's were pleasant and enthusiastic.  I really enjoyed talking with them.  They were wonderful ambassadors for Jessie Rae's BBQ.",

While a little on the luke warm side of temperature, the dish lacked nothing in delicious flavor. I wish the drink selection included something besides a 5 option soda fountain and water from said soda fountain (maybe some brewed tea and lemonade since it's a BBQ joint), and who doesn't love something sweet after all that savory meat (I'm thinking banana & nilla wafer pudding). Overall a great little BBQ joint in an unsuspecting part of town, with warm, friendly service, albeit a bit cramped inside with all the loyal customers who feel compelled to return. Plus with a delightful slogan of \"It's All About the Butt\", I definitely recommend Jessie Rae's BBQ!",

At first  the description of the maniac fries sounded like someone that was pregnant had to of come up with these but after having them let me just say there is no shortage of meat on them the sausage is out of this world good and the of combination  waffle fries, mac & cheese, sauce, brisket, and all the other goodies  is off the charts good! My hats off to the creative genius that put that combo together.   This establishment is always busy which to me is a good thing because it means not only is it good but the food is fresh. I would never be upset over a place being too small because it has been my experience that I would rather not have a business owner that has a passion for food waste his gifts on the size and looks of the place and would rather them just serve awesome food in a clean restaurant and thats exactly what you get here. The delivery was really slow but I can't say that it would cause me to not order online if I needed to.   Overall yummy, good tasting, good quality, great sized portions for the price. We will be back!",

Fallen Angel was by far the best BBQ with the right amount of heat, so we went on to buy a bottle for the house. (We now use it on pretty much everything) After trying the cornbread, me and our one year old son were all about it! I had asked to purchase another one for my son when we were on our way out the door, but the man at the counter handed me one on the house for our little man. He really loves the cornbread and I can't wait to come back for our next visit! Thanks for the hospitality you guys, great food and great service",

We definitely stood in line and waited quite a while (almost an hour!) for food & ended up being able to take it home. Well let me say it was definitely worth the wait it was really good. We ordered a 2 meat and 3 meat combo. We had baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, Hot links & barbecue chicken. I loved all of the meat it was very well seasoned and cooked very well. Their barbecue sauce was good had a little kick to it. We ordered sides of the corn, mac & cheese, coleslaw and some corn muffins. The corn and mac & cheese were just average. Really liked their coleslaw and the cornbread was a little hard. All in all the barbecue food was really great and we will be back since it's so close to the house!",

BBQ sounded good, so we ordered two 2 meat combos. We got an extra order of chicken but the pork beans we ordered were missing. Disappointing, but the food was so delicious it was like whatever, and I quote: \"Now we have an excuse to go in and try it!\" Best pulled pork I've ever had, amazing brisket, and the ribs are nuts.

    "text": "*NOTE*: Dog-friendly patio!!!!  Absolutely divine barbecue! Having lived in Lexington, KY and a Savannah, GA, I know my way around great barbecue, and the folks at Jessie Rae's are right there at the top!  This is easily **The Most Tender Brisket** I have EVER tasted!  But the real treat is the \"What-The-Hell-Is-This\" deliciousness of the Maniac Fries: an \"American Picnic Nachos\", if you will, of waffle fries, Mac-n-Cheese, hot links, and your choice of an additional barbecue meat. We chose to add the pork, which was great, but next time we will use the brisket.  Although the barbecue stands on its own, be sure to treat yourself to some of the \"Slammin' Bamma\" white (yes, I said white!) barbecue sauce! It's indescribably fantastic.... Amazing flavor!  Jessie Rae's is now in my normal rotation of restaurants to visit, and without a doubt on the \"must have for lunch\" list when friends and family come to town.   Bonus points for being a restaurant that supports national veterans charities and local firefighters.   Second bonus: this is a great place to hit for lunch before or after going guns & ammo shopping at Ventura Firearms, which is one block to the south.",

    "text": "Theres few things more comforting a good plate of pulled pork or brisket covered in a sweet and tangy bbq sauce.  This place is a family owned local spot.  It was hard to find as it is off by itself.  Show up early as we bought what was left over for the day (which was still amazing) when we showed up around 7 pm.  The staff are friendly and carry a lot of pride in their product. The food is not cheap however I would say it is the best quality and flavor bbq in Vegas I have tasted so far (I have been the The Shed in MS).  The serving size and quality make up for the price.  Once you get the plate, grab different types of bbq sauce which are on the table and dig in.  \"God sauce\" was my favorite. They also  have a Spicy Reaper, Bama white, Carolina vinegar and Carolina yellow mustard version bbq sauces (most PC bbq joint I've been too). The food here reminds me of getting a plate of bbq in Florida, MS, Georgia,  or Carolinas (Texas in regards to the brisket).  If you are from the South, this is the place to be.  Place is casual so wear shorts and a dark shirt as this place carries a high risk of staining your favorite shirt.  Theres a 10% military discount.  Conclusion: show up early and bring your appetite.",

Their ribs are tender and smoked to perfection and not spicy unless you add one of their homemade spicy sauces which is perfect since my wife doesn't like spicy food. This is a must stop if you are in town and it's just on the other side of the freeway from Mandalay Bay and the strip. A $5 uber well worth it to get some great local Vegas bbq if you are on the strip. #GoKnightsGo",

Inside it is small and there aren't very many tables, but by the time we ordered our food there was a table that opened up. They have expanded some, so there's at least more places to sit than before. Hole in the wall bbq is the best way I can describe Jessie Rae's after walking inside and honestly I wouldn't want any less. Inside was clean and there were different bbq sauces on the table all of which were good. I recently came by with a group of friends for dinner and they were giving half off the entire menu (just for that evening) to celebrate their Best of Las Vegas win. Nice!   Three Meat Combo ($19.99) - Pick 3 meats or triple up on your favorite. This combo includes one side. The pulled pork has been inconsistent when I've visited as far as flavor, texture and look. The hot links are tasty with a nice kick of flavor. It's the brisket though that shines. Tender, juicy and flavorful brisket can be chopped per your request should you like.  Jive Chicken ($8.75 regular size) - Waffles fries piled with smoked hand-pulled chicken? Sign me up! The waffle fries had just the right crispness and held up all the toppings well. The chicken had a great flavor and was well l liked by others in my group also.   The Belt Buckle ($11.25 regular size) - This is like the Jive Chicken, but we asked for tater tots instead of waffle fries on this one. The tater tots were crispy, tasty gems. The brisket was piled high they did not skimp. The tots really did well holding up the juicy brisket. This with either the tots or waffle fries would be a great thing for a group to share and they have a larger size also.   Corn with Smoked Butter ($2.75) - This sounded better than it was. The corn wasn't bad, but it honestly tasted like corn from a can that was heated up in butter.   BBQ Beans ($2.75) - I ate every bite of these beans the first visit and did the very same on the next. They drizzle a bit of bbq sauce on the top of the beans and I could have eaten another side because these beans oh my they were so good!   Mac and Cheese ($2.75) - The first time I came the mac and cheese was very good. This last visit the mac n cheese wasn't at all the same taste or texture. I'd have rather doubled up on beans! Maybe it was just an off night for the mac and cheese since they were so busy, so I won't rule it out again in the future.   They have a variety of sandwiches on the menu and mini cobbler for dessert. There's a private parking lot, but when it gets busy cars park on the street at the side of the building.",

At first I thought my parents were overhyping this little business but it turns out they didn't. My boyfriend and I got a pulled pork sandwich then my parents got a full rack of ribs. The pulled pork was just nice and juicy, knowing myself and how picky I am with pulled pork I was highly satisfied with it. The ribs were amazing as well! The Mac n cheese tasted homemade that I just couldn't have enough of it. Their sauces they carry are amazing, especially the highly recommended \"God Sauce\".  I would easily recommend this place to everybody!",

Half the meat on the sandwich was white fat and no soda came with it.  No BBQ sauce.  Three-Meat platter-has specific instructions to have extra extra BBQ sauce on the side.  Came with a tiny small container of BBQ sauce.  Two-Meat container-came with no sauce  I called them and was explained there was already sauce on the meat.  Last time I checked, who goes to a BBQ place and does not use lots of sauce?  Very disappointed.  Going to eat this pretty dry.  Won't go back again.  I would rather spend my $$$ at Rollin Smoke.",

Generous sides included were corn, coleslaw AND baked beans - all were 5 stars!! We added Mac n cheese and it was also excellent. The rib meat was so tender and falling off the bone, the brisket was flavorful and perfect, the chicken was the bomb also. Oh, I don't want to forget about the sauce..... it is called ' God Sauce' for a reason!! Delicious!! We had a large bottle and by the end of the day, it was all gone!! We had a happy crew for sure! Jessie Raes made planning this event so easy. From the first call,all the way to delivery, it was perfect. If you are looking for a delicious BBQ place or planning an event, you just found your place!! Call or go to Jessie Raes BBQ right now!! You will be glad you did!!!",

Had the awesome Maniac Fries (half order only)  -it was huge, filling, mac n cheese and brisket/sausage on top of waffle fries, I tried a few waffle fries before but the ones here were crispy, crunchy and seasoned, one of the better.                                I tried samples of meats through friends pulled pork/brisket were both tender and flavorful, ribs were tasty. The Sandwich the Jessie mac was huge w/ brisket & pulled pork double decker, it was loaded and high -I had to used a fork & knife for help. What made Jessie Rae's different is the sauces they have to go with the food, sauces like The God Sauce, Slammin Bama and spicy Fallen Angel sauce -all great on everything, My favorite was Alabama and god sauce mix, on waffle fries, brisket, pork on top of cole slaw. I will be back soon.",

Another customer ordered something called Maniac Fries and they looked great.   I ordered a two meat combo with bbq mashed potaoes,  and my buddy got 3 meat with house made mac n cheese.  I made sure to get ribs and pulled pork,  since any good bbq place should do those well.    The food was amazing.  Literally melt off the bone... And the sauces were great.

The lady at the register was very abrupt, rude, aggressive and interruptive. I had barely taken my last bite when she reached across the table and took our food, while asking if we were finished. I would have given this place a higher rating if it wasn't for the customer service.",

I called in my order of pick 3 with ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  I wanted to try the sausage but they didn't have it that day.  For sides I picked mac n cheese and baked beans.  I arrived a little after 11 and they were already slammed.  The man I guessed to be Mike was handling everything with ease.  Phone orders, people dining in, communicating with the kitchen.  He did it all while still greeting and chatting with guests.  Great customer service.  After a torturous drive home I dug into some of the best bbq I've had in Vegas.  All the meats were delicious.  Ribs were my favorite.  They need to bottle and sell their sauce.  It's that good.  I was a little disappointed in the sides though.  The mac in cheese didn't have much flavor and the beans tasted like canned pork and beans but with no pork in sight.   Maybe they use that as a base and I got the unfinished version?  Or just an off day?  Whatever the case I'll be back.",

Any place that bothers making their own sauces proves that they care about the food they serve. Do yourself a flavor favor and put Jessie Raes in your face. Only criticism is the Mac & cheese is soggy. Good work everyone.",

The brisket was very tender but was so greasy that it didn't have a good flavor. All I could taste was the grease. It also was inedible. I threw away the brisket and the chicken. They didn't have water in the place at least in the front section and the cooler was just about empty. The beans were good but that's about it. Maybe I got in on a bad day.

The best BBQ ribs we've had in years. The pulled pork just melts in your mouth... both were so juicy and tender. We actually didn't expect to find anything as good as this in Vegas, but we did. The sauce is what makes or breaks the BBQ and Jesse Rae's BBQ is the place for BBQ. As for the brisket, we prefer a little bit more marbling, but flavor was good. Just a little warning, they only have 4 tables. Suggest that you take out if the place is packed.",

It's hard enough having to keep a stash of napkins with you just about everywhere you go, but trying to explain that the spot of sauce on your lapel came from another disappointing attempt at barbeque in this town is about as heartbreaking as it gets. Somedays, I wish I could just go back home to Texas.   Jesse Rae's is not one of those barbeque places. In fact, the meat is pretty damn good. With a few exceptions on some of Mike's selections of sides, Jesse Rae's is damn good 'cue. The Fallen Angel sauce is my favorite (despite being a Carolina sauce), but the ribs are awesome without any sauce at all.  We catered in from Jesse Rae's for about 70 people a few weeks back and I have to say Mike did a bang up job. Certainly some of the best smoked meats you will find in the valley, and if Mike keeps perfecting his technique, he is not far from  being as good as you'll find anywhere in Texas.  Keep up the good work Mike, and thanks again for making our event a great success. Everyone loved it.",

The WORST Mac n Cheese I've ever tried (1 bite was all I could stomach), tasted like the store bought, boxed, powdered mix kind, I think they must've ran out of their own & thought the box would suffice, AWFUL. Paid $2 for a 12oz glass of watered down coke, what a waste. The sauces were great but thats honestly the ONLY decent item I tried so I must admit I was shocked to see this place had 4+ stars. And No Napkins or Ketchup (which I specified in my order). Needless to say that I Will NEVER be ordering food from them again.",

Unless you're judging by sauce, then they're better by the entire race! Jessie Rae's has the bbq sauce I've tasted in my life! You put Fallen Angel on a dog turd I'd probably be able to choke it down.  I've tried most of the stuff on the menu, it's all delicious. The best thing on the menu is the maniac fries. Get it with tots instead of waffle fries, and put loads of the white sauce and fallen angel on it. Take one bite and you'll be in heaven! Make sure to get your hand stamped on the way out to guarentee reentry upon death. YES I AM CLAIMING MANIAC FRIES ARE SO GOOD YOU'RE GUARANTEED A SPOT IN HEAVEN!  Portions are generous. Prices are good ....when you consider how expensive bbq usually is. So get your ass over there.",

Jessie Rae is the boyfriend who lives in another state just to keep you interested.   Once I get over the betrayel to my schedule that is closing at 6pm, I love this place. I love the hole-in-the-wall, home town barbeque vibe. The place is really small, I didn't see a maximum occupancy sign but I assume anymore than 15 people would be some sort of fire hazard. There are only four tables covered in plastic table clothes, which is what I like in my BBQ joints! It's the down to earth backyard BBQ realness that I crave. My only complaint here is that I did not see or could not find any wet wipes or hand sanitizer. I left with my hands feeling pretty sticky which is uneccesary in our day and age of magic, one-time-use disposable hand cleaning clothes.   The loaded plate was literally everything. Tater Tots and waffle fries with cheese and pulled pork and BBQ sauce. Next time I get this I am going to ask for some sauce on the side so I can SMOTHER it. It was delicious.   The mac and cheese was good too, as well as both of the meats on my boyfriends plate. The only thing I would not get again is the green bean casserole. I thought this came out watery and the only friend onion crunch was on the top. I make green been casserole every year for my family's thanksgiving so I am some what of an expert - lol - avoid this for the other delicious sides offered by Jessie Rae's",

Each one very different and very distinct. Good amount of food for the price? Not so much. But hey, it's a tiny little house made BBQ joint, so that's to be expected. I was in there when a construction worker ordered his lunch...$18! Ouch!  We ordered the pork'd in Vegas sandwich & the Jessie Rae. Pork'd in Vegas is the clear star. Hearty, balanced. Everything you want in a BBQ sandwich. The Jessie Rae is served on sandwich style bread, very light, very airy. It had potato chips in it along with other unnecessary ingredients. I didn't think this sandwich was filling or balanced.   But the real reason why I could only give two stars....the flies. The amount of flies flying inside and landing on us as we were eating was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences ever. Even if it was the absolute best food I've ever had...even if the entire world proclaimed this place as the holy grail of BBQ, I couldn't return or even order to go...if there were that many flies in the dining room, one could only imagine what was going on in the kitchen.  Jessie Rae, best of luck to you...you make a darn good pork sandwich.",

The presentation was terrible. The size of the basket was very small for 3 meats and the fries were spread across the plate. I couldn't see what was under the fries. All the meats were wet and drizzled with some kind of sweet sauce. Anyway.. The chopped brisket was good. I wasn't expecting it to be chopped but it was still good. The rib tips were very fatty and hardly any meat on them. I know rib tips can come with some fat and cartilage but these were way too fatty. The tri tip was just ok. Very chewy and almost as if it was not cut against the grain.   Biggest complaint was that all the meats came wet with some kind of sweet sauce (maybe from the waffle fries) and the terrible presentation.  Perhaps the three meat should come on a different plate or the side should be served separate.   On a side note, all of the sauces on the table were great. But again all my meat came wet and sweet already so I didn't really get to enjoy the sauces as much.",

So I told her, I'll take the belt buckle fries, for $11.75 (listed at the bottom of the wall menu). Then the lady pointed to the menu mounted on the counter and said ok, but which combo? I was confused.... she said go look at the wall menu, you need to chose two meats, still bit confused because the fries appeared to look like they come with brisket. I was advised that I needed to select a minimum of two meats for my fries. So I ordered brisket and sausage, added a drink. Next thing I know is that my total was about $23/$24 bucks. Since I already felt like I was being pressured to order a minimum, I didn't feel like asking about the price increased, since she seemed really pushy about a minimum order for meats.  My question, are the belt buckle fries listed on the bottom of the wall menu priced without the meats? Or was this a slow day and the lady was trying to up sale/ increase sales for the day and was sold something different or different size?  I'm thinking a moderate total price for the belt buckle fries with a drink should've been around $16/17 bucks.",

    "text": "When it comes to what to have for dinner, Mom always knows best. That was definitely the case at Jessie Rae's BBQ. I was playing at tournament at the Rio when I started craving ribs. Asking the experts at the hotel - security - one name echoed enough times to send me straight to Yelp. Jessie Rae's not only came up instantly in paid ads, smart, as well as a good sign but it was also close by. And it's reviews were terrific.   My flip flop got stuck under the front door as it closed behind me and it took me three attempts to free it. \"I hate when that happens,\" the lady behind the counter said, removing my embarrassment after a clumsy entrance. Owner Mike Cross wasn't around, after all it was Sunday night, but his mother, Samantha was. \"Are you visiting, this your first time?\" She asked. I was a virgin. But If the food was good as the customer service was, I'd be luckier here tonight than at the casino.   As I eyed the menu wall, Samantha offered \"Whatever you order, you have to try the god sauce, you'll be back for more.\" I was studying the Wall, I began drooling while choosing, a good sign. The smells were teasing me. Her words still ringing in my ears, my choice got easier because I was told I'd be back. I'd try the \"Big Belt Buckle, brisket covered waffle fries covered in cheese\" and the pulled pork sandwich another time. \"Ribs, pulled pork and Mac and cheese for my side\" was my order. \"Help yourself to some sauces and I'll bag you up\", Sam advised. I chose the house BBQ, which Sam told me was the god sauce. I doubled down.   Back in my hotel room, surrounded by pig bones, mouth slathered in a mess of god sauce and rib bits, my hands sticky with it too, I'm one happy man. This is the best barbecue I've had in years, possibly ever. The meat separated from the bone as if under its own will. And the flavor? Delicious fails this food, it's too weak a word. This BBQ will make you want to slap your Grandma\" as my buddy Rusty used to say. That and \"The cook is legit,\" said Yelp reviewer MIchael R, also from Long Beach. I couldn't say it better. Just go.",

We got massive quantities of chicken breast, beef ribs, pulled pork, with corn, beans, and coleslaw for the sides.  Everything was amazing.  What I loved most was that the meat was tender, moist, and smoky and the different types of BBQ sauce were available on the side.  Even the chicken breasts were super moist.  And it was great for those of us trying to get in shape for swimsuit season as we could put as much or as little sauce on as we wanted.  I didn't try the corn or beans, although others raved about them.  I went back for 3 helpings of the coleslaw!  If you haven't tried it, this is by far the best BBQ in town!!",

When I get there, 3 hours before they close, almost everything on the menu is sold out which probably means they're that good and they had a busy day. So I ordered the spare Rib Sandwich. They basically just put 2 big slabs on with pickles between 2 buns that seemed a bit stale. Almost half of the ribs were fatty and the meat was dry and hard to chew. Thank God for the sauces that helped with the dryness. I had to breakdown the meat with my hands and remove all the fat just so I can get a decent bite. I wish they would slightly toast the bun but no. They forgot to put onions on it(which says it comes with on the menu). When I asked for the onions, the girl gave me about 8 chopped up pieces so I asked for more and another small amount of chopped onions came lol(see photos) It would've been nice to atleast offer a free drink since almost everything was sold out. I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and was very disappointed on the quality of the food and lack of customer awareness. I really hope management steps up and improves this place a bit. Would love to maybe go back one day and give it one more try. On the bright side The coleslaw was the only good thing I had",

The pulled pork was moist, yet retained a good bite and held its flavor throughout. Folks from Georgia would be reminded of home and that familiar taste of a quality roadside pork joint. Brisket was delicious, tender, well seasoned and a blend between the lean and fat. Some folks don't want their brisket chopped and demand sliced, but Im of the school of thought where taste is king and I don't care either way. Neither meats needed sauce, but you can't help but pour some on there as they are made in house and are quite well thought out. The sides we had were as expected, good compliments to the meal, but not gonna blow your mind. That's okay though, as the meat is the star of this place, owned and operated by a local young man. Desserts on hand were unique, decadent, and locally made. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to try more of the dishes.",

As soon as I walked in the smell hit me and I knew that whatever I ordered was going to be amazing.  Turns out I was right.   Everything here tastes darn fresh and homemade. This is definitely not a fast food type place.  The quality of the food is top notch and everything feels like home cooking. I went for the micrib sandwich and waffle fries.  The rib sandwich was so generous I could barely hold onto it.  Giant pieces of ribs, \"god sauce\", between two BBQ soaked buns.  What's not to like?    One of the signature experiences at Jessie Ray's is the sauces.  There's 5 BBQ sauces on every table, all of which you've gotta try!  I especially loved the fallen Angel and pig sweat; but the god sauce is most people's favorite.  Either way, all of it was amazing.  If you like BBQ I highly recommend this place!",

She asked if it was our first time there and we told her it was and she explained the menu and was super friendly. This place is laid back. We shared the Maniac fries and a 3/4 rack of spare ribs. Our friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and Mac & Cheese that she liked her Mac & cheese so much she ordered a second one after finishing her first cup. (Didn't get a shot of that)",

The chopped brisket was so tender moist & flavorful same w the pulled pork super tender moist the smokey flavors on both meats are really good. We tried all of the sauces except the spicey one the god sauce was our favorite. The waffle fries underneath was hot & crispy just right! It's a cool little place tucked a stones throw away from the new Raiders stadium & Hwy15 not a big place but just right u see all of their bbq competition trophy's next to the register it was cool! We ended up taking some home I didnt know that 1 reg order could feed like 4 people & we got 2 regular trays & it was just me & pops. Took some leftovers home for tacos or sandwiches for the week! Overall our experience here was excellent 5/5 I'll be taking friends and relatives here when they visit & we will be back no doubt about it!!!",

This says a lot since we always try different BBQ joints and this is comparable to the famous Phil's of San Diego.   Food: GET THE BRISKET!!!!! I've never liked brisket it's always so dry or flavorless but I read on yelp that this brisket is good and it's THE BOMBB!! SO TENDER! I still dream about the meat there and the God Sauce. My boyfriend and I got the baby back ribs with the brisket and we were so full! Wish I ordered more brisket but too bad it wouldn't have made it back across the state border lol  Also ordered the brisket loaded fries which were so good!!! Wish open late or else they would be great as \"late night post clubbing hangover\" food. One star away from 5 because of the portions. Please make the portions larger  because it's kind of pricey. FREE CORNBREAD IS A PLUS!! Also Mac and cheese was really good and dense. Too bad my boyfriend ate all mine.   Service: really fast service here and clean!! This is a small hole in the wall joint and there isn't much seating but who cares? THIS FOOD IS THE BOMB I CRY TAKE ME BACK PLEASE",

They arrived with the food a little earlier than planned, but that worked to our advantage. Everything was absolutely delicious. We had a huge tray of the brisket and before the night was over that tray was completely empty. Also had the pulled pork and chopped chicken. Everything was amazing, including the dinner rolls. Wow! the dinner rolls, imagine Hawaiian rolls on steroids, these things were as big as the plates and sooo good. The sides were equally as good too, especially the mac n cheese. Very creamy and cheesy, it was the co star of the night with the brisket. Everyone at the event commented on how good the food was, and many have said they will be visiting there soon.  Can't say enough good things about the whole experience, from creating the menu, placing the order, the delivery and quality of the food. it was a great experience. And let's not forget about the sauce, they gave us a huge bottle of their \"God Sauce\", their special BBQ sauce. It is delicious, a great addition to all of their meats. I highly recommend Jessie Rae's for lunch, dinner or a large group, you won't be disappointed.",

Can't wait to try more items on their menu.    Update 12-23-2018 Ordered Jesse Rae's baby back ribs tonight from Postmates.  I can't believe they let that terrible slab of meat out the front door.  90% of the rack was as dry as beef jerky.   Like I literally almost cracked a tooth on some of the meat.  Disgusting.   I guess Jesse and his wife have lost their touch.    Another one bites the dust.   Too bad, I really liked this place.   Won't return.   Guess I'm back on the hunt for good Las Vegas baby back ribs.   You'd think they'd be easier to find in a town built on food and entertainment.  Update 12-23-2018 (a few a hours after the WORST BBQ IVE EVER EATEN) Owner replies to my review \"trust me buddy, my touch has gone nowhere, and it's Mike actually\".   Must be nice to have so much business that you don't give a shit about someone who was a long time fan of your food and then had a bad experience.  Well Mike, believe me my business has gone elsewhere.   And all of my friends, colleagues and clients, will be directed elsewhere too.  This is Vegas.   Your doors will be closed in less than 5 years.  I'll give you one thing, Mike sounds much more like a guy who thinks his BBQ is better than it is.   Jesse sounds like a guy who knows how to cook.",

Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about the meat. The brisket was tender, juicy and flavorful and maybe a little bit of their award winning BBQ will enhance the flavor a bit more, though not necessary.  The rib tips, though a bit fatty, was again really tender and I expected crispy ends- but I must have mistaken.  I tried all different sauces that was offered and the award winning one tasted the most traditional and my preferred sauce. The belt buckle- with my choice of waffle fries and tots as my base, I was really disappointed that they were not crispy at all.  I did not enjoy any of the sauces that were laced over the dish, but I managed to pick out the brisket to get a better taste of it.  Next time, I'm ordering just the meat and skipping all the carbs including the sauce and adding my own.  The belt buckle reminds me of hangover food.",

The sandwiches are also as delicious as the meat combos! Get here before noon during weekdays to beat the lunch rush because there is limited seating.

Small establishment located in a tiny strip mall with limited parking but the trip was worth it as the BBQ was creative and fantastic. I went with the Household of Three sandwich which consisted of smoked pork sausage, pulled pork and beef tips served on a brioche roll with slaw and onions.  It was certainly one of the better BBQ sandwiches I've ordered and the combination, while sounding daunting, worked well together as the various barbequed meats worked nicely with each other and the spicy scotch bonnet BBQ sauce they had tableside. I tried a few of my guests waffle fries as he could not finish them and also enjoyed these.  Only reason it was not 5 stars was owing to every table we tried to sit at was filthy was sauce spills and crumbs from the previous diners.",

    "text": "Saw this place on I believe it was Fox Morning News. It looked so good on TV I wanted to see if it was all talk or the real deal. Well as you can see by my 5 star rating this place was the real deal. If your looking for legit BBQ you'll really like this place. The BBQ we ordered was smoked and seasoned perfectly. Sometimes I go to these BBQ spots and the meat looks good on the outside but ends up being dry and not so tender on the inside. BUT not this place.. it was juicy and tender and full of flavor. They offer I counted  7 different BBQ sauces you can try at your table but to tell you the truth their BBQ was good enough without any extra sauce/seasoning. Also the pricing was reasonable for what you were getting. Definitely try this place if your craving some BBQ. I'll definitely be going back! Oh and also they do catering... I'll be using that service in the future as well.",

Take out order of $35.00+ is enough food to feed a hummingbird.  Dine-in experience was the same (overpriced) except I got to witness how messy they keep the place.

Pulled chicken sandwich was not pulled it was just big pieces of bbq chicken. Tasted good tho. Loved the smoke flavor. Wish they had fried okra. The buns are soft and buttery and they bbq sauces tasted pretty good. The lady at the counter who I will leave unnamed was a character to say the least and not in a good way. The place is cluttered with junk and dirty. Needs some love and care in the FOH. Seems like they do a lot of catering and ToGo orders. Dine in was not the best experience.",

This is a very small place with about 4-5 tables and about 15 seatings. It's good for take outs.  I love their Maniac fries and I have to say their Pig Sweat Sauce is the best Carolina sauce I have had in Vegas . The other 2 sauces are Fallen Angel and God Sauce.  We also had pulled pork, ribs and cole slaw. The pork was close to the best I have ever had. It was really tender with a great flavor.  My boyfriend had mentioned about coming here the first time and talked to the owner. He said he was really nice and wanted to go back as he loved the food. This time he wasn't there but the girl at the counter was very nice.",

    "text": "OK take a look at the pics, enough said. Fine I'll make it longer.  Jessie Rae's BBQ is a small BBQ joint that you'll should try if you haven't already done so. Yea they're small 10 slim people could maybe fit inside. There were only 2 tables and a few stools on the inside and a few tables on the outside. They get busy during lunch and I've heard they do run out so come early. Got there at 11:30 am no one was there but a few minutes later it was packed.  Obviously when it comes to BBQ everyone is gonna have their favorites mines ribs and brisket and of course that's what I went with. The ribs here were tasty. It had a nice bark, a good smoke ring, and was real tender. Mmm I'm craving these ribs right now. The brisket I got were served a little cold, not sure if that's how they usually do it but would've enjoyed them warm or hot at least. Will need to try again.  If you like sauces on your BBQ they have three of them. The Pig Sweat which is their Carolina style vinegar sauce, the Fallen Angel which is their spicy sauce made from Carolina reaper peppers supposingly one of the spiciest peppers out there, and their God Sauce which I didn't get to try. Enjoyed the Fallen Angel and didn't care to much for the Pig Sweat.  They also have these things where it starts with a pile of waffle fries, mash potatoes, or mac n cheese then top it with sauces, cheese, spices, and meat. Doesn't look like its good for you but I want one.   I'm for sure going back.",

I lived in San Diego for over 27 years and honestly there was only a couple of decent BBQ places and both of them closed down.  One thing for sure this town is a Foodies paradise!  Jessie Rae's had been on my radar for some time and I finally made it to them.  We ordered to go which was a good idea as I noted how small the inside is when we walked in.  Glad I got my order to go as eating BBQ you need some space to spread out.       We got the brisket, ribs and sausage.  The brisket was in long pieces and moist, tender and smoky flavored.  This is real BBQ not the grilling BS some places call BBQ.  The sausage was slightly spicy and oh so delicious.  The ribs which were the wife's choice were fall off the bone tender and really tasty.  They have some unique sauces - we tried the sweet Carolina style and the spicy vinegar based sauce.   Both were very tasty and went well with all the meats.  The side dish we all got was the Cole Slaw and it was really good.  More of a sweet vinegar taste and not the mayo heavy type I have tried at other restaurants.       The service was good and the guy running the register was friendly and helpful despite being pretty busy.  Since it was our first time it took us a few mins to take in the menu.  He was helpful and gave us some great suggestions on items to order.  Looking forward to my next visit as this is a great spot serving up some REAL BBQ!!!",

Anyone willing to lash out and defend their food must take pride in what they serve.  Put up or shut up.  Four guys,  all solo meats (sold by the half pound) and ribs (sold by 1/3, 1/2, full rack).  Sides are not necessary and take up stomach real estate needlessly.  Brisket - Fat requested.  Nice bark, excellent smoke ring, sweet smoke flavor throughout, solid rub imparting a good seasoning, relatively moist and pull apart tender.   Beef Ribs - Good amount of meat on them bones.  Nice bark, deep smoke ring and once again sweet smoke flavor.  Great seasoning, very moist, and tender.    Pork Ribs - Beef is king but these were good.  Fall off the bone tender.  Well seasoned.  The sweet bitterness of the smoke works to increase the natural sweetness of the pork.  Though not a sauce guy, let's just say the God Sauce (sweet tomato based sauce) should be used instead of chocolate in the bedroom.  Squirt it on anything good.  The Pig Sweat (Carolina style sauce) works well with pork if you're into that.  The Fallen Angel (sweet tomato based sauce with distinct flavor and spice of habaneros) packs a kick without killing the taste buds though heightens the bitterness of the smoke.  Prices in line.  Service, friendly but no nonsense.  Go early, they do sell out.    In the end, all the fundamentals of proper low and slow BBQ are present.  A meal happily enjoyed on the hood of the car.",

When we got the they were out of Beef bones and Baby Back ribs, which is a good sign for them because at 6pm they should be out of baby backs. I asked if the hot links were made in house and they honestly said no which I give them a huge thumbs up.  I had the spare ribs, brisket and baked beans and my daughter had chicken and Mac and cheese. The meat had a great smoke ring and very good flavor. The chicken was moist and delicious. The baked beans seemed like they were from a can correct me if I'm wrong but that was how they tasted. Limited selection on beverages but its a BBQ joint not a fast food chain. They are better then any chain restaurant in town but there are a couple better ones out there (not going to give free plugs). I gave 5 stars for the meat only because that is what I was there for over all 3 1/2 stars because of the beans and at over $30 dollars after tip for two people everything should be homemade.",

Sides were tasty too, corn and chunky mashed potatoes. Owner Mike was great, asking customers how they liked the food, the lady taking orders at the register very friendly and helpful. They do run out of popular items like other people said, need to get there early in the day. We liked this BBQ so much that we bought a whole rack of ribs to bring back to San Diego! Looking forward to coming back and having it again! Good luck to the owners, hope this place does very well.",

Hearing about \"Vegas barbecue\" is something most people are skeptical about hearing, but let me tell you it's amazing. All of their fresh meat sells out quickly, because it's so juicy that it almost doesn't need their sauce, but you wanna put it on anyways since that's excellent too! The owner James served me and my family and now many of them come back on their own because they loved him and his food so much. I've had amazing southern barbecue, but lucky for me I can always swing by Jessie Rae's and feel like I'm back in the south!",

He also makes a vinegary sauce which is God sauce with a little extra vinegar tang to it which is amazing and addictive The Fallen Angel is hot and spicy for all you lovers out there then the sauce he puts on his coleslaw I do not like mayonnaise or coleslaw and the sauce on this coleslaw is so good I have never like coleslaw before all the sides are made fresh with love the meats are smoke daily the portions are unbelievably big the owner Mike Ross has a lot of passion and drive and a beautiful heart he also wins lots of awards in the west side competitions and gives plenty to charities this place is definitely worth trying once and checking it out for yourself and see if you are hooked too. It is inside cactus jacks bar on Maryland Parkway between cactus and St Rose Parkway it is open until 2 a.m. he also just added breakfast items the original location is located on Valley View and Russell it is only open during lunch time only until they run out of food in a couple hours every day so if you go to the original first location on Valley View you have to get there early because it is packed every day go check it out it's totally worth it and awesome you're not going to find any BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas that has so much heart and passion and quality and love you can taste it and feel it when you're there",

    "text": "This review is for their food, service, and catering.  First of all the food was 15 minutes late. May not seem like a lot of time. But when your business meeting starts and there is no food to serve it's a total embarrassment. Unacceptable.  Second, the delivery driver dropped the food that was in bags on the counter and bolted out the door. He didn't say 1 word to me or the others in the room. I was confused because I thought he was coming back. But he never did. Unacceptable.  Third, I began unpacking the food from the bags. First bag was a 7 ft long roll of brown paper towels. I guess they don't give you napkins when order their BBQ. They just pull the handle on the roll of brown bathroom paper towels. Unacceptable.  Fourth, they packed the food in Styrofoam containers. Not aluminum trays. I thought this was weird. Never have I ordered catering and gotten Styrofoam containers that you typically get when you get a doggie bag at the actual restaurant. Unacceptable and very unprofessional.  Fifth, the food was all crushed from being in Styrofoam containers. Baked beans were literally spilling out the edges and onto the bag and counter. The mac n cheese also was mostly in the bag and not the container. Unacceptable.  Lastly, the food was just not that good and my business associates were extremely disappointed in the overall presentation and service provided. The last straw was the bbq sauce. They literally gave me approximately 10oz of bbq sauce for 10-12 ppl. It wasn't enough for everyone to get some. So some people got dry unflavored meat. Unacceptable.  Please use caution when ordering from this restaurant.  EDIT:  Here is the response from the owner. Great customer service...no apology, no trying to make it right. Just blaming it on the customer. Nice work guys...nice work.   5/27/2017  First this review is because you didn't get to eat because you though the food had glouton in it and it didn't and I told the stooge you had call me that.  I would have resolved the other issue them. So let's break this down  15 minutes late. I am sorry. Give us more notice before larger catering and we will be more prepared. We did our best with the time given.  We are slow smoked bbq not McDonald's a   We have an option for set up if you want it.  It's was not ordered.  You ordered. Just delivery.  That's what you got.   Those rolls are not from the bathroom. We use them on our tables like most bbq restaurants do  Sorry you thought something was weird. It's what we do and never have had an issue.  An opinion like this is hardly basis for a review   We are very sorry for it spilling.  Never have had it happen but you use the word literally a lot.    For your next point saying literally approximately 10 oz.  sauce is an ordered item. You didn't order any so I gave you some trying to be nice   You meat also had sauce on it. So nothing was dry and I flavorful.   Again all issues I would have handled with your guy who called.  All which weren't not brought up.",

The BBQ sauces here are in my opinion the best in Las Vegas.",

I would highly recommend having the beef brisket, as that was a a big hit with both of us, and it's only 75 cents more.  The setting is small and intimate, and I think that it was a lot busier than they expected, so it was hard to feed all the hungry folks.  As far as the sauces go, the Original Flavor and the Spicy Flavor were out-of-this-world fantastic!  We WILL be back whenever we're in Vegas again!  #mrandmrspiggy",

The man in the back said he gave me extra mash potatoes but received 2 which was what was ordered with sandwiches. I posted a picture of what they considered the 3 meat baby back rib tips brisket. I also posted what my other 3 meat looked like baby back rib tips and spare ribs. That one looked right then she says oh well credit you $10 then hung up. One combo was 22.04 and not even received. She also wanted to blame Eat 24 because they didn't have tater tots. Bad service all around. Oh a even worse the female puts Pepsi in the sprite and doesn't even fix it just hands it to me and says it's just a little bit my finger hit it. Maybe this place shouldn't allow delivery or pickup orders. Sorry you lost my business.",

    "text": "This little place is phenomenal!!! I moved to Vegas with my family in 2013, since then I have been searching and searching for some really awesome BBQ. Finally, after trying many places I HAVE FOUND the most amazing BBQ in the area. The brisket is so good my coworker couldn't even speak for a few minutes after putting it into his mouth. it is prefect. I had the pulled pork on a bed of homemade mac and cheese and some of their fries. It was fantastic. Vegas this little place may not look like much, but don't judge a book by its cover. This is by far the BBQ I have had since moving to Las Vegas! I will definitely be back. P.S. When you go make sure you have some of their God Sauce, it is heavenly!",
