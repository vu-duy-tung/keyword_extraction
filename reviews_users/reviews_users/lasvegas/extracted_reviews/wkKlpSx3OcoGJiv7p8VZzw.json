We tried the campfire duck, the pork shoulder and the dumplings (that is also how we would rank them from highest to lowest).   The staff is nice, decor is nice but it was hot! Granted it was 109 outside, but their AC could not keep up and we were literally sweating sitting there. Very uncomfortable.  Again, food is good, but I probably won't be back.",

The best places are off the strip (usually on Spring Mountain) and are founded by chefs who ditched life at giant hotels to do things their way.  Sparrow + Wolf is an excellent chef who understands food doing things his way - with an amazing staff to create a perfect environment.  Visit this place.  You won't forget it.",

    "text": "Congratulations to Chef Brian Howard and his entire crew. My group of 14 was very impressed. We've been looking forward to this opening night for a long time.  The service was incredible - this is a crew of professionals that were on their game - I suspect they did a few rehearsals because service was nearly flawless. I don't know the GM's name, but he was fast, accurate and a good host who treats you like your patronage is valued. Jason, our server, was a great guy - very witty, and very attentive. Jackie was handling our drink orders, and she was sharp and helpful as well. Even though the chefs were busy in the back turning out some wonderful food, Brian Howard took the time to come out and say hello to everyone.  The food was, well, Brian Howard. We loved every dish - and we tried almost everything on the menu. The Bento Box included 4 large prawns, a couple of huge crab claws, 6 oysters, a Full Monty (every meat available on the extensive charcuterie menu) - it was incredible. But so was everything! We all passed around our plates; we couldn't get over the tastes. Favorites were the Duck Confit with Foie Gras; Beef Skewers with the best crepe I've ever tasted; the Farm Egg; Charcuterie; Beet & Endive (the endive was smoky goodness) - I could go on and on.  The drinks were excellent. While we all enjoyed the unique cocktails or a glass of wine before and during dinner, there were some real surprises on the drink menu at the end that we enjoyed exposing our group to. The Pedro Jimenez sherry was a huge hit, followed by the Amaro Nonino (there were FIVE amaros on the menu). Chef Howard is way ahead of the game with his cocktail menu, tapping into the rising popularity of sherry and amaros among millenials, and popularizing Cognac again before the whiskey shortage hits.  The restaurant itself is very visually appealing as well as perfectly comfortable for enjoying a long and varied meal.   Go here!",

    "text": "Blown Away!  It's not often that I come across a restaurant that hits so many elements that create an amazing experience for me. Usually I settle for one or two of the 5 things I look for and choose to be happy with that. For me personally my experience last night at Sparrow + wolf is worthy of an explanation.  Location: Center of town and easy to get to from anywhere with tons of parking = No stress getting there or leading up to walking in.  First Impression: Room is gorgeous, Music choice and volume is instantly noticeable and pleasant and the instant view of kitchen and staff working has a good vibe. Bar Stools: Are comfortable AF with nice backrest and arms. As someone who loves to sit at the bar for a drink and a couple appetizers THANK YOU!!!  Menu: This is as close to a dream menu that I could have imagined or have come across. Last time I saw a menu that made me this happy was at The Eddy in NYC. Not to many choices to choose from and every dish seemed to be a signature item like the Udon Lam Sausage, Chinatown Clams Casino (Favorite Dish) and the Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings. Cocktails were also amazing and I found my new favorite spirit which was like a 100% Agave Gin.  Staff: I ate at the bar last night so this is about the bartenders mostly and they were on point. Sara and Cody were attentive, aware and focused on guest experience. They were also knowledgable and passionate about the food and drinks they were about to serve our group of 5 at the bar. The food runners and bussers also did a great job because the food was delivered and cleared seamlessly. Obviously the back of house killed it because everything I ate was stupid good.  Congratulations Chef Brian Howard, Chef Justin Kingsley Hall and GM John Anthony for everything it must have taken from patience to passion to bring all these elements together. What a gift it is for this community to have an establishment like this available to us and thank you to the entire Sparrow + wolf team.

My only critique would be the seasoning of the dishes that I enjoyed. While overall taste was delectable, each dish was a bit over-salted, obscuring the natural flavors that ideally would have peaked through a bit more. Additionally, the staff, particularly my bartender Alana, were very friendly, accommodating and made me feel cared for. I would dine here again in a heartbeat.",

From the moment we set foot in the door we were greeted by staff and seated and from here we were tended to as if the place were empty (full restaurant, but our water glasses never went empty no matter how hard we tried) the staff was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu. Our servers were extremely attentive and personable with our table even though there were only 2 of us.  The food was absolutely delicious. We had the Farm Egg and Beef Skewers, both dishes had excellent flavor and the meat was cooked perfectly. The mango-Chick pea salsa served with the meat gave it a unique flavor that left us wanting more. The Farm egg had such a blend of flavors we ultimately ended up using the meat from the skewers to soak up the very little that was left over in the bowl just so we wouldn't miss out on any of the flavors.   We were recommended the tres leches for dessert, the first bite had the tres leches flavoring with a touch of spice from the Hennessy that was used from the cream. Absolutely amazing.",

    "text": "Sparrow + Wolf is a hot & new trending must try restaurant! My friends decided to take me out for my birthday celebration. They know I love places that I can wine & dine at and this definitely the place to go. Even if it's a birthday, date night or just to explore amazing types of food. Amazing on reservations for a Friday night and seating your party together!  We first started off with drinks. First, we tried Spring Mountain Sour that was like a sweet volcano in your mouth with plum & beet with a spruce of lemon zest all in one! Second, we tried Model T, which definitely takes a name after itself. Reminds me a manly drink hence the dry gin that's in it. Third, we tried Jump The Shark which came in a cute Shark decorative glass. It was a little sweet with a kick of tropics. Lastly, I had this new item drink with Hennessy, but a mix of Sparkling wine, it was my favorite! I thought the Henny would be too strong, but it balances out with all the other flavors.   Now off to the main event, we started off the Charcuterie Board The FULL Monty, the seasonal pickles are mouthwatering. Then we had the Hamachi which was amazing and presentation was amazing. Next, we moved on to Chinatown Casino Clams and it was to die for! The Uni Hollandaise sauce from it was so good I had to dip it into my bread from the charcuterie board.  After, we tried the Oak Grilled Scallops which just melted in your mouth with the corn and miso butter melting together as you chew. Maitake Mushrooms with the hummus made a good impression then we had German Butterball Potatoes to add carbs to the table, the butter, garlic & lemon ash all went well well together, can be used as a side dish. Lastly, for dessert we decided to order the beignets topped with matcha green tea powder with a meringue cream inside. Sounded amazing, but it could of been more creamy and the matcha just added a bitterness taste at the end.   Overall, it's a great place to try different types of modern Midwestern foods with a twist.",

After being seated and waiting a significant amount of time, we literally had to flag down a waiter to even order a drink.  We ordered a bottle of wine and after another significant amount of time we were informed that they no longer had that wine in stock - how long does that take?  Finally we got to order.  While we were ordering, my colleague changed his mind and instead of ordering the steak, ordered the bone marrow and steak tartare - up he likes meat.  She didn't seem to be fazed by this, but when she brought the steak after two rounds of meat already - we all looked at her - like really?  Then she asked us if we wanted anyway, and I said \"well, if you're going to throw it away, but we didn't order it, so I don't want to pay for it\"  Thinking maybe (probably) she now couldn't re-serve it, we could at least taste it (although, we were all stuffed I wouldn't have minded a bite) and she looked at me like I was the rudest thing one earth trying to get one by on her - like we weren't paying 100's of dollars already for this meal or something.  Anyway, sit at the bar and avoid the service problems.",

I am so happy that I have finally come here!  As a resident of China Town, I have never been surprised by the variety of restaurants that are located here, until tonight. This farm to table restaurant with a variety of creative small plates, has blown my mind!  Because there were so many dishes we tried today, I placed a small description of each item under the photos. Some of the orders were specially made for us, so I'm not entirely sure of everything ate, although I enjoyed it all anyways! Originally they were informed there was only 6 of us, Jacob and I were last minute additions and they so kindly helped seat us all anyways.   Our server was extremely kind and informative and we were also greeted by the chef who regularly makes an appearance in the dining room. I loved how personal he made each experience and the multitude of specialty items we had tonight.   My favorite item was by far the bone marrow, and I wish it was on the menu for me to come back and try. It just melted in your mouth and was so sweet and succulent at the same time! I loved the seasonality of the dishes and know that each time I come in will be a new experience.   For a Wednesday night I was extremely surprised at how packed this place was in China Town! I loved the lively ambience even in such a dark space. I had so much fun tonight, this was not only a dinner to me, but also an experience, Sparrow + Wolf has exceeded my expectations, and I will definitely be back here!  Happy Eating!",

We had several cocktails (all super tasty) and shared plates. The steak tartare is divine. We each had all the different types of oysters which was such a delight to the palate. The dumplings were sooo good, too. I highly recommend trying these plates as well as the Japanese sweet potato dish.  I will definitely be making this a spot for regular dining and drinking.",

The middle section was an assortments of meats. That was probably my least favorite part but it was because I ate this last and I was pretty much getting full already.   The last section was poke and seafood! yummmm. Couldn't stop eating it. The giant shrimps! They had these cute little squirt bottles to add your sauce in. We also order their muscles which was one of the specials at that time.   It was in a Miso type sauce. it was pretty salty but that sauce with bread was BOMB!",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended from a hard to please foodie friend who raved about it.  I visited on a Thursday (7 pm) without a reservation with one of my favorite yelpers who's always down to yelp up...  Service: The hostess seated us immediately on a very busy Thursday evening.  Our server was very attentive throughout the evening and the dishes all came out timely.  Throughout our dinner, the manager who i found out later was the owner Brian Howard assisted the server with our table and other tables as well.  He checked on us to ensure we were enjoying our dishes which i totally appreciated.  Food & Drinky Drinks: For drinks, I tried the jump the shark and the spring mountain sour.  Jump the Shark can in a very cool shark headed glass, but the Spring Mountain sour was the winner of the two when it came down to taste.   A very cool mixologist cocktail. This is a place to go with a foodie friend and sample a lot of dishes and my favorites were the: Chinatown Clams: Tasty and after one order, we had to order another one quickly. Farm Egg: The pickled asparagus and feta mixed with the egg all complimented each other. Campfire Duck:  Great preparation of the duck for this dish. Ordering next time. Hamachi: Very fresh and digging it served on the rice paper.  Ambiance: It's a smaller dining area that I assumed it would be but very trendy, contemporary and dimly lit for a great date night.  Lots of dark wood. which keeps it classy.  Noisy because everyone is seated closely and there's definitely a pulse, but not too noisy where it distracts from table conversation.  Location is great and I love the great mixology options along with some interesting dishes to sample.  If you're sampling a lot of dishes, the bill can add up quickly but the quality of food is fantastic.  After this first visit, future visits and dishes are coming in the near future.  Enjoy yourself...it's a celebration! =)",

The bartenders have a list of cocktails that change seasonally, and they know how to make a balanced drink (sweet, acid, alcohol, aromatics). I loved the \"Blister in the Sun\" (Silver Tequila, Lime, Passion Fruit, Thai Chili Orgeat, Campari) which added the dimension of spiciness to the mix. But the others we had were also good.  Plate sizes are good for sharing, but the food is rich, so you can get full without having to order plate after plate.   Must haves include the cheek and marrow dumplings and the steak tartar. I am not the biggest fan of steak tartar, but this version with shitaki mushroom was fantastic.  We were able to sneak in early at the bar, but you will want to get a reservation unless you are feeling lucky.",

    "text": "Really appreciated the unique dishes and innovative flavors here. I'd been meaning to go as the restaurant continues to be well-praised and so happy I finally got the chance to. Very interesting menu items, all with East and Southeast Asian flare, either through certain ingredients and spices or the preparation style more generally. This is an awesome place to come for a group that loves to share food, enjoys the flavors of different Asian cuisine, experiments with new combinations, and comes reasonably hungry. Really really beautiful plating, dishes, and colors as well. Only thing we did wrong was order two desserts, which were both really good, but were somehow bigger than the portions of each entree and we were way too full. My advice would be to try the sweet potato if you're a sweet potato lover! The creme fresh was awesome as a pairing, and they were deliciously sweet and cooked to perfection. It stood out probably because it so exceptionally surpassed expectations, and I always love a sweet potato. I reiterate that the dumplings are necessary. Loved the hamachi and grilled oyster prepared with miso. Short rib fell right off the bone and the bread cut the heaviness is the sauce. Kind of wish we tried the duck too or instead because I love a perfectly cooked duck, but still super happy with the preparation and flavor of the short rib. Toast for dessert!  To clarify, I don't think this restaurant necessarily tops popular contemporary Asian fusion restaurants in cities like NYC, DC, SF, and LA, but it sure does champion almost anything that exists in Vegas. Price point differences aside (this dinner was so reasonable compared to the strip!), the food at Sparrow + Wolf was also objectively much better than anything on the strip, but anyone from Vegas who understands the culinary scene here knows that's how it works. For Vegas, this restaurant is totally a hit, and I would easily come again to try new tastes once the menu changes. Chinatown never fails!",

Wine list is very good and what we picked ended up pairing beautifully with the dishes served.    The swordfish aguachiles was delicious and I did not know you could put that much flavor into romanesco! And the steak tartar is a must order... ours was huge! We piled it onto the buttered, salted bread ( flip the bread over so the butter and salt gets your tongue first) and it was so tender and flavorful! It ended up being like an inch thick on the bread.   The scallops were perfectly cooked and I could have eaten six more of them. The brocollini, with a bit of heat, and the glorious lamb neck came next which was tender and flavorful and paired perfectly with the pickled fruit and veggies and the scallion pancake. Absolutely perfect and thank you so much chef for putting fried garlic chips on it!    The pecan cake for dessert - strawberry compote reminded us of our mom's homemade jam and the Thai basil on top with the crema cut back on the sweetness of the cake and made the flavors explode in our mouths.    We were offered to come back and see the kitchen which was actually fairly small for how many different ways they cook/prepare things. You can tell there is so much thought and effort put into their dishes. One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas!",

When we admitted we hadn't she explained nicely the concept of shared plates and some of the popular dishes.   They have great cocktails and spirit selections. Additionally the food was all superb. We ordered the charred romanesco, hamachi carpaccio, hearth baked bread, scallop robata, duck confit & sweet potato dumplings, and the massive 32-ounce bone-in T-bone served with all of the fixings. All food was great.   The busy restaurant did affect the service along the way as our waitress disappeared and we were wanting to reorder drinks. A sign of a good restaurant though, the manager checked in and saw we were needing refills and then began taking up the slack.   From the photos of the menus it appears they rotate their dishes depending on the season. We will definitely return to continue to explore the options!",

    "text": "It was a Friday night and my friend and I wanted to stay away from the strip. Sparrow and Wolf was recommended by a local. That might have been the reason for the difference of opinion. First, service was the best I've experienced in Vegas. Wish I could say the same about the food. Flavors were over powering. I like heat but I didn't expect the bone marrow to be very spicy which was disappointing. I prefer savory over sweet so I was looking forward  to the duck dumplings. This was just really salty. My friend and I had to eat bread  and drink lots of water between dishes to even out our palates. The saving grace were the oysters but we had those earlier on which served as a nice amuse bouche. The other dishes like the asparagus and scallops also too seasoned or salty. I had high hopes for this restaurant since it was highly recommended but sadly fell short. It felt like it was another Vegas restaurant that catered to tourists that didn't know any better. We didn't mention our disappointment  with the food but the Maitre'D and our server Soji were wonderful and attentative. The restaurant is quaint. Nothing really special. Being served family style, banquettes would do nicely in here vs. just the half booths Two tops are small if sharing dishes. Bar area did look appealing. Wish I could recommend this restaurant especially to my out of town friends but like me, they enjoy fine food and don't mind spending their money for it. Thank you",

The food came out pretty slow although there weren't that many people in the restaurant just yet. I really wanted to enjoy everything but cocktails were unimpressive and the food was very salty.  We had: 2 cocktails that I cannot remember + -wasabi and celery root oyster/miso&lemon oyster -hamachi carpaccio  -chinatown clam casino  -beef cheek &a bone marrow dumplings  Hamachi carpaccio came out first and was actually pretty good. But since it had so many flavors within the dish, I couldn't eat past 3 bites. The rest of the dishes were so salty, I kept drinking 4-5 glasses of water. Maybe my taste is too unrefined for these complex flavors, but I feel that they need to work on their seasonings and flavors first, not just trendy vibes and pretentious menu.",

    "text": "This is one of the restaurants we've been wanting to try for a while now and we finally made it in last night. Overall, we were very pleased with everything. The food was great and service was good for the most part. It definitely met our expectation especially after hearing and reading so much about this place. There were four of us and we spent $300 not including alcohol. We did order quite a bit of food. They're all small plates but shareable. Some of our favorites are the scallops, pate, Japanese sweet potato, the porterhouse steak, ocean parfait (uni) and the steak tartare. Here are some of the dishes that didn't quite meet our expectations. The bone marrow had way too much sauce on it and it was quite spicy. Can't really taste the bone marrow at all. The duck confit dumpling was too doughy, wasn't as flavorful as we'd like. Here comes the biggest disappointment. The special of the day, one soft shell crab in Panang sauce. The crab was too chewy yet hard to eat because the outer layer was already turning into a shell, there wasn't a whole lot of meat and what was on there had no flavor as if it had been defrosted or bought a while ago. It was not crispy and soft at the same like what you would expect from fried soft shell crab. I just feel like they missed the mark and for the price of $26 for the dish. We don't expect every dish to be perfect. However, our biggest disappointment of all which cost them 1 Star is how it was handled when we brought it up to their attention about the soft shell crab. We had a long discussion with our server about it and mentioned it to one of the managers when he came to dropped off our check and he just brushed it off. I'm not expecting any thing free but it just seems like they didn't care about our feedback enough to address it further. Would we give them another shot? Probably but won't be as enthusiastic about it like we were before.",

Flavors seems to b either too salty or too much flavors going on that don't complement each other. This was our first and prob last time here. Been here tried it and nothing to rave about.

This time we got -Ribeye special -lobster dumplings -maitake mushroom -chinatown clams casino  -lime creme brulee   Service was okay here this time. Didn't feel like our server went so much out of his way for us but it wasn't bad either.   Finally got the full portion of the maitake mushrooms and it was just as good as the sample my friend made for me the first time I went. I almost finished the whole bowl to myself. I think that the clams are now 2 little ones for $7.50. I had ordered two pieces but our order came out with 4 shells. I was a little confused thinking they charged us for 4 but when the itemized check came out we were only charged for 2. Then I realized that the clams were a lot smaller than the last two times I went. We got the ribeye special cooked to medium. Sooo good and perfectly cooked! The lentils on this dish were amazing and everything went together so well. The lobster dumplings were eh. Not my personal fave, but honestly I think the bone marrow dumplings were better. For dessert I was torn between sticking to what I knew or trying something new. I loooove the honey toast here and it is honestly one of the reasons why I come back. I decided to step out of my comfort zone lol. I tried the lime creme brulee, which our server suggested was better than the honey toast. I gave it a try, really delicious, buuuuuut.... I have to say my heart is stuck on the honey toast.  Overall, still a great dining experience and it was actually better than the last time I came in. I love this place and I will keep coming back so long there is honey toast hahaha.",

Stepping into the door the atmosphere was electric and you could tell the people were enjoying their food and drinks. My bride and I were quickly seated and drink selection began. My wife ordered the apropos and although my drink tastes are simpler I have to admit it was amazing.  Our server could be an auctioneer telling us the specials and the staff on water duty were faster than a ball boy at Wimbledon. We ordered the steak tartare, oysters and tiger prawn appetizer which was amazing. A bit af a religious act as the server guided me through mixing the egg yolk in. I ordered the roasted duck and my wife the short rib.  The duck was amazingly delicious and rich. It was filling and I had a bite left at the end of the meal and was sorry there were no militant vegans I could share with and baptize them into the world of amazing food at the top if the food chain. My wife's short rib was perfectly seasoned but the bone was anything but short. I suppose its as a hand to hand weapon if your accosted by the nut job shouting guys in the parking lot on Fridays.  Management stopped by to ensure everything was to our satisfaction and informed us if upcoming events that although I was stuffed almost got my mouth watering again. Needless to say we will be back. Hopefully we will coordinate for a protest day and convert some misguided soul back to the path of sanity and deliciousness.",

I hope that is a permanent dish on the menu.    Get the Caramelized Honey Toast for dessert.  Holy s*** it's good. Served with tarragon ice cream, and it is delicious.  Yep, tarragon ice cream.",

If you want to eat at a place where the manager (John) touches each table with a passion for food and hospitality that's second to none - a place where the small plates are a hybrid of Providence on Melrose and Factory Kitchen in the Los Angeles Arts district - this is the place. Each small plate gives four guests a pretty good sampling. Some of the best dishes we've had in a long, long time were the beet salad with charred lemon ash and blue cheese; perfectly cooked octopus with house-made XO sauce; and beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings with reduced balsamic vinaigrette. We have never had digestives after the meal but this time we decided to try a couple and boy were we surprised on how effective they were. If the manger (John) isn't too busy, it's fun to hear him discuss the history of digestives.  This place is on its way to becoming one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Grab a seat now before the word gets out. It's only been open three months and it was packed tonight. I foresee in the near future that you will need to make reservations a month before your visit.   Loved this place loved the staff. John: thanks! You brought life to the food and took us on a culinary journey we will never forget.",

    "text": "Our first time in after much anticipation.  I must say this place has great potential HOWEVER... Called ahead and a table was available.  Small room, intimate but loud. If that makes any sense.  The hostess informed us that they had just re-opened after re-tooling the entire menu.  This information really did not need to be disclosed. It just made us wonder why, and if something was wrong.   We were sat right away at a deuce in the middle of the room. But with no reservation on a Saturday night we weren't going to be too picky.   The server came to the table and just started our order. No greeting. No menu explanation. No specials. Nothing. So I introduced myself to her and greeted her instead to get things going.   We ordered cocktails before dinner. It took, and I am not exaggerating, 20 minutes to get an Old Fashion and a glass of wine.   We decided to order the charcuterie plate as a first course. A few minutes later she asked us if we wanted to order apps. So we did. 35 minutes later the second courses of apps arrived. When we asked for the first course they just said this is how it comes out. So finally after another ten minutes the manager brought out the first course.  The server talked me into the foie gras special app. At Market Price. Watch out for MP!  $30 for this dish.   Now it's been an hour and a half and we are really digging the food. Amazing flavor. The chef is very talented. The use of beets in 3 out of four of our dishes but all completely different in taste and texture was amazing.   When it came to finally ordering our main course we were informed that they were out of the dish. When u only have five entrees and u run out of one at 8 pm that's not a good sign.   The GF didn't want or couldn't eat any of the other four entrees so we decided to go directly to dessert and after dinner cocktail.   Upon finishing I tried unsuccessfully to wave down our server for fifteen more minutes. By now I am tired and getting ornery and just wanted to go home.   All in all the food was amazing. But the operations needs ALOT of work still.  I just don't know if I want to spend another two and a half hours and not even get dinner for another $150.   Good luck",

Then things start to turn sour when our server takes our order. She was not friendly and had attitude. Think big blonde hair. After we placed our order she made it a point to tell us the dishes come out in order and not sporadic. We order bread, tartare, romanesco, soba duck for starters. Dumplings & duck for main. After about an hour after receiving starters we asked about our mains. The manager it seems, told us they were plating them. Ok cool. 20 minutes later nothing. My friend decides she was not hungry anymore and candles dumplings but I still want my duck. I was hangry at this point bc I saved my stomach for the main. I was then told that my duck was never ordered  the chefs comes out and says it will take 6-7 mins to make so I said ok I'll wait. 17 mins pass and nothing. Finally get my duck and it's salty and under cooked so it was chewy and not tender.  What a disappointment. So much pot",

    "text": "We decided to do Thank$giving in La$ Vega$ this year, and was happy to find that several restaurants offered interesting twists on the traditional turkey dinner.  After having an excellent dinner at the new (less than 2 years old) Sparrow + Wolf, we find that we should eat off-strip more often!    LOCATION Vegas sort of has a Chinatown on the North side, but the layout reminds me a bit like Rowland Heights with lots of distributed strip malls loaded with restaurants and groceries that tend to open late.  Look for the mall with Macy's furniture and Sura BBQ Buffet and you'll see Sparrow + Wolf in bright white lights.  DRINKS Definitely recommend trying their libations.  Safeword is a nice, sweeter cocktail of pineapple rum,hazelnut orgeat, and chocolate sea salt.    FOOD We went for their special Thanksgiving menu.  I liked how they used lots of Asian flavors throughout the traditional turkey dinner.  They also specialize in wood-roasting their meats.  * Fuji Apple and Endive Salad was crunchy, bitter, tart, and savory at the same time. * Deviled duck eggs were really creamy and the mix of smoked salmon into the yolk added some extra umami. * Duck Confit Dumplings with sweet potatoes is a cute, Asian-inspired appetizer with a thick, rubbery skin to hold everything together and to soak up that bone broth. * For the turkeys, the wood-roasted breast was among the juiciest I've had.  The default gravy here was excellent.  We found the chicken-fried dark meat a bit on the dry side.  Apparently you need to use either the sweet cranberry or the super-spicy Japanese Mustard with the fried stuff. * Both sides were awesome - creamy mashed potatoes with dashi gravy was smooth.  Acorn squash with Korean sauce was sweet and spicy with nice crunch from the pumpkin seeds.  It was borderline dessert-like! * Lastly, pumpkin pie ended the meal perfectly.  Not overly sweet nor overly thick or rich. A well-executed Asian-style dessert where the miso whipped cream gives a light salty kiss.  Definitely a 5-star dining experience for Thank$giving!",

The ingredients always taste of the highest quality and extremely fresh. Staff is always attentive and polite but yet laid back and easy going. Place is always full and causally loud with table sod friends talking and laughing. The music is a good mix and not loud enough to have to scream over it to talk to your table. The openness of the kitchen is extremely inviting.   Can't wait for another date night to go back!",

It's in an old location, Chinatown of Vegas which is more of an Asian town, full of interesting restaurants and ethnically Asian beyond just Chinese.  Sparrow + Wolf is an interesting name and definitely much more subdued than your usual strip experience. He described it as more San Francisco restaurant, a bit of West meets East, a bit quirky and unexpected combination of ingredients mixed together. I can't help but wonder if he was describing the two of us. Completely different cultural background and experiences, a chance meeting on a white water rafting trip in the American river twenty some odd years ago that paired us together out of pure coincidence, and still together in our unusual ways, finding good eats wherever we go.   I didn't do the ordering as he ordered for us. Definitely the foie gras. Sweetbread, Hamachi, Salad, and Duck and some wine later. I don't think I've had a good meal like this in a while, the back east traveling and Asia travel did not yield any finds like this.  We had come here a few times now together, this was by far a more interesting outing than some of the other meals we have had in the past in Vegas.   Funny enough, A friend of mine just checked into this spot the very next night, clearly a crowd pleaser. I would absolutely recommend a reservation for those who come in a group. Otherwise, expect a wait.",

Unfortunately our dining experience was just a little bleh. Don't get me wrong, the food was yummy, but not \"blow your mind, this is amazeballs, I want this again\" kind of yummy that I was expecting.  Ordered a couple of cocktails, creative but a little strong on their flavors.  We also ordered charred romanesco (really good), duck confit and sweet potato dumplings (meh), scallops and a their fresh baked bread.  Interestingly the scallops were served with 3 turnips that were poached to \"mimic\" scallops...I rarely don't eat something on a plate but these weren't my thing (and I do like turnips!) The harvest bread with umami butter and salt flake was too hard for me. The crust was quite thick and difficult to chew :(  Butter was good, but hey who doesn't like butter!! The restaurant has a rotating menu, so we may have just hit it on a bad night or ordered the wrong things.  All in all i was a bit disappointed, may try again though!  All these great reviews cant be wrong, but for now 3 stars from me!",

For food just be aware that portions are very small, almost like tapas.  We ate family style which was a good choice because there were so many delicious items on the menu. We had 6 people in our group which gave us each a small taste of some of the smaller dishes. For our main courses we ordered the porterhouse special which was large and gave us all a decent amount of meat. It comes with a lot of side dishes as well so if you go with this option I would hold off on ordering sides until you find out what the steak is served with.   I'm gonna start a new section to talk about the scallops separately because they were SOO good.  If you're deciding between scallops and something else either order both or just the scallops.    Drinks were good. Tried a few and all were delicious.  Oyster were decent but not fantastic.",

    "text": "Came here and got the Salmon Poke, Beef cheeks + bone marrow dumplings, Lasagna, octopus, duck, and mushrooms.  There were some tiers in terms of the quality of food IMO.The dishes on one level were the poke, dumplings, and duck.   The poke was on this crunchy rice wrap and had the szechuan peppercon flavoring. Loved using the wrap as a vessel to consume the poke and the spice had a nice subtle kick (assuming you are used to szechuan cuisine).  The dumpling had this green onion foam on it, which I didn't think added much except for presentation. The actual dumpling had a thicker/harder skin than most dumplings. I think it really meshed with the thicker filling well though. Make sure you use the base with the dumpling as it might be a bit bland without it (since the skin is thick).  The duck had some foie gras on it and that was delicious. The duck stole the show though. Definitely had no gamey taste and was just cooked perfectly. On the more rare side, and had a nice outer layer vs just meat. It had a great balance of meat + skin/fat and that made the bites that much more delicious. I really prefer having both in my bites.  The mushrooms. It was hummus (not special) + some terra chips (def not special) with 3 pieces of mushrooms. Was not worth...  The octopus had some korean sauce on the outside and it was pretty spicy. I thought the quality of the octopus was really good, it was just that there was too much sauce and that didn't sit well with me. Overwhelming flavor, because of that reason I'd pass on that.  The lasagna wasn't that special IMO. The doughy layers were very soft, almost like mac and cheese texture so that was nice. I couldn't tell the lamb was lamb (tasted like beef tbh). Not sure why use lamb when it just tastes like beef.  Overall it's a great experience. If you stick with some certain dishes you will love this place",

Finally, the boyfie surprised me with dinner here after my flight. We were on time for our reservation, but still had to wait 15 mins. It was fine because we ordered drinks in the waiting area :)  Ordered: x Casino Clams - This was probably my favorite dish of the night. One clam topped with a couple pieces of uni. Delicious, but very rich. Expensive, though.  x Bone Marrow - MMM, I love bone marrow! Can never go wrong with this dish. I just didn't like how they put meat on top of the marrow... it was almost TOO rich. We actually ended up taking all the meat off and pushing it aside.  x Beef Cheek and Bone Marrow Dumplings - I couldn't really taste the bone marrow because the beef cheek was so overpowering. It was tasty, but a very heavy dish. wish there was more texture inside the dumpling. Beautiful presentation, but just didn't cut it for me. x Duck Entree - Delicious duck. Really enjoyed how this was prepared and it was cooked perfectly. Flavors were good.  I left feeling stuffed, which I HATE. Everything was so heavy and buttery... Maybe next time around I'll order a few lighter dishes and maybe less meaty dishes? I really like the innovation here, but it's just sooooo heavy :(",

We ordered ten items to share. Some of us got cocktails, which were great! Three of the six in the party could eat big meals as a norm, but we were all full by the eighth item.  Gastronomically fantastic. Surprising blend of flavors. Great for dates, meetup with a friend, or celebrations. Not much in terms of large tables. Keep your party to two people or up to four. Anything larger, you may need to secure reservations early.  The dress attire of the crowd goes from business casual to fancy.",

    "text": "After going here twice in one month, all I have to say is this place is AMAZING. But some important points first:   1) MAKE A RESERVATION !!!! It's a small restaurant, if you just randomly walk in on Friday/Saturday night, I promise your wait will be 1-2 hours.   (Also, for a reservation online you must submit a credit card and they WILL charge you if you don't show OR arrive late, they will even charge you a percentage for each guest - so take your reservation seriously)   2) Meals are generally for sharing   3) Unless you are a chef or a member of the culinary academy - I wouldn't expect to understand the menu - it's as if it's written in another language and a bit confusing - BUT I PROMISE the food is actually amazingly delicious!!   The servers were knowledgeable about the menu, which we all appreciated because no one understood what the menu had to offer, but they were patient and answered all our questions.   My favorite cocktail is the Wooden Shoe  My favorite meals were the porter house steak and duck   It's an upscale restaurant in Chinatown without the cost and annoyance of the strip. You could possibly spend hundreds of dollars here or at least $50 for one meal/drink",

The food is, for the most part, average; the prices are sky high and the service stinks.  So lately I have taken to checking out the off-the-strip establishments. And I have to say I have been amply rewarded. Case in point, Sparrow + Wolf. OMG! A foodie's haven away from the torture of the strip. Located in Chinatown, it is nouveau cuisine but totally relatable. Fresh new takes on the classics.  The place is cozy, intimate and friendly. The fare superb.  Tuna poke, wood fired lasagne, beef cheek and marrow dumplings and short rib (see pictures) just blew us away (my daughter and her husband from New York were my dining companions). A lovely experience complemented by very friendly staff.",

Sparrow and Wolf is definitely a gem, arguably a diamond. It has a cozy vibe, and a lot of energy in the room from other tables conversations. I love that the menu is simple, yet there is enough in there to satisfy anybody and your party.   We went with the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, the roasted mushrooms with Turkish hummus, The flintstone short rib, and the duck breast with foie gras.  Everything was fantastic! We were both surprised how great each plate was - a perfect combination of textures, flavors, and spices. We then went for dessert and had the honey toast and the coconut beignets. Both really amazing, but the honey toast had me at hello.   All the plates are designed for sharing (including desserts), so bring friends and try to sample as many plates as you can, as everything we tried was excellent. I will be back soon :)",

Our party of 3 walked in around 8:30 pm with no reservations but we got seated at the bar immediately by John, who was happy and friendly when greeting us. The restaurant is very hipster but also stylish and upscale. Loved the interior decor.   Our bartender, Andrew, had lots of suggestions on wines. I love it when bartenders share the wealth of knowledge that they have. We were also asked if we wanted tap water or bottled Voss water and I know that made my friend happy because she's such a water snob, lol. The menu is simple but has lots of variety.   We ordered the maitake mushrooms, 2 orders of the lamb udon, and the scallops. My friends were raging over how good the maitake mushrooms were. I tasted the scallops and was very impressed. So buttery! It makes up for the fact that the scallops came out later than the rest of our food. Also, I want to say that the lamb udon IS ALL THE HYPE because it was soooo bomb. It needs to be ordered with the egg, in my opinion.  Will definitely be coming back! Andrew and John were so amicable and professional and customer service did not disappoint.",

The menu is always amazing here and I've got to rank the oysters, porterhouse, and foie gras at the top with all of the different small dishes and sauces that compliment this mastery of dry aged meat, chimichurri, and chili paste were my favorites! The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable the hostess was very accommodating and the two times I've been there I've had conversations with the owner and chef who is extremely talented in his craft; definitely world class skill and devotion.

My friend said she was very informative. They had 3 specials for the evening, we enjoyed their octopus special. We also enjoyed a mix of oysters, scallops, hamachi,broccolini, and bone marrow dumplings. The scallops are a must! They are extremely spicy and trust me I can handle spicy. The broccolini was super delicious a little spice as well. The oysters tasted fresh the only down side is that one had an Asian meat according to my friends and the other trio had dairy. The hamachi was a little sweet but still delicious and finally the octopus. The octopus was my favorite dish! I don't consume red meat nor poultry so I didn't enjoy the dumplings nor the duck. My friends however, said the dumplings were amazing and the duck was a pass.",

Now I will never go to this restaurant & would advise others to do the same. This is absolutely ridiculous. What if someone was in an accident on the way to their reservation? Would they get charged this inordinate amount of money too? I realize this may put a slight hardship on a restaurant to book people & then have them cancel.

It's old world and new world meeting in the same place, with great care and respect shown for ingredients and patrons alike.

The hostess was really nice and said they only had bar seating and that was fine, I thought of this place last minute....but as we sat at the bar she realized a table opened up and asked if we wanted it after they set it up...of course! We sat at the bar and waited and the bartender was uber friendly and mentioned to not feel locked down to the drinks on the menu that they loved making freestyle drinks...when our table opened up they joked that we left them haha. The waiter took awhile to get to our table but it was fine, took us much longer to decide on what we were drinking and the menu was interesting. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and I love that the Pinot they have is from Willamette...it's my favorite region for a Pinot and it was delicious. We asked him for recommendations on food and the choices all sounded even better! We love the story behind the casino clams and ordered that, bone marrow, bread, and the beef rib that he said was new on the menu. The bone marrow dumpling was so delicious...he said the bread would be good with it for the sauce...but the only bad thing about this place was that bread....it was so hard....you could break a tooth! The casino clam was the most flavorful thing I've ever had and I couldn't even describe it or compare it to anything except say it's amazing and a must order. The beef rib was good, but next time I'd probably eat 2 Casino clams instead. I decided to have dessert since I was on a winning streak. I tried the lemon souffle cake, and it was very light and I love how it just finished the palate nicely. My boyfriend didn't like the noise level in here, he loves a quiet place...I had. I problem with it...the food was spectacular. I'll be back for sure. Yummy!",

Our waiter was really sweet & accommodating, if only I could remember his name. He made sure to share with us the specials and informed us if there was a certain dish or drink that they were running low on or wasn't available and offered recommendations for alternatives.    My friend and I order the oysters, the big ass pork shank (yes, that's the actual name), and the Bone Marrow Log with escargot and mushrooms. It doesn't seem like a lot of food but it was really filling for two people. Especially, the big ass pork shank! Everything was very flavorful and the pork shank melted in your mouth. I highly recommend it as well as the bone marrow log. I actually recommend everything we ordered. We were not disappointed at all.   As for the drinks, they're on the pricier side but they did come in a cool, rose gold Gnome. Sadly, we couldn't keep it but it was definitely IG worthy! The drinks were tasty so I have no complaints there. I will definitely be going back there again!",

Upon entrance, I noticed the lovely decor they have and very intimate atmosphere - perfect for a date night or girl's night out!   The menu isn't extensive but has a good variety. We started with wine (I chose Riesling) and water (you can choose from voss or tap). The bartender, Andrew, let us taste the wine before committing to anything. Im not sure if this is standard whether you're sitting at the bar and/or table or not. Anyway, we went ahead and ordered 2 of the udon, maitake mushrooms, and scallops. The udon came out first, then the mushrooms. There was a 10-15 minute wait after the udon then the scallops came out... but trust me when I say it was totally worth the wait! So buttery and so so good. The udon was cooked perfectly. The mushrooms were paired with the crispy things (i forgot what they're called lol).   The service at this establishment is wonderful, to say the least. John, the manager I believe, even took the time to chat with us - such a delightful human being! My friends and I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Chef Brian Howard has a hit on his hands with S+W! Nestled into Chinatown with a tight menu of raw and wood-fired shareables, the dark space is cozy, modern, and classic all at once. I'm more about the flavors and service when dining out, but I really enjoyed the decor and ambiance found here. The menu was such that our group ordered nearly everything available, and there wasn't a single dish that didn't find a fan.  The dish I will never be able to not get is the Butcher Wings with burnt tomato and nudja, sold by the whole piece. They are huge, juicy, and full of flavor. The Argentinian Red Shrimp is another delicious dish, and the Sweetbreads were a surprise hit at the table too, accented with smoked bacon and peas. The delicate Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings are beautiful and surprisingly light despite the rich filling, but those with texture issues may be turned off by the green onion emulsion. The beef skewer entree is a great choice that highlights the use of the wood-burning oven, and the chickpea relish really makes it pop. The Campfire Duck was the favorite dish most of the other diners preferred, but the portion only really allows for a shared taste at the table. Like Phil T says in his review, I'd appreciate the option of a larger portion to really enjoy. The pork shoulder and halibut are also solid choices for those preferring those proteins, the former benefitting from the texture of black garlic and peanuts while the latter was simply and perfectly cooked with a nice citrus confit to complement.  Whether or not you try the house bread and butter is a personal preference- while it's tasty, I'd rather splurge on other items. The artichoke dish was a bit of a disappointment to me, presentation reminiscent of a terrarium but not much in the way of actual artichoke. The udon with lamb (and added farm egg, per our server) was just okay and went unfinished at our table; perhaps it is better without the addition, which made it a very wet dish.  The desserts were okay; neither the Calamansi Tart nor the take on Tres Leches quite hit the right spot but both were beautiful and unique options. Looking forward to returning for their late-night burger specials and some more seafood, like the Chinatown Clams Casino.   Service throughout our visit was attentive, and we were able to take a tour of the kitchen and speak with the chef himself about his sourcing and inspirations, which is always a treat. The staff really seem to push the Bento Box option, which includes some exceptionally fresh oysters and house-made terrines- good option if you're looking to impress.   TIP: Make a reservation if rolling in as a group so you can snag the large table in the front dining area with the best lighting.",

I came in on a Thursday night and l was luckily able to snag a table for 4. The menu is pretty easy to navigate over. My family pretty had a good tasting of the menu during our visit since everything was tapas.   Nothing disappointed. I loved everything. The duck and foie gras was BOMB and you know it's good when everything including the food decorations on the dish is amazing. So amazon that we had to ask John how the wood ear was cooked! (Emailing you still about the recipe) hehe   The dumplings were amazing with the garlic and onion foam! I honestly don't know what dumpling can top that one. The fresh sour dough bread was fresh, hot, and crispy. Recommend it if you're a bread lover like me. I do wish the bread had something more than just plain butter since everything else was so out of this world.   Cocktails were cool. I liked how John told us that nothing gets wasted in the kitchen so they use it in cocktails! So new cocktails every so often according to the kitchen menu. Woo   Service was very attentive and water cup was always full.   Small rant: One thing I loved was that our server ask if I wanted ice water, water, or bottle water when we first sat down! I hate when servers ask me if I want tap water or bottle.   Coming back soon!!",

I can confidently say that original hits were not a fluke, new menu items are the similarly intriguing and delicious with Chef Howard's signature blend of innovation and bold flavors. Really hard pressed to pick my favorites but I can confidently say your crazy to not try the Beef Short-Rib, the layers of spice in conjunction with the unctuous nature of the  traditionally braised meats is intoxicating. Wood-fired lasagna is rustic crunchy and delicious! Uni Melt is a great way to enjoy the delicacy. Tried multiple vegan and vegetarian items as two of our guests were of that inclination, the scallion noodles as well as the bbq salsify were very tasty, Japanese sweet potato is out of this world, like a soft yam custard layered with sour cream and scallions. Team acknowledged the B-Day in my reservation notes with a sampling from the menu and candles, fortunately the chef is very pretty as his singing voice is terrible.  Service team is attentive and welcoming, super friendly.  Will be returning for sure.",

The menu is also always evolving with the seasons, the dumplings are always on point, the bone marrow is to date, one of my most flavor filled dish of my life.    The food aside, the staff is ALWAYS on.  Busy or not, you can count on smiles, attentive service, and excellent explanations of the dishes and the preparation that goes into each. If you can't decide on what to get I have never been let down by their personal recommendations.  I recommend you go with at least a few other people and share 4-5 dishes, because you wont be able to decide on just a couple. You wont be disappointed.",

The menu wasn't too big which I like. The tables were kind of close to each other I was fine with it but some may feel a little crowed. The advantage with tables so close is that I can easily check out what others are having. Things I liked: *Wasabi butter, celery root oyster which was very refreshing. *Lobster wrapped in Kim Chi, if you like Kim chi you will need to try it and the foam was delicious. *Foie Gras with corn meal and pickled carrot was excellent. Great contrast with all the parts of the dish. *And I loved the Honey toast with mascarpone ice cream. The toast was nicely brulee and the ice cream was smooth and creamy but not too sweet. Things I didn't like: *Oyster shiitake mushroom and lap cheong vinaigrette - I love shiitake and lap cheong but with oyster just didn't work for me. They overpowered the oyster. *The dinner took over two hours. Not sure why. The next table came at least 30 minutes behind us but their dishes seemed to be arrived about the same time as mine. Our server was fine but she seemed to struggle to keep up with all her tables. *Beef Kafta - actually everything of the dish were good except the beef. The beef just didn't have a lot of flavor.  Overall I really liked the restaurant and appreciated chef Brian's creativity and the way he brought many different ingredients and flavors around the world to create his dishes. I look forward to go back to S&W.",

    "text": "Stopped by here as a result of a restaurant phone game, where you ask one spot where they go eat if they had to eat somewhere else, so we ended up hear after eating at the LV Momofuku spot.    Got here super early on a weekday as we were here for a anniversary trip and didn't want to fight any crowds.   The vibe is very young and modern and fusiony.   Staff was nice and attentive.   The food was crisp and citric.   Fav dish at this spot was the Hamachi.  They had some larger dishes, but we were doing a food crawl so kept things light.  It's off the Vegas Strip, so if you're looking for something off the LV Strip then check it out, as it's super close to Raku Sweets so you can go there for dessert.  Not a cheap spot though, so wont be escaping the LV Strip prices just the crowds and blinding lights.",

I took a few friends here for happy hour to check this off my bookmark list and we were not disappointed.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed ourselves.  Highlights of our happy hour experience were Chinatown claims casino and house charcuterie.  Our bartender Sarah made several choices for our charcuterie and it was finger-licking good.  My friends tried several of the craft cocktails (sorry, I was on wine time) and loved them all, especially the where theres' smoke.  We were visited by one of the co-owners and he really personalized our experience, gave us some of the backstory of how Sparrow + Wolf came to be and the genesis of some of the menu items.    Great food, great ambiance, great staff.  Sparrow + Wolf is a solid spot.  Can't wait to come back and try that Campfire Duck.",

Set a very positive tone even before arriving.  Promptly seated in the only area suitable for a large group.  Rest of the restaurant was pretty full. Waitress was quick to greet.   So there was one person in the group that is a bit of a wine snob, more because she reacts poorly to sulfates.  The manager came over and was incredibly helpful in providing suggestions. Settled with a Chilean red that was not even on the menu.  Great suggestion.   The manager suggested the Benito Box.  Another superior choice. Fed 6 quite well.  The waitress suggested nearly the perfect amount of food for the table. All was outstanding and I mean outstanding.    A great measure of a restaurant Is the knowledge of all the employees about the menu.  The food runners knew and described each of the 5 dishes perfectly. They included duck, beef rib, scallops, mushrooms, and a fish.   Service was very good. The food was outstanding. The ambience was greatly influenced by the staff and was outstanding.  Clearly a 5 star place all the way around.",

They offered such interesting mixed drinks, including the one I chose that was tea flavored. My boyfriend and I shared three plates, plus a dessert. Their charred romanesco (I love romanesco and rarely see it on menus so this was extra exciting) is extraordinary. Most of their dishes have an Asian flare to them--even their lasagna, which comes with miso toast (please order that by the way). Their dessert menu did not disappoint either! We shared the chocolate eclair, which is another item rarely seen on menus. The service was so friendly and our waitress was great at helping us decide what to order. If you're visiting and want a night slightly off the strip--or even if you weren't planning on leaving the strip--give this place a shot!",

Everything is so flavorful. Check in on yelp when you're here and you get a free glass of wine! They have an amazing wine selection and I got Frank Family Zinfandel as my complimentary glass.  JASON, our server was EXCELLENT. His menu knowledge is spot on and he made us feel like we were the only table here, which we weren't. All in all everything was perfect. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone. They have so many selections for so many different people and I am dairy, gluten and meat free so I would know. ENJOY!!",

We mentioned something to the server and the owner came out and 100% made up for the experience and treated us like royalty.  The food is amazing and is never off, but if u ever have issues with service or wait times, rather than going home and writing a terrible yelp review, give them the chance to fix it...they always will.",

Decor and ambience is nice, very clean, very modern, and very trendy. The food are large plates meant for sharing. We ordered the campfire duck, big ass pork shank, udon, lemongrass chicken, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and Spanish octopus. Everything we ordered was delicious. My favorite plates were the campfire duck and udon. My only complaint was it took a very long time for some dishes to come out. The time we waiting between the second to last and last dish was like 30 minutes. By the time the last meal (lemongrass chicken, which is very good) most of my party was tired from waiting. Overall, I enjoyed my dinner here, I recommend it, and will be back.",

    "text": "Went to Sparrow and Wolf before a show on the strip. We had a reservation for 6pmThe initial impression is good, clean, you could smell good things cooking even from the parking lot. We were a party of 2 and we got seated in the front of the restaurant...boo hiss. The wait staff had to constantly go behind my chair and rubbed/bumped into it/me several times. Annoying. We ordered drinks, I got a specialty cocktail and my wife a Cosmopolitan. They don't have a full bar (no Grey Goose Vodka) but they had a decent selection of other vodkas so all in all, ok. The drinks took longer than they should have to come out, but we got our water right away, which was good. The waitress made it back with the drinks and explained the menu to us, it's mostly small plates meant to be shared. So you between the two of us it makes it fun to try new things and not fill up on just one! We really enjoyed the drinks and the waitress did a great job explaining all the options for us! She was very friendly and informative and we took her recommendations on plates to order and which order for them to be served. We also ordered a glass of wine each to accompany the meal. The food was fantastic! Really a great meal all around, the scallops and the lamb neck were particularly good. The Lamb is quite a lot, I would say full entree sized, so be careful if that's one of your choices. We left full and happy! My only recommendation would be to  change the way the tables are arranged to avoid the small tables right in the front. I think had we been seated better this would be a 5-star review!",

We ordered the oysters, steak tartare, Japanese sweet potato, pigs ear, charcuterie board, scallops, short rib, and duck. Everything was above & beyond delicious, but we could've done without the pigs ear. It was described as if it was layered and each piece was crispy like chicharron. Instead, it was served as one ball of breaded pig's ear. So the breading fell away and we were left with just cartilage.  Main reason that this was not a 5-star Experience was the pace of service, which was oddly slow. We received one dish at a time with uncomfortably long wait times in between.",

Value wise, I believe it is one of the best places to go for a great meal at a  good value (to include wine/cocktail pairings).  Favorites?  They change the menu up quite a bit, so things we had may disappear soon.  The braised short rib is definitely a winner, but from a vegetable perspective anything the Chef has done with salsify has been amazing and I think we have had it a different way every time from puree to a a more hardy bite.  Other ones to try - ocean safari, china town clams casino, hamachi carpaccio, duck confit dumplings, and braised lamb neck.  Drink wise - try them all, you won't be disappointed (maybe not all in one night tho')",

Additionally we got lucky with the encrusted grouper entree because the universe blessed us with the menu change of halibut and L E M M E tell you that fish slapped me silly. One of the best seafood entrees I've had in ages. In addition to the bread with umami butter, there was unfortunately no room for dessert. But of course, this is just the universe's way of telling us that we will be back. Also, the chef Bryan was super sweet and checked on us more than once which is always a plus.  PS if the barrel aged cocktail of the day is the bourbon with chocolate and hazelnut bitters... just do it.",

The food was not good, but they clearly get people to find them fancy by writing absurdly verbose descriptions and adding in ingredients that make very little sense to the tongue. The few pieces that were edible were mediocre and far too salty. So, no, I definitely would never, ever eat here again given the \"merits\" of the food alone.  Secondly, the service was poor. The people were all very nice (which is the reason for a 2-star and not a 1-star rating), BUT they NEVER asked us if we wanted another drink after an hour and a half of being in their establishment. Note to restaurant: You make more money when people buy more drinks. It is, therefore, always to your benefit to ask if people want more wine and booze. Not sure why I even have to make this clear.",

Scallops and the porterhouse were cooked perfectly with the best combination of flavors to bring out the best in each of the proteins. We all loved everything, the least favorite was the broccolini dish which was still good but not great.   Their menu changes seasonally so there isn't a point in recommending a specific dish but I do recommend trying as much as you can. The portions were larger than expected and the food is extremely rich and filling.   Ambience is lovely, great for small gatherings or date night. It was a bit loud and hard to hear across our table of 6. They offered mock tails along with their cocktails which were both quite tasty.   The only downfall was the time it took to be served. It was busy on a Thursday night and it appeared that there were only 2 servers. The time between being seated and ordering then to receiving the food was longer than we would have liked. Plan for a long dinner. The quality of food was worth the wait but improving the service time would gain a 5 star rating.",

    "text": "I had my doubts that Sparrow + Wolf would impress me but it did.  My friend and I decided to do a few share plates at this nondescript,  non Asian restaurant in the middle of China town.  Here are some dishes that stood out to me - the kumato tomato tartine with truffle cream cheese on focaccia and added prosciutto, oh this was so good!  Such good flavor and texture all around! The duck confit and sweet potato dumpling were well executed and one of the better dumplings I've had recently.  The duck had good flavoring and the sweet potatoes were more muted in sweetness and more for texture inside the dumpling.  Next we had the lamb bolognese udon, which was a bit heavier dish but still worth mentioning because the flavor was on point and when do you get udon noodles with bolognese sauce right ? Lol... and we also ordered a white asparagus dish with nori and bernaise that was delicious as well.   The nori added a nice flavory note in this dish- kind of like when one adds furikake on their rice.  One dish I wasn't super excited about when I first read it on the dessert menu was their honey caramelized toast however -  this is the absolute best honey toast I've ever devoured!!  The fruit they used this time was in between a plum and an apricot I believe, and it really made what could have been a bit mundane dessert dish, fabulous!  Honey toasts are ubiquitous around China town but this one was head and shoulders above the rest, by far.  The menu changes here constantly so you will be pleasantly surprised by what the chef comes up with at Sparrow + Wolf.  Service was helpful, friendly, and always willing to give some suggestions to a first-timer like me.  Thank you for a wonderful dinner.",

The main issue besides small portions is there are no starches ,no fries, or mashed, no rice or a macaroni dish , wish they had a good duck fat French fry, they did not even serve bread and butter. The food was fantastic ,duck to die for,great salad,wonderful beef skewers with a amazing side of a homemade chutney and the wonton is a master piece delicious. But I rather go to Ron's steak house great food and plenty for the next day at a better value.  Went back today lots of delicious items like the artichoke, beef kababs , and rib bone were off the menu not enough items for a vegetarian either, what a shame.  We walked out went to Ron's instead",

We sat at the bar as the hostess told us that's the only way to enjoy their happy hour - they only have a drinks happy hour no more food HH like my friend had on her last visit.   The place looks really nice, it's small but feels inviting and most of the staff is pretty friendly.  We looked through the menu and it was a little hard to pick something as they don't have a lot of options but a lot of them were pretty tempting. I chose the Hamachi carpaccio and asked for a REALLY sweet drink -  I have the feeling our bartender heard something completely different when we talked about the drink because he gave me a really bitter drink he made with beer and whatever else he mixed with it.   The food and my drink presentations were, hands down, the best. Everything looked seriously beautiful!  I was so very pleased when I saw my carpaccio but when it came to the taste I was a bit disappointed. I felt like all the seasoning was done in the center of it and the edge parts tasted really plain (just raw fish with black pepper).  We ordered desserts and I ordered the Terrine while my friend ordered their Shortcake. Once again the presentation was awesome, but yeah the taste wasn't amazing to either of us. I did see other things I'd like to try on their Menu but I'm a little hesitant since everything I ordered - literally - disappointed me.  I still recommend this place if you'd like to try different drinks, they seem to have really cool ones here.",

    "text": "Once we got things sorted with the servers all was good.  We went for restaurant week. After looking over the menu, $50 for 3 courses of several dishes, we both decided to do the Prefix menu. The only issue was that my friend is allergic to mushroom. We asked our server if we could get it with no mushrooms, but they were adamant that the prefix menu could not be altered. If we wanted we could order from the regular menu, get the same thing for a much higher price and then customize. So then we decided that I would get the prefix and he would just order a couple ala carte items. Nope, also not an option. If anyone got the prefix menu then everyone had to get the prefix menu, because they portioned things out, just so. Had I gone alone they could've done a single person portion but because I was sitting at a table with another person, this was impossible (not totally sure why). We joked about staging a fake breakup and me moving to the next table so I could order my own prefix and he could order ala carte. After speaking with the server and manager who then spoke to the chef and then telling us \"no, sorry\" to any of our requests, they finally came back to say, \"ok, we can take the mushrooms out\".   For such an expensive restaurant, their customer service wasn't great. Had they not made an exception for one of the requests we probably would have left.   We stayed and had the restaurant week menu.   Starters- steak tartare, swordfish ceviche, romanesco   Starters were top notch. The romanesco was May favorite of the entire meal. Grilled cauliflower and broccoli with an amazing sauce. The ceviche was pretty good, I like a little more lime flavor, but good texture and a little sweet from some fruit I think. I'm not a huge fan of steak tartare but this was good and the bread to put it on was even better. Nicely buttered, browned and salted (the bread).   Entrees- scallops, lamb neck, grilled brocolini  Scallops were amazing. Perfectly cooked and nice sauce. Not a fan of the brocolini. It was a little too spicy and to stalky (maybe that's how brocolini is but I didnt really like it). Lamb neck was incredibly fatty. It was a huge serving but was about 60% fat (maybe edible, but not very appetizing)  the lamb had good flavor and a good sauce and the scallion pancakes that accompanied the meal were good.   Dessert - brown sugar cake with creme Freche, basil lime drizzle and strawberry compote.  Loved the strawberry compote. The cake was a bit chewy and too sweet for me (not a super sweets person).   All in all, if you don't have dietary restriction and like lamb and the other things listed, you will definitely leave full (we took a little container to go). It was a good way to taste a lot of different items that are much more expensive on the ala carte menu.   I'd probably go back just for the romanesco and maybe try some other items on the menu. But not overly impressed considering the seemingly elevated menu.",

    "text": "Old-world techniques of cooking over open fire, combine with lots of flavors from the neighborhood, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, chef Brian Howard creates some of the unique dishes that likes no others!   He spices things up on each dish that make guests guessing what's in there and why they found familiar taste but can't quite pinpoint!   Located in upscale Chinatown destination, where his cool spot is a destination for tourists and local alike.   I rarely get off the strip for dinner, almost never! Lunch i do  come to China Town in a heartbeat! But when I do leave the strip for dinner. This is the kind of place I would visit!  It's a little dark in the dining room make it hard for us to see all the beautiful dishes, so colorful, and spice up with flavors, but we managed with our iPhone lights. I wish I could see the dishes in better lightings because it's ashamed that you can't admire them before you eat  them.  We had a lot of Uni dishes, a lot of umami in each dish, a lot of chilis used in most of the dishes.   The baked clam was yummy. The Uni under buratta was a surprise. The mushroom was tasty. The Uni and Bacon sandwich-like was bomb! Don't forget to order the Tomato salad, was so refreshing and so different!   The hamachi was supposed to be famous! It wasn't my cup of tea! Somehow it was a bit too bland.  Our table favorite was the short rib Thai sticky glazed, it was delicious! We dissected the dish in minute! (See my photos! Our favorite dish of the night!)And that tasty potato that I have never had before!   So if you are sensitive to spices, and conservative in food, this is not the place for you.  However, if you are a True foodie where you love exploring and experience we things, this is the place you don't want to miss! This place is definitely worth a visit!  I heard Chef is opening another one soon next year! And will open for lunch, how exciting!",

The food was so flavorful and fresh, every single plate we ordered was phenomenal in its own way and the service was outstanding as well. The only complaint I have is that we were on such a tight schedule to make the show we were going to afterwards, that we couldn't savor and enjoy everything as much as we'd have liked- but 5/5 for service because we told our server about our time constraints and they were incredibly accommodating to us, bringing out each course as soon as we finished the last. Absolutely coming back next time I come to Vegas! The oysters and freshly baked bread were my favorite",

Boy was I wrong. Our server Jason was fantastic. He was really knowledgeable, friendly and super attentive. Everything we had was great except for the ocean parfait and the eclair fell short compared to the rest of the menu. The drinks were great as well. We really liked the Safeword.  We wanted to try the tasting menu but they don't offer it during the weekend. We ordered a la carte and the meal turned out great.   Parking was easy. I will be back on a weekday to try their tasting menu.",

The service, our waitress Sujie, the food, the ambiance were all amazing. We ordered the miso oysters, hamachi, beef tartare, beef cheek/ bone marrow dumplings, duck/ foie gras, and coconut beignets for dessert. From the start to the finish, everything was so delicious! I just wish they maybe served the lighter food entrees first to the more deeper flavorful entrees last, except for that though, just amazing. They even serve free wine with check in! I would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Went to sparrow and wolf with a party of 5 and it did not disappoint . I recommend making a reservation. When we arrived for our 8:30 reso the place was packed . It's a relatively small establishment with a smallish bar . When you walk in you I can see the chefs working on the dishes .   The restaurant is small and a little loud but that can be expected in a new hip foodie spot.   The service was a little slow we had to ask for water a few times . We also had to ask the server to remove empty plates and replace dishes with fresh ones .   We had ordered probably close to 75% of the menu.   The menu is small but explained very well by the service and the general manager when he delivers dishes has wonderful explanations of the dishes and also the restaurant as a whole.    Favorite dishes - beef skewers with crepe -duck - halibut - dumplings   Dishes I'll skip next time - chicken wings  - clams casino   -artichoke   The charcuterie plate was ok but we felt like cheese should also be on the plate although the cheese plate is on the dessert menu. We said we would just join both as a first course .   The drinks were on par with most libations at foodie spots .    I feel The goal is a social spot and we had a great time . There are no TVs in the restaurant or bar area  creating a more person to person social atmosphere .   Overall a great spot . The music that played throughout dinner was spot on . We had a great time and all said we would be back .",

    "text": "There is an old adage that a picture is worth 1,000 words however I will only need one to describe our meal and experience and that word is \"perfection\". We arrived 15 minutes ahead of our reservation as we could not wait to have our palettes pleased.  After a short wait we were sat and promptly approached to discuss libations.  We ordered a round of a Spring Mountain Sour (beet foam!!!), Where There's Smoke (mezcal), Model T (Gin/Cucumber) and a Jump the Shark (it's a shark shaped glass w/ bourbon!).  All of the drinks were so good we downed them (enjoyed them slowly....) and ordered a second round.  For starters, we went with 4 pieces of the Chinatown Clams Casino and the Hearth Baked Bread (as who isn't a sucker for in house fresh carbs).  The bread had the exact crunch you look for in a dinner roll / sauce picker upper.  More on that later.  The Chinatown Clams Casino were an interesting take as not everyone is an Uni fan, but it worked and I want more....like now.  For our entrees we decided it was best to order a smattering of items and pick them apart like vultures.  We ordered the Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings, Sweetbreads and Campfire Duck w/ wood ear mushrooms and a healthy portion of foie gras.  The flavors were all spot on so it will be hard to want to order anything else although the Big Ass Pork Shoulder passed our table and I think I drooled on the floor.  Just a little....don't judge.  Overall, we were all pleasantly filled and the minute I got home I opened their website and booked another reservation.  This is a great neighborhood (off the strip) gem that I hope succeeds and keeps their high quality of service and ingredients rocking.    Side Note: Very cool meeting Chef Brian Howard as he went around touching tables and it's always nice to share some moments with the curators of your culinary experience. We were running low on our bread over entrees and had a good amount of sauce leftover from the beef cheek and duck dish so Chef Howard brought us another bread on the house to help transport that delciousness into our bellies and we obliged.  Great meal.",

The food display is very creative and wow-ing. It was definitely snap/ig worthy!  All the dishes that we tried was very delicious. Tried the Beef cheek & bone marrow dumpling it was very tasty and on point. It did not taste or feel fatty with the bone marrow. The beef skewers were the best in my opinion. it was perfectly grilled, served with plain crepe to use as a \"tortilla wrap\" and topped with mango/chick pea salsa.  Also ordered the Chinatown Clams Casino which was clams on the half shell topped with fresh uni. This was very good must order! the lemon blueberry tart was a very good desert dish and it was not too tarty or sour at all.   I recommend coming to this place with at least 4 people so that you can order more items on their menu to try everything else. I wish i was able to try more items on their menu but we were full after a few dishes.   Service was awesome! will definitely want to come back to try more items on their menu.",

    "text": "We were there last night and mind you I wasn't very hungry but they really push hard for the family style. I do understand since this wasn't our first time here and that's how they work, but to force one person to do a family-style isn't really that great especially since I was just really there to meet my friends and get something small since I can't eat late at night.   The food was good. Some I wouldn't really pay $40 for but some were really awesome. The worst part is, they serve you loads of bread on every dish you order. It's seriously like buying bread with some itty bitty meat on the side. I think it's to compensate for the really small portions they serve. It's a great place to hang out with friends for a cocktail, but not so if you're hungry and you want a filling and extraordinary meal.  The server was ok, she didn't really talk much until that time she handed our check--she really spent at least 5 minutes talking to us and pretending to be interested. Well, she never gave us that during our first 1.5 h in the restaurant lol!   Hence,   1) you are paying for the ambiance since it's great 2) you'll eat a lot of bread, like 10% meat and 90% bread on your plate 3) area is convenient since it's situated where there's ample parking  4) not an extraordinary meal, but a great experience--don't expect it to be a place to crave to go to though imho :)",

Their food is a master piece and I really enjoyed how low key this place is too, far from the hustle and bustle of the strip. It was first time eating \"sweetbreads\" (pancreas) and I loved it a lot, it was so buttery and velvety. We also tried one of the specials that night which consisted of bone marrow, foie gras and escargot, need I say more - that dish was my favorite and I still dream about it! Great job guys, I really love it here and I can't wait to go back and try your other specialties. We also got some lamb udon and a few drinks. It was definitely one of the great eats of this city!",

    "text": "06/09/18 DINNER  I have lived in Las Vegas for 7.5 years. I have dined out quite often here, both on and off the Strip & Downtown. (I am not one of those locals that eschews the Strip, I'll go anywhere if it is enticing, and the Strip has been, many times.) I just finished posting all of the details of last night's meal at Sparrow + Wolf on my Facebook. I do not feel I have to do that here. I just came here to say this. Last night this restaurant served me one of the greatest meals I've ever had. And I've had incredible meals in the past, from all around the world. Wolfgang Puck (+Ed LaDou+Mark Peel+Nancy Silverton+...) in LA in 1982 3 weeks after the first Spago opened. Ken Frank at La Toque, in LA in the 1980s as well as Napa Valley in 2005. Pierre Gagnaire in LA in 1998, and in Paris in 2000. Charlie Trotter in Chicago in 1998. Thomas Keller at the French Laundry in 2006. Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park in 2009. And there have been others. And now Brian Howard has been added to my list. In addition to every dish being absolutely exquisite, the service was downright jawdropping, in that every single seat in the dining room and bar was filled, and yet the staff went out of their way to be attentive and friendly. If you come to Vegas and can only dine at one place for dinner, come here.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place a bad review because of all the accolades the chef has received, but I need to post this. We ate there just a couple of nights ago and were excited to eat off the strip at an upscale place. We ordered a couple of drinks and appetizers, then split some plates and ordered the skate fish plate. A guy came around twice and talked about how the food was prepared in detail and we really thought the service was excellent. My son was eating the skate fish and the first bite he said was incredible. After a while, he said his nose was on fire, almost as if eating wasabi at sushi. I put my fork into it and smelled it. I almost puked. It smelled like strong ammonia. I couldn't believe it. I asked a waitress who was new to get our head waiter. She asked what was wrong and I told her. She quickly took the plate back to the back room. She came out and said \"we are really sorry, we just had these flown in today, but 1 outta 10 could be bad\". Surprisingly, the waiter, the guy who told us about the food, nor the chef came out to apologize. Needless to say, once we all had a whiff, it ruined the rest of our dinner. They took the skate fish off the bill, but did not offer anything or even say an apology. In the end, we were really disappointed they didn't handle this better.  UPDATE - The chef reached out after I posted this review and expressed sincere regret of our experience. I am sure if there is an issue with the food next time, they will deal with it better.",

The interior is very dark and sheek and you feel cool just being in there.  The servers are all very kind and good at their jobs but this place is so loud and the table are so close together that it is very hard to hear them or really anybody else at your table for that matter.    My date and I got 5 dishes (including the bread): Campfire duck, Japanese sweet potato, Hamachi carpaccio, and II don't remember the last.  The bread was good but honestly had way too much crust which made it really hard to tear and chew.  The Japanese sweet potato wasn't really my thing but my date really enjoyed it.  It was honestly just a baked potato with slightly different flavorings.  The hamachi carpaccio was really interesting, in a good way.  The fish was very delicate and the roasted grapes were amazing.  I wanted so many more of those.  Also, there was something that made my tongue a bit numb, chili strands maybe?  Now, the campfire duck, this wasn't just the best plate of the meal, this wasn't just the best duck I have ever had, this was one of the best plates of food i have ever had.  It was simply blown away by it and could not stop crooning whenever I took another bite.  I ended up cutting the pieces into smaller and smaller bites so i could savor this as long as I could.  The mushrooms and sauce that went with it was also amazing.  Umami out the butt.  Seriously, I am salivating now writing about it.  GET THIS!  I would go back just for the duck and I would get multiple orders of it, seriously.",

Big ass pork shank - the pork is so tender!! The meat literally falls off the bone. 3. sweetbreads - This is very unique and flavorful dish. They use korean seasoning, so the dish has a spicy sweetness to it. 4. Udon - the ragu has a strong lamb flavor, which is perfect to me since i love anything lamb! 5. Spanish Octopus - tender with a nice grilled flavor on the octopus.  Notable runner ups are their beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, chinatown clams casino, hamachi, and oysters.  Also, don't forget to get their baked bread. Fresh baked and just perfect with the butter they serve!  For drinks, i love their have knives, will travel and their german slurpee cocktails.  The one thing I don't recommend is their bento box. It's pretty much a bento box of all their cured and raw selections. I just don't think charcuterie goes together with raw oyster, hamachi, and tartare. There's nothing special to the charcuterie selections offered, so for the price, I think better to get oyster, hamachi, or tartare alone.  The place is pretty small, so best to make a reservation. Happy hour is from 5 - 6 PM and offers good deals on food.",

    "text": "My first time here was after hearing over and over how this place was amazingly great. So, obviously, my expectations were very high. Which is possibly why my impression was not that...impressionable. When all I hear are amazing things which are not really deep rooted reviews, I tend to notice all the things WRONG. Which is human for me to do, I think.  So, onto my...impression.  Having been in the establishment previous to this, I can't help but to get the same feeling from it, which was not bad, it just isn't how this place tries to present itself (although, it was closed for renovations the day after I was here). I feel that the motif and decorations are going for a hearty, full and heavy impression, which is perfect for the cuisine. But, it seems like it's a mirage and once I looked closer, I could see the fragile egg shell foundation behind the mask. I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this part because, most people won't even understand why I'm pointing it out and it is easily fixed (hopefully in the renovation).   The process that my mind begins to notice this facade while its occurring during my dining, hits at about the same time I should be sinking into my chair in satisfaction of a good full meal, stellar choices from the menu, and elation knowing that it's time well spent. Instead, I'm juggling the thought that my food looks presentable and has interesting flavors but, is it merely a mask on budget ingredients? Just like the decor? So, this is why I didn't want to spend too much time on this because it really should be simple and...did I like it or not?   So, I'll just say that I liked it but wasn't super impressed. Value is a huge factor in all of my reviews. Meaning, if someone puts a 2 dollar garnish on fast food from Tom's burger joint and sells it for 20 dollars above cost and people love it because the garnish made it seem magical, great! That's literally how restaurants began. But, I tend to pay attention to where my money goes. I'm not trying to compare the food to fast food, it's not, I was just making an example. It was decent quality but with my harshness, I feel that this should be the STANDARD at all restaurants!   That being said, the server was very knowledgeable, attentive, and polite. Not the average (sadly) nowadays.  The food quality was good, fresh, and flavorful. Again, (sadly) not the average.  The items were fun, different, and interesting. Sadly not the average.   I would return. But, there's just such a long list of other places I have yet to try that it might be awhile. Plus, I'm visiting from L.A. so I don't make it to Vegas very often nowadays.",

Honestly, it seems like the portion were made for 2 but we ordered extra dishes on the side still.  Here are my highlights from here!  -Cocktail: Violet Beauregarde (the froth is amazing!)  -Steak Tartare (perfectly seasoned!)  -Hamachi Carpaccio (unique from other places and beautiful presentation)  -Charred Romanesco & Snow Pea (loved how it was prepared)  -Japanese Sweet Potato (salty and sweet!)  -Campfire Duck Breast (great quality!)  And I would order the Uni Melt just to try it once, but the bacon jam was a bit overpowering for you to taste the uni.   Now, the service is impeccable!

Just enough for one bite in your mouth. $7.50 each! Maybe 1 1/2 inch in size. From pic looks so big. Most dishes are tapas size. For their food I give a 3 stars and portion -5 stars.",

    "text": "Four of us enjoyed dinner at Sparrow & Wolf.  We sampled a good cross section of their menu, to begin with: oysters raw, oysters grilled with miso and lemon, oysters in Kizami Wasabi butter with celery root.  The oysters were delightful, clean and brilliant in taste.  The sauce in each case was subtle but did not overpower the taste of the oysters, and enhanced the experience. We had their hearth baked bread which was delicious and served piping hot.  Next, we tried the Ocean Parfait- Santa Barbara Sea urchin, with smoked trout roe and Kizami wasabi with toasted Nori.  Amazing taste combination that worked perfectly. The duck confit & sweet potato dumplings were scrumptious. The braised lamb neck was a highlight- cooked over a few days, the lamb was juicy and fall off the bones tender.  The fat was more like bone marrow. The Spanish octopus was served with tempura Maitake mushrooms and coconut and charred scallion.  The octopus was tender and tasty. We also enjoyed a foie gras that was so amazing we had to order it several times. The only menu item we were not in love with was the roasted bone marrow with seven chili and roasted peanut chutney.  The bone marrow as fine, but the seven-chili sauce was too overpowering and did not compliment the marrow. One of their special drinks was a lot of fun and a taste treat-  the Elephant in the Room.  Served in an elephant shaped mug, and included Opihr gin, watermelon, 5 spice pickle juice and mint.  I would not recommend the Omnipollo Imperial Stout, it was a chocolate and coffee beer, but the chocolate was so heavy it did not go as a beer with the meal. During the dinner John Anthony, a partner of Sparrow & Wolf came by to see how we were enjoying our meal.  Most personable and an excellent host indeed!  Our server was outstanding and very helpful with menu item choices. All and all, a fun, delightful and delicious experience we will be doing again.",

    "text": "Sparrow + Wolf has been ranked among the best restaurants in Las Vegas, and after eating there I would say it is with good reason.   I had two dishes, the uni melt and the lasagna. The melt was fantastic, a five star culinary treat. A few complementary flavors in the dish bolstered the experience. And at $12, it is actually reasonably priced.  The lasagna was quite good. Not quite the distinct experience of the uni melt but a very enjoyable entree, and quite filling--I had some the next day for lunch.  Despite being a trendy restaurant, the folks working there are not pretentious. Everyone with whom I interacted was friendly and down to earth. The bartender made some drinks that got rave reviews too, though I didn't have any of them.  Sparrow + Wolf is definitely a spot to check out.",

Libations- \"Scotty doesn't know\" and \"Tea Thyme\" Both we're balanced and delightful. Food- We had Hamachi Carpaccio, Kumato Tomato Salad, Chinatown Casino Clams, Roasted Bone Marrow, Wood Roasted Miatake Mushrooms, A-5 Wagyu Skewer special, and Black Bass special.  EVERYTHING was delicious and unlike anything I've had before.  The Japanese flair added to each dish created umami flavors incomparable to traditional fair.

    "text": "I like the current trend of those hybrids that seem to be come combination of a refined bar and a upscale restaurant, the ones that offer new American cuisine.  I like the casualness of the bar along with decent craft brew offerings, but I also like good and inventive food.  Is this what people call a \"gastropub\".   When I read about Sparrow + Wolf (what's with the \"+\" - how long will it be before restaurants are named by emoji's?), I wanted to give it a try.  The craft beer selection is small, which is not bad if it means they're turning the kegs over at a decent rate.  I had the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings.  They were very good.  The fillings of the dumplings was like a pate, soft, unctuous, and with a savory, meaty flavor.  A couple of complaints.  The music is very loud, so normal conversation isn't possible.  Second, the restaurant is dark, another current trend.  However, the plates are also very dark with high rims which make it difficult to see.  A compliment: the staff, everyone, was super friendly and helpful. Normally, all of this would garner four-plus (or, as the restaurant might say four+) stars.  But my companion couldn't stop raving about her dish, a smoked beet salad.  She said it was one of the best things she's eaten in a long while.  She wanted a spatula to scrap up every ort.  She got orgasmic about it.  I thought she was going to have Meg Ryan - Katz Deli moment.  So for that, it's getting all five stars.",

Called ahead to ask if we needed reservation and hostess highly recommended yes. Made a reservation and when we showed up, we were offered the bar cuz there was no table set aside for us (defeats my reservation?)..After we sat at the bar, we saw the happy hour menu (we were also not informed when we called at 5pm that there was happy hour).  Personally I think it's quite important for a new restaurant to inform their customers events, promotions, and specials.  Decor and ambience was hip.  They definitely invested time and money, it's well thought out!! Loved all the little details.   We ordered Clams Casino..$7.50 a clam with the smallest Uni on top. (Photos on Yelp had much larger Uni) both my husband and I barely had any clam, I had 2 large bits of mushroom and bacon instead.  Lamb Tartare needed some kinda kick.. like more red onions or capers or something acidic.. the curry powder in the bread just isn't enough flavor to wow us.  Bone Marrow dumpling was a beautiful and visually appetizing plate.  Though the dumpling dough is too thick, the flavor is not bad. But still mediocre   Beef skewer was my fave tonight because the beef was a perfect medium rare, just how I like it.  Taste was more flavorful than the rest. Again, does not exceed expectation  My husband wanted to refresh with a mojito.  It wasn't the best and it wasn't chilled enough.   I wish I could really like this place cuz I live close by and love to bring outa town friends to new places but it's very hard for me to Want To recommend it right now, especially for the price, we really expected to get mind blown.",

    "text": "As soon as we walked into the restaurant, the first thing I noticed is how hot it is inside the restaurant. It is uncomfortable. The restaurant is small and quite boring. There are ceiling fans going but it's not helping. The ambience is nothing to write home about, and all I see is a bunch of people getting mixed drinks at the bar. Therefore, I think this is a great place if you like to drink. As we walked in, with reservations, we were placed at a very uncomfortable small table right next to where the waiters have their water pitchers and likely put their orders in. We request a different table, preferably a booth, and it is not available. We accept a different table, but it too is positioned in such a way that, when the restaurant is full, there is no ability to move your chair around without hitting the chair of the person behind you. We look at the menu and have to ask how it works. As we look at the menu, we start laughing, realizing that this restaurant charges five dollars for bread and butter. Really? Unfortunately, nothing on the menu seemed appetizing. Initially, I thought let's try a couple of things on the menu to see what they're like. My friend and I decided to opt against that for the following reason: the restaurant was not full... Probably only a quarter full... And it was so hot in there. So uncomfortable and so stuffy. With the incredible variety of options in Las Vegas, we chose to simply get up and leave, which we informed the hostess of so she could give the table to someone else, should they need it. I was really excited about trying this restaurant. The disappointment that I felt as soon as I walked into this restaurant... I would not try to come back to this restaurant, nor will I recommend it to any friends. For me, the ambience and comfort of a restaurant is as important as the food that is coming to your table. Simply not recommended.",

We realized when we walked in the door that the AC in the front of the restaurant was lacking. The hostess assured us it was cooler in the back of the restaurant.  Unfortunately it wasn't and all four of us had a very sweaty and uncomfortable night.  If the food would have not been so great we would have walked out.  I've never drank so much water to stay cool and hydrated at dinner before.  All of us got up after dinner with sweaty clothes! Not a great way to enjoy a night out with friends. We won't be back!",

When we arrived, it was very busy with almost every table filled up. It was also really loud in there, and I had to almost yell to talk to the person next to me. We tried a few of the cocktails, and the Spring Mountain Sour and Jump the Shark were pretty good. The Sour had beet foam in it which was unusual but worked well with the drink. We also got the Where There's Smoke, and while I usually like a little smokiness flavor, this was like drinking actual smoke. A little much.  The food was phenomenal! We got a few things to share. The grilled Spanish octopus was very tender, and the beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling was tasty as well. I love scallops and these were amazing with corn and miso butter, SO flavorful. We also loved the udon and the \"big ass pork shank\". The crispy skin itself was delicious. I didn't expect to like the beef skewer but the vadouvan crepe that came with it worked so well with the beef, and the whole dish exuded so much flavor. For dessert, we had the calamansi tart and honey toast. They do a different take on honey toast, but it was fantastic. I wanted another.  Overall, good food and good service. I'll come back to try more stuff!",

Any pictures you have seen of this great restaurant do it absolutely no justice it is quite smaller than it looks and much warmer than it appears through photography it is welcoming for any people of any age it is truly a neighborhood restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant with a brief tour and sitting down our server took our drink order and sadly it took over 22 minutes to receive our cocktails. While they were fantastic, that time was just a little bit too long for comfort. It would take too many pages to describe all the food that my party had last night I believe we ordered 22 of the 25 dishes the restaurant served. I personally wanted to love every single one of them while some were exceptional some fell short of the mark.  But as I stated before I do understand opening restaurant bumps and I know these will be mended as time goes on. The best way to describe last night's evening is the wild beautiful powerful stallion was finally let loose and is finally able to do his own thing after being kept cooped up in the barn for so many years. This restaurant has nothing but a phenomenal future in front of it and I personally wish the chef and its entire staff nothing but great things that will absolutely be on the horizon for them as they continue to show the passion on each plate of food  and attention to service.",

We walked in and the hostess asked if we had a reservation, when we said no, they said the next table would be be available until 9:30 so we said it was too long and started to walk out.  That's when we noticed Chef Brian come out and verify with the hostess that there was indeed no tables. As we stepped out of door trying to figure out where else we could go, Chef Brian came out if we would like to sit in kitchen. We said sure and the took a few minutes to set up a couple spots at the center counter.  The food was fantastic and Chef Brian served us himself, describing every dish as he brought them out.  Every dish we ordered was fantastic and there wasn't a single thing we didn't like and had so much fun. Every dish we saw being made made me want to try it.",

Beef check & bone marrow dumplings left us in a euphoric sublime culinary daze. Holy F*ck those are incredible!!!

Since I was facing a wall that's all I could see. I think it has the potential to look really classy hipster which is what I think they were going for. I'd like to return again when maybe they've been open for some time and have had a little more time to get things just the way they want.",

We all shared our dishes so I tasted so many foods that I couldn't pronounce and had sweetbreads for the first time in my life. The flavors are indescribable  and all the servers were friendly and attentive. The drinks were all yummy and each one looked so tempting.  It was an awesome experience!  Opening night was a success and I wish them great things because Vegas needs great food off the strip.",

Chef Brian should be much more famous than he is.  The place is a little small, so I'd suggest avoiding the dinner rush, but their were plenty of seats after the rush was over on our one visit.  If there's one thing working against this place, it's location in Chinatown may be scaring away the round-eyes... but it's totally worth the trip.",

It was hard to get a seat at the bar as we didn't have reservations and the bar was even reserved for the night.  Luckily, the owner Brian made an accommodation for us at the bar as we were just going to order drinks and would not be staying for dinner.  I'm so glad he did this for us.  The experience was amazing!!  We will definitely be back and if that is on the weekend, we will make reservations next time.  We look forward to trying the food as it is unique and looked fantastic.  And a big shout out to Jackie and Sarah the GREAT tenders of the bar!!  See you soon!  M&M",

First some grilled Miso and lemon oysters, and although oysters are generally better enjoyed raw, it was great. We followed with a swordfish ceviche, a little salty, but fresh and well seasoned. Some delicious pan roasted scallops, and grilled bone marrow; spicy and aromatic. The two main dishes were a backed whole snapper (special not on the menu), the best fish we've had in Vegas hands down, and braised lamb neck, so soft that the meat comes off the bone instantly, marinated in some amazing caramelized sauce! Truly every single dish was excellent, specially the last two! It's True the check was much higher than what we usually like to spend on a diner, but what's pricey for us might be pocket change for others...",

    "text": "I have been to sparrow and wolf three times so far, their inventive ever changing menu with high quality ingredients keeps briging me back. This last time I went, was the first time since I stopped drinking. My body just did not respond well to it at all anymore,  and it was not worth feeling terrible for days after just a drink.  However,  it made me so sad because while I was never a heavy drinker, I really do enjoy a drink with a nice meal, and sparrow and wolf bar far has served me some of the best cocktails I have ever had.   I asked if there was any possibility that they might have a mocktail option for me.  My server very diligently asked all the flavor profiles I didn't like and did like,  I also told him the two drinks I had there I loved in the past.  My past favorite drinks were the wooden shoe, and you can prevent forest fires.  They then brought me this very elegant yuzu forward drink! I have been searching for a good mocktail all these months and they were the first to get it right! Also they made me like oysters ! It's only happened one other time in Portugal on the dang beach lol their grilled miso butter oyster is everything.  I basically licked the  inside of the shell.  Now since their menu changes you can't guarantee what you enjoyed will be there again, but my top favorite items are..   The campfire duck, perfectly cooked duck with foi gras and mushroom in a sauce that is bursting with umami flavor.  China town clams casino,  such a great spin on a classic! Lap cheong and uni on a clam! Yes please!  The ocean parfait, creamy uni nestled in a warm creamy sea of magic.  Super unique,  and for sure not for someone who has issues with texture, or  does not share my extreme love of uni.    Steak tartar,  so full of flavor,  so fresh,  and the garlic bread paired so well.  Way more hearty and filling then I thought it would be. The egg always made me wary,  but I'm glad I finally tried it.   Halva ice cream with warm beignets in a yuzu sauce. Creamy,  cool,  acid,  finished with a warm hug.   Chocolate miso eclair with a gingerbread crumble.  Super rich and decadent but so many fun flavors.   There's very few items I didn't fully feel,  and only two I disliked.   The hamachi carpaccio is a story of highs and lows,  some of the fish its self, apart from the dressing, was full of flavor and other parts had no taste.  Also while the fried garlic added a unique contrast, it started to take over,  and left a very lasting taste in your mouth.   Buddha claw creme brulee.  The custard had curdled a bit so it was not smooth and creamy and for sure was not zest peices.  It had been a bit clumsy in general. I liked the concept but execution lacked.   Soothsayer cocktail,  took two sips and then no more.  It was terrible and cloying.  Didn't taste all the lovely layers I was anticipating.   The white chocolate terrine with flourless chocolate cake and pear sauce.. Confused me not really any white chocolate to be seen,  super dense cake layered with some type of nut or seed butter and dots of pear sauce.  Just so heavy,  kinda gets mucky and stuck in your mouth.   Overall they have so many highs and they make me so excited about food, so in the end they get 5 stars.  When you experiment with food as often as they do, it's hard to not once and a while have something that does not stick. The bill each time for two before tip has ranged from about 100-120, and I left feeling very satiated.  The plates range from tapas size to large appetizer.  The only exception currently I know of is their bachan porterhouse,  one is a meal for 2 and is about 85 dollars last time I checked.  The decor is fun,  and the sound levels can be a bit high for my taste.  If you have a relative who is hard of hearing,  or a date you want a quiet romantic dinner this is it.  If you want to fill yourself with unique food inventions and awaken your palate,  in a more vibey gastropub then this spot is for you.",

Authentic Menu with beautiful and one of a kind cocktails. Menu is intended for sharing so we did just that. Tried 4 options and shared.

Service: we made a reservation but didn't need it, and honestly walking in I was skeptical because of the decor and it wasn't very crowded for being 6pm on a Friday night (I was soon proved very wrong). We were greeted warmly, sat promptly, and our waiter was very attentive.   We were all QUITE hungover so I snagged a few things of water before they could get to us. The waitstaff were good sports about us needing our one watering hole.  Food: none of us were sure what to order until our waiter told us the specials...4 of the 5 of us immediately committed to the 32 oz Rib Eye! Our fifth friend got a fish entree, but I honestly wasn't paying much attention to hers. the Rib Eye was PHENOMENAL. My friend and I ordered it medium-rare and only left 2 slices on the plate. I love that it came with 3 sauces (red chili, red curry, and chimichurri), grilled naan, and small dishes of button mushrooms, cauliflower, fried rice, broccolini, eggplant, cucumber, and a house specialty taste of potatoes. Each accompaniment was seasoned, cooked, and served individually.   We all got a complimentary glass of wine (thank you, Yelp check-in deal!) but weren't up for much drinking...until later that night because Vegas lol. I saw that Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label was by the glass and asked about it; was assured by the waiter that it was okay several times but later told this wasn't the case. I wasn't surprised but was disappointed by his False confidence. This was only a small factor out of the whole experience.   Location: not on the strip but neither was where we stayed so this wasn't a problem. If you're staying on the strip and looking for a more low-key setting that totally delivers quality- this is it!",

We were sat at the bar and immediately greeted by a friendly bartender who was incredibly knowledgeable on both the cocktail and dining menus.   Everything looked delicious so we decided on the 'Bento Box', a little discouraged by it being $75, but when it arrived we were definitely not disappointed with both its quality and quantity for the two of us to share. A wide variety of oysters, charcuterie (multiple types of meat and cheese), some of the biggest and most delicious prawns I've ever had, the swordfish aquachile was insane! Also some great pate and grilled fresh bread.   They have a very unique cocktail list, with both sweet and savory cocktail options - the 'elephant in the room' with the pickled watermelon was very tasty, and the lychee spritz which was refreshing but not overly sweet. The 'pretty bird' featuring elderflower and the 'tea thyme' Jameson's based cocktail with Smokey earl gray was compliment-able both aromatic and flavorful.   It's a great restaurant off the strip for Las Vegas locals, and for people who want to go in and enjoy their dining experience, instead of being rushed in and out as many on strip restaurants do.",

It is, but for damn good reason. This place is amazing, from the service of every single staff (their smiles and genuine eye contact/care) to the actual food and ambiance itself. We started with the Charred Romanesco, Barbecued Salsify, and Steak Tartar. All so amazing. But the salsify especially. Then we moved onto the Scallops, Wood Fired Lasagna, and their special for the evening which was a Truffle Burger. Can't say enough good things about these dishes. We even ordered two more burgers and an additional lasagna.. definitely share dishes when you go! That way you can try more since it's all so good. Every piece of this experience was amazing. Especially the attentiveness from the staff. It's an intimate experience and you feel truly cared for while you're here! Thanks guys!",

I'm glad I decided to take the husband here for Valentines Day.  The romantic ambiance was perfect for the occasion.  I don't recall our server's name but she was freaken amazing.  She was so thorough and gave us the rundown on how they serve their food.  She explained how all the dishes are meant to be shared so that you have the opportunity to taste everything.  Honestly the husband and I were a bit worried since the portions are on the small side.  BUT definitely not lacking on flavor.  After going thru a few dishes, I actually appreciated the smaller portions, surprisingly.  Now for the food, like I mentioned above, our server was great. So great in fact, that while she was going into details about the dishes, my mouth started to water.  I couldn't wait to start eating.  We did try a few items which you can't go wrong with any of them.  Now, let me say that I am not an uni fan but after trying their OCEAN PARFAIT and CHINATOWN CLAMS CASINO, I am now.  At first I was a bit hesitant on the Ocean Parfait when she described it as \"a burst of ocean flavor,\" but decided to get it anyway and I am so glad we did.  It was delicious and with the different textures of the uni, roe, and foam and the hint of wasabi, it all came together perfectly.  I didn't realize the clams had uni on it til it came and the husband made a comment about it.  But the combination of the uni and the bacon and bread crumbs were also perfect.  Bottom line, the uni was delicious on both dishes.    Since we were out for a special occasion, we decided to splurge a little bit and went with the DRY AGED PORTERHOUSE.  The porterhouse is served with a bunch of banchan sides.  Many of them, I didn't care for but the meat was tender and juicy.  If you're a big meat eater, you would probably love this one.  The porterhouse was huge.  We definitely got full afterwards.  Next time, we probably will not go with the porterhouse, cause like I said it was a lot of meat.  Even my meat eater husband said next time we won't get this.  But thats not to say it wasn't delicious, it was.    Now, since we decided to splurge and go for the porterhouse, we were so full that we couldn't enjoy their desserts.  One regret of mine, cause I love desserts.  Next time I will make sure to make room for desserts.  But yes, we will definitely be back.  If you haven't been, you need to go!  You won't be disappointed.  I'm looking forward to our next visit!",

They took her credit card and did a hold for $25 a person with a 48 hour cancellation policy. Her flight was delayed thus creating a shift in her plans for the weekend. She called 28 hours prior asking to cancel and they charged her $150 for the cancellation.  A Friday night in June. Not a holiday, not a party of 30, not even a strip property during convention season.   I have been in this town my entire life and have worked for large corporations with fine dining restaurants and have NEVER experienced ownership and management not being understanding of situations.   Shame on you and your greed. As a local Las Vegas restaurant, do better.",

Traveling to Las Vegas from Chicago, I made a reservation for 6 people at 8pm on Friday 6/21. I put a credit card down and agreed to their 48 hr cancellation clause, which is $25pp. They let me know that although I had a reservation for 6 people, I could adjust the # of guests prior to the reservation without penalty.  When my flight to Las Vegas from Chicago was cancelled and I had to get a flight a full day later, my plans in Las Vegas shifted, and I unfortunately had to cancel dinner. Still more than 24 hours in advance (but not within their 48 hour policy), I let them know, hoping that they could make an exception given my circumstances. Zero exceptions made. And even though they said the # of people could be adjusted, they still charged me the FULL $150 ($25pp for 6 people) for cancelling.  I understand that this is a highly sought after restaurant, but not even restaurants on the strip have this strict of a policy. Zero exceptions made for circumstances out of my control, due to weather and travel, for a restaurant of this caliber, is unheard of. Shame on you Sparrow and Wolf.",

    "text": "This was probably one of the best culinary experiences I've had. As someone said in the review, the staff is fun and passionate. They are also super knowledgeable and personable. John, one of the owners, does a great job running the front. He stopped in at our table a number of times, took the time to explain things to us and then entertained us with his wittiness.  What was interesting was our dynamic. We had some people who were not adventurous eaters and others, like myself, who were. In the end, everyone agreed this was one of the best meals they've ever had.  I'm not sure if I should start or end with the star of the night so I'll just go in order of what we got. The hamachi carpaccio, oysters, octopus and the broccoli were all excellent starts to our meal. I'd like to specifically mention the octopus as one of the best I have had - fresh (never frozen we learned, and grilled perfectly). What I thought was the star was the gnocchi dish - absolutely fantastic. If we didn't have anything else I would have been completely happy with this dish. We also ordered the shoulder which turned out to be of a fish and not of a pig! haha. Still, just another excellent dish we had. And finally, the grand finale and best dish of the night and, in my personal opinion, the best steak I've ever had was the porterhouse marinated in miso grilled to perfection and had a flavor I've never experienced before. By far, the best I've had and most memorable!  I've seen studies that when you are in a good mood and having a good time and the people around you are fun that everything tastes better than if everything was status quo. All of these things happened - the staff made it fun and memorable, our group had a lot of laughs, but I don't believe in this case any of that affected how good the food actually was. The food would have been this good even if I were in a bad mood and I'd still want to come back because it was THAT good! Yes, that steak will forever be etched into my memorable as I search for another to overtake the top spot! It just might not happen!",

    "text": "I am completely BLOWN AWAY by everything SPARROW + WOLF! Everything from the menus to atmosphere and everything in between was ON POINT! What I love the most about this place is the superb service you would find in a fine dining restaurant brought to you in a neighborhood type atmosphere. Jason and Destiny made it feel homey with a flare. I didn't think it was possible but they pulled it off gracefully. Jason walked us through the menu and did it with his own little quirks so his knowledge and appreciation of the menu and food really showed. The menu is setup to share and believe me when you taste the items and see the presentation of them, you'll want to try everything.  Drinks = Safeword : the OM chocolate sea salt caught my attention but the pineapple rum and hazelnut orgeat kept me sipping on my libation all night. James Brown old fashioned - the hardest working old fashion there is : I mean if the name of the drink doesn't entice you, neither will this drink. The drink is as bold in flavor as it's name.  Food = Steak tartare was finely chopped and when mixed with the confit egg and topped on the accompanied toast is a great appetizer dish.The Hamachi Carpaccio was topped with a citrus fruits and grapes is so devine, you'll wish you ordered one for yourself to enjoy alone. My favorite was the Chinatown Clams Casino and even though it was topped with Uni which I was unsure about, the other accompanying flavors of bacon, bread crumbs and the hollandaise sauce quickly let me forget the Uni dollop was there. The clam is diced up into pieces which makes it easier to eat and enjoy. For the main dish, we ordered the Duck Confit & Sweet Dumpling and the Wood Fired Lasagna. One bite of the succulent dumpling and you'll be hooked. I promise. The duck is shredded and placed in the dumpling and placed on a pond of sauce that has a little punch of spice. The wood fired lasagna was delivered with crunchy miso rubbed toasts. The baked burrata chese on top of the lasagna made this dish a delightful way to end the night.   Atmosphere = the dim lighting makes this place cozy and the playlist was an icing on the cake for a good time. There are creative art works to take in.   NOTE: START WITH DESSERT. We enjoyed so many savory dishes that I felt awful for not trying any of their desserts and I AM A SWEETS person.",

Andrew, our bartender, was as charming as he was deft at his craft.  For my cocktail, I ordered the The Golden Negroni, an off menu special, a clever blend of gin and a German Riesling. It was a refreshing concoction on a hot Vegas night; a perfect balance of crispness and sweetness in much the same way as bitting into a fresh picked apple. My husband's barrel-aged Old Fashioned was refined masculinity in a glass.  For our dining pleasure the three of us shared the Japanese sweet-potato as a prelude to our dinner. It was rich and salty from the crumbled bacon atop and the potato was creamy and decadent. Elevated comfort food at it's finest.   For our main courses my husband had the sweetbreads, our friend had the duck and I ordered the grouper. The grouper was a delicious meaty fish perfectly seasoned  and cooked beautifully. Our friend's duck was plated with skillful elegance and also cooked expertly to a perfect rare. My husband raved over his meal as well. All of our meals displyed the thoughtful restraint of the chef whom allowed the food to shine by not over-complicating the dishes.   We finished the evening by sharing the strawberry rhubarb shortcake and chocolate peanut butter torte special. Both desserts were sublime. The shortcake was sweet & tart and the house made whip was fantastically  creamy. The torte topped with a cherry compote was sinfully decadent.  I look forward to our next visit.",

We went in for dinner this last weekend with a party of 8 women lol as soon we walked in Terry the bartender took excellent care of us. Specialty cocktails and the classics were great. He even made us wonderful shots through out the evening. My favorite was the spiced pear he served us with dessert that included the blueberry tart, pot de creme, strawberry rhubarb shortcake, and honey toast. All where delicious.  But back to dinner. We tried a bit of everything and shared it all pretty much. The bone marrow dumplings, steak tartare, and beet apple tartare are some of my favorites. The beet apple tartare went well in my opinion with some of the richer dishes. If you get the dumplings ask for some of their fresh baked bread. The sauce and juices from the dumplings is too good to waste. The short rib, lasagna, mitake mushrooms, scallops, and mussels are also delicious. The entire meal was the highlight of our trip.   Completely inconspicuous spot but will definitely be going back in September to try the duck, hamachi, and the sweet potato. Escape the Las Vegas strip for a night you won't regret it!!",

    "text": "I have had Sparrow & Wolf bookmarked to try for quite some time. I called a couple of different times trying to get same day reservations, but with no luck. (I am terrible at planning out my food more than a day in advance. Who knows what they want to eat tomorrow? Not me!) Anyway this time I called and they said they could seat us at 5:15 or 9:30.... ugh, I was desperate to try them so I took the 5:15.  We arrived on time, and were seated immediately as more than half the restaurant was empty. They did just open at 5:00 though. I had done my research, read reviews on Yelp, and knew going in there were some must have dishes. I was a bit disappointed though that some of the items I wanted were not available, their menu is seasonal, which is understandable, but still disappointing. No Argentinian Red Shrimp, or Butcher Wings in the fall I guess.  We started with the Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings and the Homemade Bread and Butter. Both were delicious and I highly recommend the combination as the bread is fabulous at soaking up all the delicious broth from the dumplings. Our entrees were the Campfire Duck and the Udon with Lamb Bolognese to which I added an egg. Both were delicious! I have absolutely no complaints over the quality of the food what so ever. I did feel like it took an extra long amount of time for the food to come out, both the appetizers and then the entrees. But it was definitely worth the wait.  I was a little irritated at the fact that even as we were leaving the restaurant almost half the tables were still empty. Either they had a whole lot of no shows that night or they could have gave us a better dinner reservation time. I do recommend this place as a great \"date night\" restaurant. Just make sure and call a couple of days ahead to make your reservation.",

And to top it off, they charge their menus regularly, so it keeps it exciting.   For this visit, we started off with their charcutterie plate. If you like spicy sausage, you'll love the thinly sliced hunters sausage. We also had their pate, which went well with the onion marmalade. And slices of their cows milk cheese; nothing really special, but good.  Now, their beef dumplings in celery foam is more what this restaurant is about. The flavors were unique, on top of the preparation. Everything was just so well balanced, and I believe the bone marrow was in Au jus. Amazing.   For the entree, I went wood fired lasagna with miso and burrata. It retrospect, I should've realized it was going to be kinda soupy. Still, the flavors were delicious. And the accompanying garlic bread was perfect in between bites. It was also nice the owner came over to see how we were enjoying our meal.  Unfortunately, the food was so good, I didn't save room for dessert. I totally could've gotten down for a sweet finisher.",

The bar program barrel ages cocktails and the Old Fashioned I ordered was really good. They're quite cheeky and serve a super refreshing gin-based cocktail called What The Duck in a bathtub shaped cup/glass. Very amusing and good. We ordered an assortment of shared dishes. The standouts were the seared scallops, steak tartare, uni melt (housemade focaccia and burrata used to make a grilled cheese sandwich topped with uni and a side of bacon jam), and the housemade charcuterie. I was not a fan of their beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling...it was boring and didn't have the flavors I was expecting.",

The libations (cocktails) are always consistent and balanced, hand crafted by their talented mixologist. I'm not only referring to their cocktail recipes but classic cocktails, such as my favorite boulevardier with scotch instead of whiskey (you'd be surprised how many bartenders can't properly make this drink). I love that the manager or chef come around and talk to the guests.  They engage by asking if we, the guests, have questions about the menu.  They help with suggestions and pairings enhancing the dinning experience.   I've been here 3 times, every time I leave impressed and satisfied.  I would recommend this spot to locals and tourist, to anyone who enjoys dining, food, mixology, and wants to stay off the strip.",

We started with the hearth baked bread and absolutely loved it- I really love that they are doing their own bread for service! We also had the farm egg, bento (amazing spread- highly recommended), cheek & marrow dumplings, campfire duck, calamansi tart, honey toast, and beignets. The price point is great for what you get. The duck was by far my favorite dish- flavor was perfectly balanced, with the dumplings in close second. I will definitely back for future business dinners.

We found the food to be interesting and good quality, also reasonably priced for what it is. +Hearth Baked Bread - Ridiculously good for just bread.  It's something you can share between 2 people, any more then that and you should just get another order.  The bread is incredibly crisp and delicious. +Argentinean Red Shrimp - That sauce yummy!  The shrimp itself is sweet and grilled to perfection but that buttery sauce it's cooked in is the real winner +Udon - It smells really gamey and I was a little put off, however when I took a bite, it didn't taste gamey at all.  The lamb has a great depth of flavor and the olives really add a lot to it.  I normally don't even like olives. +Beef Check & Bone Marrow Dumplings - Beautifully plated and wonderful flavor.  However I would not again order the Lamb Udon and this dish since they are both gamey meats, they tasted quite similar.  I'd get one or the other and order a different dish to go along with it next time.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a little adventure in your dining, try Sparrow + Wolf.  It's an odd name for a restaurant but then the food is a little outside the box too.  I would label it a dining experience as you will probably end up ordering things you didn't first expect when perusing the Menu.  Order a chilled glass of Australian Vetliner wine and try the oysters.  Then move through the menu to other delights.  You might end up drinking a bit more of their excellent wine than you anticipated as you nibble on a charcuterie plate or other delicious items.  Of course, a restaurant is not great without great service, and Sparrow + Wolf  has great service.  The servers are knowledgeable and attentive without being pushy.  Midway through our meal tonight, our table was wiped down so as to make it fresh. Who does that?  When you finish dining and walk out of the restaurant after a very enjoyable evening, you might adkyourself who came first, the Sparrow or the Wolf?  You'll then realize that YOU came first, the patron with a smile on your face...",

I feel like I was supposed to like this place. Nice and hip decor, smells were terrific, tastes were...mediocre.   Halibut was overcooked and rubbery...nevermind the dish-by-dish. Everything had fresh ingredients but the flavors were a near-miss.   Cocktails were well-crafted. (See what I did there?)",

    "text": "We have been to sparrow + wolf five or six times.  This is the restaurant you should go to if you are looking for the place where discerning locals go.  If you are a party of two sit at the bar.  The bartenders are exceptional both in terms of their delivery of drinks and in their food recommendations.  Bigger parties should still go--the service is excellent throughout the dining room.  There is a very fun semi private area for larger parties.   But you come for the food. And you will not be disappointed.   Although the menu changes it's always worth looking for any raw seafood dish(hamachi carpaccio is outstanding) as well as any organ meat--excellent sweetbreads.  This evening we had tempura oyster that was the definition of a perfect bite--the oyster still crisp, the tempura light and the nectarine and wasabi accompaniment the perfect set off. The kitchen also has a great approach to vegetables.   We had a tomato cucumber salad that was a great expression of late season tomatoes and just the thing we wanted.   Go here.  You won't be disappointed and I think you will be delighted.",

Im glad We went  Friendly folks  Relaxing atmosphere   Why only three stars.   I guess it's because while I like  Oysters, for instance, I prefer the oyster to be the predominant flavor. Not something put on it.   We tried the chefs special taste plates. 65/ person   It's good food.   Just too many flavors per bite to enjoy.   It's Just too good for me.    Ps. Fried cauliflower was ..... uninventive compared to the rest of the culinary art.   Also. We were served duck.  Now I've had duck in Alaska. ( akaja is not known fir its culinary artisans) population doesn't support !  But the duck here was exceedingly strong, and..... Awful.  Spit it out.   would I come back. .... probably not.

For one they don't close at 1am and my group was rushed to order immediately. They also don't offer the same menu featured which is uncomfortable for someone trying to plan an evening out. Their profile says American but I wouldn't call their food American at all; these use Japanese noodles and Whiskey and those are just the items I noticed. This Is NOT a place for large parties whatsoever; at the end the server dropped a large bill on the table and leaves it up to the guests to figure out the payments absolutely taking away from the experience. All and all we wanted to try a new place for my friends 30th and it didn't go as planned. I can see how a date night would be nice here but that's about it.",

    "text": "From the moment you walk in and see directly into the open kitchen you are greeted by a warm friendly and well informed staff. John Anthony and the staff are engaging and can tell you anything you need to know about the food from farm to table. The room is built around the kitchen and it's very unique looking so there's plenty to see in here as well. The music playlist impresses immediately as I heard music I loved sandwiched between unfamiliar tunes that made me stop and listen. We began simply with the charcuterie and cheese plates and every item was not only visually great to look at but delicious and fresh tasting. Presented on unique trays, one of which was a very cool petrified wood platter. These were Some of the best meats and cheeses I've tasted in a long time and we went with chefs suggestions which all paired up perfectly. We followed it up with the Farm Egg and Artichoke dishes (I can't recall the official names of the dishes but they were very well thought out and put together). Both were stellar and involved layers of flavors that evolved with each bite. The Farm egg dish changed as we dove deeper into it and got richer with each bite of egg asparagus and spices that got warmer along the way as the ingredients mixed together more. Both John and our server were attentive throughout the meal and also gave us as much time as we needed to enjoy each course...suggesting just the right accompaniments and drinks along the way.  We then had the beef cheek dumplings (again just my loose description of the dish which included many other tasty ingredients) and they were very satisfying and hearty and delicate at the same time. Really a great balance in this dish. Like everything that was served to us the presentations were all beautiful and appealing the the eye, so you just want to look at the food for a while before you dig into it but it all tasted as good if not better than It even looked. Chef Howard took the time to stop by to check on us during the meal even though he was hard at work in the kitchen all evening with a full room. We then finished off with the Halibut and the Udon Lamb Bolognese and again both were filled with thoughtful and delicate textures and flavors that both satisfied and entertained my palette. There were plentiful unique Flavor combinations that were new to me but evoked a familiar comfort and within each dish was a subtle unfolding of new flavors as I would dig deeper into each dish...making it a really fun food experience as well. It was an excellent first experience and I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

I saw the 4 stars on Yelp and we decided to try it.  They had a table available if we promised to be finished before their next 7:45 reservation.  No problem for us. I don't know what their regular menu is, but July 14 was all French.  We ordered wine and beer and decided to share a steak frites- think that's what it was called.  (I think sharing was our fatal flaw.) We ordered it \"medium\" as I don't like rare meat.  The service was slow. Slow to get our drinks  and very slow to get our dinner.  The table for 2 to our left had 2 plates of bread along with their meal. We had none. The table of 4 to our right ordered foils gras and other things. They must have been important as the Maitre D fawned over them, brought them complimentary appetizers and returned to chat with them several times while we waited for our dinner.  Finally received our RARE steak frites. The steak was Luke warm and gristly. The fries were piping hot and excellent. Never saw any bread. We felt treated like second class citizens. We won't be back.",

Granted, from what I understand, the menu changes and we may have had an odd night. I spent $14 for a micro plate with a \"mache\" style green (think long stems sticking out of your mouth while savoring a small little leaf) three small bites of an artichoke with about a teaspoon of humus. Flavor was good, for sure. But had to spend $5 for a small roll of artisan bread (I am last person to throw prices out there, but it was almost insulting) to \"sop\" up any remaining nutrients I could find on the plate. Okay. Service was amazing and the drinks were good (the prices are standard with any craft cocktail place in town). Owner is very personable and visible which is great. Three of us each had a drink, one small plate of food and our bill was $96. Hence...the three stars. Fun for tourists to get off of the strip and go to China Town, but I can't see it as a staple for us locals (maybe just me...)",

We ordered several items including the udon, octopus, camp fire duck, lamb neck dumplings, duck salad, clams casino, and the bento box. Everything was amazing! There was nothing that I could complain about. My favorite was the octopus. Hands down the best I've had. It was so flavorful and tender! The campfire duck was also a must try! And the bento box is worth coming back for. There was 5 of us and our bill came out to $350. We all shared and tried each dish. The food was delicious and well worth it. As far as the ambience, it is definitely set up more as a date night type restaurant. I wouldn't really recommend this place for families with small kids. It's more upscale for adults.  I would definitely come back to try other new menu items. Don't underestimate the small menu, the food is amazing.",

When we got the check, it came out to 115 for two people. I'm like; wait that's a bit steep considering we ordered almost all happy hour items. They charged us full price for our drinks and for 2 out of our 4 clams casino. We ordered all those food and drinks within the happy hour time frame though. They did adjust the price of our clams casino but not for our drinks. Our happy hour menu that was handed to us clearly stated $8 specialty cocktails, but the bartender conveniently hands us another happy hour menu that did not have the $8 specialty cocktails in it. Hmm.. weird. I am in no way shape or form intoxicated and I could have sworn the happy hour menu they handed us at first had $8 specialty cocktails on it, but I'm not in an arguing mood today. The food and drinks were good. I would say some of the best cocktails I've had in recent years. The clams casino was phenomenal, although everything else was nothing to write home about (we had $2 tiny grilled oysters, udon, chicken wings, and bread). Would I come back here? Probably not. Servings are tiny for what we're paying for, and I get it.. it's the brain child of a Howard who was at Comme Ca, but come on. You're in Chinatown. I'm Asian; and I can attest that Asian people are cheap.",

We had the bone marrow, uni melt, green apple and beet tartar, foie gras, Chinatown clams casino, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings that we shared as starters.  I savored each bite of each dish.  I had the campfire duck for my main course.  It was cooked to perfection and intensely flavorful.  I savored each bite and was sad (though completely stuffed) when I had finished my meal.  No one had room for desert.  Service was great and prices were very reasonable.  We ate at Le Cirque the night before which was also excellent but we all preferred Sparrow and Wolf.  That is quite impressive considering that Le Cirque has a Michelin Star.  Please give this restaurant a visit -- I doubt you will be disappointed.",

One of the best I've had and my dog definitely loved the left over bone. The place was clean and has a well balanced atmosphere. Besides the amazing food, the service was outstanding! The staff members greated us with warm smiles and consistently checking up on us to make sure we're doing good. I happened to meet John Anthony,  the \"Lead busboy\" according to him, lol (One of the owners) and took his time to speak with us to make sure we're doing good. My gf and I loves him because he was kind and caring, he gladly explained that the bone marrow for my dog is completely safe him and gave us instruction on what to do before I feed the bone to my dog. For everyone that loves fine dining, I highly recommend Sparrow and Wolf.",

She worked he butt off running the front like a pro in spite of her young age. I had the duck which was very good. My daughter had a pork rib eye special that had a great sauce and was tender and delicious. My son had the cheek and marrow dumplings which were good but not my favorite. The people next to us had the big ass pork shank (real name). It looked amazing and they said it was. Fair prices and great food. Good music and nice decor and did I mention the hostess.",

Our waiter was great, the hostess was super friendly and accepted our early arrival with a smile.  The Duck Confit Salad, the Bone Marrow dish with added foie gras, the \"umi bomb\" oysters with sea urchin (special dish last night), German butterball potatoes (how can a potato be this good?!) and last but not least, the Big Ass Pork Shank (milk braised)!! All these dishes were perfectly and uniquely prepared, not to mention delicious cocktails, and great wine.  My only regret was that I don't live in Vegas, so I couldn't have my leftovers boxed up to take home.  To top it all off, their prices are very reasonable for such high end fare.  By far the best meal of our trip.",

    "text": "Such a great spot for a good atmosphere restaurant off of the strip for locals. The design and decor makes this place different from the other culture cuisines that you would find in the Chinatown location. You will see the drastic change in the atmosphere when walking from the parking lot to opening the doors of the restaurant. I didn't have much expectation since I haven't ever really gone to a place with this type of mood in the Chinatown area. It is not comparable to the culture cuisines in that area, also being that the restaurant before Sparrow+Wolf opened use to be a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  This atmosphere is great for any occasion from hanging out with a few friends and having a drink or for a date night. The menu selection is not overwhelming and the libations are also what catches the eye at the tables. The food and plating also caught the eye because it was not far from the looks of the restaurants on the strip! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The oysters were really good along with the lamb.  The service was great and you could tell the servers are genuine. Our server was very attentive and would check up on us in a timely fashion. He would make sure that we would be okay on our drinks and ensured that we had a great dining experience which is great in that the place is still new and gaining customers.",

    "text": "This review is NOT about the food it is in regards to my interraction with John Anthony,  the general manager (GM). I brought 9 of my guests, I'm a Vegas local,  with me with a specific desire to enjoy sweetbreads. This was my first visit and had heard they served them. Upon arrival our group was informed that they were not available. I informed the server that that was the primary motivation of our visit and asked her to speak with the chef to see if any none menu options in the offal department were available. Instead of hearing back from her the GM came to our table. He recounted that sweetbreads weren't available and asked how he could help. I asked my earlier question and asked if there were any none menu options, as I found it unsatisfactory. He said,  \"No.\" I was looking for customer service and was told,  \"I don't know of any restaurant that offers anything other than the menu.\"  Then he suggested that we just leave, ,he didn't care.\"  I told him I had no more questions and he kept going on and on about why he didn't have sweetbreads. I asked him to step away from the table, he ignored that request and illucidated each facet of the menu over a nearly 10 minute period. Essentially he likes his definition of customer service and boiler plate approach. I have had many experiences where off-menu preparations have been proffered at much less,  and more, expensive establishments. A simple,  \"I spoke with the chef and would love to accommodate but we don't really have any options other than the menu. Our sweetbreads are great and we hope you'll come back,  in fact a serving will be on me if you choose to return and hope you enjoy the other item tonight. And thank you for bringing a party of 10 here,  we really appreciate your support.\"",

Inside the place is small but has a very nice modern feel. Open kitchen let's you see what's going on.  Cocktails were well crafted.  We started with Hamachi which was excellent. Well flavored dish.  The Chinatown clams were very nice.  They are topped with sea urchin and have a very fresh flavor.  A bit pricey but good. Grilled octopus was outstanding.  Tender and smoky.  Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings were incredible. Great rich flavor.  Well priced given what you get.  We didn't have the roast chicken special but it looked very nice.  Desert was a roasted pear in a caramelized fruit sauce with ice cream.  Again very good.   Service was excellent. The manager checked on us several times and was happy to re explain dishes.  Waiter was informative and efficient.  Overall an excellent experience.  Add: We have been back three times and love the place.  Try the bento box.  Enough seafood and charcuterie to make a meal for two on its own.",

We are late but we get comped drinks? Sure we'll take it. We both loved tori and Andrew and had a great time talking to them.

The two bartenders were amazing. They were on top of our drinks and waters, this was a huge bonus bc it was over 115 out, and were definitely in sync with one another's style. Great team effort on their part!   Drinks were delicious (the cucumber gin, Model T, one was not my fave but it's not horrible) the slushy on tap is a must try! Along with the carrot ginger one, Lieutenant Dangle.   Artichoke appetizer was fabulous and so was the pork shoulder that just fell apart when you touched it! Oysters were also very delicious!

    "text": "Came for dinner on a Thursday night with a group of friends on a reservation. It was really crowded with a wait at the door for those without reservations. The service was great, with a very attentive waitress who made sure we had enough water and drinks whenever we looked low. They have a drink that comes in a shark glass that I wish I ordered! The food was also great, the dishes we ordered include the Hamachi, Sweetbreads, Udon, Chinatown Clam Casino, and the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings. The most memorable dish for me definitely was the Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings which were delicious and creative. The filling was fantastic and flavorful, and the dumpling skin had the perfect texture. Definitely a great recommendation for friends coming into town looking for a more local eat!",

Two words \"duck\" and \" foie\". Definitely something to remember with this one. Restaurant being in an odd area of this town for one of this caliper definitely stands out on its own. From the design of the restaurant, to the simplistic menu with the ability to try multiple different dishes with flavors for all palettes, Sparrow + Wolf is a must go to. Thanks guys for an awesome after work experience. I will be back soon when I'm the area. Thanks so much.",

    "text": "Shoutouts to Joel, Jackie, Chef Brian (who came out to say hello!) and the entire Sparrow + Wolf team for another awesome dinner! This time around we got the Bento Box, Hamachi, Creekstone Farms Beef Skewer, Where There's Smoke and Model T. Sadly they were not playing hip hop this time around ayyye  The Bento Box comes with 6 oysters, 2 clams, shrimp, tuna tartar, crab, charcuterie, olives/pickled carrots/sweet onion and grilled bread w/lard. Highlights included the clams, shrimp and tuna tartar. I hate comparing restaurants, but the oysters here while fresh and tasty just doesn't offer the same interesting flavors as the oysters at Other Mama (who has better condiments and oysters). Everything else while delicious is nothing special. The grilled bread could either be toastier or softer as tearing it required some effort and wasn't the easiest to bite into, which made the terrines a bit much to eat. The three sauces (a pineapple, mayo, and cocktail condiment) could also use some reworking. The pineapple condiment worked well with the crab but overall they just didn't pack much flavor or work with most of the bento box except the cocktail-ish condiment working on the usual shrimp and oysters. You could find similar in many other French/New American restaurants. There is nothing new or unique or executed better than normal. I like the Bento Box (it's fresh and tasty), but it's unlikely I'll order it again or recommend it for others when there's so many other dishes here to try!  The Hamachi is fun in its presentation. The flavors here complement each other wonderfully and is a nice light dish to start your meal with.  The Beef Skewers... was sold out last time we visited, so we were very, very excited to finally be able to try it this time. The chickpea relish and crepe while tasty couldn't quite save this dish for me. Perhaps I'm not sure how skewers should be had but it was a bit dry and I like my red meats on the rarer, juicier side. The chickpea relish wasn't enough for me to offset that dryness. The meat still has good flavor, but if I were to recommend a heavier, meat dish I would definitely go with the campfire duck instead (which is straight fire!).  We finished this off with a Calamansi Tart, which was absolutely delicious! I usually find tarts too sweet or sour, but this was perfect! The vanilla merengue, blueberry all had a nice slight tang and crunch from the crust. This went by super fast. Enjoyed this dish over the Black Sesame Crepe (where the cherries just had too much of a punch). Would definitely like to see more dessert offerings here.  Not every dish will be a hit, but the freshness of the ingredients used here are undeniable. Everything has a nice clean, rich palette to it.  5 Stars for the very personable and friendly service, but today's dishes would otherwise have been a 4.",

    "text": "I hate to leave a bad review but this is the 2nd time I've been here and am disappointed.  I love food. Any splurge purchase I ever make is food related. I love food so much I am a cook by profession and am engaged to a cook. Hell, I even cook on my days off!  My 2nd job is in customer service. Needless to say I am a good customer. I spent over $300 the last time I visited. Tonight I spent around $200 (tip included). Same server but I'm not sure she recognized us. I am here to say it was not worth the $$$  We were on time for an 8:30 reservation but there was no one up front. Later I realize the hostess was running food.  The oysters were bangin. We got the grilled oysters and the celeriac/wasabi ones. If the meal had stopped here I would have left  completely happy. We ordered the uni melt. It was delicious and super fresh.  Unfortunately the oysters took over 20 min to arrive. After we got our 2nd course (essentially a sandwich) nearly 20 min after, our server finally checked it to ask if we had the oysters yet. If we hadn't that would be pretty terrible that she hadn't checked sooner.  ~20 minutes later, the skate arrived. It sounded glorious on the menu promising \"Alabama white sauce.\" It was dropped off by the hostess who struggled to describe it, calling the grapefruit \"dragonfruit.\"  Her coworker reassured her it was. She came back later to correct herself.  A major turn off- the skate wing comes with all the bones. On first glance it looks like you can just fork into it, but after doing this, we both got mouthfuls of bones. This wouldn't be so unforgiveable if we were told upon ordering or even upon being served  but there was no mention of it. I told the runner that cleared the plates I wish someone would have just told us because we just dug into it and got a mouthful of bones. He apologized but then made the excuse that the staff was still \"acclimating\" to the new menu. I understand this but warning someone of bones in fish is pretty important. As you see in the picture there were MANY bones, and any less cautious eater could choke on them. The grapefruit was actually really good with the sauce, but the skate itself was borderline salty.  At this point we were regretting ordering so much. We devoured everything delivered within 2 minutes of it arriving - we were so hungry. Our server checked in with us (since we probably looked very impatient) and informed us that the trout dish was being plated right now and that it would be 2 more mins. The trout was delivered by the chef/owner himself and he asked us how everything tasted. Of course we said it was good - the food was fine, it was the service that had been terrible.  Until this dish. The trout was simply deboned and butterflied, served with tiny dots of two different sauces, neither of which I could really taste unless I ate them alone (which I did, just to make sure I wasn't imaging things. The green sauce tasted very leafy and the white sauce still tasted like nothing.) That's it. No side or anything that explains why I paid $26 for it.  Finally, our Japanese sweet potato and sweetbreads came in at the same time, shortly after. We wanted to pack up and leave. My fiance was so upset by the trout dish (or lack thereof) I had lost my appetite. The sweet potato (which our server had upsold us because they were out of the brussel sprouts) was totally different than I imagined. It was basically a loaded baked sweet potato. Not worth $12 when I know it had about $2 food cost--being generous. Why had such a dish come out last?  Sweetbreads were okay. They came with a sweet sauce that made me think of bread pudding. The protein was severely underseasoned The veg on the plate was virtually nonexistent.   There is no excuse for this wait. We arrived at 8:30 and left around 10:30. These are small plates and the open kitchen reveals many cooks not moving very fast. The place wasn't even packed and yet I watched as the bar filled up and emptied out before my last course.  Our server was pleasant but really not present other than when trying to sell us more food. I asked for the rest of the food to go and the check. A runner picked up the food nd I told him to pack everything. He didn't take the other half of the potato which we packed ourselves. None of the other things on the sweetbreads dish had been put into the box which is like throwing $10 away. I also watched as our server held a long conversation with a table she obviously knew and watched as a table that got there much later than us got their check before we even got ours. I had to ask for a corrected copy because they charged us for the brussels (which they were out of). My server said \"Oh, they forgot to take that off?\" Who is \"they\"? Aren't you my server and didn't I see you print and hand me the check? I don't know why everyone treated me like I was a stupid child that doesn't know anything about restaurants but I guess it was because I spent so much money here.",

    "text": "The food and atmosphere are great, the 3 is because of our experience. Went for my husbands birthday, we waited 40 mins before a server approached our table (our waters were refilled twice though). The server stated that she was going to turn our experience around after the mistake in communication on their part. We had planned on doing the tasting menu but because we had waited so long before our order was taken weren't going to have time as she stated it was a lengthy service. Super bummed again. The service was fine, nothing above and beyond but we weren't forgotten either. Basically they comped his birthday dessert, which was delicious (honey toast w/huckleberry compote $9). I just felt like a free dessert that was going to be free anyways wasn't turning the experience around. As stated, the food was fantastic . . . that uni melt!!! We did have the hearth baked bread with umami butter and we won't order that again. The runner said the butter was umami dusted, while I realize umami is subtle, it simply looked and tasted like whipped unsalted butter with salt & pepper sprinkled on top. I have recommended other foodies here and will continue as the food wasn't the issue. Insult to injury, the guy at the table next to us as crackin' the entire time! I was going to post a picture but didn't want to be crass or have that in their food pictures here.",

    "text": "My review of a tasting menu we are ordering for an event in a few weeks....  The menu was spectacular tonight.    The chef, Brian Howard, and his business partner, John, are  locals to Vegas.  Chef Howard (he opened chef Thomas Keller's Bouchon restaurant) has worked under several amazing chefs including Micheal Mina, David Myers- and the menus are influenced from classic training from  middle eastern / Mediterranean and French backgrounds.  The primary cooking style Is live fire and his ability to pair items is amazing.  This menu is influenced as modern American bringing as much local produce - tomatoes, vegetables, and \"urban gardening\" together with seasonal influences proteins- sourced as responsible as possible.  Farm to table.    The passed canape's were a little bigger than one bite and they assured me that  this was because they thought I was two (although I eat as two!)   I believe that the best option is to do a French service for the salads. The beets salad was delicious with a surprise crunch of arare at the end and hint of fennel.  The color of the beets and the green apple was so lively, they deserve to be on a white plate and not sure we should force a choice of one salad when two are offered.  I did not try the urban seed green salad <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanseedinc.com%2F&s=a892e4ec3ef0ea8ef4b55ef6989fa5a8d6f705de916da4fb6202ff42e0783045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">urbanseedinc.com</a> but would have loved it!  The vegetable tart was again beautiful.  With the caper sauce it filled the plate and had a LARGE assortment of Vegetables. I particularly like the variety of morel and left foot mushrooms which were very filling. I did ask that they cut the green onions, I found them a little difficult to cut because they were cooked.  I believe the reason I was here was really to check out the short rib and halibut dinner. That was definitely the highlight of the evening. The short rib had a sticky thai glaze on it which made it a little sweet, but they offset that with a very tiny green pepper which gave it a pop.  It was cut into three sections so it was very easy to eat. The halibut was a perfect portion of about 3 ounces and it was very flaky. I understand that halibut is really in season and it's freshest point Within the next five weeks so we are right in its wheel house. The plate was   Presented in a way that the food was the star. It was very simple presentation, with very little sauces. I was not prepared for all of the flavors in the meal and  they definitely surprised me.  I took the opportunity while I was there to speak to the guests at the table next to me :)They were talking about the short ribs, as a matter of fact, and said that this was the reason that they were there. The restaurant was completely full by the time I am leaving. It's definitely a neighbor restaurant that is drying a very large crowd because of the chef.    I might have cheated and eaten some of the potato but it was just too good looking not too!    The desserts were all beautiful. Lemon is my favorite anything and I understand you guys are going to have that served with a chef preparation at a station. If so that'll be beautiful for your guests on a gorgeous evening.",

Needless to say, I was underdressed for this place (I was the only person in Lululemon and Nikes) full of hipsters, beards and tattoos. I seemed lost and confused...the crowd seemed like they should be in Downtown Las Vegas but they're in Chinatown.  What was even confusing to me was the beautifully-plated food that belongs on The Strip. Chef Brian Howard brought his A-game to Chinatown in a rather unassuming stripmall. The interior is small and modern. The food was complex but has familiar flavors. You can taste Asian, Indian/ Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean influences.  The menu is simple with less than 20 items to choose from - you want a small menu so, the kitchen can focus on perfecting the dishes they have. And believe me, the items I tried did not disappoint. All delicious and beautiful.  Hamachi: Thin slices of Hamachi on fish-cracker/pork rind with citrus and lychee, miso schmaltz, scallion, and buckwheat. Great textures and flavors with a fine balance. 5/5  Artichoke: Crunchy exterior with a soft and almost creamy artichoke center on a bed of charred tomatillo, herbs, hummus...sprinkled with pine nuts and arugula. This has Mediterranean + Middle Eastern flavors to it. 5/5  Chinatown Clams Casino: I'm not fond of clams but I gave it a try anyway. This has shiitake mushrooms, lap cheong, and uni hollandaise. It has a rich and creamy feel to it. 5/5  Beef and Cheek Bone Marrow Dumpling: Dumplings with green onion emulsion. The least appealing dish of the evening (see picture). But appearance aside, these dumplings taste good. I liked the pepperiness of this dish to balance the richness of the beef cheek and bone marrow. The dumplings were cooked al dente so they have a nice bite 4/5  Pork Shoulder: A patty made with pork shoulder with crushed peanuts and a schmear of black garlic on the side. This has Chinese and Thai flavors to it. The pork was tender with a hint of ginger. 5/5  Beef Skewer: Tender and flavorful pieces of grilled beef with a side of sweet and sour chickpea relish, and Vadouvan crepe + smoked tallow butter. You get Indian + Middle Eastern flavors. Use the crepe to scoop up the relish and juices (like you would with injera). 5/5  Calamansi Tart: Calamansi is a small citrus fruit from Southeast Asia - mainly the Philippines. I'm not a big fan of citrusy desserts but this I liked a lot. Calamansi can be overly tart but if done right, it's superb! Creamy calamansi custard topped with torched marshmallow on a crisp tart. 5/5  The service was excellent. The food came out at a reasonable pace. We got to meet Chef Brian. It was an overall delightful experience.",

Wish I brought more friends so that I could have tried more dishes but the 4 dishes we got were amazing- taste, flavor and presentation.  We started with the Chinatown Casino Clam- was one of my favorite- eat it slow or fast- the flavors were unbelievable.  We loved the Campfire Duck with Foie gras- melts on your mouth.  We also enjoyed the sweetbread- first time trying it; and the beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling.   We ended dinner with calamansi tart- so perfect.   Definite will come back.",

    "text": "I had such high hopes for this restaurant base on the great reviews! But I was left disappointed.   The decor was decent but nothing overly wow about it. We ask for a 6:45 pm at 6:30 pm and had no issues at all so we were off to a great start. We ordered the popular items: clam casino, duck with foie Gras, and beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling. All 3 items would normally have me drooling for more but the description was way fancier than what we got.   Clam casino - I didn't taste any Chinese sausage at all. And the uni was an after thought. It felt like it was placed on the clams just to get instagram pics. Don't get me wrong, I love uni! But the dish didn't need the uni at all. Although the clams were tasty, I thought the dish was trying too hard.   Beef cheek & bone marrow dumplings - My Uber driver warned me that these dumplings were too salty and boy was he on point. Dumplings were salty and soggy. It didn't taste like beef cheek or bone marrow. If anything, they tasted like plain salted shredded beef dumplings that were left in a pile of foam. Nothing spectacular at all.   Duck with foie Gras - Maybe the chef had an off night but my duck was extra chewy. And the foie Gras tasted a little burnt. Overall not impressed!   To summarize, pricey lackluster food. People seem to come here for their cocktails too but we didn't get a chance to try. I doubt I'll return.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place. I really did. There were some bright spots but overall it wasn't that great.   Instead of a 3-star review for being standard or ordinary. They had some good dishes and some that were horrible.   First of all the service was wonderful. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The owner/manager was chatty without overdoing it. The restaurant is fairly tightly packed and the vibe at the tables near ours was good. We chimed in on each other's conversations a couple of times which I always think is fun when the mood is right.   So the good stuff were the cocktails. Yum! The wine list was reasonable and offered a bit of everything. We had a scallop special where they were served oyster style - with dressing on the half shell.   We ordered a half dozen oysters that were not a great choice. The oysters were fresh...the problem was that the ones we got with shiitake lap cheong vinaigrette were so so salty. Then the simply raw oysters came with nothing at all which we weren't prepared for- usually I expect horseradish or vinegar. The very least they could do would be serve with a lemon wedge. Nothing.   My husband got the better choices he had campfire duck and a chocolate dessert. Almost faultless but the duck was a little salty. Folks at the table next to ours liked their duck too.   On to my dishes. I love lamb dishes but the roasted lamb neck was truly awful and inedible. The seasoning on it was good but when i took my first bite I got a huge mouthful of fat with it. So off putting. When I carved farther into the roast lamb I cut off huge globs of fat. I've never been served anything like it before. There was so much fat, more than there was meat. I couldn't eat it. Was it not cooked long enough and fat was supposed to render and drip off during cooking? That would make sense but the way it was served was just wrong. Our waiter was very good about it and took it away. I had the Thai lime creme brulee. Another mistake. Again the flavors were there but the top of the brulee wasn't fired at all. No sugary crispy top means it's not a brulee. And the custard although tasty flavors was grainy. So 2 dishes we couldn't eat.   It's a modern cool room with great drinks and staff but I can't get past the poor food. (Or poor execution of good ideas)",

My only complaint was the wrapper was thick and chewy. We followed that up with the roasted bone marrow, the hot potato, broccolini and lamb bolognese lasagna. All were outstanding. Our least favorite was the lasagna because the lamb was, perhaps, a little too subtle. Our favorite was the hot potato, just edging out the broccolini and bone marrow. The bread was excellent  The server was knowledgeable and attentive. Food delivery was erratic, with long gaps between some dishes, our only real complaint. The surroundings were modern and comfortable.   We'll go back.",

They had fowl on the menu, yes. Does this mean I was to be the wolf? The decor is lacking; it's all in the plates, which I will take a dining set for 8, please, the one with the rabbits.   App: best tuna salad I wish I could make at home called Hamachi. It has lychee, my buzz fruit.   The lamb bolognese called \"Udon\" is rich, savory, and just the right proportion. We followed with the pork shoulder. Kudos on that, chef. The perfect combo of succulent pig and pickled something. It was crunchy, gave that zingy bite.   For cocktails we had Jump the Shark (served in a shark head) and my drink of choice, a pork fat mezcal infused and pineapple Where there's smoke, it's on my tastebuds.   Overall nice experience for a new spot NOT on the strip. I do believe they are transplants from Cali but have nothing to back it up. Just a vibe with chic wait staff.",

Some of the dishes here are like nothing I have ever had before and I live in New York City where I am surrounded by excellent food. Chef Brian is a genius and John, one of the owners, was the most gracious host taking time to speak to each and every table. The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive. This place was so good I came back a second night in a row (something I typically never do because I always like to try new places).   Dishes consumed:  1. Clams Casino - Grew up eating stuffed clams my whole life and I can say with 100% certainty, no clam will ever measure up to theirs. 2. Duck Confit and Sweet Potato Dumpling - So good I would have licked the plate clean if not taken away when I wasn't looking.  3. Braised Lamb Neck - I don't eat lamb but I was willing to try it given how good everything else was and I was not disappointed. Fall off the bone delicious.  4. Pavlova for dessert - Think lemon meringue meets key lime pie in the most elegant way possible. Very light and a nice palate cleanser after a rich meal.   Night 2 1. Dry aged porterhouse - Excellent flavor that made it different from the steakhouses I have been to (Peter Lugar, Smith & Wollensky etc.). Came with 8 or so side dishes such as eggplant, cabbage, potatoes, mushrooms and sauces that were all delightful.  2. Gnocchi Special - I am Italian and I eat gnocchi all the time including several times in Italy. This is in my top three Gnocchi dishes I have ever had. So soft you don't even need teeth and the asian/sichuan flavor was insane.  3. Pavlova again.   If I could give it more than 5 stars i would!",

    "text": "We went for my birthday - the vibe is very nice, very trendy and fanciful. Wait staff was great.  Menu took us a bit to figure out - one of those where the descriptions are so fancy, it takes you a second to figure out what you're even reading. But not a problem at all. Love that they do everything family-style, because we love to taste everything.  Started with oysters - loved the preparation and presentation. But these were truly bad oysters - I guess they just weren't fresh. The oyster itself tasted very salty and strong, like a mouthful of dirty sea water. That's ok, I thought, because oysters are tricky, I won't rule them out just on that account. Living on the gulf I've had a lot of oysters of differing quality.  We got the dumplings and a salad. Both were fine, but not amazing. We got the beef and bone marrow. Again it was fine,  just not anything special. Presentation on all items was terrific though.  Finally the lasagne and halibut came out. These were great! Halibut tasted fresh and very subtle, delightful. The lasagne was a new spin on the classic dish that took it to the next level.  But all in all, more than half our dishes were either mediocre or actually pretty bad, and for the price tag, you're really looking for every item to be good or great. Hence my rating, although I enjoyed the experience overall and wish them luck.",

I came here late afternoon to have a quick bite and starred at their menu for a long time because everything sound good. Thankfully the bartender helped me and recommended what to get. He first surprised me with a special cocktail thats not on the menu, i believe it was a mojito.   I was suggested to order the Campfire Duck Breast. Its my first time ever having Duck breast and I gave it a 5/5. The way the duck just melts in your mouth and the portion is perfect. I first got the uni melt, it was super good too. Fresh uni i ever tried. This place will last for a very long time with their creative and exquisite dishes. Will definitely bring my brother around here and friends.",

Let's start with service...superb, our server was attentive, knowledgeable and polite.  John Anthony, a partner in the venture, was our sommelier for the night painstakingly explaining his choices for the pairings and fully explaining the dishes.  This is what I love in this kind of dining.  Every dish was expertly played from the swordfish ceviche to the braised lamb neck that was done over a 3 day period.  Get the Viking scallops flown in fresh, in the shell, from NJ and prepared on site.  If you like duck they have a duck and sweet potato dumpling...go for it  We will be back and perfect for us we are locals",

I will say, not your traditional menu, you must be adventurous and trust the chefs, flavors you think sound crazy or wouldn't work actually does.    To start off, I ordered the \"Wisdom of the Spud\" and my sister had the \"Scotty doesn't know\".  Both drinks were delicious and you can tell there was lots of love and effort put into it.    For our sharing plates we had: Hamachi carpaccio-do not miss this dish, soo good and so many flavors that worked so well together. Ocean parfait- sounds strange but nice and refreshing, very different Duck confit potato dumpling- the most filling of all the dishes, if you're starving order this one, good but filling I take another bite. And scallop robata- good but spicy,  could've done without this one   I wish we had space for dessert, will probably have to make another trip for this.  Service was great, menu was explained with great detail and other servers had great recommendations.",

    "text": "Although Sparrow + Wolf is located in Chinatown, the menu is decidedly upscale American. My husband and I stopped in during Restaurant Week, and that timing saved us a boatload of cash; our $50 seven-dish meal would be triple that price normally. (The lamb neck alone is listed as $44.)   What a bargain, and what a meal! Each dish was served family style, and the portions were plentiful. After a huge bowl of roasted romanesco and sugar snap peas, we were served my favorite two items of the night: steak tartare and swordfish aguachile. The tartare was the best I have ever eaten! Flecked with shitake mushrooms and topped with a soft-boiled egg, the meat was great by itself but even better when paired with the crusty bread it was served upon. The swordfish was equally flavorful, and its brightness contrasted well with the earthiness of the previous dish.  These two raw dishes were the standouts for me, but my husband couldn't get enough of the lamb neck, which was braised all day in milk. I loved the flavor as well, but I'm not a fan of that texture, so even though I know quality when I taste it, I didn't eat much. (Luckily for him, who got to eat it all!) We both enjoyed the grilled scallops, which were cooked perfectly, and the brown sugar cake was a nice ending to a fabulous meal.  Although plenty of diners around us were imbibing some interesting-looking cocktails, we stuck with wine: sauvignon blanc to start and pinot noir for the entrees. There is a well-balanced wine list with a varying price range, so it's easy to find something tasty to accompany your meal.  It may be a bit pricey, but this neighborhood eatery has all the quality of a high-end Strip restaurant with less hassle. (And, oh, that tartare!)",

Yet the staff made it their priority to make sure I had a great meal with my restrictions in mind. The chef Anthony came out personally to talk with me and then made not one but three special dishes for me. All the staff was friendly, non judgmental about my difficult dietary needs and were so helpful. Food was amazing too!",

    "text": "Cool fusion restaurant with a large selection of drinks. Came here with my family on a Vegas trip, though we were probably only the few large groups that were there. I would say this place is more of a bar setting for a small group of friends. The portions are relatively small, as they're more like appetizers, but very shareable.   1. Ocean Parfait: Unless you're a super fan of quirky dishes and uni, I would not recommend paying $14 for a cup of foam...  2. Steak Tartare: Probably my favorite dish! Though I've never had tartare before, this is definitely one of the more worthwhile dishes on their menu. The crispy pieces of bread sprinkled with cheese paired really well with the tartare and egg yolk. Great dish to share.  3. Oysters (simply raw, kizami wasabi butter, and grilled with miso): Another one of my favorites. These oysters tasted fresh and the different flavors were definitely a plus. The wasabi was not too spicy at all, so don't be afraid to try it. Sadly, they ran out of oysters after the first plate, but the waiter graciously asked the chef to make us a shrimp cocktail platter not on the menu. What A+ service!  4. Lamb Bolognese Miso Lasagna and Garlic Bread: This dish looked beautiful, but the taste didn't strike me as anything super special, considering the ingredients and price ($26). However, if you're craving lasagna in general, this will not disappoint.  5. Bone Marrow: Beautiful presentation, but I believe the chili masked the taste of the actual bone marrow. It was my first time trying bone marrow and, sadly, I couldn't really tell what was chili and what was bone marrow. I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt as my brother really enjoyed his portion.  6. Lamb neck: One of the priciest dishes on the menu, but the portion here is also one of the largest. The lamb meat was very tender and juicy (with plenty of fat to go around if that's your thing).   7. Scallion pancakes: I'm not sure where these were on the menu, but they tasted like any scallion pancake from a Chinese restaurant.  8. Ice cream sandwich: A pretty descent dessert for $9! The almond cookie had the texture of a macaron and the candied ginger added a nice zesty flavor.   9. We also had the scallops and swordfish, which may be on their new menu. Unfortunately, I didn't take pictures of them, but the two dishes were amongst the tastier ones and, of course, presented beautifully. Scallops were soft and juicy. Swordfish was prepared like a salsa and came with some really unique and tasty chips--they seemed to melt in your mouth like popcorn does.  Overall, I'd give the food a solid 4 stars, but I would take away half a star, considering the price, and a couple of confusing dishes. However, giving three stars would be too harsh! Maybe I psyched myself up too much with the other reviews, but some dishes did not come through like I expected (bone marrow, lasagna, and ocean parfait). However, if you order right, I think you can make your dinner more worthwhile.  Tip: you can't go wrong with the beef tartare or oysters! You can also check in for a free glass of wine, which is awesome. The service was also impeccable :)",

S&W has been on my radar for a while now and I've just not had a good enuf reason to get here.  So... when the Anniversary rolled around, the hubby and I decided we NEEDED to go here and to make it happen. So, we did. So, there!  And it was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb.com</a>!  Service was Spectacular!  Everyone was genuinely nice and friendly without being sugary-sweet friendly.    Started with a French 75-ish type cocktail to get the juices flowing.  We continued with cocktails thru the first dish and then switched it up to wine later.  We ordered a number of shared plates: Romanesco - this is a salad. Fresh, Bright flavors.  Really a nice starter because it has a little acidity to it in the dressing to get you salivating. Hamachi Carpaccio - We are fans of sushi so we thought we would enjoy this. Of everything we tasted, this was our least favorite.  I think it was a texture thing.  The fish seemed too soft/mushy and didn't seem to have much flavor.  Not compared to the other dishes that is. Steak Tartare - Wow!  This was Great.  Meaty and they didn't try to hide the meat flavor with a bunch of onion or garlic some other places do.  The toasty bread it came with had just the right ratio of soft to crunch. Duck Dumpling - Yes, Please!  This and a bubbly wine... I'm Good!  So Savory!  I think this has ruined me for future dumplings. Lamb Neck - Stop The Presses!  This was a Scrumptious Surprise!  So Freakin' Good!  It's meaty, it's fatty, it's savory, it's delectable, it's downright sinful.  If you are a meat eater and love trying something different... Go For This!  I'd go back just for this dish alone with a nice glass of red wine.    This was our Anniversary dinner so we splurged on drinks and food.  I was too full to go for a dessert so we opted to end on a high note with that lamb.  Oh Man.... That. Lamb.  (smiling and sighing)  With that said, our total before tip was $210.  Almost half of this was booze.  So, if you don't drink, it's more reasonable.  Not a cheap date, but not anywhere near our highest Anniversary bill.  I'd totally go back here for a Not-Our-Anniversary-Date-Night.  We won't drink as much next time. ha!",

SO DELICIOUS! It's spicier than I thought but definitely the good kind! Must order!   We also ordered the mushroom, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and the duck. Must order the duck!!!   I loved Tea Thyme cocktail, but I had a friend who thought it tasted like medicine lol.   The parking lot seemed convenient to park, although we Lyft'ed to the restaurant. I highly recommended this place and will definitely come back again.",

Our favorites were the Romanesco...couldn't stop eating this, and the Duck Confit and Sweet Potato dumplings...sauce was to die for.   Yelp checkin offer was fantastic and the wine we picked was so good we almost had a whole bottle.   Service was a little bit off the night we went. Probably just getting into the grove since we were there really early.   We got reservations through Opentable. So easy! Overall great food and experience. Would certainly go back.",

We came as a group and tried their cheese and charcuterie board, hamachi carpaccio, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, hearth baked bread, uni melt, wood roasted bone marrow, sambal chile & brioche crusted grouper, and campfire duck. My favorites had to be the campfire duck, grouper, and the dumplings.   YOU CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT PASS UP THE CAMPFIRE DUCK.   Oh and use the bread to mop up the leftover dumpling sauce.   Aside from the food, I can't get over the service at this place. They are the friendliest bunch and catered to our different needs. Definitely try it when you're around the area, but just don't come when you are super hungry. Remember, small plates. So unless you won a lot from the slot machines, come when you have a reasonable appetite.",

Steak tartare which has raw yolk taste special than other restaurant, my foodie friend gave this comment.  Foie gros is off menu, it is toothsome, highly recommend this. Hamachi is well done but very tasty, I like their seasoning very well. Definitely will come back if I am here again.",

Restaurant is not that busy on a Thursday.  Host is finally seen talking to some patrons leaving.  He stops them for a conversation right next to us about, \"I've known the chef for a decade. He does things the French way -- everyone is yes chef no chef no matter who they are.  He knows Thomas Keller.\"  All trite, porous, grandstanding after having waited for him to show up.   We are shown to a table and ok! Do not care about all that let's just have the food.  Waitress has us wait another 8-10 mins as we have water filled.  She says I'll be right back and after 5 more minutes I'm ready to leave. I really wanted to go here.  I love fine American when it is well executed and the menu was something that intrigued me.  But the hipster couple struggling with some blown up chicharron and the lack of any service had me defeated. As I'm leaving I decide to tell the host who looked like an overweight Brian from Office Space with all the flair, that we're leaving we have waited too long.  He spins around and I tell him we waited 10 mins in the lobby and 15 mins at the table and didn't get served.  He replies \"it was not more than 5 minutes at front\".  Uhh ok maybe closer to 5 minutes of nobody greeting us on a slow Thursday: great point.  Then proceeds to say, \"you were angry when you came in here, you were never going to be happy.\" Then pirouettes around and walks away from me. Wow.  I work customer service and I would be seriously reprimanded for saying this to someone.  Maybe they are dancing upon the hubris of their success over there, but bad service while bite you back in the end.  I really hope this guy gets a talking to because you are never supposed to be rude like that to the customer.  And I was not even being rude!  Just saying we were leaving because we waited too long.  We went to another restaurant nearby and had great food with good service.  Don't be abused by the staff because they think they are chic.",

I was intrigue by their menu at first due to the foie gras duck (campfire duck) and clam w/uni (instead of the boring oysters and uni, which is always a win win). First off, we got the bar seat and John Anthony (Manager) give us the special: Hamachi Kama & Bone marrow w/escargot. Alright I have both of those in different variations, but let me TELL you! Their take on it is amazing. Hamachi is medium rare w/the balance of the pear and watermelon daikon salad is amazing. That's just their special m. We orders the clams w/uni, big ass pork loins and the camp fire duck  (I tried to convince John to call it Duck Duck Goose lol). It's like a porno experiment in my mouth . Everything was on point m-if I have to pick the least favorite dish (and that's a big IF, it's a bone marrow- can you believe it? The bone marrow w/escargot!! But yes, it was that good. Not to mention all their drinks was so innovative and amazing. Based on the quality of the food, innovative of the menu and not to mention t he reasonably priced menu-this place truly deserve a 5 stars-I wish them luck in their venture.",

    "text": "I went for Happy Hour.  Though the options were limited on the Happy Hour menu,  I did try the Argentinian shrimp ($5 off) but went with beef tartare from the main menu as well.  I also ordered a few half price draft beers (originally $8; though only 4 options so very limited selection).  Wine and cocktails were unfortunately not affected by Happy Hour either.  And Happy Hour is strictly limited to the bar only as well (5:00-6:30).  I ordered their house old fashioned which was fantastic and strong.  I also got the Spring Mountain sour which was a little too experimental and tasted too much like beets for my liking but interesting nonetheless.  As only an drink and bounce, that's fine, but combined with food, it was a bit overpowering.  The shrimp were huge and tasty but not much going on in terms of outstanding taste.  However the tartare was fantastic; some of the best I've had.  And the bread had some Indian spices on it which were truly complimentary to the tartare.  Overall the meal was very nice and Sparrow and Wolf would be perfect for a dinner out off the strip.  It's very nice to see successful chefs in the area venturing off and creating their own small menu to call their own.  A big peeve I found was that the online menu clearly had not been updated, so one of the cocktails I wanted and the lamb tartare were no longer available.  Honestly, for the quality, the price of $60 for my meal was pretty good.  Either way, Sparrow and Wolf is very good; hopefully they open for lunch or brunch in the future.",

I couldn't stop admiring the beautiful long wooden dining table that I kept wishing could be mine.  The service was phenomenal and attentive.  Everything on the menu was explained to us and you could tell how the whole staff was so passionate about it.  We started with the Bento box that included a selection of Argentinian shrimps, clams, oysters, crab meat, lamb tar tar, and a variety of charcuterie meats.  I enjoyed the freshness of the seafood and the creative sauces on the oysters.  We also shared the homemade bread, fried artichoke, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings (my favorite), farmed eggs (2nd favorite, so simple yet elegantly put together), beef skewers, and the campfire duck with foie gras).  I was so satisfied with my meal.  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu, but got to make it soon as I was told the menu will always be updating with new creations.  What a surprising gem in the heart of Chinatown!",

I found out days later that I was charged $300 for a cancelation fee. I attempted to call the management to possibly resolve the issue. I spoke with the GM John Anthony. He said that he would speak to the chef and the owner to see what can be done due to the circumstances. John said that he would call back the next day. Never received another phone call from management. Multiple attempts made to contact John Anthony to try and resolve the issue. Multiple voicemails and texts sent without response. Very unfortunate situation that management could not be professional about the situation. I unfortunately will not be returning back to the restaurant because of this. Very sad.",

I don't understand how I'm eating foie gras and caviar, but I am being reminded of my childhood. When I eat his food it feels like falling in love. I would give five stars (more if possible) but every single time I eat here my server has been RUDE AS HELL. Maybe because I am a young woman dining alone I give the impression of not belonging in this restaurant, but I have a passion for great food AND great service. I always tip 25% minimum (even when my server is bitchy), usually much more. I would come by more often if I didn't feel bullied by my waitress.",

He and the other service staff (and even the owner) made sure our plates cleared quickly and that we had fresh plates and silverware for each course.  The owner also made sure we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal.   This was very much appreciated and such a nice touch.

Our server spent a significant time to explain detail about menu and their specials. Now is why I knocked off 1 star, we were sat at a table next to the bar end. It wasn't a busy night, they had only 5 tables at around 7pm, the bar had many seats left in the middle. But somehow, they seated another couple right next to, turned their back to us. So the girl's b*tt only couple feet from my wife face since the bar stool was must higher than our table. My wife felt very uncomfortable for the entire meal since the girl kept fixing her dress.

Items served were:  Charcuterie platter with lardo and culatello ham Lamb tartare with bhatura bread Hearth baked bread Artichoke with white bean hummus, charred tomatillo, mortared herbs, pine nuts & arugula Butcher wings Beef skewer Black truffle meatballs with bonito flakes Chinatown clams on the half shell Duck breast with foie gras Lamb ragu with udon noodles Beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings Sweetbreads with grilled romaine hearts, smoked bacon, English peas & fond blanc Tres Leches--vanilla bean, orange and cocoa nib crunch Calamansi tart with vanilla meringue and blueberries Black sesame crepe with cherry yuzu, marmalade, and whipped cream  With the selection we opted for, there was something for everyone.  The charcuterie platter was nicely done with the N'duja being tops in flavor.  The lamb tartare was very good with the apple and walnuts, as were the black truffle meatballs topped with bonito flakes.  Another favorite of mine was the duck breast with foie gras.  The beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings need work.  The dumpling was very chewy.   Of the desserts we tried, the Calamansi tart and the tres leches were my picks.  The tart was excellent and the tart was a good sized dish meant for sharing.  Service was very good and the music was at a level that allowed conversation while still being able to hear the music.  Later as more people arrived, the sound in the restaurant picked up but it was never loud.  It's a little pricey for the size of the servings but the quality of the food, the preparation, and the presentation make it worth it.",

    "text": "Such a great dinner experience the three times  that I've gone. The service is a little off, but I think that with time hopefully the bumps smooth out.  You could definitely order just order apps, share those, and get comfortably full without having ordered a main dish (although we did). The octopus & yellowtail tartare were the stars of the show and I ordered them the second time I came. The scallops with pancetta bits were amazing, and I'm glad we got them despite being on the full side.   The duck does come prepared medium rare, so I would let your server know if you're not comfortable with it being that pink. The grilled lobster dumplings were out of this world!! Their menu does change quite often so don't fall too in love with a dish as it probably won't be there when you return lol.   The dessert wasn't anything mind blowing and the second time around I skipped it but the plates that it comes out on ARE SO CUTE.   Overall I'm really happy each time I come and definitely add this to my go-to indulgent spots!",

I would prefer the call these bartenders mixologists due to their extensive knowledge in beverage including spirits, extracts, aromatics...   Luckily we came in toward the end of the night we so got a lot of one on one time with the most awesome bartender Terry Clark, and another amazing female bartender with Tattoo sleeves (sorry I didn't get your name!).   They were both whipping up random concoctions to test and they will custom design a drink to your preferences.  This is the type of bar I would want to be on a first name basis with all the mixologists. It's a very inviting space and the smell of bacon is intoxicating!   I will definitely be back to try the food and hang out at the bar!  Cocktails are roughly $14.",

Smart modern chic that gives the vibe of casual and fun yet effortless sophistication. Aka you can bring your hot date to this restaurant or just stop by in your casual attire and not feel out of place because this place is just so cool.   Service: five stars. We sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive; both the bar staff and the general crew. When they brought us our food, they explained the dishes in details. I really liked that because it built up the anticipations!   Food: five stars. Half a dozen fresh oysters with three different toppings: lemon jelly, pineapple flavored something and a mint something. They were all good but my personal favorite was the mint.  Artichoke salad: so delicious with the hearts of artichoke as the bed with flowers and deep fried leaves and fresh vegetables on top.  Pork shoulder - stuffed in some sort of casing and garnished with the yellow dikon pickle and black garlic paste. It was a good dish but I thought the shoulder meat could be more tender and flavorful.  Last but most definitely not least and my absolute personal favorite: the duck. Slices of perfectly seared, medium rare duck topped with a generous piece of foie gras. The perfect combination of the duck and the foie gras in each bite was orgasmic.  I purposefully chose a glass of the Troublemaker from Paso Robles just for this dish and it was heaven.   I am so in love with every aspect of S&W. The people that work there are super friendly and good at their jobs. We even met the manager, John, and he was so much fun and kind. He made us felt so welcome and like we were frequent patrons, which we will now become.   I cannot wait to return and try other dishes because I know I will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Ooooh!  That \"+\" sign is just so HOT right now!!  And to think this was a shitty pho joint just a few months ago to a now beautiful, modern dining room executing some very creative food and drink (my first libation arrived in a large cup shaped like a shark) off the strip is awesome.  I was a big fan of Chef Brian Howard's Comme Ca (RIP...sniff, sniff) at Cosmopolitan, so my expectations were pretty high and everything we tried totally delivered.    The \"Campfire Duck\" had me written all over it.  The duck breast, cooked a lovely medium rare with a delectable piece of foie gras on top, wood eared mushroom, salted cucumber, plum and rich duck bone broth was so ridiculously good that I plan on writing a letter to Santa for a box of this.  Do not share.  Think selfishly.  Be an asshole if you have to.    I could handle being a vegetarian if I had their \"Artichoke\" every single day.  Featuring white bean hummus, charred tomatillo, mortared herbs, pine nuts and arugula, it was presented wonderfully and every bite was a great mix of char, light citrus, and earth.  Another big hit at the table was the \"Udon\" with its lamb bolognese topped with a sous vide egg.  If there was any downside at all, it was portion size.  Our party of 4 was still a bit hungry after 6 dishes and 2 desserts, which may just be our fault.  But if the duck is $21, why not just make it $30 for a larger sized plate?  I am positive that I'd shell out even more for a full breast (sounds dirty?) and feel confident I wouldn't be the only one.  If these plates were truly meant to be shared, 3 slices of meat to a serving just leads to a stare down for the last piece.  Who wants to get stabbed with a dinner knife on a hot date?  Not I!  So my advice would be to over order by a couple of dishes or perhaps start with some wine and their charcuterie board.   That's all minor stuff in the grand scheme.  This place is outstanding and I look forward to repeat visits!",

This second visit was a small late night meal post show at the Smith Center. Perhaps it was the late hour, but two (asparagus and hot potato pave) out of four dishes were served lukewarm. The potato pave was especially disappointing as it was over cooked and dried out. I suspect it had been made earlier in the day and then warmed up. I did mention it being disappointing to the server, but she didn't offer to do anything about it. Given how expensive the food is, we probably won't be going back. There are a lot of other restaurants in this town which are more consistent in quality at this high price point.",

    "text": "Was super excited to come in to try this place. Our expectations were pretty high having dined and loving Comme Ca. Interior and atmosphere was very nice smelled of wood fire which was lovely. Only complaint would be that the tables were super close together which made a bit of a tight squeeze getting in and out. Another down side was the arguing couple right next to us who was almost elbow to elbow. It felt like the crazy lady was kinda yelling at me bc of how close they were. It was even harder to look away bc I could see her frowny face from the corner of my eye without even trying   * Get Off The Lawn was very strong. Served with an orange peel and a very very small beef jerky that is supposed to be eaten while you drink ..gonna need a much bigger piece of jerky to go with that drink tho lol  * Model T - was good. Cucumber was very refreshing   * Beef Cheek & Marrow Dumplings - We ordered this to start when we ordered our drinks but it never came out bummer bc I really wanted to try this. (We probably sat at our table foodless for at least 30 mins)   * Duck & Foie Gras - Amazeballs!! This was the first food item to come out to our table. Comes with 3 slices of duck breast over wood ear mushrooms topped with a good piece of foie gras in a savory sauce.  * Butcher Wings - sold by per wing. Really liked the wood fired char taste to it. Very moist as a wing should be.   * Argentinean Red Shrimp - Served with 3 shrimps with heads on a plate. Really enjoyed the sauce it came in   * Beef Carpaccio - Good   * Sweetbreads - Good. Haven't had good sweetbreads since Rosemarys was still open. Loved everything about this dish from the sweetbreads to grilled baby romaine wrapped with bacon to the sweet english peas and pea shoots   Tres Leches - kinda torn on this one. Served with the cake on the bottom and a chocolate Hennessy moose on top with chocolate tuilles. I'm a Hennessy shot drinker myself but the amount of cognac in the moose made the flavor too strong to enjoy. If you love the strong taste of cognac then you will like this cake more than I did.  Overall the food is good. The portions are on the smaller size but you are paying the higher price for the better quality. After being open for 1 month the service could be better. Our server was nice but she did not check back on us often. After she took our drink order and failed to put in our dumpling order she never came back to take our food order. We had to wave her down after we finished our drinks to take our food order then had to ask another server for a dessert menu. We will be back to try the other yummy items on the menu. Still want to try the dumplings we missed. Heard the happy hour is coming soon definitely can't wait for that one",

    "text": "It was our first night in town.  The wife and I had made it point to dine off-Strip as much as possible to experience some of the great spots that only the locals know about.  As a result, we made our way off-Strip for dinner on a Thursday night at SPARROW + WOLF.  The chef, Brian Howard, was the chef at Comme Ca, a place that we had really enjoyed when it was open at the Cosmo.  We arrived around 6PM.  We were greeted with a smile by the hostess as we walked in the door.  The dining room was fairly empty, but we requested to sit at the bar.       Sparrow + Wolf's cuisine was eclectic American but with seeming Japanese influences.  While we looked over the menu, I started off with a We Can Prevent Forest Fires ($14) made with Dalmore 12-year old Scotch, Cynar, Vida Del Maguel Mezcal, lemon, pine simple syrup, and garnished with a flamed rosemary sprig.  It was a delicious mix of boozy, bitter, goodness with a pronounced, but balanced smokey note.  Although the standard menu looked great, we decided on the Chef's Tasting Menu ($125/person) with beverage pairings ($45/person).  Since there wasn't a printed tasting menu, it's likely safe to say that it changes frequently, if not daily.  Most, if not all, of dishes that we received didn't appear to come off of the regular menu.  Every dish that we received seemed to be made fresh to order, incorporating high quality ingredients, and beautifully presented.  We found every course enormously satisfying.  The beverage pairings were spot on with the food and generous.  Service throughout was friendly and attentive, making us tourists feel like local regulars.  Sparrow + Wolf was an excellent start to our week of dining in Las Vegas.  Locals have probably already gotten the word on this place, but I'd highly recommend it for those adventurous (i.e. willing to leave the Strip) out-of-towners looking for an amazing food easily accessible from/to the Strip by Uber or Lyft.",

    "text": "An incredibly crafted American cuisine off the strip in Chinatown  I've been to this location several times in its former business and never has it been this beautiful, this delicious, or even occupied with this many people at one time.  The head chef Brian Howard, who I've read about in LV Weekly and Seven magazine, really has something special here - it's more than just a meal.  My experience began with a drink:  - \"Get off my Lawn\" ($14) - a Camus v Cognac served with a technique to initiate its full enjoyment. A flipped sniffer glass arrives sitting atop singed cedar wood to encapsulate a smoky aroma. Once turned right-side up, a house cooked bacon slice is place inside at the base, and before pouring your classy booze, a thinly sliced orange peel wraps around the inside and rim to secure that hint of citrus flavor. Sounds like work, but damn, smells so good and goes down so smooth.  \"I'll have another please!\"  Ordering food is suggested to be done so from the left to right (cold to hot) of the menu, so the first round was this:  - Lamb tartare ($13) - gorgeous, light, fresh, and served with bhatura bread - Farm Egg ($11.50) - this one actually surprised me. Asparagus (two-ways) never tasted so good to me. Really cleaned up this one.  Before the hot round, the Urban Seen Chopped Salad ($12) was ordered to freshen the palate and prep for the next course.  Simple yet several ingredients assembled for this bowl of lightly dressed leaves. I could never put together a salad like this. That's because Sparrow + Wolf works directly with a local source specifically to produce all their greens, and I'm glad they do, it was great.  And now to the main attraction:  Beef Skewers ($18) - deliciously cooked beef bites with chickpeas, served with a side of crepes.  Damn that's clever. Campfire Duck ($21) - Three well-marinated duck strips along with a thick piece of foie gras made this dish my favorite of the night. Made me wanting more.  Since the closing of the former establishment, this neighborhood spot has kept me curious until it's grand opening yesterday.  Today, my visit and experience has satisfied the anticipation and only leaves me curious for more.  How are the other dishes and cocktails?  What will be on the next menu?  Will there be a happy hour??  I look forward to it all",

My date and I tried a variation of different small shareable plates. These plates were very much portioned for two people, but the flavors from each dish made up for the small portions. So please take into account, if you plan to bring a family here just note majority or all of the items on the menu is not made for family style.  Besides the amazing food, the ambience and low lit setting is a nice touch for a romantic and nice chill relaxed vibe. They do have a nice size bar for plenty of seating but the beer list isn't all the great...their cocktail menu is the star of the show and I highly recommend you pick from there for a drink of choice. You will not be disappointed. I had two different cocktails, one of them that was prepared in a white mug that I think was an elephant? Doesn't matter, that drink was damn good! I did order dessert and I got their ice cream sandwich which boasted with unheard of flavors for an ice cream sandwich. It had a crunch and it had like the sorta gingery finish. Again, I wolfed mine down as soon as it hit the table, and my date couldn't finish hers so I ate hers too! Winning!!! Overall, I can't wait to come back. I hope to drop in just to vibe and have a beer after work since I work across the street. Good job guys! I hope to see you guys stay and succeed for many many years to come",

    "text": "This restaurant is located at the same plaza with Macy's so there's no problem finding parking space, which is a plus.  We had a reservation made but it didn't seem like necessary for the Friday night, maybe this restaurant would be busier later the night.  We check the menu online before this Vegas trip, however, the menu they are serving now is a bit different - no more bone marrow dumplings or campfire duck. So we ordered one of the Chef Special with Fig & Foie Gras $24.00, Spanish Octopus $21.00, and Braised Lamb Neck $42.00.  Chef Special with Fig & Foie Gras - At first you can't find the foie gras so it looks like just a bunch of figs, but it's hiding underneath the figs. Display was beautiful but the taste... foie gras was OK but miso paste was really salty and figs were sweet. I think they meant to eat altogether to combine the flavor but I don't think most customers would know about it.  Spanish Octopus - It came with a huge bowl so other customer would be curious what's inside the bowl. Octopus is tender but salty and Tempura Shitake was flavorless... Another dish was made to eat altogether to combine the flavor...  Braised Lamb Neck - This was a huge dish consider it cost $42.00... The braised lamb neck itself was cooked nicely, but flavor wise it's salty and a bit spicy from the sauce. Scallion pancakes were not the traditional Asian style, it's more dryer but a good partner to eat with the lamb neck. They also offered pickled green onion and pickled daikon and both were SOUR as hell... This is my first time eating pickled green onion but you get used to the sour after some bites... The pickled daikon is a bit spicy so I like pickled green onion more.  Overall the service was good, and foods portion wise was enough and we had to get a box for the leftover lamb neck. However, all dishes we had are considered too salty so it might be suitable for heavy flavor eaters.",

First was an intimate dinner and the second time was with half my immediate family.  The third will be with my friends and family.   I don't know if there is such a thing as sexy and provocative food but this was on the cusp of that.  Enjoy my fellow Yelpers!  Our favorites not in chronological order but in level of joy:  Aged porterhouse was a melting pot of cultures. From pure meat flavor to a cornucopia of dips.   Uni was a treasure hunt - each dive was a success.   Braised lamb neck with roti-like pancakes - lots of melt in your mouth balanced flavor meat.   Foie gras - foie-get-a-bout-it - cheesy I know - foie-give-me.   Prosciutto appetizer - it'll want you to order more but remember - you have a lot coming! - so literally it did its job.    The Belgian ale and house Cab were perfect.  I love alcoholic beverages so if the level of joy is last -  then there you go.",

The plates are meant to share, but I was hungry, and it was delicious! The roasted marrow reminded me of my mom cooking round steak and letting me have the round one and marrow to suck out. There was crostini to put the marrow on. The marrow also had a peanut sauce and glaze. The lamb tartare was excellent. The broccoli was perfectly cooked. Sometimes you get when cooks try to keep it green, it's still so hard to bite. This was green and yet I could bite and chew easily. Great wait staff. Manager was so nice. He was willing to suggest other good restaurants to try in the area if I was staying for more days (which I wasn't).",

    "text": "Came here during a cousins reunion trip :) This is a really solid restaurant off the strip, you can tell they really worked hard on making their menu items unique and special. The staff here is also really nice and helpful, so def ask them for suggestions! Here's what we ordered to share, we ordered doubles of almost everything since we had 8 people:  Hearth Baked Bread $5 Great way to start off the meal, yummy warm sourdough bread. Slather on that umami butter!  Really Good Lamb Tartare $17 Honestly I didn't really love this as the lamb tasted a bit gamey and overly salted. I did love how flaky the Bahturah bread was, their version is kinda like scallion pancake but without the scallions.  Duck Confit & Sweet Potato Dumpling $16 YUM, this was really good! Loved the sauce and the crispy garlic flakes, definitely eat it all together in one bite. I actually liked how the sweet potato wasn't overly sweet, it was just a subtle hint of those flavors.  Hot Potato $15 These are potato paves, I kinda wish these were a bit more flavorful. I think it needed a lot more sauce to make the whole dish a little more moist.  Roasted Bone Marrow $21 Not sure why they give you mini forks for this dish, you definitely need a spoon haha. This was good but I think a bit oily. We also added foie gras on top of one of the orders, that was cooked really well!  Lamb Bolognese $24 I really liked this dish!!! Not sure why I decided to only get one order for the table haha but I guess we would have been overstuffed if we got two. This was made with Udon noodles instead of pasta, I always love the bouncy texture of udon.   Dry Aged Porterhouse ~$90 Very good cook on the porterhouse, the meat was nice and tender. It also comes with a variety of banchan (small dishes that usually come with korean food) - different sauces, soba noodles, spinach, etc. I don't think we used a lot of them, but it was interesting haha.   Also, I was really looking forward to ordering their lasagna but that's no longer on the menu :(.  Remember to check in on Yelp for a free glass of wine!",

    "text": "Wow the food is absolutely amazing here! The chefs are very talented! The menu changes on a consistent basis, I just hope they always have the scallops available. We had the best scallops imaginable here! The restaurant is fairly small, and extremely loud, but not so loud where you can't hear the people at your table. Every single table will be occupied. I'm not sure if they even accept walk ins, I would highly recommend making a reservation.   Cocktails: We tried a variety. They were all tasty and presented in beautiful containers. 8/10  Scallops: Again, the best scallops imaginable! We bought multiple rounds of these. 10/10  Oysters: Both raw and cooked were amazing. I personally preferred the cooked oysters though. Very buttery in the best way! 10/10  Steak Tartare: I've never been a big steak tartare fan, but with that being said, this one was pretty good. It came with garlic bread that paired wonderfully.  7/10  Duck Confit and Sweet Potato Dumplings: This was actually my first time trying duck. These dumplings were amazing! This came in a slightly bigger portion too. 9/10  Spanish Octopus: I love octopus! Unfortunately the entire table agreed that this dish was our least favorite. 6/10  I will definitely be returning again soon! I just wish the portions were slightly bigger. There was about three of everything per order. Luckily we were a party of 3, any more of us and we would of had to order multiple dishes to share.",

    "text": "I've passed by this restaurant so many times in Chinatown and the reason why I wanted to come here, without even knowing what kind of food or drink they served, was the fact that I dug the name. Sparrow + Wolf! So cute. I finally did make my way here for Restaurant Week because I noticed they had a tasting menu and the price wasn't bad for what I was getting.  When I arrived, I was sat at the bar (chair for one), but I was perfectly fine with that because I like sitting at the bar to eat and talk to the bartenders making drinks. One of the bartenders there immediately handed me a glass of water and began going over the menus with me. She took the time to answer my questions and I decided that, yup, I wanted to try the menu for Restaurant Week. I even got a glass of wine because I checked in on Yelp.  The first course came pretty quickly. In fact, the timing of my food was pretty awesome because as soon as I finished one dish, the next one was already arriving within that course.  The first item I received within the first course was the wood roasted Romanesco & sugar snap peas with Thai chili and coconut. It was light and delicious.  Then came the swordfish aguachile with fennel, pineapple, lentil cracker. The swordfish aguachile was soft, but tasted a lot better when I put it on the lentil cracker and had that contrast of crunch.  The steak tartare with shiitake mushroom, kizami wasabi, egg yolk was my favorite. It came with a slice of bread that was charred in some places, but I liked that. The steak tartare tasted amazing.  With the second course, the Viking Village scallop with ramp pesto, marinated eggplant came out next. I love scallops and this tasted yummy. I wish there had been more than one scallop, but it's a tasting menu, after all.  The all-day braised lamb neck with sherry glaze, crunchy stuff and the broccolini with avocado, poblano chili, garlic and lemon arrived together. The lamb neck was super delicious, though with a little too much glaze, and the broccolini was a little too crunchy for me.  The third course was a brown sugar cake with strawberry and Thai basil. I don't particularly like strawberry all that much, but it went well with the cake, and I ate it all up.  There was a little too much seasoning here and there, but overall I enjoyed my tasting menu, and I assume the portions will be a lot better when it's a regular sized meal. The interior was very pretty and the bartenders were super awesome. They put on a show while making drinks, and discussed drink making in between my courses.  Sparrow + Wolf wowed me with their Restaurant Week menu and their friendly staff. I can't wait to come back and eat dinner here with my friends.",

They used to have beef cheek dumplings that tasted much better than the sweet potato dumplings but they are still good. The bone marrow is a must when ordering along with the asparagus.   Sparrow +Wolf is a restaurant that pushes boundaries with their menu but doesn't disappoint and is done with the utmost care taking into consideration the flavors of each item on the plate.   What is always a hit or miss is the service. My last experience there we had a waiter that was rude and tried to limit us on how much to order (I had only ordered 3 dishes at the time) the dishes were small but even if they weren't I felt it to be an extremely rude and out of place comment for her to make especially when I had not asked her thoughts on it.   This is my reason for my 3 star review. If the staff were not rude and trained better they would have a full 5 stars.",

    "text": "We had an amazing dinner at Sparrow + Wolf.  The service was incredible with our waiter explaining in great detail about some of the dishes we were interested in ordering.  Our glasses were always filled with water and even random staff passing by were helpful when we had questions.  Plus, I loved how the dark and stylish ambiance was reminiscent of the 60s.  The food was creative and tasty.  Dishes are meant to be shared family-style so we ordered appetizers, sides, and a main entree.  The trout \"chips and dip\" was so interesting: trout roe, fried trout skin, and a trout \"dip\" with some potato chips.  The foie gras appetizer was delicious: fried foie gras sandwiched between toast with peanut butter and shallot jam.  I thought the roasted white asparagus with bearnaise sauce and nori was reallllly good.  I was hoping for more filling in the duck confit and sweet potato dumplings - with 5 per order, I definitely wished we'd had a few more.  The main dish of the night was a 32 oz, 55-day aged porterhouse steak ($95) with a miso-rub (?) that came banchan-style with 5 small side dishes (giardiniera, marinated mushrooms, pickled cabbage, sauteed spinach, and noodles), 3 sauces (chimichurri, peri peri, samba oelek), a Naan-like bread with Indian spices, and a soft-boiled egg.  We ordered it medium-rare but it came rarer than expected and sliced for sharing.  I really wanted to like the porterhouse but I struggled with chewing through the pieces of rare meat and happened upon some with gristle that I simply couldn't chew through.  My family, however, enjoyed the porterhouse so I was happy about that.  Overall, the entree was confusing for me but I'm glad we tried it.",

It is not that big of a restaurant, so I am glad that I made a reservation for three, though it was not completely packed at 7PM on a Friday either. The interior is very modern and lighting was on the darker side.  Our waitress was okay. She was friendly and kept using my first name but didn't really check on us much during the middle of the meal. There was a slight feeling of disinterest that tarnished the meal.  The menu is not that big, and we went for the bento box. It was a beautifully presented and executed assortment of charcuterie (cured meats + cheeses), oysters, shellfish, and fish/steak tartare. I could taste the quality of the food and appreciated the balanced and creative flavors. We also got a detailed explanation of all of the box components when it was first served.  For dessert, we tried the pavlova which was a very interesting texture and taste.  Prices were not outrageously high but also not inexpensive. Portions were as expected for a higher-end place, though the three of us left satisfied after the bento box. I think the bento box is a good value at $75 overall.  I am glad I tried Sparrow + Wolf and enjoyed my dining experience, even though service was not quite as genuine as I would have liked on this visit.",

We had a trout dish (don't remember the name) served with house made potato chips. It was tasty but unmemorable. Wouldn't get it again.   In the \"id get it again\" category:  The charred octopus was great. The Foie of the night was served in a sandwich...it was AMAZING.   We ended with the dry aged porterhouse. Only comment about the porterhouse is that sambal and chimichurri are sauces, not banchan.  -1 star for the service. Our service was stupendous up through our entree. Then we were forgotten for 10-12 min. We made eye contact with and waved at 2 different members of the staff and they didn't come to our table. I won't go into details but shared the opportunity for improvement with their General Partner John.  No chance to review dessert because the poor service at the end signaled to us that it was time to leave.",

    "text": "Lamb Bolognese lasagna was spot on with perfect combo of crispy cheese and pieces of soft marinated lamb. Taking half a star off as the dish was lacking a bit of salt and was on the bland side. I guess good for those who don't need salt in their diet  Honey cake. Perfectly complemented with candied almond ice cream and blueberry compote this dessert was my favorite  I will bring my partner here next time but definitely skip on the drinks and go straight for the great food options  Awesome place just a couple of miles off the strip. Definitely gives most of the strip joints a run for their monies",

When I went there were plenty of people in the restaurant and it made it feel very upscale casual. I came here after eating at another restaurant. I went with my friends and ordered one of each dessert. The menu at the time had Caramelized Honey Toast, Coconut-Kaffir Panna Cotta, Vanilla Bean Pavlova, and Roasted Peanut Ganache Bar.  From best to worst:  Panna Cotta, Honey Toast, Ganache and Pavlova  Coconut Kaffir Panna Cotta: Honestly this was so delicious. It wasn't heavy and overly creamy like a typical panna cotta. It was light but still creamy and rich. The kaffir lime flavor was a nice contrast to the creaminess and balanced the dish very well over all. The ganache was a bit on the heavier side so I definitely think that this dessert could be for 2 people The pavlova for me was disappointing. It was overly sweet and I wasn't a fan of the meringue I personally felt that it was a bit too crunchy.",

The place is busy or was when we visited but everyone seemed to take it in stride - the staff was amazing. We got a mix of oysters to start the night, then moved across several recommended plates including the lamb tartar, scallops, and finished with the market rate Porterhouse steak. That Porterhouse was unreal and so good. It was not cheap at $85 I think but was a big piece of well prepared meat. The char on the outside was rich and tasty but the steak was prepared rare which made us all very happy.   Oh, and the bread here is mind-blowing.   This place goes toe to toe with the best other big cities have to offer. Well worth the visit.",

Staff are friendly and several people came to check on us throughout the meal.    Beverages:  Great assortment of cocktails, modest wine list  We ordered a large assortment of tasty and creative fusion dishes:  - Oysters:  These were fresh and juicy oysters from British Columbia baked in miso - Uni Trout Roe In Celery Root:  the Uni was a little lost in the mash of celery root - Bone Marrow:  generous serving of fatty bone marrow.  We opted to add seared foies gras to this..piling on the richness - Grilled Octopus with Tempura Shitake:  This dish was underwhelming because the octopus was a tad too charred and dry.   - Braised Lamb Neck:  amazingly tender, fall-off-the-bone lamb was moist and buttery with softest fat that melts on the tongue.  This dish comes with a chive onion pancake that can be used a \"taco\" for the lamb. - Porterhouse:  Aged for 45 days, this was the star of the evening  Tapas typically outshine entrees, but this was surprisingly not the case at Sparrow+Wolf.  Prices are moderate so you can have a fantastic meal without breaking the bank.",

    "text": "Frequently asked by regional pharmaceutical representatives for suggestions on where to hold meetings Sparrow + Wolf has become a top choice, the addition of a PDR comfortable for twenty expanding possibilities while Brian Howard's Food opens eyes to what is feasible rather than just what is comfortable.  Now in its third year of operation, the buzz died down but crowds still present at volumes that keep the Restaurant busy seven days a week, it is upon entering the foyer featuring Christmas Story's leg lamp that guests are greeted by a hostess, reservations confirmed and seating offered in one of two rooms or at a bar that is frequently found full of industry workers.  Fully occupying the Private Dining Room and Library during this visit, multimedia outlets allowing for a thirty minute presentation while dining on a tasting menu pre-selected by Chef Howard, it was with a glass of Bubbles $3 cheaper than one will find on The Strip that Bread was delivered, the housemade rounds still steaming when broken and Butter flecked with Nori quickly melting and soaking into a pillowy crumb coated in Seeds.  Served in three family-style courses, none of them 'dumbed down' despite a crowd that featured many guests more accustomed to events at Bonefish Grill or Del Frisco's, it was with service befitting the situation that John Anthony and team made sure everything progressed smoothly, round one's Steak Tartare outstanding yet somewhat polarizing considering the crowd while wood-fired Romanesco with Thai inspiration and Swordfish Aguachiles that bounced back and forth between sweet and savory both showed the kitchen's confidence with bold flavors and ingredients less commonly utilized.  Perfectly paced despite a throng of reservations for Restaurant Week, Brian later claiming that Sparrow + Wolf's special menu offers the \"best value in town,\" it was just as the speaker came to her finish that course two flooded four tables, the assortment of \"American Banchan\" grabbing attention and holding it with Miso Spinach, creamy Octopus and Potato Pave while the 65-Day Dry Aged Porterhouse basted in Miso Butter delighted all but the rare guest who still thinks \"Well\" is the only appropriate temperature for a Steak.  Not nearly finished, the Duck and Sweet Potato Dumplings previously felt compromised by too much Chili Oil now more refined including a thinner skin, fans of heat should additionally order grilled Broccolini served alongside raw Avocados and poignant Poblano Peppers while everyone in Las Vegas that isn't Vegetarian should request at least one baked Sweet Potato topped in Salted Plum Creme Fraiche and snappy bits of housemade Chinese Sausage.  Adding an off-menu bonus, the combination of Scallops and Foie Gras recently seen at Michelin 3* Restaurant Vendome presented by Chef Howard as a complex Carpaccio with heterogeneity of texture as well as temperature amidst herbs and acid, it was with three Desserts that dinner reached its conclusion, the lack of Honey Toast disappointing at least a handful though the Chocolate Bar and Blueberry Tart both shined despite restrained sweetness while Coconut Panna Cotta proved a favorite for those seeking something light.",

We're not fancy food people, but we've been to our share of fancy restaurants, and S+W was a real treat for us.   Every dish we had was unique in its own way. In a world of bland gastropub food that sounds more exciting than it is, every dish we tried was fantastic in its own right. We had the dumplings, asparagus, oysters, and skate (fish), and we were thrilled with the different flavors and care that went into each dish. It felt like our tastebuds had woken up after a long slumber living in the meh-food city of Denver.   Also, the service was fantastic all night. Our water cups were literally never empty, and we got fancy food service in a relaxed bar atmosphere where we didn't feel dumb for wearing hoodies (we were fresh off the airplane). Money-wise, expect to pay about $50/person before drinks and tip, and it's worth every penny.",

But $5 for one roll is highway robbery. In my opinion the meal went way down from there. The steak and frites were tasteless. My potstickers were so chewy I didn't eat them. We were very disappointed the halibut they had on the menu was not being offered, apparently their fish monger was providing bad halibut. It's summer, halibut is great this time of year   It was also very warm in the restaurant , the hostess advised their air conditioning was not working great. With all the new restaurants opening around town, we were so turned off by the entire dining experience. The management didn't try and make our dining experience any better. Two thumbs down.

    "text": "Reading reviews and seeing the previous menu, I wasn't sure if we were going to dig this place, I was worried it would be tryhard with no actual substance. I'm very happy to say it was not! The staff were super nice and professional from beginning to end. What we chose from the menu was flavorful and interesting: I could have eaten a bucket of the salmon poke ( I wish the puffed rice cake had been a little sturdier to actually have with the salmon, but it was a light little snack between intense bites). This night had a \"fried\" whole mackerel dish with veggies and it was light and the perfect portion. My husband had the Beef Short Rib with rich red glaze. He loved it. The cocktails are great too, my server was quite knowledgeable and helped me pick the perfect after dinner drink, but the Burn The Witch lives in my heart. We're very happy we finally stopped in, I'll be keeping an eye out for the next roll-out! Thanks, everyone.",

    "text": "We saw an article about the hot new restaurants in Vegas and we love to eat at restaurants off of the strip as the food is generally more interesting and much less expensive so we made a reservation at Sparrow and Wolf.  Sparrow and Wolf did not disappoint!! The restaurant has such a cool vibe and smells amazing when you first walk in.  The chef/owner is very passionate about his restaurant and stops by all the tables to make sure everyone is taken care of and describes items on the menu and makes suggestions.  We took all of his suggestions and everything was amazing.  The fresh halibut was unbelievable, super flaky with such flavor.  The mushroom dish had a unique blend of hummus, mushrooms and crispy potatoes that worked great together.  We enjoyed everything that we tried.  Brian was super friendly and even invited us in to the kitchen for a peak.  We will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu.  One of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!!",

My friend and I came during happy hour (from 5-6:30 pm) and decided to sit at the bar. She ordered champagne and I got the gnome drink which came in this cute copper gnome but honestly just tasted like a really bad Moscow mule. We ordered a few appetizers including the bread, mushrooms, charcuterie and hamachi which was by far the best thing we had. The charcuterie was nearly inedible. Seriously, really bad. And the other two dishes were average. Nothing to write home about. The thing that bothered me the most about this place though was the service. Some of the most unfriendly bartenders I've come across in awhile. We had to flag them down every time we needed something. They never checked in on us on their own and it was NOT busy the night we went. It's like we were an inconvenience every time we asked for something and they couldn't be bothered. I don't know, maybe we just came on a bad night? I would definitely consider coming again to give it a second chance. But my first impression was not a good one.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had reason to celebrate and used it as reason to finally try Sparrow + Wolf. We were not disappointed. Everything from the cocktails and wine to dessert were exceptional.  They weren't offering the chef's tasting menu, so we created one of our own. Here are some of the highlights:  You might not want to spend $5 for bread, but it is worth it! You'll be talking about its rustic goodness and the umami butter for days.Our charcuterie plate included wonderful poached pears and beets for pairing with the various cheese.  The Uni Melt was everything yummy other reviews have claimed it to be.  The Japanese sweet potato was a revelation. I expected root vegetables in a sauce. But it's presented as a traditional American baked potato but includes tastes you've never considered as part of that homey side dish before, especially the plum creme fraiche.  The only potential disappointment was the lasagna. The round plating is ingenious and inviting. But it arrived way too hot to eat, then ultimately found it dry. In our mind it needs a more prominent bechamel sauce.   But this was completed made up for by the Wagyu beef with chanterelle mushrooms. It was one of the specials that night, but if you get lucky like we did, do yourself a favor and dive into the succulent, perfectly cooked dish.  We finished the evening with a brioche dream of a dessert. It was like an elevated French toast and I already want to go back and have it again.",

    "text": "I really wanted to be tougher on this place, but, alas, instead it proved itself a worthy gem in the crown of the ever-burgeoning local Las Vegas restaurant scene. Conspicuously designed and plopped right in the heart of the humble, gritty, authentic Las Vegan Chinatown that already boasts a lively yet rightfully sincere array of brilliant eateries and options, Sparrow + Wolf overcomes its \"try-hard\" name and west LA envy with a disciplined, focused menu and high-level yet simple wine offerings that will leave any patron remiss for anything negative to say. Our party started with fresh Baja oysters which were exceptional in quality (usually they are overpriced and undersized at most places due to lack of discernment in selection). Moving on to lamb dumplings -- which offered house-made dumplings and exceptional lamb amidst a brilliant yet tangy reduction -- my only tip would be the dumplings were a touch too doughy and not enough texture despite the handcraftmanship (a simple cure of an extra 30 seconds on heat or perhaps higher heat). We also took in a wild mushroom dish over a hummus which was outstanding but the hummus clouded the spotlight and could be taken off the plate without a tear shed. Amongst a few other offerings, the star was the bone marrow offering -- which was rounded out and served with escargot. One of the best and balanced bone marrow offerings I've had in Las Vegas, this dish was a real star and substantial as well for a ridiculously great $18 price tag. Accompanying everything was a bright, brilliant blanc de blanc by Ruinart that truly, even if less so by the establishment's knowledge than by default, represents truly one of the best and most versatile champagnes to compliment much of their menu. Will be back and I didn't think I'd be so pleasantly surprised. Well done.",

It takes some real \"Hubris\" to make such a statement--Chef Brian Howard's creation though lives up to the bravado!  I erroneously had the impression that this was an Asian Fusion restaurant which is why I took so long to agree to our reservation.  I am so happy that I bended on my aversion for all things \"Fusion!\"  I have never found a neighborhood cookery that takes such care of their cocktails, and innovations in food.  I love their clams casino, Udon, Spanish octopus, and even German Butterball potatoes (not the Peter Luger version, but really a wonderful complex of flavors).  You must try the bone marrow dumplings, and pork shank.  Finally the heirloom tomatoes with fresh watermelon makes your meal an event.  Lastly, unlike most meals the food is not heavy, and will leave you with a satisfying feeling late into the Las Vegas night so you can even hit the tables.  This is a concept that should branch out to America.  However, the dedication of staff is hard to duplicate.  I cannot wait until my next visit.  Does this qualify for All Madden status--No!  However, Sparrow and Wolf takes American Cuisine to the perfect blend of Old and New World casual street food!  Right in Las Vegas Chinatown--Up the beaten road off the Las Vegas Strip!",

Saw on Yelp that there was happy hour which I was excited for but came here with a buddy and the bartender said the only happy hour was for drinks. Little bummed but whatever.  Took a look at the menu and man there were some pricey entrees. But by reading the reviews, figured I would get a good bang for my buck. Since my buddy and I were here for the drinks we focused on that and just got a full monty cheese and charcuterie plate and a skate wing.  To be fair the drinks were good. Beers on tap were great and they have some good choices on tap. The food however was the issue. You would think a cheese and charcuterie plate would be filled with a variety of meats or something but all we got were 4 thin slices of meat, a few cheeses, a slice of pate, and a few pickled vegetables. Granted they did taste pretty good but I thought it was hardly worth it for $26. The skate wing was also good but man it's hard to justify it for $26. For some people who eat here price may not matter, but if you are looking for good happy hour that will fill you up, has great food and is not that pricey, there are plenty of other places in Vegas which will suit your needs. Three stars just because I can't really justify the price for the food.",

It felt as if they were trying too hard--there was too much going on with each item--too many competing flavors. We had the Hamachi Carpaccio, the Steak Tartare, the Japanese Sweet Potato, the Wood Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, the Beef Short Rib, the Campfire Duck and, of course, the bread. As we were eating, we discussed whether perhaps our disappointment was colored by our expectations, and we all agreed (all 4 of us) that wasn't the case--the food was just lacking. We really wanted to like this place, and am sad to say it fell short.",

    "text": "Service: I made reservations here for my sisters birthday on 9/14/2017 (1 week prior to the reservation date) for 16 people and called and confirmed it that same day to make sure my sister b-day would go as planned and reminding them it's for birthday. The lady on the phone informed me that the manager might call me to tell me about a pre-fixed menu for the large party. I never received a call until the day of my reservation at 2:30 pm and the manager was calling to confirm my reservation and he asked me how many people will be joining the dinner because if its more than 13 people there will be a $45 minimum for each person because it's too late to make a prefixed menu for our party. So I was given 30 minutes to confirm how many people will be showing up to our dinner. I was confirmed 12 people which allowed us to be in a semi-private area which was really nice looking. I called the manager back and told him how many people will be attending and another reminder that it was for my sisters birthday. He said thank you for confirming the reservation and that we'll be taken care of.   When we arrived at the restaurant everything was good and we needed an extra chair cause my sisters husband attended the dinner but didn't eat. I don't think the restaurant was too fond that we needed an extra chair. since that would technically be 13 people. We were only given water once in the whole hour and a half we were there. Our waitress barely came to check on us. When we first got there all the tables were filled but it died down after 10 PM since they close at 11 PM. When I asked our waitress if I can pay a part of the bill because I had to leave earlier than everyone else she just said, \"Oh perfect! I'll bring the check right over\" when my sister and her friends were clearly drinking still. I just need to leave a lot earlier but it forced everyone else to finish up and pay. I felt bad but I guess it's my fault i wasn't more aggressive towards stating that I'm the only one that wants to leave. She didn't ask about dessert at the end all she asked was \"Is there anything else you guys want because the kitchen is closing in 5 minutes?\" So we just said no because it was kind of passive aggressive how she said it. So i guess this restaurant doesn't give a free dessert for birthdays but we weren't even offered dessert even if we paid for it. The bill was paid all cash which makes it better for them and I don't know if they split tips but it was a auto-gratuity of $80 for a server that didn't accommodate us at all.   I can hate because I work in the industry and I always make sure all guests/customers are well taken care of. Especially for huge parties like that since the tip will be auto-gratuity.  Food: We ordered 2 Bento Boxes (3-Tier assorted shellfish, 6 oysters with 3 different toppings, cured meat with bread) and 2 of the Beef Cheek Bone-Marrow Dumplings and lots of cocktails and wine (at least 13 drinks were ordered) The Bento Box had a great variety of food, I wouldn't recommend it if you are not into raw fish, but if you enjoy raw fish this is the dish to turn to.  the Beef Cheek Bone-Marrow Dumplings are good it came with 5 dumplings.  Drinks: For drinks I ordered the Spring Mountain Sour which was my favorite drink and Jump the Shark which came with a cool shark cup.   Summary: My huge downfall on this restaurant is service which is surprising cause it's new. I would only recommend coming here if it's only 2 of you. Maybe you'll be better taken care of. Don't come here in large parties. The food was so-so but the hamachi and oysters were definitely good and all their cocktails are great as well.",

This was the happenin' spot of a hot chef from the strip that opened his/her own place and I think they were gung ho from the start and have decided to coast on to destruction. Pertentious. Hipster. Overstated peasant food. Plenty of exciting new spots opening every day. Next!",

It's now 1 hour and 45min after we arrived and still waiting for our food but the table next to us who arrived 15-20 after we sat down have now received 5 dishes. It's now rather obvious that it helps to know someone here in order to receive any kind of service.  Out of 4 in our party 2 ordered the octopus,  no one ordered appetizers so all our plates were obviously, for us, meant to be main dishes. The octopus was very good but in no way enough to be an entree. Do you think our server could have said something? So we ordered 2 more dishes. When we gently asked if these dishes were going to take 45min to make like our original dishes, the waitress actually argued with us. She said because someone at the table had the pork it to  longer. Interesting customer service! There again, do you think she could have said something to begin with? What a shame! The food is actually rather good but man does the service suck. Our server prefers to dance behind the bar area than come to our table and ask if everything is ok.  I gave 3 stars but it's actually 4 for the food and a very BIG 1 for the service.",

Table ready when we arrived, seated quickly.   Our server came out and explained the menu and drinks to us, to include what wasn't listed on the menu.   Two ordered drinks, Jump the Shark, and a German slushie(I think). The ladies that ordered them loved them.   We did the heirloom tomato salad as a start and the made in house sourdough bread. Great bread, and the tomatoes salad was fresh, tasty and perfectly seasoned.   Entrees were the big a$$ pork shank, duck, beef skewers, and the beef dumplings. All were great, but the pork was amazing. Portions were very good sized and perfect for sharing.   Desert was a lemon tart and the beignets plate. All fantastic.   We are locals and foodies. It was a very pleasant surprise to see a local-off strip restaurant that knocked it out of the park. Great decor, outstanding service, and the chef knows his flavour combinations and can really cook.   We will be back. Highly recommended for locals and tourists alike.",

    "text": "Although it was a Monday evening, the restaurant was busy - it didn't take long to figure out why; classy and cozy ambience, friendly staff, delightful dishes, and well curated alcohol choices.   Had our aunt and uncle not awaited and prepared dinner for us, we would've indulged in our sensory beyond 4 dishes: Hamachi, clam, foie gras, and lobster tail. Our favorite is definitely the hamachi!   Despite the wonder of this place, our experience was unfortunately a bit misplaced due to a rude couple sitting next to us. They conspicuously mocked us for taking photos of our food before indulging. They are free to think and feel as they please, but they should have the courtesy to keep it to themselves for a later time and settings. We thought it was obvious to them that what they are doing was rude by the stern look we gave them, however, they had the audacity to take a picture of us taking a picture of our food. At that point in time, we confronted the woman (the man stepped out at this point) first about their misconduct, who denied both discussing anything about us and taking the photo. We felt that it was not worth it to take it further as it was suffice to stand up for ourselves. Not long after the man returned and shouted at us that we were tacky for taking photos and stormed out threatening to put us on Facebook. We were so appalled by this misconduct, but surely it didn't take long that it was brought to the attention of our host, John, who came to commiserate with us. His commiseration was unexpected, but definitely appreciated. Thank you, John and to the staff that went the extra step!  We detailed this experience, because we hope that no one will ever have to go through what we went through and inspire others to be respectfully to each other even if we have differing opinions. Every one should be able to have a pleasant dinning experience.   Overall, we were left with a mix of discombobulation, gratefulness, and delighted palette that night. Nevertheless, we look forward to second round without the misconduct.",

We sampled quite a few of the items,  and if our stomachs were bigger,  we likely would have sampled more.   First service.  They were very busy and the staff worked together liked a fine tuned machine.  Around me were several large groups,  the service never skipped a beat.  We order a bottle of wine and had a great talk with manager John about the bottle.  If I lived here, we would probably try to drink with him regularly.  Very personable,  it's like we all knew each other for years.    Most importantly the food.  Where do I start.  Everything looked so good.  We started with beef tartar,  then worked our way to the charcuterie.  What a pleasant surprise with the tartar.  It had a wonderful texture and light vibrant flavors,  it was cut slightly larger then what is typically served,  but in a good way.  Next,  beef cheeks and bone marrow dumpling.  We added the bread per our servers recommendation,  you know for dipping in the sauce after.  Which was spot on.  The bread... don't skip it,  it is lovely.  Nice crust on the outside,  soft and fully on the inside.  Lastly,  we share the duck and pork shank.  Oh my!  Phenomenal!  Best duck we have ever had.  The pork shank is like southern comfort food,  just needed a side of cheese grits.   Will definitely return!",

The sweetbread was also highly recommended, which was too rich and soaked in oil. It was described as a cross between chicken and pork, and after trying sweetbread, chicken and pork is a rather gross combination.   Our food took forever to come out. The restaurant is very cramped.

If u are a corona guy then this is not for u.. they have upscale beers and is definitely a culinary adventure. Wanted to try the bone marrow but went with the duck confite... price is not an issue but be prepared to spend $50/person. The reviews sold us and we made U-turn to come back and try. Great date place. Enjoy.",

Had to let the server know and he alerted the manager. They took care of the least expensive item we ordered but not the item in question (duck). Perhaps bc he reheated the duck () which made it hot but dried out. I did notice that both the manager and the hostess were serving food to the tables so this could be bc they were short staffed?  The big ass pork shank arrived steaming hot and was excellent!  Food was great and kitchen may not be the issue. Just needed to be more alert to bring the food while still hot to the guests.

We waited 40 minutes for a table when the hostess told us it would only take 15-20 minutes. This is a crowded environment and it is loud. You will turn and hit another person. In order to talk to someone, you will need to yell for them to hear you. The restrooms are also crowded. In the women's restroom, there are only two available stalls. A problem I came across was not being able to reach for the seat liner, because it was too tall. Some of the workers are unorganized, forgetting an order or where it came from. I noticed the glasses and utensils were dirty, (they were not washed and dried properly), you can see water residue. Other than that, it took 8 minutes for us to order and 45 minutes for the food. Although, the introduction to the food was great and the food itself was (4 1/2)/5. The Udon I had was still a tad undercooked. It was a bit hard and chewy compared to how it is normally served. The Udon and Halibut had a bit too much sauce and seasoning for the dish itself. Besides that, the Udon, the Halibut, and the Full Monty were all excellent. The Calamansi Tarte was amazing! (That's coming from a Filipino!)",

    "text": "The lower stars is due to not enough choices on menu, overly small tapas size even for me, and overpriced for what you are getting! The food was amazing here my only gripe is the menu is very small and the portions are smaller than appetizer size it's kind of annoying. These are probably the smallest tapas portion I have yet to eat. When I go to fine dining the portions are large so I share. Hence my bill is about the same as here.The small bone marrow was delicious and was over $30. The 1 1/2 ounces of fish was over $30. My 2 drinks amazing each one was about $14.00. My guest ordered one thing on menu basically bread and butter for $15.00. A lot of dishes are made to put on bread. I am mostly gluten- free and they had little to no options here.I took someone here and they were not interested in anything on the menu.The food is very heavy and some dishes have bread used as part of dish. I really wanted the scallops the healthiest choice on menu but they were all out. I have heard of appetizer portion size but the portions are beyond small.By the time I ordered 2 things on menu,because I was hungry,and one tapas plate of fish is not enough for 1 person and 2 drinks my bill was about $75+. I eat at scotch prime for example and honestly this is about the same price by the time you order a few things. If you are wearing a tight outfit be prepared.I enjoyed this but it's small very cramped and honestly overpriced for what you get.I would rather spend $100 on the strip fine dining honestly.Since my bill is about the same.",

    "text": "I wanted to love it, I really did.  Arriving early for our reservation, I thought we could have a drink at the bar.  We were told we could go stand at the and of the bar and order a drink...because all the bar seats were taken.  The reason seems to be is that the bar is treated like a really long dining table, so there is no place to get a drink other than at the end of the bar, where you are dodging staff trying to do their jobs.  What happened to a bar being a bar?    Once seated, we waited approximately 15 minutes with no service, so we asked a passing server if he might be able to help us.  Thankfully, he agreed, and did a great job.  The cocktails are creative and well made, and by that time, we needed one.  As for the food, it is also creative and beautifully presented.  Unfortunately, the portions for shared plates are very small, and expensive.  If you want bread, for instance, its $6 for a loaf slightly larger than a baseball.  Really?  The other dishes range from $12 to $18, but are so small, sharing really means you get a bite of something.  The restaurant itself is really well done with a great vibe and lively crowd.  I was surprised how little seating there was though.  Its a good sized space, but the kitchen seems to take up most of it.   Maybe its just me, but I'm looking forward to the end of the shared plates craze, when you can go into a restaurant for an actual meal.  Again, I was excited to try this place out, and I would say it had great potential, if it wasn't already so busy.  Maybe its just not for me.",

    "text": "My God. What a find. Sort of stumbled in here late Friday night in Chinatown. This is a must try. Lemme try and break it down.  Walked in, ambience is chill, sort of minimalist modern, dark blues and blacks. Sat at the bar, can sort of see into the kitchen, everyone in the place is dressed nice, but no jacket required. Dig the vibe.  Ordered a drink to start, the wife had \"Have Knives Will Travel\" sort of a sweeter, smokey old fashioned. I had the \"Spring Mountain Sour,\" the house take on a whiskey sour, came with a big dollop of beet foam, maybe it was a little pink but dammit that was fresh, the sweet/salty foam pairing perfectly with the whiskey and the citrusy sour. Do yourself a favor and get this one.  For starters, the charcuterie. This is when I knew we were in for a great meal. Culatello ham and soppressata, served with some sort of magical pickled yams/yellow beets/hell-if-I-know-but-super delicious, homemade mustard and grilled bread. Yes.  Next we had the grilled octopus. JESUS. It was fantastic. Seriously it was tender, tasted like octopus not fishy or overly cartilaginous, it was that perfect texture and seafood/shellfish goodness that's so hard to hit. If you've been to Marea in NYC, seriously it was like that braised octopus fusilli. Forgot the pic, consumed it too quickly.  A note on the timing, it was legit restaurant good. Like, we had good time between drinks, apps, starter, main dish. It felt like a prix fixe, but we just ordered off the regular menu. The details man, the details.  Next we had sweetbreads and the beef cheek/bone marrow dumplings. Dammit if they weren't fantastic as well. I'm legitimately upset bc none of you will believe the meal was so good. You just gotta try it. The dumplings were umami bombs, just pure beefy essence of greatness. The sweetbreads were the essence of culinary gestalt, served with bacon wrapped endive, caramelized shallots, watercress, and peas. I don't even like peas but the way they all worked together was redonkulous.  The bar tenders were awesome, cool people who appreciate good food and drinks. So nice to see and visit a legit good food place that serves in a down to earth manner, not pretentious. The manager, John Anthony, was out making the rounds and seemed like a regular dude who loves his job. Respect.  Will definitely be back, with friends. You gotta try it.",

    "text": "Overall I enjoyed my time here! They serve tastey and well cooked dishes all made with quality ingredients. The plates are creative and offer just enough flare to keep you interested as you eat.  But with unpolished ideas and mediorce service, I cant give this place a 5 star review in my opinion. It was definitely worth trying once, but the experience didnt match the price tag here. Personal note: the honey toast for dessert was DELICIOUS.  I would go back just for that scrumptious plate  I should've known better with this store being in China town, but there is alot of Asian fusion food here and ALOT of seafood. That isnt a problem, but this is just a heads up. The tags they have on Yelp amd Google are not accurate. Granted the seafood and Asian theme of the menu could have been seasonal, but I would classify this restaurant as seafood.  Yes it is totally fusion food, but heavily sourced from the ocean. The aroma of fish filled the air (not raw fish, cooked) which isnt a bad thing, but not the thing I was expecting nor desiring. \"International bites\" doesn't quite sum up what the serve.  I was in Vegas for the weekend with my wife and I decide to try a place off the strip, somewhere local. I personally love trying new food so we found this place. It is very swanky inside, with almost a Mediterranean vibe. It is very comfortable to dine here.  They make due with the space they have, so you will be in close quarters with other customers. You could even make a new friend. It is DARK. I felt like an old man using my flashlight in my phone to read the tiny font on the menu and also to just see what I was eating. Presentation is an integral part of any dining experience and the only food art you could appreciate was that of the veggies, but that's just cause veggies are colorful.  No big deal but come on people, let us see and appreciate what you're serving.   Calm shades of blues and greys adorn the stoney walls, and this could have been done to keep you from flipping out over the slow service. Maybe they were having an off night, but no amount of sweet and cute waitresses and charming waiters can make up for the haul of a 90+ minute dining time. There was a blatant lack of attendance to us and even the group next to us. We made jokes with the table of 4 about how it took so long because the cooks had to slaughter their own lambs and fish for their own oysters.   Like I said before, it is very Asian. Miso was used in half the dishes.  But that wasnt my problem with the food, my main jab at Sparrow/Wolf is that the  composition of the plates was lacking. Continuity was poor, and what I like to call \"eatability\" or the ease of literally putting stuff on your fork to your mouth, was not there. For example, the octopus was fresh and grilled and delicious, but then it had a big ole fried veggie plopped in. I didnt appreciate the fried with something so fresh. The octopus was also left in large legs. The eataiblity of the plate was bad. It was not fun to consume. Good? Sure. But annoying. Same idea goes with the pear dish. What appeared to be dried fruit chips of some sort showered the veggie dish. Eating It was like trying to eat dry cereal with a fork. I had to stack the elements of the plate on a spoon with my fingers. The lasagna was in a very deep bowl so actually getting all the parts of the lasagna in one bite was impossible unless I used a 2nd utensil.   Bottom line to all this is that while the flavor was good, the experience was underdone...unpolished, like I said. Lack of  effective food design, overabundance of seafood (very personal opinion), low lighting, some lazy preparation, and mediorce service put just enough damper on the whole thing that spending $105 on dinner for two was only appropriate for a single visit.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I did some research and found Sparrow + Wolf.  We were super excited to try some unique cuisine off the strip.  When we arrived we were seated fairly quickly; however, it took quite some time for our server to visit our table.  That was fine as we were able to peruse the menu and put in our order as soon as the server came by.   Shortly thereafter our shareables came out.  They were all extremely tasty with the clams casino being our favorite.  Here's where it really went downhill.  The restaurant somewhat cleared and was now only about 50% full and our entrees hadn't come out.   We waited for 33 minutes until someone came back to tell us what was going on.  The comment was something to the affect like we're having a busy night but your food is coming off the grill now.  Another 10 minutes go by and still no food.  At this point my usually calm boyfriend is showing signs of frustration, so a manager comes by.  Again same story-  we're busy, this shouldn't happen your food is coming off the grill-  oh and we'll take care of the food.  So another 5 minutes pass and the food that we thought was just coming off the grill arrives at our table COLD.  We sat there, hungry and trying to flag down the manager.  In the meantime, a potato dish is sent to our table compliments of the chef.  Nice gesture, but it wasn't good.  We flag the manager down again and his response was extremely nonchalant and was like we're sorry but we already removed that from your bill and he walks away.  I was never looking to get items for free, I was simply looking for a nice, relaxing and tasty meal of which never happened.",

    "text": "LOVE this place!   Our new date-night spot located in Chinatown, away from the strip - catching all the locals for sure! Dimmed for that romantic, classic yet modern, intimate feel. You can dress up or be casual!  Jason has been our server during our visits and he's truly amazing! Knowledgeable of the menu and drink items. He's so nice, funny and great personality!  Menu consists of raw, cured or fresh items to unique, mouth watering items! Constantly changing things up, adding new specials that run out so quickly! Few items we've tried during our visits : BENTO BOX CHINATOWN CLAMS CASINO TRUFFLE WAGYU MEATBALLS  BEEF CHEEK & BONE MARROW DUMPLING BIG ASS PORK SHANK CAMPFIRE DUCK LAMB BOLOGNESE UDON HEARTH BAKED BREAD  FARM EGG  SWEETBREADS TRES LECHES BLACK SESAME CREPE SPRING MOUNTAIN SOUR  These are like portioned size, so sharing is a little hard (except the Big Ass Pork Shank, that truly was huge). I would though, like for them to add some stuff to the savory items, like for example for the Bento Box you get all these cured meats and tartares, but they'll only give you one small, grilled toast. Also, their libations are STRONG! At least for my little self. I can't handle the strong whiskey drinks, I'll give it to the Spring Mountain Sour though, the beet foam in that is so good!  I believe their goal is for presentation and quality, over quantity. Expect to spend a little here though, but it's definitely worth it!",

    "text": "This restaurant was packed so we ate at the bar. If Yelp allowed .5 stars this would be a 4.5/5. We ordered a bunch of smaller plates and shared those as opposed to getting entrees. Portions are decent sized for two but we were sharing between 3-5 of us. What we ordered:  Hearth Baked Bread - It's good bread with good butter. Would be dope if it came with the meal but not complaining.  King Salmon Poke - This dish was crazy good. It wasn't spicy but the spice for some reason coated your tongue and made it numb. On the rice puff cracker there are blood orange and lemon jelly/jam/puree that when consumed cuts through that layer of numb oil coating your tongue giving your taste buds life again.  Uni Melt - So fire. Mini grilled cheese sandwiches with uni. The blood orange and bacon jam on the side is so fire...  Barbecued Salsify - Cousin of carrot, barbecued and mixed with different spices. Never had Gochujang but it looked like it was dipped in it.  Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings - Nothing to say but fire.  Brussel Sprouts Robata - Done really well, was curious about the jungle curry as it must have been really subtle.   Wood Fired Lasagna - Not a fan of lamb but it was done really well to the point that I couldn't distinguish whether it was lamb or beef. This dish was probably the most filling as it was dense as fuck.  Their drink programs is excellent here with many different unique and instagrammable as fuck options. We ordered:  Burn The Witch - A strong tasting drink in where they light some shit on fire and place the cinnamon-y aromatic smoke in the drink. Tasted exactly like what you would expect based off reading on the menu.  Shrubbin Bubbles - A very light and sweet drink. For the....you know  Lost In The Woods - The name for some reason reminds me of Kokiri Forest. Shout out to the nerds out there. A very well done drink.  Overall this restaurant is interesting and it seems like their menu is ever-changing which is a good thing.",

    "text": "Four of us came here for a post-show dinner, having made reservations for 9:30pm.  When we walked in, it was pretty empty.  Sort of surprising for such a high rated place.  I think this just goes to show that LV is pretty saturated with good eats.  Definitely need more of this saturation our way so that not every mealtime need be a test of patience!  Our server was very nice and professional.  Drinks were good.  Brother-in-law even got one in a shark mug.  How whimsical!  We proceeded to order and started with the bento box which seemed like a great idea for the four of us. While some of the elements in the bento box were good, I don't think we were quite impressed with the presentation, especially when I think we paid $75 for it.  So I'm ok with skipping this one next time around.  Oyster toppings didn't really stand out to us and there was quite a bit of shell left in the shucked oyster.  Other things we ordered: Hearth baked bread - Good bread Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow Dumplings - good but was salty; not sure I tasted marrow Coal Roasted Beef Salad - lovely presentation, a little tough to eat with the huge tuft of pea shoots on top, tasty overall Campire Duck - fantastic, must have Halibut - came last; we were stuffed but couldn't help but gobble this one up. Perfectly cooked fish.  The only thing I didn't appreciate was that they basically threw all the food on our table in quick succession. With us still working on the bento box, the runners were trying to figure out ways to fit things on our table and I'd made a comment about slowing down the food and all they did was chuckle and scamper away. But the food kept coming.     Sadly some dishes got cold while we were trying to eat everything so they're really doing a disservice to themselves when they throw everything out at once.  We finally got our server to slow it down on our last dish and of course he made sure to mention that they had to recook the halibut. Still very nice and pro, though.  Not sure if they just wanted us out so they can close or if the chef had no concept of letting his diners enjoy their food but it was pretty damn annoying.  Anyhoo, glad we tried this place, realizing ironically maybe it's better we come here during their busy time.",

Wanting to try something new, Sparrow + Wolf seemed to be generating a lot of buzz within the community, so we came here and were not disappointed!  We started off with the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings. If you love Tacos de Cabeza, this is that same type of buttery, juicy meat. The wrapper had just the right chew, and  Hearth Baked Bread with Cultured Butter was the perfect sidekick for the dumplings, as you will need it to clean up all the goodness in the bowl! Other reviews complain about paying for bread, but hey, it's just something we've grown accustomed to in the U.S. like the tipping system, and idiotic auto-grat BS...If you don't feel like paying, don't order it...simple as that.  For a TUF guy like me, the Campfire Duck was a no brainer. Fellow TUF guys and gals will surely agree that this dish is a MUST! (TUF guy or gal- Lover of all things TRUFFLE, UNI, AND FOIE GRAS...;)  The Lamb Ragout with Udon was another winner, and  portions were perfect considering the price point, quality of ingredients used, and the caliber of chefs in the kitchen. Great to see Chefs Brian Howard and Justin Kingsley Hall (SLO-Boy) back in action! Great first visit,  and most certainly not the last! Gotta make it back for that 11pm Burger du Jour, and it would be cool to perhaps one day revisit some of SLO-Boy's signature items as well....that Griddled Bread Pudding though!

After a night out, you have endless amounts of options that will not disappoint. &  with the addition of Sparrow + Wolf they just took it up a notch.   Easily & visibly located right on the end of the Macy's strip mall 'yells' Sparrow + Wolf that you can't miss it! As I walked in I was immediately greeted. There are views of an open kitchen just blocked by glass with all chefs busy away in the back. I decided to grab a seat at the bar, it's an area I enjoy more and more rather than being at a table. You are in the constant sight of cocktails being created and all the views of the amazing dishes being served.   The energy was lively on a Wednesday night @ 8pm & gave the vibe of a restaurant that would be located in NYC, minus the small congested and overly loud places you may be use to.   Im a basic gal and of course just stuck to the norm and ordered a glass of wine. BIG MISTAKE! Do yourself a favor and look at the cocktail page. There are a variety of choices & unique options they offer.   Now, the food part! Truthfully I wanted one of everything! I can't really classify the cuisine of this place just yet because they truly had a little bit of everything! But at the end of it all, as long as a venue offers good food ambience and service, it doesn't matter. And this place did just that! I have nothing bad to say about all the dishes I ordered; himachi was so flavorful with a little kick, oysters have this amazing cucumber jelly on them, octopus that was perfectly grilled with a squid ink used for dipping. Clams are indescribable and amazing coming from the girl who doesn't like them. Udon, filling and portioned perfectly and duck that melted in your mouth.   Add this place to your list, pronto!",

The only interested thing about this app is the rice cracker since it is different than the typical tortilla chips.  Beef cheek & bone marrow dumpling - Meh, nothing different.  I could not taste the bone marrow.  Spanish Octopus  - this by far was the best dish of the evening.  The bacon bits seriously add the depth of flavor needed.  The octopus was tender.  Sweetbreads - no bueno...just a pile of mush that is too lightly dressed.  I don't give a shit about this dish.  Campfire duck - the presentation looks different than what others posted in the past.  For $34, we got a chewy small piece of duck with sinue, and a small piece of foie gras on top.  I was very disappointed in this dish.    Calamansi tart - meh.  Overall, MEH.

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place when I first read about it online. Everything I read sounds interesting and pictures of the food looks delicious but it wasn't as good an experience as I thought it would be.  I came here with my bf around 5pm today. As we walked in, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or table so we chose to seat at the table. I noticed people walking in and they all sat at the bar and my bf heard them talking about happy hour. The hostess should have asks us if we wanted happy hour at the bar or dinner at the table.  Most of the dishes had good combination of ingredients and sounded unique. We put in some orders and was debating between Campfire Duck and Pork Shoulder, the waitress suggested twice to get both.   The first order came out, called 'Chinatown Clams Casino. ' $7.50 each, pricey and it was just ok. Then 20 mins later, the second dish came out, it was Farm Egg. The dish was bland. The waitress push us three times to get the bread for dipping. The bread was $5 so I don't understand why she was trying to sell this.  The Beef cheek and bone marrow was presented beautifully but the taste was average. Our favorite was Campfire duck. We were planning to order more dishes but decided against it as the price wasn't worth it.  Their libations had interesting names. We went with Jump the Shark. It came in a cute shark cup but the drink was very acidic.  The ambience is nice for bringing dates. The food is just ok, but definitely not worth the price and the portion size. We left semi-hungry.",

We had a reservation at 8pm and we waited less than 5 minutes to be seated. This was on a Sunday night. The place was a full house though.  Every dish we ordered was perfect, no complaints from me which is surprising lol.   We ordered : Beef cheek and bone marrow dumblings Creekstone farms beef skewer Campfire duck Spanish octopus  For dessert we ordered: Calamansi tart (a must) Cream puffs (i wouldnt order again)  We also got 2 signature cocktails which also were delicious.  Spring mountain sour And i dont remember the name of the other",

The restaurant came to life as more patrons poured in and reservation is recommended.  We followed other Yelper's suggestions to order our small plate dishes.  Everything was overly salty, some had very creative sauces but over powered the main gridents.   We were not disappointed but not thrilled either.  The duck is the dish I'd recommend and take my word to skip the trout and their oysters.  Our server was nice and attentive but the bus persons were just too eager to take our plates away.  We literally have to ask for it back on several occasions.  There was no other customers waiting  and the pricing is definitely not a fast food joint.  We may repeat in a few month time but definitely won't take our visitors there.",

The only suggestion is they should serve the entrees with something. The pork was so rich and it needed either a salad or potato or white rice with it.

Farm to table, with a focus on local produce, is not a new concept, but they do it well.    We started with a huge fresh salad, whole roasted vadouvan cauliflower, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings (I'm eating only this next time), steak, chicken and some lovely desserts.  I'm not a dessert person so I don't always remember those so well. The cauliflower was not on the regular menu that night, so we had a lot of interest and jealous stares, and ended up sharing some with the table next to us.   I rarely remember to review places anymore, but I want to remember this place in Chinatown for the next time I'm in Vegas.  Everything was simple but delicious.  Saw some karaoke places on the way to the strip from the restaurant, so I wouldn't be surprised to find myself in the area again.",

We didn't know what to order as a group so we asked if they would do food tasting.  Only because we came when they open, they agreed to do the $135-$145(I forget.)/person.  There are 3 different price ranges.  We did the most expensive because everyone wanted the bone marrow and oysters.  Plus on the top of that, we ordered 3-4 bottles of wine and some cocktails.  It makes sense why the bill came out that high.  The food and service was great.  We loved the presentation when the food was delivered to us with all the kitchen staffs.  Overall, some dishes were amazing and some were so-so.  We definitely would come back here.  I posted most of the dishes on here, some I ate it before remembering to take photos.  =D",

I wish I had still had the name of the kind gent who sent us to Sparrow + Wolf because he'd be on my holiday card list for life.  From unique cocktails to outstanding sides and perfect service, this is a must-dine when you're in Las Vegas.  Freed from the pressure to turn tables at the cyclic rate, or to season (generally over-season) dishes to the \"medium palate\" that might lead to success on the strip, the team at Sparrow + Wolf are able to draw from the best local products and take risks in preparation and presentation.  Stand-outs when we were there late summer included Japanese style sweet potato, oysters, maitake mushrooms, and the amazing fresh bread.  This is the kind of food that evolves the character of a city's culinary landscape.  Las Vegas is lucky to have Sparrow + Wolf.  We're heading back to Vegas and won't miss the chance to return.",

    "text": "Sparrow + Wolf is my pick for the best dining experience Chinatown has to offer right now.  The interior is well thought out. It's a very nice remodel from when Jenny Pho was in the same location. They kept the best aspects, like the open kitchen, and gave the interior a really nice facelift. It feels very clean. The staff are warm and friendly. Quick to refill drinks, take orders, clear plates...  and they always had a smile. They were all very welcoming and it felt like they genuinely cared about what they were doing.  The food is wonderful. Brian Howard, the executive chef, has done a really good job creating a rich tapestry of flavor. We tried the beef skewers, which had a great charcoal taste like it just came off the grill (because it DID!). It was paired with a crepe and sweet and sour garbanzo bean relish, and it was a really creative dish that we both loved. Next we tried the beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and they were worth it! Again, very rich flavors. The marrow melted in our mouths.   The only thing we ordered that was a bit disappointing was the hearth baked bread. It tasted a bit bland... maybe a little salt or rosemary, or a side-dish of balsamic vinegar or something else to dip it in would add a lot to the dish. Five dollars for warm bread, when a lot of places just give you bread for free, perhaps set the expectations higher than maybe they should have been. But I feel like I can make better bread at home, so it was a disappointing pick from the menu.  For desert, we tried the lemon and blueberry Calamansi tart. It was perfectly sweet and sour. I loved the way the meringue melted in my mouth. I wish I had more!   The Sparrow has a few things we would change. For one, the music selection is confused. When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were greeted with a Notorious B.I.G. track that almost made me turn around. Next up was an old 60s anti-war tune, followed by some contemporary EDM, and then a bluesy track by Kai Straw called Hurricane. The playlist felt completely random, like each track is being decided by a roulette wheel rather than having actual thought behind creating a mood.  The other thing I would nitpick on... the spoons they gave us for the tart were huge. And when that's one of the only flaws you can find at a restaurant, well... that's pretty good.   I definitely wish the Sparrow great success here in Vegas and I will surely be coming back to try the shank and the duck.   An Honorable mention to the  general manager John. We got a change to meet John as we walked out the door and he overheard me commenting about the fire wood smell. He proceeded to show us around their kitchen and pointed out their amazing setup. I can't for the life of me remember the type of wood stove it was because I was so impressed by the GM's thoughtfulness.",

To be honest order about 3-4 dishes and share don't forget the bread if you get the artichoke it's the best thing ever to dip with.   Enjoy an amazing meal and enjoy one of the best wait staffs I've seen since going to French Laundry honestly. They're spot on with the drinks as well.

    "text": "Sparrow + Wolf is the brainchild of Chef Brian Howard, who was previously running the kitchen at Comme Ca at the Cosmopolitan. This new restaurant finally brings the farm-to-table, modern American restaurant concept off the strip, and bringing it over to the ever burgeoning popular Spring Mountain road area.  After hearing a lot of buzz about this place, I was able to finally check this place out on their opening night. The interior is really well done. It has a modern elegant/rustic casual feel to it.   Sitting down, our server took our drink orders. I partook in a lovely libation called a Lieutenant Dangle, a take on pina colada that has carrot juice mixed into it, it was splendid. I also ordered their draft of Stone Tangerine IPA, and that as well was fantastic.  Onto the food. As previously mentioned, chef Howard is doing the farm-to-table, artisinally sourced ingredient, modern American restaurant concept that people seem to be gravitating towards these days. The food here is fantastic. You can see a lot of influences in Brian's previous experiences, as well as him trying to branch out and try different things, which is always fun.   The service here is very good. They seem to have a strong GM here, which every successful restaurant needs. The servers did a good job, as did the runners and bussers. It was the opening night and those are always unpredictable, but I'm good at noticing things, and I could tell that they will improve quickly in time.  This is a brilliant, unique restaurant concept that no-one else is doing off the strip, and it is located in the most perfect location in town. I loved the ambiance of this place. Great food and drink options that are right on point in terms value. I see this becoming a super popular spot, and I will definitely be back.",

The service was also superb, both servers helping us were very prompt and friendly. The server who took the food order really knew the dishes and made great recommendations. It was great a time to order a few dishes and share with a friend or two.

It seemed like it would start off to a good experience because the manager showed up to our table and explained the menu and the different vegan options. The waitress took a year and a half to come take our drink orders and the drinks took at least 15 minutes to get to us and this was the trend for the rest of the night. There was a table next to us if a couple that the owner and waitress knew and she was over there much of the time. The food came at different times even though we all ordered at the same time and it took at least 45 minutes for the food. Which was all appetizers, nothing was a main dish so why did it take an hour for broccoli and asparagus? We were at the restaurant for 2.5 hours because they took forever for everything. We ordered a food item that we didn't even get. At that point we were there for 2 hours and were over it and wanted to leave.The place is really small too and we showed up at 530 when it was empty and we left at 8. They wouldn't split the check for us either. We had to write the totals on the back of the check and do the math ourselves with a calculator. It was completely ridiculous and I will never recommend this place. They also included a 20% tip on the check!!! I cannot believe how bad the experience was here and they expect a 20% tip?! Unbelievable. We all left this place hungry and had to get food somewhere else after. This place is a joke.",

I've been coming to Vegas since before the restaurant boom, and even with the celebrity chefs the food isn't as authentic as this. Our table quite literally begged for more of their homemade sourdough-and sure that's not usually the food item that people write a yelp review about, but the fact that they make perfect bread from scratch is an indication of the care they take.   Hanger steak was perfect. Fried trout was the best I've had since a beach restaurant in Mexico where they caught and filleted the fish on the spot. The dessert, zomg.

My husband, who normally has a very limited palate, found the extraordinary ways that they combined everyday ingredients into 5-star restaurant quality dishes to be exceptional.  The brussel sprouts dish was an ideal example of this talent and ability that the chefs possess.  We will definitely be back, and often!",

The drinks are definitely one of a kind, absolutely deliciously unique - we ordered the Scrooge McDuck and Safeword. Truly enjoyed their raw seafood treats, the flavored oyster and Chinatown Clam Casino are amazing. We also ordered their foie du jour for appetizer, the buttery texture melted perfectly on top of the strawberry crepe. Lastly, their dry-aged steak completely blew our mind, it comes with multiple creamy banchas on the side as well (be sure to wear loose clothing to fit all the food in your tummy)!    Definitely coming back here to try rest of their menu for my next and next next Vegas trips!!",

Very unique looking food and our bartender suggested it was French fusion inspired. We had the oyster trio, steak tartare, duck dumplings, lasagna, and the chocolate dessert. The plates are made to share and my partner spent $111 before tip. All the food I just mentioned and two drinks. The vibe in there is dark and had a beautiful wood log wall. I loved the bar seating area which is where we sat. They also had an en elegant cocktail menu. Craft cocktails that you would get on some fancy bar on the strip from a mixologist. It's great to even just meet for a drink. Highly recommended and we will be back to try the rest of the items on the menu. Like the porterhouse!",

If they would let me, I'd move my bed in and take over their rent. I love the gold chains with a library vibe and the Wolf mural above the bar. It's a cozy space without feeling crowded. It's always full.   My most recent visit had me at the bar devouring creamy corn and scallops. Their cocktails are stellar but if you're lucky enough to have a friend who frequents often and has a drink named after him - order it. I won't give away the name because it contains a Japanese whiskey that is known to be in low supply.   Seriously though. The food is stellar so kudos to the passion of Brian Howard there and John does a seamless job of running the front. The staff is fun and passionate. It's a real good time. Every time.",

    "text": "This is the second part of my review and discusses the entree only.  And now for our final dish, the entree, a 32  ounce Medium Rare-Dry Aged Porterhouse, that is in a league of its own and cannot be compared to any of the other dishes.   Unlike several restaurants through the valley that pride themselves on their steaks-that come out over cooked or some parts of the steak are over cooked wile other parts are indeed medium rare-every piece of this steak was medium rare and perfectly cooked from the middle to the ends. This speaks volumes in the skills and techniques to ensure that the equipment is evenly heating the beef while cooking it.  As briefly stated earlier, we did not see how a different piece of beef could be better than that Cauliflower NY Strip which I still talk about today. Also, this dish included several Korean style small dishes called Banchan, which when paired with the Porterhouse will take you on this journey that sadly concludes with the last bite of one of the most perfectly flavored and cooked steaks of your life. Personally the beets are the highlight of the banchan. I loved the mild heat that was incorporated with the natural flavor and sweetness of a beet.  While taking in the first bite you quickly realize just how tender the Porterhouse is. Just as quick, you begin to discover the miso flavor, and it feels as if your eating buttery meat that literally melts in your mouth. The way this Porterhouse house is prepared by itself makes this steak far superior to most of the steakhouses in the valley. the steak is perfect without the banchan. However, the banchan is such a nice accommodation and allows you to customize each bite that will take you on a journey, where the sole purpose is too not have a care in the world, lose yourself in its flavors, and eat good food. Eating this steak made us happy. What a journey it has been and we look forward to our next dining experience.",

It's good but the cheese over power the uni flavor. Maybe if they toss more uni (sea urchin) in between the the grill cheese than  just on top would make it better. The hamachi carpaccio is soooo good. Melt in your mouth.   The beef cheek bone marrow dumplings is one of their popular dishes but I thought it didn't wow me. It is good just not a wow. The hamachi Kama off the menu, special of the day is really good. Most places grill it fully cooked but this was cook medium just perfect for me. I thought it was the best hamachi Kama I have ever had.   The oysters are good and fresh but not wow. Their special cocktail drinks are ok. Service and Our waiter was super cool! John Anthony \"partner\" mention they will bring their yummy food to the Bay Area. I will definitely email him for updates on that. Not all the food was perfect but who is lol....overall it was pretty close to perfect for me. .I had a great time! So I give it top notch 5 Star!",

    "text": "Wow, I could not have asked for a better spot to take my Vegas food virginity.   We left the menu in the chef's hands, and course after course, the creativity and flavors kept hitting the right spots.  We opted for the chef's choice tasting - if you don't see it on the menu, definitely ask! The dishes were a selection of current menu items, plus few unlisted courses. We ended up with 12 (generous) dishes for our party of 3.   Some highlights:   Charcuterie Plate - They make most of the charcuterie in-house, and it was noticeably better than your standard charcuterie. The pickled persimmon was also unexpected but amazing.  Caviar Bump - Yes, you read that right. This was literally a gigantic bump of caviar on my hand. Hilarious and amazing.  Maitake Mushrooms - Apparently I have a thing for food that looks like an autumn forest floor - I loved the woodsy presentation. The layers of sunchoke, chili, hummus, and mushroom created a pleasing variety of flavor and texture.  Spanish Octopus - I hesitate to say anything is the best, but this beat out my previous favorite (Evvia in Palo Alto) for the best octopus I've tried. The tenderness made me weak.   American Wagyu, Duck Breast, Foie Gras -  All three of these ingredients I'm particular about. Wagyu is often overcooked or under seasoned. Duck breast is usually gamey and/or too chewy for me. And I'm not a fan of most foie - I've only truly loved the taste one other time. Sparrow + Wolf pulled off all three on the same plate, and I loved every freaking bite.  Chocolate Caramel Tart - The plating for the whole meal was awesome, but this was especially stand out. The chocolate was decadent and not too sweet, the vanilla ice cream lightened the dish, and the cocoa nibs added nice texture contrast. A perfect ending.  Wine pairings - The sommelier and FOH manager John picked a fun mix of whites and reds. I liked that he switched it up and paired a white for the meat course. The Locations CA White was my favorite - oaky like a typical California chard, but also uniquely crisp at the same time due to the blend of chardonnay, sauv blanc, viognier, and roussan. I've never had a white quite like it.  I came with a VIP regular, so the service was especially great. The staff was full of passion and everyone seemed like they truly enjoy working there. Chef Brian Howard came out a number of times to describe the dishes. We also had a new server, but she already seemed seasoned.  Bookmark this off strip spot! Sparrow + Wolf checked off all the boxes and more - food, style, service, creativity, ambiance.",

Had some time to kill before flight home so decided to do the tasting menu. Love the Asian flavors mixed into everything. My highlights include seafood hodgepodge soup-mousse thingy (smoked trout roe and uni in a celery root base), octopus confit, duck sweet potato dumplings, scallops on daikon, clam casino, steak tar tar, hamachi, honey toast with anise ice cream, and some sort of fruity-savory foie gras with pineapple.  Everything was awesome!  I am so stuffed!  Such a great place to come off strip and non-pretentious. My server Christopher was great and had some valuable input.  Better than many SF restaurants I've been to that were triple the price.  I am definitely coming again when I come back to Las Vegas.",

Everything was so good. The waitress gave us some great pointers on what to order. We started with the ocean parfait. I don't even know how someone comes up with that combination. The seaweed powder and the crispy rice balls along with the trout roe and uni was ridiculous. Beef check and bone marrow dumplings, crazy combination that was just visually stunning and tasty. Pretty much a shredded beef dumpling, but definitely elevated. Hard to decide what was best though, the foie gras, or the steak. The foie gras was perfectly seared with that meat butter taste and a great sauce.  The steak could have been the whole meal. It was a big steak that was perfectly cooked and cut in to strips, served banchan style with a bunch of small dishes. It came with a chimichurri sauce that was packed with flavor. All of the different small dishes were also really good, the mushrooms and the carrots were probably my fav. Definitely a must if you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Please be advised: food portions are designed for sparrows, and no reservation = second class citizen service & treatment from staff.    normally don't write reviews for restaurants, but I am compelled to share this absolutely disastrous dining experience. A couple months back, I decided to try out what I thought would be a trendy new place with 3 friends. It was a Friday night, and we walked in around 6pm. Hostess tells us it would be around a 20 minute wait. 20 turned into 40, and 40 into an hour. Each time we checked back with them, we were teased along and told \"it's a busy night, really hard to predict just when a spot will open up but it shouldn't be more than another 10-15 minutes\". Granted, the dining floor is on the smaller size (capacity maybe 20). By that point, we should have just left but we were determined to stick it out since we already invested an hour. How much longer could it be?   After 2.5 hours, the staff finally told us we could be seated. A total of 3 HOURS elapsed since we arrived before we finally got seated. Safe to say, me & co were quite a bit hangry by then, so I flagged down the manager to ask if we could receive any sort of compensation for the unexpectedly long wait. Their dishes come tapa-sized, enough to feed a sparrow and we were all still hungry after eating our food. For most adults, it would take least $50/head to get full from an empty stomach. Manager offered us a round of drinks on the house, but snarked that we should have known better than to drop in on a busy night without a reservation and not-so-subtly told us it was our own fault. What the actual f***?! Rest of the service felt like our waiter was rushing to get us out of the restaurant as quickly as possible. Will not be returning ever again!! They should change their name to SORROW AND WOLF PISS",

The sommelier suggested a really good dark French wine, which went really well with the Duck Dumplings and the lamb. Dessert was amazing, especially the Pavlova, which gave you amazing flavors. It was bitter at first bite, then you taste the sweet and then the sour. Very clever dessert, I would definitely recommend it. The Honey Toast is just amazing, I loved it!   We got an excellent table, it was inside a small room where the wine was kept, with the books. I'm glad we got a four-seater table and not a small table where you get cramped up with your food. Interiors were beautiful, the cook books that were on the shelves made it even more interesting.  Overall a good dining experience, we would definitely come back and recommend it to everyone.",

A lot of love and passion went in to creating everything here and I can appreciate all the hard work. I like that everything on the menu is designed for you to try something \"new\". The plates are small but you can get full quick. Fair pricing and vegetarian friendly. Cheese plate was excellent served with honey & homemade, pickled vegetables. Love the creative cocktail menu and the service is the best in town. Manager is going table to table wanting the best experience for every customer. The only thing I was left wanting was more textures on my plate. I felt soft came with soft and vice versa. Scored me a free glass of wine with a yelp check in! Was to full to try dessert but will next time as I would love to revisit.",

Each of us started with something from the menu but then asked the bartender for her own creations, which were amazing.  For food we started with the Bento Box and then followed with a 32oz porterhouse.  One of the best dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas.  Definitely worth the cab ride off the strip.",

I didn't like the duck, our server saw that I didn't eat it, she offered to change it to my liking. Now that's an awesome service. I've been to places where the chef gets mad at you when you don't eat their plate. This restaurant is different. Everyone was friendly and made sure that you are enjoying your time. I also greatly appreciate the happy anniversary dessert they gave us. Will definitely recommend to all my family and friends. Can't wait to come back here.",

The lamb neck was absolutely amazing!!! Big enough to split between two people. It was very tender and was paired well with the \"pancake\" and fruit.

However, it was a disappointment.   First of all, when I called to make the reservation, I was not treated rudely but I felt like I wasn't very welcome either. I was not being thank for for making a reservation and not even a bye before being hung up on the phone. He already hung up the phone while I was saying, \"Thank you and bye.\" Whoa...  Second of all, many of the items on the menu were not available and it was all the ones the reason we decided to come here. Then we were also informed later on that the whole menu got changed at the beginning of the year.   Third, staffs are nice but super slow service.   Fourth, the food were just an ok. The uni clam ($7.50 for one...lol) was salty. The uni melt was ok but the uni was a little fishy. The hamachi poke was good. The lamb neckbone was ok, it was way too oily and none of us liked the sauce. The drinks were ok, nothing impressive since the ones we wanted were no longer on the menu. Then there's something called sweet bread, boy how it tricked us, it was pig liver. And yes, just tasted like liver. Um, no.   We were just glad we didn't order that much for a group of 8. The bill still came out to be over $200 while all of the dish was small, only the lambneck looked like a main entree. My bf said this place should call Tapas.   An extra star is for the ok nice decor.   Now we are off for some oxtail soup for this cold weather.",

Ordered an eggplant dish along with some grilled broccolini with ingredients I couldnt necessarily pronounce or remember but tasted great! The porterhouse steak which came with so many little sides and sauces with the order was excellent and well priced....size was enough to serve 2 to 3 ppl.

    "text": "Sparrow + Wolf offers a selection of entrees of American dishes modernized to match the trendy and hip atmosphere of which you'll be dining in.   Offerings include fresh oysters with various options and specials to determine how they're prepared, beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings, and duck with delicious foie gras prepared on top.  We arrived around 6pm without reservations and were still seated promptly.  I can only imagine that as the popularity of this restaurant rises, a reservation might be a good idea if you want a seat.  First to try, an order of their \"hearth baked bread with cultured butter\".  While I can understand   the concept of selling bread instead of serving it complimentary for an upscale trendy establishment, I felt the rolls were on the small side and did not particularly stand out by any means taste-wise.  I'd save the dough (see what I did there?) and use that towards any of their fantastic appetizers and entrees.  The beef cheek and bone marrow dumplings with green onion emulsion, garlic foam was pretty delicious and shareable with another person.   It was weird because at this point, we were offered complimentary toasted bread to scoop up the sauce to enjoy all its tastefulness.  The bread itself was burnt though.  My wife ordered beef skewers which were paired with crepes, butter, and chickpea relish.  Slightly undercooked per my wife's taste with lots of red on the inside of each piece of skewered meat.  It also came out somewhere between cold and warm, probably sitting on a plate for some time before being served to us.  My duck entree was definitely the star.   The flavors were on point and the foie gras elevated the dish even further.   This was their saving grace for me.  Overall, a nice establishment with a great selection of appetizers and entrees but lacked a bit as far as execution goes.   We would have preferred our meats hot and our bread not burnt.",

    "text": "Where do I begin? Let's start online. Booking my reservation here, could not have been easier. Confirmation was sent and my reservation was in. No problem. I received numerous text alerts about my reservation through the weeks of waiting to attend my 40th birthday and my beautiful girlfriend, Danelle's birthday.  Telling her young age is not appropriate, so we will not do that )).  When we arrived at the restaurant,  we were immediately greeted and seated. The restaurant is very warm and pleasing. Romance can easily be sparked here, due to its comfortable, chic atmosphere. We were sat at a 2 top table next to this chain wall, very classy. I had to touch it, sorry, but it is real!  The waitress immediately came to our table, along with the server assistant with water shortly after. She greeted me with my name and wishes us a Happy Birthday. POINTS for that for sure.  She told us the specials and then gave us the opportunity to decide upon ourselves.  When she returned we ordered cocktails and our food.  Danelle had a Easy Peasy, yum yum, and I had an Ichigo Time, yummy as well.   The manager, John Anthony, was so polite and generous. He gave us a glass of champagne for our birthdays and showed his True appreciation for our birthday celebration,  Thank You!!  The drinks came very promptly, and then the fun really began. They started us .........oh wait......We decided for our food to be decided by the Chef, Brian Howard. The Chefs Tasting Menu is the most amazing experience we ever have had.  Okay.......they started us with a wonderful freshly roasted bread that had a butter to die for. The inside of the bread was so soft and moist and the outside had a wonderful crunch.  As we enjoyed our bread, we felt this was going to be special.  Our first course brought to us was Beef Tartar. I personally never had it until that night. The taste was exquisite. The different spices and Asian influence were unbelievable.  We ate it all. Couldn't help ourselves. Next we had, forgive me I forget the name, but not the flavor, a tomato dish. It was very light and refreshing. Himachi Carpaccio was the next course. Can I say WOW!! And HOW!! As you observe the delicate placement of the flowers and grapes on top of this beautiful plate of Himachi. As you eat it your senses begin to tingle. You lips and tongue will grow slightly numb and it feels very euphoric.  It was quite the experience. For our next course we had Beef Cheek and Bonemarrow Dumplings. As everything before this was a preparation for a heavy dumpling. Heavy in a good way for sure! Almost like a wo derful homecooked beef stew in a dumpling. This was straight to the soul delicious! As we were enjoying the Carpaccio, Chef Brian came to greet us. We were floored. Never in my 22 years as an adult, have I had the Chef come to my table to greet us. I was pleasantly surprised as was Danelle.  He wished us Happy Birthday and started describing our next course. Beef Shortrib with a Flintstone bone! We were like, OMG, that sounds so delicious. Then he hand delivered it to our table and returned again to ask us how we were doing.  Let me just say, NO KNIFE NEEDED! The meat was so succulant and was easily torn from the large slab of meat, made for MAN, to devour. I ate about 4 oz. of that alone. We had to box that to go. Next we were brought a beautiful chocolate care to share. They wrote Happy Birthday on the plate and it too was unreal good! When we finished we wanted a picture with the amazing crew who made this all possible. They obliged with open arms, and a smile. Never in my life have I been treated so warmly, by strangers. You made this an experience of a lifetime. Thank you to everybody at Sparrow and Wolf! You guys really are awesome!!!!  PS...sorry I missed the Broccoli Rob we had as well. It too was delicious and the smokiness from the open fire was very good with the Avocado. Yummy",

The turkey was moist, and the endive salad was delicious. The Brussel sprouts were too sweet and burnt. The fried chicken was tough as hell. The deviled egg was too creamy and underseasoned. And most people don't like pumpkin pie. The flavors were bland, even though all the dishes sounded so interesting from the descriptions. The cocktails were over sweet and I couldn't even finish mine. I was so happy I found a place open for Thanksgiving. If only my meal could have been as nice as the decor.",

    "text": "Pardon my French but F*** Me!  Coup de foudre.  This is what happens when you let a chef play.  Brainchild of Chef Brian Howard of Comme Ca Vegas, this new eatery is a stunner.  Global cusine with a nod ot Asia. (possibly owing to it's Chinatown location).  Dishes are bold and rich offset with herbs, sprouts, flowers, and greens.   Beautiful plates of playful food that won't tire your palate.  The perfect expression of this, the outstanding sweetbreads.  Crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside, nice offal flavors.  Along side, bacon wrapped baby romaine lettuce, an interesting foil, that makes no sense until you combine it with the sweet peas and vegetal, raw pea tendrils and herbs; a great way to add brightness to the dish.  Bacon fat plays a role in the sauce bringing the dish together.  Artichoke, a take on the roasted artichokes of the Jewish quarter of Rome, excellent.  Bitter, crisp, creamy all at the same time.  It's flavor elevated by the white bean hummus, charred tomatillos, peppery wilted arugula, and pine nuts and a dousing of olive oil.    The beef cheek and bone marrow dumpling showcases tender beef cheeks enriched by melting bone marrow.  The wrap, relatively thick and cooked al dente, bordering on being too chewy but holds everything in.  The peppery beef perfectly matches the green onion emulsion but the use of foam; sorry I always think of cat spit, not appealing.  It's just me.  THE showstopper, albeit it inconsistent, the \"campfire duck\".  Holy $hit!  Beautifully rendered fat (almost no white under the skin), perfect mid rare, topped with a melting, pan seared thick slice of foie sprinkled with a few crystals of rock salt that adds burst of texture and flavor.  The whole thing sits on earthy, wood ear mushroom slivers and briny Japanese cucumber pickles (what you'd find in a bento). An Asian inspired, sweet sour plum and duck jus ties it together.  Sublime.  Sadly the fat of a duck breast from a second order (placed later in the meal) was so poorly rendered, disappointing.   The head on Argentinean red shrimp (creamy head fat with lime butter; just saying) and culatello both delish.  If that's not enough, get the hearth baked bread.  A True European style bread with great texture, perfect for mopping up any savory juices that remain on any dish.  Creative craft cocktails.  Well chosen wine list with very reasonable, off Strip pricing.  Check out their FB for promotions and specials.  HH from 5:30 - 6:30.  Addendum:  Be sure to check out Burger Night (Thursday - Saturday 11PM - close).  Great blend of cuts, cooked to temp, topped with burata and arugula plus a COEDO black lager for $20; steal!   Friendly, knowledgeable, local service.    A chef's playground of a restaurant.  And it's outstanding.",

I can't properly express how happy I was with each bite that I took. Every dish, every drink, every course--it was phenomenal. I'll be coming back next time I'm in Vegas.  Our server, Brittany, was knowledgeable, and totally accommodating with my obscure culinary questions.

The nicely seared scallop dish has a nice smoke flavor that I enjoyed. The big ass pork shank is enough for one major appetite or easily shared for two not so starving people. The slow roasted fall off the bone pork amazed. Strangely enough I didn't think the accompanying sauce was necessary and preferred the pork solo. The  mushroom/hummus dish was a delightful surprise and a rewarding menu choice. Don't sleep on the house made bread. It's part of the appetizer menu and the warm sourdough had the prefect hint of \"light sour\" bread with an amazing texture crunch and chew. The honey toast is a perfect dessert a nod to the  Asian version but with their own twist.  Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere, thoughtfully executed menu and can't wait to come back.   Service: The primary server was just ok, had it not been for the interaction with the owner/GM I rate it a 5 out of 10. The owner/gm has charisma and enthusiasm that really adds to the overall dining experience 9 of 10. The staff will eventually match their gm's great level of service so go give them a try.",

We started with a tasty mushroom dish served over hummus, then we shared the \"big ass pork\" and campfire duck.  We also got the hearth bread.   The mushroom dish was the tastiest. Super flavorful! Highly recommend.  Hubby loved the pork. I will always order duck if it's on a menu...bonus points for grilled fois gras on top!  The duck breast was a little too fatty for my liking...prefer the fat rendered a bit more. But the fois gras was good!  Two main courses, an app and bread was just enough food for the two of us. Pricing was about $9 on the low end glasses of wine and $13 for cocktails. Apps (or lighter courses I think they call them) were in the teens, the two mains we got were mid $30s. Not as high as the strip and definitely on par with a place trying to be trendy like this. I would come back for happy hour (if offered, I didn't check) or date night if we felt like American food (we almost always seek out Asian food tho). Next time I will try the octopus!",

    "text": "This is our favourite restaurant in the Las Vegas area.  It's off the strip, but defending mutely worth an Uber. Service was fantastic; attentive but unobtrusive.  And the food was outstanding.  This is Asian fusion that bears no resemblance to the typical all you can eat variety. Portions were sized right for us.  It's pricy, and in my mind worth every penny.",

Order a few plates to try and share- every bite is full of flavor, even the vegetable based dishes. Bring a date, a best friend, go alone- you and any guests will be so happy you did.",

Top it off with really poor timing on delivery of our food.  After our appetizers we waited another 45 minutes for our main course.  The food was tasty but the service was horrendous!!",

My boyfriend and I  ordered the Bread with fresh butter appetizer (I forgot it's official name) Bento Box, Beef Cheek Dumplings and Caviar Pizza... I think I just about died and went to heaven. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and I can't say it enough, their food is out of this world!!! The only negative is that the restaurant gets pretty loud...but who has time to talk when you're busy enjoying each bite?! If you haven't been here, you MUST go!",

We arrived and Brian, the Chef/Owner, greeted us and I informed him this was a birthday celebration. We were seated and the entire party was treated to a specialty drink on the house for my birthday.  Very nice and a great gesture. Perfect way to get the night going. Thank you, Brian. We had the Bone Marrow, Japanese Sweet Potato, Lamb Lasagna, Beet Tartar, Brussel Sprouts, Lamb Neck, Mitake Mushrroms w/ hummus and the trio of desserts.  Everything was FANTASTIC!! Best Brussel Sprouts we've ever had! Thank you Brian and team for a very memorable evening!",
