However, my first experience was unfortunately not excellent. I ordered the papaya salad with shrimp, decent price at under $10. However, woman asked me how spicy I wanted it, on a scale of 1-10. I don't know if she meant a scale of 1-5, or if it is just the spiciness of Thai food, but I asked for a 4 (thinking I was asking for mild) and what I received was just about too spicy to eat. Beware of this happening to you, always order down in spiciness and ask for hot sauce on the side maybe.",

The fact that they are 24/7 is obviously a major plus. So I ordered delivery for the first time yesterday, I got a noodle soup and panang curry. The estimated time was 45-1hr, but it got to my house in 30 mins. So I told my boyfriend about the place and he wanted to order delivery tonight, and we did. This time we got crab ragoon, pot stickers, duck red curry, pad see ew, and basil fried fried rice. Same estimated time and it still got here in 30 mins! We also got free veggie egg rolls as a bonus (I guess after a certain amount you spend they throw that in). And to add everything was amazing!!! Food is seriously so good, nothing was too oily. So happy about this place definitely going to be ordering more. Keep it up Thai pepper!!! Xoxo",

I had the Garlic Pepper Chicken and he had the Mongolian Beef, and both were excellent! We also ordered some Chicken Fried Rice, which was pretty decent once you mixed it up with the sauces that came with each of the entrees. I asked for my food to be as spicy as they could make it, and I found that it was still pretty mild, though tasty.   Our combo meals included Vegetable Soup and Veggie Egg Rolls, but we passed on both since neither of us are huge fans of either of those items. Not a bad deal at all for $5.95 each!",

    "text": "I came for a business meeting, which justified assuaging my curiosity regarding the place since I pass it quite often. I had high hopes; I started with thai iced coffee that was dark, flavorful and sweet, but things deteriorated from there.   Once all of us had placed our orders, the food came out in odd segments. Two people were served while the other two sat and waited awkwardly. Those who had food didn't want to dig in and be rude, so they sat and waited with us for 5-10 minutes. We were given one large rice bowl for four people, which was quickly doused in curry sauce.   We sampled the papaya salad, which was decent. A fair portion for $5-6 bucks, but nothing to do a jig of joy over.  I ordered the roast duck curry. There were a few pieces of duck swimming in the sauce, but it seemed that it was mostly skin/fatty bits and a few pieces of vegetable. At $7-8 it's not horridly expensive, but it's not a generous serving of protein OR vegetables; it's just a whole lot of sauce.   Halfway through the meal, one girl found a large cork-screw shaped piece of metal in her food. It didn't cut her mouth, but was alarming nonetheless.   Risk of ingesting metal with little other filler? Meh. I'd rather go down the street, there are far better finds in Vegas. Too bad.",

    "text": "I don't typically take the time to write reviews, but we haven't even finished our glorious meal yet, and I had to stop to come give this place my highest praise. My fiance and I are staying at the Rio, and I came across this restaurant while looking for nearby delivery options in a modest price range. We're on a tight budget whilst in the middle of a mega cross country move, and we decided to splurge from our tent camping standard to get a hotel room in Vegas to treat ourselves for a few nights. Cheap, good, and bountiful meals are harder to come by than they once were in Sin City, and we can't really afford to drop a hefty sum at one of the many restaurant options here in the Rio.   After deliberating between a few Thai options offering delivery in the vicinity (conveniently browsable and comparable thanks to Yelp's awesome Eat24 service), I settled on Thai Pepper due to a combination of its good reviews, reasonable prices, and the ultimate seller for me of a few coupon offers (one per order allowed) for various free dishes with certain dollar amounts purchased. (I especially loved the review from a man who described how he and his then fiancee stumbled upon this spot one late night by happenstance and loved it so much they had their wedding reception there. Knowing that you're supporting good, honest, caring people who kindly go the extra mile for their customers makes it that much better.)  We love curry, so we ordered one of each available- green, yellow, red, and panang. We also ordered a Thai iced tea (absolutely divine) and some fruits on ice (Which we haven't delved into yet but are excited about! My fiance was impressed with the portion size for the price as well.). We instantly regretted ordering only one iced tea. My fiance is currently suggesting we order 4 more this very moment. I think this might be the best Thai iced tea I've ever had. Seriously- don't order just one. They are pure perfection. Lastly, we received a free chicken fried rice (via online coupon) with our order. We have sampled all of the dishes so far, and we're in love! My fiance did various Asian style cooking at his last job, including curries and fried rice, so he can be fickle about these dishes when we eat out if they aren't done well. He absolutely approves, and we both recommend all of these dishes whole heartedly! We were also pleased with the spice levels, and appreciated the additional inclusion of side containers of chili sauce. The heat at Thai Pepper is True to the spice level you request, and the flavors of the curries are wonderful.  It took about a half hour to receive our order, delivered to the hotel lobby for us by a very nice, friendly, and polite man who called as soon as he got to the lobby to let us know he was there. We received everything we could need with our order, too- chopsticks, forks, spoons, napkins, straws, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and chili sauce.  If you are in the area and enjoy Thai food, and especially if you're looking for great delivery (available late night, too!), definitely try Thai Pepper. The curries and the Thai iced tea are particularly wonderful, and the service is fast and courteous!",

Obviously, this only means something to anyone who can benefit from said delivery, but that's kind of a big deal for a vegan who literally has NO other delivery options. (Komol claims they deliver, but they don't.)  Lots of vegan and vegetarian options, or things that can be modified.  We had a green curry, tofu nam sod, pad kee mao, and pad woo sen.  Everything was perfectly fine, but not the best in the 'hood.    We will definitely be ordering from this place again when we are too lazy or too drunk to pick up from Komol!",

I was lured in by Thai Pepper's lunch specials and dragged my husband in, who was against coming in period (he said he had bad vibes about the place). Bad vibes be damned because I wanted a Thai lunch special for under $10!  Walking in, the place was decently packed and was staffed by only waiter. The waiter immediately seated us but then cautioned, \"We're really busy right now so it might be a little while\". Uh oh. I have a Con to get to, man! Right about now is when we realized that is was uncomfortably warm in the restaurant. I look at the thermostat - 82 degrees. Not the business.   10 minutes go by. The waiter drops off waters and takes off in a hurry. Btw, the water tasted really bad. Another 10 minutes go by. I start getting antsy and my husband is glaring at me because he's hangry. We realize it's going to take FOREVER (in the Sandlot voice) to get our food and get outta there. We decided to leave and go elsewhere because time is precious. I felt bad for leaving while the waiter sadly watched us walk out, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  Worth a return visit? Probably not. Don't come here for lunch if you're on a tight schedule!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #99",

We did end up eating the left overs at 5pm, and the green curry got even more tasty with the flavors infusing in with time.

    "text": "This place is the actual worst place I have ever ordered food from. I ordered food at about 10:30 pm one night.  It got here by around 11:30 pm. I don't eat anything spicy so I order all of my food at a spice level 0. Our food got here and I was the last to start eating my food. When I took a bite it was super spicy my boyfriend tried it because he knows how I'm a baby about spice and it was even spicy to him. I thought \"no big deal I'll call and get it fixed\". I called the guy told me that it was my fault that it was spicy because \"all curry has to be made spicy\". Now i understand that some places have curry that is spicy and they can't change that. Which is why I asked the lady who took my order if the curry i wanted to order was spicy. She said \"no it is the same as everything else. You can order it 0-10\". So when the guy told me that it had to be spicy i told him what the lady told me. He told me ALL curry is spicy no matter what. (Which is 100% not True, i eat curry all the time. It's not all spicy all the time). So eventually he decided to tell me to order something else, and they would bring me my new order and take the curry. That was weird, but whatever. So I tell him I wanted Pad Thai. The curry I got was $12.95 and the Pad Thai was $7.95. He told me he would give me extra chicken because of the price difference. I was really confused and asked if he was going to refund me the price difference. He told me no,  because they only refund if there is something wrong with the food. He refused to accept that being lied to about the food not being spicy was something wrong but he would not accept that. So he tried telling me that he would just give me more chicken. And even if he was planning on putting a pound of chicken in there that was not acceptable. So since he told me he was not going to be refunding my money i told him to tell me what on the menu was the same price as the curry i had ordered. He kept telling me the boodle dishes which i had to keep reminding him were only $7.95 not $12.95 The only thing on the menu that is $12.95 is curry. I asked to speak to the manager. How convenient manager isn't there. Ok, well let me talk to whoever is in charge. He tells me no one is in charge. That made no sense. So then i decide i want him to just give me my money back. He can have the curry i don't want it. At this point i have wasted an hour or more and I'm starving. He argued with me more telling me he was definitely not going to refund my money. So i asked when the manager was going to be in. He told me he didn't know and to call tomorrow. I asked if i call tomorrow and all for the manager will he just tell me the manager isn't in again... he actually said \"yes\" i asked again to clarify whati had just heard i said \"so if i call tomorrow and your manager is in and you know it is me calling you will tell me the manager is not in? \" he said \"yes, exactly\". So i told him to come get the food and my money needed to be back in my account tomorrow or i would be down there to speak with whoever was in charge. He eventually agreed to this, and then never came to get the food! I called another thia place ordered curry, clarified that it would not be spicy, got my food and enjoyed my level 0 spice curry. I will never order from this place again,  that man is awful and so is the lady that took my order.",

Well, not only did they mix up my order, but when I drove all the way back to pick up the correct order, the dish turned out like crap. Not sure if they were punishing me because I expressed my displeasure with the mix up in my order, but this isn't how they usually make the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. And if they do make it this way going forward, what a fail! So disappointed because I am losing a restaurant that is so conveniently near my home and work. The only thing good from this experience was the nice lady. But nice does not supersede bad crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. Not coming back for awhile!!! Ugh!",

They're in a strip mall an easy walk from SLS and its nothing fancy, just a little local place with awesome food. Go elsewhere if you want to pay $50 for atmosphere, come here if you want an enjoyable low key lunch. I'll be back for sure.",

I tend to go for the Lunch Specials from 11-3 where there have many, many options for $5.95. The lunch specials include the indicated entree, soup, rice, salad and an egg roll.   The egg rolls are my favorite appetizer and fried to perfection, the sauce has the right amount of sweetness. The salad tends to change between ice berg lettuce to spinach greens but the dressing is prime and some carrot slices are added to the mix.   As for the menu options I tend to go for the Mongolian beef, a classic, that comes with your option of spice level and quite a bit of onions. I recently tried the BBQ pork which was different than many other types I've had. It came with a orange glaze sauce which was tasty but a little on the sweet side. Out of the two, I prefer the Mongolian Beef.",

They keep the lights down so it's calm and romantic, it feels very homey inside. It's been very busy both times but we've been able to have a seat right away. They have a lot of delivery orders going out the door and phone calls for more but they still managed to get all of our food out in a timely matter, too.   All the servers are very fast-paced and take care of everything you need right away. The first time we were there, they even had a live singer who was quite talented!   We've tried the Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Spicy Thai Basil Chicken, Beef Salad, Papaya Salad, Mango Sticky Rice, Crispy Chicken Wings, & their Pad Kee Mao.   All of it is amazing! I highly recommend their spicy Thai basil chicken dish, it is so so so so SO good! Also! Their mango sticky rice is perfect & papaya salad tastes super fresh! Yum yum yum!",

They tried to sit us right next to the front door where people were coming in and out. It was 33 degrees outside, and it was extremely cold in the restaurant. They even had the ceiling fan on! We asked to sit away from the front door. They brought us 2 waters (not 3). We waited and waited and waited, but they never came to take our order. We had to go walk up to the waiter and give them our order. Even once our 3rd guest arrived, they never brought her a water. We had to again go up to the front of the restaurant and ask for them a water. When our entrees arrived, there was barely any meat or vegetables in them. Instead, they used onion as fillers. Seems like they were trying to save money. They never brought my side of brown rice. I had to, again, go up to the kitchen and ask for it. When they did finally bring it, it was a watery, gushy mess and tasted terrible. They never brought our check. We had to go up to the cashier and wait for her to write out a ticket.  We will NEVER go here again.",

    "text": "Reasonable asian food, but the real highlight is they are open 24/7. The menu is mostly Thai, but they have a selection of American style Chinese items as well.   The Thai Sausage and Thai Dumplings are nice.  The mango sticky rice was also very nice.  The pot stickers were deep fried, even though I checked the \"steamed\" check box on my online order. One of the best things about potstickers is the slightly gummy pastry when boiled or steamed. Even if you pan fry them after you steam them, they still have that great gummy taste on the top. When you deep fry them they turn to leather, the potsticker equivalent of beef jerky. Sure they cook faster when you deep fry them, but I like deep fried pot stickers about as much as I would like deep fried Spaghetti Bolognese.  The duck fried rice had two pieces of duck. I could have been happy with the rather modest protein portion if they had taken the time to dice the duck into a few more pieces, but it was clear they had allocated less than two seconds of time to cutting up the pre-roasted duck for this dish. If they had just allocated 40 seconds and cut the roasted duck into 10 to 15 chopstick friendly little pieces, I would have been a happy camper.  The wontons in the wonton soup were too floury for my taste, the pastry was were either too thick or they were cooked/soaked too long. Takeout wonton soup is always better if they ship it without the soup and you assemble it when you get it. They did not do that here.",

My BF ordered the Panang curry & I ordered my usual of pad Thai (although I now wish I ordered papaya salad too!). I honestly think the Panang curry was better! The pad Thai was definitely good, but didn't live up to par with other places around Vegas.   The one GREAT thing about this place though is that it is 24/7 (don't quote me on the 7 days part), so if you are hungry late at night for some Thai...well, hi there. You just found a place.

They stay open very late so its a good pit stop for michies or delivery.   For some odd reason they have karaoke late at night but it doesn't look fun or inviting. Unlike some other divey places in Vegas this place lacks any charm, perhaps because the servers are so unfriendly and cold. Everytime i go in there the young Asian-American kids that work there are so bland and it hilarious how cartoonishly millennial they act, but in a bad way.",

For Thai Pepper's delivery I had to go to the lobby to meet the delivery guy, but that was better than eating in the restaurant options downstairs, esp. after a day of LVCC exhibition and work stuff.  My tom yum soup $8 and cat fish red curry with rice $13 was pretty spicy - despite ordering Medium - so if you like it cooler order accordingly. The flavor was very tasty and not too salty unlike so many other food joints. There was plenty of sauce to soak into the white rice. If my room had a fridge and microwave I'd have it again tomorrow as this order was enough for two people!  The delivery guy was friendly. My only complaint was that no one mentioned the $5 delivery charge on the phone (it is on the menu that comes with your order.) Oh, and the plastic cutlery was really crap and bends when eating the hot food.  P.S. I think Nancy H.'s review looks like a fake one.",

My order was delivered in a decent amount of time, and the food was interesting too. I tried the Crispy Orange Chicken with Broccoli and a side order of Cream Cheese Wontons. It wasn't the traditional type of sweet syrupy orange chicken (similar to the kind served at most Chinese take-out restaurants). Uniquely, it had a very crunchy, bland taste, but with the extra orange sauce served on the side, it was flavorful. The side order of cream cheese wontons were also tasty.   In the future, I think I may try another menu item, with a little more spice, like the Spicy Pad-Thai. This place is great for late night cravings.",

Turns out when I called to place my delivery order around 12:30pm that day, they never even charged my card until 2:21pm (I have the receipt to prove it), so no wonder it took so longer.  THEY NEVER EVEN PROCESSED MY ORDER! When I called multiple times to ask where the food was, they kept telling me \"it's on it's way\".  So, how can my food be on it's way at 1:30pm, 1:45pm, 2:00pm and 2:15pm with a receipt that's be ran at 2:21pm... So, here it goes again:  First, let me just say they their food is very tasty.  Their service however is really awful.  They lie about timing, and quite frankly it happens all of the time.  I've ordered from here multiple times and have always had to wait over an hour for food.  I understand it's a small business, but having to wait almost two hours for a delivery order is unacceptable. If you're running behind, call us! You ask for the number when we order so why not update your paying clients? Bye Thai Pepper, I'll be ordering from a different place from now on.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas from Pasadena CA for a friend's wedding Sept 2014, after the wedding, clubbing and a couple of drinks at 1:00 am I was hungry again. No buffet open at 1:00 am, no restaurants open nearby and tired as you can imagine. I told my fiance (wife now) I guess the only choice within walking distance is that McDonalds over there and with such disappointment she agree, as we got closer to McDonalds we noticed a sign that says Thai Food and with an open sign on the window so we quickly change our mind not knowing what to expect but we thought anything will be better than McDonalds that's for sure.  So we order and first thing we noticed was the portions are big but then to our surprise the food tasted even better. Three months earlier in June 2014 we started planning our wedding after 8 years as a couple, two kids and with my fiance catching the toss of the bouquet at our friend's wedding we needed to set a date quickly. We knew we were getting married anyways but no date was set yet then.  As we ate our meal wife and I (fiance then) started talking about making Thai Pepper Restaurant our choice for our dinner reception which was planned for Dec. 2014, when we first visited they were remodeling the room adjacent to the main entrance but that didn't discourage us knowing that the meal we had was delicious. When we paid our check I approached Win at the cashier and asked information about having a dinner reception here and he was very attentive and showed me around and the room they were remodeling to hold events of this type and with that information we left convinced that this restaurant will end up been where we will have our dinner reception. Once a date for our wedding was set i contacted Win again to let him know of the date and approx. number of guests coming to our wedding, he was very attentive and dedicated to customer service we exchange numerous e-mails in the 3 month period to our wedding and with each one i sent he replied to every single one of my e-mails, very patient and courteous.  Fast forward 3 months later, our wedding, Fiance and I + 35 guests arrived into town, Win and his staff will go above and beyond to satisfy your needs and demands. They made the room very cozy, decorated it with roses and our clothed napkins shaped in different designs for each of our guests, they kept the newly remodeled event room neat for our dinner reception and the endless parade of non-stop food coming. I was so happy seeing all my guests happy faces and congratulating me for the choice of food and family felt cozy restaurant.  By the way we are a Hispanic couple with Hispanic guests, that's how good our meal was that we didn't even look back in search for a Hispanic food restaurant, we knew after our first meal that our guests will enjoy just as much as we did and that was exactly what happen.   They also treat us with live music and Karaoke throughout our dinner reception at no extra charge which at the end of the day we ended up taking over the mic and the karaoke set and started singing for our entertainment, glad they were so cool about it they step down from stage and just let us ran wild with our wild singing the rest of the night.   If you made it reading this far, you will learn from my experience that this restaurant and its staff are:   - very dedicated to you as a customer and your satisfaction   - No hidden fees, no charge for the event room. something most places charge on the strip.   - You only pay for what ends up making it to your stomach, your food. Period!  - If you love Thai Food, give it a try it will not disappoint you. I promise  - And most importantly you will end up saving around 70% of what you would normally spend anywhere on Strip. My bill was ($645.09) for 35 of our guests.  ***If you need a photographer, ask Win. I didn't have a photographer for our dinner reception and he saved our day. For a couple of $ he shot over 200 pictures with his camera and gave it all to us on a memory stick. I will post some of those pictures for you to see and to let the pictures do the rest of the talking for me and to back up my words on this review. Thanks again Win and all of your staff for making our dinner reception to our satisfaction, I'll come visit you soon again and to have another delicious dish of Thai food.  Our Order :  #1: Vegetarian Egg Rolls  x5 24.75 Del  #19: Crispy Squids  x5 44.75 Del  #20: Shrimp Tempura  x5 44.75 Del  #1: Papaya Salad  x5 34.75 Del  #3: House Salad  x5 39.75 Del  #2: Pad Se-Ew Noodle Chicken x5 39.75 Del  #5: Gai-Kua Rice Noodle **Shrimp($4.00) x5 59.75 Del  #11: Pineapple Fried Rice  x5 59.75 Del  #12: Combination Fried Rice  x5 64.75 Del  #1: Green Curry  **Shrimp($4.00) x5 59.75 Del  #3: Yellow Curry **Chicken($1.00) x5 44.75 Del  #1: Slice Beef Noodle Soup  x5 39.75 Del  #5: Chicken Noodle Soup  x5 39.75 Del",

I wanted to try the beef salad as I have never  eaten this type of Thai dish, its was light but filling. Please give Thai Pepper a try if you are in the Las Vegas area.

Having never been to this side of the strip, we decided to venture out and see what's around the hotel.  So lucky to find this have found Thai restaurant.  Ordered beef noodle, chicken yellow curry, and papaya salad.  All tasted very good  with large portions.  The price is down right cheap.  Other reviewers mentioned slow service, but we didn't experience that, maybe different time of day.    One thing to note, they ask you to rate the spiciness from 1-10.  I got a 3 for the papaya salad, it was already too spicy for me.  So be careful, always better to add later if you are not sure.",

Food was good, not amazingly good, good for the price and just okay taste wise. We ordered to go and picked up since delivery was going to be over an hour and we were starving already. We got the fish cakes, chicken pad thai, drunken noodles, shrimp Tom yum soup and papaya salad. We asian af so from an azn af point of view the food was decent. Pad thai was okay, a little bland so I put a good amount of hot sauce to make up for taste. Tom yum soups about average, fish cake average, drunken noodle okay. Basically everything was just okay tasting and mind u we azn af and hungry af and broke af after losing that night so that's why it was good lol. Oh we did find a small hair about 1 cm in the box with the fish cakes. Luckily it was on the cabbage, it was NOT curly (phew), and that was the only one we saw in the rest of the food. Next morning we went for lunch before we left vegas. Basil shrimp fried rice was slightly above average, chicken curry was slightly above average(sweat tasting), and Papaya salad was okay. Recommend if you got azn taste, are cheap azn trying save a dollar for your gambling addiction, want to chill in the hotel and eat, just want something to stop the hunger pains and cranky behavior that comes from starving and losing $$$$.  Best part was no diarrhea!   All joking aside, it's decent price wise, decent tasting, decent quality. Would like no hair in the food, please wear a hair net of some sort. I would eat here again next time I go to vegas.",

Found them on Yelp! midst early a.m. cravings after a long day. 3 orders of Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) and 45 minutes later, we're chowing down in our beds watching 48 hours and recapping adventures of the day.   *Critical note: they will ask you how spicy you want your food... and they'll ask you on a scale of 1-10. First time I've been asked in that way, but let me tell you something, that 9 aint no joke. Even the 6 was too spicy to enjoy. I usually love spicy food, but with this particular restaurant, go ahead and get it mild and it'll probably end up being juuuuuust right. I'd recommend like a 5 if you want it hot, and a 0 if you don't.  Also, they're unable to come up to your actual room at the SLS because you need to show your room key for elevator access. Still great service. I met him at the taxi line, swapped cash for food and we both went on our way.",

I ordered the roast duck curry (came with rice), sticky rice with mango and Thai iced tea to meet the $20 min for delivery.  Total bill including tip was $28.78.   Requested curry cooked extra spicy. Delicious and the serving was huge. An average person should request the spice level of 4 or 5.   Sticky rice and mango can be shared by 3 people. Delicious but the quality of the rice was inconsistent.   Delivered within 30 minutes, probably because everyone's still sleeping and hung over.",

For anyone who has ever been to the cc knows, it is essentially void of decent food options, unless you are into mass-produced pork sandwiches, fried chicken fingers, or faux barbecue.  Thai Pepper to the rescue!  My husband ordered for two families while sitting in the comfort of our hotel lobby bar.  He waited a mere 20 minutes for delivery, then walked all the food across the street to the convention center, where 4 hungry adolescent boys and 4 tired parents proceeded to inhale this oh-so-tasty food.  Dumplings!  Chicken Satay!  Curry!  Noodles!  All of it delicious, and at a much better price than any other restaurant in the neighborhood.  I highly reccommend Thai Pepper if you are looking for an inexpensive, tasty, quick food alternative to the concessionaires at the convention center.  (Next time, we'll plan ahead and see if they'll deliver directly to the convention center...can't hurt to ask!)",

I clicked to order the Tom Kha soup (the whole reason I ordered from there), but when I got the confirmation it listed it as the Kao-Low soup. I called immediately, because the Eat24 confirmation said I could call to correct the order, but they said it was already made. That's not even remotely possible, because I called within seconds ... and they never even asked the order number, so it's not possible for them to know if it had been made or not. It's so disappointing when bad customer service or apathetic receptionists result in disappointing experiences and bad reviews.",

The first night i went i ordered my usual, Pad Kee Mao, then two nights later I was craving rice, so i got the Thai shrimp fried rice.

So be careful if you can't handle spicy food.  A lot of parking too since it's inside a small plaza.  There's a weed dispensary few suites away so sometimes this area can be busy but still you won't have a hard time finding parking.  The Thai tea was good but on bit of a sweet side. Would be great if it's free refill tho. ^_^",

In a strip mall with a couple of fast food options... Ordered through the yelp app and the pricing was in line with other Thai food places... possibly just a little cheaper...  The app said it was going to be about 45 to 50 minutes for a pick up/takeout... I went ahead and called the restaurant to confirm that and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes so heads up yelpers!... If you do see a weird or lengthy time for takeout... I've been told by Restaurants to give a phone call to confirm...  I got there a couple of minutes early and was just waiting on the other half of my order... I ordered pad see ew w/ chicken and the chicken wings ...  The Pad was good but I would've preferred more noodles... I actually really like the noodles... The chicken was very tasty and tender... The chicken wings had a light almost tempura style batter which was really good... Came with a nice dipping sauce but I kind of just like the wings on their own... Very hearty and tasty...  While I was waiting in the small but comfortable restaurant area... Seemingly plenty of tables there is a back area where they had a DJ and it looks like they might do karaoke... It looked pretty fun back there...  I was greeted by one of the managers as well as the cashier and the order was ready and hot and the place smelled good... All in all I would say above average tie food... Great for takeout and made a delicious leftover meal the next day... Cool little spot great vibe and satisfactory thai food.",

I come to Vegas every year and have tried lots of Thai restaurants and I have found a lot of their food to be too sweet for my liking... yes even the curries and noodles.   Thai pepper however, is a lot less sweet and more similar to genuine Thai food from Thailand. In saying this, I only ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken (other restaurants make this too sweet), green curry and beef jerky. You can choose how spicy you would like it and the chef has hit medium right on the head. Everything I ordered was perfection, not to mention that I was quite shocked it was delivered so quickly. This will definitely be one of my regular go to places when I'm craving my late night Thai fix in Vegas (they are open 24/7). Great job Thai Pepper, you definitely came through.",

    "text": "Driving up to this Thai place I was very hesitant about the quality based on the strip mall it's located in. My staple dish at any Thai restaurant is pad thai which gives me a good reference dish. It was actually pretty good. It wasn't too dry or too greasy and had great flavor without being too spicy. And also the best part is the lunch special starts at 5.95 and includes an egg roll, soup and salad. It has awesome bang for your buck. I was completely full for 6 dollars. The yellow curry apparently is really yummy too. The server was attentive and got us in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour with 8 of us in our party.   So if you're on the strip and  can make it to Sahara and Paradise, you can get an awesome meal for an even better price.",

To make the minimum, I ordered a fried wonton appetizer and 2 lunch specials - Pad Thai & Mongolian beef. One for that day, the other for the next day's lunch.  The lunch specials come with a little side salad, egg roll, rice & entree for a decent price.   When I ordered through Yelp/ Eat24, I got a message saying that my order had been processed but that the restaurant was \"very busy,\" so my order wouldn't arrive on time and would come closer to 90 minutes later. My food came, after contacting customer service, after almost 2 hours. Kind of defeats the point of delivery.  The food was cold and the salad was warm and limp. The food had no discernable flavor - just kind of like neutral oil.  No bueno.",

We actually waited 2.5 hours, the food wasn't as hot as it probably could be. BUT the food was good.   We ordered: Orange chicken 4/5 - think of big boneless chicken tenders with a good orange glaze. Delish! Yellow tofu curry 3.5/5 - mild is actually pretty mild.  White rice - lumpy old rice nothing too crazy.   The prices are good and In the end we got our food but hey it's LV baby.",

They give variety of sauces on the side too and the presentation is excellent!  Panang Curry Chicken: Amazing, delicious, authentic! Curry and pepper was on point.   Crab Fried Rice: So good! Plenty of crab and egg mixed in with Thai fried rice just like home cooking.  Pad Se-Ew Noodle: OMG out of this world! Warm, saucy noodles with plenty of chicken, veggies and bean sprouts on the side.  Eggrolls: Free! Veggie and so freakin good that I ate them all lol.

The drawback for me is that the flavors are not balanced and sometimes the crispness of items like the tempura shrimp are soggy, and still served hot?  It's confusing for sure. I've also noticed that the spice level isn't consistent. Mild is really spicy, medium is really really spicy.. and I'm afraid to try \"hot\". This is from a guy that loves pretty spicy food.  My least favorite item that I thought I would love was the ginger chicken. Really spicy.. but otherwise bland and not a whole lot of chicken. Lots of veggies, which is nice.. but not allot of meat.   I've been a fan of their wonton soup however, and the crispy veggie eggrolls are good. Overall, I would prefer the fusion style Thai of places like LeThai on east Fremont.   Happy Eating too you!",

The ginger chicken had so much ginger pieces in it that it began to taste like cough syrup and there was nothing in it but slices of ginger, something that was julianned with a mandolin slicer and about a pound and a half of sliced bell peppers.  The basil shrimp had overcooked, flavorless, frozen shrimp, with more julianned something, at about a pound and a half of sliced bell peppers but with basil leaves added.  Each food comes with an overt amount of white rice and they charge you nearly $3 per dish to substitute brown rice.  In the end, I was either eating ginger cough syrup with chicken, or flavorless shrimp with mystery vegetable. And to add content and volume to the food they just put a pound and a half of green bell peppers in each dish.  It was truly nauseating.  I couldn't wait to get on Yelp to give them a poor rating and now as I write this my stomach is churning from the effervescence of the overt consumption of ginger.",

Next time we plan to be more adventurous because the food was very good.  Large portions, a lot of added proteins to the entrees, not greasy and very well packaged.  The noodle dish was a little bland, but it was still very good.  My fave was the crab Rangoon.

Very flavorful, and the sauce at the bottom of the salad one hell of a kick to it.   Then we split a chicken soup, medium spice, and it was delicious. Mushrooms, tomatoes, tender chicken, and lots of flavor. Def recommend getting the larger size- fair price and the novelty of the flame on your table is worth it.  Then we got the basil chicken- and here is where we messed up- we asked for it spicy. They do not mess around w spicy. My Latino husband- Mr.-mas-caliente-about-everything-normally- was sweating and teary eyed. I had a cold, so my sinuses were kinda blocked- and I took too bites and cried. BE WARNED!

In a city where a lot of people work overnights and are looking for somewhere with great food, Thai Pepper delivers!  I had to sample several dishes.  The Pad Thai was spiced just right, the chicken was done to perfection.  The Egg Rolls were delicious. The Corn Cakes hit all the right spots.  The chicken won tons were also great!  Although I have another favorite Thai place which I hit up about once a week, they close at 10.  The other place has just a little something that hits my craving consistently.  Thai Pepper is now definitely in my late night rotation.  Great food in the middle of the night, delivered?  Oh heck yes, I'll be back!",

    "text": "I am Thai and frequently eat at Thai restaurants, so I feel like I have a good grasp on what is okay Thai food, and what is delicious Thai food. Thai Pepper falls under delicious!  I came in while in Vegas craving something hot after being disappointed the previous day when eating at Pho Kim Long. There wasn't anyone else because they had just opened for the day but the place was clean and nicely decorated in a homey kind of way. There was a corner that had a setup for live music. The place is a lot bigger than it seems on the outside.  I judge Thai restaurants by how well they make my favorite dish, pad see ew. It's a flavorful stir fried noodle dish. I got the pad see ew beef, and my brother got the lard na (basically pad see ew with a gravy type sauce). My mom got the beef combo boat noodle and my dad got the pineapple fried rice   The bathroom could be worked on though. There was no toilet paper and the soap dispenser was broken in the men's bathroom but it was relatively clean. The women's bathroom had no toilet seat covers and was a little dirty. This is coming from someone who likes hole in the wall type restaurants.  My mom's boat noodles came in first. It's basically pho but way more flavorful. The broth was nice and dark, and the scent was so strong that my tummy rumbled in anticipation to try it. It tasted as good as it smelled, and the beef was soft and chewy. I  started to regret ordering my pad see ew when looking at her soup. 5/5.  My brother's lard na came in after. It looked beautiful, with lots of seafood including shrimp, squid, and mussels. I began feeling envious of his dish as well (I'm greedy! Haha) and asked for a taste. The noodles were so soft but chewy and had such a flavorful impact on my senses. The gravy was thick, the shrimp was huge and not that cheap, terrible pre-peeled tiny shrimp so many other restaurants tend to use. The flavor existed without adding chili too, which I love. 5/5  My pad see ew came in after, and after seeing those two dishes, I was really excited. Honestly though, nothing was wrong with the dish, but I've had pad see ew at many, many different Thai locations and this did not stand out. It did smell heavenly though, with that somewhat charred smell from the pan that shows that the chef was a professional at making pad see ew. Without that scent, you know the noodles will taste soft, mushy, or rubbery. The texture of these noodles were great. There was a fair amount of beef as well, but the size of the dish was a little small. It wasn't a knockout in terms of flavor like the other previous dishes. 4/5.  My dad's pineapple rice came in last, and it was probably the most disappointing out of the 4 dishes. It was average. The rice had the scent of chicken, lemongrass, and turmeric so it smelled very light and refreshing. The rice was a bit mushy. However, this fried rice dish was miles above the fried rice failure that I was served the day before at Pho Kim Long (beautiful but tasted like white rice with my eyes closed). With this dish, my dad believed that he has had better fried rice. 3/5.   Overall, I would recommend this place. The prices are very reasonable, and $10-15 will get you a delicious, hot meal. This is definitely a great place to eat on a budget and even a great place to eat even if you're not on a budget!",

    "text": "I had a late night craving for Thai food yesterday, after hosting a movie night with two friends. We decided to try Thai Pepper, because it had good reviews and was located less than 2 miles from our location.   When we ordered, we were told there would be 1 and a half hour wait time.  We were okay with this... except that the food actually took 3 hours to arrive.  I called the restaurant at least two times to check on the status of the food and about 2 and a half hours in, I was told that the food hadn't even left the restaurant yet.  I asked if we could receive a complimentary appetizer to makeup for the extreme lateness, but we were told that adding it to our order would place us in the back of the order queue and we would have to wait all over again.  WTF  When the food came, we didn't even get the egg rolls we ordered (they ran out apparently), instead we were given fried wontons... at least they tried to be accommodating.  The driver was friendly as well.  Portions were small.  Too much sauce - it was like the food was drowning in a puddle.  In fact, the liquid had spilled all over the inside of the bag and got everywhere in my apartment.   This is seriously unacceptable.  If they are so busy, then they should hire extra staff.  They should be able to afford it with their high delivery fee and minimum order price requirement.  Thai Pepper sucks.",

I received crab Rangoon's . I was upset being they are one of my favorite appetizers and I was with someone who'd never had them before . I know they contain imitation crab. But what I received had invisible crab I guess . Cause it had none in it . It was filled with straight cream cheese . I guess the majority of there clients are usually drunk and can't tell . Idk . But the orange chicken was basically dry chicken nuggets with watered down orange sauce at the bottom . The chicken wings came drenched heavily in oil . They had no taste besides tasting like oil  . I placed my order at 12:30 and it was supposed to get here at 1:45 . I figured it'd be worth the wait . The order was still being prepared at 1:45 . By 2 am I finally received my order . I wouldn't eat here again or recommend it .",

The rice was pretty good but the main dish I ordered was dried. When it came time to pay their machine was not working and failed attempts they asked for cash. I was not carrying cash in large amount and gave them another card to pay as well. It was their machine that had stopped working honestly. Finally the system accepted my card and I paid and left.

While it's not Chinese, they had items he wanted.  He order veggie fried rice, no oil, no egg, no onion. Looked great! Lots of veggies and even basil on top.  Pad Thai no egg, no oil, was made with choice of tofu. Spice level was a kick!   I wanted to try a tomato basil Pad Kee Mao type of dish and requested no onion, no oil.  It was not bad! Husband actually stole it from me and said it was the best dish in the whole order.  He ordered the vegetable egg rolls but I'm not sure why because I knew he would only eat one like he always does.  All and all he had a pretty good experience, lots of leftovers, and I enjoyed my baked potato and Buddha bowl I had already fixed myself ;D",

Lots of veggies. The soups were very lightly seasoned and was perfect for us. The soups were still hot upon delivering. And the dessert we ordered, the mango sticky rice which I think is a thai specialty, was also delicious. Loved the coconut flavour mixed w sweet a savoury taste, and with the refreshing tang of the mango. Yum. Would highly recommend this place.",

We came in around 10pm and were the only ones here, it is now 11:30pm and it is cracking! Almost all the tables are sat, people are drinking and singing karaoke, and the delivery service is constantly picking up food to go. Their customer service was great when we came in, but now it seems as though we may have been forgotten. I don't mind too much though because the karaoke singers are quite entertaining! They also get extra points for being open 24/7!",

Two bags of Thai goodness were delivered to the SLS lobby by 5am although the app estimated delivery at 5:33am. And the delivery guy was all smiles, very friendly.   Everything was piping hot, fresh, and delectable. I held back a star for authenticity as the cuisine is clearly prepped for the American palate, a contrast from the down home Thai fare I can get at 4am in Hollywood's Thai Town, back at home in Los Angeles.   Still, my expectations were exceeded since I wasn't expecting to float on the Mekong or anything. This hit the spot while breaking up the routine, continental breakfast monotony.",

    "text": "Open 24x7... yippee  This restaurant is located at the end of the Vegas strip near Stratosphere. Not many places are open very late at this side so a 24x7 thai place is really great.  AMBIENCE: The ambience is casual. They have a bar area and a live performance at nights. When we went here at 11 pm at night, a guy was singing some thai songs Karaoke style. Though we didn't understand what they meant, it was a pleasant background sound. The place is inside a strip mall and is just a little rundown but perfect for late night meals  FOOD: The food was delicious. Right from the fried wontons to the shrimp fried rice to the green curry... the food was cheap, came in generous quantities and was yummy. No complaints here  SERVICE: The only thing to complaint about was the service. It wasn't what you'll call slow because the appetizers were brought out quickly but the main course was spread out way too much. For just the two of us, the shrimp fried rice was brought out in good time but the green curry wasn't brought out before another good 15 mins. That was the case with our neighboring table too. That's weird when you have to sit and watch somebody else eat while you are starving.  Overall, I can totally visit this place again.",

It's relatively cheap , and they have a pretty decent lunch special  from 11-3. I ordered the red curry at a medium spice level. I typically eat very spicy food, but being my first time there I figured it would be safer to start medium to gauge it. It was the perfect amount. It had a good kick without taking away from the flavor, and I was having to ration out my water intake towards the end. So even if you do like spicy food be warned that medium is quite hot. Our entrees did come out at separate times which I imagine can be slightly awkward especially in larger groups, but all in all the food was good, the service was quick, and the bill was pretty low.",

Ordered shrimp pad see ewe, panang curry (chicken) and basil chicken. We normally do medium spicy but because of all the other comments went with mild. The basil chicken is served ground, like beef, and was the spiciest. We could have probably ordered medium on everything else except that one. It's full of flavor and goes well alone or with rice (you don't have to order extra, they give you plenty). Pad see ewe was on par with everywhere else I've eaten it and not overly oily. The shrimp was *slightly* dry and didn't soak up all of the flavors, my only complaint. The panang was delicious, fragrant, sweet and subtly spicy. Will try medium next time and order with broccoli since it just came with chicken and peppers. Chicken was soft and tender. They also gave us a free order of egg rolls (5!) with our order (we spent over a certain amount), a bunch of sauces and five fortune cookies. Thai Pepper is far better than the King and I, and comparable to Komol.",

Two other groups came in after us looking for the same special, and were equally disappointed. All they need to do is add two words to that sign saying \"weekdays only\" so as not to mislead people. The food is ok nothing spectacular. They skimped on the noodles in the pad thai and loaded it instead with a whole lot of bean sprouts just to fill the plate.",

They gave me a kinda funny look when I said I wanted the food at a spicy level of 10, as if to say \"you don't really want that, do you round-eye?\", but they still delivered.  The food was so hot I was damn near crying, and loved every second of it.  On top of that, it just plain tasted incredible.  Another thing - not a huge deal, but when I order a \"thai iced tea\" I want it to have the tapioca balls in it, and most places don't do that, but this place did.  Important to me, but I'm just odd like that.  The booths were comfy, but nothing special, the decor was pretty plain.  If you like excellent food at excellent prices and don't care about frilly decor, this is the place for you.",

Thai pepper is air conditioned and has a large beautiful bathroom for customers.   SERVICE: The Thai Pepper staff was friendly and very helpful. They helped us figure out which dishes were the vegan ones and even modified one of the dishes to make it vegan. The food arrive quickly.  FOOD: Thai Peppers food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. We ordered the Satay Tofu, spring rolls, Vegetable Fried rice (which is NOT vegan but they kindly made it for us without egg.) and other dishes that I cant remember. It was all very flavorful and not oily. It was the kind of food that you have to close your eyes to eat.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone, but especially the hungry vegans who are only surviving their Las Vegas trip with Ronald's Vegan donuts and cheese-less pizza. Go have some dinner! Go to THAI PEPPER!",

The portions seemed to have shrunk in size by almost 1/2, the large slices of white meat chicken were replaced by smaller pieces of chicken, some of which were fatty and it basically just wasn't as tasty. I entered about 8pm on a Tuesday night and nobody was in the place at all, so maybe the cook decided to hurry up and make my takeout order so he could go back to enjoying the family milling around. With so Thai places around, they need to excel everytime or else we are off down the street to the next one as will be the case with me.",

I have complained about this place with McDonald's corporate offices and filed a complaint with the health department.  Horrible experience and poor customer service!!!  I will never go back.  They also must have some wierd financial stuff going on as they told us that they would give us 10% discount if we paid in cash.  Does this mean they are not reporting thier real income to the IRS?

Though they were about to close, they still took our orders and stayed till we finished. The food was excellent and authentic Thai. The only issue was the food was surprisingly slow (compared to other Thai/Asian restaurants) to arrive and they had only one person taking the order for the whole restaurant. We did come back the second time for lunch the next day. Will go back for sure when I visit LV..",

    "text": "Recently went here for lunch with a few co-workers and I was not overly impressed.  The place only had one person working, so thankfully it was not busy or we could have be waiting a long time.  We were there while the lunch specials were still offered and we all ordered variations.  Initially we were given menus and allowed a few minutes to decide and then when it came time to order, the waiter started taking orders and then simply forgot to take the last person in our groups order.  We were a group of six and after taking the fifth order, he simply walked away and started doing other things.  After everyone got to order, the food started arriving within a decent time frame considering there was only one waiter.  I started with the pot stickers and they were pretty tasty.  Unlike the other pan fried pot stickers I have had, these were deep fried and it gave them a nice texture.  The soy based sauce that they were served with was also tasty, flavored with slices of pickled jalapeno.  I ordered the spicy basil chicken lunch special, which took longer to come out of the chicken than the other five dishes, a lot longer.  When I did receive my meal, I did think the flavor was pretty good, spicy but good.  Like most Thai places you order the spice level you desire on a scale of 1 -10 and I ordered a 5.  I would say their whole scale is a bit spicier than most, as the 5 was pretty dang spicy.  The lunch special came with a cup of very tasty vegetable soup in a clear broth.  Then the main dish was the spicy basil chicken, steamed rice and one small spring roll.  One pet peeve of mine is restaurants that serve canned soda, this is only made worse by charging $2 for said can of soda and that is how they do it here.  All in all I rounded up and gave this place 3 stars when the service etc made me want to assign 2 stars.  Overall the flavors were still quite good and that is ultimately what matters in my book.  I would return buy only for the lunch special, if it was any more expensive it would not be worth it.",

I like a little more coconut milk flavor (thicker) on the curry.  The most interesting thing ... even eating all over the country ... these were the hottest (temp) dishes I've ever had.  They stayed hot well after being served.  I know the wok cooking aided this, but I was wow; surprising.   The spice levels run 0-10 and for me, 7 and 8 were still okay and not overwhelming.

I'd have to say that I should have ordered something else, but I didn't.  I had the rad Na with seafood, and I wasn't overly impressed.  The Rad Na came with a lot of seafood: shrimp, squid, fish balls, mussels, and imitation crab.  The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce that was spicy.  It wasn't all that bad if you don't know Thai food.. almost like a spicy Chinese dish.  However, Rad Na is supposed to have a dark gravy sauce on it, and this just didn't cut it.    I did have the Thai tea, which was good.  The service was absurdly good.  The cute little Thai waitress was full of smiles and helpful suggestions (although it was a little hard to understand her).  I will have to try some of their other dishes some time and update my review if I find other dishes that are better, but for now I can't recommend this spot.  Sorry, Thai Pepper waitress!",

My husband put in the order for food on grubhub at 10:54pm and we were told that it was accepted and being made at 10:54. They said that the latest we would get our food (which is ridiculous but what can you do) was 12:05. Keep in mind that we tipped 20% in advance, without waiting to see what the service was going to be like (apparently a mistake). At 11:50, I'm kind of wondering where the food is because seriously, we've ordered from other Asian places that are way farther away and gotten really good food within 30 minutes. Needing over an hour is pretty ludicrous. We tried calling the number three times on each of our phones and it seemed to be shut off? Not very professional. Finally get through at 11:56 and someone very bluntly asked me what my address was and then the only detail I got was \"it's already out for delivery you will have it in minutes\". At 12:35 we get a call from the delivery driver asking for directions. My husband gave him simple directions to follow but he simply couldn't comprehend them so my husband ended up having to go out to the street to meet the delivery driver to get our food. It took from 10:54 to 12:38 to get the food and they couldn't even get it to our door. At least the food is amazingly still hot. I don't recommend this place unless you want to pay a delivery person money when you have to deliver your own food to yourself. I will say though that the food was pretty good. The stars are for the process and delivery.",

I complained to management and requested not to pay. He was very kind and understanding. He said please offer me a chance to try The Chopped Basil Chicken. Since you like Chinese food you may enjoy this... I tried it and I loved it!!!! I try to visit here weekly or whenever nearby. My son and I share a serving it is excellent!!! Great service and food!",

We had the combination platter, which was awesome but we did not need with the portion sizes they gave on the entrees-to start then the pineapple fried rice and the thai spice noodle with beef. Both were sooo good! Prices were reasonable as well.",

The chicken fried rice is good as well as the chicken chow mein. The crispy squid taste fresh and not rubbery. Chicken noodle soup is just right. They even put ice in the plastic bag of the bottled water I ordered. It's just that they couldn't deliver the food up to your room door if you are in a hotel that don't allow food delivery from outside due to security reason. You will have to meet them outside.",

Ordered through yelp and specifically asked for some plates. You know to eat off of since we are at a hotel. We ordered a out 6/7 different dishes and they didn't even send one extra plate. Asked for extra sweet and sour sauce and was willing to pay the extra didn't get that either.  They did give lots of sou and their nasty hot sauce but we didn't use the soy and the hot sauce was nasty. Order delivery at your own risk. I may actually go in and try it one trip.",

I eat a lot of Thai food and this place does not compare to the best ones you can find here in Las Vegas. I ordered full order of Rad Nah Stir Fried noodles and the noodles didn't even reach halfway though the Chinese take out box. The toppings (placed in a separate container for soups) look more like a bowl of soup with tofu and broccoli swimming in it. I also ordered Tom Yom Noodle Soup and it didn't taste like they used lemon grass at all because it didn't taste tangy, like most Tom Yum soup I've tasted before (and I've been to a lot of authentic places).  The eggplant dish is alright, taste a little burnt, like it was cooked on a wok that hasn't been cleaned.",

Appetizers - We normally alternate between getting the veggie egg rolls or the pot stickers. They have always been nice and crispy. Never soggy which I find happens a lot when I order take out from other restaurants.  We have on occasion ordered the Thai dumplings and they are delicious as well but it's just a matter of personal preference!  For entrees I alternate between yellow curry and green curry - Both are delicious but be warned if you don't specify how spicy you want it you could end up getting a hot surprise! With take out though I've noticed they normally include the spice on the side for you to mix in  yourself! My personal favorite is the green curry with chicken and extra vegetables! Can never go wrong.  If you're in the mood for something else though the pad thai is delicious as well. I normally get it with mild spice and chicken. Its a generous portion size so you will be full !   Only ever tried dessert once - We got the sticky rice with mango - it was good but it is a very very sweet dish. The rice is soaked in a sweet white syrup that tastes kind of like coconut - the mango that came in the dish though was delicious and ripe!   Overall they are pretty consistent with their dishes ! And the restaurant is open 24/7!",

Like if they would have more systematic way to take orders and all I think it would be a better customer experience. They are good if you are craving late at night Thai food that will make you get diarrhea then next day! I don't know what it is but 3times I eat here I always get diarrhea the next day but that can be from over eating too lol ! Don't get me wrong the food is actually pretty good but am not sure if it's clean or not.   Here is the thing; Last time we were here, a homeless man came inside the restaurant! Stared at our table for about 2minutes then he literally went and grabbed our food! My husband was in shock and had to get up to pushed the man! And he's usually super super sweet and befriended some homeless people in downtown Las Vegas! But cmon!! How could you let someone walked inside your restaurant and let him bother your patron??   Hmm.. I am not sure what else to say and how to give constructive criticism. :/ man.. I was wishing for a better service though for sure because food isn't bad to be honest!",

    "text": "My cousin was in town staying at the SLS for a quick layover so we decided to meet up for lunch.  Since we were in a time crunch cause I had to go back and pick up my son from school, we decided to hit up Thai Pepper since it was literally down the street from her hotel AND all her flight attendant friends had nothing but good things to say about it.    For the price, their lunch specials are great.  I mean you can't beat getting a full meal for about $6.  However, my cousin and I were pretty disappointed with the food itself.  After hearing so many great things about this place, my cousin more so.  Personally, we would rather pay a bit more for better tasting food.  I thought the food was lacking in flavor.  The pad thai was oily and way too watery.  The mongolian beef mainly had onions versus beef, and their egg rolls weren't fresh and chewy.  But their Thai tea was pretty good.  Cheap eats, but all in all, not sure if I'll be coming back for more.",

They have a lunch special, which gives you a miso soup, salad, egg roll and main course for $6-$7! So that's a killer deal if you are free from 11-3. Otherwise, their prices are still great.  I've had the green Thai curry, yellow Thai curry, pad Thai, crab Rangoon, and tom ka, and they were all so very good. I haven't ordered anything yet that hasn't been great.   It looks like they might be set up for karaoke, although I've never actually seen anyone karaoke here... maybe I've just missed the times.   The service can be very speedy if you are in a hurry, but I've never felt rushed out when I wasn't in a hurry.",

The amazing thing is, The restaurant is open from 10 AM to 6 AM daily. 20 hours a day ! I say that's amazing. It's in a grubby little shopping center next to a marijuana shop and McDonald's. However, it's conveniently located and it's worth the trip.  They Have a lunch special that's from 11 AM till 3pm every day $5.95. Amazing again. Because, it comes with rice and egg rolls and soup. They also have another lunch special for $7.95  that is the Shrimp dishes. The food is very good and spice level from 1 to 10. Shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu they have all of that to choose from. They even have fish dishes and their salad meals are pretty great also.  It's not the cleanest looking dining area. The decorations are old and could use a good dusting for sure but ,the food is good, and the price is right. I love stopping in here whenever I am in Las Vegas",

I liked the spicy basil shrimp but the lemon chicken was low-quality mostly-breading frozen chicken nuggets, unfortunately. Whatever you get, grab their Thai coffee though, because that was excellent.   Most of their business seems to be takeout, and being able to order through the Yelp app is convenient so I haven't written this place off completely. I wouldn't turn down a visit here but probably wouldn't be the one to suggest it either.",

We tried it again last night and it was a huge disappointment. Ordered papaya salad Lao style, chicken wings, chicken satay and sticky rice. Papaya salad come out doesn't looks as appetizing as it used to be, the colors was a lot darker than I remember, also there were two huge chunks of fermented fish sauce that hasn't been smash out evenly so it created a saltiness taste. Chicken wings came out with heavily battered that I have to removed the whole entire thick battered wrapper to get to the chicken pieces. After one bite I returned because the chicken wing Is not fresh as it been sitting in the fridge for a long time and they take it out and make a quick deep fried. But I didn't want to offend the owner so I asked to switch to Pad Kee Mao (Delicious). My friend doesn't like her chicken satay skewers. Im so disappointed this time around. Maybe they changed owner and the food is gone downhill , we won't be back. Not quality food.",

I ordered the Beef Salad and the Thai Sausage. It took 30 minutes to receive my Salad, which kind of lessened my mood here. However, I think Thai Pepper redeemed itself, and here's why.   About the Beef Salad, it was bold and exciting. Though, I recommend that you get the dressing on the side. The vegetables, along with the tangy and spicy sauce, gave the salad a unique flavor. Everything tasted really fresh!   About the Thai Sausage, its one-of-mind. It's a mixture of different meets like pork and pork skin. It has the right level of saltiness, and doesn't taste too fattening either - not drenched in oil. It has a nice side of peanuts too.   I'm going to give this place a 5 star overall because I think it's a 5-star for the price. Also, come for the lunch special between 11-3 PM.",

Although it took a few minutes to order because the cashier was writing down orders and fiddling around, our food was ready in about 10 min. All packed up with chili and soy sauce and utensils.    The food itself wasn't spectacular. It was good because we were starving, but light on the spices and the chicken. Good for a late night snack at 8$ each. They also have a 6$ lunch special. If I was ever starving and stranded in the area, I would definitely take advantage of the quick service and cheap eats. Not a culinary masterpiece, but good enough.",

For $70 We got:   Combo appetizer- was ok, crab Rangoon was a little off tasting, tofu was a little soggy but that's expected with delivery, egg rolls were ok, chicken potstickers were ok, the other thing (don't remember what it's called) that was included was decently good. Ordered this because there's absolutely no pork in it which is great.  Tom kha shrimp soup- really good but the shrimp was dry because it over cooked in the piping hot soup  Panang chicken curry- really good but asked for no spice so baby could eat it but still spicy   Shrimp chow mein- weird noodles used but ok flavor, not like Chinese chow mein but that's to be expected because it's Thai  Garlic pepper chicken and rice- pretty good with much rooms in it  Mango sticky rice- good but no condensed milk on it so the rice was really dry  Bottled water Coke  Don't order food when you are really hungry. We barely made a dent in the food because the portions are so big. Lots of leftovers for breakfast I guess.  My go to for when in Vegas and just want to veg out in the room",

    "text": "My co-workers and I thought we would try this place out on a Friday afternoon. We contacted Thai Pepper to find out if they delivered and how much time it would take for the delivery.  We were told the wait time was approximately one hour for delivery.  We placed the order with the anticipation that we would be eating at or around our scheduled lunch time.  Note - the restaurant is barely 5 miles away from our place of employment.  30 minutes after the expected delivery time we contacted Thai Pepper to see what the hold up was as they were now cutting in to our lunchtime and we were starving. Thai Pepper advised that the driver was on the way. Another 30 minutes goes by and we call again.  Thai Pepper gives us the number to the driver to ask him about the delivery time.  The driver states that our place of employment is really far and that he was 15 minutes away. At this point it's beyond ridiculous that is has been 2 hours since the initial order was placed and the driver has the nerve to say that 5 miles is too far!  Seriously?!  We told the driver to forget the order as we could no longer wait and lunch time is now over!  30 minutes later the driver shows up! Are you serious? We told the driver the order was cancelled since he's forgotten the conversation from 30 minutes ago that promised delivery in 15 minutes. What a joke.  Good thing I have some crackers I can share with my co-workers to eat at our desk while we work.",

I consider it a fairly easy walk from those places, but with the Vegas heat and those long Vegas city blocks you may not agree.  Anyway, the bottom line here is that the food is really god damn good. Their lunch special is an outrageously good value for what you get, and it isn't just sugary globs of fried meat like with most Asian lunch specials. Here they bring you an entree, soup, salad, rice, and an egg roll or potsticker for 5.95. At a casino that's gonna cost you 30 bucks and it wouldn't taste half as good as here.  The sauces they use have the perfect balance of salty, spicy, and sweet. There are lots of crisp fresh veggies mixed in. To me that's what good Thai food is all about.   Now step away from the slot machine or craps table, leave the casino for once, and go eat here, will ya?",

Especially the Cool special!!! So I thought why not try out this Thai pepper and hopefully they live up to the name of its twin restaurant. The food was very good for how late it was and how soon it was delivered. I always feel like late night spots kind of slip on the quality of food when it gets late, like you know it doesn't taste as good as it would during morning hours. But like I said the pad Thai was rather good compared to the fried rice. Maybe I'm biased but I love pad Thai!",

Since we were staying at SLS, this restaurant was within walking distance and my friend said that she had dined here before.  We ordered chicken wings, papaya salad, chicken satay, and sticky rice. Her wings came out first and was thickly battered. She said it was too salty and sent it back. She asked for the Thai spicy noodles with chicken instead. During this time, my chicken satay and sticky rice arrived. Her papaya salad came out shortly afterwards.  I tried some of her papaya salad, but it was alright. My chicken satay was alright. My friend was getting impatient when her noodles didn't arrive yet, but the wait wasn't even that long. The noodles didn't look that appetizing, but were surprisingly tasty.  While we were dining, there was someone trying to sing karaoke and it was pretty bad. I think she worked there because she sang the entire time. We were both disappointed in the food that we had that night, especially since she remembered it being really good, but that was many years ago.",

    "text": "Recently staying at a hotel nearby on business I spotted Thai Pepper while out on a run. I noted it, and checked the reviews and figured I'd give it a shot. I really enjoy good Thai food which for whatever reason is fairly difficult to find at home. So with that I stopped in for some take out.  The interior is pleasant with lots of seating and even what appeared to be a small stage for perhaps some evening entertainment. They were quite busy while I was there with what seemed to be mostly locals which in my book is always a plus. The menu is extensive with the standard Thai dishes you would expect. I decided on the Drunken Noodles with tofu level 8 spice level (you can order spice from 1-10). My dish was prepared quickly, I paid and off I went to enjoy it in my room.  The Drunken Noodles were very good with a nice assortment of veggies, carrots, string beans, onions, garlic and tofu. I was quite pleased with the texture of the tofu as it wasn't mushy like steamed tofu can get nor fried to a crisp. The flavors of the dish were great and seemed much more authentic then the standard over sweet, under spiced Thai dishes I come across frequently at home in Florida. The only complaint was that level 8 spice was not quite hot enough for me. They did include some chili paste to make it hotter which helped but not quite the heat level I was anticipating for level 8. I'll know better to just go all out for 10.  The employees were friendly. I was served a hot and delicious meal to go very quickly during a busy time of day. They have daily lunch menu that looked tasty and frankly quite inexpensive. I'll definitely be back given the opportunity in the future.",

We were recommended by a local and glad we stopped by. Very friendly service and they make sure you are taken care of. We had their chicken satay and was thinly cut chicken with a tasty peanut sauce. My fiance ordered their bbq pork wonton soup and it was very delicious without being overly salty. I hate salty food. It came piping hot like the rest of our entrees. I definitely will be back to try their pad Thai and pad see ew. Their coconut water came in the whole coconut and was fantastic! You can't beat this place in price and solid food!",

The lunch special is only $5.95, and the portion is pretty large. I ordered the pad Thai and substituted tofu for chicken. When I ordered, I was asked if eggs were okay, which I thought was very thoughtful.   I sadly thought the pad Thai didn't have much flavor. The tofu was beyond bland and rubbery. The egg roll was okay. The side salad was nice addition and I loved the dressing! For the price, I still think this place is worth checking out.   The atmosphere was divey. They had records all along one wall. In the back there was a mini stage, with instruments. Not sure if they have karaoke or live music. Either would make a fun date night!",

And I have had Pad Thai in Thailand.  everyone judges by different standards. But my experience was phenomenal. Not too busy, but constantly had people coming in and out. Had some yummy bean sprouts on top that just set it over the edge. I also had some green tea with my meal. Nommmmm!",

So much to the point where our service was a little slow because everyone is going in and out making deliveries and not really one person waiting a table. :/ But... I didn't mind too much because..  Everyone was so sweet and we were approached by a few different people asking if we were ok. (Even though they forgot our drinks at first. Oops!) I felt like I was at a family party but didn't know anyone, but everyone tries to make you feel comfortable! Lol. I was feeling the vibe and diggin the people out there being themselves while  singing Karaoke all night and enjoying some drinks too. :)  The food was delicious, good bang for your buck, and home-like. Shareable portions! Like when you go to a friend's family party and there is at least one aunt that throws down in the kitchen and your flimsy plate is about to fall apart because there is so much food on it. Lol.   All in all, a great casual spot with good eats! And I must say, the leftovers were pretty good too! Next time, I'm bringing a bigger appetite!",

So yummy with plain rice! I also got the beef salad which tasted fresh and hit the spot! Lots of veggies with thick slices of beef. The crab fried rice was a bit too \"crabby\" for my liking BUT my fiance loved it so I think it really just depends on your tastebuds. Lastly, Thai Tea is another must order for me however I felt it was a bit too much cream and not enough tea. Still drank it all though! I definitely plan to eat more from here in the future.",

However, we feel that the customer service could have been much better. Being vegetarians, we were required to order a vegetarian dish and the staff was not willing to make a meat dish using vegetarian ingredients. We found this odd because all of the other Thai restaurants we had been to in the past were usually flexible in converting meat specialties to vegetarian. Furthermore, we simply sat there for a long time waiting for someone to take our order. Apart from the service, the food was incredible! The dinner portion sizes were huge and pricing was unquestionably reasonable. For example, a large bowl of Yellow Curry and Rice was only around $9. Also, their lunch special is $5.99 which includes a bowl of soup, an egg roll, and select entree items! Definitely visiting again when we return to Vegas!",

The neighborhood is a little sketchy and the last time we were in there, there were a couple of troublesome kids hanging around (I realize I sound like an old lady saying that...but it's True!) and the staff didn't really know how to deal with them.  Obviously that doesn't reflect on the restaurant or the quality of the food, but it made the experience slightly uncomfortable.  Overall I would recommend this place, especially if you are on the north end of the Strip.  It's pretty solid food and the prices are fair, especially with a Yelp deal.",

Noodles were gross, shrimp was slimy, chicken was hard and we had to ask the waitress to microwave everything because the food was like straight out of the fridge or something! The karaoke singers (or maybe they were the house band because they went on and on and on and were like playing the instruments) were so awful and annoying and I just don't know why we didn't walk out of there! The BEST part of the evening was right at the end when the waitress came to our table and dropped off the check then when we pulled out the card to pay she made it a point to say we should give her the tip in cash then stood there until we handed her some cash! She didn't even take the card and bill with her, we had to walk it up to the register. Honestly, the service and food was so awful that she didn't deserve any kind of tip but the fact that she assumed she would get some cash then stand there until she got some was so shocking that my wife just handed her 10 bucks and we got the eff outta there! Ugh, never going back there!",

Our hotel did not allow them to deliver inside the hotel, so we met them down in valet to get our food, but this extra step was worth it and still efficient. We definitely recommend Thai Pepper!",

Coming from Southern California where asian food is available in every city, this is the most bland tasting asian food I've had in a while. I would genuinely prefer the flavors of Panda Express more.  My girlfriend got the pad thai which was recommended by grubhub but it ultimately tasted like boiled noodles with rubber beef as a garnish. If it weren't for the lemon included, it would be virtually tasteless.  I got the pineapple fried rice which is more flavorful in my opinion but is heavy on the curry powder. Aside from that, you really need to find a peice of raisin, pineapple, or  tomato, to add flavor to the rice with flickers of curry. Unlike the pad thai beef, the chicken does hold a smidge of flavor on it's own.  Although those were our main dishes, the best part of the meal were our appetizers the potstickers and the free egg rolls (if you order more than $25). These 2 were obviously the easiest to make (deep fry) and were the best tasting. So thank goodness we didn't only order the entrees.  Although the entrees were a bit bland, the appetizers and the fact that they delivered at midnight makes it somewhat satisfactory but it most definitely wasn't worth the price. This place just wasn't my Thai-pe (type).",

I was primarily disappointed with the Tom Kha (the coconut milk & lemongrass soup). Only, there WAS NO coconut milk! I even paid extra for the hot pot instead of the bowl & they gave me the bowl size. I HATE THAT! So stingey! So just a warning - don't get the Tom kha thinking it's Tom kha because it's actually Tom yum which is just a very basic boring hot & sour soup. NO flavor whatsoever I could've made it at home. So I'm really disappointed with not getting what I paid for. Oh well.",

I have a great time watchin their staff's belch out some great Thai pop songs or sing a few Thai accent Chinese songs which always gave me a laugh! Even though Thai Pepper is near the strip n the SLS hotel!  Their prices is very fair n affordable! Especially their lunch specials! My favorite dishes to order here is their Pad Se-Ew, Combo Beef Noodle Soup n the Seafood Salad. And the best part about Thai Pepper is that they r open almost 24/7.",

    "text": "NOT impressed!   OK - If Lotus of Siam and Thai Style Noodle House are 4 Stars in Vegas then this can't be four stars!!!  If you are desperately starving for ANY Thai and absolutely can not travel or drunk then eat here.  Food - OK, Staff- Friendly, Menu prices - a few are incorrect and they know it.  Appears equal too or more expensive than Chinatown with less quality.  NOT clean! Bathroom and back area...Dump.  Typical old world Asian dive that doesn't understand expectations of new world cleanliness.  Owner doesn't have pride in his product since people keep buying.  Being clean doesn't cost much money.  Just look at the dust and junk around the cash register.. then look up at the 1/8 black filth sticking to the air vents. Then visit the bathroom.  Advice-Take an uber or 25 minute bus ride to Chinatown... eat great food, get a $35/hour message, bring back some Chinese baked goods for breakfast... He is 200 yards from all the fantastic SLS HOTEL restaurants (go there and get an umami burger!).  It appears the last time they really cleaned was for the wedding 2+ years ago in the other pics. Unless it is a table top they don't appear to dust and I don't think they own a vacuum (only a broom).  The cooking area appeared ok through the serving window but if the customer area is dirty do you really think the back is spotless?  To be fair - I only ordered Pork w/sticky rice (special of the day), mango sticky rice, and Thai iced coffee. Pork dish - Tender, rice marginal - stiff, flavor - good but accompanying sauce was very salty. Mango - perfectly ripeness, rice - fine, all items drenched in condensed milk and Coconut milk making this the sweetest mango sticky rice ever eaten. Thai Iced coffee - strong but very sweet so I drank half.",

    "text": "it was 3 in the morning and a friend who lived in Vegas suggested to eat here for Thai after hours. when we arrived, i felt the restaurant was a small mom&pop restaurant. it was really small inside and kind of old style. i didn't have high expectations for this place because it didn't look very pretty inside haha and i also noticed they had like a karaoke/dance floor further into the restaurant near the bathrooms...interesting.   while we were waiting for our food, i noticed they had lots of to-go orders and people coming in for take-outs. that made me think 1. their food is really good or 2. its just too late to get anything else anywhere else lol   our food took quit some time to arrive even though we were the only patrons in the restaurant. probably because of all the to-go orders they were making (which kept coming out). we ordered egg rolls, panang curry, pad see ew, and my friend got some kind of stir fried beef or chicken dish. surprisingly though, everything that came out tasted surprisingly flavorful! the portion size for the pad see ew was really small. my boyfriend was able to finish it in a few bites so we couldn't really share. the other two dishes were good portioned! the curry tasted really good with the rice together! and the pad see ew had lots of flavor!   all in all, for a little hole in the wall this place tasted great! it just needs a little different set up because the restaurant itself has very limited seating.",

HOLY COW. my friends were happy with there but i have never enjoyed wings like this before. reminded me of asian zing wings at bww except more fresh. literally i dumped that delicious sauce it came with all over those wings and went to town.  pretty much what I'm saying is skip all the other late night food places and go back to your hotel and order from this place.

In addition, it must of been karaoke night because whomever was singing was on fire. They have all the Thai staples at this restaurant and in good portion too.

All of a sudden I get the call, 'Kimberley?\" in a very thick asian accent.  \"Yes?\"  (I wondering what's wrong....) \"We have your order and we will be 20 min\"..... okay I'm thinking,,,,, HUH?  what do you mean 20 minutes?  20 minutes till they get the order cooked and done or 20 minutes until you are on my front door?  They had all the hotel info, but then informed me that they were not allowed up to the room.  I'm worried.... Does this mean that he is downstairs right freeking now???!  So I proceed to ask him a series of questions...... \"ARE you downstairs right now???\" , he says \"No, 20 mins\".  Im still puzzled.  He then says, \"I'm not allowed to come up to your room, only lobby\".  I'm thinking....are you in the lobby RIGHT NOW????  He says, \"No, See you in 20 mins\".  and I'm thinking ...okay, we have figured out the plan now.  Then he says \"I've been waiting 20 mins\".  OMG!!!!!!!! Now what?!?!?!!!!  Does this mean he has been WAITING downstairs for 20 mins now????!  What the hell!  Finally we come to an agreement that he is in fact, NOT downstairs and I tell him to call me when he is in the lobby.  He then says again, \"See you in lobby\", with a thick accent and very little english.  I'm going bat shit now....  I hang up thinking, am I going to see food tonight or not??   He calls in 15 more minutes, \"Kimberley...I in lobby\".  then he mumbles something about coming up to my room.  I'm thinking ARE YOU COMING TO THE DOOR???  He then states that security won't let him upstairs.  Well.... I can get security to bring you upstairs.... He then says, No, security says no..... I'm pulling my hair out by now.....  All I had ready was a bathrobe and slippers.... so I went down to the lobby in front of everyone who was checking in..... to get my food.  He's sitting there and jumps up right away.... GOOD GUESS...since we have never met before.  Seriously, for the $, this food is totally legit.  Very authentic and very very tasty.  I had the Papaya Salad, which was probably the best I've tasted in years & Red Curry with beef, it was so addictive I wanted to eat the entire tub full but that's way way too much, the chicken satay, it wasn't dry, tasteless at all with the same greasy peanut sauce that everybody uses...it was in fact a cut above.  Everything was fresh, the lettuce, the onions, the tomatoes.... everything was recently prepared just for my order and for that they get a GREAT BIG gold star!",

I have been to this place several times before and even though I was aware of its not so fancy location, I have enjoyed what I considered decent food for not too much money.  That was until recently, when I noticed a roach stuck on the inside of the clear plastic take out container for my red curry.  I found the nasty surprise after I had enjoyed the last spoonful of tofu and veggies with some of the broth and after I had put my spoon back in the container.  I was about to pick up the container to dispose of it and there it was, stuck to the side of the container after I had enjoyed the last bite and only some of the curry broth was left in the container.   This was no doubt, the worst experienced I have ever had while eating out!  Who knows how many times this had happened previously, considering that the employee or owner of this place was very apologetic, first over the phone, then in person, and did not even question the fact that I wanted my money back. She even dared to ask if I wanted something else...  Give me a break!!!!  When I got to the restaurant  to get my money back and showed them the proof of my horrible experience, all the lady could  say was that she was sorry and that she would tell the cook to be more careful.  Really????  Needless to say, I am never going back to this place, and who knows when,  if ever, would I get take out or Thai food again... At least not for a good while , but if I do, I would be very paranoid and extremely cautious.    Let's face it, these things happen, insects get into these places, but the fact that these things end up in your food makes you wonder how careless they are when it comes to hygiene before and right up  until the food is prepared, that is just simply ridiculous and inexcusable!!!",

Seems like a lot of people order there for lunch because it took them 45 minutes to give me my order. It looks like it would be a hole in the wall but when you enter its pretty big. Kinda old school they had the beetles posters on the wall along with some vinyl discs.   I thought the pad thai would be served just by itself but they also included a big scoop of rice a side salad and an eggroll. The pad thai was good, could use a little bit more flavor than spice. Lots of pieces of chicken and bean sprouts.   Overall my lunch was good, kind of a small serving but I paid less than $10 so I cant go wrong with that. Next time I would like to try that place for dinner and see how really good their other dishes are.",

We called to order and they were very nice and we were even able to pay over the phone! They said it would be an hour wait for delivery but it actually came in about 30 minutes. The delivery guy was very nice with a smile on his face (even though it was almost 1am and we had missed his several calls). The food was good, but mostly we loved the service and that theyre open so late. Definitely gonna order from them again!",
