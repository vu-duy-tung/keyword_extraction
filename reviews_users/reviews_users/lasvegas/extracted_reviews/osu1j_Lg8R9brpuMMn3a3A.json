Waiters here are super sweet, since you are paying an arm or leg. Lunch is roughly $35/person, so be hungry!!  They start you off with some appetizers and a big salad bar on the side, but don't waste too much time on it! Even the waiters told us that you should save your stomach for the meat selection.  You get a card to use in getting your meat. Green means keep it coming, and Red means stop. The meat carriers will all stop by your table at a green. Every one is different and they circle around multiple times with freshly cooked meat.  The selection was amazing. Fresh sirloin, lamb chops, bacon wrapped chicken, the list goes on.  It is expensive, but it's definitely worth trying! You won't regret it!",

Just lots of meat. Lots. Yum.   Creme Brulee was tasty. Huge serving. Split dessert by all means. I also had a traditional Brazilian cocktail but don't remember what it was called, but it was limey and sugary and delicious.    Really good place.",

Other pleasantries were special dishes being offered at the table along with offerings of special cocktails.Also that the  the servers were offering so many cuts of beef and not so much chicken and sausage. Btw.......best shrimp cocktail ever!!!",

During our event, service was seamless and smooth. Dessert service took a little long, but i think there was some miscommunication between cake cutting and tableside dessert service.

We wanted to try a buffet for lunch and figured we'd try Fogo since we love Brazilian BBQ. Best decision for lunch I've ever made in Vegas.  It was $26.50 during lunchtime for 15 different cuts of meat. The service was impeccable and the meats melted in my mouth. This is a really nice place and I'm so happy that the staff welcomed us with open arms. Once you sit down, you can peruse through the salad bar for your sides. I'm smart enough to know not to fill up on that stuff though... you have to save your stomach for the meat and get your money's worth. There's a card where your seat is with a green and red side -- green light and red light if you will, for the sake of letting the staff know if you want meat or if you want to take a break. Once I flipped my green side up, the meat kept coming non-stop. I could barely even take one bite before the next guy came with the next cut. It wasn't long until I had a take a break from the action.   FDC is the best Brazilian churrascaria I've ever been to. The meats were fantastic and my party received nothing short of great service. I definitely didn't get my money's worth, but the meat was so good that I don't even care!",

Fogo's atmosphere was not as impressive as TDB's warm colors, tapestries and large open rooms. TEXAS -Salad Bar: My favorite part of the Brazilian barbecue experience is the salad bar... Fogo's was ok but only if that was the only Brazilian barbecue that you've ever been to.. They had limited and not very impressive selections. TDB has way better cheese selection, more fresh looking ingredients and lobster bisque...yumm.. I also found myself wanting to go for seconds at TDB and not Fogo... TEXAS -Cocktail Bar/Wine List: We perused the wine & cocktail list at Fogo for quite a long time but couldn't find anything that caught or eyes... I feel that at TDB they have a way better and larger selection... TEXAS -Cheese Puff Bread: I love those little cheese puffs so much that I even attempted to make them at home but i feel like the ones that i made tastes better than Fogo's... At TDB I have to stop myself from filling up on those addicting little suckers... TEXAS -Meat: I am not much of a meat person but I found that I have been eating much more of it as of late... At Fogo I really appreciated how they would cook up a fresh batch of meat and bring it straight to your table if they did not have it circulating on the floor.. and not just the specific meat but the specific meat to the way you wanted it cooked. I feel as though the meat at TDB can sometimes be a tad bit salty for my palette..  I would score this category as a tie but the last selection of meat that Fogo brought out, freshly grilled lamb chops, was divine... not too gamey and perfectly cooked.... FOGO -Service: was great at both places.... TIE  *So you can decide for yourselves but if I had to choose again which place to go to I would definitely choose Texas De Brazil.   HOT TIP: The napkins in the bathroom at Fogo are just as wonderful as the napkins at TDB... if you know what I'm talking about... LOL",

I have had the same dining experience in Sao Paolo, Brazil, Minneapolis, MN, Atlanta, GA and Las Vegas, NV.   Usually, I would consider this boring and typical of chain restaurants like Chilli's, but when the experience is so AWESOME, you want it to be repeated and they deliver!!",

We decided to go here for lunch, and it wasn't crowded, but there were enough people to make it a pleasant dining experience. Our server was great, as well as all of the gauchos who came to our table to provide us meats they were serving. I had never been to this type of restaurant before, and I have to say, I enjoyed every second of it. It was an expensive lunch, but what the heck, we were in Las Vegas, and it didn't matter.... had great food and service.",

Jose was the supervisor and was our server for most of our dinner. There was another server but Jose stood out the most because he was checking to make sure we were doing ok. Now to the best part the food, they have a really good salad bar and extras like rice, beans, potato salad, chicken salad and more. They also start you off with bread and they bring you sides like garlic mashed potatoes. Be prepared to eat until u can't breath haha. Once the meat starts coming around they have so many delicious choices. My experience at fogo was great and I thank Jose for being so great to us and everyone at fogo! I need some time to recover from all that food and I will be returning soon!",

I loved the ribs and filet mignon.

At 745 we asked how much longer and the host told us there were still third in line to be seated, so basically another 15-30min wait. I'm pretty patient and I understand they were busy but they should just say they don't take reservations. We were starving and eventually decided we couldn't wait any longer. It was a complete waste of time and practically ruined our night.",

They were so amazed at how many meat selections were coming at them from left and right, they were in meat heaven!    As for me I have to say, I'm not much of a meat lover, so I indulged mostly on their salad bar....probably one of the best salad bar I've experienced for a Brazialian steakhouse, nice fresh selections of salmon, cheese, pastas, and so on.    Their lamb chops where the best that I've had.  I did not care for their filet mignon wrapped in bacon, it was a little flavorless. All in all, it was a great experience with all servers and staff!",

I came in in shorts, nice ones, mind you, but they were still shorts.  2. The service is amazing. As soon as the hubs needed a refill of his beer, or as soon as our sides needed some replenishing, someone was at our table before we could even ask for assistance.  The meats here tasted fantastic, as I've expected from Fogo de Chao. All in all, it was a great dinner and I'd urge anyone to come here for some quality meats (love the fraldinha, the bottom sirloin, and picanha, the top sirloin), salad, and the amazing sides (warm cheese bread, polenta, and caramalized bananas).",

Salad bar is far better at TDB, you get soup, some seafood selection, more variety of items--at FDC no soup and salad bar just has mostly \"salad\" without the extras.  All the sides at TDB have more flavor, ESP the garlic mash, at FDC it's not garlic, just plain potatoes with a little garnish of cheese and green onion.  Cheese rolls are decent but again better at TDB.  We opted out of the desserts, but those too were not impressive.  Price per person was $48.50 and it seemed their meat servers were not running around as often as those at TDB.  Service was good, but your $$ is better spent at TDB!

After the salad bar, we were ready to try the meat selections, bacon wrapped filet, lamb chops, leg of lamb, sirloin, sausage, chicken, pork tenderloin......all of it flavorful, juicy, tender.  The service was impeccable, the meat  gaucho's  were always there ready to offer the next tasty morsel.  The meal was  about $25 a person, a BARGAIN by Las Vegas standards.

    "text": "For my husband's birthday we decided to try this place out, since we're fans of Texas de Brazil.  Well, don't worry about losing us, TdB, because we were entirely unimpressed. Most of the reviews here mention the wonderful service; I feel like we must have been in another universe entirely.  We arrived early and were seated promptly, but that was about it for the service perks.  We had HORRIBLE service, especially from the meat-bearing men (you know what I mean).  We both had our cards on green, and time and time and time again we were passed by!  It was so bad at one point I even held mine up and waved it in the air (I didn't mean to be so obnoxious but I was seriously annoyed) and STILL no one came by!  We were seated around plenty of other tables and they were served, we even tried calling out to them and got nothing.  The manager came by and we asked for him to send two different types of meat over, he said okay and left.  They NEVER SHOWED UP.  We flagged down another server and asked and finally got them.  Our plates sat empty for the majority of the meal because no one would serve us!  I have never experienced this at TdB or any other restaurant where we paid over $100 for a meal. The meat itself wasn't bad, I really appreciated the menu to see what we hadn't yet tried.  My husband preferred the way the meat is seasoned at TdB, and I will say that I have a different understanding of \"medium rare\" than these chefs do, but to each his own.  The polenta fries were DELICIOUS, but as for the other sides we prefer TdB.  And the salad bar felt lacking, but this could be a personal thing as I do love my lobster bisque and they don't have it.  My husband ordered a cocktail, I passed on a glass of wine because prices starting at $11 seemed unreasonable (and we're locals, I feel like it's hard to surprise us with expensive drinks).  His drink was over $13 but it was tasty (however, it was a smaller sized portion). Finally, as mentioned, it was his birthday.  So we ordered dessert and were served with a lovely chocolate cake with a plate that read, \"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!\"  We thought this was hilarious, but I was annoyed, I had obviously mentioned it was his birthday when making the reservation.  The manager came over to wish us happy anniversary and we laughed and told him it was my husband's birthday actually, then the manager said, \"Well, did you say anniversary on the phone?\"  Ummm... no, no I didn't, I'm pretty sure I specified birthday. Overall, we were definitely underwhelmed and will not return.  Considering the high prices, abhorrent service, and dishes that are not on par with TdB, it was a disappointment.",

    "text": "Very much like Texas de Brazil. The service is better, the meat is better, the salad bar is smaller and lacks some of my favorites from Texas de Brazil. That being said, Fogo's service and meat quality makes it my top Brazilian BBQ spot in town. Also, their cheesy bread balls are the best I've ever had, I think I ate 6 of them. This is where service comes into play, I never once had to ask for more bread or fried bananas, in fact, often these items were refreshed before we were even done with the previous order.",

Being Brazilian, I always miss the authentic food and I can tell you, that's the place to go. Amazing tasty cuts of meat, sides are awesome and the service, well the service is absolutely outstanding. They serve so many different meats... You can have all the filet mignon you can eat! The black beans are delicious and I love their fried polenta. I have tried Fogo de Chao in Sao Paulo, Brazil and in California, and all I see is the same consistency of one of the best restaurants I  have ever eaten at. Stay away from the other Brazilian steak houses on the strip. This is the place to go to.",

I mostly wanted the salad bar but I did have lamb rack and lamb chops.  The meat was delicious!  I liked the variety of the salad bar and it wasn't all typical items you'd find at a salad bar.  There was very thinly sliced pineapple, very thinly sliced papaya, sun dried tomatoes, hearts of palm, bottoms of artichokes, apple salad, etc.  There were a few items I could not have being pregnant: smoked salmon and cured meats at the salad bar, and sausage that was being brought around by the servers.  Not to worry though because there were plenty of other options.  I don't know how often I would come back but it was definitely a fun place to try and the service was impeccable.",

We were greeted with the usual big smiles and welcoming hello that I have found at all the Fogo locations.   All the teams are really special and this location is no exception.  This is a big spot and there are  lots and lots of tables here.  The salad bars are pretty much the same from location to location but due to a couple of large groups in the house there was a line, very unusual.  This location also had soup, never saw that  before.   I'm not going through all the meats but I must say that they were all outstanding and incredibly flavorful.   My favorites are the lamb chops, pork ribs and short ribs/. We asked for more well cooked and that's what they brought.   All the food was served hot.  They have such a great staff, but I MUST give special Kudos to our incredible server Franci.  Without a doubt one of the best servers we've ever had, at any restaurant.  It's good to see a restaurant of this size working so well to create an exceptional dining experience.",

    "text": "I have eaten here in the past and received good service however, our most recent experience yesterday was a bit disappointing.  At many Brazilian restaurants, I and my family love the cheese bread (Pao de Quijo). As my mom had been eating a roll during our dinner, she found a long strand of hair inside. This happened in the later half of our dinner but decided to inform the Manager anyways and he simply replies, \"I'm sorry. What do you want me to do about that? I assume you don't want anymore bread then.\" His response was very short and did not seem genuine whatsoever. Thankfully he exchanged her plates although we were done eating already. After our dinner, our server kindly let us know any dessert we would like will be deducted from the bill because of this experience. As the dessert arrives, the Manager reappears and says \"Here you go. Hopefully there's no hair in this.\"  Our intentions were never to get a dessert nor start any malicious drama but simply to let them know whoever made the bread, may have lost a strand of hair in the batch. For the price I spent at dinner, I was just expecting a more sympathetic / formal conversation with the Manager.",

Silly me should have checked yelp!     I met him at the restaurant and he explained Brazilian Steakhouse to me.  Said to ask for small pieces so I could try everything!  I told him o was starving so this would be a great treat considering this was my first meal in 12 hours!  The waiter explained the \"button\". Turn it over to have the servers come and flip it to stop.  They offered us a visit to the \"salad bar\" which was loaded with tasty treat. Mushrooms, olives, salad, salami etc.  I could have gotten full just eating that!  I returned to my seat and the treat began.   all types of meat and sausages were brought to us on skewers.  The first few skewers I just had the server slice me a normal size and my friend warned me..small pieces!     I lost track of how many different meats we ate all prepared and sliced differently.  Everything they brought was incredibly delicious!  The lamb, the ribeye, cowboy steak etc...just an amazing sensory delight on the tongue!   I had seconds on the sausage as it was so perfectly cooked and seasoned.   I had thirds on the ribeye!!     I've already recommended this to place to three friends heading to Vegas!  Definitely worth the drive from the strip and the mall itself a great visit!",

I highly suggest the garlic sirloin and the flat steak! I'm a huge fan of mashed potatoes and I have to put theres in my top 3.  The service was great as well! Whenever I needed help or more meat they came rather quickly and if you don't like something they will take it away from you no worries.  They also have a valet and it's a fancy \"white cloth\" type of dining which is great for a fancy date. Don't be scared to get messy though it's better that way.  I give this a 5 star hands down and if you gave this place any less you're just a negative person or a vegetarian lol.  Thanks for a great night Fogo De Chao!",

It was our anniversary weekend and the food did not disappoint one bit.  The absolute best thing about having an anniversary dinner at Fogo is, you get an anniversary desert on the house and that we were seated right in front of the market table. I have noticed that Fogo's interior layout differs from one another, making the inside unique from city to city. Parking here is also easy to slide into.  We chose The Best of Brazil deal for $39 per person. Includes pork, pork ribs, sirloin, top sirloin, leg of lamb, sausage and chicken. Meat distributors are very prompt. The market table was good as usual. And our waitress checked on on us more than enough times, as did the manager. We were blessed with a complimentary desert of our choosing from the menu. We picked the molten chocolate cake. DivinExcellence. The perfect topper to our dinner, a rich chocolate cake accompanied by vanilla ice cream scoops.   An anniversary and money well spent at Fogo. Thanks to their staff for making it a memorable and fine experience!",

The staff was amazing and the food was even better.   The lamb chops are the best we have ever had and we have eaten at some of the swankiest restaurants in this town. The staff was so attentive they seemed to read our minds. From the moment we sat down our needs were met. My glass never went dry, we were visited by management to confirm our evening was enjoyable and the food did not disappoint. We will definitely return!",

The waiter explained the process and off we went!    The salad bar area was full of veggies, salads, cheeses and other goodies, but we were advised to save room for the plethora of meats to be served and we were certainly glad we did!  As soon as the coaster was flipped to green, servers with meat appeared at the table to load our plates.  The food was very tasty and the mashed potatoes, cheese rolls and banana/plantain sides served at the table were a great addition!    We mentioned to one of the servers that we were celebrating a birthday and we received a molten lava cake and ice cream with well wishes for the table to celebrate - nice touch!  The only part of the experience not as delightful was the bill - make sure to save up if you want to dine here, especially with a party of 5!  Nonetheless, we will definitely be back for another special occasion.",

    "text": "While visiting Vegas I knew I wanted to check out a Brazilian steakhouse since there aren't any in my city. Fogo de Chao was pretty close to our hotel, so a group of friends, my boyfriend and I all went to check it out on a Monday evening around 8 pm. We walked in and were seated right away. Someone came around showing a shrimp cocktail appetizer which we promptly ordered. Then you have access to the salad bar and unlimited meat cuts, served tableside and carved off giant skewers. They give you a little card with green on one side and red on the other, and the idea is to flip it to red once you're in the middle of eating or need a break. Flip it to green, and people will start stopping by again. The card didn't really work, as people kept coming over even when my card was red, or they'd go missing when all I really wanted was some sirloin. No real complaints about that, though because I never had to wait long for anything.  I just need to talk about the \"salad bar\" which is basically a mini Bellagio-style buffet in and of itself. There were lots of different salad options (not just boring garden and Caesar salads), charcuterie, assorted cheeses, an entire tray of sweet and spicy bacon, soups, smoked salmon, antipasti, fruit, vegetables, etc. It was amazing. I could have spent my entire visit just grazing off the salad bar!  The meat options included several cuts of sirloin, filet, ribs, pork sausage, bacon wrapped chicken breast, lamb, and chicken legs. The prime sirloin was my favorite (even if it was a bit overseasoned). The ribs and sausage were both dry, but the lamb and chicken were both awesome! For the most part everything was juicy and seasoned well. They also pass some sides at the table (polenta, cheese bread, roasted plantains and mashed potatoes). A manager kept stopping by to check on us and would ask if there was anything specific we were looking for. Very attentive without being obnoxious. Overall I was really happy with our visit but I don't know that I would go again now that I've experienced it. It's pretty pricey for regular visits (I believe it was about $70 per person).",

    "text": "Multinational churrascaria chain that summarizes Vegas in general pretty well at this location, which is a lot of price and several of the trappings of high end without ever quite going all the way over. They sort of gamely tried, but the salad bar (aside from the outstanding Italian meat selection) and sides were definitely second rate compared to several of the actual higher end places of this type I've been to. While their Pao de Queijo was acceptable, it was far from one of the better versions I've had of this. Same with their Brazilian lemonade and same with the Creme Brulee, but by that point, I wasn't really expecting anything other.   Service was mixed and I mention this because out of all of the trips to the table, easily 60 - 70% were offering the House Sirloin, which got to be fairly tiresome. They also did not have a lot of the usual staples I come to expect and anticipate and that was also annoying. Meats were fine, but there is more commonality in the flavoring and even how they cook it than not. No real complaints as to cooking style or flavor at all. It was all quite delectable, for the most part, but they could definitely use a much wider variety of meats. One would hope that the staff would gauge their offerings better, particularly for the expense, but that they do not because they are not forced to do so is perhaps more indicative of the cynicism pervasive in Vegas than anything else.",

    "text": "We came here for my birthday dinner the very last time we were in Las Vegas. We have been wanting to eat at Fogo for years - having gone to various Churrascaria's - such as Pampas and Texas de Brazil and the old one in Mirage when in Vegas; as well as various smaller ones throughout the country when we travel. But Fogo is the holy grail of Churrascaria's. Overall no major complaints - the restaurant is located off strip - not too far, but I would recommend taking an Uber or Lyft if you are staying on Strip and don't have a car. We stayed at Linq and it was a less than $10 Lyft returning home - it was still light out and we did walk there to build up an appetite - about 1 mile from the Linq.   We did make a reservation for a Thursday night but there was no need, the restaurant was far from packed and that being said, the service was pretty slow. We had to ask twice for our check, multiple times for water, etc... Whatever though - it is what it is. We did have a coupon since it was my birthday so I believe it was a buy 1 dinner get 1 dinner free - which was a steal! We were out the door with tip for like $75 (I believe it's $50 for dinner).   The review for the food - absolutely superb! I wouldn't necessarily say it's better than any of the other Churrascaria's we've been to - but we were not disappointed. The variety was wonderful and fresh and they were very attentive with bringing over meats that we wanted repeats of or had not yet seen. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is partially due to service, and partially due to the fact that they don't do pineapple! I would say EVERY Churrascaria we have ever been to includes grilled pineapple - not only to cleanse the palette but also as a dessert as it's usually grilled with cinnamon sugar, so that was the only main disappointment.   The side dishes - cheesy bread bites, mashed potatoes, rice, and grilled bananas were very good - no complaints here as well :) Will we be back? Meh - maybe, maybe not - with Pampas and the great groupons and coupons they have and their location on strip - we'd probably do that instead of going to Fogo - but that doesn't mean we'd rule it out in another city to try it out :)",

Don't be shy and use the red stop and green go card liberally to catch your breath between bites and visits from waiters with meat skewers who are at the ready to pile your plates.  All the meats cooked nicely with varying cook temps on their skewers (R, MR, M, etc..). The meats were well salted and had a nice fire grill crispness to the edges. Complimenting the cooked animal bonanza was a nicely assorted salad bar with all the fixings. Dessert is also very good here, my favorite is the flan.

    "text": "Great place to eat meat for special occasions! Probably not so much if you're vegetarian/vegan   Had the shrimp cocktail at the beginning of the meal that was offered - was it worth it? Eh. I'd probably save the room for the meats.  Tried several kinds of meats and I think my favorites were the garlic sirloin and the chicken leg.   Unfortunately, the 'flip the card to have meat served' system wasn't quite working here, at least for my table. Perhaps it was the location in which we were seated, but it seemed we were non-existent to the servers. The same servers would come by offering the same meats, but it took a bit of time to flag down the others we haven't tried. When we did get to try some cuts, they were sometimes no longer warm, understandably since the servers were walking around with them for a while.   If this is your first visit here and haven't ever tried the cheese puff bread, my tip for you is DON'T. These addicting little bastards had me reaching for them one after another. I prepared myself all day, having a small lunch and going for a long run to fill myself with all the meats. Unless you know you're going to be able to restrain yourself to a minimal amount of these puffs, just say no to these magical cheesy balls of puff.   On a more serious note, the service at this particular location was quite disappointing. We were often overlooked and it was an effort to have meats served, even to have a glass of water refilled.",

The hot dishes at the salad bar wasn't too fresh in my opinion, the Caesar salad was doused in dressing  which didn't leave it edible in my Opinion. The cocktails we're great, I had a premium signature cocktail (Brazilian specialty) and thought it was quiet delicious. Dessert was excellent.

I have to call the attention of the wait staff for help in cleaning our dirty plates.  I love the Filet Mignon, the Rib Eye and the Pork Ribs.  Nice selection of wine. Now the not so good: Salad bar can need a little improvement specially the Greens, they are soggy cause they already mixed the dressing. The fruit selection are of inferior in quality and taste and they need a little variety of bread. The plantain they put on our table were like mashed potato cause it was overripe but the polenta and the cheese bread were good. If you love meat you will like this place.",

Parking is never an issue, plenty of places to park. Also they provide valet parking for your convenience!  There is a nice bar area in the front before entering the restaurant. You can enjoy your favorite drink before lunch or dinner. Also, it's a unique viewing of the grilling of meats, with glasses around. A special way of making delicious food!  Love the authentic decorations! Modern with a twist of old! Dark wood carvings and leather seats.  Beautiful, fresh flowers all over the place. You can see trough the glasses of the walking vine cooler. Lots of vine to choose from!  The restaurant is divided into many different dining areas. It is convenient for business meetings, too!  Besides the original version of their dining experience, now individual items can be ordered. If you're not hungry enough to eat All You Can Eat meat and salad bar, it is optional to choose only the Market Table, for a lower price ... and also you can add one or two meat items. It is available for lunchtime, too! It's especially convenient, since the Market Table (salad bar) is $15 only. Plenty of vegetables, salads, fruits, cold meats, fish, cheeses, breads to choose from! Also, a delicious soup, too. Desserts and all drinks are for extra charge! (Sparkling water $7.50, other nonalcoholic beverages are $3.50)  The parmigiana cheese bread is so addicting! I can easily eat them all day! My friendly advice: please don't stuff your face with them if you want to enjoy the delicious meats! You're going to thank me later!  Also, don't forget to turn the round card (green for more meat; red for no more meat!)  Food and service are consistently awesome! We are going to enjoy many more delicious meals here!",

    "text": "This place was a pleasant surprise. I tend to shy away from Brazillian steakhouses for one main reason; I am extremely fussy about my cuts of meat. It is undoubtedly from my childhood, where my parents would by cheap, fatty/gristly cuts of meat, and make me so there until I cleaned my plate. So I developed such an aversion to fatty/gristly meat, that even as an adult, my gag reflex kicks in when I bite into a piece of meat, and am met with any kind of resistance. (OK, I am fully aware that this is an awful way to start a review of a steakhouse, but bear with me;) So given this parameter, I've probably only been to 2 of these meat-palaces in my entire adult life, (up until now) and neither was a good experience, so I just wrote them off as not-my-thing. So, last week, a business associate gave my wife a $100 gift card to Fogo, and we decided one night, what the heck, it's free, so we went, not expecting much at all. First, we got there early, probably around 5-ish on a week night, so there was no crowd, and no wait. Upon walking in, the hostess was very polite, attentive, and professional. We were seated quickly, interacting with a few different people, server, water guy, bread guy, drink lady, etc...and every one of them was more professional than the last. Just a top notch staff, which is becoming increasingly rare these days. Upon looking around, I noticed that the venue was huge, featuring 2-3 private dining rooms in addition to the main room that we were in. The next thing I noticed was that the whole place was immaculately clean, and tastefully decorated in warm woods. Somebody spent a fortune on this interior, most notably, the decorative use of wood in the ceiling treatment. Really pretty, and gave the room a friendly, inviting feel. It was explained to us that we could go enjoy the salad bar at our leisure, and when we were ready for meat service to start, simply flip our indicator over from the red side, to the green side, which will indicate to the servers to start bringing over meat to sample. We started with the salad bar, and I'm about to make a bold statement, but I dare say that this could be the best salad bar in all of Las Vegas. A large, classy, 4-sided bar, featuring an incredible assortment of very high-quality foods, creatively and tastefully displayed and prepared. I literally could have made this my entire meal, and did indeed contemplate it given my weird meat phobia, but decided When-in-Rome, and flipped my card to green, so beginning the meat service. There were probably 10-12 meat choices in all, and I'll admit that my choices were very conservative. I stuck mainly to lean beef choices like sirloin, 2 different types of filet, and a lean, center cut of ribeye. I carefully asked for very thin slices, and admittedly trimmed the fatty edges off, as I am programmed to do. But I must say, I ate a lot of meat that night, and everything I ate was flavorful, tender, juicy, and delicious. I cautiously avoided the lamb, sausage, and most other cuts that were foreign to me, but absolutely loved everything I ate. We didn't order dessert, but they brought us a complimentary flan anyway, which was so creamy, we ate the whole thing. I absolutely loved this place. I never would have come here if someone hadn't handed me a gift card, and now I'll certainly be back, so that was clever and effective marketing on someone's part. Kudos.",

The salad bar is incredible and quality (be sure to try the Kale and Mandarin Salad) although we restrain ourselves to leave enough room for the main reason for coming here. The magnificent meat selection and preparation was only outdone, this visit, by the service. The meats, the sides and even the dessert were excellent. The Flank Steak (as funny as that may seem) and the Flan were the clear winners of the night. Our server Diego, as well as the complete staff, made sure we wanted for nothing and had a tremendous experience.  At the onset, this may seem like a 'pricey' place but as I look back on several places in Vegas we've eaten and the cost of those meals the 'bargain' at this Fogo is an experience not to be missed! You will not be disappointed!",

We received dinner for 2 tickets to Fogo at my job's Christmas party, and decided to go last night. From the moment we parked the car, everything was great. The valet went out of his way to open the door for us, the ladies at the front were alert and greeted us promptly. Our wait staff were BEYOND polite, going out of their ways to pull out chairs for us, and constantly there to refill our plates. My husband and I don't drink alcohol, and didn't want soda with this meal. One of the gentlemen helping us offered a really yummy limeade that was soooo good! It was kind of creamy and frothy, and was amazing!! They said it was like a Brazilian limeade, which they made sure we had refills often. Everything was great. No complaints at all!",

    "text": "Before I start ripping this place for it's food, I have to give props where it's deserved!  This was some of the BEST service I've gotten in a restaurant. And that was the ONLY reason I considered giving Fogo a second star, but alas, well, the service and the pudim (or flan in english).  It was the BEST pudim that I've ever eaten outside of my Mom's home!!! And her pudim is to die for!  But the food, ahh the food, and the food was the reason for coming here right? Well the food,  let me see where do I start...  I have to highlight the fact that I really don't understand any of the previous reviewers that have written an opinion on this place, perhaps they just don't know any better, or the premise of the place \"clouds\" their taste buds.  Because this is without a doubt in my mind, the second worst Churrascaria Rodizio that I have EVER been to (the worst being a whole in the wall that used to exist in Honolulu, but has since closed (back in 08 or so..). It is important to salient the fact that I have been to several different Churrascarias in my life, throughout Brazil and the U.S. as well.  At the top of my list of good ones right now is Libra in Culver City, CA.    But I digress, I even tried to bring these facts to the manager, who at first tried to insinuate that I didn't know what I was talking about and became rather defensive, I understand, but customers concerns should be heeded, not argued about!  The manager being Brazilian, which I am also by heritage, however I do not carry an accent and while speaking English he simply saw me as a gringo, who doesn't know any better... But alas I explained the facts of life to him, after which he stated that the \"seasoning\" had to be what's-the-word-I'm-looking-for: toned down in order to appeal to the palates of all the tourists and etc...  This confession only came out after I named more than a few places that I had been to, the fact that despite being born in the US I had spent 14 years in country and knew the food well.  The conversation also took a turn to history of Brazil, not sure why he went there, but anyways, I followed, and in the end I got the \"truth\" out of him.  Which in his defense I found out that bland food is the norm in Vegas, blagh, I never tasted food so without \"life\", taste and soul than during my stay here...  We even went to the M Resort's Studio B buffet, again another disappointing meal: best meals? Secret Pizza and Sweet Tomatoes (yes, indeed!!!)  Nevertheless, I felt robbed in spending the amount of money that my wife and I did for a completely lackluster meal, that doesn't deserve any of the praises that have been sung previously!  The molho a campanha was the worst I've ever had, I actually enjoyed the chimichurri sauce, which was a little sacrilegious; the rice was dry as well as the black beans, the meat in general was lacking in the taste area, properly cooked, but not much flavor (they went too light on the sal grosso!), the buffet was bland in general and they did not have fries or onion rings (both traditionally present in similar buffets), only the polenta.  Overall I kept wishing I was back in LA at Libra!!!  Thank you for reading, and I hope I can help by saving others from this place!!!",

    "text": "Came here on 24 Jun 2012, here is my review for each specific area I'm rating it against, now keep it mind this is on a high cost end and if people are paying this much then food quality and service should be commensurate.   Service: It was okay service overall, nothing over-the-top. Attentive staff, however, except when I asked one of the waiter if they had salmon he said they do but it was only smoke.   Food: it was average overall, the cold cuts, rice, beans and other items on buffet line was good but nothing to rave about.  Meat: this is suppose to be their best selling point, but I think this is where they failed bad and I thought that they were giving people low bang for the buck. Here is what I mean, first, there was only a few choices of meat compare to some Brazilian restaurant we've been to here in Vegas. Second, when they started going around, they start you and fill you up with cheap cuts, like for example chicken and then some sausage. Then they follow it up with top sirloin, I mean I didn't even see the lamb of leg or prime rib until the end, which I was already full. Third, there was no fish on the menu.  Location: being close to the Strip can mean bad and good, good because you will get more tourist customers. Bad, because when you go out for a nice dinner wearing decent clothes, you should at least expect to see people wearing similar clothing. When we were there we had a group of tourist that looked like they just came back from playing basketball, sleeveless shirt and spandex shorts, and this is supposed to be fine dining?? What a joke!  Now I can't help it but compare this to Via Brasil because I think Via beats this place hands down.  Via Brasil is a bit farther out from the strip, we've been there at least 4 times and all those times we've never seen anyone dress like a yoohoo! I think that the location speaks for itself as well, more middle-classs to wealthy neighborhood nearby so you always see Ferraris/Maserati park upfront. No tourist to deal with really!  The service is way better, they have a waiter/waitress looking at your table the whole time to ensure you don't run out of things. When you are done with your plate, they even take it away and clean/brush crumbs off of your table and gives you a new plate while you are just seating down.  Food: this is where it hit the mark for me, they have more meat selection(just compare both meat menu please) to add, Via has Salmon on Cedar planks, this is my wife's favorite. On one Friday night, they even had one whole roasted pig on a cart wheeled around, what a delicious treat.  Overall, if I am paying this much then I think food quality/service should be commensurate. Go to Via Brasil and you'll know what I'm talking about!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying Texas de Brazil is 100x better, having eaten at a few buffet style steak houses this is definitely one of the worst (flavor wise). By all means if you want good service and cheerful staff this is your place, but be prepared to actually eat at the salad bar. Let's just say we ate salads afterwards because we were still hungry. We couldn't eat anymore unflavored highly  fatty meat any longer.   We couldn't even eat the \"garlic\" mashed potatoes mostly because they tasted like instant potatoes. Texas De Brazil is brazillion times better!! Ps the manager was super creepy!!!!",

    "text": "Nice Brazilian Churrascaria  in Vegas.  I have been to 3 churrascaria's in my life (although multiple times to each one) and I have to say, the other two both had better meat than Fogo. This is not to say that the meat at Fogo isn't good, just that the meat at the others is better.  Fogo DEFINITELY had better service than the other two however, and it's not even close! As soon as we turned the disc over to green (which means bring me meat) we were swarmed with more meat that you could ever ask for. Often at the other churrascaria's we have had to wait for meat, or wait for a specific meat. Not here. If your disc is green they are right there immediately to give you your fill.  Their salad bar was very good as well including an amazing apple salad I considered asking if they sold to go, it was so good   But if you go to a churrascaria you aren't there for salad, you are there for the meat. The sirloin was the best of the meats. The bacon wrapped filet was tasty but the cut of meat wasn't great. The Brazilian sausage was a little disappointing compared to other places, but was still good. The chicken was again, not as good as the other places, but still tasty.  Based on just the food I would give them 3 stars, but the services definitely upped the rating to 4 stars.  Oh, I also had the Brazilian lemonade which was incredible. Not at all what you would expect when someone says lemonade. It was lime and milk based, but was very light and refreshing. Their sodas come in bottles with no free refills so I tried the \"lemonade\" instead which does have refills. Glad I did too, because it was fantastic.",

    "text": "Of the Brazilian restaurants in Las Vegas Texas De Brazil wins in the battle against Fogo De Chao, Pampas and Via. Fogo De Chao is still good- I personal like Texas better and this is why:  The salad bar at Texas has more options including two different types of mushrooms on hot and one marinated and cold, Fogo just has the cold ones. Texas has a variety of cheeses to include goat cheese and crostini toast, which Fogo does not. Fogo has bread for the cheese which is fine but I am spoiled by the options at Texas. Texas has two types of asparagus white and green and a delicious Quinoa salad. The main difference however is Texas de Brazils potatoes- their potato salad is better and the also offer scalloped potatoes and lobster bisque which Fogo does not.  Sides: Fogo offers polenta fries which are delicious something Texas does not have, however Texas mashed potatoes beat Fogos hands down any day of the week. When we got the potatoes at Fogo the server was like \"and our delicious garlic potatoes\". now if you are a potato snob like I am you can tell by visual appearance alone if potatoes are from a package- which these were. The consistency was watery and tasted like instant. BUMMER. Texas however, and I say this every time I eat there has the best mashed potatoes! They are so creamy, smooth and delicious. The plantains are equal at both places. Cheese bread- actually I think Fogo  wins on the cheese bread, but Texas is still good.  Meat: Both are equal- I personally think Texas might be seasoned a little better- my friend said that she thought Texas meat was a little more salty.   Service: both places have EXCELLENT service. You will feel welcomed and full. Fogo was extremely prompt. I didnt even notice my friend had flipped her card from Red to Green and the server was already bring us our hot sides and  meat was coming our way- my friend said it was like they heard the air as the card flipped over.   Finally- Price Fogo is a little more expensive. If your just doing salad bar go to Texas I think light lunch there is $19.99 and Fogos is $24.99 full lunch at texas is $26.99 and Fogo is $29.99. Dinner both are around $50.   Side note: When I walked into Fogo's I was hit with the overwhelming smell of meat- which I actually did not enjoy that almost turned me off- There is no meat smell at Texas. Try both see which you like- but personally Ill be at Texas for my Brazilian feasting!!",

I really enjoyed the traditional Brazilian side dishes. Especially the Pao de Queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta (basically polenta fries), and caramelized bananas. Their salad bar is wonderful! I enjoyed some aged Manchego cheese, Prosciutto, Artichoke Hearts, Smoked Salmon, Italian Salami, Asparagus, broccoli, etc. We tried almost all the different cuts of meat they offer. The Picanha (their signature steak, prime cut of top sirloin. ), Filet Mignon, Filet Mignon wrapped in Bacon, Linguica (sausage), Lombo (pork loin), Costela de Porco (pork ribs), Cordeiro (lamb chop), Alcatra (special cut of top sirloin), and Frango (chicken) wrapped in Bacon. For dessert, I got their Signature Papaya Cream.  I'm assuming because they were busy and overwhelmed, I was passed frequently even with the green side showing on my card. I had to flag down our server a couple times to ask him to bring specific cuts that we wanted. Gratefully, our server was awesome and very attentive. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy any of the cuts. Some were cooked more to my liking (medium rare to rare), but I received a lot of overdone and dry cuts (especially the chicken, blah) and the filet wrapped in bacon was disappointingly overdone as well. I know it's not made-to-order and \"buffet\" style, but I didn't enjoy the meat as much as I feel I should have and the green/red card was useless!",

The sides and salad bar have tons of fresh veggies, imported/gourmet cheeses, cured meats, and various Brazilian style side dishes.  Let's just say there are a ton of great options to start with so definitely start by grabbing a plate here.    They have these cards on the table with one side green (go-feed me more) and the other side red (stop-I'm full or need a break).  Flip your card over to green and the chefs start to serve you fresh cuts of meat that are brought to your table and sliced right onto your plate.  Choose from chicken (even bacon wrapped chicken!), beef (at least 3 different kinds), pork, sausage links, and they even have lamb.  When you are satisfied then flip your card back to red.    I'm always so full that I don't have room for desert but one of these days I'm gonna try the Molten Chocolate Cake!  The table next to us ordered it and I was literally drooling.

Let's just say the experience here did not disappoint. The staff was very attentive, pleasant, and professional. We had some wonderful conversations with two managers who also provided some excellent suggestions for us as we sampled the various meets that were brought to the table. My wife and I hardly ever eat lamb, but we decided to try out the lamb T-bone which one manager said was fairly new to the menu. I didn't think I would like it but it's was very flavorful. I realized to late that I should have asked for smaller portions when sampling most of the meats. Once I figured out which meats I enjoyed most, I could request those meats again and again to be brought to our table. Unfortunately I got stuffed before I could follow that plan. Stuffed on sampling the various meats and stuffed on the other stuff like salads, cheese, peppered maple beacon strips, grilled veggies, and so on. If you enjoy eating great cuts of meat, don't fill up on the other stuff. If you never give something a try, how will you ever know if you like it or not... take the chance and you might be surprised...",

I was a little surprised when we arrived at the Las Vegas Fogo De Chao, as it was almost 8 PM on a Friday night and the parking lot was more than half empty. I had been thinking for a long time, that Las Vegas really needed a Fogo De Chao, but apparently not everyone agrees, as the restaurant itself was only half full. Is this because of the cost of dining here, or perhaps there are so many good dining choices in Las Vegas including several other excellent churrascarias? I don't know, but it was not because the food was not excellent because it was.   Having been to the Chicago and Beverly Hills locations, I knew what to expect, and I was not disappointed, the cuts of meat were as delicious as at their other locations, the caipirinha were perfectly prepared. My favorite cut, the sirloin cap picanha was superb, I think I had 6 or 8 servings of this. The lamb chops were divine, bacon wrapped filet and chicken yummy, various other cuts of sirloin, rib eye, filet all outstanding. Service was good on this visit, but not great, we did at one point have to wait for a second round of drinks.   What else can you say, but an endless delivery of the freshest tastiest meat cuts, prepared exactly as you wish them, cut for you off the skewer by the gaucho servers, it doesn't get any better than this. One tip, you can overdo the salad bar, which is very good, and short yourself some space to fit MORE MEAT, so go easy on the front end.   Recommended, for those with no dinner budget ( base cost per person for the dinner buffet is now $49.50 plus tax, tip and drinks) and a taste for all things cow, pig lamb and chicken!",

The side dishes - plantain awesome, mashers above average, rice so-so but the cheese bread was to die for!  about 15 choices of BBQ protein circulating throughout the store.  Service was on-point and the price for lunch was a steal (even in Vegas)!",

Amongst the other succulent meats they had to offer. This restaurant is amazing and truly worth every cent. It's hard to find such great tasting food to go along with amazing customer service.  If heaven had a taste, it would be similar to that of the Picanha. The juiciest, most flavorful meat that I have ever tasted. I have dreams of that Picanha and I can not wait until we meet again. The Seafood tower was also very tasty. This a must try spot if you're a tourist.However, I guarantee you this is a secret that will be leaving Vegas.",

The filet was extremely chewy, the bananas were hard and flavorless, the first round of parmesan pork was nasty the second was much better and each time I asked for it medium-medium well it came back super charred to where I couldn't even eat it!  I can't believe I spent $80, not including tip, to eat this! The service was just ok that's why I gave them 2 stars the food would be a 0! The gentleman that was there for our last 10 minutes got us the waters and check very quickly and was on things but other than that the ladies chatted amongst themselves near the salad bar and took my plate without bringing me another. Oh and no mints or chocolates out front like they always had!! Sad to see it go downhill",

Got Brunch pricing :( forgot Sundays means Brunch not Lunch 5mns away from the strip  Parking space is large. When we walked to the restaurant someone Opened it for us and then the host took us to a table right away. The room was little too dark, restaurant was elegant. The person in charge of our table \"introduced us\" to the Brazilian BBQ. Glasses of water got served couple minutes later. The \"salad bar\" was ok. I Love that they had fresh cuts of fruits like papaya, pineapple, fresh berries! that was a YEAHHH  The selection wasn't as festive as Texas De Brazil. Then the ballet of meats arrived. Their sausage were Yummy and I got the Filet Mignon and some lamb shop. Meat was juicy and good per my mom :) I wasn't impressed by it, I feel like the choice was \"limited\".  What was the Best to me Your meal will be serviced with fried bananas (was perfectly fried and sweet little caramelized no sugar added or cinnamon), fried polenta, mashed potato, cheese puff  Fresh fruits cuts EXCELLENT  Party of 4, $211 on a Sunday brunch... I tried but my heart stuck with Texas De Brazil",

Yes it's a little $$ but you wanna eat good or you wanna eat some cheap mediocre stuff on the strip somewhere??  Worth every penny and I would definitely go again. HOUSE SPECIAL ROAST IS THE BEST!!! All the meats were so good i stopped trying to remember the names. Basically everything was tender and melted in my mouth like butter. Who needs knives to cut when it's that tender??  Customer service: they treat you like royalty here. They even brought out a dessert for my boyfriend and it was the best tres leches cake I've ever had   TLDR, must come here. May not be a typical Vegas buffet but it's way better. I almost cried in the middle of my meal cuz I was in meat heaven.",

Ribeye, sausage, chicken, pork, ribs. Everything but the bathroom sink...served by handsome staff. Food for your eyes as well!  Located a few minutes away from the MGM, Fogo is its own, stand alone restaurant. As soon as we entered, we were immediately seated. If you have Open Table, reserve your seat and earn points.  We were served yummy house cheese-like bread balls. So good! I could eat them all day. They're crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Don't get too stuffed though!  In the center of the restaurant there's an island with plates, salad, starches, and soup. You can go up and grab as you like.  As you dine, the staff walk the floor with spits filled with meat. My favorite was the ribeye. It was so flavorful and moist! As we were dining, they also brought us grilled plantains and mashed potatoes.  Overall, the food and service was amazing. I'd highly recommend going to Fogo!",

I felt like the servers that is going around serving the meat should be attentive to the customers in the restaurant. For example if a server have food being administered to one table and right behind him is another table with the green card up he should be more attentive and ask that person at the next table if they would like the same meat that's been served. The service should not come with an attitude or a stated answer saying that the customer at the table had requested a certain item or he/she put in a special request for a particular meat. If the special request was given to the person I believe with all fairness the server should turn around and ask the customer if they would want to have a slice of that particular meat item as well. People be more attentive to the customers when you are serving them. The waitress should check on the customers more often as well.",

I went to Fogo on my birthday last Thursday night.  Our server was decent but extremely hard to understand.  The buffet style food was just OK.  The selection wasn't as comprehensive as TX De Brazil, nor was it as tasty.  The meat was a bit of a let down too.  The only thing that stood out was the bacon wrapped filet and everything else was just mediocre.  The meal was also very expensive.  For four of us and only 2 of us got a drink, it was around $250 dollars.    The ambience was a bit disappointing too.  In my opinion, it is a step down from Texas De Brazil.",

The salad bar table was yummy full of different and unique flavors like a pear and goat cheese salad,salami, chicken salad and salmon. Many choices to choose from. I enjoyed the passion fruit caiprhina. Really fantastic drink that had muddled limes and passion fruit. We came for lunch and received a complimentary card for another visit. What a steal, I didn't even know that was going on. The meat ofcourse was a 10z I was not a fan of the filet it was very fatty but seriously the sides the cheese bread it was all amazing!!! I will definitely be coming back to enjoy this place",

We were seated promptly although we did not have a reservation for a Saturday night. The server was very helpful and made sure we are doing good and have what we want. The meats were delicious and we were getting service faster than we could finish what we just cut. I docked a star because of the salad bar. It did not have enough variety and the mushrooms were pickled just too much:( I LOVE mushrooms and I was looking forward for that in the salad bar and also it was missing dried tomatoes and basil. Maybe I just got use to the Brazilian place in San Diego but it was good overall !",

We go to Las Vegas once a year for a line dance convention in November and we are already talking about our next reservations to Fogo de Chao in 2018. The food was absolutely delicious.      The staff was so much fun. Make sure you ask them questions. Keith the server who seated us was great. He got us started. Jose Ruiz was at our table talking about the restaurant and letting us know about how things work. He was super customer service representative.      The food was amazing and the drinks were pretty good also. Go hungry and start slow and pace yourself. You won't miss out on anything because they just keep bringing out meat right off the open pit oven. Make it a evening and not a quick dinner. It is not cheap but a great dining night.    A great dining experience.    Thanks Fogo de Chao",

I've had better Brazilian steak houses in Las Vegas before. The lamb was very gamey  and not that tender. The best meat available was the filet very tender and cooked perfectly. Skip the filler meats like the skirt steak it's tough and very salty and nothing special.   The mash potatoes that come with the meal was good nicely buttered russet verity. The popover rolls were delicious so buttery and flaky good. The salad/appetizer buffet was disappointing the line was mega long for mediocre buffet salads. The wine list was nice with a great variety the prices were slightly above average for a bottle of wine.   Service was good the meats kept on coming around frequently and you can request a favorite cut and temperature of the meats as well.",

Twice I have been here and they seat is at the door of the toilet and kitchen. TWICE!  That is the noisiest place to be and were there for a business meeting party if none!  The table was nearly too small.   I would have complained and had us moved but I was a guest and not the paying person so I did not make a scene.   I did quietly speak to the manager. No real answer. And it was only 30% full when we were seated and 60% full when we left.   But alas. They no longer serve the wheel of gran padano cheese. Said something about it being in the open and not healthy as everyone can touch it. Ummm the entire salad bar is the same....  Still a great place. But average excuses!",

I smoke meat frequently, I eat at Brazilian steakhouses as often I my health can afford, and exercise frequently to justify the habit.  I think I can say with some authority that the meat here is well worth your time. They have a huge selection and you rarely have time to work on your salad options between a new skewer of meat being presented. The good news is that if meat is the reason you're here, this is exactly what you want. If that isn't the reason, you might want to choose another option.  That being said, the desserts were fine but nothing impressive. The salad bar was also okay. I wasn't really there for those things, so it didn't bother me. Only improvement I would have looked for would have been roasted pineapple like I've seen and enjoyed at similar Brazilian steakhouses. It was certainly worth the money, though!",

Now onto the service and the food.  Food was what u expected it to be. The guys walked around with different cuts of meat and it was pretty decent. But the kicker was that i was asking for medium to mid rare and they were giving me well done pieces at the beginning. Once i started to decline certain cuts and specify again and again i wanted some red in the center... They started giving me more of the \"pinker\" stuff. And then one of the guys started to explain to me in a not so friendly manner that medium and rare were two different things.... And i told him again.... Something in between medium and mid rare.... And he still didn't get it and have me a well done piece of meat.... So totally annoyed!!!  Meat (3/5.... 3 just because my last piece of meat i got there was perfect). The salad bar was their normal spread... Decent. (4/5) the cheesy puffs... Or whatever they are called...omg...i could've eaten just those and i would've been happy....lol (5/5)  Service... Was eh....i had to flag down people constantly. First they forgot my bf's coke.... Then the guys with meat were just passing us by even though my little card was on green! Then we had to flag down another person to get a refill on our water and cokes.... Then we had to flag down another person to get our checks... Are you getting my drift? Yeah there was alot of me craning my neck to try and capture people's eyes to get service. (1/5)  Then the kicker to the entire meal was that the manager basically lied to me. Before we were even seated...i asked about their \"summer feast\" which is a discounted price for lunch and dinner but you have to ask for it before you sit down... Which is what i did. The manager nodded his head and said they were running it. Well when the check came, the price was the full amount. So i mentioned it to the server and he took it away and said that he would ask the manager. The manager didn't even have the decency to stop by the table to explain it himself... The server had to explain and say that it is only for dinner. So if that is the case... Why did the manager nod and say yes at the beginning??? On top of all the craning to get people's attention and the lies at the end... Leaving here with a not so good taste in my mouth so hence the 2 stars....  Most likely if i do want fogo de chao again....i would definitely recommend passing on this location up for their other location summerlin.... Or maybe just going to Texas de Brazil.",

    "text": "Great service. Awesome hostess, servers and everything!  90% of the time, the meat comes out piping hot, which are all delicious. Their signature meat, picanha is extremely delicious. I probably get 9-12 slices of this fatty, crispy and well-marinated cut every time I go. Tip: Get 1-2 slices at a time and get your second (or third) servings when they come around again. Meat gets cold quick and these delicate cuts are best when served hot.  My partner and I celebrated our anniversary here and the team did everything to make it an extremely pleasant and awesome memory. From the moment we sat down, we were quickly greeted and congratulated about our special day. Service was super responsive and they took care of everything from replacing our appetizers to refilling our drinks in a timely manner. At the end of our meal, we even got a delicious dessert complimentary of the team at the restaurant. Talk about great service!   The salad bar is also well-maintained. Nothing too special or crazy about it - just make sure not to get full off of it!   Overall, I'd highly reccomend this place for anyone interested in trying out Brazilian BBQ! It's an awesome way to dine and it's pretty fun! It's on the pricey side, which shouldn't surprise you about Fogo De Chao (or Brazilian BBQ) for that matter. I heard lunch is a bit more affordable if you're on a budget.   Come here. You won't regret it.",

And you can't go wrong with any of their beef selections :)  Wednesdays have half off wine bottles which are a really good deal.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  My MAIN gripe with Fogo is the fact that they charged us for a birthday cake that we didn't order. My girlfriend used her $25 gift card that she received from Fogo for her birthday which they assumed meant we wanted cake? Then they even charged us for the cake that we didn't order? It's borderline fraud to be charging a customer for something they DIDN'T ask for. If you want to give us cake because it's our birthday celebration, it should be on the house. Don't just put it on our tab and charge us!! I am giving Fogo a bad rating because they were underhanded by doing that. I am willing to change my rating if they correct this.",

I've been meaning to try Fogo in Beverly Hills but never got around to it. So when i was in Vegas for a convention, I decided to give it a try.  And I wasn't that impressed.  The service was fantastic and the meat quality was top notch.  But it wasn't that much better than say, Agora Churracaria, M Grill, or Libra.   The feijao (black beans) was not that flavorful, the vinagrete (pico de gallo) was way too vinegary, the collard greens were not that well flavored or cooked, and they didn't have watercress, which is my favorite veggie.    I know you go for the meat, but these side dishes are crucial to my enjoyment and I expected top notch everything for  a place that charges top notch prices.  I guess I have to try the Beverly Hills location for a final verdict, but I'm not sure if it's going to be worth paying 30 more dollars for Fogo over places like Agora, M Grill, or Libra.",

Well he wasn't kidding, the second we had a green card we were being served, it was fabulous.  The side dishes were great, ranging from cheesy bread, friend polenta, garlic mashed, and a banana dish.  The salad bar was to die for, but don't fill up too much there-as hard as it is to resist.  I had a mango fresca cocktail that was delicious, and my boyfriend had the brazilian beer they had on tap, which he said resembled the taste of a guinness beer. Yum!  The wait staff is very attentive and make sure to cater to your every need, refilling your drinks constantly, bringing your new plates as you request them, and refilling your side dishes if you have room for more.  We really enjoyed our dining experience here and we will be back soon! Highly recommended for any special occassion dinner or when you need to go on a carnivore rampage.",

    "text": "The s/o and I have been to several Brazillian steakhouses, including Texas de Brazil, Pampas and a few located in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I've heard of Fogo de Chao for several years, but there was never a convenient location until I realized there's now a location in Vegas so, we had to check it out.  Very typical setup as the other steakhouses we've been to, as it features a buffet of various salads, cheese, cured meats, and a few hot items such as rice, potatoes and vegetables.  They also serve you a plate of plantains, fried polenta and mashed potatoes...the instant kind, not real mashed potatoes, for the price you'd pay you'd think they wouldn't skimp on quality.  The saving grace was their cheese bread, it was seriously the BEST cheese bread from a Brazillian steakhouse we've had!  What nice is that they'll refill it with a piping hot batch on request.  They had a variety of about a dozen or so meats, varying from the traditional Picanha (Top Sirloin), Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, Sausage, Chicken wrapped in Bacon, and other cuts of Sirloins.  They also had a Rib of Beef, which is served cut from a cutting board but you have to specifically request it as it's not an item that they walk from table to table.   First off, avoid the sausage and even the chicken, you can eat that anytime, anywhere.  If all you eat is the Rib of Beef, do it, it's the only super darn delcious cut of meat they offer!  With that said, yeah, the cuts of the various beef were lacking in flavor, I almost wanted to ask for steak sauce.  Unlike other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, FdC did not serve Grilled Pineapple...if you haven't had it, you're seriously missing out, it just makes you enjoy the various meats even more.  My biggest gripe about FdC was the ambiance.  It was a nice, typical white linen type of steakhouse.  However, although I do understand the \"meat guys\" as I call them are running around from table to table, there were just way too many wait staff walking around.  It made the dining experience slightly unnerving that you'd get bumped into (which I did), get something spilled on you (almost happened, but observed it happening on the dining room floor, twice) and just sheer pandamonium.  It seriously was like a sea of people dressed in white shirts running around like chickens without heads.  We've never experienced that at any Brazillian steakhouse we've been to.  There was even a guy pushing a cart of liquor from table to table, which added to the chaos.  When we got our check, we skipped using the plastic, left cash instead and seriously beelined out of there.  Sorry, can't say we'll be back.",

I came here for date night and had a great time. Our server was really friendly and explained how the the steakhouse worked as far as meats and the salad bar. Each of the meat servers is actually a gaucho chef. I think our server said there were 18 of them. That means each of the gentlemen bringing you meat and carving it for you is actually the person preparing it as well. That was impressive and nice to know.   As far as the food, some of the meats were hit or miss for me.  The sausage was just meh, the bottom sirloin was a bit salty, but the picanha, alcatra, and parmesan crusted pork loin were so delicious.  Most of the meats were juicy but had a perfect fire roasted char on the outside. YUM.  I know they have several areas they can convert to private rooms for functions or larger groups.  I talked to the service manager and he let me know there's no fee to rent a room and they can even split everyone's check individually in a party.  I'm definitely thinking about doing my graduation party here with my family and friends!",

The meat was tender, flavorful, and delectable, and when I say never-ending, I'm not lying. This staff is a well-oiled machine here, as well as being super friendly and attentive. I can't say enough about our experience. I would go back in a heartbeat and highly recommend to others.

Jonathan, Mike & I casually strolled up to their salad bar-1st thing to do after being seated. We didn't get too much since we knew the main attraction would be coming at us, at our table, in waves-juicy morsels of meat....!!! I always asked for the medium/rare cuts and was well accommodated.

The roasted garlic and pickled onions went great with the meat.  The lamb was my favorite the filet mignon not as tasty as the other cuts of beef.",

Unlike many other Brazilian BBQ places, their cuts of meat are always of the highest quality and cooked perfectly. While their salad bar is not the biggest (I'm not here for that anyway), the items they have are tasty and fresh. The side dishes they serve (cheese rolls, mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, and caramelized bananas) are all delicious.  I highly recommend their picanha (top sirloin), parmesan pork loin, filet mignon, and their chicken. All of the meats are cooked to perfection and served to your liking (in terms of doneness).  The servers are attentive and make sure that you have what you need. I really appreciate that they will ask if there is a particular meat you would like. All in all, they provided us with a wonderful dining experience.",

The service was almost too good in that we had like 5 servers standing around waiting on us. Their hot items are delish and meat is not as salty.

The salad bar had a beautiful appeal on the eye, offering fresh crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, peppers, tabouli salad, potato salad cheeses, roasted red potatoes and much more ! Great place to go for a nice romantic dinner or bring a large group. If you love meats, you absolutely have to come here ! And as a special bonus, the service was 5 Stars as well. The wait staff and \"Gouchos\" were so helpful and  attentive to my family we wanted for nothing. Our drinks were always full and every request was fulfilled quickly, with enthusiasm and a smile. I highly recommend visiting while in Vegas !",

A bountiful selection of deli meats, salmon, cheeses, salads, pasta, veggies.  Everything was as delicious as it was beautiful.  Be careful not to load up on the salad bar though because waiting for you at your table is mashed potatoes, fried bananas, fried polenta and the tastiest cheese rolls I like to call pillows of evil.  But wait, there's more.  The star of the show at Fogo de Chao is the amazing selection of meats that is served tableside.  I love the two sided coasters that signaled to the meat guys whether or not we wanted meat service.  Dinner was better than I could have ever imagined an AYCE could be!  You don't even have to get up and get your food.  If you love meat, this is definitely the place to check out.  Service was also top notch!

I found it irritating that no one in party had their indicator turned to green at the same time, so we constantly had servers at our table which interrupted our conversations and left me feeling crowded.  For that price, we would have preferred having a good steak at Gallagher's or Twin Creeks.  Two people had the meals, dessert, one soda and two cocktails, with tip the bill was $192.",

The salad bar has plenty of fresh, tasty greens as well as other side items, such as smoked salmon, prosciutto, steamed potatoes, beans, rice, etc. However, what really makes this place shine is the assortment of tasty meats their staff brings to your table (if you turn your coaster over to the green side). There are just too many of them to name individually, but one item in particular was the bacon-wrapped turkey. Just... out of this world, hands down. The only real drawback is the price per person of $51.50 (to be fair, it IS an upscale restaurant on Flamingo/Paradise), but it's not too bad if you are fairly well-off or you only go out to eat once or twice a month. It is guaranteed that I will be returning here on one of my next dinner dates.",

The service is great, the meat comes in a wide variety, from sirloin to filet mignon, from lamb chops to lab of lamb, it truly is a carnivores paradise. First time I went there, I was in awe at the selection; soo many choices! Second time I went there, I tried the salad bar, and wow is it nice!  However, my problem with the place came with my third visit...the bartender didn't seem competent at his job and made my friend and her mom and dad some terrible tasting Caipirinhas (three different ones). Via Brazil wins in this category.  Overall, fogo is excellent, will most definitely come back...but I won't be ordering a Caipirinha if that same bartender is there (or hasn't learned how to make drinks properly).",

I don't really like that. You already get all you can eat meat so you don't need the shrimp. The rolls were delicious and I asked for grilled pineapple and it was delicious. The chicken was more flavorful than my local brazilian steakhouse and the salad bar and mashed potatoes were good. I also enjoyed the fried polenta.  Good variety of steaks but I didn't like how they were cooked..either burnt or raw. However my husband and daughter liked their steak choices. Approx $55.00 per person for all you can eat salad and meat, $21 for the shrimp cocktail, and $5.50 for a bottle of beer. The service was fantastic but didn't make up for my mediocre steak.",

We took relatives here for lunch and they were so impressed that when they got home, they drove almost two hours to dine at their closest Fogo.  I do have my favorite Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago, which I consider a 5-star. Fogo is close to my favorite, pretty close! I have been to really bad Braz Steakhouses too, where the meat was dry and old. Fogo was definitely not that, the meat is always juicy and the choices are amazing.  The salad bar is a \"be careful\" zone. It's so good you have to be careful not to fill up before the meat and sides come. Our guest mentioned she would have been happy just with the salad bar, she was so impressed.   Kids really love Brazilian steak houses. They love watching their meat choices being slid off of big swords. Their eyes light up when they see servers walking around with long swords of meat. I'm sure there are a lot of adults who get that same thrill as well.   Fogo de Chao is definitely a carnivore's haven!",

I'm glad that I made reservations 2-3 weeks in advanced, because once we arrived, there was a line out of the door! We approximately arrived at Fogo de Chao at 7:15 PM and had reservations at 7:30 PM. The wait wasn't bad... we maybe waited 15-18 minutes before we were directed back to our table.   Although Fogo de Chao was BUSY, the service was still amazing! The food was delicious! Samson was our waiter and he took very good care of us. He was attentive and made surprisingly good small talk with my husband and I. Since it was my husband's birthday, Samson gave my husband a complimentary dessert. In addition to that, Samson presented us with a complimentary lunch or dinner card for dinning in on Valentine's Day.   Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and planning our next trip to Vegas to eat here again!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I had reservations and was late and they were more than accommodating. The salad bar has a great selection from meats and cheese to soups and various mixed greens salad, the one downfall is that I have a tomato allergy and I cannot have anything that has touched tomatoes and all of the salads already have them mixed in. I ordered a plate of plain lettuce so I could build my own salad, which was a little hard for the waiter to understand. After clarifying three times he brought me exactly what I wanted (see attached photos). The meat on a stick is cool, especially since they bring the meat when it is cooked at different levels. So you can order different types of meat the way you prefer them cooked. I would recommend not ordering anything well done it will be too dry. I do not eat pork and there were a few things I would have tried it they were not wrapped in bacon. My significant other said that the Parmesan pork and the garlic top sirloin were the best dishes. I had the super fruit lemonade and it was one of the strongest drinks I have had in Vegas. The service was great everyone was very attentive. Even when our cards were not flipped up to get more meat. The best part of our meal were the  deserts. I had the tres leches cake which from my understanding is a new recipe. We also had the key lime pie which was delicious. The dessert was way better than we had predicted. Before they closed they let us know they would be closing the market salad bar to ensure that everyone got all they wanted. I am giving 4/5 stars because I didn't have any meat that I thought was outstanding it all tasted the same to me.",

Once we flipped the card to green, meaning we wanted meat, we had about 6 different types of meat that came to our table in less than 5 minutes! I have to admit, I was a little overwhelmed and wanted to try them all. If you don't see the meat you like floating around somewhere on a stick, let a waiter know and they'll find it for you. For us, we kept asking, \"where's the lamb?\" (It was THAT good!)   Fogo de Chao has an extensive wine selection and the soft drinks actually came in glass bottles -- which I found interesting. Location is about 5-10 minutes from the strip and is well worth the price!",

Ricci also made the decision easy for us with her responsiveness, professionalism, friendliness, and eagerness to make our wedding reception go perfectly.  Fogo de Chao will have 3 options for your guests depending on how much alcohol you will want to serve. There will be a no-alcohol option, a 2-drinks-prepaid-per-person option with desserts and coffee (about $117/per head after taxes and gratuity), and an open bar option. We went with the middle option for 46 guests, and hosted a full-on reception with dancing, a DJ, an impersonator entertainer, and dinner and dessert.   Working with Ricci, we were able to pick the perfect room size. You have to ensure a minimum amount paid for food depending on the room you pick. For us with just under 50 people and needing room for a dance floor and the DJ, the room fitting 60-80 people was the right size. We didn't have to pay extra for the extra room - 46 guests was enough to cover the price.  Ricci spent hours on the phone with me as I went back and forth between her and the DJ she suggested to us to ensure that the timeline and plan were all set. She was so patient and professional and made us feel confident and assured throughout the whole process.  Now, to the food. If you have ever eaten at Fogo de Chao, you know very well that the wait staff dressed as Gauchos are very attentive to whether or not you're \"green\" or \"red.\" For those who have never been to Fogo de Chao, the way it works is, gauchos come around with all sorts of meats-- filet mignon, NY strip, bacon-wrapped pork, roasted chicken, sirloin, \"Brazilian style\" steak, etc.. Meanwhile, the diners have a flip card with red for \"don't come and give me meat right now\" and green for \"please come over here with that spear of meat you have.\" The gauchos then slice a portion of the meat on their skewer onto the diners' plate.   This is in addition to a buffet-style market table which has soups, salads, and side dishes. The diners get to choose one dessert among several options including NY cheesecake, chocolate cake, and creme brulee.   Amazingly, at my own wedding, I was able to try several of the desserts in addition to a cappuccino, and it was all so very delicious. Everyone raved about the deliciousness of the food. I think people were so caught up in the deliciousness of the food that they didn't drink much because we were well under the 2-drink-per-person limit. I wish I wasn't so busy entertaining and got to be a guest!  The only shortcoming was the lack of options for our 3 vegan guests. Indeed, the wait staff was very attentive to their needs, but I was told by the guests a month later that, well, the market table wasn't too accommodating to them since everything from the vegetables to the mashed potatoes had butter or cream in it. This obviously did not hinder my or 43 other guests' experiences, but since I did ask to accommodate them much in advance, I did expect a little better than this. Obviously, Fogo de Chao is a Brazilian steakhouse, which is anti-vegan by its design, so I'm not even sure if this is a real shortcoming.   I would have my wedding at Fogo de Chao Las Vegas again in a heartbeat! Thanks again for an incredible wedding reception, Ricci!",

Our group of three started with a plateful of salad from the large salad bar and made our way back to the table. Once seated with our salads in front of us, we were quickly greeted by someone asking if this was our first time at the restaurant. Just having a large salad meant we would not have room for the bountiful skewers of meat waiting to be sliced and served to us.   We quickly put the salad plates to the side and concentrated on the meat. We flipped the card from red to green and like a \"Green light,\" servers with more meat than an army could eat were asking us for specific cuts and meat wellness. Superb! The filet was great and they even had bacon wrapped filet medallions if you wish 5/5. I tried about 7 types of meat and enjoyed the bacon wrapped succulent chicken breasts 5/5. When we thought there couldn't be anymore, we were told its all you can eat so keep the orders coming! When in ROME hahaha.  You wont have room for dessert but you will leave with an amazing meal with some of the best cuts of meat you have ever had! We did try a few of the fried bananas with condensed milk drizzled on top 5/5.   Enjoy and rest well when you pass into food coma at home :)",

I wish I had multiple stomachs to put all that good in. My favorite was the lamb chops and filet mignon. They were flavorful and melted in your mouth the minute it touched the tongue.

We came in for lunch (as it is way better priced and you basically get the same things as you would for dinner) and I ate so much I didn't even eat dinner that day.  The servers walk around with different meats and come to your table if the green coaster is up.  You can go to the salad bar and get accompaniments.  Since I had never been here before I loaded up on the salad bar but I definitely did not need to.  The meats were all flavored well and distinctive and did not need any of the garlic and peppers I picked up.  I liked the fact that you could request specific meat.  The house special, the lamb chops, and the lamb steak were highlights.  The bread they serve is great, as well as the plantains and polenta sticks.  I would definitely venture in here again for lunch when I don't feel like moving for the rest of the day",

This place has a beautiful ambiance and a nice salad bar but don't let the salad bar distract from the main event, the MEAT! So good every last bite of it! The meat is very salty but it's tastes delicious and I enjoyed every bite that I had. The staff was very friends and quick to serve. You have a card that when it's red means you don't want meat but when you flip it over to green the party starts and severs come from everywhere offering you different cuts!   The reason why I have 4 stars though is because one of the waiters came and offered our group shrimp which we happily accepted not knowing that the shrimp was an additional 21 dollar charge. Now what annoyed us is the fact that the waiter did not mention once it was going to cost more and when you are getting filet mignon left and right and ribs and chicken and every thing you can imagine part of the all you can eat you basically expect the shrimp to come with it. I'm not upset that they charge for seafood it's that they didn't mention it once. Other then that this place is delicious and I highly recommend coming here whether on a date or with a group of friends.",

    "text": "Recently the hubby and I had an invite to come and eat at Fogo de Chao. . .  @fogo is in my opinion, the Las Vegas Valleys best Brazilian Steak House. If you are looking for the Full Churrasco Experience, then this is the place to go. With an impressive Market Table & Feijoada <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBar.to&s=6ecde0275dbcf8ef5fd6d03aa977b1f3f8548ed4527020d6786017c5bd984cc7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bar.to</a> start, you gotta be careful not to fill up. In case you don't know, a Market Table & Feijoada Bar includes seasonal salads and soups, exotic vegetables, imported cheeses, smoked salmon, cured meats and more. . . We then moved on to the house special which was the Dry Aged Bone in T-Bone. It was beyond delicious, but a LARGE piece of meat. At a Churrasco restaurant, they have Gaucho chefs who grill each cut of meat over an 800 degree flame until it has reached the ideal temperature, taste and texture. About every kind of meat you can think of is available. The servers walk the floor with fresh cooked meats and look for patrons who have turned their table place cards green, identifying they want more meat. Then you can select from a seemingly non-stop menu of items such as Filete Mignon, Lamb Chops, Beef Ribs that LITERALLY (I know people say that, but for real!) melted in my mouth,bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filets, Shrimp and I could go on and on. . If you are looking for a good cut of meat and enjoy variations in your food, then Fogo is the place for you. Down to their drinks and deserts, I had no complaints. . . When it came to the service, it was impeccable! We were treated like family and wanted for nothing. Waited mere seconds for anything we needed and it seemed that our servers and the roaming Gauchos were multiplying, because there were so many that it seemed as if the entire staff was dedicated to us.",

My only complaint is, the meat servers didn't circle around as often as it had before.  Wish we got to try more varieties.  But overall, everything else is good.   Food is delicious as always!",

    "text": "I always know that the best way to bring a smile to my wife's face is to take her to a churrascaria. We were on our way to Texas de Brasil when I said, \"You know, Fogo is closer; why don't we try there?\" I'm glad I did.   Let's start with the service. Even though they were fairly busy, we never had to wait for a waiter to come by. The drinks refilled almost as if by magic, and everyone was friendly and nice, and happy to give suggestions as to what is their favorite part on the menu. The manager, Ricard, came by to introduce himself, and chatted for a while. We definitely felt like valued, important guests. It was like the experience you get when you're a regular at other places. So, I liked that.  Their salad bar is better, in my opinion, than that of TdB. More selections, and what was on it just tasted better. If my wife wouldn't have glared at me all night for blowing $50 on a salad bar and the fried bananas, I'd have just stuck with that, and been pretty happy.   The meats were all really good. (She seemed to love them, at least.) There's fewer meat selections than where we were heading, but the stuff was all cooked perfectly. I even enjoyed the leg of lamb, which is surprising, since I see lamb as a form of punishment. One of the servers told us of some off-menu items to try, and those were amazingly good.  Well worth the money.",

    "text": "The hubby and I had Thanksgiving dinner at Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas and it did not disappoint.  It was our very first visit here and it definitely won't be our last.  We had reservations since they tend to get very busy and were seated right away.  We've heard nothing but rave reviews about this restaurant so this time in town we just had to try it.  I suggested this place for the hubby since he is a total meat lover and even he was impressed (he's very hard to please when it comes to food).  After you sit down with your open salad bar selections they give you a round card that you place on your table.  Flip it to the red side and they won't bother you, flip it to the green side and they will stop by your table with all sorts of mouth watering grilled meats grilled right on some long metal rods.  When you're done flip it back to red, when you're ready for more flip it back to green.  The sauce they served to enjoy with their meats was really good, I think it was maybe olive oil based with cilantro, peppers, and chopped up garlic?  The meats were all tender and perfectly grilled, I am salivating just thinking about it.  I believe they had over 18 different meat varieties along with roasted turkey since it was Thanksgiving.  By the time we were done we were both ready to fall asleep right then and there on the table, but not before getting a chance to try their famous flan.  It was yummy and smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness...  Fogo do Chao is definitely a must try whether you are a vegetarian or a meat lover, everyone will be pleased.  I cannot possibly even think about visiting Las Vegas next time without stopping here for dinner.  Staff were all super attentive and quick, and the food/ambience was top notch.  Definitely the spot to have dinner at least once if you ever stop in sin city.",

Well when we asked for the check they had charged us for both kids and the surprise was never mentioned nor did it ever come!

Me and my pasta ways cleaned up on the pasta salad and green salad.   Fogo offered about a dozen meat choices sausage, lamb, beef and chicken. I would say that about 2-3 of them would be labeled as tasty. The rest of the meats lacked any seasoning or taste. It may be for those who want to add to salt and pepper, but I expected more flavor.   It was a great chance to experience Fogo de Chao but it didn't meet my overall expectations.

I made reservations and we came in as a large party. The staff was very accommodating and led us to a big table.  After some wine, everyone headed to the salad bar except me. I wanted to start with the meat!! Way to be unique right? So there I was by myself at this huge table eating an outrageous amount of meat. Unfortunately, I got sick of the meat fast. It was good and all but I think I just wasn't in the mood for that much meat. I flipped over my card and headed to the salad bar afterwards.  The salad bar was decent and had a good amount of food to choose from but similar to the meat, nothing really stood to me. I loaded my plate with a couple of items and headed back.   Dessert, on the other hand, was delicious and very nicely served in a fancy glass topped with a beautiful flower. Of course we stuck the flower in someone's ear and instagramed a photo.  Nice place overall, but I didn't feel as though it was anything extraordinary. It may have been my appetite that day so I have to give it a second try one of these days.  *** 3.5 stars rounded down this time for the lack of wow factor.",

The meats were delicious (I'm getting hungry just thinking back on on our visit), but I wasn't all that impressed with the salad bar. Though I haven't tried everything at the salad bars at Via Brasil or Texas de Brazil, they seem to have wider selections and I have found some dishes that I like; however, not too many at Fogo de Chao appealed to me. I'll still give them 5 stars for now, though, because I didn't try too many of them and the rest of the food was awesome. Also, it's not a huge deal as I don't go to churrascarias to eat salad.",

    "text": "As Best-man and host of my brothers Bachelor Party, this was a much needed treat for the whole group of county boys, and a much needed moment of R&R (rest and relaxation) for everyone. Since I made reservations, and we arrived on-time, check-in and being seated was seconds. Everything from the buffet selection, to the meats, to the mint jam was simply delectable and did much more than satisfied my brother and his friends. I ordered a glass of scotch (12yr Glen Levitt) to partner with the wide variety of strong and subtle flavors but paired extremely well with the lamb and mint jam combination. The highlight was definitely the desert. While checking-in I told the front hostesses that this was my brothers Bachelor Party and how I wasn't sure if Fogo did anything special for such occasions. They responded that they might be able to do something like a complimentary desert, but they would let my server and chef know. At the end of the meal they brought my brother his desert which was two full round servings of flan on a large plate with a raspberry reduction. Not only was the flan delicious, the perfect light and delicate balance of not too sweet or maple tasting, but the chef had arranged the flan to represent breasts, with blueberry nipples, and drew the female body with the drizzles of raspberry reduction. Most of my group expressed that eating at Fogo was the nicest restaurant that they have ever been not just because the food was delicious but because it was the best group experience we had together. Fogo De Chao, Las Vegas, was the epitome of service and ambiance which was the cherry, or blueberry, to top our memorable experience in Vegas celebrating my twin brothers last days as a Bachelor.",

The bar is elegant and have the best drinks there, even though I only drink beer, it's the best to have with the meats they serve. They have over 10 choices of meat. From filet mignon to lamb to rabbit and they are all cooked perfectly. Along with the selection of meats they have their buffet of sides, salads and desserts. The price is very inexpensive $35-50 for the quality of their food, so you will be completely satisfied with the whole meal and if you're in great company, it makes the whole experience that much better! Definitely a 5+ star recommendation!",

    "text": "I've never been to Brazil, but if this restaurant is any indication of what it's like, then I really need to go. First off, I really appreciate that it's not too far off the strip and parking isn't a problem. They have free valet service to make you feel important. Bonus!  Like any other Fogo, the ambience is dim, sexy and welcoming. The salad bar has an excellent choice of vegetables, condiments and one of my personal favorites - smoked salmon. When you come here you better be hungry! It was so delicious that I almost over gorged on the salad bar alone. I can't even say enough about the meats. I think the Picanha(top sirloin) is my favorite. Then the Fraldinha (bottom sirloin), and then the Linguica sausage.  They also serve chicken, pork and lamb options. The Gaucho chefs that prepare the food are actually trained in Brazil. They are also the ones who come out and present the meat to your table. We were talking to the restaurant manager, who by the way is a super-friendly guy that is very passionate about their food, and he mentioned that at this particular restaurant , there are only two chefs that are not Brazilian, but they were sent to Brazil to train.   When the Gaucho chefs come out and slice the meat off the skewer straight onto my plate, I get this primal feeling and my mouth salivates over the slight crisp of the outside meat from the flames and the aroma that come with it. I like to take a second to stare at the tender, succulent pink insides and watch the juices run when I slice into it. There's a hint of sea salt on the outside that add to the crisp flavor. It's so awesome.  If you have never been to a Fogo de Chao, the way the service works is this: The salad bar is of course like a buffet and it is probably the best salad bar I've ever been to. You go up, grab a plate and help yourself to as much as you want. After you sit back down, there are these coasters right next to your silverware that are red on one side and green on the other. When you flip it on the green side, it means \"bring some meat here\".  One by one the Gaucho chefs will come to your table with their particular cut of meat and slice off as much as you want. When you need to take a break just flip the coaster on its red side and they'll stop coming. You'll also have a regular waiter who tends to your drinks and brings you some side dishes like caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, polenta, bread, and whatever else you might need. They also have an extensive collection of wine that is prominently displayed behind a glass barrier.  The service here is flawless. You can tell the staff really takes pride in what they do. It is an amazing place for any occasion, and in Vegas it doesn't seem to matter if you're in a pair of shorts or in suit. Everyone is treated equally special.",

Start off with the salad bar, lots of things to choose from, all of which are tasty. Go light on the salad bar because the actual meal (meat and lots if it) is where it's at. As soon as you have finished your trip to the salad bar, flip your card over to the green side. The servers and different meats are abundant and they just keep coming until you flip the red side up to quench the onslaught. The meats are well seasoned and sooo good! The sides that come with the meal are garlic mashed potatoes, pretty good stuff, fried bananas, also quite tasty, and something else I can't remember...the real star was the meats obviously. The bread they served was kinda like a savory cream puff without filling and a herbed olive oil to put on it...super yummy. Not only was the food good but the service was excellent. Very friendly and helpful, they make you feel like they are happy you chose their restaurant. From beginning to end the whole experience was wonderful.",

They cook most of the meat medium-rare. Though on the shank they do have medium-well (sometimes). I just had to special order mine and I didn't really get the experience of them cutting it off the shank or anything.   Probably wouldn't go again for the reason stated above.

The price for lunch and dinner is slightly different, give or take a couple bucks.  Both places have exceptional customer service.  1 point for Fogo because they serve better tasting and cheesier cheese  bread.  1 point for Texas for their Lobster Bisque.  If I were to choose between the two, I guess I would say whoever thinks of offering free back rubs by beautiful brazilian woman first!  ...On second thought, we were offered free flan for dessert by our waiter..

I don't normally like lamb, but here it was quite tasty.  They had a good selection on wine.  It was our anniversary when we came here and I had put that note under the reservation online and when we ordered dessert they had written Happy Anniversary on the plate.

There were some side items on separate tables, beans (contained meat) and a wonderful tomato soup that was totally meat free. The quality is superb! All the waiter/waitresses were very knowledgable about what did and did not contain any meat which was very much appreciated. We were stuffed with the Market table, but we had the opportunity to try an entree and we chose the Sea Bass and Salmon alternatives (we don't eat red meat). The Salmon was perfect! the Sea Bass was excellent, although a little too sweet and the fried crust on the outer part of the fish was a little too thick and rich....Everything was top of the line, very nice! We were invited guests to this meal, otherwise we would never be able to afford such a meal. If you have the money to spend, I highly recommend it!",

We made 3 attempts to get our check. My boyfriend even went to find our server only to get the response \"where are you sitting\". We still didn't get the bill. Meanwhile all the tables around us were turned at least twice. When we finally got the bill no one would come by to pick it up so we could pay. We finally took our bill to the bar to find someone to help. Someone took our check and the manager came back with it.  I stated my disappointment and he listened which was good. To show my disappointment I signed the check in front of the manager with a big 0 for the tip. I understand busy on Valentines but that was ridiculous.",

Our server never cleared the dirty plates, they piled up at the end of the table. The server never came back to get us more drinks, only refilled water once over the 2 hour dinner. We went to the bar and got our own drinks.   At the end the manager was friendly and that's the reason for the 2 stars.",

    "text": "*military discount*  .  Went on Saturday 2-6-16 at about 6:45 PM. We waited in the bar and ordered a jack & coke and a regular coke for $16.49.  About 30 minutes later we were seated and we each chose the full churrascaria experience and a dessert and the total was a little over $114 after the discount.   .  Their salad bar has some unusual items on it like smoked salmon, hearts of palm, quinoa tabouleh, and kale salad and also some familiar items like caesar salad, sweet potato casserole complete with marshmallows on top, black beans, rice, soup, and a charcuterie board.   .  We sat down with salads and then it was like being hit by a meat tornado. We tried ribs, parmesean pork, bacon chicken, bacon beef, top sirloin, and garlic sirloin.  None of the meat was particularly tender.  My jaw was a little sore the rest of the night from all the chewing.  The side dishes were not very good.  The mashed potatoes tasted instant and were covered in ginormous cracked peppercorns which made them hard to eat.  The polenta was room temperature and bland, but the bananas were quite tasty. That cheesy bread is something magical and with a little bit of butter it is divine.   Their chimichurri is also delicious and it reminds me of a very herbal italian dressing.   .  Service was indifferent except for the rodizio guys who were more friendly than our server but less courteous than they could be.  The best part of the meal was the dessert which was called \"strawberry cream\" and topped with a beautiful orchid.  It was a glorified milkshake but delicious and I loved every bite.  .  I've been to TDB 3 or 4 times and we decided to try this place out for shiggles. Fogo de Chao is not for me.  Sorry I cheated on you, TDB!!! TAKE ME BACK!",

Really over indulged but, as with any \"buffet\" style dining, this was expected.  Manager Mr. Pinto, was super gracious to us and told us to look him up the next time we are in town.

    "text": "The restaurant is located in a parking lot with ample parking. There is complimentary valet service at the front of the restaurant (don't forget tip).   The people working at valet greeted us and were welcoming. As my girlfriend and I made our way inside, we met the hostess who did not seem too thrilled to see us. She did not smile or say anything until I initiated the conversation by stating that we had a 7pm reservation. The hostess seemed to have trouble locating my reservation even though I made it through their website. We were seated coldly and were told that our waitress would be with us shortly. My girlfriend and I chatted for 10 to 15 minutes but noticed that no one came by to help us. There were several large parties around us and it seemed like we were forgotten. I had to flag a staff member down to mention that no one had helped us yet. She was extremely apologetic and she took care of our drinks. After we got our first plate from the market table, our waitress showed up but at that point there was not much that was needed.   I was very excited to try the various cuts of meat, but I only liked a few. Garlic sirloin was flavorful, but very fatty. The leg of lamb and bacon wrapped beef were delicious. The remaining cuts of meat were extremely dry and tough (Pork sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, house special top sirloin, chicken drums, and flank steak). Ultimately, I was let down by the quality of meat. In addition, some of the cuts were overly seasoned. I sampled each cut several times to get a better base line and noticed that there was a lack of consistency. One time a cut might be more tender/flavorful and other times it was extremely dry/bland. In addition, I noticed that I was offered flank steak and top sirloin at least 8 to 10 times, but other cuts only a few times. The salad bar was pretty good. The quinoa tabouleh and mozzarella caprese salad had a lot of flavor. Smoked salmon was pretty good.  Potato salad and chicken salad was bland and forgettable. Per my girlfriend, the bread rolls were the best thing they offered.   There was one gentleman clearing up our table at the end that was awesome. He seemed genuinely excited to help us and even helped us get our check. I wish I had gotten his name so I could give him more credit. Our waitress was once again MIA when we needed her.    I was expecting a nice dinner with my girlfriend and we had dressed up a bit, but it seemed like it was not necessary. I saw plenty of people walking around in baggy t-shirts, basketball shorts, booty shorts, snap backs, bandanas, etc. Not attire I would associate with an upscale restaurant. Honestly, you could probably come here in workout attire and still fit right in. There were several groups that were overly drunk/yelling over each other.  At the end of the day our bill came out $106.xx - $50 (summer special through facebook) + tip = $80 for 2 people. For $80 dollars, it was meh.... would I spend $110 + tip here, hell no. The meat quality does not match the price point and the ambiance is far from classy. I would much rather pay half that at a casual dinner spot for similar quality. If you want to try good Churrascaria, hit up Agora in Irvine CA, Pampas in Palo Alto CA, or Espetus in San Mateo CA.",

I was disappointed in the service,  as I was with a group of Chinese and there were some language barriers.  Most restaurants in Las Vegas seem to be able to handle this type of issue without any service problems,  but here the employees were noticeably impatient. In one instance, when asked about one of the menu items (the chicken) the word \"chicken\" was very clear when the question was asked. The waiter repeated it about 5 times to \"confirm\", but it just came off as petty and intolerant.  Considering the $600 check, I thought that was a bit unfortunate.",

The salad bar at Fogo to choa was great, the food is fresh, the steak is juicy and wonderful, and the service is amazing, however it still isn't Texas de Brazil. Texas de Brazil Has way better cheese bread,and the steak is more salty and juicy. The salad bar at Fogo to choa again is fresh and has lots of options, however doesn't have the flavor of Texas De brazil, it is missing the grape salad  and other cold salads, the dressings aren't as good either. All this being said this Resteraunt is still amazing and I would still go again. I enjoyed the ambiance and since I went for Mother's Day the management gave a gift to all mothers of three free meals (dinner or lunch )! Very nice touch. This Resteraunt is definitely worth trying.

There are a lot of meats, cheeses, and salads to choose from but if you're coming to Fogo, you're not coming for the salad bar.  The meats were cooked to perfection and with AYCE, I was stuffed.  There are too many meats to list, and honestly I wasn't sure what cuts I was eating at times.  I preferred the steak selections, but you just know what looks good when you see it.  The food couldn't be beat, but I wouldn't recommend Fogo for large groups/business meetings.  It got pretty loud while the servers were working their way through the room, and at times the speaker had to stop and let people get their meat fix.  Overall, this is a great experience with great eats!",

Salad bar is great with all the salad you could want plus fine cheeses, cured meats, etc.  The main course meats are the best I've ever had.  The sides are great.  Service is great.  Price is completely reasonable.  With wine, bill was $164 for some incredible food for 2 people.",

He liked the filet here but the lamb chops and leg of lamb are 5 stars at TDB.   All around I prefer TDB for the salad bar, rice/beans, sauteed mushrooms and the heavenly lobster bisque and the larger variety of meats. The meats offered at FDC were a good variety but noticed they had 3 different top sirloin selections. The black beans at FDC were mealy and needed to be cooked longer. The side dishes of mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, bananas were good. Our guest really enjoyed the cheese rolls. The service was attentive. They seated our 5 top in a dining area mostly occupied by large parties of 6-12 people. It got so noisy we couldn't have a conversation across the table. My tip if you are a party of 4 or less request the main dining room near the salad bar.",

The baby lamb chops. Oh my god. I don't even remember the name of every cut of beef I've had there, but 90% of them were out of this world delicious. They even have some special cuts that they don't serve to everyone but you can get on special request. I've been lucky enough to come here with someone in the know and have gotten to try the special reserved cuts which were amazing! They also have a pretty extensive salad bar, but I try not to fill up on silly things like salad and vegetables when I come here. But one of the people in my group was a vegetarian, and he seemed completely satisfied with the meal he received from the salad bar. I felt a little bad I dragging a vegetarian to an all-you-can-eat meat place, but not really because its too good to pass up just cause you are being forced to dine with crazy non-meat eating people. And as long as you keep your card on the green the food keeps on coming. Now that's my kind of place!",

    "text": "Yum! As a Texas de Brazil favorite, I was nervous about coming here, but I wasn't disappointed!  We came here with my husband's family to celebrate a late Christmas.  We are all huge meat lovers, so this is right up our alley.    The concept is simple.  You get a card that is red on one side and green on the other.  The waitstaff walks around with different cuts of meat.  They have sausage, chicken, lamb, flank steak, filet, ribs, pork, and more!  When your card is green, they will offer it to you.  Red means they won't come to you.  In my case, red and green both screamed, \"Stay away!\"  We actually had to request meats from our server, as it felt as if our table was being avoided at some point.  Once that was taken care of, everything else was great.  They even offered to make the meat well done for my husband's grandma.  They serve this cheese puff pastry thing as an appetizer.  Omg.  As a bread and cheese lover, all I can say is yuuuum!! But that's how they get you filled up. So be careful - they're addicting!!  The server will also bring mashed potatoes and fried bananas and plantains.  So yummy!  Then there is a self-service area where you can get an assortment of sides from: soups, salads, cheese, salami, rice (way too salty), green beans, fruit, etc.    We had the chocolate molten lava cake for dessert, which was also yummy!  Although dinner is pricey, it's all around a great treat.  We will be back!",

My favorite meat was probably the garlic steak it was super juicy and had a decent amount of fat on each piece. I also really liked their heart shaped meat I think it was the top sirloin (?). Their lamb was also good and not super over powering. The rack of lamb was also pretty good, but I'm not a lamb person. I forgot the cut of meat it was but one was on the rare side which was really delicious! The meat is really salty because later on that night I couldn't stop drinking water, but needless to say it was a really great meal!   I paired the meat with a nice merlot. They didn't have the one I wanted but they brought out a different one similar to it.   I liked the ambiance of this place. It's dim and very intimate. One of my friends picked up the check, but I'm guessing it was around 50+ a person.",

What's not to love about that?  The meat quality was good overall and there was plenty of it.  I loved how they brought us plates of pao de queijo, mandioca (fried yucca root), and fried plantain.  The fact that they served Antarctica guarana was another plus.  However, negative points for not having two of my favorites at a churrascaria, the grilled pineapple and chicken hearts.

He saw I was against the wall and not in a good spot so he was there to make sure I got everything I wanted all night.  I asked for Lamb and got both chops and loin as well as anything else I requested.  As usual, the food was excellent.  The many cuts of meat were all perfectly prepared as to temperature and seasoning.  This was made even better with this Fogo's Chimichurri.  That is a difference I have noticed among them and the Vegas location Chimi was excellent.  The pork ribs were moist and tender as were the beef choices but the Filet Mignon was exceptional.

As far as buffets go, there are bigger selections on the strip.  But this is not crowded, not huge and priced reasonably-for a buffet.  I will be back here when I return.

I can cook most any meat they bring and usually do, except one. Lamb! I love lamb, but that tend to cost more than I like so I don't cook it at home. Fogo however, will bring me lamb chops until I explode. Thin mint anyone? I asked one of they waiter to send my the lamb and only the lamb. They must not get many requests for lamb chops because they had to cook some. After a short wait they had a skewer ready to go. And then another skewer and another. I was in lamb chop heaven. I think I ate a whole lamb. Sorry Shari Lewis. Oh and they brought out mint jelly.   Lamb Chops, that's why I love Fogo!",

First off, as a person who does not eat red meat- you will not be left hungry after your visit. I really liked that the market bar had exotic selections and plentiful veggies. I only wish there were more salad options. I absolutely LOVED their cheese bread, pao de queijo, and could not stop myself from filling up on them. Other sides were brought to our table, such as fried polenta and plantains.   Now for the meats: Compliments: -Meat was always sliced hot and well-cooked  -Servers with sticks of meat were constantly making their rounds  -Easy to request what you wanted  Criticisms:  -Quality was alright. Good for trying lots of different meats, but if you want a quality piece, would go somewhere that offers an entree of that specific cut.",

The feeling is a loud hurry up to get you out and the servers reflected this attitude.  I had to assume that there was no managment in the building and if there was they couldn't care less about a table of 9. I have had much better service at McDonalds for 1/100th of the price. Not only would I not recommend this resturant, but I will make it a goal to inform as many of my friends, via the internet, to avoid this place and to tell their friends.  Bottom line is over-priced for service and quality of food.",

When you're in Las Vegas with a large group this would be perfect, they have a high end atmosphere with large tables for groups of friends and family. They are a high-end Brazilian steak house,  that serves all you can eat, delivered to your table by simply turning over a red or green card to indicate to the watchful eye of the servers, that you want more meat delivered! They will come running! I've been to the Houston Texas location also,  and they're consistently awesome time and time again. They offer the largest selection of steaks such as brisket, top sirloin, tenderloin and filet mignon all included along with lamb, chicken and pork. All the meats are slow cooked and smoked Brazilian style. So for a night out for 56 bucks a person for all you can handle steaks in Vegas in a vibrant atmosphere, located right off the strip on Flamingo, its worth the value.",

    "text": "If you have never been to a Brazilian BBQ place you will probably love Fogo. For the purpose of this review I am comparing the Las Vegas Fogo to other Brazilian BBQ places and in that regard it falls a little short. I have been to Fogo in Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles as well as several other similar restaurants (Chima, Via Brazil, Texas de Brazil etc).   I will say this- I have been about four times and it is definitely improving- the worst visit was my first. During that visit service was very bad (compared to other Fogos) , there was an odd smell in the entire restaurant, and the sides all arrived cold each time. The meat service was sporadic both in terms of availability and quality.  When I go to Fogo here is what I want- I want nothing but outside pieces with a nice crust, I want the meat to be sliced nice and thin and I don't want to get 10 meats all at once and then nothing for a 15 minute stretch. At this Fogo there were big gaps between the meats, the slicing was done rather clumsily, and some of the meat hadn't been cooked properly so there was no crust. Some of the Gauchos also would keep circulating the meats after the outside pieces had all been cut off which is a big no no in my book.   The times I have been back since then the quality has definitely improved. If you cut out that first visit my rating would be 4 stars instead of 3. I have been for lunch and dinner and I think the dinner service is better- they seem to have more people working and the meat is generally better prepared.",

This restaurant was right next to McCormick and Schmick Steakhouse but compared to that restaurant, it was packed. I went there lunch time. The food was exquisite. The meats, as always, were cooked to perfection. The salad bar has many tempting items but don't fill up on those because BBQ is the main attraction of this place. As long as you show your \"green\" card on your table the waiters will keep bringing you BBQ meats at your table. My favourites include Lamb Chops, Fillet Minion, and Rib Eye. Lunch buffet is roughly $35/person. Deserts are extra.",

It seems funny doting over the salad bar at carnivore's paradise, but it is one of my favorites anywhere. Prosciutto, cheeses, grilled zucchini, artichoke hearts... You can get super creative and find yourself enjoying a well balanced meal. Or, you can gorge yourself on the cheesy bread, steak and fried bananas. However you do it, you'll leave satisfied.",

    "text": "My husband and I love Fogo de Chao. When we lived in Houston several years ago we used to go quite often. I believe that is the first location in the US, so we are like pioneers. Then, just a year or so after we moved to Phoenix, they opened one in Scottsdale. And now there is one in our home-away-from-home city, Las Vegas. Hooray!  This location is much like the others though the decor was a little nicer, I think.  Food was excellent as always.  There is such a variety of meat, I think anyone could find a cut to their liking.  And as for the red and green sauces, they make it that much better! And don't  forget about the salad bar. So much good stuff. I love the marinated veggies like hearts of palm, artichokes, and mushrooms.  Oh, and those little round red sweet peppers.  Have one of those with some fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomato. Yummy!  The service here was phenomenal.  We had a pleasant time with the bartender while waiting for my sister and her husband to arrive. She was nice enough to get us some of that amazing cheesy bread to munch on while we waited. I forgot her name but she is from Omaha and makes one awesome Caipirinha!  Once they arrived and we were all seated, my sister discovered she was missing one of her diamond earrings.  Practically the whole staff stopped what they were doing to help look for it.  The manager (I think) even came by and expressed genuine concern. Long story short it turned out to be at the babysitters house, must have fallen off while she was bringing the baby inside.  It was just nice to see a place where the staff is so friendly and really cares about their customers.",

The meats are cooled deliciously, but if I'm paying the price for dinner, I could pass on some of the cheaper meats. When the waiters are coming around with the sausage and chicken pieces, I say no but get a plate full anyways. And when I'm looking for the filet and better cuts, there is no one to be found. So the idea of getting full on the cheaper stuff and only give so little pricier cuts is a great business plan for the restaurant but not for me.",

The service wasn't that great at Fogo. When I asked someone passing by if I could get some salt, he visibly looked pissed off. Also, they were really pressuring us to leave because they were closing down after lunch. They didn't do this at Texas de Brazil, and I was never treated rudely by anyone there. Also,Texas de Brazil is bigger and more beautiful with a better atmosphere. Importantly, Texas de Brazil's bathroom didn't stink like sewage. I don't get why restaurants don't fix that. Gross!!!",

I had the opportunity to be one of the firsts guests at the place for the night on a weekend and it was nice to see how the tables and food was set up so nicely. They have private rooms that looked great for a rehearsal dinner or large group. Intimate areas. The place settings and decorations on point.   The salad bar was very fresh and delicious. Fresh cheese, salads, fruits, rice, beans, bread, veggies. It would have been nice to see some soups but didn't see any.   The meats were on point and pretty juicy. We flipped our go card from red to green and had meat out to us within a couple seconds. When that card is green, it is green. I had to remember to turn the card to red cause they kept bring so much meat. I hear about steakhouses being too salty and I almost felt the meat needed some more salt. Some of the meat was bland. It was still good but needed something. When you got the meat they also serve bread, mashed potatoes, sweet banana and some other item. The bread and mash was delicious.   I was somewhat annoyed on how good the service was. It was like every 5 seconds someone was asking me if I was done with the mash or done with the bananas or done with my drink. Yeah I would like to take that last drink or eat that last bite of potatoes. Nope, they would just clear away. They will gladly bring you a whole new dish of mashed potatoes but really I just wanted to finish the last bite. Really this was the only reason I gave 4 stars. OO. and its pretty pricey. At least for me. I really don't eat that much and we were only there for about 20 minutes before being completely stuffed. So was it really worth $150 bucks. Maybe, maybe not.",

So I couldn't wait to share the experience with my 2 friends while we were in Vegas. Very disappointing in comparison. We were seated 30 min. After our reservation time. The person that came to our table spoke so quickly we couldn't understand what she said. A waiter came by with shrimp cocktail to offer, we accepted not realizing we just rang up another 27.00 to our tab. The meat that was served was salty and undesirable to say the least. The salad bar was the best thing this place had to offer. For $314.00 a salad bar is hardly worth it.",

My husband didn't think it would be an issue since we also paid for our Vegas wedding with the same card with no problems.  From the sounds of it, it happens often so if you plan on paying for a large party and you're from out of town it would be best to contact your bank prior.  We were there for what felt like forever and the staff was so kind and understanding to the situation, there was a gentleman that stood out the most, he checked on us frequently and offered drinks and coffee as we waited. He was even so kind to bring us fireball shots. His customer service was amazing! I wish I remembered his name...he was so empathetic and so kind. Though we wasted so much time there waiting for our bank and family to come to our rescue he made the experience great! Thank you so much!",

The excuse for not having soups is that that's how original Fogo restaurant was, which I think is a BS excuse. If you are serving salads, meats, sides and dessert; then soups should be served to cater to varying customer needs.   We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was very delicious and refreshing. The meats were tasty, particular the leg of lamb. The sides and the bread with chimichurri sauce were very delicious.   Overall, its a very good location in terms of food and service. They need to add more items to the salad bar and they have a potential to be better than Texas de Brazil.",

We had reservations at 7.  We didn't get to eat until after 8. The bride even asked when we could start eating. And when we finally got the meat served to us, everything was medium to well done. Everyone at my end of the table asked for medium rare, which we had to pass on a lot because it was too cooked. The salad bar was nice. We only had four sides: cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta fries. For the price that was paid, I would have expected better meat.",

Because of the location, I imagine it was a large group in town for a conference, but they took up the whole space and it had to be near 100 people. It wasn't an issue, except that we were starting our meal around the same time as that large group so the line for the salad bar wrapped around a full 1.25 times. :) **  I would have stayed in my seat and just drank/ate the little fluffy-bread-yummy-like-crack balls but I didn't know when the line would get better and I was hungry.   We tried many different meats and the meat servers (?) are very diligent when it comes to paying attention to the red/green that says that you're open to more meat or not. (This is probably one of my favorite sentences I've ever written on Yelp, btw.)  It was an excellent experience and very much unlike the Brazilian steakhouse experience in the movie Bridesmaids, in every way possible. The sweet bananas they give you - KILL ME, THEY'RE DELICIOUS.  **Fogo management, if you're listening, maybe warn people that a large party will be there at the same time, if someone is making a reservation? I'd believe that there is no way around the long line, but it's just nice to know ahead of time, IMO. (Preparing for a pre-dinner cocktail  or something...)",

My wife said that the restroom room was not clean and the ambience was average. We did not order any drink and I ended paying $200 for three including $23 in tips so the price is expensive and in my opinion is not good value, I could have better experience for $66/person. Parking is ok and they offer valet if you are looking for one. Location is near the strip.",

Fugo de Chao is no exception.  We ate here with a large party (over 20).  The servers were great and did not skip a beat.  Parking is kind of scarce because most of the parking lot is set aside for valet but they do offer complimentary valet.   The restaurant is very big and they easily accommodated our large party.   Now the food.  The meat was great.  I tried most of the steaks, sirloin, ribeye, etc.  The only one I didn't really like was the garlic sirloin; it was kind of rubbery but the good thing about a Brazilian steakhouse is they keep bringing you different kinds of meats (all you can eat).  So if there is a meat you don't like, they will bring you other ones you can choose in short order.  The sausage was great also, wish they had more of a selection of sausages though. I didn't try the chicken or lamb.  Great food and experience.",

    "text": "I literally cannot say enough positive about this place.  While looking for a place to take our clients when they visit us from all over the world, we went to both Texas de Brasil (Town Square) and Fogo de Chao.   The food is actually pretty close. But the service was NO COMPETITION at all.  At TdB we received what I'd call above average service and so about a week later we visited FdC. The service was IMPECCABLE - even for a first time guest and a party of two. They went out of their way to anticipate EVERYTHING we would need.  Since that first visit over two years ago - we've visited with family, had date nights, taken multiple parties of 10-20 people and even had a few groups of 50+ here. They have ALWAYS exceeded our expectations.  This is quite clearly the BEST SERVICE of any restaurant in Las Vegas (which is saying a LOT considering the competition here) and one of the TOP SERVICE restaurants of any restaurant I've been in worldwide.   The service really is THAT GOOD!  The management team is ALWAYS on the floor making sure the dining experience flows for everyone - whether they are slow (just after opening for the evening) or packed out (usually from 7pm onward until closing.  LOCALS - go early! 6pm is usually when their best servers come onto shift and the convention crowd doesn't usually pick up until closer to 7. So you have the best service and also avoid the longer lines that sometimes happen a little later.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG with this restaurant, whether date night or a huge party. They have a delicious Sea Bass if a couple of your guests don't eat like a starved carnivore and also my Vegan clients always rave about the Market Table (Buffet and Salad Service).  There is almost NOTHING within reason that they won't do to meet every need. So go there with all confidence. In 2 years I've probably spent close to $80-100k in this restaurant and I have NEVER regretted a visit. EVER!",

I am a pescatarian (hate saying that, i sound like a brat!) so while I do not indulge in the meat selection, I know my man friend is more than delighted about the selection and service. They walk around with plates of meat and you have a little card that you can say \"yes\" or \"no,\" so when you have enough meat on your plate you can just sit back and enjoy your selection.   Now for me, I got my fill at the \"salad\" bar. I use quotation marks because it is definitely not your typical salad bar. I was pleasantly pleased with smoked salmon, pasta salads, cheeses, delicious salad blends, soup, and many many vegetables. Additionally, when you do choose to get all of the meats, the salad bar is included as well.   It was his birthday, so they brought out a very delicious \"happy birthday\" caramel cheesecake. They also dedicated a couple of dollars off our bill! Overall, a really nice dining experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to dish out a couple of bucks for some delicious food.",

I received my check only to see a $3.95 charge for 5 glasses. I was never told that refills are extra; highly disrespectful and unappreciated. Very hesitant about coming again based off of somethings so simple that is basic communication to the customer. Very disappointing to say the least.",

    "text": "Well, I have to call it like I see it and it was not all that great like everyone says. Our hostess wasn't very cheerful, it seemed like she is working several jobs and is tired. When she asked if we knew the dining procedures and we said we did, it seemed like she was relieved that she didn't have to explain the concept. The night we dined it seemed like we didn't have an actual waiter but someone that was attending to our table and taking away finished plates. The meal starts off with the salad bar and the first thing you experience is the dishes are hot from the dishwashing machine. Presentation at the salad bar was lacking compared to the \"other\" Brazilian place further south of the Las Vegas strip. The soup of the day was asparagus, but is there a sign for it? no, but there are 2 raw asparagus spears laying next to the soup container to give you a hint. The soup tasted funny, like it was pea soup instead. Funny taste, not too much fun involved though. Salad bar was messy and they need someone to keep it maintained, people drop things and no one is around to keep it looking nice.  The flavors was not all that good either, the cheese was either hard or mushy depending on what you picked. The specialty cheese had no flavor and the swiss cheese was just hard as a rock. I think it was mozzarella cheese, but it was like a wet marshmellow and gooey. Platters of salad items laying on hard ice and no real presentation at all. A pair of salad tongs laying inside the lettuce after someone had used it. Blah! There was a pan of bacon that was really tasty, but it seemed more of a breakfast item, but it was there and it was good. The guachos with the meats were kind of aggressive here like they are on commission to get rid of the meat, often my red/green card was flipped to red (no meat please) and they would still ask if you wanted what they had to offer. I was like what good is the card if the server isn't paying attention to it? Chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't good, the chicken was dry and over cooked, the other various meats were either bland or extremely salty.  We struggled through what they brought us and ate what we could. I saw sausages go by a few times, but it never arrived at our table and someone in our party actually had to ask for some to be brought over. As our dinner was coming to an end a gaucho brought over some rib eye steak that I thought was good, but where was it when we first started to eat? Overall for the same price the other place further south is much better.",

As we arrived on the restaurant, we saw that the parking lot was fairly packed, but that was all resolved by complimentary valet, there was no wait and the valet guy greeted us nicely and promptly took our car. As we walked in we mentioned that we have made a reservation and I was expecting to wait a little, as it was a busy night, but the host took us in and seated us right away. The place was fairly packed about 90% of the seats were occupied with multiple BBQ guys walking fast paced. I was expecting that the meat would come at a fast paced too and make us feel a bit rushed, but that wasn't the case, they were very professional. We enjoyed our meal at a pace we pleased and didn't feel any rushed. The whole experience of dining here was seamlessly effortless and felt that the workers were all very professional. Thanks for such a good service!  -Complimentary valet. -Waiter had great customer service. -BBQ guys are well paced. -Quality meat, loved their house special top sirloin.",

I felt that the meat selections were tastier here than at Texas de Brazil (I have been there 3 times). It seems that other reviewers compared them often. Yes, Texas de Brazil has quite the salad bar, but if you want to go to a Brazilian steakhouse for the meats...then come here. All the sides were great, especially the Po De Queijo (warm cheese bread)...we had several helpings. They have more than just the basics at the Market Bar and the flavor of everything was quite awesome! We enjoyed wine, beer, and cocktails. For dessert, we had a wonderful molten chocolate cake and a smooth, velvety flan.  We all raved about the food, but even more impressive was the service. They were all so very helpful and attentive. If we wanted anything (for example, rib eye steak, rare), someone was always available for us to ask and they would send someone over right away. Each one of us had to turn our \"circle\" to red a few times...meat offerings were coming over all the time and we couldn't keep up. They were very busy, but that didn't affect our service in anyway. Needless to say, we left feeling very full.",

Fogo has an amazing salad-appetizer bar with many types of salads, cured sausage, a variety of cheeses,  fruit, and typical Brazilian fare.  Take it easy on the Caipirinhas, I mean the salad bar, because next comes the Brazilian Pan de Queso...yummy cheese bread, and the sweet plantains, so nice.  One more Caipirinha and turn over the round disk to green. Green is for go... Red is stop...  Geeen: Here comes the Gauchos with churassco grilled skewers of meats, chicken and seafood. They grill a variety of meats, lamb is my favorite, with a little seasoning, rock salt and slice it thin hot on your plate. Amazing variety.   Did I mention the Caipirinha? Cachaca is Brazilian alcohol fermented from fresh sugar chain. The cachaca is mixed with sugar and lime over ice to make a heavenly Caipirinha. You can't drink just one...  This is a busy place, but take your time and enjoy the experience. It's fun.",

At first I felt pressured to buy appetizers, cocktails, and upgrade to the good aged meat but I respectfully declined. It is already pricey so I don't think they should upsell anything.  If people want to let them order no pressure but I get it, it is a business.  During service, the manager was overlooking everything and made sure we were alright.  The quality of meats were great.  When we asked for well done we got medium rare, and vice versa.  So I think they could work on getting their cook on the meat a little more accurate.  The BEST thing i loved about the food was those cheese bread apetizers.  It comes with the meal but we kept munching on those and the manager ordered more for us to take home.    The salad bar was good.  I was really there for the meats and since there is only one more competitor I feel like they are kinda alike.  I don't have a preference other than the cheese bread and service is better than Texas.",

Not too crowded around 5pm so it was prefect timing... the staff was amazing! Our waiter, Tony N, was extremely helpful pointing out new items that were added to the menu.  Being attentive (asking if we needed any specific meats, anything more to drink, etc) and super friendly! We found out that he just moved to Vegas from the same area I was from. We chatted up a great conversation through out our entire meal. He made us feel like we were family there celebrating a special birthday.  It was really nice to visit a place that has a majority of tourist dining and the staff making us locals feel welcomed. We have some family coming into town next week and will be dining there again!!",

Pass on the side dishes of plantains, mashes pots and cheese bread... also the bacon wrapped chicken. You, sir, are here for the beef. Once your carnivorous desires are satisfied from the waves of meat, you may then proceed to the self serve bar for fruit and or request the dessert menu.

Our hostess told us we would get complimentary desserts for our birthdays.    The salad bar had a nice variety; my favorite was the papaya.  Sides dishes they brought us included plantains, mashed potatoes, cheese bread, and some kind of fried bread which looked more like fat steak fries.  We had 3 orders of the plantains because they were so yummy.    Tbh, I felt the meats were lacking in variety.  Sirloin seemed to be the main option.  We definitely had plenty to eat so no complaints there.  Service was attentive.  We had a different server towards the end and he seemed a bit put off when we told him about our free dessert offer.    Overall it was a good experience but I'm on the fence on whether I would come back over the other 2 Brazilian steakhouses I've tried.  If you sign up to get emails on their website, you might receive coupons.  I got a $25 off one for my birthday.",

All marinated well!   Customer service- OMG! What service! Everyone was amazingly nice, helpful, and patient while we decided to take the meat or pass. They were even helpful to my little boy who wanted to try taking the meat from the servers using his tongs. And if you want well done, they'll be sure to come back with the meat! This was all on Christmas Day too. They truly made our holiday a happy experience. We'll be back!  For families with kids: Kids 6 and under eat free, which is a HUGE plus for families since there's really nothing to eat for kids. Our young ones ate mostly the cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fruit, and plantains. At least one of our kids ate some meat.",

    "text": "Last time we were here was a year ago. Although everything went well during our visit, we just preferred the salads and way the meats were seasoned and cooked at TdB.  Yesterday, we decided to stop by before going to a show at the HardRock. Glad we did! Their lamb chops and leg of lamb were phenomenal. Just about every red meat we tried were good except for the top sirloin which had too much gristle. The kale salad was delicious, the sweet pea soup wasn't my favorite but the meats more than made up for it. The gauchos were super nice and accommodating. Service was exceptional especially from our server, Jose. We're shifting our loyalties back to Fogo!",

    "text": "Fogo De Chao is a non stop throw down of meat after meat after meat after meat after meat after meat after meat....after meat after meat.  The system at Fogo is simple. They give you a two sided coaster type of thing with two sides, Red and green. Red means stop bringing food to me, Green means BRING IT ON!  Bring it on they did... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBring.It&s=31abc263017c6357c8b223d988ebf95c9045b9b3ee8b171c6bd95e833247830b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bring.It</a>.On.They.Did.  I look left, here comes some top sirloin. I check my right flank, boom Prime Rib. It was then that the wait staff had me surrounded. They began offering lamb chops, bacon wrapped chicken breast, pork spare ribs, and brisket.  I was getting dizzy, so much protein. My plate looked like a war zone with attacks (bites) hitting all over the place.   Each piece of meat was somehow better than the last. At one point I thought I needed some time to myself and my plate so i flipped the switch to red. I never actually saw any of the people with me in my party shake their heads, but I felt their disappointment.  It was at this point that I knew what I had to do. Go all in and just keep saying yes to more food, and shoveling admittedly delicious food in my mouth.  I was luckily walking into Fogo while i was Hungry Like the Wolf, shout out Duran Duran. If you do not bring an appetite to Fogo, you will be overwhelmed. If you bring a normal appetite to Fogo, you will be overwhelmed. but if you are willing to gain a slick 6 pounds via protein alone (True story, I am still frightened about what I did) you may just get....overwhelmed. Fogo is the last of the undefeated restaurants. Forever respect to you Fogo de Chao.  My wife said the mashed potatoes are amaze",

Afterwards they come around serving different meats (ribs, chicken, sausage, steak, etc...) it's seasoned good probably a little too salty for my taste. They also offer bread for the table and plantains and fried polenta which was a nice touch.  Definitely bring an appetite when you come here. It's worth the experience!",

They also have a salad bar but I recommend saving room for all the delicious meats they have. It's about $70 a person but they will offer additional items like wine and shrimp cocktails that are not included in the \"all you can eat.\" However, Thare delicious and worth trying out.

We came for T-Giving with a party of 8 plus a toddler and the experience was very worthwhile.  The service was attentive and the meat dealers appeared very often.  The filet was outstanding, and the only issue I had was that the chicken breast was very dry.  Bring your wallet, it is pricey and they really gouge you for beverages. Sorry about the quality of the pics, I was too busy scarfing down endless animal protein. I highly recommend this place for special occasions.",

The restaurant had very few guests and there was plenty of free tables , so I'm not sure why they smooshed 8 of us on one small circular table. A slightly larger table could have been accommodated but the request was denied.        I think because everything was paid in advance, the service lacked some. The party arrived at 1:40pm and we were told the buffet area closed at 2:00pm. ( we did have reservations, they knew we were coming). We had to rush to get our food and we ended up with slim pickings.   Most of the items on the salad/ buffet bar were very  picked through or all out. They were not refilled or replaced. This was very disappointing. I feel bad for the bride and groom because they pad a lot of money for this buffet and the items were no longer fresh or replaced.   I did like the the meats. The meat is brought to you at your table and is very fresh and flavorful. The deserts were also very fresh and good.  I don't think I'd come back here. Someone's wedding reception should be treated better especially since they are paying top dollar per head.",

    "text": "When it comes to Brazil, plenty of things come to mind -- the beaches, reverse drains, bikinis, and obnoxious Pitbull songs. Brazilian churrascaria cuisine should be among those, however, especially if you're a carnivore like I am! Fogo de Chao is YET ANOTHER of my favorite restaurants in town, showcasing the meaty churrasco cuisine in True over-the-top Vegas style -- in fact, I brought my father here yesterday to treat him and my mother to dinner in lieu of the typical celebrations you'd associate with this time of the year!  And oh, my goodness. Was it a great choice. Wear loose pants and come in hungry, you'll need it. Fogo has both a salad bar and their churrasco experience, where they bring out numerous cuts of meat for your consumption -- you can really get your Medieval meat fantasies on here! The salad bar has plenty of offerings, a sampling of which I have in the pictures below. You also get pao de queijo, Brazilian cheese bread, and sides like garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and crisp polenta that all are good.  The stars of the show, here, are the meats -- chicken, beef, lamb and pork are all on offer in various preparations and levels of doneness, and no matter what you pick it's all VERY good! Make sure to pace yourself so you can get a little bit of everything! Both my parents loved what they had, some of which are among the pictures I took below.  Of course, I HAD to save room for dessert -- Fogo has plenty of desserts for all kinds of sweet teeth, but we got the molten chocolate cake since it came with ice cream. Rich, indulgent, and light thanks to the ice cream and whipped cream, it was a perfect ending to our meal. Needless to say, my parents were both satisfied with their meal, as was I!  Fogo really sets the bar high for churrasco -- and while it can be pricey if you come in for dinner, it's well worth the cost. And if you're feeling the weekend, you can come in to try their weekend brunch -- something to look forward to! With food and service like this, it's little wonder Fogo is popular among both tourists and locals alike -- but why not get your meat on for yourself and see what the hype is about? You won't regret it. ( Unless you either come in partly full or wearing tight pants, but that's not why I'm here to talk... )",

We went Sat afternoon before 2pm so it was considered 39.95 per person.  Kids were half price.  The food is just plentiful with a variety of cuts from sirloin to lamp chop.  Everything was nice and hot.  Nothing was sitting out there cold and stale.  We asked for medium rare on all our cuts and they were absolutely spot on.  The serves come often and at many points, we had to turn the card to red just because we wanted to take our time to savor in on the food.  The salad and fruit selection was top notch.  Service from all the wait staffs were attentive.  We never felt like we were overstaying our time.  Definite worthy comparison to the NY chain.  There is free parking and free WiFi.",

It also didn't help that everyone at my table wanted well done and medium and I wanted rare- so then when they did bring something new out they kept bringing the wrong doneness to whoever requested what. But it was VERY good and we all ate more than enough. The drink menu was lacking a bit and there was no dairy free options for deserts (which when you're keeping Kosher that's important). I like Texas De Brazil better because of the salad bar. Fogo's salad bar was really lacking in comparison.",

    "text": "Anticipating going here for lunch on the last day (they give you the entire month) for my birthday promotion. We finally made it here yesterday, New Year's Eve lunch, the last day of 2015. I wanted to get here early so we spent a few minutes in the parking lot, not knowing we could've gone inside to wait. Nice long curved couch style seating along the wall (like window seating) facing the bar decorated with a large Christmas tree, complete with wrapped gifts, our little man was curious. We were seated shortly near the massive wine cellar feature (beautiful design).   The salad bar was amazing: chicken salad (raisin topping, very good, but went around the raisins), smoked salmon (loved it), caesar salad (ok), black beans, sausage & rice (loved it), giant asparagus (loved it), manchego cheese (mmm), artichoke (seasoned, not marinated), sun dried tomatoes (good), imported salami (delicious), peppers, proscuitto, bacon, croutons, potato salad (delicious, hubby's favorite), tebouli salad, sliced fruit (orange, ruby grapefruit- really good), marinated mushrooms, and much more (I didn't try everything).  Now for the main event: the meats that we tried. Bacon-wrapped chicken (delicious), beef flank steak (my favorite, seasoned perfectly, hubby said it wasn't flavorful, but I just noticed it was not as salty as tdb), sirloin (tender), filet mignon (hubby's favorite), rib eye steak (hubby got a huge piece, said it was his 2nd favorite), sausage (our boy's favorite meat of choice but hubby thought it was just ok). We passed on the lamb and pork. Chilean sea bass is ala carte.  As for the service, it was excellent. Everyone was quick to take our dirty plates away, bring us more side dishes, refill our drinks, check on our satisfaction, asked if there was anything we wanted to request meat-wise. We also got complimentary flan for my birthday (entire month to use it), which was beautifully presented, happy birthday written in chocolate, lighted candle, orchid, whipped cream. It was delicious. I really enjoyed it.  The lunch dining crowd grew as we were seated. The salad bar is towards the back, right of center. Overall, the main dining room (large square shape) was nice, very dimly lit (romantic ambiance), with soft jazz music playing; along the sides were alcoves for semi-private groups. The wine cellar feature (fishbowl effect) was gorgeous, I kept looking at it. The bar was to the right of the hostess station. The bathroom was clean and orderly.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary on a Tuesday night. It was extremely busy so I'm glad we made a reservation. We still had to wait about 10 minutes upon arriving to be seated though. The salad bar had a variety of options such as fresh mozzarella cheese balls, prosciutto, assorted cheeses, Caesar salad, asparagus, soup, smoked salmon and capers, and  a lot more.   Save your stomach for all the meat though! There are many different people coming around with the fresh meat and ask you if you want any. They say it pretty fast and they are extremely quick so that was the only downside. You receive a little circular card on your table with one side signaling green \"yass give me meat\" or the other side is red meaning don't give me more. Haha.   The meat quality was delicious and my favorite was the house sirloin. It was so crispy on the outside and it paired well with the juice medium rare meat in the inside. I also really loved the lamb. I was pretty disappointed with the ribeye because I asked for medium rare and the guy that came over even said it was medium rare but it was very bland and on the well done side.   All the servers and staff seemed pretty stressed and the atmosphere was a bit hectic. But overall it was an okay experience. The food was good for the most part. For the two of us it came out to $130. I probably wouldn't ever come back again knowing there's some other spots in Vegas to get a similar experience for half the price.",

Sure enough; the flank steak guy walked by, did a whole lap around the restaurant twice without asking if we wanted some. Flank is some of the our favorites when eating Brazilian. We had to ask for it. Also, our waiter did not ask us if we had any requests or favorites. Texas De Brazil at town square at least includes free dessert, plantains instead of bananas, and constant meat flowing. The owner must be stingy because the corners that they cut were obvious and made the experience less rich.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had dinner here while we were in Vegas last week. We were only gonna have a casual dinner, so we weren't expecting too much. Turns out the food and services were absolutely amazing which surprised us a lot.   Service: There are a very wide selection of meat choices that servers go around and bring to your table. They gave you a piece of round plastic that is red on one side and green on the other side to indicate if you want to get served or not. The service was really fast once you turned your plastic piece to the green side. Our waitress constantly check on us and make sure we have enough water. The manager checked on us once as well and he is very friendly and approachable, we even chatted a bit while my boyfriend was in the restroom lol.  Food quality: Every single kind of meat is delicious, I especially liked garlic beef, simple name, but the meat tasted so soft and it melted in my mouth. The seasoning was on point as well. They also gave us 2 dishes for free at first. I am a bacon lover, they also have strips of bacon at the salad bar that are free to take as much as you can eat. The bacon is crispy and you can choose to put brown sugar on it which is served at the side. It was so satisfying. At last, we got dessert which is a piece of roasted pineapple and 2 giant scoops of ice cream. The pineapple was juicy and sweet, and the ice cream is in giant portion.   Environment: Spacious with a lot of people, not too noisy for such a huge restaurant.  Tip: Reserve a table if you will arrive after 8:30. They only take reservation after 8:30, there were a lot of people when we arrived after that time so it's still worth the time to call them beforehand.   Overall-10/10 would go again!",

Every time we come to Vegas, Brazilian Steakhouses our on our must eat list because my dad is a hardcore meat lover.  From the moment we walked in, I noticed how busy it was for a weekday. This place clearly means business. We were greeted by a staff member who was incredibly kind, I wish I got his name! Promptly got us our drinks and off we went to the salad bar.  My mom and I decided to order the mini tasting which included unlimited access to the salad bar and also came with a few ounces of one meat of your choice which then was the deciding factor to how much extra was added to your meal. My dad got the whole damn experience of unlimited meats and salad bar.   The salad bar does not disappoint. There is a TON of food there already, with lots of options! You can get really full, really fast from just the yummy treats at the salad bar. There was even a hunk of meat here for those that wanted a taste.  My mom and I ended up choosing the house special meat - the picanha. Our meat server asked if we wanted half of our portion now and half later, so it wouldn't get cold. I appreciated this since you're supposed to get all of it in one go. This is more than enough food to be completely honest, and it comes at a very reasonable price. However, for those that really want to taste all the different meats, by all means go for it. My dad was enjoying every minute of it.   All in all, I dig this place. It's definitely not something I could eat everyday, but every once in a while it's delicious. The decor is simple yet elegant, and overall, the employees at Fogo are top-notch. Their personalities are incredibly welcoming, which makes the experience even better. However, I'm knocking down one star because my dad said that a few meats were good in taste, but just meh in texture (hard, rough to chew, etc.) Regardless, I see my family coming here for many years to come to indulge in that classic Brazilian-style meat.",

If I were to rank them based on my opinion they would stack up as I have laid them out below.  Fogo de Chao - Overall best meats and service. Good deserts as well! Texas de Brazil - Great salad bar.  Meats can be hit or miss at times. Via Brasil Steakhouse - Good local hangout . Pampas Churrascaria - Pricey as it is located in the Casino. drinks are $$$! Yolies Brazilian Steak House - Think this one is gone :(  Because Brazilian style steakhouses are all about the meats. (Quality, selection, speed of service) We naturally chose Fogo as the leader. We have dined at all the others on the list 3+ times so I feel this review is accurate.  We have yet to dine at Samba on the strip but we eat out often and hopefully will visit next week.",

Having a Brazilian wife and having lived in Rio for two years, I feel I have a good idea of what it's all about.  While the salad bar is subpar...who the hell comes here for the salad anyway? It is the meat we seek and the meat was excellent, all the standard popular cuts, sirlon, fillett, skirt steak, pork, bacon wrapped fillet, chicken, sasuage...well you get my drift. All perfectly seasoned and with a side of the baked bananas in brown sugar.For dessert, stop at the first item on the menu, Crema de Papaya! OMG good!  The Manager came out to say hello, he is from Minas Gerias, and told us that they were opening two new stores, one near our home in San Francisco, the other in San Diego. Surely a special treat, but were better to treat yourselves than in Las Vegas?",

We waited at the bar.  40 minutes go by and I see the hostess, sort of stared at hwr in hopes she would notice and check up on things.  Almost an hour later I went up to her asn asked.  She said, \"I'm so sorry, oh i'm sorry.  I don't know what happened your name must have gone away.  My appologies, I'm so sorry\".  When we get sides the rice was out and a few other things were out as well, I did not bother to check if they replenished those dishes.  About 22 minutes into sitting down when we were almost full, they start bringing the meat.  Sort of defeats the very foundation of the purpose of an all-you-can-eat style of place.  At the end of the meal they brough a flan and appologized for the wait.  Take dinner for two, plus bar drinks, plus table drinks, tip, and that was an EXPENSIVE flan.",

There are some seriously yummy crispy polenta wedges and Brazilian cheese balls.  I continuously remind myself to limit my consumption of these items and hold out for the all-u-can-eat \"meat fest\".    The winning cuts are the rib-eye (juicy and the best cut of the night), the pork ribs (not charred or smoky enough, over-seasoned and too salty for my palate) and the sausage (very juicy and perfectly cooked).  The chicken and lamb were decent but a bit overcooked and not moist enough.  I really wish that SKIRT STEAK was on their menu.  Skirt steak is a meat that is difficult to overcook which work well in this type of grilling environment.  Their flan is amazing and makes my list of my top five flans of all time.    The servers are the best we've had at this type of steakhouse.  When we turn down a particular meat each server repeatedly asks what cut of meat we're waiting for and they promptly deliver it to our table.  Additionally, there are a TON of servers so your meal will not be a long one.  As a result, do not expect a relaxing and drawn out buffet type experience where YOU control the pace.  You know the restaurant's end goal is to get you in and out quicker.  I suppose everyone does win since you eat the cuts of meat you prefer versus getting impatient and settling on cuts which aren't your faves.    Next time I will show more patience and wait for a particular meat with the particular doneness I am seeking.  Also, we will wait it out and take a break so we don't miss out on anything.  We aren't amateurs to this type of steakhouse but I do feel we filled up early on this particular occasion.",

Most times I get only the market table and no meat because I'm not much of a meat-eater, but I always hear some great comments about the meats from those I go with. Mashed potatoes and plantains are both delicious too. Unique flavors make for a very tasty meal. Overall a great restaurant for anybody, well worth the cost each and every time.",

From the moment you walk in to when you're paying your check and leaving, everyone was just so pleasant and made us feel so welcomed to this restaurant.   The meat was overflowing so the red/green signal definitely helped direct the flow of meat. I was clueless at first, eventually got the hang of it and didn't miss out on a lot of meats. I guess we got lucky because we were seated by the meat source. We got first choice on some of the meats. Some were a little to rare for my taste. They also had a good spread of salad, bread, and cheeses.   Thanks Yelp Spring Break! Wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for your irresistible offer!",

Fogo de Chao serves up 15 types of quality meats that include beef, chicken, sausuage, and lamb.  In all you can eat quantities.  I think Fogo de Chao is Brazilian for food coma.  For someone that doesn't really do the buffet or all you can eat thing very often (outside of sushi), it surprises me that I've been to Fogo five times since they've opened.  Three of those visits have been within the last month or so!  Everything here is very, very tasty.  I don't normally eat much pork or lamb, but here it is a requirement.  Leave your preferences at the door and be sure to give every dish a chance.  I'd like to tell you what my favorite dish is, but it seems to change with every visit.  Everything is consistently good; there are times where things have been amazing.  There have also been a couple visits where I felt that things were too salty, which is quite a statement coming from me since I'm normally not that sensitive to salt.  Outside of those instances, dining at Fogo will leave you with one of the happiest food coma's you can ask for.  I'm totally a fan!",

First, the salad bar is massive to say the least with smoked salmon, variety of prosciutto, cheeses, salads, and green and white asparagus. But follow the advice: 1 plate only! You'll be excited but this is a marathon, not a sprint and you'll wanna save your room for the main event. Don't punch yourself out like they say in boxing.  When it comes to meats, go with the lamb chops, filet mignon, rib eye, and bacon wrapped filet. It's easy to wanna grab everything you see but a wise man once told me at a strip club- the key is to scan the room, take everything in, and strategically choose your meats; otherwise you'll be throwing in the towel before you know it.  The meats are well seasoned, delicious, serve how you like it. If you like it bloody, then they got it rare for you.  The service here is exceptional and this growing brand of Brazil steak dominance is here to stay.    I was a kid in candy store. My first experience was with Fogo nearly 15 years ago and I'm proud to say I'm a born again Fogo virgin!",

Not only was the food better than the other places, the service was excellent as well.  I started with a caipirinha which was very strong, but tasty.  Shortly after that, the meat starting coming.  Each cut was nice, hot, and juicy.  The servers constantly asked us if we had any special cuts that we wanted/wanted more of.  Things were so fast and furious that I was pretty full after 15 minutes.  I was determined to eat a good amount so I kept at it for another 20 minutes.  After that I was pretty much TKO on meat so I sat and thought hard about any specific cuts I really wanted to try again.  I had 1-2 more pieces and was done.  It's worth mentioning that the sides/salad bar were very good as well.  It's a nice break from all the meat.  It's not a every week type of place but once in awhile it's definitely a nice treat when you're craving some delicious meat.  It's worth a short drive off the strip!",

    "text": "**Summary** - Fogo is an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse chain. They bring the meats on skewers and cut it right in front of you. - All the meats were, for the most part, medium to rare. They were super juicy and not too salted. - My must haves would be the Picanhas, filet mignon (Not the one wrapped in bacon), and the beef ribs. - Prices - Lunch and dinner have exactly the same menu! You're saving $20 just for eating earlier. - Doneness - When the server cuts the meat for you, they give you a choice. However, it's usually between rare to medium. Just as a warning or a tip, rare is pretty rare. - By Request - All the meats rotate regularly with the exception of the Beef ribs and the garlic beef. - Decor/Mood - Classy and pampering. **Price** - $26.50 Lunch Mon-Fri 11:30am - 2pm - $46.50 Dinner Mon-Thurs 5pm-10pm & Weekend **Ordered** - Salad bar - The smoked salmon is a must. Other than that, it's just salads. - Costela - Beef ribs. They don't come around unless you ask for them. This is by far my favorite. They ribs have just enough fat in them. - Filet Mignon - There are two types. The huge steak filet was so tender words can't describe. The bacon wrapped one looked dry so I didn't try it. - Picanhas - House special and perfectly seasoned. - Cheese Bread - This place definitely has the cheesiest meltiest in your mouth bread. When they come hot out of the oven, I just want to eat it plain. - Beef Ancho/Alcatra/Fraldinha - Rib-eye/Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin. Cooked perfect and nice and juicy - Cordeiro - Rack of lamb. Pretty good, but I'd avoid it next time in place of better meats. - Costela de Porco - Pork Ribs. They were a bit dry and I'd stick to the beef ribs. - Lombo/Frango/Linguica - Pork Loin/Chicken/Sausage. Didn't really try it. - Garlic Beef - Didn't get a chance to try it. You have to request it. I found out too late. **Comparing** - If you've been to the other steak houses in town, here's a comparison section. - Texas de Brazil - Texas is saltier, the salad bars are about the same. The meats are dryer at Texas. - Via Brasil - Saltiness is about the same, the salad bar at Via has more hot foods and is more extensive. The meats are juicy, but Fogo has cuts that are more rare than Via. - Sides - Via Brazil has the most choices and better fried banana. Texas and Fogo have a limited selection. However, Fogo has the best cheese bread. - For lunch, nothing beats $26.50. It's hands down Fogo. - For dinner, it depends. If you like your meats rarer, I'd say Fogo. If you like your meats more medium-rare to medium, it's a coin flip. **Recommendations** - I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice treat for a special occasion or in the mood for a ton of perfectly cooked and savory meats.",

    "text": "Last night I ate here and man oh man! Was it filling! We had a reservation at 9pm and was sat as soon as we walked in (five before nine). We were showed the drink menus (minus one half of a  star because their list was small, and nothing seemed to jump out at us) then it was time to start the salad bar. The selection was brief, similar to Texas De Brazil. But also there was very small seafood selection. That takes away the other part of the star. But I came here for steak, so I can't complain too much because it delivered.   The only meat I wasn't a fan of was the chicken parmesan, it seemed dry to me but overall the filet mignon, sirloins, bacon wrapped sirloin, pork, everything was sooo yummy.   The best part was I love my meat rare, so everytime I asked for the rare cut they were all the same. Love the consistency.   The service was great she was constantly clearing the empty plates, and refilling the mash potatoes (they were soooooo good) I cannot remember her name. But she was very friendly, and all the workers move at a fast pace so it's crazy to see this place with all the food, tables, and people flying around. It's for sure a well oiled machine.   And finally we had a huge slice of cheesecake to spilt! Yummy! Our bill for two was 144$, so expect to pay over $100, the food was definitely worth it, service, as well!",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao... what happened? We had to ask our waiter if they stopped serving meat because we didn't see any table side meat servers since we arrived and it had been a while. When the meat did come we were pretty disappointed. The quality of meat was not that great or maybe it was the way it was cooked. Salty and chewy is the best way I can describe it.   We made reservations for 1pm but due to a standoff situation with police that took place on Las Vegas Blvd. it took us almost 2 hours to get there to eat. We didn't make it to the brunch which would have been an it discounted so we paid about $200 for 2 adults and 2 kids. The amount of effort and time it took to get there, we felt disappointed with the food.   I love the downtown Los Angeles location. This location was so empty. Only saw about 4 tables occupied. My daughter said right after we were done at this Las Vegas location that she wanted to go vegan. Maybe the food is just much better in Los Angeles. There are too many option to go to a place that isn't good.",

I did notice there were cuts of meat you had to ask for. Make sure you ask for the fillet mignon otherwise you might not get it or it comes out last and by then you are full! I thought the rib eye was the best out of all the meats. Don't like pork so we didn't try that. My son and husband loved this place but they are meat lovers.",

The brown sugar caramelized plantains they give you for sides were SO GOOD. Dessert was also delicious. I got a molten chocolate cake that had \"Happy Birthday\" beautifully written on it with a bday cake.  I would definitely come back here!",

But this is all after you enjoy their salad bar which they hope you fill up on first, prior to eating lots and lots of their very expensive protein served on very large vertical 3 prong forks loaded with lots of sodium, served and cut tableside to the temperature of your liking.  I've done all dem chain churrascarias and Fogo ranks near the top as far as the large chains go. Their selection seems to be consistently larger than the others and their protein to me upon various visits around the 48, is less sodium-er.   Their salad bar has a larger selection of seafood cocktails, cheeses, antipasti, and crudites to keep the veggie folks happy.  They get a solid 4 Yelps for consistency and being less sodiumey than the rest of the chains...  But as far as Churrascarias go, Plataforma in Manhattan has my heart. MMMMmmmmm their chicken hearts...yes!  THIS has been a review by Gaurav",

Unfortunately, while I enjoy meat I can only possibly consume so much and that happens to not be worth the cost of this place.   Somethings I didn't realize, I knew it would be pricey. But I thought for the price I would be served completely. The marketplace (salad bar) is one big mess of hungry people trying to fill up their plates. It's all cold items which really jerked me. I would have been happy with a nice side salad brought to my table instead of cutting in front of people at the salad bar. And it was all pretty meh stuff. There are a couple different soups I think. But that's it. Go back to sit down and then the meats roll in.  The meats were delicious, they bring three sides of what taste like instant mash potatoes and look like them too. Fried polenta was good, but we only got three sticks for both of us. The third side is plantain. I didn't try it, don't into warm bananas.  While I can see what the rave is about due to the endless meat, $140 dollars later I was very unhappy. It felt very hectic instead of just enjoying great food. We had buyers remorse.",

This was my first time experiencing a Brazilian steakhouse. The inside was decorated upscale and inviting. The service was outstanding from the minute we arrived until we departed. The salad bar was decent but I was there for the MEAT! My faves were the Filet Mignon, Cordeiro (lamb chops & leg of lamb), Costela (Beef Ribs), Costela de Porco (Pork Ribs) and Linguica (Sausage). Sides included pao de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas. I went really light at the salad bar and sides just to over indulge on the protein. Love how the meat is served hot and carved  to your cooked  request.   No room for dessert but I really enjoyed Fogo De Chao and will certainly return to one of their many locations.",

    "text": "Needing a break from the Strip, and having a deal through Yelp's Spring Break 2012, my wife & I had dinner here one night.  I made our reservation online and mentioned that it was our 5th wedding anniversary.  Their website was very easy to use, and I was able to make a reservation the morning of.  There is an ample parking lot, with complimentary valet.  Once inside, we were seated promptly.  Our reservation was for 6:30; the place was pretty full, but not completely packed yet.    After giving our drink orders, my wife & I hit the salad bar.  The first thing I noticed was the basket of bacon.  I really had to remind myself that bacon was only the appetizer, not the main course.  So I only put a few strips on my plate, along with some prosciutto, salami and mozzarella.  My wife took some olives, artichoke hearts and one of the salads (along with said bacon).  Once we sat down, we turned our signs to \"Go,\" and the flow of meat began.  While we tried a little of everything, my favorites were:  1. The Pichaha (the signature u-shaped cut) 2. The lamb chops 3. The linguica (sausage).  The staff were very friendly, checking on us often if we needed any more food or drinks.  But my favorite staff was the gentleman who was manning the alcohol cart.  We offered us any and all types of drinks, which almost made me cry again (after seeing the bacon basket).  Lastly, after we were finished with dinner, our server offered us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.  We chose the creme brulee, which came with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate with chocolate and caramel.  I thought that was a very kind gesture, which made our evening.  This was our favorite meal during our most recent time in Vegas.  I know we will come back again and again!",

The salad bar isn't something to write home about.  I think it's pretty ordinary, may be a little bit better than at Sizzler, but at least Sizzler serves soup and chicken wings in their salad bar.    I ordered the sea food, and it was moy delicioso.    For the meat eater in our party, they seem to have enjoyed their meals.  So, overall, it was a nice experience for every body.",

The fresh mozzarella seemed stale and dry.  Like it had been sitting a couple of days and the same with the potato salad.  The meat itself was decent.  I am very particular with my beef and need it well done.  So I told the one guy well done, he said ok I'll be back.  By the time he came back I had already turned my card over because I was finishing up what was on my plate and was getting pretty stuffed.  He came back about 15 minutes later and although my card was turned over to \"red\" he said well done?!  I said yes but I'm ok I'm full.  He still put it on my plate and it was beyond well done, it was outright charred and burnt.  That's all I could smell was burnt meat until the waitress took my plate.  Overall service was just ok.  No one went out of their way or smiled. Not sure If Ill return anytime soon!",

The place was packed, and service was super slow. We were past the first plate of food before the waiter even showed up to take drink orders or get sides (of which there are only plain mashed potatoes, super bland fried polenta, or sweet bananas. The salad bar was nothing special, with the only items of notice being the smoked salmon and the candied bacon. The rest was rather blah. But we're here for the meat, right ? First to the table was the bacon wrapped chicken that was so over cooked that it was totally inedible. Two later attempts from different skewers were better, but still very dry.  Pretty much none of the meat cuts were the requested temperature. I kept asking for medium rare, and half the pieces I got were rare or completely raw. I switched to asking for medium, and got either rare or well done. Biggest disappointment was the filet mignon. Early on, a guy showed up with three pieces left, one for each of our party. It was tough and full of gristle, not like any filet I've ever seen. This was the only time filet mignon ever made it to our table. \"Holiday Pricing\" for this debacle was $55. With one drink and one desert each, we ended up at $100 per head incl tax and tip - outrageous for the quality of food and service.  I don't even know why I gave this place 2 stars. I guess the candied bacon and the caipirinhas were ok.",

If you are looking to eating the food of Gods, this is the right place for you. Don't worry about diversity because at Fogo de Chao they have a wide variety of meats, fish, vegetables, soup and salads. Their salad bar is divine and their meat is well prepared by the chef, which is mostly likely to be a very good one, just like in the other restaurants they have around the world.  Let me remind you that I'm Brazilian and I love eating good food. I used to go to Fogo de Chao back in Brazil all the time,  specially during special occasions like birthdays etc.  If you are a hippie, a vegetarian, or even a vegan, Fogo de Chao will accommodate you too!!! However you might have to be dealing with some bloody red meat floating around :) so it might not be the best place for you if you don't really like looking at yummy tasty red meat.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, and together with Via Brazil, they carry on the good reputation of the real quality of an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse.   Just be careful to not engage in a food coma, and remember to order a Caipirinha cocktail! It's a Brazilian signature drink...  Have fun, and remember to order the Garlic Picanha, Flank steak, and  file wrapped in bacon...",

The bread was delicious, they have a sweet potato casserole that tastes like it has bananas in it-- it was heavenly.. Their beef ribs and lamb were my favorite meats. Our friends are regulars at this place so we got great service and the manager came to check on our table a few times.  I really enjoyed this place. I'll be going back.",

Waiters come up to your table with chicken, lamb, flank steak, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, ribs etc. Try not to get full from the salad bar though. It's great for a birthday dinner, anniversary, date or just because. You're guaranteed to leave full and satisfied! :) Great service!",

    "text": "Of all the Yelp promos I took advantage of during Yelp Spring Break, dinner at Fogo de Chao was the most memorable. This was my 1st time at Fogo de Chao or any Churrascaria, for that matter. I never knew what I was missing.  I made reservations, the girlfriend & I arrived on time, & we were promptly seated. Service was impeccable throughout. After we told the host that we were Churrascaria noobs, the manager personally came to our table & gave us the rundown.  In the most general terms, there are 3 food choices: some side dishes like cheese bread, mashed potatoes & polenta are automatically brought to the table; the salad bar; & the endless parade of meats brought directly to the table by the gauchos.  All of it is all-you-can-eat & all of it was outstanding. Most places with an all-you-can-eat salad bar stock that salad bar with lots of low cost filler. Not here. This Fogo de Chao salad bar had impressive Salmon & Charcuterie platters.  I made 1 visit to the salad bar & wanted to go back for more, but the meats the gauchos kept bringing were undeniable. That night, there were 16 varieties of beef, pork, lamb, chicken & sausage that were coming fresh out of the kitchen & being brought directly table-side.  It was a non-stop carnivore's carnal feeding frenzy of fleshly delights. So much meat. So good. So very good. Before coming to Vegas this time, I had decided this trip would be strictly \"no buffets.\" But it was too late now & there was no turning back.  Fogo de Chao is awesome. The whole Churrascaria concept is awesome. Yelp is awesome for the Yelp Spring Break promo offer that got me to try Fogo de Chao for the 1st time. Sadly, there's no Fogo de Chao near home for me. But if I'm ever near 1 again, I'll definitely go out of my way to go back for more.",

This in itself was super unexpected and much appreciated. This is not where my review ends...it gets better. Tonight (about ten days later) we wanted to come here for dinner, but I couldn't find my complimentary gift card that Milton had given me. I called the restaurant to see if Milton was there, but he wasn't so the wonderful hostess transferred me to Mauricio the manager. He was able to confirm this for me and when we came in for dinner he came by the table to say hi, checked back in with us to see how it was and he brought us a complimentary desert with thank you written in caramel. So sweet!  The food is always delicious, but with great service like this we won't go anywhere else!",

The rack of lamb is outstanding but they don't serve seafood other than the smoked salmon at the salad bar that I thought could have been cooked longer and the shrimp cocktail wHich is not included in the price for dinner its only alacart. The selections at the salad bar could have been better.  In my opinion Fogo comes in second to Pampas because Pampas serves seafood (bacon wrapped scallops) their salad bar has more selections of hot items and they have this delicious grilled sweet pineapple. Only thing Pampas is missing is the rack of lamb.",

Prime rib, sirloin, filet, chicken, pork - out of the churrascarias I've been to, I think Fogo's has the best meat (it's seasoned just right and tastes very good).  I think the attractive part of Fogo's is the meat. I was not impressed by the salad bar. Though it was presented clean and beautifully, there weren't that many selections to choose from. (Just some cold cuts, cheese, asparagus spears, potato salad, some rice, and beans). There was no fruit or other deliciousness.  The meal came with complimentary mashed potatoes, polenta, and pao de queijo. I enjoyed the warm goodness of the pao de queijos the most.   Come here if you're looking mostly to dine on tasty meats. If you want appetizers or other side dishes, or even a salad bar with more offerings, go elsewhere. As it is, though Fogo's has the best churrascaria meats so far, I'm not sure it was worth the price (pretty expensive - $28.50 + tax per person for lunch).",

The quality of the food was phenomenal; although, the salad/appetizer bar didn't have too much to offer in my opinion. Also, the piece of filet mignon I was given was a bit dry. The top sirloin was my favorite. It's the most popular cut and it definitely speaks for itself. If you join the e-club for this restaurant you receive $15 off of your bill on a weekday!

You sit at the table and wait for them to bring out all kinds of goodness (bacon-wrapped filet, sirloin, chicken, etc.).  If you likey, you take your tongs and grab a piece.  It's kind of like being at a strip club, though, where they shove a huge thing of meat in your face and... WHAT THE HELL AM I SAYING!!!!  Constant pressure to wave them off. \"I'm fine, thanks.  I just can't fit it all in my mouth.  It's way too big... and... and... nevermind.\"  A few tips before you go (and you should)...  1. Ignore the salad bar.  Focus on the prize. 2. Load up on the beef rib.  The other cuts are tasty, but you want the rib.  Trust me. 3. Drink lots of wine to block out all the debauchery 4. Unbutton your pants 5. Lose all inhibitions.

So she went in the kitchen and said something to the chef.  Ten minutes later, she came out with a plate of fried rice!  And the hubby said it was better than a lot of Chinese restaurants.  That's what you call customer service!  I've never had this type of service, ever.    The quality of the meat is pretty good.  We came in for lunch and it is well worth the $26.50.  Both my hubby and friend mentioned that they are willing to pay the dinner price for this dining experience.  They were both hesistant at first, but once they sat down, they knew that they were in for a treat.  All the meat were juicy and flavorful.  I prefer a little more salt, but that's an easy fix with the salt shaker at the table which elevated the flavor even more.   All in all, a wonderful dining experience.

    "text": "I had heard about Fogo de Chao before but never had an opportunity to visit this restaurant before. While visiting Las Vegas last week I was running low on cash and decided to find my closest bank on my phone's GPS. While driving to the bank my girlfriend spotted Fogo by pure accident. Since our plan was to go to the bank then decide of a place to have lunch, and since I wasn't going to spend on gambling I figured we'd have lunch at Fogo.  This is by far the flashiest, most upscale restaurant I've been to. The atmosphere was very calm and pleasant that afternoon. Unlike many restaurants that assign one waiter/waitress to a section of the restaurant, Fogo has its staff attending all tables. Their buffet has plenty to select from and they keep the famous Brasilian bread pao do queijo (cheese bread) coming. They have special waiters dressed in gaucho (southern brasil cowboy) outfits walking by the tables with different kinds of meat cuts on long metal skewers serving you at your table. I believe they say they serve 12 or 14 different types of meats. The fillet Mignon was unbelievable.  The restaurants presentation is very nice and clean. Lights were a bit dim which made the atmosphere perfect for a lunch date with my girlfriend; although, I can only imagine dinner would be a lot more busy, active and loud for a romantic atmosphere. Towards the end of our lunch several parties had come in for lunch and it wasn't as quiet as when we had walked in.  For those in my friends list or the L.A. area, there is a Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills. If my mind serves me right, lunch for two came out to like around $35-$40 per person. Dinner hours tend to be more expensive so expect to drop a pretty penny. Overall, this is an experience I'd recommend but it isn't cheap. We should treat ourselves to something nice from time to time, splurge, and a meal at this restaurant is a nice way to do that.",

    "text": "I've eaten several times at many restaurants in this chain: Washington, D.C., Beverly Hills, San Diego  I have never had a negative experience until we ate at the Las Vegas one this past weekend. I made a reservation weeks in advance. It was my husbands birthday and we have four children, 8- 21 years of age. This is usually a great choice for us as a family when we travel. The LV location however gave us the worst possible seat in the place, despite me calling ahead TWICE to confirm a nice table for a special occasion. We sat right inside (like 6feet) the front door. Temperatures were in the 30s that night; a cold blast of air hit us and our food every few minutes the whole meal. I had coats later on top of the kids to keep them warm while they are. We asked for a different table. We were asked to go wait in the hostess area for two hours if we wanted a different seat. The salad bar was half empty of most choices- items were empty most of the evening. The meat was slow to arrive and stopped eventually even though we were displaying \"green\". Finally, my husbands birthday dessert arrived- despite the call ahead to inform them of his diabetes, they showed up with a high sugar dessert :/ In Vegas, you expect MORE service. This location sadly offered LESS.",

They had a salad dressing that was green, I believe it was cesar with cilantro it was absolutely delish!!!  Now at your table you have a coaster, one side is red and one side is green.  When you flip it over to green watch out cause they will be coming at you with all cuts of beef, chicken, sausage, pork, lamb... oh my!  It was very tasty... was TRYING to try everything but it might be impossible for some.  So I had to flip my coaster back over to red!!!  You are also brought sides to go with your carniverous plate... we were served fried polenta, mash potatoes, fried bananas.  You can also opt to go back to the salad bar where they have fried red potoates, rice and black beans.  All in all was a delicous experience.  I know you might ask how was the desert??? and  yes we did do deserts.  We shared the creme brulee, oh my so light and tasty, the chocolate molten lave cake ala mode another fav at our table.  You may not have to eat for 2 days after you've been here!!! This place is great fun for a larger parties!",

    "text": "I travelled from Prescott, Az to Las Vegas to take my husband to this restaurant for a romantic dinner. The reviews were stellar and he loves brazillian steakhouses. We had been once before and really liked it. However, this experience was less than stellar. Almost every cut of meat that was served was bland and charred, no matter what rareness we requested. Little to no flavor. The meat was also tough and hard to chew, not tender and great as it should have been for a restaurant that specializes in meat.  The chicken was so dry that it crumbled under my fork. We tried every meat that came by, and I can honestly say that out of 8 meats, we only enjoyed one or two. The service was great though, the waiters were very attentive, quick to refill drinks and very friendly. Kudos to the staff. The biggest problem here besides quality, was price. I don't mind spending good money on great food, the kind of meal you remember for a long time. What I don't care for is spending almost $200 on charred, bland, mediocre food. This visit really disappointed.",

Don't get me wrong this place is great, in fact a person in our party was in awe and thought this was the greatest place ever.  Me on the other hand was comparing to the other place and IMHO this place fell a little short. The salad bar was fine but the meat service was a little slow.  I had to call over a few of them over to get some meat.  They were actually going to walk right past us if i didnt. We were right in the middle of the action so it wasn't like we were in a far corner and we all had our green side up.  most of the cuts were fine but all the filets, reg and bacon wrapped, we're like beef jerky.  Yes i did ask for med rare. Sad cause that's my favorite.  Also the sausage was more like breakfast sausage. I love the brazillian sausage from tdb. On the upside drinks came fast and the creme brulee was delish. Overall it was ok but I like the other place better.",

It is the only time I've ever heard him express how much he enjoyed a meal. The salad bar had a great assortment and everything was fresh. The basil salad dressing was a nice change from the typical choices. The meats were tasty and seasoned without masking the flavor. Side dishes were served at the table and if you didn't eat them before they turned cold, they were replaced with warm dishes of the same. We never waited for food. There was always wait staff there with the next meat choice before you could empty your plate. The only complaint would be the noise of the other patrons around us. The acoustics are not good and seem to amplify the din. But it was Saturday night in Vegas. That said, it was still the best meal we have ever eaten. We will definitely go back. It also comes with dessert. We were so full that we didn't want it, but the waiter talked us into splitting a creme brulee. However, he also brought out flan. It was absolutely the best flan ever.

Ricardo was our waiter, and he was such a nice guy and provided excellent service.

Food-wise, its was great, I would give it 4 stars, however our waitress I'll give 2 stars, and here is why: Unfortunately we were dealt a very \"pushy and present\" waitress. For example, we asked for the Mango caipirinha, and she basically talked us out of it, saying it's not very popular, we should instead have the one with Amaretto but my wife said she didnt like Amaretto. So we asked for the original. Next, the waitress comes back with the one with Amaretto, saying \"I brought this one anyway, since I know you'll like it, you can not taste the Amaretto, and if you dont like it I'll bring you the other one\". Well, needless to say, my wife didnt like it, so we had to get her to bring the other one.   There were many more examples, like asking if a particular person wanted more wine while at the same time starting to pour it. Taking plates and dessert orders while one person was still finishing the meat. And at some point she was even dissing a meat server right behind us after he put the meat directly on the plate. The experience just became such that we tried to avoid at any cost to have the waitress come to our table for any thing.  Unfortunately, the waitress we had overshadowed the quality we think this place had.",

    "text": "We went here for restaurant week.  First impressions, when walked in, there was a fire pit with cuts of meat rotating around it. I felt my inner primal caveman doing cartwheels. I knew it was going to be a good day!  The hostess was very cordial. The restaurant was beautiful. Very clean design with tall ceilings and very open floor plan.   It was a little pricey for lunch $30.12 but it was worth every penny.  I was worried about what my vegetarian GF was going to eat. Browsing the menu online, they offered a salad bar. Again, a little pricey  for lunch $19.95  I have to say, hands down, it was the best salad bar i have ever seen.  All of the food was delicious and the vegetables were very fresh.They also had some delicious cured meats, great cheeses including a whole wheel of Parmesiano Reggiano that was flaked into large chunks My GF was very impressed with all of the selections. She was happy, thus everyone was happy.  Now to the good stuff, aka the meat! As with Brazilian Steakhouses, you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. Green means \"bring on the meat\" and red means \"not right now\". When i turned it to the green side, it was if the servers who were dressed in traditional Gaucho outfits came out of the wall with giant skewers loaded with deliciously fire roasted meat selections. All of the selections i tried were perfectly seasoned and cooked.The stand out were the lamb chops. My GF asked me if i needed some alone time as my eyes rolled int the back of my head after my first bite. I truly ate like a caveman pushing the carbs aside. Although I did have a spoonful of the mashed potatoes because they looked too good to pass up.  The dessert was included. I thought there would be no room for dessert but we both found our spare dessert stomachs. She had the creme brulee and it was decadent, rich and delicious. I had the strawberry creme which was topped with some Creme De Cassis.  It was delightful and very delish. Since it had strawberries in it, i was telling myself that it fresh fruit and good for me. That's my story and I am sticking to it!  The service is top notch. They had so much staff, when i pushed my plate aside, it was quickly whisked away and a new one was given to me just as fast.  Our waters and iced teas were kept full the whole time. The server was very knowledgeable and pleasant.   My GF told me I was going to go into a food coma when I got home and as usual, she was correct. I think I am still full and we ate there yesterday.",

I said yes, I would like more cooked meat, and he must have yelled at somebody because we just had servers after servers come up to us with well done meat.",

I love how the servers pedal their cuts. Very amusing.   I love my steaks practically mooing so I am not usually a fan of rodizio, but if you tell the waiters they will make sure to come back to your table when someone else has taken the more well done slices.  All in all a decent value for what you are getting. I prefer to go to non-chain restaurants but Fogo is consistently high quality and when Grandma is paying you don't complain about free meat!",

    "text": "There are some meals that you have that you know you will remember for years to come. This was my experience at Fogo de Chao.  I had the good fortune to join a longtime friend who had done very well at the tables earlier that day. This meant that our meal started with the best possible aperitif: a 2 oz pour of MacCallan 30, which pretty much went into a barrel when I was born. This now entitles me to a little bit of a humblebrag: Don't have 30-year-old scotch, because it will make enjoying anything less FAR more difficult.  Onto the meal. Skip the salad bar, as you will want as much room as possible for the wonderful meats. I have listed them here in order of preference. Full disclosure, however: our wine pairings took this meal from excellent to legendary. We had an '08 Brunello and then an '06 Insignia Meritage. Also not recommended if you ever want to enjoy red wine again.   LOMBO (parmesan-crusted pork loin) - This was an incredible dish. Tender, juicy, perfectly prepared pork, and with just the right amount of parmesan covering the pork loin to flavor it and add a bit of texture.  FILET MIGNON - this is my go-to dish at pretty much any steakhouse, and although I normally like mine prepared medium, it's only the upscale places that do medium-rare that I still eat. So I asked for medium-rare, and got a piece that I was slightly uncomfortable with visually, but it was STILL amazing. It's also served wrapped in bacon, and while I like bacon, the filet by itself is outstanding.  CORDEIRO (lamb leg) - this comes as both leg of lamb, and lamb chops. I only had the leg, and it was divine. Not even a hint of gaminess.  FRALDINHA (bottom sirloin) - It never occurred to me that \"top\" sirloin had a \"bottom\" counterpart, but this was it. It's incredibly well-marbled and, for someone who is careful to cut out any extra fat visible on any cut of meat, I didn't leave a trace of this behind.  PICANHA (top sirloin) - I had the garlic-seasoned version of this dish, and while it was very good, it was still outdone by the dishes above. Apparently it's one of their signature offerings, but it kind of got lost in everything else that was at or above its level.  There were plenty more meats that came by our table, but after the above I skipped most of them. Word to the wise: don't come to a place like this and take up valuable stomach space on chicken.  For dessert, we had the flan -- very good and with a generous amount of sauce. But the fried bananas can easily be your dessert here.  Our service was excellent. I was with company that knew a LOT about wine, and he was impressed with how each of the servers (not just the sommelier) knew a lot about the selections we had made. We felt very well taken care of, as was sort of expected, and very much appreciated.  This wasn't just a dinner. It was an experience, and an unforgettable one at that.",

I don't remember it being that great, probably why I haven't been back. Since that was close to 20 years ago, I decided I want to try this place for my birthday (was going to go to Envy Steakhouse). Nice interior. Great salad bar. But I was SO DISAPPOINTED with the overcooked, dry meats! I can honestly say that every thing I tried was dry! Oh the beef wasn't dry - JUST RAW! The only meat that I liked was the garlic beef I believe. The ribeye was sliced so thin and lacked flavor or marbling. The bacon wrapped beef was RAW, the bacon wrapped chicken was DRY as EFF! And the ultimate foul was the  ovecooked, DRYASEFF Lamb t-bones! A travesty! I didn't even eat it! The rib was tasty just wanted some dipping sauce! For the price, I can not recommend. Well, I can't recommend AT ALL!  The waiters were attentive to our needs, although I would have liked a new plate. I just expected not-burnt  or raw meat to be served at a churrascaria! BOO!  Oh the Brazilian lemonade is the SHEE-YAT! The sides were bland.",

Beef, lamb, pork, chicken....they've got it all and its all at a fixed price so be prepared to arrive with a healthy appetite.  Great for people who love eating ton of food.  They also have a salad bar, included in the price or you can order just the salad bar and forgo the meat.  When you've had enough, simply flip over your red-green disk to red and the meat servers will stop hovering.  Salad bar was extensive, with all kinds of meats, cheeses, salads, toppings -- enough for a meal alone without the meat madness.  Good atmosphere, friendly servers.

I honestly can't remember all the types of meats I tried because I liked them all! My favorites were the House Sirloin and Top Sirloin. It was marinated perfectly and tasted great with the Chimichurri sauce. I like my meat medium cooked and all of the meat was cooked to my liking. My absolute favorite part about my meal were the cheese puffs. They were little puffs of heaven! I must have eaten about 20 of them!  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I enjoy the salad bar offerings at Texas de Brazil more. Don't get me wrong, they had a variety of salad items such as fresh cut salmon, cheeses, prosciutto and roasted potatoes.. but there is something about Texas de Brazil's Lobster Bisque that I crave.  Service was exceptional. We had a large party of eight adults and two babies. I like that they had high chairs and car seat slings. They were quick to refill our drinks and replenish our cheese puffs and sides. Best of all, they kept the meat coming!  This is a good place to go for large parties. They have long tables and private rooms. Just try not to go to the salad bar the same time as a party of 20.   I would definitely recommend Fogo to my meat loving friends.",

    "text": "This was my first time dining at one of these Brazilian Churrascarias which there are several of in Vegas now.    I do have somewhat of a mixed feelings about this kind of eating as I do with many buffets in Las Vegas.  Basically, this is a huge steak buffet where you don't have to get off your seat as they bring it to you.  I actually liked the salad bar.  It has a good selection of cold cuts, cheese, and other cold things to pick from that were of good quality.  Just don't fill up on this stuff as flood of meats is coming.    I think I pretty much tried everything except for some chickens as I'm more of a red meat person rather than white meat.    I would say that the quality of the meat is pretty good, and what you can't experience in regular steakhouses that you can here, is that you can taste about 6, 7 different cuts of meat at one setting.    The huge problem I have with this, is that for those of us who prefer to eat our meat medium rare to rare, this type of serving meat makes this very difficult.  What they do is shave a piece off of a large piece on a skewer, so it is impossible to get a thick piece of meat cooked to your liking.  There were some cuts like filet where they do give you a large chunk, but it seemed that these were all overcooked, even though I asked for medium rare.    After a while I was going into redmeat coma and it really didn't matter what I was eating.  This is the problem with buffets.  There is just too much food to a point that I start losing focus, and you just can't \"feel\" that the chef is putting everything on the line to give it his/her best, because they just have to keep the food going out.    If you are a 22 year-old who want to load up on decent meat at buffet prices, then this might be great, but for those of us who are used to quality \"steaks\" in this town, it doesn't quite do it. I fortunately did NOT have to pay for this meal, but for $47 or so per person, I can't see myself going back.",

I was going to just get the salad bar at first, but at $22 a person, I might as well try the entire experience for $45. I wasn't impressed with the salad bar, I think I've had a better selection at Sweet Tomatoes, so that was a letdown. Then the meat started coming, and it was like meat overload. Nothing really was spectacular, honestly the only piece of meat I liked was the lamb. The best part of my experience here was the 3 caipirinhas.   For dinner and 3 cocktails, my bill was $110. Really? Not a chance I would ever go back and spend that again, for that kind of money I will go to a restaurant on the strip.   I gave one star for service, they were on top of it. And another star for the food not being bad. Guess this place just wasn't my thing.",

Texas the most amazing Salad Bar of any Buffet in Las Vegas with virtually the same meat. 14 cuts to be exact.  With that being said, the meat at Fogo is a hair tastier. Minus the hair in it. All the cuts here are very lightly seasoned as oppose to Texas which heavily salt their meat. I like my cuts medium-rare so lightly salted tastes better. Towards the end of the meal when I like it medium well, so the heavily salted-seared pieces are better. This only works with their Rib-eye here. In fact, I will only want to eat Rib-eye here. It's their best cut. And they sure give generous portions per cut.    So with a poor Salad bar and slightly tastier meat, why a 5 stars? The lunch time menu! Everything is the same for 50% off M-F. AMAZING! If this place was closer to me. I'd be here once a week!",

The experience of sitting down to start with drinks and the buffet is a nice way to dine, but feels more like an attempt to up-sell very marked-up wine. Some buffet items are good like the apple salad, basil sauce, or the smoked salmon, but the best thing from my experience is learning that I love filet minon for the tenderness. However, I realized then that although it is tender, it is not very flavorful and it explains why they use a lot of seasoning and then wrap it in bacon. So, I would say go here if you are a meat lover and want to try different meats. Otherwise, spend the $50 on a nice cut at the butcher to cook at home.",

The meat is actually cooked right, is flavorful, seasoned correctly, and tender.  The salad bar is fresh and solid, not so overwhelming like that other chain at Town Square.  The service was attentive without being really annoying, which I've complained before at other Brazilian steakhouses.  Drinks were refilled instantly, fresh plates were offered as needed, chairs were pulled out, and everyone was so friendly and helpful.  My husband made a special request for meat that wasn't out on the floor, and they went back and cooked it fresh just for him.    My only real big complaint was the price - very expensive at $45.00 a person, but when the manager thanked us for coming on opening night and gave us both certificates to not only come again for free, but to bring two more people, I thought that was pretty cool.  Really happy with Fogo - the only churrascaria I'll go to in town.",

    "text": "I have frequented the Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills and was pleasantly surprised to receive a letter from the manager of Beverly Hills to dine at the new Fogo de Chao in LV. I invited some friends to come along and we had a very enjoyable meal and very comparable to the quality of the Beverly Hills restaurant. I've been to many brazilian bbqs in LV and in Southern CA and Fogo is definitely on the higher end of quality meats. They may not have as large a selection as some other places, but their meat quality and light seasoning is definitely better that others. I was not reaching for water as much as I do compared to other places (like Texas de Brazil) since they over season/salt their meats.   Being a new restaurant, the decor and ambiance was very nice. The service was great as it appeared they had a lot of staff that was extremely attentive to everything that you needed - whether it be a refill on your drink, a new plate, more meat, or something else from the salad bar. They also kept bringing refills of the sides - the mashed potatoes and the fried bananas. Also the cheese bread is one of the best! My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that their salad bar is lacking in selection. The Beverly Hills location definitely has a larger bar with more variety and I know that some of the other restaurants (like Texas de Brazil) have more selection. However, the place is for meat-eaters, and so perhaps less selection could be a good thing.  Overall, we were all happily stuffed from a very enjoyable meal and will definitely be back for another round soon.",

    "text": "Dined here with family and loved it. Centrally located with valet or self parking. The service was amazing and the servers were extraordinarily accommodating. I wanted tiny tastes of the meats and they obliged without pushing more food on me than I wanted.  The servers were friendly and in the know re the menu options and immediately cleared plates and brought fresh plates. The sides served on the table were fantastic. I especially enjoyed the chicken and filet.  Loved that the meats were not heavily sauced or salted.  Everything on the salad bar was fantastic - the smoked salmon, hearts of palm, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus , cucumber salad, artichoke hearts and cheeses were standouts for me. Some  reviews I'm seeing favor other Brazilian steakhouse salad bars over Fogo's, but I loved Fogo's due to the variety of healthful options. After all, if I\"m going to go a bit protein crazy for my entree, having some fresh vegetables not dripping in oil or sauce is a good thing!   That being said, the crispy polenta served as a side was outstanding and the rolls on the table were fabulous. (Bread has to be really \"worth it\" to me to spend the calorie real estate -- these were!) I was impressed by the wine selection and the by the bottle, half bottle or by the glass options. We had no stomach real estate room but the in-house-made desserts certainly seemed appealing -- many options.  I love the fact that they have a lunch option as well that is quite affordable. I left my meal feeling content and not feeling sick or stuffed. And the scale didn't show damage the next day, either.  Kudos to Fogo!",

Well, this past month I was in Vegas and decided to go  there with my boyfriend. It was his birthday so def wanted a nice casual place with good food! The staff was very attentive and sincere. The food was amazing but I didn't really enjoy the salad bar too much. The side dishes were amazing! The manager saw one of our meats too cooked ( I like my meat med rare) and he made sure we didn't eat the one we were served. So observant the manager was! He brought out fresh cooked meat right away. We def enjoyed our time here and when I visit Vegas again I would go back. Food and good service is a must at all restaurants. Fogo de Chao impressed me with the quality and service. ohh and our papaya ice cream at the end of our meal hit the spot. Thanks!",

The servers are not that professional. The food it meh compared to TDB. There is not a lot of variety at the salad bar. The server had no idea about the wine list...he just pointed to a $250 bottle! To be brutely honest I would prefer TDB if I wanted to try a Brazilian steak house. The decor and environment at Fogo feels like your in a casino buffet dining room. Its loud ,especially with the servers yelling at each other right at your table. Fogo is good for getting you seated quick , getting your food quick and ordering expensive wine and getting you out the door QUICK! i felt rushed  having three servers ask if they can take our plates for us and clearing our table when we weren't even done our wine. Ahh well I guess paying $50.00 pp is cheap in VEGAS? lol If you want to spend this money and have a way better meal and experience, head to Texas De Brazil. Its  little further from the strip, though it is so well worth it.",

I love the fact that they give you sides and they keep replenishing it!  The price was decent but we went during restaurant week so I am not sure what the real price is.  But this is some place I would like to go back again!  The lamb was ok but the sirloin was everyone's favorite!  The coffee was good and desserts were all yummy.  Because there was a group of us we got to try almost everything.  We had the Papaya ice crea, flan, creme burlee, chocolate molten and cheesecake with strawberries,  Everything was really good and not too sweet!  The papaya ice cream was very settle and not too sweet but you would have to let it \"marinate\" in your mouth to recogonize the flavors.  I would suggest that they do not put too much raspberry sauce.  The cheesecake was very rich but not in a bad way, the texture is smooth and melts away in your mouth.  The chocolate molton was just enough chocolate without overwhelming your taste buds and both the flan and creme burlee was perfect!  The texture and the righ amount of sweetness!  Again I would visit the place again!  The servers were all very tentative and was great in pre-bussing the tables and getting all the clutter off the table as quickly and often as possible!  And our cups were never empty!",

    "text": "My first experience at a Brazilian restaurant was a hit. We were meeting friends there to begin our New Years Eve right. We had to valet, which was unnecessary. They had plenty of parking right out front. Seemed like their plan to get a few more dollars from you. There was no food menu. Everyone gets the same, which is fabulous. They serve each table with cheesy, soft, moist, golf ball sized breads. I absolutely loved them. I had to restrain myself. I could have filled up on them.  The salad bar was really good. Lots of great cheeses. They had crispy, thick bacon. My favorite part was the thinly sliced raw salmon. Each person has circular cardboard disc. Green on one side and red on the other. Green means you want meat and red means you don't. Some times it took a few minutes to get served, but most of the time they overwhelmed you with amazing meats. They had many selections. All fresh and cooked to perfection. They ask \"well, medium, or raw?\". Each skewer had all three temps. Everyone at my table liked the prime rib the best. I preferred the filet minion. I know I had too much. They raved about the chicken, but it paled in comparison to the meats. Ask for the Brazilian hot sauce. I cannot remember the name, but it looked like apple sauce. The mashed potatoes and bananas were served with the meat. It was good too.  The server was super friendly and really knew her stuff. She recommended desserts. She did not say that they were not included in the price. We tried the flan. None of us like flan all that much, but she did a great job recommending it. It was the best I ever had. Perfect texture: smooth and thick. The sauce was out of this world. It cost $8.50. I think the meal cost around $45. We split the cost among each other, which came to $75 each (included bottle of wine). I really enjoyed it and don't regret spending the money. However, there are so many great places in Vegas that are more affordable.  I would recommend this place to someone that has never tried Brazilian steakhouse and didn't mind splurging a little.",

I am so surprised, the meats weren't salted and the flavor was so bland.  Out of the 15 meats I tasted, I only liked the rib eye which was very fatty.  That is strange to me, considering it is a churrascaria.  The bananas.... Oh... it was like eating slimmy slimmy ewww.  I made them before and they were bad, but this was really bad.  The cheese bread was the best thing I ate and it wasn't even the real thing!  How can you mess up cheese bread!?  The salad bar was decent, however the potato salad didn't have flavor.  I have to say, I am disappointed at the taste of the food from this place and won't be returning.  I love churrasco, born and raised in Brasil, this food just won't cut it, it's an embarrassment.   Also, the caipirinha was bad.  The way this bartender made it is not the way it's supposed to be.  Caipirinha are meant to be sweet and lemony, this was bitter (???!!!).  However, on the positive note, the service was great.  But I still left hungry :(",

    "text": "One word... MEAT!! When planning our recent trip to Vegas, I was eyeing a few different places for dinner on Yelp and chose this as our first dinner of the stay. We were very pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a very helpful and friendly server who laid out the whole idea of dining at a Brazilian BBQ. His first suggestion (and a very good one) was to go LIGHT at the salad bar. The whole point of dining at this type of restaurant is being able to try a whole list (15) of different cuts of meats. Meats range from Chicken, Beef, Pork & Lamb cooked several different ways. I enjoyed each and every cut and left my seat barely being able to walk. If this wasn't such a nice place, it would definitely qualify as a stretchy-pants must. The fried plantains were so good that I saved them for last. Our server took the last bit that I had asked him to leave on the table, but brought out a brand new hot plate when he realized his mistake.. Score! The manager suggested a couple drinks to try and was spot on with his advice. The girlfriend ordered a Strawberry Lemonade cocktail (delicious) and I went with a Brazilian Beer that was a great suggestion. Be prepared to be a little overwhelmed with service for about the first fifteen minutes of your experience. It's just the nature of this place and all of the advice that you will receive from the staff is very helpful. Again, go LIGHT at the salad bar! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!! (For you PF fans ;)",

Upon arriving, parking was a nightmare! There were only about 20 spaces available to park, then all the other 50 spaces were coned off for \"valet\". Boo! We were seated right away, got our drinks, and hit the salad bar... Salad bar was mediocre. Salad, salami, potato and chicken salad, cold vegetables (broccoli and asparagus) fresh mozzarella balls, prosciutto,white rice and black beans etc. not impressive...it was pretty dark in the restaurant and very busy. People running around constantly! The cheese filled bread they bring to the table were lightly filled with cheese and airy... Generally, other brazil steakhouses let you choose your sides, but this one brought out fried polenta(dry and cold), mashed potatoes from a box, and fried bananas. The meat service WAS really good... Bacon wrapped filet and chicken, phenomenal Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin. The price was $49.00pp, $10 more per person then our preferred spot... They'll need to work on specials for the local scene. Overall a good experience, but I'll save the gas and go to our spot where it's more relaxed, with superior service and an awesome salad bar!",

I have noticed everyone else has said this multiple times, but I cannot stress enough how important it is to NOT fill up on the salad bar and the appetizers they serve you (mashed potatoes, french fries, and a dessert). You really will get so full on the meat because it's so heavy in comparison to everything else served. Don't get full on the salad bar and not be able to enjoy the reason you came to begin with!",

Our party of six stopped in for New Year's Eve dinner via a reservation made on opentable.  Our booking was for 6 p.m. and upon arrival we were seated promptly, with water brought and drink orders taken in short order.  This is the start of what would be a night of outstanding service at Fodo de Chao.   We begin our meal with the amazing salad bar, which is stocked to bursting without standing veggies, salads, and other delightful options.  Everything our party tried from the salad bar was fabulous.  With our salads consumed, we turned to the main event--the meat (and of course the accompanying sides).  The excellent wait staff at Fogo de Chao made sure that, when our cards were set to go, the meat came around quickly and continuously.   Everything we tried was delicious, with the fillet mignon, lamb and pork being particular highlights.  The sides were, as always, amazing.  I particularly enjoyed the fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread, but it was all good.   This restaurant also offers some excellent cocktails - with the cranberry cosmo a particular favorite.  And as I've said again and again, the service was outstanding.  This is the level of service that all Las Vegas restaurants should I aspire too, and I just can't say enough good things about the excellent team at Fogo de Chao who took care of us on New Year's Eve.  Overall, this was a dining highlight for us, and our family visiting from Australia, and we all had an amazing evening.",

We were taken to our seats and were attentively checked on by all the waiters and gauchos regularly from that point on.   Our waiter explained their ordering process and brought us our drinks. We started with the salad bar. We were careful not to fill up too much on all the delectables there, saving room for the mountain of meat to follow. Then it was time to flip our cards from red to green and prepare for the onslaught. All the cuts we tried were excellent. My favorites were the lamb chops, flank steak and the Picanha. There were a few cuts that were a little overcooked for my taste, but overall the food was fantastic. The cheesy bread was subtle and fantastic and I have to say that I loved the salad bar. I'd probably have no qualms coming back just to indulge in the salad bar while my fella protein-loaded until his heart's content. At the end of our meal, the restaurant manager came by to talk to us and make sure we enjoyed our meal. He even sent over some complementary flan for my fella's birthday. the flan was excellent. The service was perfection and the experience was exactly what I had hoped for. We'll be back.",

    "text": "OH WHAT A MEAL!!!!!  I've been to Fogo before in Philly and this one was just as good. I called beforehand and asked for directions, they told me \"it's right off the strip\". Silly me being an east coaster I decided to walk! *Admiral Akbar voice* it's a trap!!! Seriously, it's like half a mile and past some serious ghetto! So take a car/cab!  From the time you walk in you're greeted and seated. We had the best server on the planet, and the food, oh the food! Cuts of meat at your prepared temp and oh so flavorful. Let me say that this is NOT for everyone. Vegetarians and vegans will cry and if you have a girl who'd only order a salad your money would be wasted. You need to bring some serious carnivores. The meat and salad bar are all you can eat, but take it easy there, it'll take up valuable room from the meat *drooling just thinking about it*  Make sure you hit up fog while in Vegas, it's definitely worth the (taxi) trip",

We got there right when they were closing their doors at 10:30 but they were so gracious enough to let us dine.  Awesome, awesome, awesome cuts of meats..  My favorite was the sirloin and the beef rib.  I love their chimichurri and hot sauce--must try it!!   Awesome, friendly waiters/waitresses, and hostess. Was close to $55 per person but definitely worth all the all-you-can-eat Brazilian meat that is tenderized and flavorful.   Definitely can't wait to dine again on a future Vegas trip! Thank you Fogo!!",

The salad bar had plenty of options such as my favorites.....sun dried tomatoes,  maple brown sugar bacon,  fresh broccoli,  marinated zucchini  slices, sliced meats, fruit, and antipasta. Garlic mashed potatoes, polenta, and  carmelized bananas was provided for sharing.  You have a round card for each guest beside your plate. One side of the card is green ( which means you  want meat) and the other side of the card is red ( which means no more meat). Several  servers  walk around with any kind of meat you can think of, on metal skewers  ready to serve you.  Top sirloin,  filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, pork ribs, garlic steak, bacon wrapped  chicken, lamb chops, sliced lamb, pork sausage, ribeye steak are some of the many meats that is served throughout  dinner.  You are able to select  the temperature  you prefer for your meat selection.  This is just a brief  synopsis  of my brazillian experience, which was awesome.  I will definitely  return  again.",

For a few dollars more than the normal lunch price, you get  a choice of 3 desserts and a contribution is made to Three Square.  The salad bar has fewer items at lunch than dinner, but they have the most common items you'd want including hearts of palm, some excellent sliced cheese (one of my favorites), chilled asparagus, and other items besides greens for salad.  The servers come around with their skewers of meat.  Yesterday's hit for me was the garlic steak.  What great garlic flavor!  I also enjoyed some lamb chops, boneless chicken breast wrapped with bacon and pichana to name a few. In addition, you have some of the cheese puffs to start out and you get sides of mashed potato, fried and glazed plantain, and polenta sticks.  For dessert, I chose the turtle cheesecake which was very good.  This is a very solid, well priced coma-inducing lunch.  You want to come home and sleep for an hour or so just as you did after your mother's holiday dinners when you fell asleep during the football game.  I like this place!",

I am fairly often in the vicinity of this place (it's by my favorite starbucks) I've always wanted to try it. I finally did it.    This place was really good. I liked the decor. Very clean yet robust-like. They have a pretty good selection of wines.   Now for the food. The meat was solidly good. The salad bar selection was very good. I liked the smoked salmon, the wild mushrooms, the cheeses, and the simple sliced tomatoes. The cheese bread that is automatically brought to the table was yummy. The fried banana was very yummy. The service excellent!!! They were all professional. Had this little pep in their step. They chatted with their guests.   The minuscule issues that I had were. The hostess didn't smile when greeted (I know it's petty but it does make one feel a little awkward approaching such). Another; I've been to churrascarias before and I was aware of the turning the wooden peg over to be approached by the meat-handlers. There was no peg but a coaster of which I was made aware of such after sitting a while and not knowing what to do.",

This is probably to fill you up so you do not eat as much meat but the quality is so high my sister was able to have just the salad bar for dinner.  The sides include fried polenta sticks, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. The fried polenta sticks were the best, they taste like a high end fry.  Now, the meat! All of the meat was excellent. The best was the house special that night which was prime sirloin. The bacon wrapped filet mignon and bacon wrapped chicken are also great. The flank steak had a great taste. They also had pork sausage, leg of lamb, parmesan pork, and sirloin steak. The meat is high quality and it never stops. At one point I was extremely full and still continued to eat because of how great it is.  This is quality and quantity for your money.",

I wouldn't spend this much money again. Some people may really enjoy but it just wasn't great for me. I did want to try the ribs but it never came to my table. The sausage wasn't anything great either and I love sausage.",

We noticed that when they brought out better cuts such as ribeye, they skipped our table. We asked about the shrimp cocktail and the guy acted like we couldn't afford it. There were meats brought out on cutting boards, but when we tried asking about it, we were ignored! That was extremely rude. The market table wasn't impressive either. Maybe my expectations were too high. My husband was not impressed this being his first time...and probably his last.  Maybe Via Brasil spoiled me because this place wasn't worth the money.

Jose took such great care of us, explaining the menu, the different selections, how it worked as it was our first time and went out of his way to find our choices of meat when we hadn't gotten them yet. He and all of the staff were so attentive! Ugh, and the food. We tried everything and it was so amazing. Stand outs were the top sirloin, filet mignon, parmesan crusted pork loin and the lamb chops. It was all so delicious and we were so full. They knew we were celebrating a birthday and gave the birthday girl a complimentary dessert of her choice (there are a lot of desserts to choose from!) The staff made sure this was a night we would never forget and we cannot wait until the one back home in Washington opens, we'll be the first in line!  Our only confusion was this waiter who walked around with a huge shrimp cocktail but never did anything with...it didn't affect our night at all, but it was entertaining watching him walk around.

They said they were running a bit behind and couldn't give us a time frame for when we would be seated. Which is fine, I get things happen. BUT there was no apology on their delay, they didn't check up on us while we waited 40 min. And I made sure to call that day to confirm our reservations.

We used to go to TDB all the time until a friend recommended us here so we gave it a try and I can't even begin to tell you how much of a difference it is in the meats and the service. Most of all service is 70% of what matters really also the food of course but how they treat you and the experience they give you is the real deal. Dined in with my wife and two other friends and we're right away greeted by our server Min and he was such a gentleman pulling out our wives chairs for them and ours as being seated. First impressions are very important and that alone already wowed us and we knew we were in for a treat. We started out with seafood as an appetizer that was just awesome because we didn't know such a steakhouse would have such a thing but it was a beautiful tower of lobster,crab, shrimp and mussels! Absolutely fantastic, than we moved on to their salad bar which is filled with such bright and tasteful fruits and salads and cheeses. Don't stuff yourself up on the salad now! Always remember why you're there and it's for the main course , the best of all is their steaks. Cut after cut was just pure perfection. The right temperature the right seasoning just perfection. We couldn't figure out why the meats were just so full of flavor as our server Min let us know that the meats are actually cooked from charcoal. Unlike almost every steakhouse now they cook their meats under propane gas, Fogo De Chao does NOT. No wonder why the meats are tender and juicy the way they are served table side and just right off the grill. You can taste the smoke in the meats! All the meat carvers were all great with such big smiles on their faces and always were so accommodating with  getting three different temperatures of meat to our table with no hassle at all. Thumbs up to our server he always made sure we got exactly what we wanted and never had to wait for anything. I love how everyone here does NOT treat you like they have to do what you want or ask for. Phenomenal service from when you first sit down until you walk out their doors. Worth the visit and highly recommended! Will be telling everyone about our wonderful night there.",

    "text": "This place is a joke. We made a reservation for 7 and when we arrived we do get seated right away. We were seated near the entrance to the kitchen so we see the meat coming out. Waiter told us there were 66 different types of meat. We were excited to try them! night we tried about 6 different types of meat. We saw other types of meats leave the kitchen but never reached our table.    The side dishes were bland and gross. I gave this place a one star because at least the waiter was nice and helpful. After tax and tip. It was $70, what a waste of money.  And to make matters worse, I got food poisoning from this place. I was stuck in the bathroom all night!  Kevin C from Yelp decided to call me dumb and stupid because he states I heard wrong about the 66 types of meat, there were 7 of us! We all heard the same thing, I didnt believe the waiter and obviously there wasnt. Yes I'm stupid and dumb for eating at this place, another yelp fail & disappointment!",

Service was great, very personable and friendly. The manager came around to each table also which is nice as he checked in with how you were enjoying the experience and food.

    "text": "I'm not much for AYCE but Fogo de Chao gets my vote.  It's a Brazilian steakhouse so you can't really go wrong unless you happen to be a vegetarian.  First of all, we got an awesome deal through Yelp Spring Break.  $37 per person instead of the normal $48 per person.  Win!  The salad bar is just that, vegetables, salads, some amazing burrata mozzarella, shaved parmesan, and sides.  I usually try not to fill up on those things but the burrata was delicious.  I tried most of the meats.  I didn't try the chicken.  I loved the house special Picanha, filet mignon, lamb, ribeye and pork.  So much meat.  Give me more!    I loved the chimichurri sauce they brought out.  We wanted a bucketful, it was so good.  The cheesy rolls were to die for.  I do recommend you trying those cheesy rolls though.  I love that they bring all the meat to you and slice it onto your plate.  If you need them to stop just flip your card from green to red.  Super simple.  Need them to bring more meat, then flip it back to green.  The servers are really conscientious about the colors and will even bring by any special meats that you request.  Some are circulated more than others so all you have to do is ask.  I have to say it ranks as one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas without breaking the bank.",

The Gauchos that work here are really Brazilians from Brazil that cook and serve you generous portions of the 15 types of meat here. a bunch of us decided to take advantage of the Yelp Spring Break offer and dine in for $37.  There are many great items available at their salad bar, but you want to be very careful and not fill up on these items, because the meats and sides are where its at. my favorite meats were the Bone-in Lamb Chop and the Pichana. The sides(Potatoes, Polenta, and Plantains) were a perfect compliment to the well seasoned meats, and the Cheese Bread? Totally addicting!  The color cards....you're gonna have to play \"Red Light, Green Light\" with these Gauchos because if you just leave it green side up, they will bombard you with their meat rods like teeny-bopper girls trying to get Justin Bieber's autograph!

    "text": "Las Vegas' Fogo de Chao is indeed as good as it gets. While living in Brazil, I ate at a lot of Brazilian Steakhouses. I definitely know what a True authentic brazilian steak should taste like. Fogo de Chao hits the nail right on the head! Every bite of their vast variety of all-you-can-eat meat was heavenly and took me right back to my days in Brazil. If you aren't satisfied with your meal here, you have no appreciation for a True Brazilian steak.  They have a wide variety of steaks, ranging from their famous picanha to chicken wrapped in bacon and everything in between. The one thing I was looking for that they didn't have was coracao de galinha, but they can't have EVERYTHING. They also have a salad bar, where you can get your veggies, or try some authentic beans and rice topped with farinha - because that is the Brazilian way! In my opinion, however, skip the salad and head straight for the meat. You didn't pay $50 for lettuce!  For drinks, my wife and I ordered some Brazilian lemonade, and let me tell you, if you have never had Brazilian lemonade, skip the wine and give it a try! It's the best lemonade you'll ever have.  After my wife and I gorged ourselves on succulent steak, we ordered dessert. I was delighted with a papaya & vanilla ice cream whip served in a large martini glass. After eating all that steak I was stuffed, but when I took a bite of the whip I all of a sudden found a little extra room and finished the whole glass. My wife ordered the flan and loved it, but couldn't finish it. Flan is (and should be) very thick and heavy.   Overall, Fogo de Chao is the closest you will get to Brazil without actually traveling there. If I could give it a 6th star, I would.",

The waiter was super attentive and helpful. The salad bar was amazing. Everything was so fresh. My favorite was the shrimp and mango salad. Perfect sweetness. Now to the good stuff. Every single cut from the pork to the filet minon were juicy and perfectly cooked. As long add you have your green yes please the protein will keep coming! It was a really nice experience just pricey. Would go back again on another special occasion.",

I am only giving three stars because the market table was not even half as good as what I am used to at Texas de Brazil. The rice at Fogo literally taste like Uncle Ben's instant. No potatoes Au gratin, no lobster bisque, no marinated mushrooms. What the hell? Also, the ambiance was so boring I felt like I was sitting in Olive Garden. On a positive note, the staff was friendly and the meat was cooked nicely. I just felt like it lacked the fun, upbeat churrascaria experience with a disappointing salad bar.",

I super love the Pao de Queijo, I could eat it everyday! Buffalo mozzarella is another treat i love. They have an extensive salad bar. They have soup and rice. Please add lobster bisque. Out of all the meat they serve, sausage is my favorite(I know Im a weirdo but hey!). Cant get enough of it. Picanha and filet mignon comes second. I dont really ask for the chicken. I should try though. Not a fan of lamb.  Ive tried the papaya cream and its oh so yummy goodness. Creme brulee is classic. For the drinks I had the traditional caipirinha and bellini caipirinha. Send more please. I spent New year's eve dinner here with families, my birthday, my husband and I's (non wedding) anniversary here. Next stop is wedding anniversary and husband's birthday. Will I ever come back? Definitely!",

    "text": "This place has great, friendly service.  And yes, the free after-dinner (or before) chocolates at the hostess stand are delicious.   The Gauchos do not use Brazilian Portuguese terms for the meats... this was kind of disappointing since I was expecting that part of the fun learning experience.  Even if they have to explain what they said, that's part of the fun.  To skip this aspect seems... lazy.    Anyway, the Picanha is called \"house special.\"  The bacon-wrapped filet mignon is CLEARLY the best choice; DO NOT waste time or stomach space on chicken. The sausage was ok, definitely not the tastiest part of the meal, nor the best I've ever had.  It wasn't even second or third best.  I'm not a fan of lamb, so I skipped that choice. The porterhouse was pretty good, but I suggest you ask for medium rare or medium since the well done cut is kind of a waste (and it wasn't very good).    Why waste room on the salad bar?  However, if you do, you'll find it has great options: asparagus, sun dried tomato, green olives, chilled grilled zucchini, spinach, lettuce, greens, tabouleh, etc.  They offer a free cheese bread; IT'S A TRAP!  Yes, it's REALLY good.  But that's how they sucker you into eating that crap instead of the EXPENSIVE MEATS!  The lemonade is more like limeade; it's very tangy, and I needed to add sugar.  The creme brulee was very good, large even for two people.  It's a nice way to top off your meal if you still have stomach space and failed to eat enough meat.   Do yourself a favor and be sure to make a reservation.  Immediately after I was seated, I saw a tour bus full of Japanese tourists come in with their group and I was really thankful I had made a reservation.",

    "text": "After three days of lolling around being indolent I decided it was high time to get down to business and eat as many animals as humanly possible. Fogo recognized this basic gluttonous urge and, luckily, provided a veritable farm for me to eat.   Right off the bat I decided to prime my tummy with a caipirinha, which was strong and delicious and the perfect prelude to the meat storm about to go down. I mostly passed on the salad bar - I did have some marinated veggies and a little tabbouleh, so I could feel like I was at least getting a tiny bit of plant matter in - but the cheeses and cold cuts and salads all looked pretty yummy. When the pao de queijo came I hoovered those suckers like Pac-Man hoovers dots. And then I leveled up to the meats. Ohhhhh, the meats. All kinds of beef, pork, lamb, chicken - the best were the picanha (house cut) and the lombo (parmesan encrusted pork loin) but all were delicious. And kept coming. And coming. And coming. And coming. Until my belly was looking at least eight months pregnant and panting, exhausted, I could eat no more.   Is it gross to eat that much meat? I mean, objectively, yes. For sure. It's a wild excess and I probably shouldn't feel good about it. But the friendly gaucho servers, bus boys, hostess just made it a wonderful dinner that I felt great about. Except for the teensiest bit of trepidation while pondering how such profligacy would play out in my digestive system. Worth it!",

I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so I had little expectations. The only thing I did not like about this place was house easily they refill your food. The servers took a half-filled plate of mashed potatoes and replaced it with a new one. Seemed pretty wasteful. Same thing goes for the salad bar where they rotate or rather refresh the items every few minutes.  Yelp has made me very open-minded when it comes to food so I was able to try pretty much any of the meats they brought to the table. The house special was what hit the spot for me, as well as the lamb.   Even without the Yelp deal, I would willingly pay for this place. Which almost happened by the way, as the manager looked at my Yelp Spring Break guide with much confusion. He borrowed it for a bit and I guess educated his staff about it and everything went without a hitch!",

We popped into Fogo de Chao on our last day in Vegas -- making use of a killer Yelp deal we got through it's spring break promotions. $37 gave us the pleasure of having friendly men with meat on spits come by to our table and offer us delicious offering after delicious offering until our bellies split.  The house special and the parmesan pork were my favorite carnivorous offerings -- although everything I sampled was delicious and perfectly cooked. I was extremely happy with 2 different lamb offerings, and pleased that I could request more of particular cuts that I liked.  I also was severely tempted to dump a basket of the pao de queijo (cheesy popover things) into my purse. Warm, semi squishy inside -- that cheesy bread was extremely good and very very hard to put down. The polenta cakes, garlic mashed potatoes and the carmelized fried bananas were also super amazing. A meal could be made out of just the side dishes offered here! I did make a quick 'round the buffet -- nabbing only a couple nibbles of cheese and broccoli. Cuz I mean, come on! You ~are~ here for the meat.    Service was impeccable. We were promptly seated, water was immediately on the table, plates cleared when they looked a little worse for the wear, and every person --from the waiter, the cocktail lady, and the guachos were incredibly professional and friendly.    Fogo was the best and all around wonderful last meal for my Vegas vacation.",

    "text": "Been to so many Brazilian Steakhouses and this one has to be one of the top on my list..  Came here for lunch with a group of friends.  I made reservations in advance (open table!).  Moment we sat down, server introduced and took our drink order.  We were asked if we had been here before.  We were shown the salad bar.  I love how each person would have their own little \"More/Stop\" meat service tab.  Most places would have just one tab for the table.  Very efficient.  Lets start with the salad bar, big selection.  Things that stood out to me was the cheese and salami treats.  I get suckered into that.    We came as soon as they opened so I believe that most of the meat was still cooking, but once we came back from the salad bar.. It's on!  Endless meat and quite a selection.  I found their signature (picanha) was amazing; moist and tender packed with flavor.  Most Brazilian Steakhouses carry the same common meats, but Fogo had a parmesan pork loin (lamb).  I was in for a treat!  Sadly, I could not eat a lot.  The table also had additional side item such as caramelized banana and polenta.  It was across the table from me and I could not reach it.  We each got a dessert.  I went for the turtle cheesecake.  Suck when it comes to cheesecake.  I felt that I picked a solid choice.  When it arrived, lots of caramel.  Smothered it in, and as a nice display, a little orchid next to it.  Amazing! after my first bite.  The service of course was superb!  Most of the meat are well marinated and packed full of flavor of course made me thirsty.  I went through plenty of water, luckily our server was on top and made it endless for me.  I am amazed that they were able to provide such service even when the place was getting a lunch rush.  Lots of places fall short when it comes to the front house, but they got it down here!  The atmosphere here is a little dim, more of the \"special occasion\" type.  Not too loud.  Square and round tables available.  Nice little display on the way in (Rack of meat on a fire pit).    Def will come back.  I just have to build up a better appitite for next time.",

Lunch hours are held from 11:30 am- 2:00 pm.  Made reservations online and was at the door when they opened!  Salad Bar (5/5) So many fresh and tasty options! Their caesar salad was fantastic! Also enjoyed the fresh pineapple, salami, peppered and smoked bacon, and asparagus! Countless options available at their salad bar!  Sides (5/5) Cheese bread balls are like crack! Seriously. Very habit forming and addicting! Mashed potatoes were savory as well!   Also enjoyed the fried bananas to cleanse the palette!  Meats (5/5) Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Enjoyed so many savory, tasty meats! Lamb chops, fillet mignon, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, sausage, and bacon wrapped filet mignon just to name a few! The filet mignon was my favorite, with the flank steak a close second!  What stood out to us was how flavorful the meats tasted. At the only other Brazilian Steakhouse I have been to recently (*Texas*cough*Texas*), their meats tasted too salty. So much so that it really took away from the whole thing. Not here at Fogo! Meats were delicious and full of flavor! Cooked and seasoned superbly!  Service (5/5) Seriously, some incredibly attentive and friendly service! Wildly impressed by how we were treated by everyone, from the first person we saw and spoke to all the way to the very last person we saw and spoke to! All were friendly, personable, and accommodating!  This was such a fantastic experience that we have plans to bring some of our friends here to share this great place with!  Can't wait to come back!  5 stars.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!",

I'm a server myself and I've been to several \"nicer\" restaurants but this is by far, my favorite place!! Well first, the food was really good and personally, I'd recommend the garlic steak the most and I loved the bacon from the salad bar thing.   Okay, in terms of service, every single person who came to our table was so friendly and completely catered to us. For example, a guy came up offering steak but didn't have medium well and later came back and REMEMBERED us and gave us the medium well steak we originally wanted. Our server also remembered everything we asked for and ensured that we got the steaks we asked for. The manager Kappa gave us brand new plates (since our current ones were dirty) and even though we said \"oh it's okay we're almost done anyway\" he said \"no you are my guests and deserve the best\" then gave us brand new plates and a whole refill on our plates.  Our server, Luis was extremely friendly and the hostess was also very prompt and helpful. Overall, everyone was very attentive and GREAT! Thanks for a great dinner and first dinner in Vegas",

    "text": "Hold on to your hats folks, this is gonna be a good one. Before I begin I have to say our server and all of the food servers were very nice!   So my boyfriend and I LOVE Texas de Brazil, but I had been to a Fogo de Chao in LA, and the ambiance was just more formal. Considering we were celebrating our 3 year anniversary, we decided to give it a try. We dress up super nice, and must say we were probably the nicest dressed of everyone there.  What a horrible mistake to come here... First when we get there my boyfriend goes straight for the salad bar as always, he comes back with minimal food on his plate which is unusual because let's be honest he's 6'3 and a big guy. Well, he tells me there were flies over some of the food... gross. So he ended up not even eating the salad bar, and I didn't either nor even make a plate. We had to ask for sides, they were never brought and then some were brought out cold.  Later the meat shows up at our table 1 by 1 and at first it's going great everything is tasting good. But then we get some type of garlic steak? Well I bit into it and what do you know a nice piece of fat and straight garlic seasoning in my mouth. Like I am talking course garlic powdery rub. It was horrible, and then ruined my palette because all I could taste was garlic for the next few hours. We received cold mashed potatoes. Finally I ask to speak to a manager. I work in a restaurant so I get that things go wrong, but it's our anniversary and just one thing after the other. The manager apologizes and we think everything is good. He says he will take care of the steak but will still charge up for the salad bar.... (which we didn't eat mind you). And to be honest it wasn't even about the money, we just wanted to leave.  ANYWAYS. He tries to bring out new meat and sides. Potatoes come out watery and cold this time again, and he brings the Parmesan pork. My boyfriend takes it, and he asks me 3 times even though I say no if I want some as well (I don't eat very much pork). He keeps insisting by saying that he made it special for us and we should eat it. I finally say yes because he won't stop bugging me about it. I immediately decide that we aren't eating it because it was so sketchy, he made it seem like he may have done something to the food. We then had multiple people ask if we wanted dessert and politely declined saying we were full (we weren't just wanted to escape this place), and they brought out a cheesecake anyways and are you ready for it... the manager again says \"I made this special just for you. And the best part? The cake said happy birthday on it!! We don't eat the cake (even though they were watching to see if we did, which made me even more scared that it had been tainted). We receive the check and are still charged full price. He goes to fix it and then says \"this is the best I can do, take it as a half off coupon\"... and we left. Paid 62$, plus tip for our server (who was still amazing and felt horrible so of course we still tipped him well) for an ATROCIOUS NIGHT. I will never ever be back here again.  The manager had this creepy, devilish look to him like he was trying to get pay back for us complaining. Super uncomfortable. If I could give 0 stars I would.",

Only to be told the day of TG that our reservations were not in the system and that there were no room to make new reservations for the night. Angry and upset I wanted to still try making a reservation online, and it allowed me to do so...even though I was just told there were no more tables available for the night.   We still decided to go and service was horrible. We had to wait LONG periods of time for servers to come around with the different meats...our waiter only came to the table twice, and the food was not up to the par of any other Fogo De Chao. We were greatly disappointed. After all, maybe them cancelling our reservation was a sign!",

The garlic steak and lamb were quickly my favorites, but all the selections were good. The salad bar was amazing as well. It was filled with fresh fruit, salads, and everything to complement the evening meal.  You will not go away hungry!! They just keep coming with meat selections until you flip your card back over to say stop. Do yourself a flavor and check out Fogo Vegas, you'll love it!!",

All we wanted was a free Diet Coke and the manager literally said I won't do that.  On top of all that you could tell the meat was frozen.  No real taste. No salt and pepper.  It smelled and seemed old. The filet mignon Was driving didn't have that signature Brazilian smell or taste.  This was truly a bad dining experience. On top of that they bring you in for a 30 dollar restaurant week special. The ad just says all you can eat.  But when you get there they make you upgrade to get the better cuts of meat.  This place is just not good.",

Creme brulee and chocolate molton cake to die for. I can't rave enough about this place. Also the entire staff was super friendly from the hostess,  bartender and waiters who were super funny as well.  Wonderful staff. We were there about almost 3 hours talking and eating and talking and they were always friendly.  I recommend this place for any family event and business.",

    "text": "I had a bad time at your Las Vegas location a few days ago. I have been to two locations of Fogo de Chao. I visited the one in Troy, Michigan. It was a pleasant experience so I decided to go to the one in Las Vegas with my boyfriend and parents during our trip there. It was my birthday dinner, May 29th. I was looking forward to a wonderful dinner like the one I have in Troy. But this time, the servers' attitude was terrible. There were only three or four kinds of meat being served during the dinner. I can still remember they were a sirloin, a chicken, and a sausage.  We asked for filet mignon for three times but it was never there. When we asked for the lamb chop a server was so impatient that he even rolled his eyes and told us it was not ready yet. Our plates were full of bones but there was nobody changing it for us. We asked a server to change the plate and he said he was going to grab our server for us but he did not come back. The first time we got our plates changed was when we finished our dinner. One last thing, the people in the store were so eager to make us leave that they took all the plates away when I still wanted some fruits from the salad bar. I even did not get my free birthday dessert. Nobody told us that I should have a free birthday dessert. I asked if I would get promotions for my birthday and the server simply told me no. IT WAS THE WORSE BIRTHDAY DINNER I HAVE EVER HAD.",

We stopped in for my friend's 50th birthday and although she had a good time, I was underwhelmed for the hefty price of $174 for three people with no drinks except a few cokes. My advice to you if you read this review: take the other negative reviews to heart.  While the host and our server were nice, the meat servers were rude. The market bar/salad bar was quite good, but I was really disappointed by the meat - the main seasoning was salt and there was way too much of it.  To sum: bottom sirloin - or was it top? Anyway, this was the best meat by far...tender and flavorful  ribeye - too salty with a hefty salt crust, otherwise fine  lamb chops - pretty good, but I didn't like the spice mix used  filet wrapped in bacon - salt from the bacon overwhelmed any flavor  pork rib - horrible, the worst - gamey and possibly undercooked - I left it  I was bummed and a little hungry.  I was also miffed that they didn't offer us a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl -- lame!  Also, shortly after our meal, all of three of us had stomach issues and spent some time in the bathroom - my guess - the lamb? or the pork? Bleh. I would come back for the salad bar and skip the meat.",

I took my fiance so that could have a romantic dinner for two and was blown away by the warmth and courtesy of this place. Our experience started at the door when the two ladies welcome us and showed us to our seats in a timely manner. We were then introduced to our server Jose who immediately came over and ran down the menu items and house specials.  At this point we turned our service cards from red to green and began to take in some of the best meats I have ever had. My favorites were the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the flank steak. I recommend the both I also recommend the house brown sugar/black pepper bacon and beans and rice from the salad bar which were also big hits! We finished our night with the chocolate mouse cake and could not have been happier with the taste. It was delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet which we preferred. Upon leaving we met another Jose or \"Ariel\"as he is called who checked in with us and ensured that our night went smooth and offered to take care of anything else we needed. A great night! We will definitely be back! Thanks fellas! For making our night a special one!",

    "text": "This is an overdue update for a carnivore's dream.  Fogo de Chao - the last word of which is actually pronounced much like \"shone\" - is a Brazilian steakhouse. It can also described as a churrascaria, or a place that grills the meats, or rodizio, a service style where the meats are brought tableside for customers to select from. If that concept is new to you, just think about how amazing that is: they cook it for you, they bring it to your table, and they cut it for you.  If you're feeling meat-averse that day for some reason, you can stick to the Market Table option. There are lots of sliced meats, salads, veggies, fruits, and even soup for all-you-can-eat consumption there. You can easily make a delicious, filling meal out of those if you have to for some reason. Alternatively, if you're doing the Full Churrasco Experience, you can come here and carefully pick out items to compliment your meats as I do. I'll typically get roasted bell peppers, marinated onions, mushrooms, cheeses, the amazing sweet and peppery bacon, and maybe a bit of soup.  (At meal's end, I'll also grab some sliced oranges or other fruit rather than go for an a la carte dessert. The way I approach this, if I didn't get nauseatingly full on meat, I would feel as if I'd made a grievous mistake.)  As I implied earlier, the Full Churrasco Experience is where it's at. Just flip your tableside marker green-side up and they'll bring endless meats on giant skewers to your table. You can simply say yes, ask for larger portions, specify certain temperatures for red meats (although I'll stare at you oddly if you ask for anything over medium or even medium-rare), or even say no thanks / not right now. I've been declining chicken and pork options quite a bit - even the pork ribs - but they're available if I ever felt the need.  Why do I skip those white meats? Because the beef selection here is incredible. Sure, you can go to a decent steakhouse chain for a similar price, but why bother when you can get endless amounts of comparably delicious meats? The house special sirloin, aka picanha, is still my fave. The seasoning is intense and highlights and a tender, fatty cut. Garlic beef was actually my second favorite today despite the gray interior; it was still tender, and I loved the garlic marinade/butter. One more must-have is more of a \"secret\" and it's the beef rib. Try to request it if you can; it's brown through and through, but it's somehow still tender and juicy while providing a beefier flavor than anything else.  The ribeye, other sirloins, flank steak, and filet are also great, but I could go without them. The other beef options can suffice, and I also enjoy lamb. There was a delicious lamb steak today that was a lovely shade of pink in the middle. I recommend skipping the mint jelly if that ever enters your mind; it's way too sweet, toothpaste-like, and overpowering. Stick to the chimichurri sauce to kick up your meats a notch as your stomach fills, and also use complementary veggies.  My other all-you-can-eat trick is to wait until getting partially full to start on the sides, which are automatically brought to your table. The pao de queijo (cheese bread) is easily the best and maintains a soft, chewy texture in every bite, hot or lukewarm. The fried polenta is fine but could be a little more fluffy in the middle. I generally minimize my mashed potato consumption here; they're good, but not outstanding.  I've been slacking on this update, but after trying enough other beefy competitors including steakhouse chains and rival churrascarias, I can't help but find them lacking compared to Fogo de Chao. Sure, pricing has crept up a bit over the years (check their website for specifics), but you can subscribe to their email list for occasional discounts and stick to brunch - or even weekday lunch, if possible - for the same meats at a better price. And as delicious as their lemonade, caipirinhas, or other beverages may be, you probably can get away without them (or with them, if it's a special occasion).",

Shows on their Instagram page that they were doing a \"$39 dinner restaurant month\" promotion, so that's the only reason why we were there in the first place. Only after we finished eating that they told us \"oh you have to tell us ahead of time about the special.\" NO WHERE in the Instagram post did it say that we had to tell our server ahead of time and that certain cuts were excluded. Smh. Why not mention the special and give us options before we started eating? I didn't want to argue and hassle the server because she was actually nice, but that's just dirty.",

    "text": "I've been to a few Brazilian steak houses and this one by far has been my favorite in my hometown. It's located a little ways from the strip. A few restaurants within range but great location, easy to find. A fairly small parking lot but not really an issue.  The ambiance is soft and romantic. A beautiful salad bar with extra finger foods. All of which taste delicious! It is all included ( buffet style) is what I would call it.   You have what looks like a small drink coaster with red and green. When you are ready for those mouth watering meats passing by you constantly you quickly flip that card to green and they start rolling in!!   You can get your meat rare to well done!! There is usually 7 or more kinds of meat going around all with bursting flavors. Most of which is steak but you get surprised with lamb chops and sausage etc!!   It didn't seem like we had a set server, we did have an awesome carver who made us laugh. He made our night even better his name was junior very outgoing! We spent about an hour and a half dining, we almost needed piggy back rides out of there!  It was a bit pricey, but if you can eat you can easily get your monies worth! We do this every 3-6 months.",

    "text": "Yet another reason why you don't trust yelp for reviews when the restaurant is close to the strip.  Attempting to give another bbbq establishment a try my gf and I decided to go here. Our usual place is Texas de Brazil but we thought it fair to branch out for once.  This was definitely a mistake on our part.   We we seated at 6:15 on a Friday night, just the two of us. Ordered drinks and went to the buffet area to grab some sides.  Came back to our table and started eating and proceeded to wait.. and wait.. 15 mins after we sat down the first gaucho came around.  Then 5 mins later the second. 20 mins after be seated we had only seen two of them. At $55 a person this is unacceptable. There's 15 different proteins on the menu.   Three times different servers came around asking if we needed anything and each time I said yes, where's the gauchos?  Only after the third server came around did we get what we had actually requested.  All in all it took over 30 minutes just to get what we were after, and we never even got to see all of their offerings because of the lack of attentiveness by the gauchos.   In all my bbbq experiences this was by far the worst one I've ever had. The salad bar area was comical compared to other establishments I've been to, even ones with a cheaper price of entry.  The only \"highlight\" really was the beans and rice, something I can whip up at home with my eyes closed.  The mashed potatoes were watery, the chimichurri sauce (that you have to request from the server) was extremely under seasoned (no salt).  We we're comped for some of our meal which was appreciated. Oscar was attentive to the situation but honestly the situation shouldn't of happened in the first place.  At the end of the day this is a second rate establishment charging first rate prices. Perhaps they should reconsider some of their methods.",

On Father's Day food was great and the service was even better.   So my husband and I decided come back for our anniversary.   When we made our reservation the hostess said that we would get a a complimentary dessert for our special day.   Today  1-Service~ We had to keep looking around for someone to refill our drinks.  *Then they filled my drink and walked away from my husbands empty glass.   2-The server that was handling our dessert and bill was so over the top loud that other tables were looking at us when she was talking.   Just this experience alone was extremely embarrassing.  When we brought up the complimentary dessert she said   ( oh no you do not get a Free Dessert)   then she brought us the bill and tried charging us $41.00 a person when we only had the salad bar.  Then having to discuss the issues she is still being so fricking loud.   So I just got up. I was done at this point.  Lost any appetite for dessert and this lady was ruining my anniversary lunch. I just wanted to leave.  While walking up I went up to talk with someone about what was taking place and was cut off mid sentence.   I am talking about how loud and embarrassing the server is being and the manager is talking about a bill mix up.   Things happen I can understand a bill mix up, but a loud disrespectful server in an expensive restaurant should NOT be tolerated!   Was here twice this month spent so much money and I will never give them one more dime!",

We had reservations and upon arrival had to wait at least 15 minutes for the hostess to return to the reception area, with no apology only a smile.   It was a week night and there were many open tables yet we were seated next to the loudest group AND a screaming baby.  Fantastic.  The smoked salmon at Market Table looked tempting but there were brown spots on almost all of the pieces that were strategically hidden until you grabbed it and placed it on your plate.  Well played.  Some of the greens and roasted vegetables also looked foul and tasted old in spite of the uneven seasoning on some of the pieces.  The cheese rolls were big but also very cold and stale.  Not one time was the all famous Picanha served and we were only told it was coming soon.  The lamb chunks not chops were gamey and dry; and the sirloin was not medium rare as we asked but very raw and cold! So much for premium meat offerings!  I cannot believe we paid $250 for this! The server checked on us twice and never even returned.  Two other servers had to refill our drinks and give us the check!  This was more of a $25 dinner for 3!  We should have gone to Texas de Brazil instead but now know not to return to this location nor recommend it to friends and family. How unfortunate was this experience! =(",

The food I wasn't impressed. All the meats were incredibly salty. The salad bar doesn't validate what they charge for it.  The tables / carpet / decor in general all looks a bit dated. It needs a little freshening up. The most flavorful meat I had was the garlic beef but I never saw it come back around again. The chicken and sausages came around a lot probably because they want people to get full off the cheaper meats. Another possibility is no one was taking the chicken and sausage so they kept circling all the tables with those meats. Anyways, for the price we paid, I'd rather go to an a la carte steakhouse.",

The moment they walked us to our table and start sitting us down, the server start blabbing quick words regarding about their menus and what not. We really appreciate that the server was trying to do his job. However, keep in mind that not even half of us are seated yet. In the mist of all of us trying to settle down and find our seat. He start forcing us to make a decision of what we want to eat. We had no time to look at the menu or even had the time to order drinks. We had few questions that we wanted to ask before ordering because we wanted to know the difference between their regular menu and their restaurant week menu. The server was very pushy and rude in trying to up sell their regular menu. At the end he pretty much made the choice for us and did not allow us to get the restaurant week menu. Finally, after I can no longer tolerate how the server keeps on rushing us to make decisions. I expressed to him that he needs to give people a minute and that he need to stop rushing people. The whole experience here seem like we were getting rushed throughout the entire dinner.   The food here is below average compared to Texas de Brazil. The salad bar was not fresh and there was not a lot of options. The meat was very tough, hard to chewy, very dry and salty. Definitely not worth the price. We end up paying 70 dollars per person. Also forgot to mention that the server gave us no choice of selecting water options and we end up having to pay 80 dollars for water. This is the worst restaurant experience ever. This is a chain restaurant, really don't understand how the quality control of food and service is this bad.   Definitely will not come back and would not recommend this place to anyone.",

Within five minutes of sitting down I had many forms of dead animal on my plate. Beef, pork, chicken, and lamb of many cuts. All cuts were very flavorful and succulent. Although the chicken was a little dry but good flavor. The salad bar was also very good with a surprise addition. The salad bar has maple peppercorn bacon  This sweet salty slice of heaven was a great compliment to the seasoned meats. YOU HAVE TO TRY THE SALAD BAR BACON!!! The $60 per person price is worth it. They also have a 10% military discount. I will visit every time I come to Vegas.",

We arrived five minutes earlier and were told we would be seated shortly. So, we waited at the bar area and ordered a caipirinha.  At 8:30 pm the hostess took us to our table and apologized for them taking so long. When I arrived at the table the floor around it was disgusting. There were food leftovers all over the place. It was a mess! I didn't care because I was hungry. Our waiter was nice, he brought us waters, more caipirinhas and the sides for the steaks. I'm just disappointed to see a great restaurant like Fogo to look so disorganize and lowering the quality. The experience is just not the same anymore.  The Restaurant:  Last couple times I've been here I think the restaurant does not look clean. A lot of food leftovers over the floor. The restrooms are not well kept. They have sticky floors and toilet paper all over the place. The restaurant is big, it has some private rooms for special events and a bar area.   The Food: This is a Brazilian steak house, so they have the \"gaucho guys\" bringing steaks, chicken, lamb, and sausages.  The food continues to be good, but I feel it was better before. They are charcoaling too much to outside part of the steak and it tastes burned when you get an outside layer of meat. I don't know what's happening inside the kitchen that they can't keep up with the demand of \"Pao de Queijo\" (the most amazing cheese bread, typical from Brazil). Last couple times I have visited the restaurant they don't have enough bread! Two years ago, they would just bring you basket after basket.  In addition to the salad bar, rice, beans, soup. They have sides to accompany the steaks: \"Caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, and fried polenta\" They are all delicious, my favorite is the bananas OMG!! YUMMM...    The Service:   I think the best service at the restaurant is given by the Gauchos, they all work so hard and make sure you get the steak of your preference cooked how you like it. The hostess and waiters are just OK. He didn't really check how we were doing with sides, we were not offered more caipirinhas or water.  The Fogo from the good old times always got us caipirinha, after caipirinha. They also used to get us clean dishes after so many courses but not anymore. When will that Fogo be back?",

Liked that the place wasn't that busy for a weekday lunch, as much as Fogo may not like it.  Because of this, the wait staff & servers were that much friendlier and that much more attentive.  Being pampered is kinda fun!  The food at Fogo is still on point, coming out as light-speed and still hot & tasty:  *Picanha *Beef Ancho (rib eye) *Alcatra (top sirloin) *Fraldinha (bottom sirloin) *Costela (beef ribs) - LOVE them, rich & fatty & beefy *Cordeiro (lamb chops) *Linguica (pork sausage) *Frango (chicken) *Garlic Mashed Potatoes *Caramelized Bananas *Pao de Queijo (cheese bread) - don't forget these!  And please, get your veggies in!  That Market Table of Fogo's has so many great salads and seasonal recipes - you almost don't need the meat!  ALMOST!  Oh, always ask for a side of their chimichurri!  Delicious with your meats!  After stuffing ourselves to the gills, carnevore-style - our waitress found out it was my birthday, and handed me the dessert menu...then told me to pick a treat of my choice, ON the HOUSE!  I ended up choosing the:  *Tres Leches Cake - soaked in 3 types of milk then topped with vanilla mousse and salted caramel dulce de leite  TASTY-ville!  Cake was moist & creamy, but wasn't too sweet at all.  Perfect ending to my special lunch!  Good food, good company, good service - really, what more can you ask for??  Can't wait for the next visit!  #beefy",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse was the restaurant of choice for my friends birthday celebration and I thought it was absolutely amazing!   The location was awesome; the location was literally just off the strip, you don't have to worry bout driving because there is a spacious parking lot,  and they also offered valet! Yes ladies you can wear your favorite heels here and pull right up to the door!  Inside the ambiance was very romantic if you will allow me to explain. Dim lights, red hues, and round tables for more intimate conversation were abundant, but fear not, a level of intimacy was preserved. This would easily be on top of my list of restaurants for valentines or a special occasion.  To the real business; the food! The food was delicious. Everything was presented, seasoned, and cooked well! The temperatures, which is where we usually find an issue, we're actually spot on! This is hard to accomplish when the guests at your table enjoy temperatures ranging from rare to well!   My top two items remain the filet mignon, such tender little morsels, and the marinated mushrooms, a.k.a tangy buttons of love!",

Meat and potatoes go great together and this left me with more room for their addicting cheesy rolls!   The meat is so tender and flavorful here! This is why I prefer Fogo de Chao over their competitors. I tried their beef, lamb, sausage and even chicken. Typically at these places I will skip over the chicken but I would suggest trying their chicken ...it has a great flavor to it! I love that the meats were succulent and not tough or gamey tasting.   I also  think they have stellar customer service here. The wait staff always comes by to make sure you are doing okay. My husband asked for some well done beef and two people came out with it! It's wonderful thing because in some places it's a struggle to even get your water refilled!  The decor and presentation of Fogo de Chao is very welcoming . They even have the name of their restaurant engraved on their cutlery . When they pay this much attention to detail it tells me that they not only care about the quality of the food but also of the experience they are providing to their patrons.",

You can say yes or no to the options that come over. When you need a break, you turn your card to red. I tried flank steak (so tender and delicious), filet mignon (bacon wrapped was not as good as the plain. The filet was my favorite cut), house sirloin (this was my second favorite cut), ribeye, parmesan crusted pork tenderloin (I did not care for this. It was very salty and bland), bacon wrapped chicken breast (the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor), chicken thigh (this was really good), and pork ribs (ribs were tough and not very good). There was a great salad bar that had a variety of fruits, vegetables, and salads. The staff was friendly and offered suggestions. They moved quickly and were at your table several times to make sure you were well taken care of.",

    "text": "My friends and I took my boyfriend here for his 20th birthday. We had a table of 5 and none of us had ever been to Fogo or any other Churrascaria before. I booked a reservation here because it has the best reputation among them in town.  -Let me say I am employed at a high end steak house on the strip so my attention to atmosphere and detail is high, yet understanding.  Upon arrival the complimentary valet and door service is appreciated. The Hostess could have been a bit friendlier however. There were two of them and I feel like my group wasn't there top priority. Maybe because we are a younger group but still, you shouldn't not take us as seriously as other guests. After our whole group arrived we were brought to our table which was set for 6 although the reservation was for 5 and it was a tad awkward when asked if our other guest would arrive, but an easy enough fix.  Our server came over and she asked for our drink orders. I usually remember names but unfortunately I cannot remember hers. One in our group had to leave a bit earlier than the rest so she just ordered cocktails which was thankfully allowed. 3 of us ordered the Brasilian limeade which was very good and the free refills were appreciated. The cheese bread and chimichurri sauce was okay.   I had looked online at the website and here on Yelp to understand how service at a Churrascaria worked. We understood the gist of it, I don't think our server made it clear to us however. Could we ask for certain sides? And as meat goes... I really wanted certain cuts but it never came out when I asked our server. She didn't mention about there being a selection of shrimp and Chilean Sea Bass either! Which we really wanted to try after we were done eating.  In review photos I saw giant lamb shanks but when the men bringing them out... finally after a while of asking.. They were tiny small pieces. Not to say they weren't great tasting but we wanted more. I wish it was easier to have gotten exactly the meats we wanted throughout service. Because we didn't exactly get those specifics.  I do applaud the chefs however. Everything we had bites of from the market table to the ribeye and Especially the Lamb was absolutely delicious.  After we finished eating our plates were cleared. My group was curious to why their was not dessert included in the $51 price tag. Even something small like cookies would have sufficed.  The complimentary dessert brought out for my boyfriends birthday was much appreciated! It was a beautiful vanilla bean creme brulee and we all thought it was scrumptious. Plus it made him smile.  Overall the food was absolutely great but our first experience could have been a couple notches better. We'd really had liked to try the seafood and more lamb.  I had one more disappointed before we left. I noticed a complimentary drink mix that we had never even heard about from our server. On the way out a manager informed us of it. But I still didn't get to try it even though I asked..  That's all.",

We made a reservation and was seated within about 15 minutes of our reservation time.  Our server was very good and attentive.  However, the fruit and salad bar was mediocre (selection and freshness of fruits) and the steaks were overly salty.  I've had Brazilian steaks many times and at various restaurants but the quality of meat and the way they were cooked was not what I was expecting for a place that is highly advertised.    Plus, to get the house steak, we had to ask multiple times.  Surprisingly, the seafood bowl (a la carte) was quite good, but we didn't go there primarily for seafood.  The waiters and cheeseballs were great but you can get much better quality steaks elsewhere.",

I can give some latitude for the lack of attentive service due to the holiday rush but couple that with a very small selection of vegetables and meat it made the high price tag and the slow and sometimes non existent service not worth a return trip. The bread, potatoes and plantains that were brought to the table were cold. Customers were making return trips to the self serve station with their used plates, it was totally unhealthy and there was no one there to stop them or teach them. There seemed to be plenty of staff just not enough of them were working smartly. I gave two stars and not one because my previous visits were acceptable or I would not have  returned.",

For Father's Day lunch, I got a gift card to come back for another free meal...awesome!  If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse like this, it is essentially AYCE salad bar, cheeses, soups, etc....as well as unlimited steak, chicken, pork, and etc skewers served to you by the wait staff.  What separates Fogo from the other spots in town is the quick service, friendly staff, and meat quality.  Since it is AYCE, go ahead and try a bit of everything!  I start off with a single plate of goodies from the salad bar area, hit up some of the cheeses, soups, seafood options, and misc.  Then I head back to the table and start grabbing the good stuff as it passes by!  The most notable cuts to me are the Filet Mignon, Garlic Sirloin, House Sirloin, and Sausages.  I try the lamb cuts, chicken, and pork, but these are the powerhouses IMO!  Give em a go sometime...I guarantee you'll have an excellent time!  Pics :",

Two of us came for a late lunch, and it was $75 before tax & tip. Not bad for the quality of everything. Dinner is higher, but I'm not sure if there's more meat to choose from or not. The rib eye was my favorite. Ask to sit in Thompson's section. He was fantastic!",

We we're seated immediately.   Food at the buffet table was generous and lots of variety. The meats were cooked to perfection and really tasty. The staff was great - from the front area host to the servers and up to the managers. Christian was one of our waiters and he AMAZING.   He suggested this sauce to pair with the meat and he was spot on with that suggestion.  All in all, my boyfriend and I were delighted with the restaurant. And we will be going back!",

My favorites were the bottom sirloin and the filet mignon. Service was excellent. Never once had an empty glass on the table. Food runners were constantly bringing new, delicious food.

    "text": "It was my boyfriend's birthday and we usually frequent TDB, but this year he wanted to try something different. I made reservations for 4 on Fogo's website about a month in advance, but the day of we needed to make a change and they quickly accommodated us with no problems. We arrived promptly for our reservation at 7pm and were seated right away. After our server took our drink orders we started with the salad bar which consisted of different cold meats and cheeses, a few cold salads, 2 soups and a few hot sides. I didn't particularly care for many items on the salad bar, and it was on the smaller side. DO NOT fill up on the salad bar, this is what they want you to do. Save room for all the yummy meats.  When we were ready for meats, we flipped our cards to green and the meat extravaganza began. I had some really delicious cuts of meat including garlic steak, flank steak, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet and even beef ribs. I also tried parmesan chicken, chicken leg, sausage and pork chops. Everything I tried was very tasty. My favorites were the chicken leg, which had delicious crispy skin on the outside, and the flank steak. MMMM good. As if the meats and salad bar weren't enough food, they also bring 3 side items to your table; mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta fries. All carbs, again they are trying to fill you up. The polenta fries were bland and flavorless, skip these if you can, the mashed potatoes were good and the fried bananas were just okay.  I felt at times I was bombarded by the Gauchos (the men that bring the meat to your table) and at times there was no one to be found. We had a few different servers checking on us at any given time, one lady in particular while nice was SO ANNOYING. She kept coming by every 2 minutes to ask if we were done with the mashed potatoes, or if she could clear our plates that still had food on them! I understand that she has a job to do, but I felt like it was a bit much. Seriously, it was every 2 minutes. She wanted to clear our table SO BAD and I can't understand why. When I am done eating and I need my plate cleared, I will let you know, thanks.  When we were finally finished with our dinner, they brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle for my boyfriend. I was delighted to find that the dessert was complimentary, and thought that was super cool. This place is a bit more expensive than TDB, I found the salad bar to be lackluster, and because that lady was sooo annoying I don't see myself coming back here.",

So back to the rib eye.  I always loved their house top sirloin, the leg of lamb and the lamb chops, and the filet mignon, but I have a new favorite which is the ribeye.  Juicy, sizzling tender pieces.  So great.  Be sure to ask for their house chimichurri sauce.  Salad bar is definitely not the star, but I liked it.  You're here for the meat anyway people, cmon!",

    "text": "Hmm Texas de Brazil or Fogo? That was the question on my brain yesterday morning and I couldn't decide so like a fatty I went to Fogo for lunch and Texas for dinner. Fogo is good but between the two it is definitely a toss up. Fogo has the better decor,, service was 5 stars and very attentive, good wine selection, and for some reason I liked their thick forks....i know weird. But anyway, its all about the food and I think Fogo's salad bar is amazing and has way more vegetables than Texas and their asparagus stalks are huge. They also have a good selection of cheeses and cold cuts as well but I didn't notice any hot dishes (maybe because it was lunch). Texas on the other hand had more choices of hot side dishes which is nice but I would much rather have more of a selection of vegetables.    I do have to say I liked Texas meat better than Fogos. The bacon wrapped chicken at Texas is damn good but for some reason the chicken and some of the sirloins at Fogos were extremely dry. I didn't even want to finish the rest of my bacon wrapped chicken because it was that dry and I mean damn how are you gonna mess up something with bacon on it? (noticed i said \"didn't want to\" oh i still ate it tho ...but begrudgingly) But the rest of the meat: the lamb, the house meat Picanha and the bacon wrapped sirloin, da-yamn! Yeah I'll be back.",

I brought my 5 year old son and 10 year old daughter, which is a scary proposition, and they went bonkers for the food. They ate almost as much as me! Plus, Fogo De Chao reduces the price of their meals because they are young. Family Friendly is their second best quality next to their food. The owner checked in with my KIDS frequently and made sure they had a wonderful time. I am sure you know, a truly family friendly Brazilian steakhouse is RARE.  Now the food... OH MY GOODNESS! The buffet had a good selection and something for everybody. But, we are all there for the meet, right!? The meat was hot and kept coming. You even get to choose how red you want your meat. Every meat was juicy, tender, and full of flavor. None of it was overpowering or bland. I hate sausage. I LOVED their sausage. OH and the mashed potatoes and cheese bread. AMAZING! My kids NEVER eat much when they go out. They loved just about every meat selection and proudly told the owner this was the best food they have ever had. I can honestly say I have never enjoyed the food and atmosphere on the level I did here.",

    "text": "Eat here! If you are in Vegas and want an amazing meal, with wine and dessert for $200 or less, this is the place for you!!!! Now some might think $200 is outrageous, and it is pricy, but this included a $40 tip and a $50 bottle of wine (you really don't have inexpensive options for wine at this place) and it is worth every penny, and more! Our first option was going to be somewhere on the strip, whose owner is a Top Chef judge, but then we would have had at least doubled the price once you added in drinks and desert, so we trusted the yelpers of the world, and they did not disappoint. We made our reservations a couple weeks before we went online and requested a corner table, which we got. It was nice for privacy and people watching. Once we sat down we were greeted by our server immediately who was very knowledgable. Over the course of the meal we were also greeted and checked on by at least three other manager/servers (Derek, you are awesome!). This could easily constitute some of the best service I've received at a restaurant ever.   So the food......we'll start with the salad bar, whose name makes you cringe a little and think, \"why would I go to a nice dinner at a restaurant that has a salad bar?\" however, its name does not do it justice, it should be called an antipasto bar, or just \"bar of tasty treats\". it has several good cheeses, salamis, fresh asparagus, smoked salmon and cream cheese, breads, typical salad items (which I skipped entirely), marinated onions, sundried tomatoes, etc......everything was great! Then you get back to your table and turn your card over which starts the gauchos (the men with meat). This also tells your server to bring out the sides (yes more tasty treats!) Your sides consist of creamy mashed potatos, crispy polenta squares, and roasted plantains. All three of these were exactly what you aspire to make when cooking at home, just great.  Finally, you have your meat. There are 15 or 16 different types of meat that come around and you can ask for as much or as little as you want (I recommend starting with a small bit of everything and then getting more if you still have room (doubtful). I think around half are different cuts and seasoning of steak, all equally tasty. I preferred the house style sirloin and the filet. You will also see chicken, sausage, lamb, pork and ribs. Skip the chicken, the sausage was worth trying, but I wouldn't eat the whole thing, the ribs can definatley be skipped they were a bit dry. And then there is the lamb and pork, try a lot of both of these! The lamb was great and perfectly cooked, although the gauchos will ask you how you like any of these meats (minus chicken) cooked, and then they serve you from different spots of their meat based on your doneness preference. The lamb was tender and juicy, they offered mint jelly, but why do that? The pork was amazing, it is perfectly cooked to a juicy goodness and then coated in grated parmesean. I've never had this type of preparation before (usually you think crusted parm) but this was as good as it gets. One thing that really impressed my husband and I was how well seasoned all the meats were, I don't think you should ever have to add salt and pepper if it is cooked correctly, and you don't need to here. Finally, we ordered dessert (which I still wonder how we had room for) and went with the cheesecake with raspberry sauce. A perfect end to our meal. (they put a special note on the plate which I thought was a nice touch and showed our servers really seemed to care if we enjoyed our meal. see the pic I posted for the message) Overall, this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten from service to atmosphere and especially the food.  Eat here!!!!",

I wish I could have all of the servers line up in front of me and let me choose the meat right from the beginning. Because I feel like it's kind of hard to catch all of them. If you are a meat lover, you really can't go wrong with this place.  All of the meat are perfectly cook, maybe 1 out 10 is a little overcook, but mostly they do a pretty good job.   The seasoning, nothing fancy is just kosher salt and pepper. They believe, that's the best way to bring out the most flavor of a good piece of meat.  I disagree with some reviewer that say the meat are lightly seasoned. When I was there, some of the meats are too salty. I think it will be depends on the the chef that works that day.   Salad bar, I really wish I can have a soup from the salad bar. For me that's a big letdown. I love the lobster bisque at Texas de Brazil. I could have 3-4 cups of them. Fogo doesn't even have any soup. Because of that, I would have to take away one star.   Service and atmosphere are top notch.   Price is kind of high. But it's understandable, considering that the location is kind of close to the strip. Just be careful, if you get a couple drinks with a dessert. Your bill will easily goes to around $70 per person for lunch or over $100 per person for dinner. Most desserts are around $10 per plate which is a little bit higher than Texas de Brazil.  I still think the meat here are a pinch better than Texas. but not by much. Overall, I would still rather go to Texas de Brazil, just because they have a better salad bar.",

    "text": "I was thouroughly impressed by Fogo de Chao, their staff and the food.  I have always been a big fan of another, similar place (unnamed) place in town, so I knew what to expect in general.  It was very crowded, which is nice to see for a newer restaurant.  Granted, it was Saturday night, but it was still nice to see.  The restaurant is in a good location, not too far from the strip and easily accessible.  They offer complimentary valet, which is good, because I am not sure we would have found a parking spot otherwise.  The staff was amazing.  Everyone was very friendly.  I found it interesting when I learned that the entire restaurant is not open yet.  They are opening each section slowly so that they can ensure everyone is getting the best, most personalized service.  To the food:  I am definitely a carnivore, so this is like heaven for me.  Glad I saved my appetite, because there is TONS of food.  The salad bar is very authentic.  No sushi or soups to be found.  A great selection of salads, breads, cheese and charcuterie.  I had a small plate of salad, with some asparagus and cucumbers, but I didn't waste any time flipping my coaster from red to green.  Bring on the MEAT!  I tried a little bit of everything.  All of the meat was of very good quality, but my favorites were the house special (garlic sirloin), filet mignon and ribeye.  I couldn't tell you what their actual Brazillian names are.  :)  The meat was cooked perfectly - and the Gauchos are happy to accommodate special requests, like if you would prefer your meat more well done, they will get it for you.  The bacon wrapped chicken was very tender and juicy, as was the chicken leg and sausage.  I am not a fan of lamb chops, but had a couple of bites anyway.  It was OK, but that may be just because it is not my thing.  I was also not a fan of the top or bottom sirloin, but that is more because the filet and ribeye are so dang delicious and perfect, that the lesser cuts of meat got pushed aside! ;)Every meal is served with a side of fried polenta (interesting and different), garlic mashed potatoes (topped with chives and cheese, delicious) and fried plantains (to cleanse the palate between meats).  We also had dessert.  We shared creme brulee and key lime pie.  The creme brulee was nothing spectacular, but good.  The key lime pie was AWESOME!  Definitely some of the best I have ever had.  I found everything to be very good.  From the food, to the ambiance, to the service.  I think that the price ($46.50 for dinner and $26.50 for lunch) is reasonable, considering the service and the all-you-can-eat style.  That is cheaper than some strip hotel buffets in town, and at least you know that all of your food is prepared fresh.  They also have a great wine selection, and although you should dress business casual, it is not mandatory.",

The salad bar was fresh and had interesting selections. They didn't have bacon bits. They had strips of bacon. I thought that was cool. The asparagus was perfect.   Now about the meat!  Beef Ancho (Rib Eye) was the best. It was tender and flavorful. I literally cut it with my fork.   most of the cuts were prepared more than one way. We usually say \"no chicken!\" When we go to rodizios but the bacon wrapped chicken smelled so go; I had to try it.   Part of the experience is the smell. There is just something about the smell of open fire and roasting meat that appeals to me on an emotional level.   They also have an impressive wine selection and the wait staff was top notch.   (vegans... go away! you ruin everything!)",

    "text": "I have been to several other places like this but Fogo is the best.  my wife took me there for lunch and we started with the fresh and tasty salad bar. I'm a carnivore but the salad was just too good not to try. I wanted more but I decided to save my hunger for the real star....meat. As soon as i flipped over the card from red to green the food started flowing. The first bite let me know just how great the rest of the meal was going to be. All the beef was so flavorful. The lamb selection was great too. The chicken leg was moist and tasty.   Service was great. They kept the mashed potatoes coming, the cheese bread was yummy, the fried bananas were perfect.  Finished the meal with the creme brulee/flan. Even though we were too full eat more, there was enough room for dessert.  They do a great job here and the meats were all delicious",

The buffet has a moderate to good selection of cold dishes....including smoked salmon which was mostly ignored by the meat-atarian clientele.  Drinks are priced on the high side but many diners stayed with just water and/or non-alcoholic beverages.  Quality of meats very good- but that's what expected for the  $50 charge. My real concern was the speed of service and the quick paced ambiance- this would not be my choice for a long, relaxed evening out.",

The waiter was attentive and quick, our water glasses were always full and we always had fresh bread and sides.  The buffet portion of the meal was lovely, with lots of fresh salad ingredients, cheeses, and interesting items like asparagus and fresh mozzarella. The cheesey rolls they bring to your table are like crack for your tastebuds--you just can't stop eating them.   Then of course, the main event: The Meat. Waiters come to your table offering whatever they have on their skewers and everything we tried was fabulous from filet mignon to New York strip to lamb and pork ribs. Every bite was heavenly and we ate until we couldn't move.  There's nothing truly unique or fancy, but if you like quality meat, in massive quantities, for one set price, with lots of side dishes, this place is for you!",

It's all you can eat great quality meat. It's fucken amazing. It's so much delicious amazing quality meat cooked anyway you like it. They serve these little bread rolls that I believe are made from the poop of angels. They are so delicious. The Picana is my fav meat and there papaya cream is great. Honestly they work so fast here and are always on top that I didn't have time to take a picture of the meat, but the manager saw that I checked in on yelp and gave us this surprise. So if you ever in Vegas and don't mind popping a baby cow after dinner. This is a must. It's kinda $$$ but well worth it. Maybe not a date night place unless your girl loves to eat meat. ( don't let her fill up tho, make sure she leaves room for your meat) #eatdrinkmomo",

The salad bar is okay, but I would advise conserving room in your stomach for the delicious cheese puffs, the crispy polenta, the sweet fried bananas, and the tender, succulent meat offerings. Who needs greens? Not. Me.  We ordered up some Caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail of choice at Fogo, whet our appetite with those light, airy cheese puffs, and then turned our coasters to green to let the parade of meat commence.   Everything was amazing, but my favorite was definitely the filet. I love my meat on the suuuuuuper rare side, and there were plenty of almost-mooing options to choose from. We definitely ate wayyyyyy too much, so exercise some self restraint, or be prepared to cancel whatever plans you had for later that evening.",

They have a salad bar, which I didn't experience as well as Brazilian-style sides. The star of the show is of course the meat, which flows continuously. They have steak, ribs, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken wings and etc. The meat is perfection - well seasoned, tender, juicy - just amazing!  I can't really speak about the service since I was in a private area, but the food it definitely worth trying.",

    "text": "Really good food. Salad bar is awesome and the bread is killer. Service was good (other than a major screw up by our waiter that I will explain below), and it was noisy but not overly so. Plus, we were sharing the dining room with the San Antonio Spurs (a perfect place to bring those big dudes!)  The meat was good, but not all cuts were equal in quality. My filet mignon was to die for, as was the lamb shank, but the sirloin was tough. That's really all I can comment of beef wise because it's all I tasted.   This leads me to my missing stars. I had gastric bypass 9 months ago, so I eat like a small child, sometimes less. We went to this restaurant because my husband wanted Brazilian BBQ for his bday, so I was aiming to please. I told the waiter about my restrictions and asked if there was a smaller portion option or another option all together. He informed me that they had unlimited sea bass as an option but that was it. That doesn't help me because \"unlimited\" will still be a waste of money when it comes to my stomach. Ok fine, I guess I'll just go with the beef. I was going to waste my money anyway. After we paid the bill, I said to my husband, \"I would come back if I could just do the salad bar. There is plenty of protein there and it satisfied me without needing the meat, and that way you could come for the meat and we would waste $51.50 on me.\" A nearby server overheard and said, \"Oh, you can do just salad bar, it's $28.99\" Really?! I asked for other options BEFORE the meal... I kinda feel like I was scammed out of my $22. Beef is hard to digest, so I literally ate 3 bites. They knew I had by always having my \"red coaster\" up while my husband was on \"green\" the whole time. So he knew I wasn't eating. The kind thing to do would have been to charge me a child's rate. The RIGHT thing to do would have been to answer me honestly when I asked for options since they weren't on the menu. Puts a really bitter taste in our mouths, and for that reason alone, we probably won't be back. All your waiter has to say was, \"Yes, there are options... We can't charge you for a child, but in addition to our sea bass, we have a salad bar only option.\" That's it. And for that you lost a customer. Kinda sad.   I realize that at a buffet there is only one option (which is why I only go to those when husband is in the mood, otherwise it doesn't make sense for me). But it is up front, and I know I'm throwing my money away by going. The difference here is that there apparently are options and when I nicely asked for the available options at Fogo, I wasn't given them until my bill was paid. That's bad business. :(",

    "text": "I visited here for a \"light\" lunch on Monday I was quite impressed here's the breakdown.  Parking:  Easy, there is a lot right in front of the restaurant .  Ambiance: Modern a tad dark.  Service: While the food was quite good it was the service that sold it for me. My waiter explained very clearly about the menu and how to order the meat (basically by flipping a chip on green when you were ready to be served or flipping the chip to red when you needed a break.) The waitstaff is amazing they kept all my drinks filled, my bread basket full, and my plates cleared without me having to flag someone down. They constantly checked on me and my party to make sure we had everything we needed.   Food:  This restaurant has a great salad bar everything I tried was fresh and well flavored. Now on to the meat I tried everything and almost ate myself into a meat coma it was just that good ! Some of my favorites: 1)Top Sirloin 2) Fillet Mignon          3) Bacon wrapped chicken leg 4) Lamb chops  5) The cheese bread  6)The Lemonade I think I drank 4 of these at least.  Number 4 came as a shock to me since I rarely eat lamb but again it was just that good!  Tips: Try to pace yourself it is so easy to eat with your eyes here. Trust me once you turn over that chip to green the meats comes out at a dizzying pace and your gonna want to try it all, so slow down and take it easy.  Try to go during lunch if you can the crowds and the waiting times tend to be less than if you went during dinner  Have them sit you in the first room near the salad bar so you can avoid the long walking trips to and from your table and since this room is closest to the kitchen you get first dibs at the meats.   I will definitely visit fogo de chao again!",

    "text": "Finally, I get a chance to try the legendary Fogo de Chao. As far as Brazilian Steakhouse's go, this place is the best I have ever tried, and it thus earns an easy 5 stars from me. We came for lunch to maximize our value, and we came HUNGRY. Let's get to the reviewing!  The salad bar has mostly what you'd expect at such a place. A good selection of green leafy vegetables is what I recommend because it's healthy and keeps you from filling up too much before the good stuff. The cold mushrooms and asparagus are both decent options. They have those spicy little red peppers that I enjoy, as well as a decent selection of cheeses.   The mashed potatoes side arrived shortly and wasn't extraordinary but decent. Once the meat began to arrive, it was pretty relentless. I loved the sirloin steak, medium or less. The Flank steak was surprisingly juicy and tasty as well. I love that they often offer multiple levels of cooked for the customers, and if you want something rare that they don't have, they will simply make some more for you promptly. You'll want to try the lamb steak but the lamb chop wasn't particularly impressive. I probably ate 3 orders of the signature fogo cut, which has just the right amount of pink throughout the cut. The garlic sirloin is also delectable, without being overly flavored. I went crazy for the rib eye just as I was reaching maximum fullness.  The service is very good here-- they seem to take their reputation seriously as the premier Brazillian BBQ in clark county and they treat you with respect and care. You won't find better in this town, and hence they get the 5 stars.",

    "text": "Came here twice and this place never let me down!   We made a reservation on Open table at 8pm on a Tuesday night and surprisingly it was overbooked so we had to wait at the bar for about 30min. My boyfriend and I didn't really like that because that's the whole point of a reservation. But it is during the convention week and I think it means the food must be good! We sat at the bar and had their special drink Caipirinha. It was amazing and there, I wouldn't mind waiting :)   Once we are seated, our server Sergio came right away to take our drink orders and explained how they \"fogo\" here. A little bit later, their manager Ricardo came and said hi. We are very happy at how friendly people here are. They have a salad bar in the center of the restaurant and it has pretty much everything, rice and beans, also lettuce, cucumber, tomato, mushrooms, celery,etc. you name it. As for the meat, my favorite is the lamb with mint jelly. All their other meats are amazing too! My boyfriend literally started to sweat from eating lol we are both on the edge of a meat coma after an hour here.   They have a card on the table and you are flip them to indicate if you want more. The Green one is more and the red means no thank you. They will keep coming if it is green. The first thing that surprise me is that most of the workers there are from Brazil, managers and cooks. Another thing is that each  \"meat server\" is not just a server, they are actually the executive chefs and in charge of their own meat station. That's why they can tell how cooked the meat are and which kind you want!   At the end of dinner, I am very positive I am pregnant with food baby! I think my boyfriend too he just wouldn't admit it lol We were so full that we couldn't even move! But wait, what's going on?! The manager brought us desert : their famous flan. It is amazing! The sweet thing is not just the flan but he actually had  \"xie xie\" written in chocolate on the plate for us! because I had mentioned I am from China when he came to the table the first time. My heart melted at that very moment. It is just not a business no more, not just a manager and customers relationship , but more personal and more like friends visiting each other now. I am truly impressed.   Will I come back again? ABSOLUTELY!",

Ive heard nothing but good things about fogo de chao, so ive been excited to try them out and compare. ive had to drop people off  numerous times there and it smells delicious. Where i work, there is also managers and other people who work there that come in and visit my work and they are always pleasant and always offering my co workers and i specials.  So why 1 star? Well the truth is I've never got to chance to eat there. Ive tried to make reservations 4 times, and I've also walked in once....each time being unsuccessful.   Now I understand this place is very popular and gets busy, but why do i get shafted? I make a reservation, show up early, wait, im looking around and the place is half empty. I ask the people up front, why am i waiting so long? She replies that there are other reservations and that we will have to wait a bit longer. After 30 minutes and still not have been seated, I left. Why should i be punished when others who are running late get treated better than me. Oh and by the way this has happened TWICE.   My other two reservations attempts were denied because they were \"too busy and many people had already made reservations before i called\".   And of course my one walk in was a disaster. I pull in because the parking lot looked very empty. I walk in sure enough more tables available than I've ever seen. I enquire about eating and was told the wait would be 3.5 hours. There was a private party there that evening. Ok i thought, but the lady told me the party started a little over an hour after I enquired and there were tables available in the section that was not blocked off. Whatever   Im sure this place is awesome, but I've thought about writing this place off for good. Ive only visited again because my girlfriend wanted to try again.  Is my business not worthy to them??",

The selection of meats were incredible and very juicy and tender. The service is excellent. As a matter of fact, one of the servers asked me if I was looking for a particular cut of meat. I was and he sent it right over.   Definitely returning and introducing this place to my husband, since he's a big fan of the \"other\" location. :) I guarantee he will enjoy this Brazillian Steakhouse for sure.",

The Salad Bar is has a lot of choices. I enjoyed my cocktail which is Passionate Caipirinha (although Pampas Brazil makes their Caipirinha in front of you which is entertaining). The servers are really nice and helpful. The meats tastes perfect. There was a big group the same night I went and I had to line up for the salad bar. It was still a great experience.",

There was always someone walking up to the table offering a piece of something delicious. The sides were a little disappointing and mostly cold. My husband and I were seated in between the buffet and a loud wedding party enjoying many cocktails, so I wasnt too surprised when they spilt water it splashed on to me. I was surprised however that the server gave no care or question to if I was wet. In fact she used my chair back to brace herself while she bent over to clean it up. It was like I wasnt even there. So 4 stars for the main dishes and the chocolate dessert!",

The service was good, the market table is always good, but the meat was subpar.  Most of the meat was not as it has been in the past.  As well as a dinner menu that never got to the better cuts of meat.  We were stuck with only the basics coming to our table.  The cuts that did come were also over charred compared to normal.  It was a complete disappointment.  Also still not happy they stopped the pineapple being grilled.",

Service here is five-star for sure, the servers are very attentive and professional. The interior is also gorgeous and very elaborately decorated. It's a very upscale, yet comfortable dining environment.  As for the food, the meat is delicious, perfectly seasoned and a lot of very tasty offerings. The salad bar is solid, but I think I prefer Texas de Brazil's salad bar.  Since a lot of the restaurant week dessert options were out, the manager was kind enough to let us have anything off of the regular dessert menu, so I opted for the creme brulee, which was excellent.   Overall, an excellent Brazilian steakhouse and a great place to come for a special occasion!",

They have a parking lot with a large majority of spots reserved for valet parking. it's just a few footsteps away from the entrance so not sure why so many valet spots are need but I parked in a lot next to this business. This was my only issue of the evening and the food made up for it. Everyone had the Full Churrasco experience which includes the endless meats and the market table. The market table had a variable of selections including: salads, fruits, cured meats and cheeses, roasted peppers, bacon, mushrooms. These were just a few of my choices but there were many more to choose from. You can definitely fill up on the market table but I had a taste of each to save room for the meat selection. Several different pieces of beef, chicken, parmesan crusted pork loin, lamb chops and leg of lamb  and of coarse the house special, the picanha. The picanha was by fare the best I tried, the best example of melt in your mouth meat it did not disappoint.  Service was excellent. Plenty of Gaucho's walking around slicing the meat at your table and staff walking by making sure the experience was what you would expect. They asked if we tried everything and went out of their way to find the meats we didn't see at the table. An excellent place to dine for locals and perfect place to take guests when visiting.",

Me and a buddy got there a lil early about 530pm which is a lil after opening so there were a few people therw but we had the run of the place.   Everyone and I mean everyone was amazing. From the hostess the minute we walked in, to the guys that kept bringing food to our table. Absolutely wonderful experience, we sat for about two hours and never turned anyone away.  The card that they give you green for keep the food coming and red for I need to catch my breath. Never was flipped to red.  Everything came out still sizzling from the kitchen even after an hour of us being there and the place got packed. The service never diminished in anyway. We worked our way through chicken wings, rack of lamb, lamb shoulder, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, rib eye, pork sausage, prime rib and so much more at a point we were in a food daze.   Finally we hit our limit. Got our bill which was amazingly cheap in comparison to other places in vegas for the amount and quality of food, and then we struggled to our feet and out the door.   Well worth the experience. The food was beyond delicious and you will wanna try everything twice.  Go and eat and dont forget too loosen your belt before you go in.   Enjoy.",

Simply put - I liked the quality of the meat but was disappointed of the selection. The night we visited, they offered 16 different kinds of meat, but we never saw all of them coming to our table. A lot of the meat was very salty too. The price ($55 per person) did not include any grilled pineapple (separate charge for dessert), nor did it include any seafood option (a cup of shrimp cocktail was $21). The salad bar was small compared to every other places I've been.   The experience was not bad but also not amazing. I would probably only go back for lunch or if there is some promotion.",

I could go into detail about the downgraded prosciutto and salad bar items, but I will focus on the MEAT. For starters, we were bombarded with all the cheap cuts: pork sausage, pork chop, chicken leg, etc... but never once saw any lamb or filet mignon! Upon request, 5 burnt lambs (asked for medium) chops were brought to our table. I am talking charred black here. Moreover, all of the meats were so heavily salted I drank over a gallon of water. I am suffering from a salt-induced headache as I write this review. My glass remained empty long enough for me to finish my wife's while I waited for a refill. The cherry on top...? No more mint sauce!  A key complement to any cut or meat.  It allows for a contrast to the salty cuts, which in turn allows you to eat more.  This small detail is not lost on me. I believe it is in an effort to reduce costs as well as consumption. Funny thing... the trademark cheese-breads were double the size (in an effort to fill you with and save meat). The hits keep on coming!",

To my surprise this visit today was so disappointing.   We made a reservation for dinner.   We are arrived right before our reservation.  We asked to be seated to a table that we were told by the hosts and the servant Joseph Minh that it was not open for services and they sat us right after at the main entry.   We mentioned to the server that we have an emailed for the dinner special for $39.00.   Then he was trying to explain that they were certain meats that we were not able to have.   Then we asked for a list and he indicated that they don't have a list of meats that we could not have in a very rude way like implying that we could not afford the meal.  We asked to speak with the manager on duty and he made the remark that he is an agresiva seller.  A never was assigned to us and she was amazing \"Michel\".   Since we made a complaint, then we were monitored through the time we were there.   They really made us extremely uncomfortable  When we were leaving, no one said thank you for coming or greeted us.",

    "text": "Not at all as good as their Beverly Hills location, I actually felt bad taking my husband here instead of our usual. I figured since we were in town for our anniversary it would be a guaranteed fabulous meal for him as we have always enjoyed their meat and buffet before. Service was great, no issues there, but the food was nowhere near as good. The buffet similar but the meat was nowhere near as tender or well seasoned. Considering how much you pay to eat here, it is one of the more exciting expensive buffet options and I don't feel as well worth it. Our meat was chewy and really missed the wonderful grill flavor we get at other locations. The location itself is also nowhere near as nice, especially the side rooms feel very much like an after thought. Not bad, but also unfortunately not worth returning.",

    "text": "Review of Restaurant Week Special - Las Vegas 2019     My husband and I were missing the Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse in Summerlin, and decided try out their Flamingo location closer to The Strip. Usually we reserve visits here for special occasions (think birthdays, anniversaries, parents visiting, and holidays). However, Restaurant Week was upon us this past June, and they were a offering up a special rate ($40 vs their standard $55.95) while donating a total of $4.00 per person to Las Vegas' Three Square Charity foodbank. We jumped on the opportunity, and secured our reservations.     We ordered:  The Chilean Sea Bass w/ Mango Salsa and Market Bar with (Not on Restaurant Week Menu - I paid standard pricing)  The Churrascaria with unlimited cuts of Meat and their Market Bar  My husband enjoyed 2 glasses of red wine, and I enjoyed my Iced Tea w/ lemon slices    Both of our meals included unlimited Pao De Queijo (delicious, little cheese bites made with tapioca), unlimited trips to their market bar, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried polenta (perfectly crunchy).     Bring your appetite, as the food is plentiful and delightful. The service was excellent, and the 'gauchos' visited our table every 5 minutes to offer their specific cut of meat on rotation. Our waitress was especially attentive, and our plates were refreshed along with our drinks throughout the evening.  Now, I am not a big 'red' meat eater and I ordered their Chilean Sea Bass with Mango Salsa, and it did not disappoint. Their Market Bar is endless, and if you have any dietary restrictions (i.e., vegetarian or pescatarian), there are plenty of plant based/gluten free items to choose from.",

It reminded me of crsipy beef jerky on the outside with soft tender and juicy medium cooked steak on the inside. As always the picanhia, ribeye, bacon wrapped filet, and (my top favorite choice) beef ribs were delicious. We we're waited on with excellent service and the salad bar was great as well. Definitely got my fill of tasty steaks.  Thanks for the amazing meal!!",

    "text": "Came here again for another Restaurant Week in 06/2019.   Lunch $30 per person or Dinner $40 per person.  If you go on the weekend, it'll be the \"brunch\" price, which is the dinner price.   Items NOT included on this restaurant week deal was beef ribs, ribeye, filet mignon, or lamb chops.   Market Table & Feijoada Bar - Fresh salads, exotic vegetable, Fogo feijoada (traditional black bean stew w/ sausage), seasonal soup, and more  Best item was the watermelon. It had bits of feta cheese or similar sprinkled throughout but the watermelon was cut into cubes and really sweet. Also liked the marinated mushrooms, asparagus.   Main Course  Picanha (Prime part of top sirloin) - seasoned w/ seasalt or garlic Alcatra (Top sirloin) - seasoned for tenderness and sliced thin Fraldinha (Botton sirloin) - flavorful steak with strong marbling Medalhoes com Bacon (Bacon-wrapped steak) - hardwood-smoked, honey-cured bacon Cordeiro (Lamb) - Prime lamb steak or tender leg of lamb Lombo (Pork) - Parmesan-encrusted pork loin filets Costela de Porco (Pork Ribs) - Slow-roasted for flavor and tenderness Linguica (Spicy pork sausage) - slow-roasted and savory Picanha de Porco (Pork Picanha) - Seasoned w/ seasalt Frango (Chicken) - Breast, bacon-wrapped breast or tender legs  Top favs for me this time was as always, the Picanha (the queen as Guga on YT calls it...), and the \"garlic steak\". Unsure what this is. It wasn't sliced. It was more like in cubes. It wasn't listed on the restaurant week thing but it was nice and flavorful.   Brazilian Side Dishes - Warm pao de queijo (cheese bread), crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas.   Cheese bread is the best. It has a chewy texture but soft and light.   Dessert - Chocolate mousse cake, tres leches, or new york cheesecake  I had gotten the Tres Leches but also took a bite from my friends mousse cake. Both are good but the chocolate mousse cake is definitely the \"heaviest\"  Good place to check out once in a while. Downside, for \"cheapest deal\", the lunch, can't eat as much. Oh well. We only come here once a year or every two years. So its ok. Lol Sad that i can't eat as much as my younger days in the lower 20s. Just means i have to enjoy each meal to its fullest in the lowest amount i can xD lolwut",

The gentlemen serving the choices of meats allowed for us as guests to enjoy each selection without feeling rushed.   Very knowledgeable on the selections they carry, as there were times when we enjoyed one but forgot the name, they were able to recall from a brief description.   Would definitely come back. The charm, manner and joy of the staff made the experience worth while.  Thanks Tony and staff! We will be back when visiting Vegas.",

I had to have mine well done for my daughter and I to share and they always came back and served us.  They have a full salad bar in the middle of the restaurant as well as a full bar as you walk in to the right side.  The meat selections were delicious! I loved every single cut and type!

Shoutout to Tony (from the bay) for being so professional and hosting our table. He did a great job. I liked all of the food options for the lunch menu as well as the meat selections. I thought everything I tried was delicious however the Caesar salad was drenched in too much dressing the salad was soggy and another one to mention was the bacon wrapped chicken ended up being very dry. Everything else was fine but that's my reasoning for the 4 stars. The lady who was in charge of the salad bar was really great and helpful when I had any questions. I went back for the yummy bread about 5mins after 2, and they had just switched things out I asked her about the bread and she said there were a few slices left and she went and grabbed me a plate with them. The creme brulee dessert was so delicious the texture and flavor was perfect I really recommend that.",

The servers would come often with the \"cheaper\" meats and rarely come with the \"higher\" quality meats which we upgraded for. There were instances where we had to request a certain cut because we were not being offered it.   The quality and seasoning of the meats were very poor. The meats either very undercooked or very well done. They were very dry and difficult to chew, even the \"higher\" quality meats. Everything was very over-seasoned and tasted the same.   The most ridiculous part was when we were asked what type of water we wanted. We told the server we just wanted regular water. But in the end we were charged 7.5 per bottle of water which accumulated to almost 70 dollars since we had such a big group.   Overall, we paid approx 74 dollars for dinner tax and tip. Definitely not worth the value and would not come back.",

Will be back for sure. Not one of the meats was over cooked. Everything was perfect.  I missed read the menu price and the manager didn't challenge me just said show him and he'd make it right. Guess what, my mistake. What a professional. Nice to see, hate to say most would just tell you you're wrong but he gave me the opportunity to show him and didn't  make me feel foolish for clearly my mistake. Bravo! You've earn my return business.",

Their customer service is very good.  However, the salad area was super congested with people and there was usually a few food plates that were empty without food. The meat was not that flavorful compared to Texas de Brazil. They also have beef ribs but we had to ask for them to bring it out. The meat also took a while to come to us, so our dining experience took longer than what we would have liked.  They have good drinks here as well. The drinks are super fruity and tastey. However, drinks like coke and other fountain drinks are over priced at $4 for a small bottle can.",

We weren't disappointed in the quality of the meat... and did we have lots of it!   The \"pieces de resistance\" was their Tomahawk.   Cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth was to die for repeatedly.  The nice part about their different cuts of meat was that each was seasoned so nothing else was needed including sauces.   We also went through 2 bottles of wine and six Macallan 12s before having a sleuth of desserts.  Oh what a nite with the meat sweats and booze!     Only issue we had is that they only open until 1030 pm on a Friday nite.",

    "text": "This isn't your average Fogo.  As someone who has dined at many Fogos across the country, as well as many other Brazilian Steakhouses (it's my favorite thing), this is easily the worst of the worst. I've been here several times, each spread out over a couple of years, and keep managing to forget how horrible it is and tricking myself into really wanting to come here. Maybe this review will help me help myself (and you).  The food is simply prepared in such a miserable way. You don't get that juicy, well seasoned meat that you expect from Fogo. It's dry, tough, and often tasteless. This is spread across many of the meats. Now, not every meat is inedible, but the ones that every steakhouse has and that come around the most (picanha, sirloin, and similar) are consistently bad even when cooked to medium rare or rare temperatures. In this instance, the pork ribs were also so dry you couldn't cut into them, the turkey/chicken wrapped in bacon was hard to bite into it was so dry, and we also struggled mightily with service (took over an hour to get bread). The lamb was reasonable, sausage fine, but it was mostly gross.  So after having a single bite of several meats that wound up being inedible, and with my little disk still on green hoping that something remotely decent would come out (this was now an hour into the meal and we had only seen 6 different meats), we were asked multiple times if we were done and had them try to take the plates/silverware. There's literally a little disk right there that you turn to red when you're done. It's not complicated.  Another miserable experience at this Fogo. I really hope I don't make the mistake of going back.",

Starting with what can only be described as \"bread balls\", these golf ball sized delicacies were a delicious bread course.  You then hit the salad bar and load up on a variety of items not seen on regular salad bars.  When you are ready, you flip a red coaster over to the green side, and miraculously a variety of skewer grilled meats will start visiting your table.  Take a whole steak or lamb or chicken piece, or just have a slice off of what they are offering.  Or not.  The meat kept coming and I kept accepting.  Succulent and tender, beautifully flavoured, cooked to perfection--you couldn't have an empty plate for more than 30 seconds before a highly attentive server would be there to load you up.  After about 20 visits, I was ready to pass on desert, nearly 2 wonderful hours later.  If I was in a hurry, I could have been out in 30 minutes, but why rush ecstasy?  Side dishes included a dish of creamy garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and a third item I forgot.  Make sure you order the drink made with cane liqueur, but pace yourself--they can sneak up on you!",

This was our first time here and it more than exceeded my expectations.  Thank goodness for Yelp, we got a great discount during the summer and got $23 knocked off our bill.  This is a not a cheap meal, but it was worth every penny, even at full price.    The salad bar with fresh cheeses, thinly sliced meats and more variety than I can ask for.  Get ready for a protein overload.  You want to savor every bite and some of the meats were salty, but that's why the vegetables at the self serve bar would go so well together.    I didn't take note of any of the meat names, because it was all coming too fast. The lamb, steak, and pork are served from different but excellent cuts of meat.  The spices allowed us to distinct one from another when we asked for more.  We savored our meal and didn't pig out too much.  My only complaint was they kept refilling and pushing those plantains on us even though we didn't eat the first plate.  I thought it was a waste of food, as trays and trays of them came out and they kept convincing us to take it.  Needless to say, we even skipped dessert and I wish we would have tried something sweet from the menu.",

It is an all you can eat steak / meat place, where the servers come around with various cuts of meats on large swords.  The meats range from filet mignon wrapped in bacon to chicken and cheese and everything in between.   You must try the Brazilian cheese breads.  They are chewy and very cheesy.  They also fried plantains - which makes a good side, the sweetness will cut through the saltiness and richness of the meats.  I wish they would also serve the fried cassava / yucca - which can be found all the competitors.   They also have a full salad bar, with an abundance of meats, cheeses, pastas, and veggies.  A must for me here - the smoked salmon.  Please note that dessert is not included the meal - that's if you even have room for it.",

The salad bar was half of the size of the competition's and to say the least - rather bland. The managers visited our table more than the servers. Appeared to be understaffed. Try the other one after visiting here and you may just agree with me.   At this price point you expect more and better than the others.

Other times, waiters would just skip our table entirely. Walking around and checking other tables, but walking past ours, even though green cards are up.

Everything was so good. The meats were tender and moist. I don't even think I tried everything because I was so stuffed. The polenta fries and cheese bread was a little salty but still good.

There are only two in Vegas worth attending...and Fogo de Chao is certainly one of them.  There are better steaks in town for the price, but nowhere near better all-you-can-eat.  In fact the discrepancy  between price, quality, and value favors the Elite Brazilian Steakhouses here.  There is a wonderful mathematical formula that proves this, but I didn't want to come off \"all Elitist\" on you...so trust me on this one!    I have a problem picking an outright favorite, but I love Fogo for there class, and attention to detail.  They do not have the largest salad bar...they do not even have the largest selection of meats, but they are the most consistent across the board for quality and execution.  Additionally, the service at Fogo is a step above the rest.  When in Rome, order some Roman drink...at Fogo go with a Caipirinha to start or finish your meal.   The other option...a bottle of Malbec!   Malbec has a good price-point in general, and Fogo has some great Malbecs...the result is a great bottle that drinks like a bottle 2x the price.",

Because of the size of my group, I reserved the private dining room, which I highly recommend for its convenience and privacy. It was ready when we arrived, and we had two waiters who stayed with our group the whole evening to attend to us (in addition to the gauchos serving our meats). Once the wine was flowing, we were generating quite a bit of noise, but the walls of the private room contained it well (or so the waiter assured me; I'll take his word for it). We did a round of speeches towards the end of the meal, and without being asked, our wait staff promptly closed the sliding doors dividing the private room from the main floor to let us have our moments. Oh, the food was good too.  Good for groups? Absofruitly.",

Everything else was simply OK.  The salad bar was clean and attractive, but personally, I just saw it as filler.  I came for meat!  Service was remarkably inconsistent.  Our first waiter was borderline worthless.  It was difficult to get his attention when our entire table had empty drinks.  Strangely (and fortunately), he disappeared mid-meal, to be replaced by a waitress who was absolutely top notch.  She was astonishingly quick to fulfill or every need.  Without her, this review would have been 3 stars.  In the end, it still felt a little overpriced, but hey, this is Vegas baby.",

My favorite was the lamb (bone in) and the cheese bread is to die for..its also gluten free as it is made with yucca flour and I'll pretend it was fat free;) At first I was taken back by how quickly the meat kept coming around to our table.

Make sure to ask your server if they can call you a cab back to the strip when you're done because it'll be impossible to find one down here otherwise.",

VERY VERY DECEIVING! So the shrimp was not up to par and most of the meats were average to say the best. The bar was ok, service was not anything special either.

Seasoning was great but who cares if the texture is not pleasant? As a Texas De Brazil fan, I'd been here once and never returned. Now I remember why. Glad it was at a discounted rate for veterans or I'd be even more irritated. All three of us unanimously agreed it did not rate compared to Texas De Brazil. I really wanted to like it too. Again, it's nowhere near as noisy and more relaxing. Oh well.",

Haha and this fried platain fries that were good too!   Their GARLIC SIRLOIN was my faaav!! Soo juicy and melt in your mouth garlicky goodness!   The waiters/waitresses were extremely nice and accomodating! The manager even got us a great picture with the people serving us meat!  I forgot to say, there are people walking around with different types of meat. They give you a coaster looking sign to flip over. Red for no meat and green for meat! They'll come to with alllll types of meat when your coaster is green!   Their desserts are good: The pineapple one is this round, thick pineapple slice with a candied, caramalized topping like creme brulee WITH ice cream! The chocolate molten is my favorite! WITH ICE CREAM! The brazilian flan was good too! Better than any other flan i have ever had.",

There is a Brazillian Place in Portland and unfortunately in many ways it is superior to Fogo.   I love the sides.  The polenta is delicious as well as the potatoes.  No hot sides at the portland place.   The salad bar is huge and full on unique salads.  It's easy to fill up on the fresh mozzarella.  Good charcuterie too.    The cheese rolls are incredible.  I'd be tempted to order a drink and just pig out on the rolls.  Gotta same some room for the meat though.   My favorites would have to be.  Garlic Sirloin Bacon Wrapped filet Sausage Ribs.   A lot of the meats were just average.  Some of them dried out fast like the chicken breast and the filet.  The first round of filet was really unimpressive, but the second round was perfect.  We never got the pork one though.   Portland Brazil serves shrimp and grilled pineapple.  I missed these options greatly.    I guess if you know nothing different then this place is fantastic, but this place gets a four for me on unrealized potential.",

The cuts tasted fine, but are definitely not as tasty as the yelp reviews imply.  The meat is also way too salty.  I'm surprised people aren't stroking out on the spot.  The service was subpar for the price range.  I get better service at my local Chinese joints in Rowland and that speaks volumes.  They tried to charge my 11 year old son full price without even asking his age first.  They asked me if I was done and I said 'almost,' and before I knew it the server already took my utensils.  You're telling me they couldn't even wait till we left to clear the table.  They took forever to clear the plates during dinner.  Small table for four and our plates were piled 3 plates deep at times.  This was our first and last visit to Fogo.",

Finally tried Fogo De Chao after hitting every other Brazilian Steakhouse in Las Vegas  PROS -It has probably the best quality of meat of the whole bunch, 5 stars.   -The best pao de queso, fresh and light (addicting cheese bread balls that they love you to fill up on, and I know it, yet I can't keep them away).  -Papaya dessert really hit the spot at the end, pureed papaya and cream. Excellent  CONS -The only thing lacking was the salad bar.  (No one comes to a place like this for the salad bar so I don't weigh this so heavy, but still it's nice to have something special on there.  Other places like Texas de Brazil and Via Brazil have an awesome lobster bisque to take a break from all the meat. Also Texas de Brazil has some excellent large cocktail shrimp and a little bit of nigiri sushi.  -I really love the cinnamon bananas which every steakhouse offers, but they bring them out to you at the start of the meal, unlike at the end...and by the time you want a bite of something sweet they are mushy and cold. Glad I had the papaya dessert.  - Be sure to ask for the chimmichuri sauce as it's not on the salad bar or anywhere to be found.    OVERALL Since the meat quality was the best I've seen, this place gets a solid 4 stars. I'll be returning patron...in restaurant week 2015.",

It's a very different dining experience since you don't really get a good menu.

If you love meat I can't recommend this place enough. My husband was in heaven here. Toward the end it was a little much for me and I think that when we return I would want to eat the salad with my meat because it would break it up a bit. We also enjoyed an amazing creme brulee that was probably one of the best I have ever had. The service was amazing very top quality and ever present whenever we needed anything.",

I would definitely return but with a bigger appetite.",

    "text": "There are a handful of Brazilian churrascaria restaurants in Las Vegas, and I have tried four of them to date.  After a recent meal at Fogo de Chao, the newest member of Las Vegas' Restaurant Row on E. Flamingo and the latest (possibly the greatest) Brazilian BBQ hot spot to open in Sin City, I am very happy to recommend to all meat lovers living and visiting Las Vegas to make an obligatory pit stop at Fogo de Chao during your stay.  And here are the list of reasons why:  1) The value is unbeatable!  At $44.50 for dinner ($22.50 salad bar only) or the amazing promotional value of just $26.50 during lunch ($19.50 for salad bar only) it will be the best steakhouse meal you can have, without being $7/side to death.  2) The servers are actually the cooks/chefs that prepared the cut of meat they are serving.  They are intimately knowledgeable about the food they serve you, and which part is your desired steak doneness, so you can fully enjoy your food.  3) The salad bar is huge and stocked with top of the line items (giant extra fancy Hearts of Palms, artichoke hearts, a whole wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano!), some you perhaps will not even recognized because it is not typically served on a self-served salad bar.  (The salad bar only option is perfect for those that are not too carnivorous).  Although I will say that the salad bar selections are not as extensive as some others in town, which can be viewed positively (more room for meat!) or negatively (dude, where's the fillers I am used to getting full on at XYZ churrascaria).   4) The wine selection is extensive, and smartly organized in their beautiful display case for speedy access and service.  5) The best chicken (secret is the overnight marinade in brandy, beer and other seasoning) before being rotisserie roasted over hickory fire to perfection.  And this is not even a \"chicken\" place.  6. New Zealand Lamb!  Served as whole roasted Leg of Lamb or Racks of Lamb.  7) All steaks served are Angus beef and wet aged, always fresh and never frozen!  8) Multiple private rooms available (all hooked up with A/V setup) for corporate and special occasions functions.  NO DEPOSITS required, charged per person, and is available on a first come first serve basis.  9) Will offer brunch on special holidays, such as Mother's Day.  10) Service is very attentive, drinks are frequently refilled.  Service for the meats can feel somewhat overwhelming at first, but you can always turn over the GO/STOP card until you want more.   Ambiance:  4.5/5  Very spacious and up scale. Private rooms are stylishly decorated.  Service:  4.5/5  Very friendly and attentive.  If you have any requests, just ask the staff.  Food:  4.5/5  Heaven for BBQ meat and steak lovers.  I can see a lot of lost business opportunities at other steakhouses in Las Vegas, once words spread about Fogo de Chao. Salad bar is respectable for a steakhouse, and everything is essentially top of the line and fresh, without the steakhouse a la carte price!  Price:  4/5  Dinner              5/5 Lunch  Parking:  4/5  There are self parking spots available, as well as complimentary valet parking.",

    "text": "Quick: Really sub standard service, meat variety and overall experience. Texas De Brazil finally confirmed as the winner.  Pros: Filet mignon is solid.   Cons: Caipirinha too sweet. Went a full 15 minutes without meat offered, during dinner rush. Same cut of beef offered 3 times in a row. Lots of poor performance, sours the tastes of the meal.  Fogo de Chao is renowned as a Brazilian steakhouse. I say nay! My expectation of a steakhouse like this is to see a server at least every few minutes when the green button is on and when a server does come by, at least to see the breadth of what the menu offers within a reasonable time.  The establishment is nice, easy to navigate and classy, if a bit smaller than Texas de Brazil. Everyone is courteous, friendly and when you speak with them, you feel taken care of... mostly. The issue lies in the execution really.  After we were seated, the 5 of us moved to the salad bar which, for unknown reasons, was entirely filled with people all the way around. Not one spot open to grab some side dishes and no one was moving. Everyone stood, seemingly in line, for a few select dishes. I don't know but after standing for 2 or 3 minutes, we decided to back load the salad bar for after \"rush hour\" and start with meat.  In the first 10 minutes, everything came fast and prompt. \"Sirloin sir?\" Yes indeed! Chicken, lamb, sirloin, pork, sirloin.... then came a 15 minute dead zone. We could not catch a server, or they had sliced off the last portion of beef to the parties before us. Meat offerings came sporadically few and far between for the rest of the night. It was strange.  Only after 40 minutes of noticing filet never came by, we made the request to our waiter. Filet began to flow, and it was tasty. But by then, the lull had set in and our stomachs felt full yet unfulfilled.  Essentially, Fogo de Chao might have had an off night. I'm sure they can be better than a 2 star but this night, this experience was a 2-star experience and it can never be anything else. We were looking forward to enjoying a complimentary experience to Texas de Brazil. We only hoped it would be the same quality but a different experience, but unfortunately it was only different by being a far inferior experience, fine steak or not.  Would I recommend it? I can't. Will you see it the way I did? Based on Yelp reviews, probably not and I know many that swear by Fogo de Chao. My Brazilian friend even said that the one in Beverly Hills is superb. But I won't recommend the Vegas one, or be returning. All I can say to them is, \"Ciao!\"",

It's spacious inside and although there were lots of people, we were seated in an area where we were far from other customers. The staff here is really exceptional. If you were in a meat eating contest you could win.   I got up to check out the salad bar and when I returned everyone at my table was getting their meat on! It felt like a race to the finish line. We had nonstop meat guys offering various types of meat to our table. I had to quickly put the red \"stop sign\" up so they won't offer me anymore. Help! I was drowning in meat starting to lose my hearing and entering a meat coma!  I enjoyed the bone in lamb, filet mignon, and ribeye the most.   The polenta sticks were to die for as well as the cheesy bread and plantains. The mashed potatoes were nothing to waste your time and tummy space on.   My only gripe was a few times I asked for medium and got well done. So maybe ask for rare and you will get medium.   We never once had to flag down any waiters because they were constantly filling waters, taking plates away, and very present.   Ask for the chimichurri sauce, homemade hot sauce, and homemade BBQ. It really compliments the meat well.   The dessert could be better. But I guess you don't go here for the dessert. My guava mixed with ice cream is what he called it, but I would say it's more of a guava pudding tasted very artificial. I did not eat it. My hubby got the turtle cheesecake and although it was good, it felt like a little bit like a supermarket cheesecake. I supposed I would think there might be choices such as Brazilian style flan instead of cheesecake.   Regardless the food was top notch as was the service.",

On the other side was a selection of salads like tabouleh which was tasty. They also had manchego cheese which is worth the calories. My fav meat by far was the filet. It's definitely upscale which is probably why they didn't have fountain drinks and instead just little cute bottles. Overall they have Really good quality beef with the perfect amount of fattyness and seasoning.",

I hate it when waiters at other restaurants check on you, but they don't seem to care whether you're mid-bite or mid-conversation. However at Fogo, our waiter quietly and patiently waited for us to end our conversation... we didn't even notice he was there!  I honestly cannot remember which meats were my favorite, but anytime they said \"House Special\" it was freakin bomb. After awhile, all the meat started to taste the same... I guess that's what happens when you eat like 10 different types of meat!  The salad bar wasn't that amazing, but I mean, you do come here for the meat. Not the salad ;)",

Pace yourselves. If you gorge, which is very easy to do, you'll find yourself slipping into a meat drunk food coma.  The place is beautiful and clean. Parking is not an issue at all.

    "text": "This is going to be a long story.  So I went to my 1st Brazilian churrascaria at the Fogo de Chao in Chicago back in 2009.  It was awesome.  Probably one of the greatest eating experiences I have ever had.  Since then I've ventured to many other churrascarias (read my Texas de Brazil review) and always compared them to my 1st time.  Well, what a delight when I was visiting Vegas and saw that a Fogo de Chao finally opened up a location here.  So I invited my friend Angela to eat here.  And she's never been to a churrascaria so I was pretty excited.  I book a reservations online for opening dinner time, 1700.  Was really easy and no issues with booking.  We actually got there early and sat at the bar.  We took a look at their special menu of caipirinhas and asked the bartender what his recommendations were.  He was pretty awesome because he actually told us not to order certain drinks because he thought they didn't mix well and recommended their premium caipirinha.  We decided to order one of these and the melon flavored one.  They both weren't bad but honestly I didn't think they were amazing.  If you've never had one, give it a shot.  Myself, I think I'll pass on it for the future.  We didn't sit long before they told us our table was ready.  We sat down and the 1st thing I noticed was how dimly lit the lights were.  Almost like a strip club, it was a little strange.  I like to clearly see the food I'm eating.  Well, the meat ensemble started in.  16 different meats served tonight.  Admittedly some of the meats is really salty and left me thirsting for water pretty bad afterwards but still pretty outstanding overall.  Some of the meats definitely better than others.    You also get served three sides on the table.  Garlic mashed potatoes, fried banana, and fried yucca I think.  They're pretty outstanding.  The yucca is super crunchy, the potatoes garlicky and the banana really sweet.  The only problem with the sides is that you're so focused on eating the meats, the sides tend to get cold and definitely just don't taste as good.  So this is really the start of the beginning for me.  I think I've finally hit the wall.  I'm 39 years old now and my body's really starting to fight me back.  What do I mean?  I ate a ton of food that night and a massive amount of meat.  I thought I was going to die from meat poisoning.  That meat really stuck hard in my mid-section (stomach?) and was crazy heavy the rest of the night.  I honestly just don't think I can do this anymore.  Just done with eating soooooooooooooo much meat.  Yep, I've over the hill.  Sigh.  So, what's the solution?  Why even mention all this?  Because if you're not a carnivore and get invited to come eat here, you can order just the salad bar for $20.  It's a great deal.  If I lived/worked close by, I would probably do this at least 1/month.  Maybe even for lunch.  The salad bar is awesome.  Something like 30+ selections on the bar.  Bar is like 20 feet long and different selections on both sides.  Really outstanding selections of food and all really good.  There was even a plate of just fried bacon!  Was salad topping.  Kinda crazy, I almost wanted to grab the entire plate it looked so good.  Finally for dessert we ordere the papaya cream and the flan.  The flan was outstanding.  Flan is usually too dense or too drippy and really hard to balance the two to make the perfect flan.  This was it.  Really just perfect.  Amazing.  The papaya cream?  Wow, it's almost like eating ice cream except it's not.  It's pretty awesome.  Definitely give it a try.  So finally at the end, for the two of us, about $150.  Oh, and they give military discounts!  So I paid less than that.  Though they actually messed up my discount.  It's suppose to be 10% off and my bill went from $152 to $147.  Oh well.    So if you still haven't tried a churrascaria yet and you live in Vegas, you've now two outstanding choices to choose from.  Here or Texas de Brazil.",

No one goes to a Brazilian steakhouse for salad though... Soon there were fantastic cuts of meat coming at us from all sides. It did not disappoint.  My friend, who had ordered a Maker's and Coke said it was good and strong.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Had to pump the brakes before we ate ourselves into assisted living.  A good experience.  My friend who had been there before had told me before we got there that they had very delicious mozzarella on the salad bar.  When we arrived, there was none.  After mentioning it to a manager, he was surprised it was not there, went to the back immediately, and returned with a full plate of mozzarella.  Great service!  SIde note:  A very obviously homeless guy that vaguely looked like a soot covered Tommy Chong managed to come in and seat himself at a random chair next to us. He must have ninja'd his way past the doorman and hostess.  A waiter and manager came over right away and calmly explained that he couldn't be there.  He left without incident.  They apologized to us profusely.  No harm, no foul.",

If u don't see a meat u want ask the waiter , they'll go n get it for u but does take a. Bit like 15 min . I would go for the experience not really the food because I can just go order a filet mignon at a restaurant and won't have to wait as long lol",

My parents can be very particular but our server Jose went above and beyond to make sure they had an enjoyable time. The food was great, salad bar and sides are yummy as well. I think it is all about the details though, for example Jose brought my parents peppers/chiles because they're from Mexico so they love spicy food! I also was given a piece of cake which was a nice touch. I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "So this is not the first place you would imagine a vegetarian enjoying but it was surprisingly better than expected. There's a large all-you-can-eat dinner bar that includes tons of salads, grilled vegetables, potatoes, rice and beans which is the essence of what the vegetarian menu is. The cost is $30 which is higher than I would pay but when out with others who enjoy the restaurant, your choices are limited. They also bring fried Yuka and grilled plantain to the table, both of which are good. The wine menu is reasonably priced. All in all, a 3/5 for the taste of the vegetarian only options. You will be full and satisfied if you go here with your meat-loving friends, but nothing is crave-worthy. The service is phenomenal 5/5. The waitstaff is very attentive and constantly looking to bring you anything you need. Be aware, the meat is brought quickly in rounds by the servers as shown in my picture. So while you have vegetarian options, you need to be comfortable with a large amount of grilled meat all around you. Overall not a bad place when you are appeasing someone else's meat cravings.",

    "text": "This is the best Brazilian steakhouse I've been to, bar none. The meat options were plentiful and delicious, and the service was great.  I came here with some friends on one of their recommendations as part of a trip to Vegas. He swore by it, and we were not disappointed. First, the salad bar: I could probably have been happy just eating from the salad bar. There are plenty of tasty options, both \"salad-like\" and meatier in nature. The charcuterie options are excellent, as are the pre-made salads. My one disappointment was the feijoada. This is normally one of the things I look forward to at a Brazilian restaurant, but I was not really impressed by the feijoada at Fogo. It was kind of bland and was really more a black bean stew than a feijoada. So that was the one black mark against Fogo.  Second, the meat--what we really came for. There were a ton of delicious options, and they were regularly offered, based on the little green/red cards we could individually place on the table (as opposed to the table-wide red/green card I've typically seen at Brazilian steakhouses). The chicken wrapped in bacon was the disappointment of the night. Other than that, everything was fantastic. The pork was perfectly cooked and tender. The ribeye was thick and juicy. Filet wrapped in bacon. Linguiza (which, when combined with some chimichurri on pao de queso, made for a lovely improvised choripan sandwich). Several other cuts that were also delicious and that aren't immediately coming to mind. My personal favorite was the flank steak. It was really well done, and with a little bit of chimichurri on top, just blew my mind. I had several pieces of it before leaving.  Needless to say, I was rather full when I left. It's a little pricey, but the service and quality of meat makes it worth it. Great experience!",

As there are many Fogo's dotted around the U.S. in different states the standard is always the same i've found and that standard is excellent! Everything from the steak to the chicken to the lamb is cooked to perfection. The filet mignon was to die for and even the cheaper cuts of steak are cooked and seasoned perfectly.   The salad bar has an amazing choice and wide selection, something there for everyone. The real gem of this restaurant is their service. The staff are always so attentive but without being intrusive. The staff here really know what good customer service is! They keep your drinks topped up, clear plates away promptly, open doors for you etc. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants of different prices around the world from UK to Paris to Sydney to LA and by far whenever I visit Fogo I always have the best service of any restaurant i've ever been to. This restaurant is a firm favourite of mine and I can't wait for my next trip to the U.S. so I can return. Keep up the good work Fogo!",

    "text": "If there was an option for a sixth star Fogo de Chao would receive it. They are five shining stars on every level. From food, to service, to ambiance they really take the cake in the \"eat all the meat you can\" category. Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to.   For starters, they have one of the most beautifully displayed salad bars I've ever seen. If I didn't know you could eat 17 pounds of finely grilled meats I would probably just eat the salad bar and call it a day. But because of the meats, that's just something I cannot commit to. Great salad, awesome toppers, dressings are very good. You even have the option of getting prosciutto, bacon, and fresh bread.  But you're reading this review not because you are a vegetarian, you're reading it because the carnivorous instincts have taken control of your palate. Well fear not my friend, you have made a wise choice in considering Fogo de Chao to be your last meal (you see, it may be your last meal because you quite possibly could keel over after the amount of food you are about to consume). They have somewhere around 14 different cuts of meat. There are options of pork, chicken, and lamb. The pork is exceptionally tender and juicy. My favorite cut of meat that they have is the Filet Mignon and the House Cut. Both are extremely tender and juicy, full of flavor, and cooked to whatever preference you have (anything but medium rare or rare is just a travesty in my opinion though). The side dishes you get for \"fillers\" are really good. My two favorites are the garlic mashed potatoes and the cheese bread/rolls you receive when you first sit down (save room, you may eat a bakers dozen).   Here's one tip though, take your time. You control your meat destiny with a little card that can be flipped green, meaning you want more meat, or red, meaning you are enjoying what you currently have. First time I went here I was on green-time the whole time and my plate was a meat extravaganza. I was overwhelmed with beef. The next time I smartened up and enjoyed my favorite cuts and took my time. A much more enjoyable experience for a seasoned Fogo veteran.  Meat! Meat! Meat!",

The best thing about the meal were the sirloin offerings and cheese bread. I wish I skipped the salad bar but I understand its purpose. I was a little annoyed at the servers who offered the meat, they tried to push the pork with cheese on my family even if some of us said no, they put it on your plate. I said I don't eat pork but he put the meat on my side plate anyway. Please have some respect for my preferences.   I also did not like how, despite soda being included in our meal package, they did not serve us any sodas instead attempted to get us to order off-package drinks and dishes. I had to ask for my coke and they did not give us a refill even if it was included.   Lastly we hung around talking and eating until 10:00. They closed at 9 but left us alone, we only realized they were closed when we walked out to a dark dining room. We had to find them just to settle the bill. But I guess it was nice that they let us hang out and catch up.",

I didn't eat any vegetables and primarily stuck to the meat and lots of caipirinhas. They were super strong but tasty.   The steaks were great, the lamb was amazing, and the chicken was meh. I stuck mainly to the beef and lamb.  Ask them for all the sauces they have, mixing it up with bbq, their chilli, and other stuff was great. I ended up with a mousse cake which was good as well.   There was a good selection of vegetables, and sides. I didn't have any but my friends did.",

So much food that you'll start to wonder where you'll even put it.   Food: They have different types of meat at an all-you-can eat price. Flip your card to \"green\" and servers will flock to your offering a variety of meats such as roast beef, filet mignion,  ribs, ribeye, etc. They give a pretty hefty portion so if you want to try them all, ask for small pieces. My favorite was the beef ribs. It was tender and fatty to the point that it was the only thing I wanted to consume. Delicious on it's own.   Service: Need I elaborate? They're incredibly friendly, and they'll come to you the moment they see your card is at \"green\". Make sure to flip it to \"red\" the moment you don't want any more food because these guys are trained to really cater to you.   Ambiance: A perfect place to go when you're going to celebrate. While they don't necessarily have a dress code, it's perfect to dress up especially if you're on a date.  The price is up there so make sure you're in the mood to capitalize the food! I want to say, skip the buffet and go straight to the meat. That's where the best part of the dining experience is.",

    "text": "Love Fogo de Chao and have dinner here whenever we come to California on business. We come here every 6 weeks.  Definitely the only place to go if you love meat. The restaurant's concept is a never ending selection of beef, chicken and pork served by waiters dressed in gaucho costumes.  The gauchos come to your table with giant swords of meats. There are some very modest sides brought to the table but their salad bar alone is sufficient for a very good meal.  Had I not been to Fogo many times in the past, and based on our visit last weekend,  I would have left a 1 star review.  I asked for the filet mignon 4 times and never got it. The picanha was so over salted we were unable to eat it. Actually, a lot of the food was way over salted and other than the chicken, which was offered so often that it became annoying, service was very poor. My guess, and I could be wrong, is that Fogo management is trying to save money by trying to fill their guest with the least expensive cuts of meats.  There were 4 in our party and we were all disappointed.",

    "text": "This was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience in Vegas. We went on my actual birthday and since I was a member of their loyalty club, we had a $25 discount. We elected to go on a Saturday afternoon so it was the dinner menu. The salad bar was transitioning to dinner so we caught delicious sliced papaya early and then prosciutto and cheeses later. We are eating paleo style, so it was a perfect restaurant choice, but we did not sample the lentil soup or bean dishes. There were standouts, such as the chicken salad, smoked cheese (not Paleo), beets, seasonal kale squash salad. I only sampled one Brazilian cheese bread, and it was good and warm but not as good as what I have eaten previously. That's okay, cause we were focusing on the meats. They first bring you the cheaper cuts of meat, but frankly, I loved the flank steak. It was very well seasoned. We had been given a tip to ask for the lamb chops and were they special! We also preferred their special cut of steak and towards the end asked for the beef ribs. We loved those! The staff was attentive and we never had a minute with an empty plate. The sides were mashed potatoes and fried bananas which we tasted but didn't indulge too heavily. Because it was my birthday, I picked a dessert and selected creme brulee. It was very good, but honestly, not as good as Oscar's downtown. Again, not actually paleo. Yes, one can stick to Paleo strictly, but there are temptations. I would like to return for a midweek salad bar only lunch next.",

    "text": "I  would to complain about our experience last March 23, 2019. I had my wedding reception with Fogo de chao,  Las Vegas branch hoping that my guest would be satisfied with the food instead all i heard from my guest are complain with the service. It was supposed to be continuous serving of different kind of meat while on green sign instead they only went inside the private room twice or three times and what worst when some of guest ask for a well done meat they didn't  even bother to come back. Is this good customer service? ???  Another thing your supposed to service different kinds of meat instead majority the food you are offering to my guest are sausages and chicken and less meat. Your Price is not cheap i paid 65 dollar per head plus tax but we didn't get our money worth because of poor service. I understand that last Saturday your restaurant  was jam packed but still this  doesn't give you an excuse not serve your guest well for the price I'm paying. You don't have proper coordination with chapel of the flowers. My cake was delivered to your restaurant earlier that day but you did not even put it inside the function and what worst i only notice when we are about to do the cutting of the cake. When i asked the waiter about my cake, he doesn't even know that i have one. Your waiter went out to check on it. he came back and told me that there is only 1 cake there with a name joanne and miles. I told him that's us. How come you don't even know the name of the couple that  will have a wedding reception at your place and to think i reserve it ahead of time. you should have prepared for it and lastly i reserve for 34 pax and at the middle of program your manager came and asking me to pay for the additonal guest because my contract with is only for 28 pax. i told him you must be mistaken i paid for 34 pax and that guest i have is only 32. We even show him the emailed that i got from chapel of the flowers that i paid for 34 pax then after several minutes your manager came back and ask me to sign a new contact with 34pax. I guest he realized that he made a mistake. i just don't want to ruin my wedding that why i signed it. I'm very disappointed on how you handle my wedding reception. The money i paid for is not worth from what we got.  you are supposed to make my wedding reception special but instead me and my guests got the worst experience from it. To think i was bragging to all my friends that you have good food. Your food is good but your service in Vegas super bad.",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  A somewhat-overpriced meat coma.  I am no stranger to Brazilian churrascaria/rodizio steakhouses, but this was my first visit to one here in Vegas. Accordingly, I walked in with the needle pointing-on-empty, looking forward to a serious chow-down.  Well, actually it was my second visit, if you count the time the week before, when I appeared about ten minutes before closing. That was on a Sunday night, when they close an hour earlier than weeknights. That visit led to a rather odd conversation with the attractive young woman at the podium greeting & seating:  \"Sorry, I didn't realize you were closing. I believe Yelp says you are open another hour yet.\"  \"Yes, we are getting ready to close.\" \"You should have the manager make sure it's corrected.\" \"Correct what?\" \"The closing time listed on Yelp.\" \"Oh. .... Yes, I'll do that.\" I turn to leave. \"Would you like me to seat you?\" \"But you just said you are closing.\" \"Oh yes, we are. They are going to start taking down the salad bar now.\"   Of course I was suppressing a serious urge to Wilhelm-scream: \"Then why the bleep would I want to be seated?\" But I just walked out instead.  They're not paying this attractive young woman greeter/seater enough. Because if they were, then they would be able to afford to hire someone more competent.  Alright, so the second visit, we get to the actual experience. This time, arriving more than an hour before closing, I was seated lightening-fast, without reservation, solo onto a four-top. Nice, no two-tops on the floor at all, that I see. Appreciated. The table was cleared of excess setting and the iced tea appeared swiftly.   Some Brazilian steakhouses have tiered-pricing, to match various tiers of meat accessible, or to add-on a lobster tail or salad-bar-only or whatever. This one does not, a singular price. But I had to ask about that ... since there's no menu. I would have appreciated a menu. I'd like to know the rotation of meats going-in as well as the price. But whatever.    I was actually a wee bit disappointed with the salad bar, as it was far less robust, as compared to my favorite joint back East. And that surprised me, from a management perspective. You want your guests to stuff their gills on curry-cole-slaw and such whatnot, rather than break-the-bank downing grilled lamb and filet. But whatever.  I usually hit the salad bar twice, then focus meat-wise on the best option or two. Couldn't do that here because (1) the aforementioned salad bar choices were limited and (2) I have no idea what the meat rotation will be. But whatever.  As the skewers started arriving, I just took a small sample of each, flying-blind, trying to find my way to the end-of-the-rodizio-rainbow. It took awhile. And most of those samplings had been roasted far too dry. The chicken was roasted to \"gag-u-dry.\" Also the names seemed designed to confuse. There was top sirloin and a roast sirloin, \"the house specialty.\" And, in the end, there were two types of filet mignon. But whatever.  Also, other venues have asked me at seating how I prefer my meats. (That would be medium-rare.) So the appropriate skewers could be directed my way. Here, that didn't occur until about six skewers in. So early on I got a lot of medium to well slicings. But whatever.  Eventually the second skewer of meat named filet mignon, medium-rare, landed. Ah, the end of the rainbow. This cut was perfection: juicy, tender, spot-on-pink, charcoaled-to-tasty. Now, however, I am full of these other dry, medium and well slicings. So even though I've scored the mother-lode, the belly-bloat & meat coma are kicking in, so I have to back-up. But whatever.  Just in case you were wondering about the price, with tea, tax & tip, I was $75 lighter as I waddled & wobbled out the door. I usually made out at my ATF back East at about $45 or so. Probably because diners there are mostly filling their tanks at the robust salad bar, keeping total costs down. But whatever.  Having now paid $75 dollars for my own tutoring as to how to navigate the slightly-murky waters of this venue, I could do much better next round, laser-focused upon the best of the salad bar, one-visit-only ... and then attack a skewer of filet #2. Even so, $75 for this salad bar and a nice helping of filet feels a bit too pricey, even for Vegas. I mean I can almost squeeze in-and-out of the Golden Steer at that price. But whatever.  So the next time I am cruising down Flamingo, I'll just slip a bit further down the street ... to Lawry's Prime Rib instead. It appears there I can snag a huge hunk of pink roasted meat, plus have them spin me up a salad table-side, old-school gourmet-room style ... for about two-thirds the price.",

I liked how it wasn't just constantly the same meats circulation but different ones approached me each time.

The service is really nothing to speak of. For the same price, you can experience the ridizio in a better atmosphere, with better food and service at Texas de Brazil.",

The salad bar is packed with a variety of ingredients, and if you wanted you could probably go there for a great meal just from the salad bar. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and also very professional. It's not just about them bringing you a variety of meats, if you want a certain type, you can request it, and however you want it cooked. Pricing is very reasonable, and my only recommendation is not to eat all day before you go here, you will definitely get your money's worth and more with the amount of food that goes around!",

My wife usually just gets the salad bar, which she calls the best she has ever had.  I like the salad bar too, but I try to go light on the salads so as to leave more room for the scrumptious steak, pork, lamb, and chicken.  We usually come for lunch, so that we have the several hours necessary to digest this feast.  (No need for dinner after lunch at Fogo.)",

    "text": "So there I was creeping through the town I made famous when I started to feel that familiar emptiness right underneath where my 8 minute abs would be, if I spent 8 minutes a day on them, but I digress.   I was on the east side of town conducting some quasi business errands that I am going to try and expense and write off my taxes for 2012 as I got thoroughly mugged by the fed and the great state of CA in 2011. I saw when I was driving by that there was a new sign that read Fogo de Chao where Bahama Breeze was the last time I was in the 702 sharing my love for Jesus and putting it down for the west side (the bestside).  Now I am not a wealthy man but through pinching my pennies, shrewd investments, and a 2 hour heater on the craps table the night before I was feeling like a million Argentine Pesos. So I decided to stroll in see what all the unnecessary punctuation in the name of the joint was all about.   I was only slightly put off by the fact that the valet seemed to have taken a smoke break or been called away on some urgent business because there was no one at the stand to toss the keys to the AMG to. I wasn't really in the mood to park my whip myself as I don't park so well when I am famished and let me tell you, I was hungry like a hostage. So I backed up the miracle whip and parked it where I could get out in a hurry should any shenanigans occur. I happen to know for a fact that 2pac got smoked just a block away and I am not trying to put my life in the hands of a degenerate, horse betting trauma surgeon at University Medical Center, nor do I want  Deadmou5 or some other DJ trying to put my lyrics over some hastily crafted beats in some ill fated attempt to cash in on the rush of people to local record shops and itunes to purchase my last album.   As I crept inside there was some goofy looking white kid at the host stand spewing some garbage about how they do there last seating for lunch at 2pm. I glanced at the Swiss timepiece on my wrist and realized that 1) this is one ill watch, and 2) it was 2:06pm. As began to reach in my waist to pistol -whip this kid he blurted out,\"let me check with the manager to see if we can still seat you\".  He returned abruptly and gladly seated us. I was thankful I didn't have to chin check this kid in front of my 2 associates, as well as relieved that my belly would soon be soothed with the arrival of some delicious South American charred animals.   The server came over and greeted us very quickly offered us the wine list and had some drinks flowing pretty quickly. I strolled over to the salad bar where I was delighted to find a mixture of traditional salad bar type accoutrements as well as several other pleasant surprises. I sat down to get busy with my salad as a body like this doesn't happen on its own. It takes prayers, training, vitamins, healthy food choices, a bunch of extreme cardio, and a naturally athletic build that has been referred to as \"the gift\".   All the salad was delicious and I polished it off faster than Whitney Houston goes through her Xanax prescription. I turned over the little poker chip they give you that shows the Gouchos (the guys delivering meat on swords) that I was ready to start putting in work.   After about 6 guys showed up and sliced off delicious cuts of various chicken, pork, beef, and lamb, I was pretty full. Each of them were delectable and unique. I was feeling kind of full but we still had about 1/3 of a bottle of Opus One on the table and even though it was only the 1997, I wasn't prepared to leave it. As one little P.Y. T. came to clear scene of the carnage that was the plates in front of me and my distinguished guests, she ran down the list of desserts. I ordered some incarnation of a chocolate lava cake, my associates ordered the creme brulee and the espresso. All were very good and we were each satisfied. The dessert presentation was tasteful and elegant. When this chick stops blowing up my phone I will try to post a jpg. I need to delete some pics off this thing anyway before my part time lover sees them.    I should mention that the service was impeccable and at no time did I feel rushed, neglected, or what is my biggest pet peeve, hovered over. It was seamless and tactful.   When it was time to return some of the liquor from the night before into Lake Mead the restroom was very clean and it seemed like no one had made number 2 in there all week.   The place was surprisingly reasonable for what you get. Three for lunch with desserts was about $130 before you factor in the wine.  I left feeling satiated and relaxed. The only criticism I have of the place is that when I walked out to my car, there where a couple of chicken heads out there fussing with their hair in the reflection of my Benz. Listen here trick, go inside and use a mirror, not my pearl chariot.   Real talk. This place is good and you should check it out for yourself. Save some cash and go for lunch.",

    "text": "As I write this review, I am ready to go into hibernation. Like a bear storing up for winter, I have gorged on a bounty of meats and greens. In Vegas, the weather is not cold enough and there is never a shortage of food, but that did not stop me from mauling every piece of flesh placed in front of me. The worst part is that I did not even try all 15 types of meat and passed on seconds.  On second thought, I would make a very poor bear. Nonetheless, the 12 kinds of protein that I tried were all amazing. I have tried a few other churrascarias around Las Vegas, but none compare to Fogo in value or quality. The salad bar is fresh and bountiful. One round, and plate stacked high, gave me a taste of everything. The hearts of palm and large asparagus spears are a nice touch to add to my salad.   When it came to meat, the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the Picanha were the stand outs. The latter had a nice crust on it that was juicy yet seared to perfection. Even the chicken was the best I have experienced. Normally, at other places, I take a bite and feel underwhelmed. Not here, it is so moist and flavorful. The caramelized bananas were the only plate they needed to replace several times throughout lunch. I might have liked the fried polenta, but had an insatiable spot for the bananas. I cut myself off at two plates.   If that was not enough, dessert is spectacular as well. My friend and I shared a Chocolate Molten Cake and a slice of Key Lime Pie. Both were exquisite. The chocolate bundt cake had a liquid center that oozed down upon breaking. Served with vanilla ice cream gave a nice contrast of hot and cold. All of that made it better with the contrast to the other dessert. The Key Lime had a tartness that was not overbearing and cleanse the palate of the rich chocolate.  Now in retrospect, I should just tell everyone to read Tony T.'s review, because I echoed everything he said in lesser detail.",

    "text": "I have been to Fogo De Chao several times. You may have been saying the name like it sounds, however a waiter mentioned the last word has a nasal pronunciation like \"choum.\" Once you get past the name, and the front door, with the rotating fire pit of meat, you'll immediately notice several distinctive areas.  Starting from the left, are several rooms for meetings or larger parties. These rooms come equipped with a projector, WiFi & a computer. The manager told me while on a tour, that the spaces can be reserved for no additional cost for up to 200 people. There is no down payment or reservation fee either to reserve a meeting room. There are also no cancellation fees. They just want you to have the best group dinner experience possible. The manager was seen taking others on tours around the restaurant. So if you want one, just ask your waiter.  In the middle of the restaurant, just past the host desk, is the salad bar. The salad bar includes special fresh cheeses, chicken salads, slicked smoked salmon, sliced prosciutto, spinach and fancy lettuce, along with many other options. I have only tasted fresh product from the salad bar. The only downside of such a great selection, is that the specially prepared meat is actually what you come to the restaurant for.  Then, slightly behind the host desk is the wine room. There are bottles of wine ranging from $20 to several hundred & beyond. The latest $65 Cabernet Clos Du Val I had was a good choice & recommended by my waiter.  Finally, towards the right of the restaurant is the bar area. It comes complete with several tables for smaller groups to enjoy beverages. This is a good option for people staying in the near by hotel & office complex, to come and enjoy a relaxing atmosphere, in an international setting.  Once you are seated, they offer many side dishes and sauces to compliment the meal including; rice, black beans in sauce, chimichurri sauce, small cheese breads that are tasty right out of the oven, sweet bananas and a few squares of fried polenta. Individually, they are tasty, but again detract from the main idea of the restaurant, which is the meat.  There are more than a half a dozen meats that will be traveling around on long skewers. These skewers are expertly controlled by executive chefs who individually prepare & cook the meat in the back, on a rotating fire, of about 1,000 degrees. The meat cooks in about three to four minutes, that would normally take about 25 minutes in a normal restaurant. The meat is delivered and carved table-side when you flip your meat card over from red to green. Think of a stoplight. Green means yes please and red means hold up.  My favorite meats are the fillet minion, filet minion wrapped in bacon, chicken legs and chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken is prepared with a beer and cognac sauce, which leaves it crispy and flavorful. The rest of the meats are simply prepared with sea salt. There is a pork that's prepared with parmesan cheese that I did not try, but my table mates said was delicious. After asking around, the parmesan pork is a favorite of the staff.  If you want to try out the restaurant before paying the dinner price, visit during lunch. The menu is the same, just at a reduced rate and for $26, it's a good value. I received a discount on the meal from management. The wine, desserts and remainder of the bill was paid for by my guest. The restaurant is a few blocks East, from the Las Vegas Strip on Flamingo, inside of the Howard Hughes office park, next to the Residence Inn.",

When you're ready for the main course you flip your card over to green and the chefs swoop in like SEAL Team 6 and carve out pieces of steak onto your plate. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped in from the ceiling when you flip your card over. You definitely won't have to wait long trying to flag a chef down. Moreover, If you're waiting for a particular cut of meat the chefs ask what you're waiting for and sends the appropriate dish to your table asap. My favorite has to be the house special (picana sp?), but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   Service is definitely the best in the business too. All the servers and chefs are attentive, and the manager has greeted my table personally every time to make sure everything is perfect. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants, but can get expensive for dinner, so come around lunch time where it's cheaper and still has the full menu!",

We came for lunch on a week day so it wasn't too busy. We started with the salad bar and I was really impressed with the quality of the selections. Definitely a step or 2 up from other salad bars at the buffets.  Everything I tried was delicious and you could tell just by looking that all the vegetables were fresh.  The banana on the side, is DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. We couldn't stop eating it, the soft tender banana with the sweetness from the brown sugar was a really nice contrast of flavors.  The cheese bread was good too, but I think I would get sick of it if I had too much.  I think I limited myself to 2 or 3 rolls during the entire meal.  The meat on the other hand was kind of disappointing because most of it tasted like \"blah buffet meat.\" The only one that was good was the pichana. By the time we realized everything else wasn't worth trying we were already full to get seconds on the pichana. That's okay though because we came here to sample.  The service was of course superb, but I wouldn't expect anything less since this is a classy restaurant.  However, I kinda felt like whenever we asked for something our server was quick and prompt, but he  had a slight \"ugh\" reaction. Maybe it was just me? The entire experience is 4 stars while the meat is a low 2.",

Staff and Food was amazing and they even cooked meat to how each of us liked.  I definately recommend fogo de chao to anyone!",

Fav at this location was  Pork rib The brisket cut  The lamb butterfly  Stay Away from ribeye no flavor compared to other steak houses.    And I was bummed out by beef rib. Was dry compared to Texas de Brazil",

    "text": "Service and food was TOP NOTCH here! I have been to other Brazilian steakhouses before but none can compare to Fogo de Chao! The atmosphere and decor inside makes it a wonderful dining experience.    I came here last week for my first time with my bf thanks to the Yelp Elite Spring Break special of $37/ person. The salad bar had a good variety of salads, cold cut meats, cheeses, and dressing. But the fun didn't start until the meat started flowing in. We turned our paper signs to green to indicate that we were ready for our meat and the waiters did not hesitate in bringing over different types of meat for us to try right away. There were a total of 15 kinds of meat ranging from filet mignon to sausage links to bacon wrapped chicken. I think I tried about 9 of them and was stuffed pretty quickly. They also give you sides of garlic mashed potatoes, pao de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta and caramelized bananas. I tried not to fill up on the sides too much to make room for more meat. The servers and manager came by a couple times to make sure we were served all the meats we wanted to try and to made sure we had refills for our beverages.   Overall, my experience was wonderful. I will definitely be coming back here again in the future to satisfy my craving for Brazilian bbq!",

We got to our table and the waitress failed to get us forks, knives and a meat menu. All we had were water, plates and a butter knife. We had to go and scavenge utensils from another table like we're at a cheap $10 buffet restaurant. The waitress was never seen again until it was time to cleanup and collect her tip. My wife got a bunch of side dishes from the salad bar but I stuck with the meats. The side dishes were underwhelming and not fresh. Maybe because it was around 3 in the afternoon but I still expect fresh food at the cost of $52 a head. Needless to say my wife ended up with the runs right after we got back to the hotel. The meats were good and cooked well. The lamb and picanha were my favorites. The pork rib was way too salty and the cheese bread was probably the most memorable dish. Do yourself a favor and go Texas De Brazil instead. The ambiance, food and service is better across the board at the same price (or less).",

I can officially cross this place off my \"to do\" list because I had the pleasure of having dinner here while in LV this past weekend.    Everything was delicious!  If I had any complaints it would be that the servers didn't bring around the leg of lamb enough for my tastes, but then again, I was too busy stuffing my pie-whole to simply ask for it.  If you've never been to a brazillian-style bbq, then this place is a must.  Bring your A-game appetite, some friends, and a fat wallet...it's pricey, folks!  However, considering how much meat you're being offered (not to mention the salad bar), I would say it's worth the money.",

It's nearly as much as the dinner itself.  OK, that complaint aside, this is a very nice restaurant. Service was excellent. The salad bar was better than average and had a huge variety. The starchy side dishes like bananas and potatoes were brought to the table separately and seemed a little skimpy for our party of six. The meats were numerous and frequent. Many of them were excellent - a few were ordinary. And I got a bite of lamb that was vile, sort of fishy in taste. A nibble on another part of the same cut tasted OK, though. Weird.   We came to this restaurant because we wanted a long, leisurely meal with a bunch of good meat to pair with the good cabernets and pinot. And that's what we got. Maybe we'll go again, and order craft beer, because I don't want to feel resentful about their wine policies again.",

My biggest problem was that the meats were so unbelievably salty! My eight year old who loves her steak couldn't stomach it. Personally I feel as though they over salt so that it makes you thirsty, therefore your constantly having to drink and getting full off the liquid vs the meat. Way overpriced unless your seriously going slam down a ton of meat helpings. It's a cool experience but nothing I'd go back to again. If I'm going to spend money on a delicious steak I'm going to del friscos.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Fogo is an authentic Brazilian Steakhouse chain. They bring the meats on skewers and cut it right in front of you.        - All the meats were, for the most part, medium to rare. They were super juicy and not too salted.        - My must haves would be the Picanhas, filet mignon (Not the one wrapped in bacon), and the beef ribs.        - Prices - Lunch and dinner have exactly the same menu! You're saving $20 just for eating earlier.        - Doneness - When the server cuts the meat for you, they give you a choice. However, it's usually between rare to medium. Just as a warning or a tip, rare is pretty rare.        - By Request - All the meats rotate regularly with the exception of the Beef ribs and the garlic beef.        - Decor/Mood - Classy and pampering. **Price**        - $26.50 Lunch Mon-Fri 11:30am - 2pm        - $46.50 Dinner Mon-Thurs 5pm-10pm & Weekend **Ordered**        - Salad bar - The smoked salmon is a must. Other than that, it's just salads.        - Costela - Beef ribs. They don't come around unless you ask for them. This is by far my favorite. They ribs have just enough fat in them.        - Filet Mignon - There are two types. The huge steak filet was so tender words can't describe. The bacon wrapped one looked dry so I didn't try it.        - Picanhas - House special and perfectly seasoned.        - Cheese Bread - This place definitely has the cheesiest meltiest in your mouth bread. When they come hot out of the oven, I just want to eat it plain.        - Beef Ancho/Alcatra/Fraldinha - Rib-eye/Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin. Cooked perfect and nice and juicy        - Cordeiro - Rack of lamb. Pretty good, but I'd avoid it next time in place of better meats.        - Costela de Porco - Pork Ribs. They were a bit dry and I'd stick to the beef ribs.        - Lombo/Frango/Linguica - Pork Loin/Chicken/Sausage. Didn't really try it.        - Garlic Beef - Didn't get a chance to try it. You have to request it. I found out too late. **Comparing**        - If you've been to the other steak houses in town, here's a comparison section.        - Texas de Brazil - Texas is saltier, the salad bars are about the same. The meats are dryer at Texas.        - Via Brasil - Saltiness is about the same, the salad bar at Via has more hot foods and is more extensive. The meats are juicy, but Fogo has cuts that are more rare than Via.        - Sides - Via Brazil has the most choices and better fried banana. Texas and Fogo have a limited selection. However, Fogo has the best cheese bread.        - For lunch, nothing beats $26.50. It's hands down Fogo.        - For dinner, it depends. If you like your meats rarer, I'd say Fogo. If you like your meats more medium-rare to medium, it's a coin flip. **Recommendations**        - I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a nice treat for a special occasion or in the mood for a ton of perfectly cooked and savory meats.",

My boyfriend and I had reservations right at 4 PM on a sunday, which is when they open. We got seated quickly, and then ventured on to the salad bar. Everything was so fresh and presented so beautifully. I love how they didn't have the typical salad bar items, but instead had things like artichoke hearts, etc. The meats were all delicious, but I particularly liked the bacon wrapped filet mignon. Nom nom! :)  I actually didn't end up eating much of the meat because of the darn cheese bread! It's simply addicting. I couldn't stop eating them :)  Service was perfection, our server (totally forgot his name... Michael? I really need to start writing names down so I can give yelp shoutouts for excellent service :), was very attentive and quick to bring things out. I ordered a drink, but it was INCREDIBLY STRONG, so the waiter actually took it back and had the bartender change it up slightly, so it would be less strong.  For dessert we got creme brulee. If there is room left in the stomach, I hightly recommend it! It was quite delicious.  Though I experienced dinner here, I can't imagine lunch being that much different, so I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch. It's about half the price and the food is pretty much the same. :)",

Their salad bar is awesome and very fresh.  Each meat I've had there (and I've had them all) is always delectable and prepared to perfection.  I can not recommend this place enough!! I tell all of my clients to try this place and they have all loved it!  Thank you Fogo for all the great experiences and for always taking care of my clients!!  WE WILL ALWAYS BE BACK!!",

I've had better. I guess honestly it deserves four stars, I just gave it three because I heard so many good things, I went there with a certain expectation. If I hadn't, I think I might have been less disappointed. Service was stellar. Location was easy to get to, especially for a city girl like myself. All in all, pretty good. If you're unfamiliar with Brasilian BBQ, pretty good becomes delicious. I'm just spoiled.",

The salad bar here was pretty decent. By far my favorite salad bar is in Chi-town. But for a chain this is one of the best chains ever. My only gripe about anything here is their parmesan encrusted pork tenderloin. It was very dry and just not worth eating. I would have much rather had more beef ancho or filet. The cheese bread they put on the table is addictive. I could probably sit there and just eat 5 or 6 bowls of that alone. Before you leave grab a few of their after dinner chocolate mints...they are at the hostess counter.",

I guess we made the cardinal mistake of opting only for the salad bar (we have lived in Brazil for most of our lives and this was never a big issue) when our server sneered at us. We did not know the difference between the salad bar only and all-you-can-eat churrasco option so when we asked the price difference he talked down to us as if we were penny-pinching. When my parents were wondering if we should eat the meat option I responded to the waiter in Portuguese that we would prefer salad service. He, embarrassed that he had treated Brazilians so badly, disappeared presumably to talk to his manager and then came back with a reduced price, which we hadn't asked. This led to an insulting experience for us and an embarrassingly arrogant performance from the server. Next time, we will go to the Texas de Brasil: for the salad... and the churrasco.",

I ended up in Texas de Brazil in which I had an amazing experience! The meats were well seasoned and everything was just delicious. Seeing as how the reviews were really great here, I decided to give this place a chance too.  Idk what was up with that day ( we came july 12th) but all the meats were inedible. The meats tasted raw. I asked for medium well and all i got was bloody raw or overcooked crisps. It was awful. There was no seasoning. I felt kinda bad as the waiters all came up to our party of 6 and offered to bring out new meats but it was just awful. Idk if the chef had a bad day or what but after this experience, I was not impressed.   The salad bar was good though which is what we all filled up on. Other than that, the dining experience was unflavorfed and dull.",

    "text": "I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled.   Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious.   I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes\" were just average. The \"Cheese Bread\" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The \"Carmalized Bananas\" were actually very good, but the \"Crispy Polenta\" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo.   Then dessert came. Fogo claims the \"Papaya Cream\" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished.   Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.",

We had just finished a long couple of days and wanted to celebrate by having a nice dinner.   We were able to call on a Saturday night at 6:30 and get reservations for 8.   Getting there was no problem.   They have valet parking, but they also have a lot that is wide open.   I'm not sure what that's about but, ok.   We self parked because we figured we'd need to walk a little after dinner.    This is a Brazilian steakhouse.   And every selection of meat they brought out was cooked perfectly.   I can't think of anything that I had that I didn't like.   The salad bar was quite nice and of course that was geared toward the carnivore too.   (How awesome is it when the salad bar has strips of bacon?   You have to love that!)   The service was great.   I had to flip my card from green to red a few times just to catch up.   But I was rewarded with an excellent bacon wrapped fillet Mignon.   Wow... that was good.   If you like meat, you'll love this place.  It's not far from the strip.  One cool thing they had was a mobile bar that would come to your table.  The bartender would mix a drink or pour you a shot.   That was a nice touch.   Will I be back?   You bet, I love beef!",

Waiters bring out skewers of different choices of meat from sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork ribs, filet mignon, and parmesan crusted pork. Yes, there is a salad bar, of which i felt like I had to balance out my meal, but not the highlight.  All of the staff bringing out the skewers was overwhelming at first.  I was like can I finish chewing first before you bring out more????  But who was I to say no to more succulent cuts of beef, and ribs, and more beef!  My only \"beef\" hahaha, was that once the staff saw that our party of 12 was slowly putting out their red stop signs, they pretty much stopped entirely while there were a few of us carnivores that were still chowing down.  We had to ask for the filet mignon and the parmesean crusted pork, and even then they brought out one piece of the pork.  C'mon mannnnn!  Gimmee mo' meat! The staff handled our large group well, and even brought out a complimentary order of flan for the guest of honor, which was better than I was expecting since I'm not a big fan of flan.  I will be on the look out for more of Fogo de Chao and other Brazilian steakhouses when I'm on a meat binge.",

Frantically, calling every tons of places they took our request, as well as took our cake for the occasion and brought it out when requested. Those couple of things alone were worth the 4 stars.  We are very familiar with Brazilian steakhouses and know what to expect. The manager who sat us explained everything. He was more informative then friendly. Our server throughout the night however was fantastic and I would request him every time! He just refilled drinks, and took plates but he was on it and we appreciated it. He even noticed when my daughter went to the bathroom with a runny nose and came to check on her to make sure she was ok. The food selection is always brilliant. With the salad bar consisting of rice, beans, salad, cold cuts, cheese, peppers, artichokes, olives, beets, and other eccentric items. There are suppose to be 16 selections of meat, but I will be honest I maybe seen 8-10 of them. It seemed they continuously had the chicken or sausage when our table was wanting filet and garlic sirloin. Although with the exception of the lamb taking a while, when requested everything did come out promptly. Same with the sides, the second I would eat the last sweet banana, here came another plate. Towards the end, we asked that our check be split. (I hate doing this, but was not going to argue with the other parties) They ignored our request and brought out the entire bill. To apologize, the awesome server gave us a free cheesecake. Overall, other than the crudeness of the manager at the beginning and end, it was a great experience.   PS- add risotto to the salad bar like some of the other joints in town!",

He gave us a comp dessert and welcomed us back. Little service steps like that ARE the reasons I would pay more for the same style menu and we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I went on Feb. 15 and this place was more packed that an asian buffet for crab legs. In part it was a little annoying because of the amount of people and the movement of the staff (we where seated next to kitchen entrance).  The food it was good but I had better at Texas de Brasil also more expensive . I didnt see anything special until the end of the meal when they gave my wife a Gift Certificate or a voucher for 1 lunch or dinner on them. That is a big saving but you have to use it in less than a month.  Overall, for the amount of meat and fried banana that I had $51.50(per person) is a little too much. Selection of meats that I saw all around where about 10 counting that you have ask for beef or pork ribs every time , so someone go on the back and get it.  I am not sure if  coming back.",

They had a bunch of big parties while we where there and dropped the ball on getting us our bottle of wine, took them about 20 minutes to bring it out.    But they acknowledged their goof (without us saying anything) and comped our desserts. Thank you for that.  Everyone has rough nights but despite this one mishap they were really awesome.   Even after their goof they were still really awesome!!  The food was excellent on all levels, the meat, the salad bar was all excellent.    I am happy to say i would for sure go back here again!!  Thanks guys for and awesome experience!!",

    "text": "I was reading my first review for Fogo from a year ago and it was drier than a  well-done steak!  Fogo is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I come here a lot and this week, I came here twice...listen to the Duchess (as I'm rolling me eyes at people who make dukedoms a big deal! Haha!)!  This place beats the other churrascarias in town in terms of meat selections, cleanliness and service.  If you want a particular kind of meat, just tell one of the gaucho guys or any of the servers.  As they say here \"we work as a team\".  They won't wait until your glass is empty. It's cheaper if you go during lunch time but you don't get beef ribs.  I'm a big carnivore.  People laugh at me hysterically when I think about becoming vegetarian.  This place is actually great for both carnivores and herbivores.  Although you'll get your money's worth if you eat steaks than just get stuff from the salad bar.  They give you fried polenta, mashed potatoe, fried bananas (helps you cut the fattiness of the meats) and pao de queijo/ cheese bread/ popovers.  THE MEATS: They recently added Fogo steak to their meat line-up - it has a thicker layer of fat.  Picanha/house special top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet, rib eye, alcatra, filet wrapped in bacon, chicken, chicken breast wrapped in bacon, leg of lamb, lamb chops, beef ribs (not available during lunch), garlic sirloin, pork loin, pork ribs, sausage and rib eye.  My favorites are: garlic sirloin (very garlicky), picanha (thin layer of slightly crisp fat) and bacon-wrapped filet...all cooked medium rare, of course.  All meats are tender and flavorful.  THE SALAD BAR: They have soup, tabbouleh, beans and rice. Non-veggie items: bacon, cheeses (parmesan, mozzarella, manchego), salami, prosciutto and smoked salmon.  Veggies: lettuce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, heart of palm, artichoke bottoms, peppers, etc. with different salad dressings (I like basil pesto). Last night, I had a crazy idea of just doing the salad bar.  I survived not eating steaks but I know I over-payed for a loaded plate of veggies, smoked salmon, bacon, cheese, prosciutto and a basket of pao de queijo for $28.  THE DRINKS: My favorite is their Brazilian lemonade.  It's lime juice blended with condensed milk...it's non-alcoholic but it's way better than it sounds.  I get this all the time...free refills!  You have to have a caipiranha or two.  Last night, I had a Strawberry Lemonade Acai Caipiranha...it was strongly delicious.  It has Acai Spirit, Grand Marnier, Sprite, lemon and muddled strawberries.  I would also recommend the Melon Coconut Lime Caipiranha - coconut rum, cachaca, melon liqueur and muddled lime.  THE DESSERTS: Papaya Cream, Strawberry Cream, Key Lime, Flan, Molten Chocolate Cake...but my absolute favorite is their South American Flan (tastes just like how my mom used to make it). It's creamy and sweet...very delicious!  The basics: if you're still eating your salad or if you're not ready for meaty goodness, flip your card red side up.  If you want meat to keep coming, flip the card green side up.  If you don't like a certain kind of meat and a gaucho guy approaches you, you may politely refuse.  You don't have to keep using the same plate.  If you're just doing the salad bar, don't freak out when they take away your flip card and tongs - you won't need those. They have private rooms if you have special occasions/ meetings.  I've used them before and it was great. Obrigada!",

The only thing was I wished I prepared my appetite for such a feast. My husband & I both had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse but boy did we find out real quick what it was all about. I loved all of the sides that you had to choose from. It was almost overwhelming. When they ask you if you want more bread just say, \"YES.\" Those things were to die for. So fluffy, light & cheesy. The coolest part of the experience has to be the numerous Carvers coming up to your table ready to serve you quality cuts of meat cooked to perfection. Everything from lamb, bacon wrapped filet, chicken, ribs, etc. Absolutely no exceptions, no matter what you MUST try the house special Sirloin. Turn your coaster over to the red side when you've had enough but turn it back over to the green side when you're ready for the Carvers to come running back. It's all you can eat so make the most if it. A carnivores dream come True. This restaurant was plan B on our dinner list for the night but it definitely turned into an amazing culinary experience.",

    "text": "This was our first time dining at this restaurant(the Flamingo location ) and was expecting  a wonderful dining experience paired with deliciously flavorful  food. Unfortunately,  the anticipation did NOT meet the expectation. I'd made reservations for 3,  a week in advance for  7:00 p.m. on a Saturday  night. When we arrived , we were promptly seated to a poor attempt to replicate a  white linen table setting. The wine glasses were dull and water spotted from what I can only guess , were ran through a hard water dishwashe.The linen had food/liquid stains (I hope) and  ink pen markings (I guess from either the previous guest signing their check or a toddler drawing pictures). Black linen napkins ? Humph? After observing the white table covering..leaves you to wonder the cleanliness of the napkins to wipe up after the meal. The wait staff.After being asked 3 times by 3 different  staff members, (each speaking just one decibel shy of screaming macaw), if we'd been to the restaurant before , rattled off scripted instructions for the dining service. The first staff member , a young female, with a high pitched voice , made no eye contact, had a bed head hairstyle  pulled back and had on a wrinkled shirt. We saw her as we sat through her pitch but  never again after that. In comes  Joshua our waiter (I'd hoped ). We listened again to the hurried script then  was awarded with a long wait before we ever received the water we 'd ordered . Then he disappeared. Only to reappear after awhile. .. Him -\"Oh , yeah?! ...I will bring the garlic mashed potatoes and  the fried plantains \"  US- \" Oh, boy ! Can't wait!). I ordered a glass of wine. ..which Josh, appeared to almost forget ask if I would like to sample or \"taste\" before beginning to pour,  then catching himself to wait for my response after pouring. We saw him in passing once or twice times more, as he walked by our table during dinner, casually asking is everything OK. He really didn't give a damn. The food. The salad bar had a nice presentation but appeared picked over and unreplenished. The  red meats were NOT seasoned, leaving you to look for a sauce or \"something \" to make it palatable and   Dessert. I ordered Creme Brule . That was cold. A third staff member stopped by  our table to drop off/pu our bill...after my husband unsuccessfully attempted to raise  Joshua's attention  for the bill which for 2 people was  $145.00 , that included three alcoholic beverages,  plus  a generous $40.00 cash tip. Dining experience rated 2 stars. I hit the third star by mistake. Just want to add, I am a Vegas native and know when food is good and hospitality is exquisite.  I dine out frequently and have ate  at some of the best restaurants this town has to offer. This particular restaurant...at this location and the service just did not live up to its expectations.",

I made a reservation but it took over half an hour to be seated.  The wait for our drinks was unacceptable.   The salad bar had been destroyed and most items had not been replaced. The sides (mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried bananas) were cold. We waited for 20 minutes to get our check.  As a result, we were late for another engagement. I realize the rodeo was in town, but this was an unacceptable experience for the price of dinner.  When I brought up the issue with management I was told, \"I don't know what to say.  The rodeo is in town.\"   Honestly.  It happens every year, right?  Plan accordingly.  I'm very disappointed with my experience and the response from management.",

First time was at the Beverly Hills location and have to say... wasn't very impressed, especially considering the high $$$ that I had to pay.  I went on Friday for lunch right after they opened but there was already multiple parties that were there before me. I did the 'full experience' which allowed me to choose items at the salad bar and try whatever meat I wanted as many times as I wanted.   When I dined in at Beverly Hills location, I was given meat that were over cooked and very dry... very disappointing. This wasn't the case at the Las Vegas location though! Meat was perfectly cooked at medium rare, all of their meats were very juicy as well. Only down side was that I had a few times where the meat was too salty which was pretty disappointing. *4 stars for the food.  Service here was very good for the most part. I forgot the gentleman's name but there was one person that offered high quality customer service. However his service was offset by a different gentleman who seemed semi-hostile like whenever I declined whatever meat he was offering. *4 stars for the service.  Restaurant was very clean and had great music playing in the background as well. Overall I really enjoyed my experience and will probably come back if it's this location... Free parking was a great plus as well (I had to pay $15 for valet parking at the Beverly Hills location... I will never go back there).",

So within our group we were celebrating 2 birthdays and a wedding anniversary which certainly created for a heck of an atmosphere (ambiance and we were given free deserts for each event which is always appreciated),  but what the manager Ricardo did for our group was way beyond anything we imagined.  Halfway through dinner he came to check on our table (I'd like to think it had to do with me checking in and my previous 5 star rating on Yelp that got us what's coming up) ha-ha. He came over and asked us if we wanted to take a tour of the kitchen and we all looked at each other wide jawed about even getting the chance to do that, but none of us wanted to say no to that.  It was a once in a lifetime event let me tell you. All employees (which none of us knew) are executive chefs and the meat they bring out is specifically cooked by them as they are allotted to that particular meat preparation for the night. The meat itself cooks in roughly about 3-5 minutes only due to the extremely hot rotisserie oven they have so that definitely explains why the service is always a well oiled machine.    Being able to see Fogo behind the scenes was amazing and one experience I will never forget. However it did give me a new found appreciation (not that I didn't have it before) for the preparation and end result that is Fogo De Chao!",

After about 30 minutes these 2 guys next to me were having the following conversation \"Our reservations  were for 8:00 but they said that they were still working on the 7:30 reservations\"  Reservation problems aside this was a top not food orgy; I think I ate about 6 lobs of meat and it was very very good.",

Fresh fruit, salads, cheese, meats, marinated mushrooms, olives and more. Once you are ready for the main meats you just flip over a little card and they start coming over offering whatever they have. Leg of lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, prime rib, lamb chop, sausage...etc. everything was delicious. I especially liked the leg of lamb. We also decided to get dessert. We tried the tres leches and one piece was plenty for my boyfriend and I to share. The tres leches was probably the best I've ever had. The whole meal was just incredible. If you've ever seen the movie National Lampoons European Vacation where Audrey falls asleep on the plane and has her dream where the food just keeps coming....it was kind of like that but enjoyable lol. You get a bit of lamb chop and someone comes over offering prime rib.  The servers where fantastic as well. Never had to ask for more water. Didn't have to wait for someone to come around with meat. Everyone was friendly, asking if we needed anything, did we want a specific meat brought over. This isn't just eating out this is like a whole dining experience. I highly recommend!",

Our server explained everything to us Ricardo came over to check on us and no shortage of food! The salad bar alone is to die for everything fresh and many choices! You could make a meal out of the salad bar alone! We were always asked which meat we wanted and how we wanted it! Our server from the prime rib loft should take a lesson from these folks on customer service! If it comes down to saving 15.00 bucks on a meal or coming hear I say Fogo all the way! The chocolate lava cake was fantastic! 2hr dinner with friends with a great atmosphere we were treated like house guests just amazing!",

    "text": "One word...WOW!!  My sister and I were going to be in LV for my birthday and after looking at reviews for all the Brazilian Steakhouses there, she decided we were going to try Fogo.  We were definitely not disappointed!  We were warmly greeted by a woman (sorry, I didn't get her name) who seated us and proceeded to explain how the system works.  We knew we were in for a dining adventure!  For starters we had Brazilian limeades...they were fabulous!!  We were then greeted by the manager (Ricardo), he made us feel like family.  On to the salad bar, everything there was perfect to accompany the long list of beef, pork, and chicken choices.  My favorites were the grilled eggplant and asparagus.  Back at the table, we flipped over our service rounds to green (green for GO; orange for HOLD UP) and was immediately surrounded by several gentlemen all offering skewers of delectable delights.  When they are slicing, you are given tongs to receive your choice, so interactive!  After the first serving, we flipped our service rounds back over to orange and proceeded to enjoy our selections.  The woman who initially seated us, came by and asked us what else we wanted to try.  We asked for more beef and also the pork ribs, she immediately flagged down two servers to come to our table (and we didn't even have to flip our services rounds!).  Ricardo also came by again to ask us how it was going and to wish me a happy birthday!  Aside from mentioning my birthday while reserving my table through Open Table, we had not mentioned celebrating my birthday to anyone at the restaurant.  After another round of meat and another trip to the salad bar, we were done!  But not yet!  A server came by with a special birthday dessert...creme brulee topped with blueberries and strawberries with a separate plate with Happy Birthday written around the plate and a strawberry with a candle in it!  Ricardo came by again with a couple more Happy Birthday wishes, I felt so special!  It was an outstanding dining experience made all the more special by the great food and exceptional service!  If you're ever in LV and want to try the Brazilian Steakhouse, make a point for going to Fogo de Chao, you will not be disappointed!",

Food overall is good (thus the two stars), but I'm not rating that for now.   Last time I was there, the waiters were very unprofessional. Perhaps, it was not a busy day, but i thought that staying together in one area as a group--chatting, gossiping, I really don't care what they are discussing about--in front of guests is not appropriate in a place as fancy as this. I mean, they were just there, talking, not minding their customers. To be honest, I felt uncomfortable asking my waiter anything because it felt like I was interrupting their conversation. They didn't come back to check if the customers needed anything, except if they were actually called on. It was not a good experience for me (and the people I was with) even if the food and ambiance were great, and it was upsetting that we paid a lot to have service as such. Bottom line: not coming back again (unless if someone's paying). Anyways, there are other Brazilian places in town that I haven't tried so maybe it's time to explore some place else.",

When we asked to speak to a manager to see if this is True, due to the large amount that was quoted , we were met with a rude reply. So the six of us just got up and went next door. Their neighbor was more than happy to accommodate us in only charge us $15 for a corkage fee. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind paying a little more for corkage fee at a nice restaurant, but really it's just a glorified buffet. The sad part is we probably would have dropped about $600 that night. Maybe we'll go to Texas de Brazil next time .",

My bf never went to Texas de Brazil before so we just went recently and he thought it was good.. but I knew there was better .. and here it is!    The service here was GREAT, although I did knock off one star .. will explain later.  The servers knew the menu and offerings very well.  The salad bar was simple but very good, although some labels would have helped.  The meat selection was amazing, especially the filet, MUCH better than Texas de Brazil.    Now one star was taken off b/c it took about 20-25 minutes for us to get our check.  We asked a server for a dessert menu and instead he had a server recite the menu to us.  She was very knowledgeable of the dessert menu, which was great, but I couldn't remember everything she said, so she gave us a dessert menu and never came back.  Finally after waiting 20 minutes we flagged down a server to get our check and just skip dessert.  I think b/c they all work together and there's no designated server, no one knows to come back and check on tables.  I saw another review saying their sides were replaced promptly, which was not the case for us, as he replaced our sides after our plates were already taken.   But overall food and service was great, I'd still come back again and now I know what dessert I want to try without having to ask for the menu!",

It looked pretty busy so I think the reservation was a good idea. It saved us about a 30 minute wait time. The hostess was awesome and very patient when explaining the serving process. Which is pretty interesting if you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, but I won't spoil it!  We started with the salad which I had a heard from others that they could be better but I wasn't there for the salad anyway so I didn't pay to much attention to it but It was tasty. Then it was time for the real deal, the meats. My girlfriend said it reminded her of her grandfathers cooking! That's when I knew it was authentic Brazilian. I was speechless the flavors the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat was INCREDIBLE! My girlfriend was also super excited about the Guarana which is her all time favorite soda from Brazil!   She still wanted one more test. When one of the gauchos came to our table she asked him what meat it was in Portuguese and HE RESPONDED!!! I don't think they all speak Portuguese but the fact that one did told us that they really did bring the culture and the authenticity to the table. The food was amazing and the service was impressive. Definitely going back! This is as Brazilian as Vegas gets!",

All were cooked to perfection and full of flavor.  The filet mignon felt like heaven for my mouth.  My husband got all of above and pork ribs, which were so tender it literally fell off the bone. The wait staff was superb.  Never an empty glass, not even half empty.  Also should a meat server come and he didn't have what you wanted, simply mentioned what you wanted and within minutes they are back with your request.  The price is high but in my opinion, well worth it for the amount and Quality of the food. I was so pleased I even left one of the biggest tips I've ever given for a two person meal.  I will continue to visit when we come yearly for conferences.  And I will highly recommend to everyone I meet.",

Honestly, the dessert flan they brought out for a birthday was freaking awesome and probably my favorite part of the meal. Nice spot and maybe I'll be back in the future and I'll try to be hungrier next time!",

The service is impeccable and the quality is superb! I only eat from the salad bar and that alone is worth the cost! My bf and friends always gorge themselves on the 16 types of meat ohing and ahing the whole time. I love the fried polenta and cheese balls that comes with the meal too!  If you can't afford the dinner price definitely go for lunch it's all the same thing for almost 1/2 the dinner price!",

    "text": "Perfectly grilled slaughtered muscle meats and surrounding animal fats of various parts of the dead cow and other animals skewered onto 3 ft pitchforks nicely salted over charcoal fired flame and all served and thinly sliced for you at your table by simply flipping your chip green as in go on your table. A True cave man's dream delight.  You can easily destroy a months worth of red meat in just one sitting.    Ambiance, service, quality and quantity of food are five star.  Tip: ask for the picanha fresh off the grill and make sure you get the first outside cuts which have the most flavor from the salt and charcoal.  Don't even bother for the less tasty second inner cuts.  Even if you are vegetarian, their salad bar alone is a five star vegetarian's wet dream.  I've been to fogo de caos all over the country and they all have nice but different interior designs. If you can make it to their beverly hills location, it is quite impressive.",

The three sides brought to the table included yummy fried polenta and fried plantains (but the mashed potatoes were boring). The service was good, if not over the top. It was an expensive, but delicious and memorable meal during our Vegas vacation. Now that I've discovered Fogo de Chao, I hope to visit the location near me soon.",

Thank you hubby for the most amazing surprise - he told me we were going to the steakhouse at Silver Seven and I believed him!  Super friendly attentive service throughout.  Started out with pineapple-lime Caphrinas - so delicious that my friend and I each had three!  Was surprised that it added $90.00 to the bill but they were deelish!  The salad bar is so fresh with tons to choose from - but being a fan of Texas de Brazil and Via Brasil - I knew to not be tempted too much -a small caesar salad with crunchy bacon on top is all I grabbed.  Our friendly server brought out their amazing cheese biscuits -interesting tidbit - they are actually GF- they are made with yucca flour so no gluten!  We kept gobbling them up.  Soon we moved our cards to green and I was blown away by all the amazing meat! I won't go into the same detail as discussed below but the pichana and garlic filet were my",

Let me first say the customer service was absolutely amazing the lady who served us was very patient and she explained every thing to us and constantly tended to us , and basically it's all you can eat for $50 a person and there was a salad bar. The salad bar basically has EVERYTHING from kale to beets to fruits to potatoes to everything ! I wish I utilized the salad bar more but I had to make room for all the meats !! Basically there's a red card with a green side on the other side and if you flip your card to green then all these guys holding different types of meats come to your table offering you different types of meat ! You can choose medium , medium rare or rare and they'll cut you a small slice and you just grab it with your mini tongs . Let me tell you this was so fun and it was so delicious trying all the different types of meat , I loved the sirloins and I loved the bacon meats and I just omg everything was so freaking good . And after so many meats I got really full but made room for a dessert and I got the strawberry cream and that was amazing . This place is totally worth the $50 I'm definitely coming back again but probably by myself because I loved it so much HAHA don't judge me .",

    "text": "Amazing churrascaria! This was my first experience in one, and if all of them are like this, I have been missing out!  I went for a friend's birthday while in Las Vegas and it was our one nice dinner for the trip. Walking in, I was not expecting such nice decor since it was AYCE. It was layed out like a nice steakhouse.   The wait staff gives you a short introduction about how the churrascaria works. There is an open salad bar and you have a coaster for when you want to get the meats. Green means bring on the meat and red lets the staff know that you need a break.   I got a few things from the salad bar, but didn't want to fill up on it. Ingredients were fresh and they even have smoked salmon and bacon. They also give side dishes to share. Fried banana(delicious), polenta, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls (awesome!) The fun comes next. As you turn your coaster over to the green side, you'll be attacked from all sides by dudes with sharp knives. There are like 15-16 different meats to choose from. After the first three or four, I had to turn my coaster to the red side to let them know I wanted a break. Everything looked super delicious but I knew if I kept getting the meat, it would turn cold. Everything is quaility and cooked superbly. I love my meats rare/medium rare. They were able to accomodate. Meats were seasoned well and I didn't find anything that was tough or chewy.   I found myself eating a lot of meat and bananas and not wasting too much stomach space on salad and potatoes. Also, on the table is a menu of all the meats, if you didn't see something that you like and want to try, you can always ask the staff and they'll bring the right guy to your table. One of those dishes I asked for was the garlic top sirloin. You probably can't go wrong with any of the meats you ask for, but surprisingly, one of the best was the chicken leg. It came out on the skewer with you choice of a pork sausage or chicken leg. After I asked for the chicken, the server said it was an excellent choice. It didn't dissapoint. Very moist, flavorful and good amount of char.   I'm glad my friend chose this for her birthday meal. It was a delightful eating experience.",

The facility, staff, food variety were 95% of the way there...but just not quite as nice.  That being said, I did manage to enjoy a couple pounds of deliciously cooked meat.  I would never object to going back, but by the same token, I would not choose it over Texas de Brazil.  The price for dinner was $51.50 per person, not including drinks...or desert, if somehow anyone saves room for that.  Our reservation was for 5:30p on a Friday night and we were seated directly upon arrival.  Parking was ample, plus valet is available, if for some reason you don't mind a stranger in and driving your car.",

Some of the meats needed additional salt, seemed bland. As far as the Salad Bar, wasn't impressed at all. Having lived in Brazil, I was looking forward to the black beans (Feijao) and rice with farofa. It was super bland.... needed a lot of salt to taste good. The rest of the salad bar items were just ok in my opinion. Wasn't too happy about getting offered shrimp, just to find out it was an additional $20 added to your bill. Not cool. In the end we weren't upset with experience but will never return again. There are a few better options in Las Vegas. It's also more expensive than some other restaurants with same style of food. The one positive thing that my wife was very grateful for was the Servers going out of their way to bring her well done meat as she is pregnant and can't eat the meat rare.",

First let me say the service here is OUTSTANDING, I have not received service like this in a long time if ever. Our server Thompson, was Johnny on the spot with everything, while not being intrusive. One of the adults was just about to eat some food with his hands due to a dropped silverware by his son. When Thompson hands him some more without ever being asked, again awesome service.  Food was all absolutely delicious, the filet mignon was about the only thing I didn't care for. My favorites were the flank steak followed by the house special with the garlic steak right behind it. As far as the salad bar, if you need a bigger one go find a sizzlers or souplantation. This place is for carnivores!  In my opinion the best Brazillian Steakhouse I have ever been to. I now have a added spot when visiting Vegas. Well done to all the staff there.",

Great variety from basic greens and Caesar salad to my favorite, apple salad.  The meats are all delicious. As compared to a traditional steakhouse where you can only have the single steak you ordered, here you get to sample everything from flank to filet to lamb chop to chicken.  You walk out feeling stuffed, but that's why you go to a place like this.  Went here for my bachelor party last year and they gave us some free flan for the occasion. I didn't think any of us had any room for dessert, but with flan like they make here, you always make room.",

There was several waiters and waitresses flirting around with little regard to customer needs. The bread was so cold. The bananas were microwaved and cold. We brought up our concerns to the manager, Tracy and he got extremely defensive and unprofessional. Under his management, I can see why the staff is so nonchalant and disrespectful. For a $260 lunch date, we would have probably gotten better service and food at a Wendy's. We will not be returning and I will be escalating my concerns to corporate. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday but fogo is always prime in our eyes due to the consistency between locations and cities. This one did not meet expectations.",

    "text": "Fogo De Chao is about a mile off the strip behind Hard Rock...after eating here, I completely kick myself for not having discovered them sooner.  The dinner is $51.50 and completely worth it.  It was so good that I asked if they catered or sold their meat to go.  (Alas, they do not.)  The Hubs and I were on a mission to try it all and...we did.  My top choices in respective ranking:  #1: Tender lamb chops #2: Lombo - parmesan crusted pork loin #3: Picanha - garlic & sea salt sirloin #4: Linguica - pork sausages  The lamb chops were so tender and juicy with a salty savory seasoning.  The lombo had some nicely seared edges but the salty cheese encrusted on it was what won me over.  The picanha was aggressively garlicy but does not linger on the palate.  The linguica were plump and beautifully seasoned.  Yum!!  Meats that we could have skipped over were the Alcatra & Fraldinha which are the top & bottom sirloin.  Delicious but nothing spectacular.  Their salad bar is fresh & always stocked on a regular basis.  I loved the roasted & marinated veggies as a balance to all the meat.  Their complimentary sides were also amazing; smooth garlic mashed potatoes, carmelized bananas & super crunchy polenta fries.    The manager suggested we get one of each & share it...and then get more of what we liked.  Such a great tip!  Their amazing staff will go back into the kitchen & either get what you're looking for or tell the waiter who has it to come to you.   A solid 5 stars on the food, sides, salad bar, staff, efficiency & parking lot!  Definitely will be back!  :)",

Seriously the place is great, but a little greedy by charging $7.50 for water and $3.50 for tiny little sample size three swallow bottles of Joke Coke, chances are if you're there you can afford the $56.00 per person charge and beverage/water price gauging, but....I see you Fogo I see you! You would have had a perfect score had the greed not been so blatant.  We go for the meat and there is plenty of it, the ribeye was amazing, it's too bad they brought it out last and when I say last I mean last, when they see you cannot take another bite....when you're already stuffed because they pushed the sirloin all night, I get it....I see you!

The salad bar area did not impress me and I noticed a few of the bowls, especially with cheese, to be empty or nearly empty.  Meat selections were adequate, but the only meat that I though was notable was the pork chop. The beef and chicken were average, as was the sausage.   After drinks were ordered it took some time for the first server to arrive with a skewer of meat. As there were about 15 in our party, it tool a lot of time for that single skewer to get around the table. The timeliness of the meat servers was poor.",

    "text": "I have to say I am truly disappointed at the quality of food that was served here. Came here for Valentine's day celebration. They offer one complimentary dinner/lunch dining card if you dine with them Feb 10th thru February 17th. We made a reservation prior to our dinner which was a great move. When we arrived, there were so many people waiting for a table.   We arrived 20 minutes earlier, but was able to be seated at our reservation time. There was a huge salad bar section. Their salad items are freshly made!..I like its kale salad and its apple salad.   They offered a great selection of meat. Most of meats i have tried are mostly OVERCOOKED..even though i asked for medium rare, but most of meats are more like medium well. It was really hard for me to chew its rib eye, sirloin, lamb legs,  rack of lambs. The only type of meat that was cooked and seasoned perfectly was its filet Mignon. Most of meats are lack of seasonings and tasted pretty bland. I soon lost my appetite b/c all the meats are kinda blah...  I have noticed that they serve mostly top sirloin. I only saw filet Mignon served ONCE to us and we had to specifically asked for rack of lambs. All we saw are other type of meats (Top Sirloin the mosts)..I would say they purposely serve the cheaper meats...i would consider rack of lamb and filet Mignon more expensive, but only saw Filet Mignon ONCE and rack of lamb (saw it for ONCE..but it was soon gone..and had to ask for it specifically)..  Be cautious when they offer shrimp cocktails and champagne. Servers were walking around with shrimp cocktails and champagne. I thought they were included as part of \"All-You-Eat\" experience especially for the shrimps..but found out they charge EXTRA for that!...i believe the shrimp cocktails was over TWENTY DOLLARS...i was not too impressed by its shrimp cocktails..tasted kinda bland..  Overall, not super impressed by its quality of food. And they should have served more rack of lambs or filet Mignon if I am paying almost 60 dollars per person..I would rather go to a nice restaurant to get quality meal than a mediocre dinner..",

Though I don't eat here often is always a great indulgence to feast at the huge salad and side dish bar before being served at your table with all kinds of meats. The salad bar has Italian meats, cheeses, Fruits, vegetables, Ceasar Salad,  etc. They'd even rice and beans and a few soups.  Then when you are ready,  flip your circle over from red to green and the professional servers begin appearing Weyerhaeuser chicken, pork,  filet and lamb.   Go slow!  And flip the little circle to red to stop the servers from coming by while you enjoy.  Only choose what you want.  If you've never been,  I'd say go!",

I truly felt that the staff cared about giving us a kind, attentive overall, enjoyable experience.  I'd like to give a particular thanks to the manager Tracy and his team.

Each offered various amounts of 'done'- rare, medium, well- done. There is absolutely nothing like this that I know of in the Midwest. A must eat!",

    "text": "What a wonderful place! Not only is the staff helpful and attentive, but the food is amazing.  Upon entering, you are greeted with a salad and meat and cheese bar with a plethora of choices. You are also given a basket of cheese bread which is delicious. They are tiny rounds of bread mixed with cheese, giving it a dense, spongy texture with a crisp outer shell.   You are also given some side dishes to accompany the meats you will be given. You are given mashed potatoes (which was mediocre), but the sweetened plantains and fried polenta were delicious.  Now for the main event. My absolute favorite was the prime rib and filet mignon. I thought it was incredible that they could slice you a medium rare all the way to a medium well piece of meat from the same piece! I always opted for medium, and they were always a perfect cut. The meat was juicy and tender and flavorful. We also tried the short ribs and chicken, which also had tender meat. The pork tenderloin with parmesan was juicy and cut like butter. Now this is the section where I gave this restaurant a four instead of a five rating; some of the meats were salty. From the meats I had, the pork was the saltiest. And on only parts of the filet mignon (not the entire thing, odd enough), was salty. This made me not want to finish the meat because the saltiness was overpowering.  To end the wonderful meal, we had a slice of the Tres Leches cake, and wow. The cake was extremely moist and was sweet, but not too sweet.   Definitely an experience everyone should try. Amazing place!",

Starting with the 30 + minute wait for our reservation beyond our reserved time.  Then, this is the LOUDEST restaurant in LV and that's saying a lot.  Then, the salad bar is sorely lacking compared to the others we've been to.  Really limited selections.  With the sides being white rice and black beans?  Then the meat - it just wasn't prepared as well as we are used to.  I ate very little and my friend ate like a bird.  The service - so so.  $400 later (including gratuity) we figured we could have gone to a really nice steakhouse and enjoyed it more.  So sorry that I cannot recommend.",

    "text": "Different concept in all you can eat dining. That is - servers walk around to offer varieties, versus only a buffet style get up and get your own. But you still had to get up and get your own veggies, salads, soup, snack type cuts etc. Easy to get stuffed. So if you want to try most the served meats, limit your buffet plate fills.  First time to try Brazilian cuisine and if anything, I give 5 stars to the carved meat flavors. I don't care much for the flip coaster - green for 'yes more meat'. It was just another task to remember to do while enjoying a meal. Also, when we had the red flipped for no meat, it didn't work. The servers were happy to offer the roast on their large metal skewers regardless.  I don't eat this much meat ever, so the restaurant isn't one I'd dine often. It is a treat for protein eaters and recommend for those who diet this way. They serve everything for carnivores: chicken, pork, lamb, beef. My favorite flavors were the pork roast and NY cut, though these meats aren't my normal protein choices; I enjoyed them.  If you can't have fine dining without a cocktail, I suggest Brazilian Nights. It's like a martini, punches with the all savored ingredients. The sweet does pair well with the meat somehow; at least I thought so.  Nice place to celebrate any occasion. Location is off strip which makes parking easy. In addition, valet is complimentary! Nice interior, not too dim. They have a visible wine cellar. Service is constant. A table may have several servers. One was even super friendly to have a conversation with us; and we learned from each other - story tellers lounge kinda atmosphere.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for the Las Vegas Restaurant Week $40 dinner special last night and what a deal!  This was my first visit to Fogo and it left a great impression.  First of all, the $40 promotion to benefit Three Square Food Bank appealed to us because this dinner is usually about $20 more on the regular menu AND my husband needs that protein.  The Brazilian steakhouse experience is included, which means all access to the salad bar complete with soup, rice, black bean stew (feijoada), and more.  Sides are also all-you-can-eat ,which were that addicting cheese bread (pao de queijo), crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas.  The main course is the meat which includes most of the offerings on the regular menu for Restaurant Week except filet mignon and maybe one or two other meats.  However, we were quite satisfied with what we had with favorites being the Picanha (top sirloin) and Fraldinha (bottom sirloin).  Dessert choice for both of us was the Tres Leches cake, which we somehow had room for--delicious!  Service was quite attentive, especially for such a busy establishment.  You can't wrong with this kind of meal, especially if you are a carnivore, that also benefits a wonderful charity.  I'm sure we'll be back!",

The day of the reservation 12/31/18 was a HIT! We had a private room, that made the occasion even more intimate. This event was very special to us, and we are so pleased we chose Fogo for this venue! They had the perfect salad bar (aka the Market Table) with an array of vegetables, garnishes, soups, pasta, dozens of fresh fruits, cold meats and cheeses (I know I missed something). Oops I got distracted, as we all know, it's not just about the salad bar at Fogo de, I made sure I had enough room for more than a few helpings of meat! Oh! I've been here before, I made sure I took it easy on the Market Table! Fogo's entree's were juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Staff was great! They knew \"green\" card was keep it coming! So thanks Fogo de for covering all the basis on this special day for our mom's birthday! Communication was smooth and easy, Service was fantastic, Private room was perfect and thank you for allowing us to decorate for the occasion, and of course! The meal was delicious! I forgot about the desert! But my family loved it! Fantastico ....",

My only knock on the whole evening was that the guys serving the beef options were hard to find. We had to have our waitress go find a couple of them and send them our way. The guys serving pork, lamb, chicken and sausage were at our table every time our coaster was green. Only saw the beef guys 2 times.

    "text": "We made reservations on Christmas Eve for our small family of 3. We sat in a smaller dining area, separate from the large warmly lit room where the salad bar is located. It was very bright and very noisy, which detracted from the intimate family experience I was hoping for.  The premise here is you pay one price (on this holiday it was $56 each) for unlimited trips to the salad/antipasto bar, and gauchos walk around with a variety of wood-fired meats; you indicate if you want to try their offerings by turning over a red placard to green. There are also servers who check in at tables. As we were seated, a server asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water, not mentioning that it is not included in the price of dinner, so we paid an additional $8 for water. We were given side dishes at the table- potatoes, bread, plantains, and a shrimp cocktail- but again were not told the shrimp was an additional charge ($20!). The salad bar offerings are top-notch: marinated olives, prosciutto, fresh fruit. The gauchos offered chicken, pork sausage, flank steak, and lamb, all delicious- however, they didn't make it into our side room very often and my husband actually had to flag one down more than once. Also, the servers didn't check back very often- I waited quite a long time for them to notice our glasses were empty, and even longer for the check. Dessert is not included in the price, and I recommend if you choose to order, get one and share as they are very generous servings. It was very busy with large family celebrations, which probably explains the lack of attention, but for the price and atmosphere, I do have high expectations of service. Overall, this was a 3.5 experience.",

The last time we went here for dinner, the staff tried to upsell us while we are having our meal. Does this mean the normal meat is not good? I cannot believe they did this to us while trying to enjoy our dinner. Will question if I take my team here on our next visit in Vegas in June.",

    "text": "I came here recently because I had a great experience at Texas de Brazil and I wanted to try another Brazilian steak house.  The meat here are very well cooked and comparable to Texas de Brazil. The only difference I found was that I felt like the meat here was a tad bit saltier which my girlfriend was really happy about.   My favorite item here was the beef rib just like at Texas de Brazil. The one thing that Texas has over fogo is their lobster bisque! However, I will come back again as we received a buy one get one free coupon when we recently came here!  Also, the service was awesome, I had no complaints!",

We've been back at least 3 times, once on New Year's and once on the evening before Easter.  It must've been a coincidence that on both times before I wrote that review, there were multiple wedding parties at the restaurant, taking up the salad bar.  Since that review, we've had ZERO problems with lines, even when it's busy on a holiday.  The service is exceptional and we have frequent stops from many different employees making sure we have what we need.  I am definitely updating my review to reflect their great service.",

Lamb chop and prime beef cut is of good quality as well, 4 stars for that. Lamb leg and prom ribs are bland. 2 stars, they could use more seasoning on those. Chicken leg is absolutely disgusting... seriously, I have never tasted any chicken leg worse than that.   Literally just an evenly cooked/salted drumstick, skip this one if you could. The whole buffet part is skippable as well, there is nothing really editable compared to their top notch steak cut. Uncleaned salad leaves and unpeeled pineapple cuts, wtf.  I am super speechless on everything else besides their super cuts. They have so many great materials  but sadly they don't know how to cook them well.",

When one of my friends was seved sausage, I wanted a taste. The staff swept over to our table like I was stealing the Mona Lisa!   They instructed me that if I took even one bite of a sausage they would charge me an additional $51, as I would have crossed the menu into the prix fix meat side and have to pay for that option on top of my salmon.  I was glad to be made aware of their prix fix, but the ridigity seemed extreme for a restaurant that considers itself upscale.  I know of no other \"upscale\" restaurant in the US that treats it's customers so rudely... and serves it's butter in those cheapo little foil packets one sees at Denny's.",

    "text": "WARNING: COME HUNGRY!  If you think you're hungry, come hungrier. You can get filled so fast due to all the delicious meats you may scarf down in the first 30 mins (trust me, personal experience).   My boyfriend and I got seated fairly quickly upon walking in with no reservation. Our server hastily explained the process of the coasters to my boyfriend (first-timer). Red means no more meat, green means come at me with them (not kidding, they practically swarm you; can't think of any other heaven).   We quickly scurried to the salad bar to choose the different sides for the meats we were about to devour. I loved the range of selection, healthy and non-healthy. The veggies tasted very fresh. They also offered different vinaigrettes, oil, and condiments for our sides. Being Asian, we had rice our first round to eat with our meats but quickly changed it to all veggies (we're clearly new to this).  Now onto the food itself: Can I please just first talk about the mashed potatoes that they brought out as a side. They were the FLUFFIEST clouds of heaven I've ever tasted in my near 23 years of life. They practically melted in my mouth. I was so taken aback by the potatoes I immediately placed half of it on my own plate. The cheeseballs deserve a shoutout too. The cheese wasn't prominent visually but definitely evident tastefully. They were SO airy, it was just delightful. I loved tearing it in pieces and looking at the insides. I felt like a child eating those wonderful cheese balls. My favorite meats were the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the top sirloin. I liked that you can request particular meats and it will come out right away. I also like that they ask how you liked your meat cooked. Some meats came out a lot more rare than my requested medium rare, but it was still delicious.  The meat servers were pretty nice, some made jokes which was pleasant. The service speed can be a bit better. I had to ask a few times for my A1 sauce (I know I shouldn't ask for a sauce, but I can't resist A1 sauce no matter how good the meat is). We had to wait a bit for our cups to be refilled as well. This may be due to how busy they were so it's not a big deal.  All in all, this was a pleasant experience with a wonderful array of meats and vegetables to choose from. I will definitely be back to celebrate special occasions!",

Most of my personal preferences with restaurants revolve around what I believe most importantly being the services provided and of course great tasting food. I may have the best tasting food for example but if lousy service accompanies it, I will never return.  Enter Minh at Fogo, man this guy has all the bases covered! With a greeting and pleasant exchanges he knew what we were in Vegas for and in that restaurant to be exact among other things. Never had to look for him to flag him down to help us (my girlfriend and I)with anything. Very thorough in helping us understand Fogo culture and made us feel as if we were welcomed regulars. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought he was an owner or something.  Food was epic, price was unreal considering it is Vegas where some places can easily hover around the $400 price range for 2 people. Staff was great as well, but Minh really set the tone. My girlfriend and I will definitely return to Fogo when in Vegas. Hope this isn't over the top but something as sometimes forgotten help can be overlooked and we wanted to bring it to the forefront.  Hope you guys feel the same! Enjoy and thank you Minh!!!",

    "text": "Service Service Service ... the fifth star always comes down to excellent service.  Everyone that came by our table (from the ones filling our water glasses or clearing our plates, to the servers themselves) always made sure that we were happy & getting anything that we might need, or want.  The meats were tender and seasoned, tasting better than other places we've been. Each time we had our plates filled with several variations of flavorful morsels of meat, another walked by with some new item we hadn't seen before...driving us to eat what we had, so we could make room to have the \"new\" ones.  Multiple options of beef, lamb, chicken, and pork, made their dance around the room. The chicken leg was a surprise; juicy with a crispy seasoned outer layer.  The lamb guy saw how I lit up when he served me lamb chops, and made sure to stop by each trip from the kitchen...I usually obliged.  The roasted plantains were wonderful to take bites of between the different meats; refilled every time I polished off the previous offering. \"Yes, more please\" was all I could mumble each time I was asked.  At the conclusion of our meal, when asked how everything was, I made mention of their meats being so much tastier than that Texas place, and was invited to see their charcoal grill in the kitchen.  I was brought to the heart of their operation by Jose, a Customer Service (manager?), who showed me their charcoal \"grill\" with beef on one side and lower temp meats on the left, along with the sea salt they used and some other things...explaining how each server was responsible for keeping track of their meats with varying doneness in order to offer diners the types they preferred.  What a wonderful & unexpected treat to see.    Too full for dessert, I opted for a refreshing glass of their Brazilian Lemonade. I highly recommend it!  Tips: * pace yourself, there isn't a time limit * if you don't know, or can't remember, all their meat offerings, ask for a brochure * ask them about specialty drinks that aren't on the cocktail menu they hand you when you are seated * except for some sauces or vegetables, don't waste precious stomach room on the salad bar...it's all about the meat!",

    "text": "My husband and I made Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse our date night dinner location recently because he got tipped 2 free dinners by the location's manager. We made a reservation through their website and were seated right away when we showed up. From start to finish we received excellent service from then staff.  Since we had never eaten at a Brazilian Steakhouse, we were unfamiliar with how it works as we were expecting an menu with entrees to choose on. We were mistaken in the greatest way as its an all you can eat buffet/ Steakhouse for one very fair price per person, about $55.  When you arrive to your table you notice in the middle of the room there is a large circular buffet table with salads, cheese, Italian meats, and other various side dishes. Your server will then give you a two-sided card, colored green and red. Green tells the servers with various meats to approach your table to see if your interested and if so you let them know how you want it cooked (the sample has all the various types of temperature already prepared). If you want a specific type of meat you just let them know and it will be delivered to you. The staff are very knowledgeable, so I suggest getting their recommendations if you don't have a particular meat in mind. If you flip your card to red, the meat servers know not to approach you.  In our experience, within 30 seconds of flipping the card back to green, we had 4 different servers provide samples of mouth watering steaks! My personal favorite was the filet mignon!  So if you are planning a unique dining experience, I highly recommend Fogo De Chao! Word of advice, go starving since it's an all you can eat and try not filling up at the buffet table and getting in as many steak choices as possible.",

    "text": "Yes it is very fancy. You get a dining experience like no other because of people coming by to serve you meats you request, etc. the servers have to be very professional so yes you get that. But the salad bar wasn't anything special (this is the first thing you go through before actual food experience). When they bring us the meat, some are extremely amazing and some are just okay nothing special which is why I give this 4 stars. The service, the place, and some meats are amazing but it's overrated.   +++Oh but for dessert PLEASE get their creme brulee because wow it's good for two people and it is one of the best creme brulee's I've tasted.(so there's that!) :)",

All the meats were cooked to perfection and they have a very good wine list as well. I don't remember the wine my husband chose but it was equally fantastic. Service was also above and beyond. Each of our servers answered our questions and immediately brought what we wanted. Honestly, there is no reason to even visit the buffet for any of the sides, you're just going to want to have all the meats.  I will be visiting again!",

I didn't feel like I was in some pretentious joint and could relax and have a good time with my friends.  Even so the atmosphere is completely classy and is an easy choice for a meat-eater's date.    The food was excellent.  The salad bar was extensive with cheeses and veggie options. I did make the mistake of getting too much salad though... save yourself for the masterfully prepared meats!  The garlic steak was one of my favorites, along with the filet mignon.  Very juicy and tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The variety of meats and how they were seasoned and prepared was impressive as well.  The after thought makes my mouth water!  They always have two or three \"how done\" levels on the same serving of meat, and if they don't bring the level of doneness that you want they will immediately return to your table.  Come hungry, and leave over indulged!",

What stunned me about this location is the customer service attitude. I ordered a bottle of 2009 Spanish wine. The waiter brought the 2010 bottle and tried to open before I mentioned the year difference. He then claimed that they ran out of the 2009 and it was the same taste. When I challenge his thinking and asked it was a different price he insisted that it has to be the same price and asked me to pick something else if I don't like that!!!! That attitude in a good restaurant is a formula for disaster. Zero attention to customer service will make me not go there again. At least NO to that location.",

What I have heard is the food is very good.  Needless to say, we chose to eat here.  The place has an upscale look and feel as you enter.  We were greeted immediately and taken to a table.  The place was pretty busy for a Saturday night.  When the waiter came, we all ordered the standard bbq that comes out on large scewers.  After ordering, we went to a large buffet style area that offered tons of sides and compliments to the meat that was soon to come out.  Within a few minutes of getting back to the table, food begins to arrive.  Tons of great steaks and chicken.  All were delicious and they never sowed down on bringing itout until you flipped your card from green to red.  So for dinner and one mixed drink, it was $75 per person (including tip).  Well worth the price for what we got.  If you like the brazillian bbq type of eating or are curious to try it, be sure to come here and give it a try.  A+",

Salad bar with more selections I could remember, however I did have some lime-dressed-scallions/greens/tomatoes/something that blended well with the meats.  Notably, the smoked salmon was a bit too salty for my liking.   My favorite of the meats would be the parmesean pork and the lamb. I was never really a big fan of lamb, but this was soft and tender.   Water was never empty, service was top notch and I will have to remind myself to fast for a few days before coming here again :)",

Sometime flans are too eggy flavored.  But not here. Just smooth, firm, silky flan.    2. Molten lava cake.... normally, this would be #1 dessert on my list. At Fogo, the flan just edges out this classic melty, chocolatey, gooey, stick to your ribs, goodness on a plate.  3. Chocolate mousse...  layered mousse goodness. Its good but a distant 3rd.   3. key lime pie...  tied for 3rd. its good.  4. Creme brulee.  you would think that this would be as good as the flan but its just missing something that would elevate it.  sorry...I could only review five desserts.

I tend to find that Texas De Brazil's meat is too salty, but here at Fogo de Chao it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. And hands down they have the best cheese bread. They are light and cheesey and just bread perfection.  The salad bar also has a wide selection, comparable to the other places in town. Another stand out feature is that they have fried polenta as a side dish-.they were crispy little sticks of fried goodness. Tastes similar to a fried potato- just genius.",

The manager came to our table and talked with us for a while about what they do there and what they're trying to go for.

    "text": "Drove 8 hours away from home to for my mother's 70th blessed birthday celebration and chose Fogo's in Las Vegas. I had a party of 14. I picked a Brazilian restaurant for my mother's special day because I have been to the ones in San Francisco and a couple other's and have always been satisfied with customer service, the food I know from experience has always been great!  I went by this place according to yelp reviews to make sure my mom had a beautiful atmosphere. I regret coming to this place! The two lady clerks who checked us in were very rude when we walked in as if we were in the wrong place. I spoke to two different people the day before and the day of our reservation. They told me they would put my moms flower lei on the table as I specified, but when we arrived their the clerk lady handed me my moms flower lei that was delivered and asked me..\"What did you want us to do with this\"? I just took it and gave it to my mom and ignored the fact that it was already set up with the one I spoke with early that day. This is not a kid friendly place, my five year old niece accidentally slightly bumped into one of the waitresses and the waitress threw up her hands in disgust and grunted out loud, my five year old niece apologized with an \"excuse me sorry\"and the waitress looked at her as if she was a nuisance and rudely walked off shaking her head making my five year old niece feel bad. Customer service was horrible! When we started heading out towards the front it was sad to watch the same clerk as she walked off and sat at the bar as she waited until we left. As a Polynesian ethnic restaurant owner I would not ever treat my customers with rudeness know matter what color your skin was. Yes, I would definitely  recommend Fogo's to my friends and family, but I would  only recommend my Caucasian  friend's to the one in Las Vegas. Very disappointed to pay that much money to be treated with the unfriendly unwelcoming faces.   The 1 star is for Customer Service  They don't have a 5 stars for food only... I give 5 Stars for their food. I know good food when I eat, their food was awesome!!",

Even the buffet, while being not overwhelming has big and juicy veggies, prosciutto and a whole parmigiano reggiano cheese for you to dig! I never once had dessert with rodizio but at Fogo I had to try a dessert that I only had in brazil crema de mamao (spelling not sure) which is papaya blended with ice cream and some brazilan liquor in it, really good. The place was super packed and I can see why meats and service were top notch I will definitely be back soon. It is unfortunate for via brasil (which used to be my fav in town) and texas (not that great anyway) I will never go anywhere else for a brazilian meat feast. There is no comparison for the quality and the taste of the meat, while pretty much you get the same variety everywhere.",

My only question is why a Caribbean dish like fried plantains is on a Brazilian menu, but whatever, they were still delicious. Also, make sure to save room for the Picanha. It's the best!",

    "text": "Just left this restaurant after spending $1300+  and quite disappointed. We were there with a party of 15 celebrating a birthday. The meat rounds were  great but the waitress lacked attention to our table. When we ordered the last round of drinks, one of the drinks brought to us was incorrect. The waitress didnt  offer to take it back to the bar to have it corrected so we just decided to keep it.  2 other drinks didn't have sugar on the rims of the glasses like described in the menu. When asked the waitress why, she said the bar had already dumped out the sugar since it was close to closing time. Really?? I'm sure with the amount of money paid to this restaurant they could've afforded to open up another sugar tray for our drinks. Guess not! 15 people and over a thousand dollars for this type of service, definitely not worth it. The food was amazing but the easiest part, the service, could have been at least decent. Not impressed at all.",

You can start off at a salad bar which is pretty good. I loved the smoked salmon, bacon, and charcuterie. Next was the system of red and green signals. They give each person a two sided placard. If flipped on green, meat carvers walking around will know you want some. If red, they will not bother your dining. All the meats were so wonderfully seasoned and grilled. My favorite was the bottom sirloin and the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. Also, the caramelized bananas with condensed milk was absolute mind-blowing!",

The price is also cheaper than the one in LA ($26-27 vs. $34-35 for lunch). The servers are very attentive, the side dishes are replenished constantly without being requested so we could have it fresh and hot all the time. The waiter even put on my bracelet for me without being asked after seeing me struggled a little trying to put it on myself. He also picked up and return the money that I dropped on the floor. Awesome place to be and .... oh I forgot about dessert, the flan is like giving you an orgasm in your mouth!!! And the best part was getting a tour to the back kitchen to see behind the scene action of the meat skewers mingle with the fire. Definitely coming back here on our next trip to Vegas!!!",

The wait staff is just awesdome and they make the whole dinning experience a treasure to be had, The salad bar is a notch above as is all the meat. The only problem you will have when you go there is running out of room before your taste bud want to stop. Going for lunch is less expensive and at dinner time. I highly recommend it for the really special occasion or when you want to impress someone. Great place for a business lunch. This is the only Brazilian BBQ in town worth going to.

Well, quickly after tasting our first bite of meat, we realized we had basically just paid $50 for an all-you-can-eat salad bar and some disgustingly, overlooked and under seasoned meat. It didn't matter how you wanted your meat cooked, it was all the same. Medium-rare=cooked thoroughly??  Really?  Yuck. I could go on and on about our meat samples that all tasted like a boot, but won't bore you. To top our visit off, when asked how our meal was, we were honest. Our server told us he was sorry, but that we should have thought about it when we made out reservation for the busy time of night. Basically implying that quality goes down during that time. He told us the meat gets cooked and then sits on the grill/burner to stay hot all day. Yuck. What a HUGE disappointment, and not a cheap one at that.",

Fogo has enough types of meat that I don't think I was served the same thing twice. My favorite was the bacon wrapped sirloin. Keep your coaster on green if you want to be served, flip it over to the red side if you need a short break to digest :)  The bathroom smelled like sewage and the staff were rude.

You can tell this is not a well kept secret... It was early on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy, but nothing was compromised in terms of food or service. By the way, the cheesy bread is killer!! The customer service rep (Ricardo) took extra special attention with us to make sure everything was perfect!  He offered great advice and gave us excellent information about the restaurant.

    "text": "This was my first experience with a Churrascaria type restaurant. The decor is nice, calming, and the aura is relaxed at this restaurant. You help yourself to the salad bar, which consists of salads, meats (including an awesome candied bacon), cheeses, fruits, veggies, soup, rice, etc). You will get a basket of interesting and tasty rolls at your table as well as mashed potatoes (typical. Nothing special) and something that resembles bananas foster (without the syrup-like topping). When you return to your table, you can choose when you're ready to receive meat! As soon as you turn the coin from red to green, you'll be presented with cuts of meat.  Our waiter was a little absent, which I thought odd because all they do is refill drinks and clear plates. The chefs are attentive, though; whenever our chip was Green-side up, we were inundated with options. I LOVE that we were offered a cut of meat, but then also a choice of how we wanted it cooked (example: there's 3 cuts of sirloin on a skewer and one is medium, one is med-rare, one is rare). They slice a little and you use your personal mini-tongs to grab it!   The meats were all pretty tasty. My favorite was definitely the house sirloin. The lamb was my least favorite, which is surprising because I typically like lamb a lot. This tasted like it had been cross-contaminated with a seafood product, though.  Adults cost approximately $52 for dinner and it includes everything I've described. Desserts, drinks, etc are extra. We did share a creme brulee which was around $9 and it was pretty good. It didn't blow my socks off, bit it was exactly what I wanted (and expected).  All in, I'd give this place another go if I were in a city that had one and I was celebrating something. I think it's a cool experience (Churrascaria restaurant, that is) but it's not something I'd pressure you to do.",

We went to the salad bar and I loved it so much I had to go back again. Their potato salad is perfect, the chicken Caesar salad was amazing, and my favorite was the tabbouleh. I'm middle eastern so I was really excited about the tabbouleh. It tasted just like my moms! The meats were so delicious and each of them had a different but perfect taste. All of the were juicy too! I can't really list them because I tried about 10 different kinds. We tried the creme brulee. It was so delicious! It came with blueberries on there and if you include the blueberry with the pudding, it makes it so much better. At the end of our meal, when we paid for everything, they gave us a card for a free meal (lunch or dinner!) I can't wait to go back soon!",

The waitress came up promptly and took our drink order. About 15 minutes passed and no sides had been brought out yet (mashed potatoes,bread and bananas). They were busy so was understandable. We asked the server and they were brought out about 10 minutes later. That's the last time we seen our server. No additional drink orders could be made and or side orders. We waited approximately 20 minutes for someone (not the server) to come around and ask if we were done and another 10 minutes or so to get the bill.  There were long periods of time that we could not see one Gaucho walking around with meat to serve. Very unpleasant experience. We always tip, however, on this night we did not. We will not return and will instead go to Texas De Brazil, as we have never had this experience there.",

    "text": "Holy meaty deliciousness. I can't believe I've waited so long to try this place. It blows away any other Brazilian steakhouse.   Let's start with the salad bar. There's a make your own Caesar Salad with Parmigiano Reggiano, you can have it shredded or grated. I went with both. It was so good.   Some other options on the salad bar that I really liked, full artichoke bottoms, Peppadew peppers, Aged Manchego Cheese, Baby Swiss Cheese and marinated mushrooms. I tried to limit the salad bar to one small plate to safe room for the good stuff.   I almost missed the bread on the table. I'm not sure how something so small can be so yummy. It just looks like a little biscuit, but you definitely have to try it. Somehow it basically melts in your mouth leaving hints of cheesy, buttery bread deliciousness floating all over your tongue. Make sure to eat them while they are hot.   Side dishes: The fried polenta was actually really good. I've never had it before, but somehow I'm positive that no other place will make them this good. Garlic mashed was also pretty good, as were the caramelized bananas.   The Meats:   Top Sirloin (Picanha) very tasty. I preferred the garlic seasoned version, but both were good.   Ribeye (Beef Ancho) My favorite of the meats... It's just so delicious. It seriously melts in your mouth. The flavor dances all over your tongue. I can't even explain it.   Lamb (Cordeiro) The lamb was very tender and had a very subtle flavor.   Flank Steak (Fraldinha - Bottom Sirloin) I think  2nd favorite. It was so tender and seasoned perfectly.   Each cut of meat is more delicious than the last. This place is so good. To top of the dinner we ordered the Flan. It was drenched in creamy caramel and whipped cream. It was exquisite.   The service here is absolutely superb. My water was never empty. The minute you flip your card over to show that you would like a new selection of meat, one of the carvers is by your side. Our server made sure we always had fresh bread and replenished our sides as needed. I felt like everyone in the place was concentrated on making sure I had everything. Next time I go back I'd like to try the Filet and the beef ribs.",

Along with the wide variety of meats they serve three side dishes that consist of mashed potatoes, polenta and plantains.  They also serve warm cheese bread to go with your meal.  The polenta and cheese bread are to die for.  Servers are always attentive and replace sides and cheese bread as needed or.  The meat is succulent, cooked really appropriately.  There were times I felt the seasoning was a little off, but I am known to be a salt freak.    The way it works:  They have you start with the salad bar.... Resist the urge, there's so many yummy meats you will want to eat.  If you must, there is a wide variety of veggies, cheeses and other anti pasto to choose from (keep this light).    When ready for meat service, simply flip your green/red card green and servers will immediately bring you your sides, and new plates for your meats.  As long as your card is green the meat servers will stop by your table and offer you meat - use the provided tongs to grab meat.",

The pudim is indeed excellent, as Marcel says, and while it may not meet his standards for rodizio, again, it's way better than the other options in town.

Their sausage is terrible.  Avoid!  But, I must repeat, their beef is pretty much perfection.  You can pay $50 for a steak on the strip or eat as much ribeye, fillet and amazing sirloin as you want here.  You MUST get reservations if you're going on a weekend night.  We did, luckily.  They were saying a 3-hour wait to folks who had cabbed it from the Strip.  Ugh.  We walked right in and sat down.  I kinda felt bad.  Oh, the salad bar?  Texas de Brazil totally wins that one.  Sometimes we go there just for that.  But, if you're in it for MEAT, this is the place.  You won't be disappointed.",

Cured meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, soups, and different salads are all present. Buffalo mozzarella and manchego cheese are two of my personal favorites.   The waiters provide you with an extensive spit-roasted meat selection, perfectly seasoned. While I do not eat red meat, the chicken and pork were cooked to perfection and even the flank steak was good. The garlic sirloin is the best meat there.   The waitstaff were professional, polite, and attentive to customers. Our glasses were never empty, and the manager came over twice to ensure our experience was top-notch. He also did not charge for my children (all 3 of them) which was surprising and very appreciated!",

You begin with a salad bar that has enough veggies, fruits, meats, and cheeses to squash your appetite, but don't fill up your plate here because the good stuff is yet to come. I limit myself to a small salad with some mozzarella and manchego cheese. Once you return to your seat, you flip over a card to the green side to indicate you're ready for the proteins, at which point a parade of meat-wielding servers entice you with a variety of selections and cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb that they methodically slice from a skewer on to your plate. When you've had enough, you flip your card back over to red. They also bring mashed potatoes, polenta, caramelized bananas, and these delicious, cheesy dinner rolls, which I just learned are gluten-free. I have been to the Indianapolis location many times and recalled the potatoes and polenta being better than what I had most recently in Las Vegas. The potatoes had no flavor and the polenta tasted like it had sat out for a couple hours before arriving at our table. One other issue I had was that I requested the bacon-wrapped filet mignon four (4) times - count 'em! - before someone finally came around with 3 small pieces for our group of 30 and well after I'd finished everything else on my plate. I get that it's a popular cut, but we spent several thousand dollars that evening so I don't know why they were being stingy with it. The chocolate mousse cake was excellent. All-in-all, it's a 4 star experience and a bit on the pricey side so make sure you go in hungry.",

I thought it pricey for what I got. A guest and I were seated at this tiny table in the middle near the salad bar, which was kind of awkward and exposed. The manager stopped by and was very kind. Service was very attentive.   It is better than Texas de Brazil in one regard. It's not quite as noisy.   A good meal. Still on balance I'm not planning on making this a special occasion place, which at this price is what it wants to be. So many other great places in this area.",

    "text": "Just from a vegetarian perspective. They do have a salad bar if you happen to be with a bunch of people who need to eat meat. The salad bar here is probably just as good as any buffet in Vegas. Not that impressive. I have been to a place similar to this in San Jose that had a fantastic salad bar this one, meh. Rice dry and over salty potato salad that was probably purchased from a grocery store pre packaged section.  I will state the apple salad and cheese was good.  Also my meat eating friends were distressed to find out grilled pineapple wasn't a choice. Once again, the Brazilian meat place that we went to in San Jose had it. Also my meat eating friends were sad that the lamb was too salty. When manager was asked she stated that grilled pineapple wasn't authentic. But their dessert menu included NY cheese cake and flan. Some pretty 'authentic' choices eh?  Also note the coffee is good.",

If you've never been to a traditional Brazilian Rodizio, you have to try this place.  Start with the excellent fresh salad bar - virtually everything you can imagine, fresh vegetables, cheese, proschiutto. The main course is all you can eat grilled meats on skewers sliced right at your table - 12 different kinds.  The meats here are succulent and grilled to perfection. The meats include several cuts of beef, chicken, sausage, pork and lamb.  You must try the Picanha - Brazilian style prime sirloin. For sides there are wonderful plantains and potatoes.  You will not go home hungry.",

As promised, returned to Fogo de Chao to have a New Year's Eve Dinner with friends.   When we walked in, we were greeted by three hostesses, and I thought it would be a busy night.  I really liked the nice open dining area which is something I always noticed when I walked into the restaurant.  The moment our seated, the waitstaff brought us a small basket of warm puffy biscuit that tasted like cheddar cheese, yumm! We all wanted to drink a good red wine and the waiter recommended several easy & smooth taste of wine that we should try out for the evening.  We decided to try a bottle of \"La Creama Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast\". It was absolutely delicious-great balance & full of fruit :).  After ordering our wine, we all started with going to the unlimited salad bar to start with something light.  The salad bar here is actually simple and decent-a various kinds of cheese, vegetable, and salads.  Well, I really appreciate the fact that they kept it simple.  Anyways, I am here at the restaurant to have all different section of meats! I have tried everything except the Lamb and Chicken Heart.  I really enjoyed having a Pork Sausage, Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Flank Steak, Prime Rib, and Garlic Sirloin.  The skewer of meat kept coming to our table.  I don't remember how many times I turned my \"Green Dial (which means KEEP THE ENDLESS MEAT COMING, PLZ)\" on the table. We finished our meal with sharing a plate of dessert, FLAN!  Oh my goodness, the texture of the pudding custard was something different than what I usually had it before.  I was very fond of the FLAN :) :)  It's a great place to have a nice meal for a special occasion and I would suggest going for lunch since it's less expensive.   But, definitely worth the splurge...  I'm sure I'll be back. And it is good to have some cash in your purse because I was asked to valet on both trips to the restaurant.   Don't forget to finish off your meal with a mouth-watering dessert, Flan :-9   FLAN  People........, F L A N !!!",

We have a couple of Brazilian restaurants like this in Seattle so we knew what to expect but at the same time, we were excited to see what different meats there would be at this location.  The food was amazing, the service was plentiful and Ricardo Pinto was great!  They were well staffed so anytime we had a question, it was easy to find someone to answer it.  The meats were never-ending, constantly juicy and well cooked, and even their \"salad/cheese bar\" had so much to offer!  More than anything, I fell in love with their house-made cheese bread.  Warm, bite-sized, yummy.  I would definitely come back for more!",

The restaurant is more about it's gaucho theme than anything else. And it uses a marketing technique to get you to over-indulge at the salad bar and/or fill up on cheese bread before the skewers begin arriving. You'll also find that the premium skewers can be hard to find. The guys with the cheaper meat cuts visit you more often. Saying no to the cheaper guys -- waiting for the better stuff -- will get you a visit from an assistant manager who will ask you what is wrong. Being truly selective about what you want is frowned upon? $85? Not for me.",

Understand that when you go to Fogo the servers work as a team. They all ensure that even your water glass stays full. They treat you like royalty. With an extensive wine list, cocktails that make you crave more on top of the delicious cuts of meat, you wish you could make this place your home. You cannot take any meat to-go, not that you'd need to, but you can take dessert. You do not want to miss out on this part. Creme brulee and the flan are the best. This is where I take friends when they come into town. Buffets on the strip, especially for the price, are nothing compared to Fogo. They also set themselves apart from their counterpart, Texas de Brazil. If you go to Texas de Brazil for lunch they cut out the good cuts of meat, not Fogo. It is the same meal for both lunch or dinner. I make this at least a monthly meal for my wife and I.",

We had reservations and waiting very little for our table. Our server asked if we were familiar with the concept. After stating yes, he says \"well, good, so I don't have to go on and on about what we have to offer\" Ummm, okay, thank you? Drink orders placed, our party of 4 gets up to peruse to the cold selections. We get back to the table, still no drinks. About half-way through eating the plate of cold selections our drinks show up. The server also brings some of their hot cheesy bread. I think this was the highlight of the evening. Once we turned our discs to green the meat was slow to arrive. Very slow. We actually had to ask for meat. Repeatedly. There seemed to have been a restriction on serving sizes. I would not recommend this location.",

    "text": "You can't go wrong at Fogo, Texas, or Via Brazil.  All 3 are very nicely decorated, staff is properly trained, and food is as good as it gets.  This was my first attempt at Fogo and here is what I discovered.  The salad bar is fresh and the choices are similar to Texas, however the Italian dressing tastes identical to a bottle of Kraft that you can buy at Smith's.  Not very unique like the balsamic dressing at Texas.  Nothing is labeled either.  It's kind of obvious as to what each item is such as lettuce, cheese, whatever but I still like to see the titles of each item being served.  No sushi, no lobster bisque, no soup at all at Fogo. This is where I give the top honors to Texas for their salad bar.  Onto the meats... I read a reviewer state the top sirloin was NOT the best meat at Fogo.  I found that hard to believe and after experiencing for myself, he was right.  But the thing is at Fogo, they call about 3 different looking meats \"top sirloin\".  One was the obvious one that looks kind of heart shaped with mild fat on the outside.  Another big chunk of meat was also called top sirloin.  It looked and tasted like Via Brazil's prime rib. Fogo's garlic sirloin was the best of the 3 places.  I must give the best meat award to Via.   Side dishes are minor but I liked Texas and Via's banana's, rice better than Fogo. Restroom was tiny.  Men's had only 2 toilets and 2 urinals.  Texas has a much better restroom facility.  Overall verdict.... me and a friend gave top overall to Via because of their super tasting meats.  Texas has the best salad bar but we are not there for greens.",

We waited at the bar for about 30 minutes for our table, meanwhile we had some of their specialty cocktails. I had their mule and my wife had their fruity lemonade cocktail, both were really good and refreshing. We got to our table , our server seemed pretty professional but didn't take the time to explain how their system worked (I had to assume based on another Brazilian steakhouse I went to) we went to the salad bar and I was not impressed. Everything was ok tasting and seemed fresh but I expected more variety. We then flipped our card to green ready for some meat ! Everything was just \"ok\" nothing spectacular. Our server disappeared and was replaced with some lady who was actually more social. They gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary which was unexpected but awesome !",

    "text": "It's rare for me to hand out 5 stars, but Fogo de Chao totally deserves 5 stars from start to finish.    As we walked up to the front door, we were greeted with a friendly welcome by a gentleman holding the door.  The hostess greeted us with a smile and a cheerful welcome.  Food was scrumptious, service was very attentive ~ what more could you ask for?!?  The only complaint was that we were so full that none of us had room for dessert.  Cheesecake, Chocolate Molten Cake, Creme Brulee and more.  We met up with a friend who wanted to have dinner at a nice steakhouse.  Of course, we turned to Yelp, our trusty source for great places to dine.   Fogo de Chao came up on the radar.  We were a little disappointed when we went to their website and noticed that the dress attire was dressy.  Hubby had not packed for the occasion.      We continued our search on Yelp for other suggestions, but kept coming back to Fogo de Chao.  We even thought about going out and purchasing a pair of slacks.  Finally hubby suggested I call the restaurant and see how strict the dress attire was given the 100 plus degrees temperature.  We were advised that shorts and a shirt were acceptable and reservations were recommended.  Hurray....we made plans for dinner and looked forward to the evening.  (on a side note, I read where a reviewer dinged the restaurant for allowing casusal attire.  I for one was very appreciative that the restaurant made an allowance)  We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, but were seated immediately.  Once we were seated, our waiter came to take our drink orders and explain how  dinner would progress.  Part I, start with the salad bar plus your choice of rice, beans and potatoes.  Part II, turn your disc to green to let the Gaucho chefs know you are ready to begin your meal.  Turn the disc to red when you want a break.  Our waiter suggested alternating so that you had a chance to enjoy your selections while they were hot.  I can't remember how many selections they offered that evening.  (I lost track, but more on that later)  The salad bar was amazing.  Why you say?  The greens were fresh and crisp.  (nothing worse then a soggy salad) Not only do they have the normal offerings that you find at  allsalad bars, the selection also included marinated shitake mushrooms, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, asparagus spears, strips of bacon (not itty bitty bacon bits) and more!  Our selection of meats for the evening included Picanha (house specialty), filet mignon, rib eye, top sirloin, lamb chops, lamb t-bone, chicken, linguica sausage, pork ribs.  It seemed like there were many more offerings, but these are the ones that I can remember.  The meats were seasoned to perfection.  The Gaucho chefs  would ask how you liked your meat.  Rare, medium rare, medium ~ for the most part, the meat was cooked to perfection.  Our favorites included the Picanha, filet mignon, lamb t-bone and lamb chops.  All dinners are served with sides of fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains. OMG! I almost forgot the cheese rolls.  These are little puffs of soft cheesy bread that melt in your mouth. You can easily fill up on these, but you'll be sorry if you do.   Service was outstanding.  The servers were very attentive.  If the Gaucho chefs  did not have the selection of your choice, they would make sure someone would be around with your choice shortly.    Like I mentioned early on in my review, my only complaint is that I didn't have room for dessert.  I will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas.",
