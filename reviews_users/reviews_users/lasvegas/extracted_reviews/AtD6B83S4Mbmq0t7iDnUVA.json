The most amazing part is that its all vegan. Not a single piece of meat. Im not a vegetarian myself but its very astonishing how they are able to give all the veggy meat that real texture. Plus its a great environment for everyone. Either as a date or the whole family.",

Since going vegan, I've missed many of the traditional Chinese dishes I used to enjoy, and eating here today brought back a wave of nostalgia. The food was SO GOOD and so authentic that my tastebuds were tingling with memories of childhood. I'm usually not a big fan of fake meat but I was actually in awe of how precisely they were able to mimic the textures and flavors of the various meats. I went with my mom who, as an asian parent, sometimes disapproves of my not eating meat and is aways super skeptical about fake meat, and even she thought the food was amazing. We ordered enough to take home half and ended up eating it all; even the waitress was surprised. If you're still reading, I'm pleading you to do yourself a favor and come here. Honestly, I might return to Vegas just to try the dishes I didn't get the chance to try this time around.",

This is an all vegetarian restaurant with a lot of variety on the menu. There is mock duck, chicken, beef, pork as well as the traditional tofu dishes.

We came here to try something different and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty it actually turned out to be. The atmosphere is very clean, green and zen like.   Service was great! The older Asian ladies were all very nice and even wrapped up our leftovers for us!   Hot and Sour soup (bowl)- was nice and spicy but was a bit bland.. Nothing a little low sodium soy sauce won't fix. \"Beef\" & Chinese broccoli- They didn't have it on the menu but were willing to make it for us.. Tastes pretty much just like the real thing!!! Sizzling \"Chicken\" and Veggies- This was my fav dish of the day. Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms made the dish especially yummy! Brown Rice: At no extra charge and is included with entrees!!!  The fake meat looked just like real meat and tastes pretty darn similar. I think the texture is what gives it away. The texture is very similar to that of Inari (tofu wrap used at sushi places..) None the less, this place should definitely be bookmarked and is a great healthier alternative to the real stuff!",

Geez.. But there's no need to fear, Veggie House is here!   I've tried a variety of dishes here and I've yet to be disappointed; Pan-Fried Noodles, Mongolian Beef, Wonton Soup, Beef Ramen, Sweet and Soup Chicken, Jasmine tea, BUN ROLL!! You need to order a fried bun roll.. Thank me later.  This place is vegan/vegetarian and they serve no meat.. What? Yes. I tell my bestie every single time that they should put quotes around all their meat products so people don't get so darn confused. Their meat, it's not real- but trust me, it's a good thing. Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the \"meat\" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can't do textures, you're probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.  All the food I've had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don't let that deter you.   Get the bun roll.  I'm serious.",

There are soooo many fake weird meats on the menu that I want to go back just to see some of this stuff.  Fake duck?  Fake shrimp?? Fake porkchop??? Fake beef?? Fake fish??  So weird.   We had vegetable fried wontons...delicious!!!   Husband had sizzling chicken.  He ate about half of it and then started complaining that he wanted to go to Smashburger on the way home and get something else to eat.  But he ended up taking the leftovers for lunch the next day and letting his friends try the fake chicken.  What a novelty!   I had what was supposed to be house lo mein.  What came out was a pile of ramen noodles on a plate with fake chicken, fake shrimp, and veggies.  It was hot and the veggies were really good. I've never had lo mein where things are just dumped on top of the noodles...usually it's mixed in?  It cost me and my husband almost $40 to eat here so I probably won't go back but it was fun to try. I felt good after the meal. Ya know how sometimes you eat somewhere and you just hate yourself afterwards?  I didn't get that feeling.",

    "text": "Gotta love Groupon! I doubt I would have bothered going here without seeing it on the deal site. There are so many Asian Veg places where we're from that when in Vegas, it's probably the last cuisine that I'm looking to eat.  While we have a \"house of veggies\" (two, I believe) in The Bay Area, it's nothing like what they have here in Vegas. Bay Area Vegetarian House = Mostly Vietnamese style food, served with a side of Supreme Master aura. LV Veggie House = Mostly Chinese inspired dishes, served with a Buddhist aura in a tranquil environment, just a short drive from the bustling activity of The Strip.  They really thought out every nook and cranny of the details to their interior decorations. It's nothing fancy, some of it kinda cheesy, yet it all flows together so naturally. I got a kick out of listening to the water fall from the top of the corrugated plastic roof of one of the gazebos.  The waitresses were great. One gal even rearranged our table in a fit of feng shui (or OCD). It's good that they're easy to talk to since the menu descriptions were quite vague or nonexistent at all.  I'm a fan of the Genreral Tso, so that is one of the first things we ordered. Theirs was done as well as any that I've had. Same with the Orange Chicknon. Crispy with a nice tangy sauce. The General coulda been spicier but that's what the house made chili sauce is for.  The dish that truly stood out for me was the Pan Fried Noodle. My coworkers often order this when we go out to eat at non-veg restaurants. After one bite, I can see why. The noodles were crunchy, while the flavorful, thick sauce moistened things up and added an extra layer of flavor.  They have a Curry Roti that was delicious as well. It reminds me of the light, flaky roti that I used to love before I returned to being Vegan. Get two orders of this or you'll be fighting over who gets the last bite.  Even though we were stuffed, my babygirl was drooling over the dessert menu. We went with the fried 'naner and ice cream. So good! They had several ice cream flavors but they were out of most of them so we went with classic vanilla.  You can tell that Chef Kenny puts a lot of love into his food. He'll come out to greet the dinner guests and chat for a bit before disappearing into the kitchen. He just wants to be sure everyone is enjoying the food.  I could spend my entire Vegas vacation in Chinatown. Partly because of Veggie House. They make being Vegan in Vegas a breeze. They do have egg in some items, but if you tell the waitresses that you're Vegan, you'll have no worries.     For a more complete rundown of all the dishes that we ordered, see this Hot Stuff's review: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/veggie-house-las-vegas-4?hrid=t4jLm0i_cyZUwP4KQlTzbQ\">yelp.com/biz/veggie-hous...</a>",

Since I was meeting my son who is vegan in Las Vegas I searched for a restaurant which could accommodate his food preferences.  After reading the reviews of Veggie House we thought we would give it a try.  Boy was I surprised.   Tasty soup, appetizers and main courses.  Friendly efficient service. Lack of ambience.  It was amazing.  In particular I ordered the lo mein which had \"chicken\" and \"shrimp\" along with vegetables- maybe a little under seasoned but with a touch of soy sauce it was great.   I am no longer a vegan sceptic   It's a 10 minute bus ride from the strip if you're a tourist.  Most of the patrons were locals so it's a spot for all",

Honestly, you put their dishes next to the real thing and do a blind taste test and you'd certainly have trouble.  I only tried a few dishes but each was very good.  I had to try the kung pao chicken as I hear many people really enjoy that.  I also wanted tot try to the vegan bbq appetizer as I'm a big char siu fan.  To begin, the kung pao was your typical dish with zucchini, peanuts, peppers, and their rendition of chicken.  I thought it could have had more spice, but overall the portion size was solid and the dish had a good taste.  The bbq pork didn't quite have the strong tast of a char siu, but it was pretty close, especially in Vegas where it's very hard to find a quality bbq Chinese pork.  The prices were maybe a $1 or $2 higher than other take out Chinese, but the uniqueness and selection was great and I believe worth the extra few bucks.  They have a vegan burger joint opening up as well, so I will surely come back to Veggie House and try their beef and fish dishes and also try Vegeway when it opens in late September 2016.",

The food is still okay, however the staff is no longer as friendly as they once were. I placed an order online and had to wait an extra 30 mins in the restaurant... they said they received it, but essentially cooked the food to order in the restaurant. I will be exclusively be going to Chef Kenny's in the future, as most of the pleasantness I once enjoyed here has migrated over to the new restaurant. If you are looking for some vegan eats, go down the road to Chef Kenny's. After all he did create the menu here, and there are more options over at his new restaurant.",

Everyone is always very welcoming and hospitable. I've had the orange chicken, spring rolls, and pad Thai and all are super bomb! Only complain is that I had take out order for the pad Thai and I said no chicken or tofu just vegetables but I still got a few pieces of tofu. It's ok though because it complimented it nicely since I got it pretty spicy lol. Go check out veggie house!!",

    "text": "Was feeling under the weather so I headed into Chinatown to buy some ginkgo. The first supermarket I saw was in this complex so I was happy to see that Veggie House was right above it.   Ordered the oyster mushrooms with lemon grass sauce, spicy veggie crispy beef and Buddha Delight. I was with my Jewish boyfriend so it was nice to be at an Asian place where he could actually choose anything off the menu. He loved the coconut juice he ordered!  The chef came out to explain some of the dishes to my boyfriend because he had a hard time understanding how veggie meat is a thing, which was nice. The crispy beef is really nice and crispy with a nice mild heat, the oyster mushrooms were inhaled and all those veggies were just the thing to get me feeling a lot better. Food came with small servings of white rice (but you can pick brown) and we did not get through it all. If you are not much of an eater a portion is enough per person.   I ordered the strawberry cheesecake for dessert and was pleasantly surprised to see it was a douhua style confection. Yummy tofu pudding!  Great friendly service and fun kitsch ambience!",

    "text": "We ordered 2 dishes:  Eggplant and tofu and the shrimp with walnut sauce, both with brown rice.   The eggplant and tofu dish was outstanding.   I loved the hints of Thai basil and ginger--could have used even more of both.   We asked for it spicy (5 out of 10), but it arrived without heat.   The waitress kindly brought a small dish of chili pepper sauce.   There was really enough for 2 on this $10 entree.    Now for the shrimp with walnut sauce, which was surprisingly horrible.   The shrimp itself was probably OK, but it was slathered up with soy mayonnaise.   It was visually unappealing as well.   We asked Chef Kenny about the sauce and he returned moments later proudly holding a jar of store bought soy mayonnaise.    This is one short cut that should have been avoided.   Chef Kenny--please rethink this dish.   It would have been a winner if you had 3 dipping sauces for the shrimp.   Perhaps a sriracha sauce (siracha blended with soy mayo), a curry sauce, or a cilantro sauce.  Email me and we can work on this together.  I can visualize this dish with 3 little dipping bowls on the plate with a little cilantro or basil garnish.   Clean, colorful, simple, and gives the customer the choice of condiments.  Oh, enter the restaurant from the front which faces Spring Mountain Rd.   Just go up the stairs and look for Suite 203 in the corner in the middle of the mall.   If you park around back, you will miss the beautiful entry way.      I'll definitely return for more of the savory-type entrees and see if I can change my rating to 5 stars.",

    "text": "We love veggie house! I have now visited this place at least 5 times and they have never failed. Some dishes in my opinion, are better than others, but I think the trick is figuring out what you like. Veggie house is a very cute restaurant with a small pond, gazebo, and twinkle lights all in one place. The servers are always very sweet and have not trouble understanding English. They are also patient when my friends and I roll in with 5-7 children as well as accomodating to their needs (forks, smaller water cups, removal of hot tea glasses, etc). Now, let's get to the good stuff.  The spicy crispy eggplant is seriously as good as everyone says. They're like slightly more fiberous (and nutritionally rich) variation of french fries tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. They are crispy and the flavors are out of this world. We get this every time, but I recommend that this is not ordered to go as they will obviously lose their crisp texture. We get this as an appetizer because everyone just grabs heaping loads onto their plate and is a fantastic appetite-teaser. Their roti with chicken curry is also amazing! We tried it for the first time two days ago and had to put in a second order because the kids couldn't get enough. Even though I make roti (the frozen variation) at home, it had nothing on the light and puffed up roti that was served with that perfect curry.   My favorite entree is probably the eggplant with tofu because it has thai basil in it! I love basil, so I am unfairly biased to any dish that has basil in it, but this dish is fantastic. The tofu in it is somehow better than in other dishes. A definite winner. Another awesome dish is the braised tofu with veggies because of the HUGE assortment of veggies that come with it. Everything from bok choy, to snap peas, to mushrooms can all be found alongside the braised tofu. My kids of course love the chow fun because what kid doesn't love noodles? The texture and the abundance of veggies is what I dream of from other restaurants.   While I do cook with a lot of \"fake meat\" at home, I am not a fan of some of the fake meat items from here. Even my husband, who loves his animal products suggests that we go sans-fake-meat because he prefers the vegetable dishes here. The texture of some of the chicken (orange chicken, simmering beef plate) dishes are very strange. They're made from a chinese vegetable with a lot of different layers and are kind of tough and chewy compared to real chicken, but the chicken inside the curry chicken was nothing like this. I don't know how they determine which type of \"fake meat\" to use for which dish, but I say try them all and see what you like.   Lastly, they have vegan ice cream here and the cherry chocolate chip is on point!! My friends ordered the cherry chip while I got the green tea, and I was envious after I tried theirs that I was stuck with the green tea. Don't pass up the vegan ice cream, or the 10% Yelp check-in offer that they're currently offering. Come one come all for those that are looking to add a little extra veggies to their diet. I promise they'll come in a tasty way.",

    "text": "Chickn curry with potato lunch special is amazing!!! If you have tried and loved the roti with curry appetizer, you will loveee this dish!!! It is loaded with veggies and very good faux chicken.  It is a yellow curry, more like an indian yellow curry than a thai curry.  if you are sensitive to spicy foods it might be a bit much, but for me it was just the right amount of heat.  The Brown rice here is the best brown rice ive ever had...idk what other rices they use but its got a few dif grains in it that all come together so perfectly.  Tofu soup that comes with the lunch special is simple but flavorful.  For $8 it is a great value...I brought half my plate home!   Other dishes I have tried:  *general tzos chicken: 5 stars (tastes EXACTLY like \"regular\" general tzos *roti with curry: 5 stars *crispy spicy eggplant: 3 stars (this is a highly praised dish, but I personally didn't like it as much as some people seem to. I think It is pretty good as a side, just not extraordinary as a main dish) *spicy crispy beef: 3 stars. (Another highly praised dish, but again not one of my faves. Not very convincing \"beef\"...to thin and crispy...reminded me almost like fried pork skins...but not as hard/crispy as pork skin so just kind of a confusing texture for me.  It was flavorful, and would be amazing on a bahn mi! *orange chicken: 2 stars. (Tasted more like sweet and sour than orange. Very vinegary sauce) *sweet and sour pork: 3 stars. (Loved the \"pork\" texture) *fried dumplings: 3 stars (would have been 5 stars, but the ones i got were overdone.  Very tasty inside tho) *shrimp and broccoli: 4 stars (One of the \"plainer\" dishes.  No overly rich sauces, but it still has good flavor to it. it tastes very similar to shrimp with broccoli from a regular Chinese place.  A lot of the dishes here would fool meat eaters.   It is a great place for vegans and omnis to eat together. Can't wait for the ched to open his fast food restaurant to open in sept!!! (Featuring burgers and fish tacos and milkshakes and more!)",

    "text": "I know this review will mainly appeal to vegetarians but don't ignore it all you non-vegetarians!  Consider a veg restaurant part of your adventurous Yelp eating!  Is fake chicken really that different from cow guts?  Well yes, but..... what I'm saying is: don't be afraid to try it!  Chinatown isn't exactly the easiest place for vegetarians to visit - a menu can be daunting enough as it is, but then to throw in the question \"is there any (chicken stock/fish sauce/bonito flakes/meat bits) in this dish?\" and be prepared to blow some minds, including your own.  I don't enjoy blowing minds so sadly I don't visit many places in Chinatown.  But hey!  Don't fret, vegetable lovers!  Veggie House is awesome and will fill your Asian-food cravings.  They have a huge menu which always throws me for a loop (I'm not used to so many choices!) and everything they offer is vegan.  The first time I visited Veggie House, I made the mistake of trying to be healthy and ordered an all-veggie stir fry dish.  It wasn't bad, but I've come to find out that they specialize in fake meats.  Now, I've been a vegetarian for over six years so I'm not the best person to ask on how much the fake meats taste like the real deal but I'm going to go ahead and guess \"not very.\"  I also want to say that I don't care because I find the food here delicious.  Things I've had that are really great: General Tso's chicken, crispy beef, orange beef, sizzling chicken (think an Asian version of fajitas), and curry roti.  Things I've had that are skippable: vegetable soup, spring rolls, the happy sushi roll (way too much of a fishy taste for me, but my husband liked it).  Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and large.  My only complaint is that I wish the items were a dollar or two cheaper so that I could feel better about ordering a third item to share with my husband instead of the usual two (yes, I'm a pig).  But fake meats can be pricey so I understand.  A restaurant that has an entire menu I can order from!  Take that, Chinatown!",

This place however I think may have changed his mind.      We both had the lunch special, orange chicken with brown rice for myself and the sweet and sour chicken with white rice for my husband. Between the two of us we shared a nice pot of hot green tea. The food was absolutely delectable and my husband (the one who doesn't like Chinese food) cleaned his plate! Neither one of us are vegan but you don't even miss the meat with the way chef Kenny prepares the food. I'm not sure what kind of cooking magic is going on in the kitchen but it works and this has to be some of the best Chinese food I've ever had.       Last but definitely not least the staff is very friendly, service is prompt and they come to check with you periodically. The atmosphere is small and cozy and has a lot of the decorations that are to be expected at a Chinese restaurant, Buddha bellies everywhere and a pretty little pond with flowers and foliage surrounding it. Overall experience was excellent and can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Been here about five times and have never been dissappointed. Gotta big up the homie Tien N. for recommending the Spicy Beef.. so money. I usually get the honey walnut shrimp but is usually one of the those things you just gotta eat there or shortly after because after that the flavor and even moreso the texture of the faux shrimp becomes more prevalent. Asian style decor and ambiance is cozy with faux fountain and birds to go with your faux meat to boot!   Service is typically on point and welcoming. Probably my only gripe is the prices of the joint as I was spoiled with the numerous, tasty but cheap ones back home in the Bay Area. Veggie House knows that they're probably the best at their job in doing the Chinese faux meat thing here in Vegas so I reckon they feel they can command the prices they do. All in all I recommend this place for those looking to give their digestive tract a bit of a break, veggie lovers and those skeptical of the wonders of faux meat/texturized soy protein. Come with an open mind and don't knock it till you've tried it then realize you just reduced that carbon footprint of yours.",

    "text": "A phenomenal hidden gem near the Las Vegas Strip! My husband and I recently moved from the Bay area where we had a variety of vegan restaurant options. Moving to Vegas was disheartening because the dining choices are not as vegan friend as we used to. When a group of friends visited from Cali, they were considered enough to offer going to a vegan restaurant. From the group of 6, I was the only vegan, my friend was a pescatarian and the rest of the group were omnivores/carnivores.   We ordered a variety of dishes and a total of four soups, which were initially brought out. One soup was better than the other and I was continually amazed at the phenomenal taste and authentic flavors of each soup. My friends were equally delighted. As the dishes came out, everybody was amazed how \"real\" the food tasted. In fact, one of them apparently did not even realize he was eating imitation meat! He just thought that the restaurant was vegan friendly but that they had meat options. This is a guy who eats meat for every meal!  After hearing  everyone's very positive feedback, a few days later I invited another visitor friend of mine to try their dining experience. She absolutely loved it as well.   After the first visit to say the least, I've gone back a lot more. Each time, the atmosphere has been very relaxing and zen; the staff very approachable and extremely friendly; the food has been consistently delicious!!  Overall, this place is definitely my new go-to place for everything- whether it'd be to treat a cold, take our guests, or just have a great time. (When I feel a bit under the weather or get a cold, their soups are a must. I completely recover the day after!)  If you're a local, whether vegan or not, this place is a must to check out! If you've visiting, they're very close to the strip so be sure to visit for a very relaxing and delicious experience.   NOTE FOR THE VEGANS: If you are Vegan, make sure to let the staff know. I was told that some of their foods may contain eggs- but nothing more. Make sure to ask and they'll let you know the dishes that are off limits.",

So as I patiently waited for someone to assist  me another family walk through  the door. So Ying walked over greeted them blatantly took their order than in the middle of placing their order than decides to ask me for my order. Then she takes mine. After I realized  I wanted the walnut shrimp. So I went back politely asked her if I could also order walnut  shrimp. She said she would send someone over. Then carmen comes over  I explain to her I needed to make an additional order.  So I had explain  it a few times. Then I realized Ying didn't tell any one I needed to make an additional order, Then Ying shows up  dancing in front of me like making a mockery out if the situation.  Then they disappeared  to the back. So I sit and wait its seems  like its taking  3 times longer for just the single order of walnut shrimp. Then a Chef walks to the front asked if I had been helped so I explained  I was waiting on my walnut shrimp. Then 2 minutes  later Carmen walks out with the Shrimp. I tipped  Carmen but I didn't  tip Ying for placing  the other family  and order first. If I would have know carmen would disappear for my first order  could sit and get Cold I would not have tipped her either. The food is amazing.  But the service  sucked. So enter through the front door fir good servuce or you will be treated like a vagrant sitting  on a chair looking at the menu.  The food is a 10. The service is a big negative  if you enter from the back.",

It could only be better if they had  on the menu. Veggie House should be a national chain!!",

    "text": "Prior to being a vegetarian, I used to LOVE eating Chinese food but found it extremely difficult to do because many of the Chinese restaurants I would go to would be laced with meat products in some way, shape, or form. So, I was happy to find a Chinese restaurant vegetarian friendly (vegan, even).   I went to dinner here on Mother's Day and it wasn't too crowded. The place is small and very old-looking but don't let that bother you. The menu options here are insane. I had to double check with our server, Jeffrey, just to make sure that even exotic menu items like their shark fin soup was actually vegan...it was, wow! I have been a vegetarian for years now and was so glad that I could, for the first time, pick from the entire menu at a Chinese restaurant. It was an exhilarating feeling!   We ordered the Mushroom V Chicken, Spicy Pad Thai Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken, Hot Spicy Szechuan Tofu, a shrimp dish that I don't remember the name of, and Spring Rolls. Everything was good except the Mushroom V Chicken and the shrimp. With the shrimp, it had the same texture as real shrimp but had this really odd taste that was far from shrimp-like. Depending on a number of variables, that might be good or bad to others. I never liked shrimp even before I was a vegetarian because it had a certain taste, but this vegan shrimp had such an odd taste that I did not care for it.  Something that spoke to me even more than the food, though, was the customer service. In all my experience eating at Chinese restaurants, I have never seen good customer service until I came here. In my experience, employees at Chinese restaurants are mean, have an attitude, yell at you, and even act like serving you is a chore. Here at Veggie House is a completely different story. I was so surprised to see and hear servers providing exceptional customer service to customers. Our own server, Jeffery, was amazing too! He'd even joke around with us, making us laugh and adding a really comfortable air to our table. The other servers would even come around to other tables asking if they needed anything and refilling their waters. Amazing staff here that I hope is consistent throughout their hours of service.   I would certainly come back here to try other menu items, even bringing along my non-vegetarian family members. I very much appreciate a business such as Veggie House catering to vegetarians and vegans who sorely miss eating Chinese food.",

Most orange chicken at the other places are full of dough and filler. This is very good.   Spicy eggplant!  This is great and something you don't always find at regular restaurants.   Chow Mein- okay I know you can get this at most normal places. But it is so good here.   I will continue to come here and try many different dishes. But so far I find this to be one of the favorites!    Check it out vegan or not. Good place to hang.",

The workers here were very sweet and the location it's self was sort of small and the tables where kinda cramped together so the table next to us would often join in on our conversation. There decorating could be better it looks like a Asian theme wedding in there but it's not that bad. I really like how they have reusable chopsticks  and there own homemade spicy sauce but I'm a person that is not supposed to consume soy and basically all there alternatives are made with soy and so is there ice cream , so I wish they did have a little more variety in that, other then that I did enjoy this place and would come again.",

Greeted with a great big greeting with a smile, we were whisked to our table and served iced-water then asked if we would like some Chinese tea or something else to drink. Within a moment, the Chinese tea appeared. We placed our order quickly and even though we didn't ask, they offered up an explanation of the various \"meats\"that were in the dishes. Frankly, I was grateful for that. They offered us a dessert but didn't push anything at all on us. We found a Groupon that they gave us absolutely no trouble at all accepting and not even a hair of a funny look. In fact, she helped me with it. They checked on us an appropriate number of times and didn't push us in any way shape or form. The menu is quite varied but it is similar to his other establishment up the street. The food arrived quickly and was hot. We ordered oyster mushrooms with lemongrass sauce and a vegan Japanese ramen. We also ordered the Roti with curry which was delicious. They forgot to discount our Groupon but that was remedied, though they didn't seem so happy to do it.. Also without requesting, a bottle of house special hot sauce was placed on the table with appropriate caution about how spicy it might be. I happen to love spicy so this worked very well for me. The restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean. The spacing between the tables is pretty good. The prices are fair and one might call it cheap in Sin City. This was an outstanding experience and I would bring anyone here without batting an eyelid.  We enjoyed it here enough that we returned a second time during our week-long visit to Sin City and we had another good experience. On this visit we ordered the highly recommended crispy beef and my soup loving life ordered another soup - the only one available in cup size which was the vegetable. For her meal, she ordered the Seafood sizzling plate. The service was very good again, the food was hot and tasted great, though again it was a little on the sweet side.",

We ordered Vegetarian Goose which is one of the litmus dishes in a solid vegetarian restaurant and it completely failed.  Instead of the tofu skin being soft and tasty, it came hard (brittle at some places) and tasteless; instead of having a variety of vegetables as filler, it has some kind of goofy stuffing material that tasted like mashed potatoes but has an elastic texture.  May be I don't really want to know.  The oyster mushroom dish was no different than an ordinary sweet and sour deep-fried mushroom dish.  The dishes are on the expensive side considering the location and the quality.   I will get my vegetarian fix on my next road trip to Vancouver B.C.",

Put them together and I'm an instant fan.  \"Beef\" with Broccoli, and an eggplant dish were my favorite dishes here. I wasn't a big fan of their ramen to be honest.  Service here is surprisingly great.",

You can always start out with an appetizer or two. My spouse loves the orange chicken and orders it every time we go. I am the one that usually tries different things when we go there, which is an uncommon thing for me to do. I love the soups. Recommend just getting water if you don't want a pop. Also another nice thing is that it is a place of vegan/vegetarian options. Food has been delicious every time and they get the food to you in pretty quick time. We have always had good customer service when we have gone.",

EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS and the \"fake meat\" was freaking awesome! Hunnie Bunnie doesn't usually like the fake stuff but it doesn't have an offensive taste here and it really is damn good! You wouldnt even know everything here was vegan if you were in a blind taste test!  EVERYONE should try this place out! It's phenomenal!! VEGAN LIFE!!!!!!",

Choose brown rice, it is made perfectly.  The only con I can think of is that the Thai iced tea is an unnatural shade of Kraft #7 orange & it freaks me out on a health/vegan level.  Also, once they were kind of rude & argued with us on whether an order was ours, but Chef Kenny cleared it up with no problems, so I can forgive that.",

I came with my boyfriend who is a spicy food addict (we are talking about eating habaneros like popcorn, or adding ghost pepper, Carolina reapers and Scorpio Trinidad to his everyday meals, not jalapenos).  He order the Chicken Kung Pao extra spicy , and was pretty amazing. Even I had to steal half of his plate because... well, sharing is caring. I order the cilantro salad, I really liked it but I wish it was a little bit more sour. I also got the oyster mushrooms with lemongrass sauce. I have to say that as someone who used to eat oyster mushrooms on a daily basis, I didn't like that they battered them and deep fried them. Those mushrooms are super tasty per se, so in my opinion they should just saute them on the wok. BUT, the flavor was pretty good. I'm not complaining, I just didn't feel like deep fried stuff.  I basically obligated my boyfriend to order desert for himself, because I can't eat sugar right now but I needed to try their sweet side. He got the sticky rice with vanilla ice cream and it was pretty good. He didn't complain and took him 5 seconds to eat it all.  Overall, the service is super nice, the ambiance is pretty busy (Thursday at 12:30) and we are coming back for sure, because they have a pretty big menu and I'm gonna have to try it all.   5 stars, can't wait to come back!",

It's a good thing we got here a little before 6pm on a Tuesday because every table was taken in 30 minutes with even more people waiting to be seated.  I can't think of another 2nd floor plaza restaurant doing business this brisk except for Ichiza.  Good for them!  General Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.    I also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?  This is Chinese vegetarian heaven!  They even do ramen for chrissakes!",

To start, we ordered the Happy Roll and Spring Rolls. Though I am not a fan of crispy vegetables in a roll, I had to give them a try! Like I said, crispy veggies aren't my thing but the roll was good with the crisp and sauce and I'm happy I tried it. My sister absolutely loved these. The spring rolls had a great and light crisp outside, with a creamy steamed vegetable texture fill -- great combo and VERY flavorful.  Next we ordered the Chow Mein noodles -- I'll be dreaming of this plate. The \"beef, chicken, and shrimp\" within this dish were mind blowing. Our dad isn't Vegan but absolutely enjoyed the \"meat\".   The sweet and sour chicken were crisped to perfection, I couldn't believe it! Our dad ordered a steamed broccoli plate incase he wasn't a fan of the \"meats\". Turns out that because everything was so delicious, that was his least favorite dish.  Service/Staff: Kenny was a great host and our waitress was very attentive. We also had other staff members check on us but it wasn't too much nor interrupting to our meal or experience. Their approach was in great time! Kenny also brought everyone something that wasn't on the menu: Fried clam mushrooms...I could've had a whole bowl of these. Hopefully they will be on the menu as an appetizer during my next visit",

The spicy crispy oyster mushroom and the sauce that came with it was sweet and savory. Loved it.   On top of that, their vegan thai tea was the best vegan thai tea that ive ever had.

Chef Kenny even came out and sat with us to chat.  The service was impeccable, and our waitress made an excellent suggestion, an eggplant dish, and I was in heaven.  My husband had sesame veggie chicken, and we couldn't decide which tasted better.  We might head over there one more time before leaving Vegas, even though there are hundreds of places to eat here that are closer. We think it's worth the drive. Amazing tasty food, all vegan,  great prices, lovely ambiance, and exceptional service.  Couldn't ask for more, but I did ask the chef if he would open one in Tucson!",

The server also dropped food off at our table and then came back, took it, and dropped it off at the table next to ours. This happened twice. The the server took forever to come back when we were finishing up. She brought us our checks without even asking if we wanted dessert. We then waited another 10-15 minutes for dessert. They then told my friend that they were out of what she ordered for dessert. The server took forever to pick up our cash. It was ridiculous. It wasn't even very busy in the restaurant. Judy was our server. Disappointed nonetheless.",

China town in itself is unique off the strip experience and it really does feel like you're in Asia. To find the restaurant, you need to walk up stairs to the second level of the plaza (there is also an elevator). I've been to Veggie House twice. The first time I didn't like it so much and I ate very little because the flavor of the food was too meat-like (but maybe that's a compliment to the chef for people who like the flavor of meat - he got it right on). The second time I ate there was much better. I went with friends and was able to try a bit of everything because we ordered a bunch of food to share. I recommend the roti, chicken lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken, and their meatballs in that order. I also found a coupon on groupon so I plan to go back and see if there's anything else I might like. Overall it's worth a visit for it's uniqueness and wide variety of vegetarian/vegan options (where else in the world are you going to find vegetarian geese on a menu!?).",

    "text": "As much as i like this place i often find my liking reduced to a handful of dishes off the lunch menu.  First off the food is very light and a bit on the bland side. more often than not i find myself wondering if i could get away with asking for some table salt or some soy sauce but that'll defeat the purpose of eating wholesome healthy vegetarian food.  Another reason i like Veggie house is the food doesnt exactly bloat you up unlike...well pretty much everything else. It's a good feeling of full without actually physically feeling like you're gut is going to explode.   Recommendations? Ice cream is always a good choice as they get supplied from Perfect Scoop so expect yummy high quality hand made ice cream 100% of the time, all the time.  The crispy spicy beef has got to be one of the greatest items on the menu. Not judging this based on taste, if this was a taste game then the rating would be 5 stars not 4. This is due to the texture of the faux beef. Other items such as the kung pow beef or beef with broccoli the texture is close to a tofu like mushroom and carries a similar taste if it wasn't for the sauces.  So overall this place is definitely worth a stop for lunch but dont expect a 100% accurate vegetarian replacement for meat.  As for the vegetarian alternatives for fish...we'll see about that in the updated review...  Yelp 100 - 034 of 100",

We ordered  - Spring Rolls (average) - Crispy Egglplant (AMAZING) - Kung Pao Chicken (good/average) - Chow Mein with Vegetables (good but very oily) - Fried Non-Vegan Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream (Would recommend but ask for flavor availability)  I came here with my family of four while the establishment was somewhat busy for lunch. The biggest issue was that there were only 2 waitresses who were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until I mentioned it. In addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. Lastly, we had ordered the the Fried Ice Cream with Mango Ice Cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. When we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. It was just a frustrating experience.  Overall, the food was good, but the service lacking. I would come back to eat the Crispy Eggplant because it was SO GOOD.",

I ordered the spicy pad Thai, walnut shrimp, sizzling beef and broccoli, the 3 appetizer of cucumber salad, wontons and spring rolls, as well as roti with curry. Everything was fresh and delicious! We did learn after that the shrimp is made with a bit of corn starch so a warning to those with sensitive stomachs. The cucumber salad is a little spicier than I expected. It was a great experience and I would have no hesitation coming back to try more things on the menu. If I can learn to cook like that I might consider being completely vegan!",

    "text": "This is definitely my new favorite vegan restaurant ever!  My family and I were visiting Las Vegas for a high school reunion. We found this restaurant on Yelp while searching for good Vegan Restaurants near me. This immediately came up. We almost didn't go here ( but I'm so glad we did) because there were many other restaurant options. However, the menu item that caught my eye was the vegan honey walnut shrimp. (I know what you may be thinking \"what the heck is vegan shrimp?\" And the answer is the BEST thing ever) We also got the barbecue meat and crunchy chow mein (and were delighted to see that they were not cheap on the gravy like most restaurants) which was also super delicious. That same day we were also supposed to go to watch the Circus de Soleil day, KA, and had about 45 minutes to eat. We kind of mentioned to our waiter that we were in a rush and they were so nice to us. Within five minutes, our appetizers and main courses were out. They were SUPER nice about it too! Although we were in a rush, I did take the time to also notice the beautiful decor. It kind of reminded me of a white garden wedding. Overall, this place is DEFINITELY a must eat in Vegas whether you are plant-based or not. The service was AMAZING and the food was DELICIOUS! And we will definitely be back.",

My friend actually eats here at least once a week which is what convinced me to check this place out with him. Maybe my expectations were a little too high but I was surprisingly disappointed.   PROS:  Let me start by explaining my reasoning for being extremely disappointed with this place yet still giving three stars, instead of one, by listing three positives.   1. The service was excellent 2. They offer a brown/black rice option (instead of white) 3. The cherry chocolate chip vegan ice cream - YUM!  CONS: If you like fried, greasy foods and sauces loaded with excessive amounts of sugar then this might not be a negative for you. But if you're like me and expect something somewhat healthy (I mean, it is called Veggie House, right?) then you will be disappointed and underwhelmed.   Imagine taking a big bottle of syrup and squeezing it into your mouth, that is what the sauces tasted like. Personally, if I wanted to eat something this unhealthy, I would have splurged on a delicious thin crust pizza from Pizza Rock (drool). But even that would have been a much healthier option.",

Left my carry out on the table unattended for five minutes today, only to find that my cat had fished out one of the shrimp from my rice, and dragged it to the middle of the living room to feast on.

I myself am not a strict vegetarian but I respect those who are. Moreover, the chef himself is highly regarded and conscientious about his recipes.   The delivery option here is good, but I would recommend you jist bring yourself in. These dishes succeed because of their hard earned texture which gets a bit lost for some items in the ride of over. If you do order take out then choose options like the orange chicken which will be just as good and avoid crispy items that would obviously become soggy. It is no different than if ordering fish and chips to go - don't ever do it.",

The food is well seasoned and. Very filling. We had the following starting with our favorite dish the crispy eggplant! So good the table of 4 ordered 2 orders! Then the Szechuan  tofu, which is sauteed with green peas and carrots! Yummy. My second favorite then I ordered the (I think it was ) the braised tofu which was fried tofu and mixed veggies again yum and great cold the next day too!! Our least favorite was the Tom Yum soup and I think it just needed some meat type stick instead of veggie. It was flat but they made it right. And don't miss their brown rice it's super nutty and fabulous!!! I would definitely go back but do note the dishes have sodium in them. Good or bad as we are not used to much salt but they don't taste salty and that's good by me!",

We ordered delivery: chow mein, kung pao chicken and veggie dumplings, which ended up being a whopping $47 with tip. Guys, it was NOT worth it in the least. The chow mein was completely flavorless and swimming in thick oil. The dumplings were dry and so, so bland. The kung pao was the only edible dish (in that it had some flavor/spice) but it, like the chow mein, was strangely swimming in a kind of flavorless, thick oil sauce. Heart attack city.  Just...weird and bad and so, so overpriced. Can't speak to restaurant ambiance or service but the food was awful, vegan or not. Never eating here again.",

We were very impressed with the food!  It tastes better than what many NC restaurants serve.  I loved the crispiness and the textures of what we ordered.  You knew you were getting fresh veggies!  Also, I some how missed my pocket and left my wallet behind.  I thought, \"I left it on the strip or in a casino!\"  I frantically search everywhere I'd been that evening for 24 hours, except the Veggie House.  I threw in the towel and I filled out a police report so I could get on the plane to go back home.    I get home and couple days later, the owner of the restaurant found me on Facebook providing his contact information.  I called him and he sent my wallet back 100% intact, cash, cards, & IDs.    I'm dumb for losing my wallet.    However, the owner of the Veggie House and his staff are honest, caring and want you to enjoy your experience.  Even if you dislike Chinese food,  Go on principal of great character by all those that are associated with the restaurant!    I had lower expectations of Vegas prior to this trip.  The smog sucks but the food is great!    Thanks for being AWESOME Veggie House!",

But, that is my solid order, comes out amazing every time. This place is very consistent, has great service, and is a decent price! For dessert try the cherry ice cream. They do give to these cute,little, yummy guava candies with the check as well. Everything is 100% vegan and chef Kenny is a culinary genius.   Right now there's a groupon = $11 for $20 voucher, get that, and try this place out! You won't regret it :)!   Favorite vegan restaurant by far. Ive taken all of my non-vegan family members and friends here, they love it.",

By far our favorite thing was the crispy spicy eggplant. We also got the happy veggie roll as a small app and the tamarind fish curry, which were both excellent as well. Service was quick and pleasant.   The only downside (not a big deal) is that this place is tricky to find. When you pull into the shopping complex it is on the second floor on the left hand corner when facing the complex. If you go up the left hand set of stairs it should put you right in front of the restaurant.   Five stars, would return.",

I have been in Las Vegas for over 20 years now and has never been 100% satisfied with any of the Chinese restaurants that I've tried around town and this was before I change my eating habits to where they are today which is very close to a vegan lifestyle, So for this Genius of a chef to take vegetarian and vegan food mainly vegan and make it taste better than the real stuff it's crazy. I honestly cannot wait to return, I tell people about this place even my non-vegan friends every single day, and the non-vegan friends that have gone with me loves it. One of my Carnivore friends truly thought that he was eating real chicken and beef and that I was eating real shrimp LOL!",

There are absolutely no animal products in the foods prepared here! I haven't eaten meat in over twenty-five years, but I remember how it tastes and what kind of texture, or \"mouth-feel\", it has.  Chef Kenny has mastered his technique into creating soy meats that mimic the actual thing. So real, in fact, that I had to ask more than once if there were animal products in my dish. Chef Kenny HIMSELF emerged from behind the scenes to sit down and chat with us at the table. What a nice, sincere, humble and talented man!

Yes some food here is made with flour and grease but not all vegan food is 100% grassed flavored/raw or super healthy, just healthier (there are such things as chubby vegans). Having said that, my wife and I LOVE this place! the portions are great the flavor is even better (as far as vegan goes since I don't recall what actual meat tastes like)  and the service is very welcoming. Often they have specials on groupon so be on the look out for those.",

I used to come to this establishment all the time when it was a wonton house lol. So coming back was pleasant and the new food too! Service was friendly and great! The food came out quickly as well. They have a lunch special from 11:30-3:00 for $6.50, with comes with a variety of selections from tofu, veggies,fish,and even seafood! It also comes with soup, served with white or brown rice or you can opt for a bun roll. Everything was priced so decently, it won't take much to fill you up and NOT hurt the wallet! I had Thai tea and #97 Hunan Scallop Pan Fried Noodle. Both of which were tasty!  I am definitely coming back to try out their other dishes and have a jab at the dessert menu next time I come! Btw, they have free wifi too!",

The staff are friendly and accommodating. The food is absolutely fantastic and it will definitely fool the hardiest of meat lovers. I tried the walnut shrimp (highly recommend!) sesame chicken, crispy beef and broccoli, and the general tso chicken. I also tried the pineapple duck which was absolutely disgusting! The texture was very spongy and the taste was so gross, we had to waste the entire thing. It tasted like a sponge marinated in liquid smoke, soy sauce, and pineapple juice. Anyway, I highly recommend this place in any direction and it's very refreshing to have a vegan eatery. Hopefully Vegas will catch on to more vegan eateries!",

This place is tucked away in Chinatown and I never would have come across it had it not been for Groupon, so I'm very thankful haha. The food here is really great, the service is fast and the entire staff is incredibly friendly and nice. The first time I ever went here the menu was a bit overwhelming and I didn't know what to choose but one of the servers was very open to make recommendations and I finally went with the Crispy Spicy Eggplant. This dish is a must try and I highly recommend it! I've dined here about 10 times and each time I try to get something different but I tend to always gravitate back to the CS Eggplant. As a vegan, this place was a god-send as it's not easy to find somewhere that has a variety of vegan dishes to choose from, and delicious ones at that. I've also brought my family here a few times and even though they are meat-eaters they still really enjoyed this place. Something else that I love about Veggie House is the portion size of all of their dishes. They really do give you a great sized portion that will fill you up and you may even have leftovers (if you can manage to get yourself to stop eating their delicious food, which is unlikely). Each time I'm in Vegas I have to go to Veggie House at least a couple times during my visit. I can't wait to be back in town this summer so I can go to one of my favorite restaurants and get my Crispy Spicy Eggplant fix.",

This is a vegetarian restaurant that does a range of chinese food dishes with fake meat (gluten). If you are a vegetarian that doesn't care for food that tries to be meat, then there are plenty of other dishes on the menu. All good. I'm vegetarian and don't miss meat but was curious to try things like crispy ginger beaf, lotus cakes, lemon chicken. Tasted great! My meat eater friends said that they came close to the real thing!  The staff are really, really sweet. Very happy and engaging! The owner check in to make sure you are happy.   We were in vegas for three nights and ate there for two of them.  The decor and setup of the restaurant is very clean and simple. As you would expect for a startup restaurant with the usual startup budget.",

We looked for a health department rating  and didn't see one. We decided to head over to Veggie House, and  immediately decided we would dine there instead. (\"A\" rating, tablecloths, and sign that read, \"Please do not bring in seafood or meat.\") I have eaten at Vegan Chinese restaurants in Philly and New York, but this one in VEGAS is the best by far.  Chef Kenny prepares the meals in a gourmet fashion. In a swanky setting, these meals could easily go for 3X the price. The portions are very generous, and each entree is bursting with a multitude of flavors. We had the fried wonton appetizers, which had a wonderful crispy texture and flavor.  I had the walnut scallops, which were out of this world. The flavor was so unique and amazing. My husband ordered the General Tzo's chicken which was equally tasty. Did I mention the pumpkin cheesecake? WOW. The food was served to us very quickly and the service was top-notch and incredibly friendly! A+++++ We will definitely dine here again and spread the word!",

We did order the house noodles, not thinking about the non chicken & non shrimp, the gravy was way too greasy and way too thick, and the eggplant is so fried you can't taste anything but grease.  I guess it's great if you really don't eat meat to come here & pretend like you're eating meat, but I don't think it's all that great Chinese food to begin with.  It's just ok.  The service was ok, I think they were too busy for the 3 of them so we really didn't get any service besides when they were bringing our food.

For my entree I had the 'Teriyaki Chicken' and it was not appealing. I went to bite into it and I wasn't sure if the bottom half was made of a paper or a pastry. It was very chewy and didn't know if it was suppose to be eaten. I decided to break it in half and eat the top half which was amazing, especially with my rice. Overall, I will give it another shot, but I will try something that isn't 'chicken'",

Funniest thing she thought she was ordering real shrimp and when she tried it she still couldn't tell the difference until she had a few more bites. So I guess that's a good thing. Good place overall",

Dined here twice and was favorably impressed each time.  Portions are ample (so much so that I did not partake of dessert, which I intend to do on my next visit).  Chef/owner Kenny Chye moves easily among patrons and, in my opinion, is to be commended for some of his original creations.",

The servers and chef were very friendly and went out of their way to provide excellent service. The chef even brought out one of his new dishes, free of charge, so we could sample it. It's obvious that he takes a great deal of pride in preparing delicious plant-based dishes. The prices were reasonable and the ambience was lovely.

My girlfriend and I purchased the groupon and went in for lunch. I've been to pretty much every vegetarian restaurant in the valley and I must say, this place was delicious. Much of the time I find that Asian vegetarian joints just have veggie meats and somehow that makes for a good meal, like the mediocre \"Veggie Delight.\" But Veggie house seems to have out a lot of time into their menu and combination of flavors. We ordered the BBQ meat appetizer and the sauce was delicious. We had braised tofu and crispy eggplant for our Entrees and both were unique and flavorful. Both dishes had distinct flavors and had obviously been developed by someone who cares about flavor profiles. Our server was nice and accommodating and she made suggestions that were delicious. We will be dining here again and spreading the word about the flavors.",

Ambience is not fantastic - overhead strip lighting, a TV stuck to the wall, some strange indoor tent erected over a table and it's on the second floor of a strip mall but it is clean and when you find great vegan chinese food at extremely reasonable prices, who cares? Still thinking about how tasty it all was a week later.  On the next trip to Las Vegas we will definitely be returning to eat once more at the Veggie House...",

We just pretty much didn't know what to do. We searched for vegan restaurants and came upon Veggie House. My wife and I were unsure of eating vegan Chinese food but we gave it try. We went and asked the waitress if everything was vegan and it is except for a couple dishes that have egg in it but you can ask to have without the egg. We ordered Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, House Lo-Mein, and Beef and Broccoli. When we first got the food on the table it looked like normal Chinese food. I took my first bite and it tasted amazing. Not just amazing for vegan food but amazing overall! This place is the best Chinese food I've had in years period!!! You wouldn't even think it was vegan. My wife and I took family there and they didn't even know it was vegan. They thought it was all actual chicken, shrimp, and beef. Their minds were blown when we told them it was vegan lol. I frequent this place about once a week maybe twice. Hands down a must place to go for anyone who LOVES good food.",

Me and a friend entered through the rear entrance of the establishment and had to wait a while because they were extremely busy. We had a perfect view into the kitchen and were watching one of the chefs prepare a dish in a wok. during the prep we witnessed the chef use the cooking utensil as his own personal tasting spoon several times and continued to use it in the cooking process. I watched in horror after every taste he put the cooking utensil back in the wok and continued cooking with it. After about the 4th taste, he plated it up and took one more taste before sending it out to the table. I watched the entire thing because had to make sure he wasn't just cooking up his own personal lunch. I shared this story with my vegan/vegetarian friends, and none of us will ever eat there again.",

    "text": "Not too long ago I bought a groupon to Veggie house because I was craving something different and being new to Vegas I also wanted to explore so Veggie house killed two birds with one stone. After I bought the groupon I started to think about what I can expect and I came on here to get a heads up on the menu, decor stuff like that but I still retained an open mind so that I could enjoy the experience and write this review. Everyone said the food and atmosphere was great and they didn't lie. It was a little jewel in china town above a strip mall, you would walk right by it if you weren't looking for it and I liked that. Upon entering the restaurant I noticed how light the restaurant felt, it gave you that feel good vibe, there was no wait time and the hostess was friendly. The restaurant was clean and the sound of running water which was coming from the decor was delightful and calming. A waitress came to our table right away and asked if we had ever been there before, you could tell that she cared about the reputation of the restaurant and the quality of our experience, I loved that. After I said no she proceeded to tell me about the specials and what she would recommend and even asked me what my taste were (at this point it was groupon be damned and I was going to pay full price for the food and experience). I ordered the roti for the appetizer and for dinner I ordered the seaweed steam with basil and my sister had the fried eggplant. With the waitress gone we were able to soak up the ambiance of the restaurant , 5 mins after that appetizers came and 20 mins after that the dishes were on the table. At first bite I was in love with my dish, it was really spicy just like I like and it had a bold flavor (I thought that the seaweed would have a fishy off putting taste to it but it didn't). It had exactly the flavors I wanted and was just different enough to add to  my overall experience. My sister's experience was slightly different, she is a very picky eater since birth and found the eggplant too sweet for her liking but after urging her to put some soy sauce on it (soy sauce has a lot of sodium so I knew it would balance out the sweetness) she was liking her dish too. So desert was next up I ordered the green tea ice cream and she had the cherry ice cream, my ice cream was more of a palate cleanser and seeing as how I love tons of sugar and like I said I wanted something different it was good. My sister's experience of her desert was 4 thumbs up and she would go back just to get the ice cream (being that the place is like 2 hours away from where we live by bus that's saying something). I would recommend veggie house to anyone that lives or visits Vegas, this place really made my day.",

    "text": "So I hear this place is all the rave.  Yes, I am an avid carnivore, but not too rigid to refuse new things.  I had no idea that this place is primarily Chinese influenced, except for the twist that it's vegan.  You can find the eatery tucked in the corner on the second floor of the original SF Market shopping plaza.  While going to the bathroom, I noticed that there is parking out back that offers easy access to the restaurant via a ramp from the side of the building.  Practically everything here resembles most Chinese cuisines, except for the fact that there is no meat!  There is even a sign saying that they'll chop you head off if you come in with a slim jim or something of the sort...well maybe not that radical, but something to that affect.  Yet, the vegan faux meats is unparalleled.  I am guessing that most of it is derived from soy/tofu, but one cannot be sure.  Chef Kenny offers pineapple duck, general tso's chicken, and even seafood dishes, all ingredients are made with meatless plant proteins, natural spices, seasonings and even organic. No MSG, preservatives, or food coloring are added as well.  We started with the crab and shark fin soup (delish) and had the spicy beef with brocoli with curry mushroom plate.  Its amazing how closely the faux meat resembles real meat and like to think frying the ingredients has a lot to adding to the texture.  I can't wait to try some of the other dishes that were on rotation digitally on the flat screen TV's in the dining area.  Each time i peeked up, I say something else I wanted to try in the future.  The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  There were only two servers and the place is pretty petite, but handled well on the floor.  The place is designed with several cabana themes and a small pond inside.  Nothing flashy and colors were neutral and not surprising.  Maybe a little interior decorating wouldn't hurt.  The place was clean and very well kept to say the least.  Even Chef Kenny was roaming around greeting guests, this says a lot.  I thought that the dishes would be pricier given that it was a vegan joint, but not the case at all.  Everything is reasonably priced and competitive with similar (non vegan) dishes alike.  Although, because the place is small and popular, there could be a slight wait.    Overall, very good place and a great addition for those who are either vegan or vegetarian.",

When I came down to Veggie House, I was overjoyed to see the menu resembling what I was familiar with down by the Equator. And then, I found out that chef/owner Kenny Wang is a Malaysian! Mystery solved.   The dishes that I have thoroughly enjoyed here include the following:  Roti Canai - With a heavenly curry dipping gravy that is ditto what I used to savor in Southeast Asia  Pork Chop - You can get a half order of this. Very inventive - 3 different textures (soft, fatty and then crispy) welded together and deliciously seasoned  Braised Tofu - The preparation of tofu is just fantastic. Soft beancurd lightly fried and then immersed in a brown gravy. Perfection. The vegetables on this dish were also so crisp and fresh!  Curry Vegetables with Tamarind Sauce - I love this take on curry. In Asia, it's called Assam Curry and is widely available and one of the most popular and tasty dishes. However, it's seldom prepared well outside Southeast Asia...Kenny's done a stellar job. Crispy potato pieces, brimming with veggies in a delicious curry sauce with that amazing tamarind tinge.   Fried Rice and Flat Noodles - Yummy. Prepped the way I love it. Simple, tasty and satisfactory.   Prices are very reasonable. Less than $7 for a lunch special (choice of brown/white rice or bread) served with soup. The restaurant itself is very pleasant...bright, clean and reasonably furnished. I love the waitresses. They are awesome!  Can't wait to be back at Veggie House!",

I am not personally a fake meat enthusiast, but I think their selection is incredible and unmatched in Vegas. It is definitely a much needed spot for vegetarians and vegans. Plus, I assumed a spot known for faux meat would likely have some delicious vegetables.   We went in for their lunch special that includes rice (white or brown! or a bun) and soup. I ordered the Crispy Spicy Eggplant, and my husband couldn't resist General Tso's \"chicken\". The soup was a bit bland, but I guess that means it couldn't have been loaded up with sodium. The entrees were solid, although given that both were fried they had a built in advantage. I will say that the sauces were more sweet than spicy, which was disappointing, but overall we enjoyed our lunch.   The service was incredibly sweet and attentive. Even the chef came out to check on us. We would definitely return for lunch, but next time we would probably stick to something that isn't fried and perhaps a tofu dish.",

    "text": "Had a lovely lunch here with David S. & Jade W. after volunteering together at Three Square. Had been looking forward to trying this spot, and our meal was more hit than miss. The space has a Zen vibe with a fountain, plants and chimes. Wait staff were super friendly and helpful.   We shared three dishes family style: the much lauded (and rightfully so) crispy, addictive eggplant, ma pao tofu (I'm a huge fan of soft tofu, but I think it needed spice) and curry \"fish\" (we'd ordered black bean but ate it anyway) Here is where the former vegan in me (sooo obnoxious as a Cal undergrad that I would not ingest honey \"because bees worked to make it\" thank goodness I got over myself!) is not a big fan of faux meats, but they seem to be the norm. The \"fish\" had a great sauce with tamarind kick, but texture was somewhat of an issue for all of us. Included in the price was brown (!) rice and a vegetable consomme which was soothing but a little bland.   For 8$ each, inclusive of tax and tip, we ate well and enjoyed the experience.  Definitely worth another visit and I believe even carnivores will enjoy the food as the preparation shows attention to detail and commitment to vegetarian/vegan eats. 8 is also my favorite & lucky number, so I love how they open at 11:38AM according to front door :))",

They say the entree portion is smaller than the dinner size, but it was still a ton - I could only finish about half of mine.  I ordered the sweet and sour \"pork\" because my little brother would always order that when we would go out for Chinese as a kid, and I always wished I could eat it.  It was great.  It wasn't as sweet as I was thinking it would be - I was thinking it would be as sweet as orange chicken.  I was glad I got to finally try it.  My old man had the crisy beef.  It was really good, I loved the texture.  It looked like it would be chewy, like other gluten meats, but it was....crispy.  It had a lot of ginger and was kind of sour.  I'd recommend it over the sweet and sour pork.  We also had the veggie dumplings appetizer - they were good, but I wish they were pan fried instead of deep fried.  Service was outstanding.",

    "text": "I went here on a busy Saturday night about 30 minutes before closing...there were a couple of ppl waiting to be seated, but they had like 3 large family tables open.  3 sets of couples came in after us, so they kept asking people to share tables...I was fine with it but my date wasn't as he wanted privacy to talk to me.  Nobody else wanted to share, even though we were seated fast, it was strange because they made people wait instead of seating 2 at a large table.  So near closing time you would think they would just chance it and seat the couples instead of waiting for a chance of a large party--which never came as after closing the 3-4 large tables were still empty.   Aside from that the food is amazing, fast service, hot, loads of fresh vegetables; General Tzo chicken had great flavor; date had Mongolian beef was good but nothing like the General Tzo great flavor.  Things are fried so I wouldn't say it's all healthy (I don't know what oils they use to wok fry) but I was happy. Not a vegan or vegetarian and love this plaice so much I'm bringing carnivore friends to try.    Tip:  place is upstairs in a the corner (use the stairwell to the right if you're facing supermarket).  Parking better after market closes.  The plaza has a picnic table outside so looks nice if you sit outside and eat to go.",

    "text": "This is a very relaxing restaurant to bring your baby and enjoy a tasty veggie meal. 5 stars!  OK, so don't hate me if you come here to eat and the restaurant is full of newborns. There's a reason Veggie House has a 5 star Yelp rating, and the reviews weren't written by infants. I just think it's worth noting that when we entered the restaurant, my daughter was awake and started to become a little fussy. However, I think a combination of the Chinese serenity chimes music and the soothing waterfall next to our table helped her drift off into a nap while we ate. The dining room was quiet with only 2 other tables occupied. (I shouldn't make these claims without mentioning that you won't find a table for diaper changes in the rest room.)  The roti with curry sauce was great as an appetizer, and the crispy eggplant was as good as other reviewers have noted. I liked the ginger in the flavorful sauce coating the eggplant fries. My husband enjoyed his \"chicken\" fried rice, but the flavor of this dish (maybe from the egg) was not at all appetizing to me. I've had some bad experiences looking for vegetarian entrees in various Chinatown restaurants, so I'm excited to return to Veggie House to try more of the menu! Both waitresses were very friendly and the service shined, down to demonstrating how to tear the roti with forks and dip it in the curry sauce. The chef uses quality ingredients and puts care into each dish. I'll stick to the tofu and vegetable options, as I don't want any fake shrimp floating around on my plate. While they offer everything from veggie goose to veggie ribs, I didn't become a vegetarian to eat fake meats.",

    "text": "Veggie House is located in an Asian complex right above an Asian supermarket. Located just minutes away from the buzz of the city, we picked this because we felt like eating some nice Chinese and were sick of highway fast food.   The service was very pleasant. We were well attended to, and water and tea were great.   The menu was super fun to look at, and as is always is at vegan places, we could order anything off the menu.   We got the Gen Tso's chicken, pan fried dumplings and Pad Thai.  Gen Tso's was good - the chicken imitated real chicken pretty well. I don't think you could really tell it apart from meat.   The Pad Thai came with shrimp and chicken, and although they were imitation meat, my husband couldn't bring himself to eat it. However, the noodles themselves were tasty and flavorful. They also have good spice levels that they ask (0-10). We picked 7 and that was pretty spicy!   Fried dumplings were also tasty, the duck sauce and hot sauce were nice compliments.   Enjoyed this place a lot!",

So if you like food a bit more authentic make sure you let them know that.  We got the stir fried water spinach - it was plentiful and fresh. Delicious  We also ordered the jiao yan tofu - this was good, but could have been improved by jalapenos instead of bell peppers. Also could have used a bit more spicy. The dipping sauce at first was weird as it is not standard offering - plus it was a little sweet. It after a while the flavor grew on us and it was very tasty.",

I have a limited diet - I do not eat dairy due to an allergy and I recently became a vegetarian - and I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant that does not jeopardize it. When my fiance and I visited, we were quickly seated and offered a drink. I ordered the shrimp lunch special and my fiance ordered the sweet and sour pork lunch special. The lunch special also came with soup - which was absolutely delicious! Our entrees came out soon after the soup, and the pork really tasted and had the texture of pork. The shrimp was also delicious, however it did not seem to have the texture of real shrimp, which did not bug me. Overall, I really enjoyed Veggie House, and I will be back!",

    "text": "So it seems like every day there is something going around making people want to give up meat and animal product. Currently in my world it is the documentary \"What the Health\" that has made its way around my office. I for one am someone that is not sure I could give up meat but to be fair I have never really given it a solid effort. In attempt to get on the veggie train I googled places around my work that would meet everyones request (pun intended haha). Lo and behold I stumbled across Veggie House.  First order I placed was last Friday for the Spicy Crispy Eggplant and the Spicy Crisp Beef.  Oh. My. Wow! Both dishes were awesome and didn't last 10 mins. The beef was unreal and left me in shock the whole day wondering how it was possible. How can something look, taste and even have the same texture of beef?!  The eggplant was also a hit however I did not find much \"Crisp\" to it but the flavor was there. I have always been skeptical of Chinese food due to I feel like I am always getting \"mystery meat\" and a lower quality. Nothing is worse than chomping into some weird meat and biting a nerve or fat, talk about deal breaker and meal ruiner. That was not the case at Veggie House. Truly the best Chinese food experience I have ever had and to top it off it was all VEGAN! So today I went back and got the Kung Pao Chicken and House Lo Mien Noodles and gave the Crispy Eggplant another try. Without a doubt another awesome lunch experience... just wish the eggplant was \"Crispy\". Average cost you are looking to spend is about $10-$15 a dish which come in good portions to be shared with 2 people.  I highly recommend trying this place out. See you next week Veggie House!",

Everyone in there is very nice, but the food is just a turn off.  Also, the name of the restaurant is misleading.  The restaurant is NOT purely vegetarian.  They serve meat. **7/30/15** I was informed that the \"meat\" is not meat, but \"soy/veggie meat\" made from soy ingredients. Sorry I was ignorant.***",

The food was okay, nothing all that remarkable but good enough that I would have eaten there again. Time to check out and the balo ey began. We had separate bills but the rule all of a sudden was that they only acxept one Groupon per table. I pointed out that it was two different bills but thay didnt matter. A very umpleasant person came over and said I HAD to pay full price. My friends Groupon was accepted first since they were known there. Really bad idea to treat a new customer like that.

It was definitely interesting to say the least. I've had a fair share of faux like food, but maybe I just needed to order the right things on the menu or adjust my tastebuds.   Also, the lady was very aggressive on ordering dessert after our lunch, but they do have vegan options. The only downside is that it's all soy and no coconut or almond options for ice cream.",

(Plates are big by the way) they also have us a mini tofu soup to start with (tasty!)   It's located on the second floor. There's plenty of free parking in the front or back of the building.",

    "text": "The BEST Chinese Restaurant in Vegas!!  I am not vegetarian or vegan, but that does not stop me from coming here. The food is much healthier than your typical Chinese plate - and that makes a world of a difference! The food tastes so good!!  Chef Lee began making sushi roles, and we visited to sample various kinds. Typically, Veggie Roles are not my favorite - but here, they are DELICIOUS! Each role is beautifully decorated, and the price is much better than most other sushi places. The atmosphere is very pleasant. The servers and hosts are very friendly and willing to accommodate. You can't visit Vegas without visiting this restaurant!  Recommendation: Orange Chicken and Vegas Role. My absolute favorites!  There have been rumors about their previous chef (chef Kenny), but truthfully, the food now is better than when he was working there. Shame on chef Kenny for what he did. He deserved to get fired.",

    "text": "This is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant. After a good friend suggested this place we had to go and visit The Veggie House. It was my first time here and totally will not be my last. You will be welcomed from kind staff and seated to your table. We had the pleasure to eat such an amazing food!  For starters we had their green tea. We had like 4-5 refills since the tea was so good. We began with the chef spinach salad. I loved the taste of the sesame seed dressing with the fresh spinach and fried chopped spring roll papers. I totally recommend it. We ordered the spicy veggie orange beef. I enjoyed how they imitate the color and form to create the feeling like you would eat real meat. This dish was made from soy beef, cooked crispy with a spicy orange peel sauce. With that we also ordered the Spicy Cajun Veggie Fish which is served with brown/white rice. They told us that the tofu is wrapped in seaweed to make it look like fish skin and which also gives it a taste of the sea. Last item we ate was the Szechuan Shrimp, it was amazing. It tasted like real shrimp and the sauce was perfectly spicy and sweet. In total I enjoyed my stay and with every dish we had I felt like I was in heaven. I can't wait to come here again and try more and other of their dishes. As a Vegan it's hard to find Chinese places where they don't work with meat and other animal products. What I totally loved was their sign at the door before you enter \"Please do not bring any kind of meat or seafood to this restaurant\".  Inside seating area is clean and very friendly staff. Unfortunately no outdoor seating area. Since they are on the second floor you can park on the second floor either put it's uncovered. They have two entry ways. The main one in the front and also an other one in the back so you don't have to walk all around the building when you park on their level. I am very happy that I visited this place and I would recommend it to everyone who would like to enjoy Vegan Chinese food.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE this place.   Chef Kenny, the mastermind behind it all, has crafted a rather extensive menu of \"meat\" dishes. While the names will read like normal dishes such as orange chicken, the menu is 100% vegan.   Going one step further, our server explained that the menu was Chinese vegan, meaning they cook with no garlic or onion. My puzzled look must have been obvious because she explained it to me in greater detail. They don't use garlic or onion in order to promote peacefulness of the mind. My google search later on providing me with some very interesting reads on that topic. But back to the review...  The food is phenomenal. I'm not sure if this is True of all the dishes but there are definitely some which I have tried which would have meat eaters fooled.   Pan fried noodles, sizzling dish with tofu and vegetables, and braised tofu. Our favorite was a toss up between the pan fried noodles and the sizzling dish. This is in no way saying the braised tofu was bad.   The pan fried noodles were bursting with flavor. We loved how the noodles were crispy in some parts.  The aroma from the sizzling dish of tofu and vegetables filled the restaurant when they brought it out. We especially liked the texture of the tofu, crisp on the outside. The vegetables were perfectly cooked, still crispy, not over done.   Service was fantastic. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. Chef Kenny even made an appearance to ask how everything was.   I know this will become one of my go to spots. I am telling everyone, this is a must try.",

While Vegans are admirable, I can never imagine myself eating what they eat. Boy, this place blew me away!  We ordered the Spicy Crispy Beef, Cajun Fish, Spicy Crispy Eggplant, Orange Chicken and Roti which came with a side of curry. These were featured on a separate menu as their most popular items and all of which I will definitely order again and again and AGAIN, maybe with the exception of the orange chicken since I didn't even bother tasting it.   Now, it was my choice not to ask what they were made of but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the real thing and the faux meat they served. It was so full of flavor that I didn't even care!   I was shocked with how busy this place was at noon, on a thursday but why shouldn't it be? Vegan style food is the new trend right now. Definitely worth a try!",

It is a family sized bowl and I just act like it's an entree. I also really enjoy the bbq veggie meat from the apps list. It looks like that red bbq pork.   It also delighted my meat-eating family members who are normally not so receptive to veg food. If you brought it to a potluck nobody would suspect it wasn't 'real'",

I merely told the waitress that I had a coupon and she didn't acknowledge my statement so I repeated myself and she snapped at me with a nasty tone and said \"I heard you!\" I replied \"Woah\" and then asked another waiter to speak to the owner, Kenny. I explained that as a customer supporting his business that I shouldn't be talked to like that by his staff. He didn't respond other than nodding his head.  The check came and as the waitress with the attitude passed by two other patrons she muttered something indiscernible and smiled while shaking her head in disapproval and cheeky manner and then the two women both looked at me instantly. Granted I don't know what the waitress said to the two patrons but I felt uncomfortable as a paying customer seeing that here a waitress is (almost definitely) talking about me to two random customers. I then spoke to Kenny, the owner and head chef, to let him know that I felt uncomfortable and felt that his employee was inappropriate. He just said sorry as though he felt obligated to but I didn't feel like he really cared. As a paying, repeating customer I find that to be annoying and disconcerting when I'm not being heard. An \"I'm so sorry ma'am, I'll talk with that waitress. Yes, she was rude and in appropriate\", would have been appreciated.",

My first thought when the server brought it out is how much it looked like real meat! This is the perfect dish if you like spicy, crispy foods. I do not care for white rice, so the brown rice that came with the dish worked well. The best , yet unexpected part of the dish were the nuts on top!

Very basic interior design - but the chef hand made a sweet little fountain garden area on one side of the room to add better ambience.  Some of the other reviews may have gone of off nights - that does happen in restaurants - but that was not our personal experience.

We also ordered Vegan ice cream desserts which ended our meals with full bellies and not as much guilt.  Our servers were great also, she was recommending things and talking to us about being vegan.  She was telling us how she was Vegan 80% but has a small piece if fish every once in a while.  I'm currently in the same boat where I'm slowly going vegan but have meat/dairy once in a while.  They made us feel very comfortable and constantly checked up on us/ cleared out empty plates throughout our meal.  When we returned and ordered take out, at least 3 servers came up to us to ask us if anyone has already helped us, even Chef came out to take a look outside and mentioned to us how great the weather was today.  Food was prepared and brought out to us quick and thanked us for coming by.  Our take out lunch specials were General Tzo chicken and the curry/potato chicken.

We were impressed with the service and the fact that both dishes tasted like it had meat but didn't have any in it.  We brought some left overs home for my husband to try it because he will only eat meat and he was impressed.  The Veggie House serves healthy food that's good for the body and soul!",

    "text": "Great place for vegans!! Everything is vegan! Overall very tasty and amazing flavors. Decent prices, lunch is cheaper $8.75 for selected dishes but smaller portions. Dinner is roughly $12. For someone who eats meat I can verify that this place is delicious!   1. Orange chicken: most famous and it's obvious why it's famous. Taste exactly like regular phage chicken. A must try!!   2. Spicy crispy eggplant: amazing flavor!!! Another popular choice. Taste and looks exactly like fries but healthier and tastier. Bit sweet and spicy and crunchy! Definitely eat it in the restaurant because it will get soggy if you take away.  3. Veggie pan fried noodles: AMAZING. Very hot (temperature), crispy, excellent gravy, and tons of veggies and sit shrimps. Another must try!   4. Curry tamarind fish with veggies: Nice curry taste but too sour for our liking. We ended up changing the order to regular curry and it was much better. The fish is soy and wrapped in seaweed for the \"fish\" taste. Not bad but not my favorite because of the tofu texture which throws off my taste buds.   5. Kung pao chicken: Excellent flavor! The soy chicken has a wonderful flavor being marinated in the sauce. Tons of veggies too. Another must try!  Overall, I will go again!",

    "text": "I absolutely, positively love this place!  Even if I'm in Vegas for only a few hours, I stop here before leaving.   I like to try different things every time I visit, but I always include the Orange Chicken, no matter what. It's so full of flavor & spice (they will alter the spice level to your liking), and it's cooked to a perfect crisp. I like it with brown rice. Orange Chicken is a must!  General Tso Chicken is good, just not as excellent as the Orange Chicken.   Kung Pao Beef is ok. It didn't do anything for me in the knock-my-flavor-socks-off department.   Spicy Hon Hon Shrimp is good. It's supposed to be crunchy, but mine wasn't. I think it would better with a crunchy batter.   It is a 100% vegetarian establishment, but everything I have had was vegan, and other dishes can be made vegan, just ask. Particularly if you're getting fried rice, otherwise, you'll get eggs in your food. So again, be sure to let them know if you're vegan.   Nice clean restaurant. Super friendly and helpful staff. Accepts credit cards (there is a minimum order amount; I think @ $6).   Call ahead for carry-out orders. To-go orders come in nice reusable containers.   Can be tricky to find for first time visitors. It's in Chinatown.  If you're coming from The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd), turn west onto Spring Mountain Rd. Stay on Spring Mountain Rd and once you pass Decatur Blvd, you'll see the Pacific Asian Plaza on your left. It's located on the 2nd level of the strip mall, west of the supermarket.",

Group ordered the General Tso Chicken, Orange Chicken, Beef nd Broccoli, Orange Beef and Lemon Duck. As a Vegan, I haven't had meat in a year, but the rest if the rest of the group are meat eaters.  As meat eaters they enjoyed the vegan meat. And as Chinese Americans, we all enjoyed the authenticity of the restaurant.  As a Vegan, I loved how there were so many options! I could literally order anything and everything off the menu! No need to read the menu, just point and you know it will be cruelty free!! Even the ice cream was Vegan. However, the meat was so realistic that it reminded me too much of meat. (Which can be both good and bad)  The staff was so friendly! Loved the waitresses! I am going back tomorrow it was so delicious! Great break from Vegas",

She ordered the wonton ramen soup & I ordered the lemon chicken. Both were so amazing we couldn't help but split our meals (which we rarely do). We also ordered the happy veggie roll and egg rolls and cucumber salad AND the banana pancake in order to taste as much of the menu as we could in one short stop. All deliciously approved!  It is so rare that we get to enjoy such authentic vegan cuisine, so thank you Chef Kenny and the awesome staff!

We will typically order several appetizers and share multiple plates of food. It's impossible to pick our favorite entree, so we eat family style. Everything we've tried is amazing! You seriously can't go wrong.   I would say the dishes we always get are Orange Chicken and Kung Pao, then we explore the menu, usually always getting something with \"beef.\" I'm not a big salad eater at restaurants, but Kenny's Spinach Salad is a surprisingly delicious start to your meal and we always make sure to order that first (FYI: It does have cilantro for those who don't enjoy it). I eat at a lot of vegan places, and Veggie House has MASTERED the plant-meats!! The \"meats\" are quite realistic in some cases, which can be a negative or positive for some people. But for us it's a special treat, and knowing that it's all plant-based fills our hearts with joy.   There is so much love in this restaurant as well, and it's meaningful that every time we come for dinner Kenny, the owner, is always making his rounds and saying hello. I just wish there was one where I live!  I say with confidence that both omnivores and plant-eaters will thoroughly enjoy a meal here.  Seriously, if you're in the area - try this place.  Kenny - PLEASE open a Veggie House in San Diego!!!!! :)",

They have a veggie meat ball that I'm curious about. I have a sunflower at home that has a delicious ball that tastes of cinnamon and cumin. Hard to find how to make so if soy and shiitake mushrooms are the real ingredients to what I have back home, then oh boy!!!  Ok the bathrooms are single and clean for the populated traffic. Staff was pleasant and checked up on us.  Can't wait to see them again :)",

    "text": "Vegetarian Chinese?! AKA I can finally eat Chinese food without worrying that I'm eating some shady chicken/fish from who knows where?  After eating at Veggie House I think I prefer vegetarian Chinese over regular Chinese. I've been here 3 times and it's been more consistent than I've ever experienced at another Chinese restaurant.  Veggie House is on the second floor of what I think is the #3 popping plaza of China Town. Park near the supermarket, it's almost directly over it. Parking in this lot isn't too bad compared to the other two popping plazas.  They have a top ordered picture menu (not Chef Kenny's specialties on the main menu) and those have been the best things I've had.  1. Orange chicken (on top ordered menu): Has a spicy chili mark, but it isn't spicy at all. The \"chicken\" is soft and outside crunchy. The ratio of crunch to \"meat\" was perfect. Bye bye Panda Express, this was on another level.  2. Kung Pao chicken (also on top ordered): Perfect ratio/consistency of \"chicken\" cashew red/green pepper. Not spicy, but watch the chilis inside! 3. Honey walnut shrimp: The \"shrimp\" was a little too gooey for me and turned me off from the dish. I guess it's not on the most ordered for a reason.  4. Spicy beef: Weird texture They have a Groupon $11 for $20 worth of food. You can't use it if you order on the Yelp24 take out app, but can use it on take out if you call the restaurant directly.",

I base my reviews on several issues, some being, friendliness, atmosphere, being clean, quality of food, value, and overall experience are several factors I consider.  I try and stay away from reviewing places that have been reviewed countless times and look to review more of the smaller what I call \"Mom and Pop\" type places.  I tend to look more for the positive and realize that many people's livelihood may depend on the  reviews.  I realize what some may like, others may not.  My reviews are  how I perceived the places I reviewed, and the experience I had.  The Veggie House is a great place to eat completely vegetarian by a Chef that has won many awards for his food.  Peggy, one of the servers, has my vote for one of the best people you could have taking care of you in Las Vegas.  I would rate the Veggie House a 9 out of 10 and highly recommend giving this place a try.",

We ordered a lot of food, but my favorites were the House Chow Mein, Walnut Shrimp, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant and Tofu, and the Sweet and Sour Soup. I really liked their Hot Jasmine Tea too.

I hate to write a bad review for a mostly vegan restaurant, but I really believe in unbiased reviews. That leads to my second issue. What's with a vegan restaurant that now serves vegan ice cream? Meaning, they have always served dairy ice cream but now offer vegan as well... that's just weird. How do I even know my ice cream has no dairy? Plus, it's not very good anyway. I had the gluten free, vegan chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and it was stale and tasteless.   I cannot recommend veggie house. I don't think they have a clue as to what gluten free means and I really don't trust that their food is 100% vegan. If it is, then I suppose the food is not fresh or was not washed/prepared properly and I will be violently ill tomorrow.",

You get good portions that feed 1-2 people just right.   The food comes out fast but everything is fresh and well made.   I'm not vegetarian but enjoy eating different non meat dishes. I enjoy the veggie beef and chicken a lot, it has flavor and texture is fair. I'm not a big fan of the shrimp but I don't really like shrimp anyway so that could just be me.   My favorite is the house pan fried noodles that has all 3 meats and several veggies. I just ask for no shrimp and easy peppers. I do wish there was more consistency on what veggies that go into this dish, sometimes I get celery and bok choy but other times one is missing or not very much. Don't be afraid to ask for what you like as they are nice and quick to help.   I'll certainly be back. I have brought other that were not vegetarian either and they were happy.   keep up the good work, thanks!",

While the food was generally tasty, I'm wondering exactly how much healthier it is here vs eating at any other \"regular\" chinese joint that serves meat.  I mean the food was for the most part tasty, but the sauces it was covered in were painfully sweet, sorry but there is just no way you could call this \"healthy\" eating which is one of the reasons to go vegetarian, right?  I'm not lying when I say I felt my health was worse after eating here.  Case in point...we ordered 3 dishes, Lettuce wraps, Orange \"chicken\", and General tzo's \"chicken\".  So for the \"chicken\" dishes, I'm not really sure what the faux chicken was made up of, maybe tofu? but whatever it was, it was covered in a thick batter (thicker than a normal chinese restaurant) and deep fried, then buried in a sauce that was basically liquid candy.  I cut a couple pieces in half and it was more than 50% batter, that can't be healthy.  The lettuce wraps were probably the healthiest of the 3 dishes and also the tastiest. The wraps, along with the side of rice, a mix of brown / wild rice, were the high points of the meal.  One other good thing that stood out was the service.  The servers were on it, refilling waters quickly and checking on us multiple times to make sure everything was O.K.. The restaurant itself was also very clean and inviting.  There is ample parking in the shopping complex and there's also a big asian market downstairs.  I doubt I'll be back to the Veggie House but I'll surely be back to the asian market.",

Super sweet wait staff, very happy and considerate. I liked the vibe in such positive energy. The food was delicious! They take a lot of pride in being vegan/ vegetarian. Winner! The Vegan Japanese Ramen and V Orange chicken were sooo good. Also, Thai tea didn't make me bloated and was not too sweet or sugary. Had a great time and will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "Veggie House is so impressive in that the menu is entirely vegetarian but some dishes truly taste like meat! It's rare to find a restaurant that executes this well. There are many that try, but not many succeed on a delicious dish.  Delicious fake meat isn't achieved just by a good sauce. It needs the texture and correct preparation for everything to be on point. This restaurant is a wonderful gem for vegans and non-vegans alike.   Service was attentive and I liked the green, tropical environment. It gave me asian spa oasis vibes. We got three roti with curry appetizer dishes, orange chicken lunch special and spicy beef lunch special. The roti with curry was so unique and delicious. The curry was really good. It had amazingly soft potatoes (I believe) enveloped in its goodness. The roti was soft and pulled apart easily. The orange chicken tasted exactly like orange chicken. What is this sorcery?! Honestly, if anything, it tasted better than most orange chickens I've tried (most certainly better than Panda Express). The sauce was tangy also. The spicy beef was delicious. This dish wasn't as believable as the orange chicken but still was really good. I really like the variety of \"meat\" options.   I feel like this is a good place for vegans to bring non-vegan friends and everyone will be happy!   P.S. this place has a 7% cash back for those who are enrolled in the yelp cash back program!",

Staying on the Las Vegas strip it is easy to get used to the hospitality and service given to you, but the hostess, waitress, and even  the chef at Veggie House outdid the entire strip.  The restaurant is very clean, well lit, and nicely decorated.  The background music and water fountains are extremely soothing.  Being from Hawaii I have eaten a lot of Chinese food, and being an eleven year vegan, I have eaten a lot of vegan food and Veggie House has the best of both! I went there three days in a row out of my five day vacation and would have gone more if my vacation was any longer.   Every item I tried, I loved,  from the crispy eggplant to the Buddha delight.  My mouth is watering just thinking about dining there again.  Even my non vegan date loved the food,  maybe even more than I did!   Also the mock meat dishes are so convincing, I am pretty sure you can bring a meat eater there and they wouldn't be the wiser.    On my next trip to Las Vegas I am going straight to Veggie House from McCarran Airport!  Thank you Veggie House!",

    "text": "A++ for the concept of this place alone. A vegetarian/vegan Chinese food lovers paradise. I looked up vegan friendly places before my visit to Vegas & this place popped up. I made it a MUST GO TO on my trip. Chinese/Asian food is pretty much my favorite type of food and it sucks that most places you go to don't have many veggie friendly options. It wasn't too far from the strip either, I'd say about 10 minutes max, and on the way you start to feel like your in an Asian country because you reach Chinatown and everything is Asian themed, so cool to see. Upon walking up the sign on the door was awesome lol \"no meat allowed\" inside the establishment, I'm like \"this is my type of restaurant.\" I decided to order to-go since I had a list of other adventures to get through before the day ended. The man at the register was so nice, the wait for my food was less than 10 minutes. The place was pretty busy too which makes me so happy to see. I ordered the General Tso's chikin and it was BOMB. Perfectly sweet and the side of white rice was cooked just right. My meat loving significant other was stealing my bowl and eating some too, he really liked it which says a lot. The portion for the price was a little less than I'd like because I paid about $13 for the one entree but I would definitely pay it all over again, it's worth it. Can't wait to come back to Vegas so I can return to this place and try some of their other dishes. I also saw that the owner is opening up a plant based drive through restaurant, I will definitely be trying that too on my next visit. Try this place if your in town, it's so worth it.",

Drink orders were taken, but after that it took forever to get the water and iced tea and even longer to get someone to take our order. We ordered the 4 Item Cold Dish Combo with \"BBQ Meat\", Spring Roll, Seaweed Salad, & Fried Wonton. For $13.00 this was very tiny portions which were overall good but I was still hungry afterwords! He ordered the walnut \"shrimp\" and it was decent as well but again the portion was small. After we got our food, no one ever came back to check on us or even refill our drinks! We sat there trying to get someones attention for quite a long time. Our waitress finally came over and did not apologize she just asked us if we wanted desert, we declined and then asked for the check. After we gave her cash, we waited on our change for what seemed like another eternity. Needless to say, the food may have been worth going back since all of our friends like this place, but service like that makes me not want to ever come back.",

    "text": "Of all the vegan restaurants in Las Vegas Veggie House is my absolute favorite. First of all the food is delicious. Not only is everything vegan but authentically prepared and tastes just as amazing as many of the Chinese restaurants nearby. I found the ambience to be charming with gazebos for larger parties and a little waterfall/pond feature. The staff were attentive and courteous. The crowd was diverse. I will definitely come back over and over again. Don't skip this gem!",

An issue on the end of them or groupon i dont know,  but, what i do know is that they made no effort in trying to resolve the issue. Please, i warn you, both local and visiting persons, do not patronize this establishment. Its a complete waste of time.",

We have been here a few times and always go there for at least one meal when in Vegas.  While we have thought of trying other vegetarian places but given this one has been consistent each time, didn't venture at other places yet.  Even though it's a busy plaza, we have never had parking issue or had to circle around to get one.  Since there is a grocery store, there is constant movements and spots open up right away.

    "text": "This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  Perhaps the best.  And I am saying that as an extreme critic and chef myself.  Unlike any restaurant I have ever been to, the staff knows everything about every ingredient on the menu.  What it is, what its made of if its a processed vegan meat, what allergies it could effect (if you don't eat corn or what, etc).  They know about all the recipes and can tell you all about them.  And they are super passionate about what they do.  They want to share this information with you.  Unlike many waitresses who find it a hassle to be quizzed about how things are made and what goes into them.  These waitresses are happy and eager to share this information with you  Now lets get into what you will eat here.  What you will find here is one of the very few authentic asian cuisine restaurants in the United States.  They make all sorts of hardcore asian dishes.  Like shark fin soup.  Or roast goose.  But guess what?  THEYRE ALL 100% VEGAN!!!  Yes thats right, 100% vegan goose meat!  Made out of vegetables!  Even on the door there is a sign that says \"no animal products may enter this premises\"  But don't worry meat eaters!  This place is amazing!  Everything tastes super great!  The chef here is a world famous chef!  I even brought my father there who is a meat and potatos kind of american guy.  You know the type.  hes an old fashioned macho farmer, grew up on a dairy farm.  And even he loved it!  And he wasn't just being polite!  Hes teh kind of guy who will say if he doesn't like something.  And when he was looking at the menu he wasn't sure about any of the dishes, didn't think they were the kinds of things he would like.  So he just let me order and he ended up likeing everything!  And the atmosphere is really nice here, but still casual, not stuffy.  And the owner actually came around to introduce himself and make sure we felt welcome, just like good restaurant owners used to.  He was a very friendly and personable man.  He spoke with us for about 2-3 minutes and I will always remember that.    This is a restaurant experience you really shouldn't miss if you are in vegas.  It is a real treat.",

Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Spicy Crispy Beef with Broccoli are a must. Turmeric Salad and Crispy Spicy Eggplant are also good. Lunch specials are awesome with a lot of food for the price. I always get three lunch specials(take-out) which is way cheaper, and then you have amazing veggie meat for days. Just don't forget to ask for extra soy sauce packets. Rice without soy sauce or Braggs is pretty rough. Note: Parking lot is a little tight, and you have to walk up the stairs to get to the front entrance. *Lunch time can get pretty crazy in there, so if you're picking up, you might have to peek your head in the seating area and flag them down. Otherwise, you might be waiting awhile. *FYI, the owner just opened up another plant based restaurant, Vegeway, which specializes in awesome burgers, sandwiches, vegan milkshakes, etc. And the coolest part, there's a drive thru! Aw man, how long I've been waiting for something like this to exist.",

Finding a place to eat can be tough because I want to eat delicious food and they want to eat vegetarian -- usually, you have to pick one. Not the case with Veggie House.

So perfect, and they have it as an $8 lunch special with a side of rice. Even better, the chef is from San Diego like me.

Once they reopened their doors as Veggie House I bookmarked it immediately, but it wasn't until the Groupon became available that I got just the right push to get me here.   My Groupon was just about to expire, so I decided to pick up a meal for my fella and I for carryout. I ordered over the phone and the service was so friendly and informative when I had questions about the menu. I came in after work and my food was ready to go. The ladies who worked here were really nice and I was really impressed with the pleasant service.   I got our meal home and I actually had to wait a bit before my fella got home. I couldn't resist and snuck a bite from each of the dishes before he arrived. Everything was oh so good. I couldn't believe how much the General Tso's \"Chicken\" tasted and felt just like actual chicken. My fella was especially reluctant, but I made him give it a chance. He was absolutely blown away how good it all was. My favorite was the spicy crispy eggplant and the green beans. The eggplant was spicy and delicious. Even better, they offer brown rice instead of white for no extra fee.   Despite my carnivorous tendencies, I am quite the veggie addict, so I was thrilled with the food here. I can't wait to make this place a regular on our restaurant rotation for their veggie options. I'll probably skip the faux meat next time.",

    "text": "While planning a trip to Vegas, I reached out to Vegas Yelper and vegetarian Julie K. for some vegan friendly recommendations. Not only did she suggest restaurants but she also suggested we meet up for dinner. Hell yeah!  The thought of vegan friendly Chinese food intrigued me and my Chinese meat eater BF. But I knew we were in good hands since Julie K., who is an absolute sweetheart btw, frequents this place enough to have a favorite waitress. We started off with some yummy Fried Veggie Dumplings (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F2v47Ih&s=9f9588c96f12ffef97c6f5581af3304db2748998215c09825c9632e363f5723e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/2v47Ih</a> ) while we sipped on Thai Iced Tea.  They have a very extensive menu (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beyondmenu.com%2F25320%2FLas-Vegas%2FVeggie-House-Las-Vegas-89146.aspx%3Fr%3D25320&s=b77600e969ba5c033dd29c1389b1a747fe46eda2c22d035addb8c13c58a0f8a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">beyondmenu.com/25320/Las...</a> ) I wanted to order something that I knew I couldn't order at a regular Chinese restaurant. I was craving something \"beefy\" with curry. They have \"chicken\" curry on the menu but when I asked the waitress if they have a \"beef\" curry dish, her response was \"We can make you one!\" Whoa, really!?! They will just invent dishes at your request!!! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F1Rhxts&s=eb2499b87c015b79772ee16fa782f37c81559ca820b206b7929640293b32e01d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/1Rhxts</a>  When she brought it out, she informed me that this was the first time they made this dish. So we're kinda special being the first ones with a beef curry dish :) The vegan beef was mixed with all kinds of hearty veggies. It was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as our other dishes: Yee Shang Eggplant and the Salt & Pepper Fried Tofu. The eggplant dish was cooked perfectly soft and covered in a spicy sweet sauce (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F26qrg4&s=83516e28769facba11dbeb5aaee94b95b7ed7564fa2321ad2ba23c58e59a09db\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/26qrg4</a> ). The tofu dish had this light batter and fried perfectly crispy seasoned with just enough salt & pepper. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F2UtvSh&s=937b97bfca96351ceffb5989a6bb946c72f9874d40d37f4150ab908559753a34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/2UtvSh</a>  At the end of our dinner, I was sad that I didn't have room for the Vegan Fried Ice Cream. Looks like I'm gonna have to venture off strip again for my next Vegas trip. This is one of those places I can definitely see myself revisiting a few more times and eventually updating this review to five stars. So many menu items I want to taste! But I'm definitely a fan and would give this place 4.5 stars if I could :)  Major thanks to Julie K. for the awesome restaurant recommendation and generously sharing her Groupon to Veggie House with us! :)",

During our visit the chef came out and was very polite and friendly.   Our table of 3 ordered and shared 3 different plates as well as some apps. Everything was excellent. I would recommend to anyone who ventures off the strip or is looking for excellent veggie food while in Vegas. I will definitely be back.",

I HIGHLY recommend taking the Elevator instead of the steps because it can be dangerous taking the steps.....LOL!!!! Parking is a BEAR.....so keep that in mind if you should try to visit this location. The Food....service and price were all very good. I had the vegetable Fried rice and it was very good....and considering this was a Veggie/Vegan establishment I was very impressed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

    "text": "Third time eating at this place.  Same server the first time and the last time.  She swore up and down pointing animatedly at the numerous dishes on the menu that were gluten free. I'll return to that in a minute.   First off, the king pao chicken is disgusting, it tastes burnt and is just not good.  Their \"sizzling chicken\" a Chinese version of fajitas , equally as bland and unappetizing.  I made the mistake of ordering their ramen because I was in a random mood for it.. the noodles were shot out, there was waaaaaaay to much broth, it had these tasteless soggy fried \"things\" in it, and .... corn.. will never order again.  So the previous times we are there we left with such bad headaches from the pounds of sugar in their sauces and my co-diner with an extreme stomach ( indication she had consumed gluten)     Which brings me to our third and last ever visit.  Turns out all their food has gluten in it.   They're unwilling or simply unable to adjust the dishes sans gluten. Which leaves you with two options, one being that sizzling chicken.  A good concept for a restaurant , the food just sucks.  Step it up chef Kenny !",

For a Chinese restaurant it's also extremely clean and well maintained.   For lunch I ordered the Buddhas delight (Jai), \"fish\" with tofu and vegetables, and spicy tofu (vegan mapo tofu). Lunch is served with soup and choice of brown or white rice.  Vegans can request the special dishes from Chef Kenny be made without egg.   The servings during lunch may seems small but they were just right for me.  There is plenty of parking underground and at the same level of the restaurant on the west side of the center.   I will definitely returning on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

Their sister location VegeWay is by far my favorite vegan restaurant in the SW area! Who am I kidding it's really good but Wynn has better options. For the price, looking for fast, cheap, vegan food.

We both sat there wondering how they got away with so little oil while making it crisp and still fluffy inside The yellow curry that came with was pretty decent as well.  Crispy Beef - this was hard to tell this was soy beef aside it from not having any kind of strong beefy flavor. They know how to fry up something crispy here as the sauce never made the crisp outside sog AT ALL and it was not a greasy dish either. I wish every Chinese restaurant knew the Veggie House secret.  5 Vegetable Delight - this was subtle, but solid vegetables. The sauce is a light soy and ginger and it had lotus root, mustard, mushrooms (black fungus and shiitake), snap peas, carrots and cashews.   We ate everything up but didn't feel overly stuffed or get that \"itis\" you get when you just eat some filling, fatty, salty stuff. Definitely not feel guilty food at all.   I'm glad there is a place like this around. My own caveat is for a place that is \"Veggie House\" there wasn't many JUST vegetable dishes there, but I digress. I'm just not keen on fake meats, but that beef was good.   Service here is pretty good. Checking on us and drinks were refilled and didn't stay empty very long which is much appreciated on a hot summer day.   Must come if you're vegetarian/ vegan , definitely worthy even if you're not. The uncommon meat substitutes are definitely a foodie adventure in their own right.",

The chef came by randomly and asked us if we wanted to try a taro cake (?) he was working on (for free, just to see what we thought of it), and he seemed to just love making food and making people happy.",

    "text": "This place was ABSOLUTELY amazing. Coming from a non-vegan, i could eat here everyday and never feel like im missing meat. All of their \"meat\" is pretty much some magical version of tofu. It was so convincing it almost made my very vegan friend uncomfortable. The service was spectacular to say the least.  My friend and I got: a pot of decaf green tea- $1.50 Chow Mein- Comes with all \"Meats\" (beef, chicken, shrimp) didn't care for the texture of the shrimp too much, but the flavor wasn't bad. The most convincing of all of the tofu meats was the chicken. I truly could not tell the difference AT ALL. Usually i shy away from show mein since it is such a simple and basic noodle dish. I can confidently say that was not the case with this one. It was piping hot, full of sauce, and jam packed with flavor.  Crispy fried eggplant: OMG this was something else, man. This was one of the best dishes i've had in a long time. Our waitress says they call it \"Chinese French Fries\" and it is even better tasting than the picture. They're nice and crispy covered in a beautiful teriyaki style sauce. You wont want to stop eating these lemme tell ya. Cherry Chocolate Ice cream - yes VEGAN! You can tell how fresh this ice cream is after the first bite. You can see small inconsistencies in how they mix in the cherries (but i like that) SO YUMMY.  Vegan or not, TRY THIS PLACE OUT. If you like yummy delicious food, that is.",

    "text": "My 3 stars are for the service, alone. We were very pleased with how attentive, friendly & helpful our servers were. The food on the other hand, was disappointing & pretty bland in our opinion. And I really wanted to love this place (being vegan & all). We still had a great time because the service was great. I don't mean to sound offensive - but I thought the servers were just adorable in their button up shirts & bow ties, they even use fresh table cloths which my chef bf really loved ;) Oh - & I thought it was so sweet how the male server \"asked\" if I wanted a straw rather than just giving me one. Huge points there for being eco-conscious!! I just personally think its a bit overpriced & overhyped for the food you're getting.   My veggie chick'n chow mein wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It was super greasy & only came with peppers for veggies. I was expecting more flavor (given that its chow mein), & also expected some \"mixed\" veggies, but it was more like a chinese lo mein. No biggie, but the \"chickn\" made it pretty bad. It was super rubbery & had this really bizarre taste that I find with a lot of meat alternatives. Just tasted like fake, processed, cooked rubber that I shouldn't be eating.Totally should've just stuck with tofu. If you're a picky vegan (like myself), who misses the taste of real chicken, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about! Lol I guess I should have ordered the orange chicken, like the server recommended, but this is precisely why I'm always scared to order any \"meat\" alternatives.  The tom yum soup wasn't too bad, but again, pretty bleh other than the ginger they put on top of it (that was the only real flavor imo). And again, just peppers??? Seriously -  If I knew they just put peppers on everything I would have specified \"no peppers\" lol However - the shrimp was VERY impressive! Couldn't believe how similar it was to vegan shrimp!! My meat eating bf who despises vegan food was even eating it!! So bravoooo for the shrimp!!   The happy roll was ok, not spectacular but tasty enough to finish, although I certainly don't think it's worth the $8.25. The happy roll was probably my fav out of all 3 dishes.  Overall - I was very pleased with their service & the fact that the ENTIRE MENU is VEGAN! (Server's words). I think those two factors alone are hard to come by & make a place worth coming to. But, considering I'm an incredibly picky vegan that loves my savory dishes, & my bf is an incredibly picky meat eater, we'll probably be skipping this one in the future. Lol Thanks, Veggie House. We'll miss you. xo",

    "text": "I'm what you could call vegan-skeptical. I tried going vegetarian in high school and couldn't hack it. I dated someone who encouraged me to eat less meat, tried vegan cheese (amongst other things), and thought it was okay but couldn't stick with it or afford it.  Enter Veggie House. Any time I've looked up places to eat in my neighborhood, it shows up at the top. I've seen it listed at or near the top of \"best in Vegas\" restaurant roundups. After months of passing it by in favor of other places to try, I finally gave it a go this past weekend. With my expectations set so high, Veggie House couldn't possibly rise to the occasion. Right?  I'm happy to say I couldn't have been more wrong. Veggie House takes every preconceived notion one might hold about vegan food and demolishes it with unfussy, flat-out phenomenal cuisine. I tried the House Chow Fun with vegan chicken, beef, and shrimp, and while the beef didn't quite come all the way to tasting like the real thing, the chicken and shrimp were downright indistinguishable from their \"real\" counterparts. The gluten-free selection is impressive for a diet choice challenging for Celiacs and the prices aren't bad for a vegan restaurant.  Bottom line: Veggie House is as good as the reviews claim and I can't wait to return.",

I'll give you rundown on the top five G.O.A.T (greatest of all time) items on the menu.  1. General Tzo Chicken  2. Roti with Curry 3. Mongolian Beef/Beef & Broccoli (tie) 4. Strawberry Cheesecake  5. Hon Hon Shrimp  I really enjoy coming here with a large party because you get to dine under the little canopy tables. To me, it adds to the entire dining experience.   I've had my fair share of Chinese restaurants throughout the Las Vegas Valley, but Veggie House outshines them all. The entire staff is delightful - from the servers to the owner. They never disappoint regardless of if I dine in or place a carry out order.   Veggie House is so much more than just a meat parody. You will not be disappointed, and you'll question if you actually ordered vegan food.",

I also like to mention I found a great deal on Groupon for this place... $20 worth of food for $11.... cha Ching! We ordered the spicy fish dish, the sizzling shrimp dish, And Japanese ramen. And of course your meal comes with either white rice or brown rice so we settled for the brown rice. And what is Chinese food without hot tea? The ramen was delicious. Miso based with lots of ramen and very tasty. The sizzling shrimp plate was full of shrimps and veggies. Simply delicious! The spicy fish dish I didn't quite enjoy as much because it had this tangy flavor which I didn't too much care for. My overall impression you ask? I liked it. It was very satisfying and I'd love to go back and try some other dishes.",

But, as in Vegas, there's everything to eat under the sun.  We did a little Yelp search and found Veggie House.   The group of five of us begrudgingly went kicking and screaming at the whim of the one on the vegan diet.  We had NO idea what to expect......  We often go up Spring Mountain for good Asian cuisine.  We haven't been disappointed yet.   Veggie House was awesome!  It's located upstairs in a building full of other restaurants.   We went during lunch hour - not too busy, which translated to exceptional service.  We always had a full glass of water, plates cleared immediately as we finished and a full pot of tea for the table.  The service was friendly and superb.  We ordered a lot of dishes to be served family style.  As appetizers, we ordered house veggie soup, fried veggie dumplings, happy rolls and lettuce wraps.   Main dishes we tried Kung Pao V Chicken, Spicy Veggie Crispy Beef, Crispy Spicy Eggplant, Buddha Delight and Veggie Roast Pork.  The meal came with a selection of white or brown rice.  We chose brown.   All I can say is WOW!   The food was completely amazing with a depth of flavors.  You would never know that it was all vegan! 100% meatless!  How do they do it?!   They had the \"meat\" textures just right - right down to the grooves on the beef.  With every bite, we all looked at each other around the table in sheer bewilderment at how wonderfully savory the flavors and textures were.    Our vegan friend smiled from her plate and said:  \"See, I told you so!\"  We all looked at her and agreed.   Veggie House would be a great option for Lent!",

I ordered the roti with curry, Kung Pao chicken, and the spring rolls. There is a huge lack of communication from staff. Four different people came up to us to figure out whether we were picking up an order for carry out, dining in, or if we were delivery drivers... They also took forever to make the food. I think I'm going to switch to Chef Kenny's, his food is very flavorful and I think it's quite a bit better. The customer service is also way better.",

    "text": "Veggie House is located on the 2nd floor above the SF supermarket. It was pretty packed when we arrived on a Friday night but there was no wait luckily! We ordered the Thai Tea, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Crispy Beef, and Braised Tofu with Veggies.   - The Thai Tea was pretty good and unique with the soymilk added to it. Guess it's good for those who are lactose intolerant x)  - Honey Walnut Shrimp - I was pretty impressed that the shrimp actually tasted and had the texture like shrimp! I liked this dish a lot!  - Crispy Beef - probably my least favorite dish. It was just fried goodness but not much substance. The broccoli it came with was also a bit cold. - Braised Tofu with Vegetables - Braised Tofu has been my all time favorite dish ever since I was a kid so I was looking forward to eating this.  The tofu was cooked correctly and everything was very fresh. I think the flavor was a bit underwhelming for me though. Maybe I'm just too used to the amazing flavors of vegetarian food back at the temples in SoCal though.   The service was very welcoming and friendly! Although, there was an awkward moment where a server came up to our table and excitedly showed us a new fish dish and we thought he was going to give it to us for free. After he tempted us, he left to give it to another table.  It was too good to be True lol.   Overall, I thought Veggie House was decent but nothing out of this world like many of the reviews state. Each dish was about $11-13 so it wasn't super cheap either. But if you're interested about Vegan Chinese food, go for it!",

The \"chicken\" lettuce wraps are great, the sauce is tangy and the lettuce is always fresh and crisp. I also love the crispy spicy eggplant and the orange \"chicken\" has the best texture and flavor- always satisfies my craving.   The atmosphere is lovely and serene, with plants and waterfalls throughout the dining area. They also have a great round table for large groups.   Highly recommend!",

Their restaurant is small but comfortable, perfect for small gatherings of 4-5. Their staff was on point and very knowledgeable about their food. The food was to die for, it was cooked to perfection and was very generous with its portion sizes. Veggie House is a great choice to go to if you're in town for a weekend or a local.",

The waitress assigned to our table was pleasant and quickly brought our drinks when she had a minute. We ordered 2 lunch specials-crispy beef and vegetables in tamarind sauce. The vegetarian crispy beef tasted really good and the vegetables in tamarind sauce was ok.  The lunch special comes with rice or bun and the good thing is that they don't charge extra for brown rice.

Today I was in a fairly weird mood and couldn't quite decide on what I wanted but I love to wander into places. I stopped in this shopping mall and wandered through a couple places before I finally decided on Veggie House. When I looked at the menu the price was right and the options sounded more like what I was hungry for on a cold day.  I walked in and was quickly seated. The server quickly got my drink order and I had a big pot of green tea to warm me up. I decided on the General Tzo chicken, which is not really chicken but I'm ok with that. It came with a yummy house soup that was this tasty celery broth that I could have eaten a gallon of, but luckily just had the cup. Not long after I finished that up the server promptly brought out my \"chicken\" and brown rice. It was the perfect lunch size and I ate the whole thing happily. Even though it was fried, the \"chicken\" was greasy and the sauce was tasty.  The grand total for lunch and green tea was less than $9 so score one for an affordable, quick, tasty lunch.  I would definitely go back here and try some of their other dishes. If you are looking for vegetarian or not, Veggie House is definitely a great restaurant in Chinatown.",

    "text": "Volunteering brings out the hungry beast in us Yelpers. So it was only natural for Jade W., Christie O., and I to venture off for lunch after doing some community service. I had been eating like a glutton over the past couple weeks and vegetarian sounded good to me.   Between the three of us, we got the crispy eggplant, fish curry, and mapo tofu. Still to this day, the one dish that stands out in my memory is the first dish. It was fantastic. I would have been happy with just eating this by itself. The \"fish\" in the curry was made of bean curd and seaweed to give it a fishy taste. I was initially put off by it because it felt like I was biting into a sponge. Once I got past the textural issues, it did not taste bad at all. I am curious about their other meat substitutes. Nowadays, imitation chicken and beef has come a long way.   Veggie House might not be the first place to come to mind when I think Chinatown, but it is not on the no go list. It does not hurt to go for lunch when each plate only costs $6.50. The specials are diverse and has something for everyone. Well, anyone who does not mind meat free meals.",

    "text": "I can't believe it's not meat!  I've had some vegan meats before but if not executed correctly it can be bland and the texture can be a little unappetizing. I'm glad I've found a place where I can indulge myself with Chinese food and feel healthy at the same time. My brother and I tried this place out since Shuseki was still closed (around 4:30pm) and we were famished. Knowing he's a bit of a health buff I told him I knew that there was a Vegan/Vegetarian place in the same plaza. *I know that Hue Thai also serve imitation meat but I forgot about that until now.  My brother ordered their barbequed pork appetizer and I got the salt and pepper fried fish. We ordered these to really test this place out. When our food arrived I was almost confused since the dishes really looked like the \"original.\" His bbq pork didn't have any hint of \"I'm not really meat\" texture. If I didn't know it was vegan meat I would assume it's the real deal.   My fried fish entree surpassed my expectations. At first it really looked like fried fish, with it's crispy and salty outside. The inside has the texture of tofu which could be troubling for some but I was blown away by the flavor instead. It seriously tasted like fish (not the texture, but still). The chef knew how to work with the ingredients. He knew how to manipulate certain aspects of a dish to really make the vegan meat taste like \"real\" meat. They also offer brown rice.   The service was nice. One of the waitress has a strong accent so it might be difficult to converse with her but she's patient and wouldn't mind repeating herself. She even gave us suggestions.   The one thing that bothered my brother was that when we paid, the hostess lady took the liberty to keep all the change. We had $6 and something cents worth of change and we planned on tipping $3 (that's 15%, I'm sure) and he can't believe that they'd assume the rest was theirs to keep. I know it's an honest mistake but just a heads up to businesses, make sure to bring the change and wait for the tip after. We promise we won't jip you.",

I have been a vegan for quite some time, and struggling to have my girlfriend join. Finding Veggie House was pure fate. Service was fast and friendly, food was delicious, and prices were affordable! As soon as we entered, we were seated right away. We had ordered the miso soup, orange chicken, roast pork, and chow fun dishes. All the dishes were full of flavor and every morsel was better than the last. I don't know how Chef Kenny does it, but the chicken tastes just like chicken, it's uncanny! The only constructive criticism I would give is that they invest in a soda dispenser, instead of soda cans. Also, the decorations are a bit cheesy and old. It would be more appealing if they went more modern, simple, and cozy. But that has no effect on the food and service, which is very exceptional in all aspects! This is our first visit, and most certainly not our last!",

The location is in one of the large Asian shopping centers along Spring Mountain.  They definitely try to make the customer feel welcome and have tried their hands at soothing decor, but the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired. The food is pretty good especially the items on the specials. They are seasoned amazingly well. The one dish that turned out less than desirable was the Buddah's Delight. It was quite plain and the veggies a little over cooked.  The proprietor is very welcoming and brings samples around for tasting so you can see all the other delicious items you could be eating. It definitely gives you and idea of what to order next time!  I hope Vegas continues to foster quality vegetarian restaurants like this.",

    "text": "By far best Vegan restaurant in Las Vegas! It is really hard to find such gems as these as Vegas isn't exactly a vegan friendly city. There are good places, yes but this place definitely will trick a carnivore into thinking they just had some beef right off of the hibachi. When I first tried it, I ordered orange beef to go and when I got home, I opened the box and was confused because it looked like beef so I stared at it for a while just to make sure. After much hesitation, I bit a piece of it and spit it right back out before I was so certain I had eaten beef. I would have been sick after not eating red meat in years. I had to look online about this place again just to be sure and was absolutely amazed. My boyfriend is not a vegetarian and took a bite out of my food out of complete curiosity and thought the same as I did. After explaining it was all soy product, he was completely surprised and now wants to go eat with me. I'm not trying to turn him into a vegan but it is nice to go to a restaurant that we both can enjoy. I did not give 5 stars however because I wasn't impressed with the service. I've only been there twice and both times, they seemed to have ignored me and my wait time was much longer than expected especially for calling in my orders ahead of time to pick up. But other than that, I'm absolutely in love with this place and will be back as a regular! :D",

Very polite and cheerful staff.       The atmosphere inside the restaurant was pleasant with a small waterfall and some little electronic chirping birds (which, upon first hearing, led me to believe some real birds got stuck inside. But no worries they're not real ;).       We ordered: crispy eggplant, walnut shrimp, general tzo chicken, and spicy fried beef as well as their hot-and-sour soup.       Each dish was delicious although I wouldn't recommend ordering the eggplant and beef together due to their seasoning similarities. Soup had a little too much thickener, but was still tasty.       I did not order the Thai iced tea, but sampled some from my party. It was tasty as well.       I would definitely recommend the place for vegetarians as well as curious carnivores.        With our order we had to box quite a bit, entree portions were larger and I would have  dropped maybe 2.       One thing though, be prepared for a small strip mall parking lot and a dirty elevator.",

    "text": "I hate to do this, but I have to be the first non 4 or 5 star review for Veggie House.  With an average of 5 stars and a new placement atop my \"Best Match\" list here on Yelp, I was finally tempted to call in a take-out order.   In going through what I could see of the menu in the pics here combined with my fear of vegan \"meat\", I decided upon the highly lauded Crispy, Spicy eggplant lunch special with brown rice and a regular iced tea to drink.  They told me 10 minutes it'd be ready (fast!) and I probably got there 15 minutes after.  It's upstairs?  Minus one star.  Just kidding, but I am lazy so I took the elevator.  It took them a short while to realize I was at the front waiting, but not crazily long and they apologized so no harm done (I also didn't try to flag them down or anything), and I paid for the meal (reasonable at $9 for food and drink combined) and left.  First thing I noticed which was odd was that it was all bagged up, even the iced tea.  I can understand the thinking that it could be more convenient to carry it this way, but when I got to the car I immediately went to remove it because I don't like my hot and cold items so close to each other when I get takeout.  I then noticed that the tea was in a gigantic soup container, and not a normal takeout cup, meaning it was very wide and the lid did not have an opening for a straw.  Given it's width it wouldn't fit in my cupholders so right back into the bag it went.  You win this round Veggie house.  On the plus side it contained a LOT of tea, and I've never been more AMPED to work on Excel spreadsheets on a Friday afternoon in my life.  In getting to work I was a little disappointed when unpacking the bag to find that there was simply the rice and eggplant (and the tea) inside.  The menu states it is served with a daily soup and also lists a \"Bun Roll\" and some sort of sweet potato rice but now I can see how that might be part of an option I could have chosen instead of the brown rice?  Alright look, I still could have used some soup, and they CLEARLY have to go soup containers.  I know several places make those sort of lunch special components dine-in only, but I didn't see any mention of that being the case here so I was still sad about it.     As for the eggplant and brown rice, they tasted really great as others have mentioned, but I have a big issue with the eggplant being called spicy because there was ZERO HINT OF SPICINESS whatsoever.  On a scale of 1-10 it was literally a 1 if not a zero.  It was much more sweet than spicy which was a disappointment for me as I love spice.  I'm not sure if I should have specified that I wanted it really spicy, or if my understanding of vegan spice is too limited to understand the deal, but I didn't feel like I ultimately got what I wanted.  The flavors were still nice, and I would definitely give Veggie House another try in the future.   Maybe by then they'll have to-go cups?",

    "text": "If you are looking for bland, unexciting, poor substitutes for \"the real thing\".......this is NOT the place for you!  My husband and I are BIG Chinese food eaters and decided to give Veggie House a try during a meat-free weekend.  Our simple hope was that it would be edible, and we would have been thrilled if it had only been a passable alternative to animal-based Chinese.  Veggie House completely exceeded our expectations!  We had the Spring Rolls, Lettuce Wraps, Hot and Sour Soup and Kung Pao V Chicken.  Each course was tasty, fresh and distinct.  The flavors and textures were amazing mimics of some of the better meat-based Chinese dishes we have had and would easily fool someone who wasn't told in advance that no flesh would be consumed.  The menu is as dense as any good Chinese restaurant and the owner insisted we try his \"goose\" and \"duck\" the next time we visit because in his words they are \"awesome!\" In addition to the great food, the pride of ownership is unmistakeable and an all too rare quality in many restaurants.  We listened in on a conversation the owner had with another table and then spoke with him ourselves and learned of what a strong passion he has for introducing more people to great vegetarian eating.  The decor is lovely and our server seemed genuinely pleased with our enjoyment of the meal.  This is the type of place that makes it soooo much easier to go meatless by offering up truly delicious choices.",

She said if I didn't like it she would take it back and bring me something else.  The lotus cakes were delicious.  I'm not sure exactly what they were made of, but it included round slivers of lotus root with a coating of some kind of protein on one side (TVP?), fried with a tasty brown sauce.  As stated in other reviews, the service is excellent here.  The waitress asked me how I liked the food, which is actually pretty unusual at a Chinese restaurant.  Then the cook came out and asked everybody how they liked the food.  They really care about what they're doing at the Veggie House.  This would be a good restaurant to visit with a group so that you can try many different dishes family style.  Next time I will bring some friends with me.",

Gardein Chikn is listed as chicken.  I wanted something that was heavy on vegetables and asked for a dish they recommended.  The waitress seemed to be in a hurry and said braised tofu with vegetables.  Disappointment awaited me...  The braised tofu with vegetables was made with the softest tofu I've every seen. Absolutely brutal. There were about 3 different kinds of vegetables, mainly bok choy.  Would have expected to get some more variety  Now we get to the sauce, which I asked to be extra spicy.  For a vegan restaurant, I noticed the place was full of overweight people and now I know why.  Everything is covered in sugar sauce and comes with only white rice.  Not much spice was detected in the sugar sauce.   Maybe I expected too much from this place, based on the glowing reviews.  I think people are just getting mesmerized by the fact it is all vegan. There is a chance I'd go back and try something else, but the food didn't really look healthy.  More of a place for people that are vegans for ethical reasons and not dietary concerns.",

    "text": "It's upstairs in the same plaza as the SF Supermarket on Decatur & Spring Mountain (even though Yelp maps indicated Jones & Sahara). The inside is VERY nice looking. Decently sized and with the amazing decorations inside, it makes me want to bring in a group of 8 and sit under one of the designated family-style tables.  Service was prompt except it wasn't busy at all so they had a lot of time to go to us in the beginning. By the end, though, they stopped coming over as often. They were nice and helpful and I was also reading the Yelp reviews to see what was recommended.  WHAT WE ORDERED: 2 cold items combo $6.95: seaweed stem & cucumber -- This wasn't too shabby. I definitely liked the cucumber. Maybe not so much the seaweed but it wasn't too bad. The sauce was nice :0).  Salt Pepper Fried Tofu -- I love mostly everything salt & pepper so I really wanted to taste it. It was pretty good and my friend liked it. We also dipped it in other sauces but I preferred soy sauce. You can slightly taste the salt & pepper so it wasn't that strong for me.  Veggie beef rolls -- Last year I had an influx of beef rolls so I definitely think this played into my taste buds. They were good in their own way but a bit too soft for me. And of course, the meat isn't really our typical meat, since it's faux meat, but it wasn't too shabby. If you're a fan of beef rolls, I would recommend you trying. I tried it due to a yelp review but I've since stopped eating beef rolls. Had enough to last me a few years :0b.  During your lunch/dinner, you might have a few chirping birds around ;). Beware, haha!  I'll definitely be back!",

We also ordered our favorite Thai ice tea which was made with soymilk and was much less sweet than we get at our local thai restaurant. We ordered the buns as a side, and it was not what we expected.. (we thought steamed buns but it was more of a harder bread, I would not order it again). I also liked the appetizer soup, it had great flavor and many vegetables. If you are vegetarian or like a flavorful light lunch, I would highly recommend this place.",

A vegan friend recommended this place after recently telling him that my husband and I were on a mission to eat healthier. With that said, we are fairly new to the world of vegan diet and have not done much research on it. When it comes to honey or sugar, I HAD no knowledge of why vegans refuse to consume it due to certain ethical concerns. Innocently  and politely I asked a waitress (wore glasses...)for honey for my tea and she responds \"Uhh we are vegannnn...\" in a rather condescending tone. Instead of explaining to the customer why they don't have it or stopping to consider that people who dine there may not all be 100% vegan, she walks away leaving this impression that she was highly offended, as if I just asked for a steak or hotdog, which came off rude/disrespectful. She never returned to check on us during our meal nor did other servers in the restaurant. Everyone at the table agreed that we didn't get the service we all were expecting. Perhaps her reaction was due to lack of communication skills since her English seemed limited but she certainly could've at least tried harder to accommodate the customer's request by offering alternative options or just not act snooty at all. Needless to say, none of my family members or myself will ever return to this place.",

I ordered the curry with roti and general tso's chicken. I ordered the curry based off yelp reviews and my fellow yelper's did not disappoint! The roti was perfectly soft and the curry is definitely in my top four best curry's ever. Now let's get to the 'chicken'. I took a bite and was really worried because it tasted exactly like chicken, even the texture.. I had my phone flashlight on this piece of chicken for a solid 3 mins examining it..I was waiting for the indigestion to come and researching more yelp to assure myself that this was vegan, my worry turned to pure excitement because my stomach felt fine and I had found a vegan Chinese spot that tastes better (in my opinion) than regular Chinese.

If you just walked up from the street and had no idea this was a vegetarian place, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  We felt we cheated on our pescatarian diet after eating here.  That's how real it tasted.  The dishes come with your choice of brown or steamed rice.  We shared both dishes and we were stuffed to our gills.    The service was great.  All the servers were attentive and made sure we were happy by filling up our drinks and asking if we needed anything.  We need to try their desserts next time.  We were so full, we couldn't eat another morsel.  Overall, this place is a real gem for vegetarians everywhere.  Located on the second floor of a complex with many Asian restaurants, this stands out as an awesome alternative for non meat eaters!",

We were then reminded every few minutes after that they were closing at 9:30. And I mean e v e r y few minutes! They tried clearing our plates while we were still eating...before 9:30. When it was all said and done they stacked all of our plates at the table and practically kicked us out. Not once did we complain about their behavior and we still left a decent tip. I mean, tbh, it was comical.   I have worked in restaurants my whole life and I have never had a more unwelcome experience. Needless to say, we won't be back. For everyone else, be sure to get there an hour before closing because they have zero respect for their patrons and give no leeway.  The food was just okay and the decor was dated and well used. They seem to have a lot of 5 star ratings for the food, but, personally, I have had veggie dishes that far exceed the fried, salty, overly sauced dishes prepared here. YMMV.",

    "text": "We love this place but the best indication I can give as to how good it is .. is that we have brought about 10 or more meat eaters here over the years & they've all left loving it ... one friend from Baltimore said \"Why do people even eat meat ??!!\"   But my favorite was my Father in Law who's an avid hunter & a cop who has for years made fun of us for being Vegetarian/Vegan. It took 10 years to get him to come with us anywhere as he suffered from the notion that being vegan means eating only bird seed & tofu & he even later admitted that he & my mother in law went to eat before they came to join us. So they only had small plates in front of them but they kept putting food on those plates !! He loved it !! Next time he came to town he asked \" Hey can we go to that vegan place again ??\" He's also since gone to LA Vegan with us (in LA where he lives) & loved it too !!  We like sitting on the round tables where they have the movable center piece so everyone can share each other's food. Get a taste of everything !!  We LOVE the Roti with Curry (Amazing !!) the General Tao (which they always anticipate me ordering - don't even have to ask) & the Happy Rolls sushi .. but everything is so good !! My wife always gets the spicy eggplant or Sesame Chicken.    And Chef Kenny is such a great guy .. so generous he'll walk around the dining room greeting guests & has even offered to help people shop at the Chinese market underneath Veggie House !!   Go today & take your favorite carnivore .. they'll be amazed !!",

If you're a starter and trying to go for an all vegan/vegetarian diet you should probably go here, their food isn't bland and tasteless like most vegetarian/vegan place. They make actual Chinese dishes but every single ingredient on the plate is all vegetarian ESP the meat. Their house crispy pan fried noodle is very delicious (maybe a little oily) but it tastes almost exact to the non veggies. The Tom yum soup is pretty good too, alongside with the Buddha delight yum! Oh and as appetizer I always order the turmeric salad. At first the taste was a little strange but now that I'm used to it, it's pretty addicting!! The food always makes me feel more energetic after I leave and the service is always so fast and the waiters/waitresses are very friendly. This place is totally worth the try! If you're a vegan or vegetarian and looking for a good place to eat (since there's like not that many good vegetarian places around) I would DEFINITELY recommend this veggie house go and try it if you haven't! Even if you're not vegetarian and you want to try some vegetarian food you can still go try it! It's pretty bomb. You won't regret it.",

They wouldn't do it again for me when I visited them a second time so, Veggie House, please put fried seaweed on your menu! It was so good! Highly recommend this place!",

The location is a little tough to find (2nd floor, corner, in a strip mall), but upon arriving your are greeted by an amusing sign forbidding you to bring any meat into the restaurant (no BYO meat!  lol).   The menu has a lot of options (which are played on 2 TV screens as you wait  *drool*).   Having read the Yelp reviews we decided to go with a bunch of items including some of the favorites:  Roti, Lettuce Wraps, and Crispy Spicy Eggplant.  The Eggplant dish was tasty but you definitely want a larger group to take down this platter.. nice and crispy, but obviously very fried.. good flavor.. and probably at least an entire eggplant.   The Roti and Lettuce Wraps were two of the favorite dishes.  The entrees came with tasty brown rice.  We opted to avoid the \"fake meat\" style dishes and went more with the vegetables/tofu/fried rice/noodles-type dishes.  Dessert was decent - vegan ice cream was tasty, but a tad icy and the fried root was only good as an ornament in my opinion.  vegan cheesecake was pretty yummy.    When we arrived there were ~5 other tables... not bad for Weds at 7:00, but not busy.  However once our food came out (remarkably quickly!) the business started to pick up!  When we left most of the restaurant was impressively filled.    Overall a good experience, quick service, tasty food.  The owner was very friendly and came by our table a couple times to chat.  We also saw him cleaning off tables and helping the staff (very respectable).  Would go again!",

During this time it is quite hard to find restaurants that a full vegetarian menu.  We tried the Veggie House and let me tell you it was amazing.  The food portions are big enough for two and three.  We had the house lomein, the eggplant with tofu, the spinach salad, and hot and sour soup.  The salad was very good. The lomein had the fake chicken, and fake shrimp with vegetables.   To be honest I couldn't tell very much that it was an imitation. My daughter loves Shrimp and she loved the \"fake\" shrimp. My  husband loved the eggplant.  The hot and sour soup was okay. We are very particular about our hot and sour soup.  But overall we love it.  We'll be going back again very soon.",

Prices are great for what you get! The portions are generous and the quality is unmatched. We have had just about everything on the menu, and have yet to find anything less than AMAZING. Chef Kenny is big on health, and will happily answer any inquiries about his cuisine. Try the Cilantro Salad and Cajun Shrimp if you like succulent spice. If not, give the Chow Fun or Lemon Chicken a try. EVERYTHING is vegan, so you honestly can't go wrong!",

    "text": "Food: It's hard to believe everything in this restaurant is vegan! I got the orange chicken and my boyfriend got the crispy beef. I found myself eating off both plates. Servings are large enough to share, so I could see myself bringing family and friends here. The only thing I wish was that more vegetables were on my plate. The orange chicken came with slices of mandarins which was complemented the faux meat but apart from chicken and rice, I didn't really have a balanced meal of proteins, carbs, and vegetables. (Some might not care, but when I go out to eat, I like to have as much of a balanced meal as possible.) I'm sure I could've ordered a vegetable dish, but that's just me being nit-picky. Anyway, the food was amazing. My boyfriend is a picky eater and even he scraped up the last of his dish. The orange chicken has a complexity that finishes delightfully and not like that vinegar-y overpowering stuff they have at other chain restaurants.  Atmosphere: Is kitschy charming. There's a faux gazebo and garden awnings on top of booths. There's also a bird's nest that chirps every once in a while. That was funny to try and figure out.   Service: Two women checked on us at the appropriate times. I asked for chili sauce to go with my meal and they obliged no problem.   Overall, I'm glad Las Vegas has a good vegetarian option that's meat-eater/picky-eater friendly. I'm excited to go back and try every single one of their dishes.",

Favorite part of the food is he makes food you won't find at any other vegan restaurant I've tried before! I got new ideas on how to prepare my veggie meals at home. I'm very picky when it comes to vegan food I'm used to the organic vegan restaurants in LA so I know my vegan food!! If your vegan this is a must try & if your not better reason to try out it will not disappoint you. The chef and  waitresses are super friendly & the service is pretty fast. I love how the chef comes around to the tables to make sure you like the food. I've tried everything he has recommended & it has been delicious! I've had almost everything on the menu  I liked it all.... some of my favorites are lotus root cake, crispy eggplant, Cajun fish, curry with rotti, walnut shrimp and the list goes on and on!! Happy to have a good vegan restaurant when I come to vegas. Tasty food plus great friendly service I will keep coming back ;)",

I prefer his veggie meat to the real thing! I really do! A few dishes we have tried that I was very impressed by were the Veggie Meatballs with Basil Sauce, the Lettuce Wrap is the bomb!! Crispy Spicy eggplant is a must, Sauteed Chinese Broccoli is delicious and light. Also, we loved the Spicy Veggie Orange Beef. The servers here are very friendly. They do not have alcohol, so I just get take out. I am going to ask if we can uncork a wine there though, it would be nice to eat in some time. Having just moved here from Austin Texas, it is wonderful to find a vegan restaurant that is serving up such delicious cuisine!! You can tell that the chef and the kitchen really cares and puts love into their dishes. My god, even their brown rice is amazing!!! Looking forward to leftovers tonight!! Thanks Veggie House!! :)",

    "text": "Holy holy holy sweet baby Jesus!!  My prayers have been answered. As a vegetarian, finding quality food that tastes bomb and still aligns with your moral compass can be challenging....which is odd to think, considering that Las Vegas is one of the culinary champions in the world.  Well, after reading many wonderful reviews from my fellow yelpers, I had to wing it.  Because I salivate on a daily basis for delicious Chinese cuisine. Low and flippin' behold VEGGIE HOUSE (angels just floated out of heaven and sang), I'm impressed, I'm happy and I'm in a food coma.  I literally had to ask two times, \"are you sure this isn't meat?\"  That shizznit is too legit!!  If it looks like meat, tastes like meat, then it MUST BE VEGGIE HOUSE!!! They should pay me to let them use this as a logo!  I'm going back for lunch tomorrow, and the next, and the next.  SO down to the facts,  China Town.  2nd floor above the market.   I kinda struggled a wee bit to find this gem, since I don't read Mandarin. Not a bad place to actually eat. Sometimes, when you find a diamond, it's in the ROUGH, realllll ROUGH.  They have a large selection to choose from...my personal fave so far General Tao - I salute thee.  And the Orange Beef is palette pleasing too!  I got a groupon and they had a yelp coupon, this girl bought them both!  Go, you definitely won't regret it.",

It's funny and incredibly ironic that you obviously know yelp but even better that you actually review the restaurant afterward complaining it's fake meat! Maybe you should use yelp to gain insight on the restaurant before you go rather than using yelp to complain about a place that only serves \"fake meat\". What is wrong with people?!?   Very cute restaurant is a strip mall in an Asian district (we saw thai, Japanese and Chinese places). We found this place on yelp and decided to try it out as me and the SO are vegetarians. The restaurant is hard to see up on the 2nd floor from the parking lot entrance...  We ordered pick up and it was already waiting for us when we got there. Price was great for the amount of food we got. Sweet and sour chicken had some odd chewy pieces (maybe trying to replicate real chicken dishes?) General tso's wad great as well as the spring rolls.   Food was hot and well packaged to go. Restaurant had super cute decor.  Lady who helped us was really nice.  Knocked that 1 star off because of the chewy pieces in the sweet and sour (about 10% of them) but we will be back.  I'd recommend...good vegetarian cuisine with cheap prices and good ambience.",

And the dish- I had oyster mushroom and lemongrass sauce- was tasty. My friend, a confirmed meat-man, liked the soup and the spring rolls very much. The fried oyster mushroom had that juicy interior that all fried foods should have, but don't. A big plus. My guess is that most people would find the Veggie House surprisingly good. However...the sodium and fat that is added in order to accomplish the transformation of vegey  into meat taste is, for me anyway, overpowering. Again, I think most will find the Veggie House surprisingly delicious for vegetarian cuisine.",

My vegan friend recommended that I try Veggie House since it was so close to Ronald's.  It was a plus that there was a Groupon available for this place.  We sat next to the the makeshift pond where they had water dripping off the roof of the gazebo with fake birds that would chirp every now and then.  I thought it was kinda cheesy but also kinda relaxing and nice.  We ordered the roti with curry, pan fried noodles and Cantonese pan-fried \"fish.\"  Our friendly waitress convinced us to try the Cantonese pan-fried \"fish\" after debating between that and a tofu dish.  She said we can order tofu at any Chinese restaurant but the \"fish\" we could only order there.  We were sold on the \"fish!\"  The roti was so delicious - it was like fluffy, heavenly crepes with delicious curry sauce for dipping, my BF still can't stop thinking about it to this day!  The pan fried noodles were crunchy with a delicious, savory sauce and the Cantonese pan fried \"fish\" really almost tasted like fish.  It was pretty creative how they wrapped the faux fish loaf with nori to give it a seaweed flavor.  We were happy we went with the waitress' suggestion!  The service was great and it seemed all the other customers were regulars.  I would also be a regular there if I lived in Vegas.  I will be coming back next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Since becoming a vegetarian I dream of this place. Veggie House is all about the vegan. The chef is also the creator of Veggeway. (Another awesome spot) Everything on the menu is vegan, but seriously you'd never know. Their menu features classic items like Orange \"Chicken\", Kung Po \"Shrimp\", Pan Fried Noodles and my favorite Spicy \"Beef\". Of course no animals are actually present in the food, but it's so delicious you meat lovers will never know it isn't the real thing.  Veggie House has a huge menu just like any Chinese Menu. As an appetizer I love the Spring Rolls. I really want to try the Happy Roll. It's their version of a \"sushi roll\". When you order your entree you get the option of brown or white rice which is awesome. To me it's all about the Spicy Beef. It's mouth watering and comes with broccoli. I have yet to try dessert because the portions of food are so large, but my friend had told me the cheesecake is bomb.  Besides the wonderful food I love that I leave feeling full, but not weighed down or tired like other Chinese places.  If you are in the mood for something new check out Veggie House! It rocks! Just remember SPICY \"BEEF\"!",

    "text": "Please note this review is not based on the food as we couldn't get a table.  The restaurant has large tables around the perimeter for 5-6 people with smaller tables in the center for 2-4 people. My husband and I went here for lunch and all the smaller tables were full so we were told to wait. I noticed all 5 large tables were empty, but I thought whatever. I know sometimes restaurants leave tables empty because theyre short staffed. So we sit and wait. And wait. And wait. Then a party of 5 walks in and theyre seated RIGHT AWAY at one of the larger tables. I ask her why we cant sit at a larger table and she says \"oh no, I cant put just 2 people at the big table.\"  Thats ridiculous! There were 4 more large tables empty. You really think 4 large parties are going to walk in?? You think a party of 5 will be quicker than a party of 2??? She told us we have to continue to wait til a smaller party left - so we just left instead. I wont even bother coming in next time... Bye.",

    "text": "Service is fast, friendly, and best of all, the waitresses speak english! Everything is vegetarian, so when you see orange chicken on the menu, it's not actually orange chicken, it's vegetarian soy product that looks like chicken with orange sauce which is really tasty!  Their dishes can be really creative like the fish dishes where it really looks like fish, and the fish skin is dried seaweed to add texture. Very well done.  update 2/9/13: Lunch specials from 11am-3pm everyday!!! Came here twice for lunch and the lunch specials are pretty good as it includes soup, white or brown rice (no extra charge) or a steamed bun, and the main entree. The portions for lunch specials are large enough to do family style with a couple people. The other day we also tried some dinner items and were equally impressed such as the japanese pumpkin with silky tofu and vegetables. YUM!  The spicy eggplant is not really spicy as it is sweet, but they are perfectly fried and I would be happy to eat those instead of french fries.   Just a reminder that the entire place has no meat. So if they menu says beef, chicken, fish, it's not actually meat it is a soy product that looks like meat, but it tastes pretty authentic.   Service is very quick too so if you need a fast place for lunch, this is a great healthy spot.",

They have an area underneath a lighted gazebo for 9-12 people. Water feature which I thought sounded like a waterfall to a pond but I was wrong, it actually came off a makeshift corrugated tin hut roof.  The service here was excellent. Actually had servers who speak clear English, which is a plus! Even the Chef came out and walked around the restaurant to greet customers.   As for the food. Our first visit we ordered:  WONTON SOUP is great for cold days or if you're sick. Great comfort soup!  GENERAL TSO CHICKEN it was slightly spicy but not too overwhelming. My honey enjoyed this dish!  PAN FRIED NOODLES was the bomb! A MUST ORDER!! If you get this To-Go. Ask for the sauce on the side otherwise you'll come home to soggy noodles and the crunchy noodle helps make this dish what it is.   FRIED BANANA with Vanilla Ice \"cream\". Typical fried banana dessert. Not too sweet. Good flavor.   On our 2nd trip we ordered...  CURRY & ROTI (appetizer) ORDER THIS!! You will not regret it. I think it's one of the best curry dish I've ever had. I would order this as an entree if they offer it!!  ORANGE CHICKEN...lightly deep fried but was surprise with the spiciness of the dish. Not my favorite but still a contender for those who like sweet, spicy and crunchy.   CHOW MEIN was excellent. I had it the next day for leftovers and still tasted awesome. A little oily but very flavorful.   I recommend getting the noodle dishes here. You won't regret it. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but I was this week!!   Thanks Veggie House for offering so many vegan options!",

    "text": "Back in Rowland Heights, California, I'd hit up a vegetarian Chinese restaurant called Happy Family, and I always found myself eating more than usual there because there's nothing like it in Vegas. But I'm thankful and happy to had found Veggie House on Yelp, which I'd like to think of as Vegas' own Happy Family.   FOOD +Vegetable Soup: This is a complimentary bowl of soup that comes with your order(s). Swimming in a light broth are chopped carrots, celery, onions, and cabbage. The soup is on the bland side and is in need of salt or other seasonings to give it some life.   +Walnut Shrimp:  Lightly battered and fried \"shrimp\" in mayonnaise sauce that's topped with toasted walnuts. Sure enough, it tasted like walnut shrimp. Could've fooled me into thinking it was real shrimp I was biting into. Mayonnaise sauce is a bit much, and I had to wipe the excess off onto my plate.    +Yee Shang: Soft pieces of eggplant wading in a sweet and spicy sauce. I asked our waitress how spicy is the dish, and she said the chef could prepare it \"very spicy\", which was what I ordered. When I took a bite out of my eggplant, I tasted no spiciness whatsoever. I took another bite thinking that if the first one didn't hit me then the second one will. Nope. Mouth wasn't on fire. Our waitress returned and asked if the eggplant was spicy enough. I said it wasn't spicy at all. Even my friend who has a lower tolerance to spice agreed. So the waitress gave me a small saucer of hot chili sauce that helped resolved the minor issue (nice!). Spicy or not the eggplant is just as delicious without the extra heat.  +Crispy Oyster Mushroom: This was my friend's order. Deep fried oyster mushrooms and a side of white rice. Of course this was good, because it was deep fried!   +Orders come with your choice of white or brown rice. If you order a lunch special ($6.50!), you can choose to order a bun instead.  SERVICE Fantastic. The two waitresses were so kind and helpful. Even the chef came out from the kitchen to ask about our meal. The service made me feel welcome.  RESTAURANT Aside from being clean and bright, this restaurant has a soothing quality to it, thanks to the fountain located on one end of the restaurant. Also, if someone claps or maybe drops a pot or pan in the back, a pair of fake birds start to chirp once their sensors go off. Definitely cute and unexpected.   OVERALL I'm rating Veggie House 4.50 Stars because of how both my orders had too much sauce, and also for the bland soup that was served prior to the main courses. Other than those criticisms, Veggie House has saved me a long trip to SoCal for vegetarian Chinese food. This is a return spot for me.",

Fast forward to a couple years, and this time I was able to sit down and try a bunch of different items. I'm glad to say that the quality has been maintained, and I had a real solid meal.  You know the deal with vegetarian restaurants.. They are normally pretty awful. That is because top chefs do not like to be limited on what they can or cannot cook. (they also love meat!) Fortunately, in the hands of the talented Chef Kenny, the dishes here are executed to a high degree, and one can be forgiven for confusing a faux meat dish with the real deal.  Follow the Yelpers advice for ordering at this place. I rarely say this because people have slightly different palettes. But, I believe due to Chef Kenny's consistency, anyone can have a good meal. The spicy crispy eggplant is really good. They reminded me of portobello fries. The crispy beef was another winner. Even though I love the taste of beef, and that was obviously missing, the texture was really good. But, I wasn't a big fan of the faux chicken dishes, but they were good for what they were. I also didn't get the ice cream over sticky rice, I'll be scratching my head over that one for a while.  I'm a pure carnivore. That is how I will be for the rest of my days. I do believe that we need to eat more vegetables for environmental issues. I find this restaurant interesting. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to vegetarians looking for a good meal, and I will take vegetarians to this place.",

It's off the strip in Chinatown but is so worth the ride. The chef came out and talked with us about different options and how they made things seem so similar to the traditional versions of the menu offerings. Don't be fooled. Even though the menu says duck, chicken, beef or shrimp, everything there is completely meat free! it's delicious and the prices were excellent. Do yourself a favor and stop in.",

I brought a friend (meat lover) and she said that if she could eat this everyday, then she could easily become a vegetarian. A lot of the food is nothing like you would ever experience before and you won't find it at any local grocery store. A lot of the food inspirations were better than the food that inspired them.  I have tried everything from the mixture seafood to their stir fried beef. It is hard to pick one that a loved more, but the most recent one I loved was their pineapple duck. The texture of the food is amazingly close to the real thing, or so my meat eater friends have told me, and the sauce was perfect. It came with it covered in sauce and surrounded with pineapples. The look of it would remind you the look of real duck at the regular restaurant. All this and no cruelty for a low price!  Their fish to me is better than the animal version. Texture is amazingly close, but better in its own way. The taste is dead on, but no nasty mercury after taste. My uncle told me it does not taste like any specific fish, but it does taste like fish. My uncle, by the way, loves fish to death and he enjoyed the fish there too. Their sushi as an appetizer is really good also, or it could be a meal.  Their desserts are very interesting and they even have vegan options. I have had the bean cake topped with green tea ice cream. Presentation is as cool as the ice cream and the taste was top notch. Definitely try that if you ever go.  Overall, I love the place, its easily one of my favorite vegetarian/vegan spots. The service is incredible and everyone is super nice. The decor is really cool and they have done a lot with the place. It is really relaxing and the next time your there, look for the animatronic birds in the corner over the pond, they chirp.",

We both agreed that the food was delicious and we're really impressed by how much the presentation and texture of the vegetarian meat resembled the real thing.  We ordered the beef roll as an appetizer.  It was really really good.  The texture, presentation, and taste were all there.  Other dishes that we ordered were orange chicken, spicy eggplant fries, and pineapple duck.  The orange chicken was delicious.  Just looking at the dish, it looks just like the orange chicken that you'll find at a Chinese fast food.   Took a bite and said to me hubby, \"wow, this is chewy, just like chicken.\"  I recommend the spicy eggplant fries.  Just the right amount of spiciness and very crispy.  The pineapple duck was okay.  The presentation was good, but the flavoring was a bit bland.  This is our least favorite dish of the ones we ordered, but still impressed by how closely the presentation and texture resembled the real thing.  Next time we're in Vegas and wants vegetarian food, we'll come here again to try other dishes.",

    "text": "Found this place on yelp while we were running errands in their area. Previous reviews mention that it is a 'vegan' restaurant and I want to clarify that since they use eggs, including some of the noodles, it is a vegetarian restaurant, but there is no shortage of options to choose if you so desire a vegan meal.   We ordered the crispy wanton appetizer, veggie house soup, crispy beef, crispy scallop, and the fried rice with egg.   The filling in the wonton was sort of a veggie mash that was bland and the wonton wrapper was thick and rather starchy. You definitely needed to dip it in the sweet sauce that accompanied the dish.   The soup was a mild cabbage broth with celery, bits of carrot, fennel, and tofu cubes. I found myself adding more and more white pepper to season it. I appreciate low sodium in dishes, but it still should be seasoned well to avoid a blah blandness.   The crispy beef was pretty tasty. You have to eat it right away or the sauce gooeys the crispyness into mush. The crushed peanuts on top added a nice texture. The broccoli that was served along side the dish was just steamed and a bit on the cool side when it reached our table.   The crispy spicy scallops had a sweet in spicy sauce that had red bell peppers and thinly sliced Persian cucumbers. The scallops were good for me but my partner couldn't get over the chewy texture. They use giant oyster mushroom stems to make the scallops. There was definitely a taste of mushroom. Not the dish for you if you don't like mushrooms.   The fried rice had raisins, pineapple, peas, egg, veggie ham, and veggie crab. The rice was typical fried rice in flavor with a small note of sweetness from the raisins and pineapple. The veggie ham pieces were so small, you didn't even notice them. The veggie crab had the consistency of little gelatinous snot balls and did nothing for the dish. I picked them out.   The service was great. Our server was overly happy and constantly smiling and even brought our toddler a free bowl of steamed rice.  The ice tea is worth noting. They brew it there using red tea leaves. It was crisp and refreshing and we prob had 5 refills. The green tea is not loose leaves but is in a tea bag added to your tea pot.   I would not go out of my way to come back, but if I was in close proximity, and hungry, and it was lunch time so I could get the $6.50 lunch special, then I'd prob pop in for more of that crispy beef.  So 2 stars for the food and an extra for our friendly server.",

    "text": "I read an article about Veggie House in the August 1st edition of the RJ.  I needed an excuse to check out this newly-opened all vegetarian/vegan restaurant so when I was hungry the following Saturday night, we made the drive down there.    We were greeted with a sample of the crispy beef from the chef.  It was great, lighty crisp, tossed in a sweet & savory sauce, sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  I ordered the 2 item cold dish combo for an appetizer and selected the BBQ Meat and the Bitter Melon Salad.  I asked what the bitter melon was before ordering and was told that it was a squash that was mildly bitter.  The BBQ Meat can be passed off as the BBQ Pork I remember eating as a little kid, red on the outside and grey on the inside.  The Bitter Melon was terrible.  Not that it was prepared yucky, it is just not a vegetable we could eat.  Entrees were General Tzo Chicken, Szechuan Shrimp and House Chow Fun.  The General Tzo Chicken is 5 stars!  Fried crispy on the outside but chewy in texture on the inside.  Tossed in a sweet and spicy sticky sauce, perfect for clinging to the rice.  The Szechuan Shrimp sauce had a good flavor and it really did look like shrimp, the taste and \"shrimpy flavor\" was a little too much for me.  I'm glad I tried it, and I'm sure that it is a favorite of shrimp lovers but I can't say that I will order it again.  The Chow Fun was great too.  The vegetables were stir fried in a super hot wok that gave them that smokey burnt flavor on the edges and perfectly cooks them to a crisp tender.    The service was fast, friendly and attentive.  When we got the check, the order was taken in Chinese so I had to stare at the symbols for 10 minutes.",

I have taken numerous non-vegan friends to Veggie House and they just can't get over the food.They swear over and over it is not Vegan. My favorites are the cilantro salad, the crispy beef (not really beef), the Buddha Delight and the (absolutely wonderful) cherry chocolate ice cream. We have eaten here at least 25 times since we arrived (6 months ago) and is the restaurant we measure every other restaurant by.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I kind of stumbled upon this restaurant through groupon and decided to come here. Our good friend is vegetarian, so we all decided to pick out a dish. We ordered the crispy eggplant that was recommended by many yelpers, the crispy veggie scallops, and the steamed ginger chicken with brown rice.  The crispy eggplant was really delicious. As stated by some yelpers, they are like french fries, but with a twist!! It was topped off with garlic, which I love!!! The steamed ginger chicken was to die for!!! It amazes me that its not chicken, but it tastes like chicken!!! It was mind boggling. hahaha. As for the crispy veggie scallops, it was good, but not great. I think it is because I am a huge scallop lover and I love the real thing. As for the price, they give you A LOT of food for what you pay for. =) Since I am a piggy, more the food... the more the merrier!! ::CHOMP CHOMP::  The staff was incredibly nice. At one point, the waitress introduced us to Chef Kenny. He was so nice and humble. Although we aren't vegetarian (except for my friend) we loved the food and definitely will be back.  I can't wait to try more things and maybe one day I will convert into becoming vegetarian!!",

After recently going vegetarian (and mostly vegan! :D ) we heard about Veggie House from SEVERAL people.. through social media, friends, and even servers at other restaurants. We knew we had to check it out!  We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer - AMAZING! Kung Pao chicken w/ brown rice + Orange chicken w/ brown rice -YUP. BOTH GREAT!!  We received the Kung Pao chicken first .. got a picture of it &destroyed it. We then got the orange chicken and didn't even give ourselves a second to capture a photo of it .. oops!!  We didn't get our daily soup w/ our lunch specials but it was fine because we were so stuffed anyways!! Better off not wasting it but I'm sure it was delicious as well.  I will 100% recommend this restaurant not only to Vegans but anyone loving some good Chinese food!!   Place was very clean! A little hard to find if you've never been before - it's on the 2nd level tucked away so look carefully!!   ALSO - When can we expect another location!??!",

This is a \"super delicious\" vegan restaurant.   Parking here is always simple. There are stairs, but if you can not walk up stairs I believe that they have parking in the back which leads into the restaurant on level ground. The seating is great. Lots of space and a beautiful environment. The staff is quick and friendly. And service as a whole is great.   Thai Tea and Orange Chicken are definitely my recommendation for first timers, I can almost guarantee you'll be hooked. Also check out that dessert menu ;)",

The ingredients of what is actually inside is probably not that healthy for you, but I am definitely not an expert. The downside was the sauce, which I figured would be much easier than making a synthetic shrimp...the sauce was 3/10 and did not taste like a typical really good walnut shrimp sauce. The mustard flavor was way too strong.",

She's on a more restrictive diet that calls for more vegetables and avoiding meat so a quick search on Yelp for vegetarian fare brought us to Veggie House.  We ordered the crispy orange \"chicken\" and vegetable \"seafood\" lo mein. I think the orange \"chicken\" was made with gardein. The flavor of the dish was delicious and the texture of the \"chicken\" reminded me of the gardein boneless wings from Yardhouse. The vegetable seafood lo mein was a mixed bag. I was really expecting thicker noodles but the restaurant used something akin to instant ramen noodles and the dish had to be sent back to get heated up because it was tepid. Bleh! Once it was heated up it was good. One thing though, my wife and I were fascinated by the \"shrimp\" in the seafood mix. Even though the flavor wasn't like real shrimp, it just kind of blew our minds that the texture would be so similar to actual shrimp cooked rare. Bravo! Too bad there were only a few pieces of \"shrimp\" in the entire dish.  The two dishes we got was plenty of food. The both of us were so full after finishing dinner and are curious about the variety of other dishes offered and will definitely come back there the next time we pass by Las Vegas.",

I am not vegan or vegetarian but the food lived up to the hype and expectation.  I ordered the Orange Chicken, and Kung Pow 3 and they were great! I preferred the Orange Chicken. They were full of flavor, great texture and had a nice presentation. I was most impressed with the beef in the King Pow. It looked and tasted exactly like beef. Because I was being greedy, I ordered the Cheesecake with chocolate raspberry ice cream, delicious. I am not a fan of sweets or cheese cake but this one I would definitely recommend for cheese cake lovers. The cheese cake filling texture was pot on the and ice cream flavor was very rich. Lastly, Peggy topped it off with vegan candy. Amaz-balls. I wish I knew where they purchased them because I world fed buy a bag to snack on and keep on display for house guests! Try them!

    "text": "Delicious vegetarian restaurant located in Chinatown, in the same plaza as some other eateries (including Swish Shabu Shabu and Island Malaysian Cuisine) and a supermarket. Located on the 2nd floor, close by the stairs.  Anyways, when we entered, on Christmas Eve a little before 6:30 pm, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a table for 2. After we were finally seated and looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:  Turmeric Salad, $5.95 prior to tax- This salad automatically comes with the dressing on the side. I really liked this salad. It is made with a mix of the healthy dark green leafs, Romaine lettuce and spinach. The flavors were good, especially the dressing. And this is a great starter to share with another person.   Curry Duck, $12.95 prior to tax- I thought this curry duck was good, but my husband really liked this more. I thought the \"duck\" itself was average, and wished the texture was better. I liked the sauce of this dish. I liked that there were braised green beans in this entree. This dish is good, but not as good as I was hoping it would be. I probably wouldn't order this again.  Spicy Veggie Crispy Beef, $13.50 prior to tax- The texture of this entree is very similar to beef. I really liked the flavors of this dish as well. I thought the sauce was good. I liked the chopped nuts (well I think they are nuts, but they may have been something else) on top of the beef and I also liked that there were a few broccoli florets on this plate, but would have been nice to have a little bit more.   Both the curry duck and crispy beef entree came with your choice of brown or white rice. My husband and I opted for the brown rice (which was made perfectly)..  --------------------- (Total= $35.02 after tax, prior to tip)  Service was good for the most part. Our server was nice and gave good recommendations. I appreciated his input when I asked him what his opinion was for some of the menu items. But we did wait quite a while to get our check and to get our boxes to take home some of our leftovers.   By the way, there is a $6 credit card minimum and there is also free WiFi here (chefkenny, one word).   There is also one single men's restroom and one single women's restroom. The women's restroom was clean upon this visit and stocked with the essentials.   The 4 employees working here all speak English and are nice. They are more than happy to explain any of the menu items.   Will definitely come back here again. Would like to try their veggie happy roll and some of their lunch specials.",

    "text": "I WISH THEY HAD ONE HERE!!  If you're in Vegas - while I know it's such a FOOD MECCA.. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND going out of the beaten path and trying Veggie House!    This is specifically Vegetarian Chinese Food! It's about eating chinese food made out of pressed tofu - you get all the flavors and textures of the dish but there's NO MEAT!  It's not about just eating veggies made different ways - it's really about enjoying chinese classics without the meat!!  We had the Kung Pao Chicken and I tell you - it was flavorful - tasted JUST like Kung Pao Chicken I grew up eating in SF Chinatown! It looked and tasted like chicken but after careful dissection - it was pressed tofu! It was SO GOOD!!!  The table next to us had the Orange Chicken - it looked JUST like orange chicken and they way they gobbled it up - I believe they were happy with it....  Our second dish was the crispy spicy eggplant - where they slice up the eggplant like french fries - fry it up with a mild spicy sauce - so it's crispy, light and SO GOOD!  I honestly will make this place our MUST GO TO place everything we come to Vegas!!! it's a local hangout and it's AWESOME. I wish we could've tried more dishes - will just have to invite more people so we can try more dishes!!  I haven't had great vegetarian chinese food since I went to Hong Kong 30 years ago! It brought back those fond memories!  But at least this place is in the same continent for me!! :)",

There were cheat days, there were weak days, there were days I needed the 100% replica but in soy or tofu of that chinese flavor I miss so much.   Veggie house is a great substitute and I would come back with more people so we can try more things!",

For the decor they tried to bring the outdoors inside with a small waterfall and two tables placed under big canopy umbrellas.  Wooden chairs are comfortable.  There are also booths available.  There is one small table outside too. The entire menu is free of animal protein so while the menu may read \"chicken\" or \"shrimp\" it is the vegan version that is being offered.  We had spring rolls and house soup as appetizers.  Food came out of the kitchen quickly and tasted fresh and light.  We had the delicious Thai iced tea which was not over-sweet like in other restaurants.  We did not follow other reviewers' advice to leave room for dessert so we cannot comment.

Flavor was solid and I might try this dish again for that reason alone.  Buddha delight is probably my favorite item here now after sampling a range of the menu.

Veggie House has seriously become a staple to our rotation of restaurants to dine at and the consistency is always on point. We absolutely LOVEEE the Crispy Spicy Eggplant with their special blend of Brown rice. There are soooo many choices for your stomach to try and I have to keep coming back. They have recently added the Walnut Shrimp to their menu and it is WAYYY BETTER than the one you get from Panda Express. The vegan meat they cook with tastes almost identical to the real thing, it's INCREDIBLE.  Peggie is usually our server and she is just the Sweetest lady that wants you to have a great time eating here. She always comes around and checks on us. In addition, Peggie knows that my Fiancee and I CRAVE their FRESH chili sauce. The owners of the restaurant do a fantastic job of running this restaurant and we will continue coming back for more Vegan Chinese food! :D",

No, you can't tell the difference. I got he General Tzo's chicken. I legitimately could not tell the difference from real chicken. I will definitely be back here many many more times.   I ordered through Grubhub for a pickup so I cannot speak to the actual dining in experience, but the member of the staff who assisted me was very nice and made me laugh.   Tip: it may be a little overwhelming when you navigate to the address because it is a strip mall location. When you pull into the mall, they are located upstairs to the left.",

    "text": "Let me start with an absolute & full disclosure: Veggie House uses absolutely no animal products. The restaurant is completely vegan & free of GMOs and dairy.  As someone who considers themselves a carnivore, I can honestly tell you that the chef does an incredible job at Veggie House. The flavors he puts on your table are absolutely delicious.  Can you tell the difference? In a short answer - yes. The texture of the food is different than those of their animal counterparts. However, the flavors are so great - if you're a \"carnivore\" like me, it doesn't matter. You will enjoy every bite. Maybe even more than the counterparts.  I am not sure how they put together walnut shrimp without even using the slightest amount of dairy products but it was delectable. One of the best I've ever had. The orange chicken was great too - the breading was crisp & the orange sauce outshines most. The house noodles were delicious as well. Although, I do wish the vegetables on this dish were cooked longer. The broccoli was just shy of being raw.  Now, will I be back? Without hesitation.",

I had did some research but everything on the strip did look too good or we just didn't feel like eating. Someone earlier in the day at the car rental both told us to go to Chinatown so we googled restaurants in Chinatown and we found this hidden gem. Everything was freaking amazing! We had the veggie potstickers and it was really good 5/5. It tasted as if it was homemade and not store-bought (not pictured because we ate it too quickly). Because I am lactose intolerant I'm usually never able to have Thai tea because they always make it with cows milk but they're Thai tea with soy was awesome (there's also an option to have it with almond milk). We had the crispy Cajun fried fish 5/5, the spicy fried beef 5/5, and for dessert we have the Matcha tea ice cream with warm sticky rice 5/5. This was absolutely the best vegan food that we have had ever. My wife and I are foodies and we are from New York and this was absolutely the best vegetarian/vegan food and we have eaten at many vegetarian restaurants and this is hands-down the best vegan food, not just in Las Vegas but that I have ever eaten. I grew up around vegetarians and vegans and even though I eat meat this was an over-the-top experience that we can eat vegan every day. We kept bragging about how good the food was and Chef Lee came out and spoke to us and we had an awesome conversation. Very humble guy very personable and makes amazing food. You need to go to this place!",

The sign on the door actually says to not bring any meat into the restaurant. This is by far the best \"shrimp\" I've had at any vegan place! The house noodles were flavorful and had plenty of \"beef\" and \"chicken\". The honey walnut shrimp was sweet and sticky and yummy. When in Vegas, I promise to visit you Veggie House!",

Guys this food is so freaking worth it. Nothing on the menu has yet to disappoint the tastebuds. My favorites have to be their Thai ice tea, the happy rolls when they're fresh, and their chicken potato curry dish. I could go without the imitation meat in that one, but the sauce is to die for. Unless you up for it, I wouldn't bother with the desserts, they're really small and not really worth their prices.",

I may still be traumatized from some vegetarian potluck gone-bad in my childhood.  This place is different. It's amazing. Come here.  Everything I have tried here has been excellent. Here are my favorites:  Crispy Eggplant 5/5 I checked in with yelp and decided we needed to try this even though we were here for dessert. Very happy I did. Crispy fried goodness with a delicious sauce, this dish highly recommended for good reason. Get it.  Crispy Oyster Mushrooms 5/5 It's hard to describe how good this dish is, it's just ridiculous. Deep fried crispy mushrooms drenched in a thick, rich lemongrass sauce and tossed with sauteed veggies. Be warned, this is a dish you will remember for a long time and probably have serious cravings for. If you try this while visiting Vegas, you may find yourself needing to come back here just to get more.  Vanilla vegan Ice Cream 5/5 Creamy. Vanilla. Perfect level of sweetness. Yummy.  Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream  & Sticky Rice 5/5 WOW. One of the best desserts I have had in a long time, vegan or otherwise. They make this with real black cherries and chunks of dark chocolate. The sticky rice is a must, it's served hot and the ice cream starts melting over it. This one was so good we had to order a second round before we left.  Service here was super friendly and the decor is nice, everything looks very clean.  They currently have a yelp special for 10% off dinner items, check in here and use it.  Easy 5 stars.",

    "text": "I am not vegetarian or vegan, but the majority of my boyfriend's family is. The vegans and vegetarians of the family loved it. One said that, \"This is a great way for vegetarians to curb their cravings for meat, without actually having it.\"  I personally loved the Orange Chicken - it was AMAZING. I couldn't even tell it wasn't real chicken. I would eat that every week if I lived close enough to this restaurant. The Spicy Eggplant was also a real treat. Perfectly cooked.  We got the Hot and Sour soup which was great. It was a little spicier than I expected, but still very rich in flavor. I normally don't like soups at Asian cuisine restaurants, so this was a nice surprise.  We got the BBQ Beef appetizer, but almost our entire table - vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike - did not like it. It was \"okay\" as long as it was hot, but once it cooled down at all it just wasn't delicious at all.  I will say the veggie shrimp was really not my cup of tea, but the rest of the table seemed to like it. It tasted like plain (but perfectly cooked) tofu.  Even for the veggie meats that we all didn't like - the presentation was so, so amazing. It all looked exactly like the \"real\" meat it was mimicing.  The service was beyond excellent. Attentive and chipper even when we had a big party and the rest of the restaurant was packed.  Even though I personally (a carnivore) did not like how certain things tasted, I have to admit I would definitely come back here anytime and explore more items on the menu. Probably leaning towards the veggie chicken items.",

I was a little hesitant at first -- vegan \"meat\" tends to be very hit-or-miss, in my (omnivorous) opinion... -- but once our food arrived, it was official: Veggie House has won me over! I'm glad I ventured outta my comfort zone & tried something new.  Naturally, our group of 4 decided to try a little bit of everything: fried eggplant & a Happy roll as appetizers, followed by 2 types of \"shrimp,\" \"scallops,\" and a \"beef\" dish as our main course(s). All of which were superb! My personal favorite was the spicy hon hon \"shrimp!\" ...and honestly, I could say I like this version of \"shrimp\" way better than the original.  We were seated & served right away, and the food came out fairly quick --- no complaints here! I'll definitely be dining here again soon.",

Apparently, they accidentally wandered in on another occasion and the food was so amazing, they wanted to come back.    We ordered a few entrees to share to get a good sample of the different items.  Everything I tried was delicious.  There were even some dishes that if I didn't know better I would swear were not vegan.   The staff was very friendly and Chef Kenny himself was running around making sure everything was perfect.    Vegans and Meat eaters alike will love this place.  I will definitely be going back.

One of my fellow vegan coworkers recommends this place avidly to everyone who expresses interest in vegan cuisine and let me just say, it does not disappoint! I went with my boyfriend and his family. We had a huge selection of items from their very expansive menu. My favorite was definitely the walnut shrimp. It really is hard to believe some of the items aren't animal products but it makes me so in revolt happy that they are all 100% vegan. Our server did inform us that they use eggs upon request only, which was comforting further. I love this place because you can't deny that they thoroughly believe in being vegan and embrace it in their dishes better than any place I've been to yet.",

The duck had a pineapple glaze that was surprisingly not overwhelmingly sweet, the house noodles came with shrimp that could have fooled me for real shrimp, and the cilantro salad is tossed with a vinegary dressing, that some might consider a bit pungent, but overall was delicious.. especially if you love cilantro as much as I do. The only negative thing I have to say is that we waited awhile to be seated when there were plenty of vacant tables.. once we were seated and placed our orders, however, the food came in a timely manner and the customer service was terrific.

    "text": "I've been to Veggie House Vegetarian Restaurant on multiple occasions, and it is one of the few places I consistently recommend to others, regardless if they're vegan/vegetarians/omnivores/carnivores/t-rexes.   Here's why: *The decor is lovely. *The service is wonderful. *The prices are reasonable (ESPECIALLY the lunch special). *Nearly everything is delicious. *The menu is massive. *They have a charming sign on the door that basically says \"NO MEAT ALLOWED!\" :D  I've had a chance to try multiple dishes and thought I'd provide my thoughts on a few: -Curry Chicken with Potato: Possibly my favorite dish. The curry sauce creates the perfect gravy for the chicken and potatoes. An ideal comfort food!  -Geese: Amazing layers of veggies with a crispy outer crust. I don't know how the Chef makes this one, but it's divine. Pair your leftovers with a salad and you'll have a great lunch the next day.  -General Tzo Chicken: This is my non-vegetarian boyfriend's most favorite dish. He says it reminds him of Orange Chicken and he literally orders it every single time. -Crispy Spicy Eggplant: A lot of reviewers hailed this as the most delicious dish on the menu, but this is where I'm going to have to disagree. I found it to be too sweet and the sauce to be too thick to properly enjoy. -Crab Meat Shark Fin Soup: We decided to try something different when we ordered this one with egg drops. It was interesting, but not a hit. I think it would have been better without the egg, so consider that before ordering.  -Walnut Shrimp: I found the faux-seafood to be too convincing. Ordinarily, that's a compliment to the chef. However, when things taste a little too much like the \"real deal,\" I start to freak out and panic and can't enjoy the meal because I worry I accidentally ate meat. I'm a crazy vegetarian, what can I say. -Drinks: No fountain drinks, but a decent selection of canned or bottled sodas and juices.   Worth noting, I have taken both my younger brother (who would live off Carl's Jr. if he could) and boyfriend (who usually threatens to break up with me any time I recommend a vegetarian restaurant for dinner) here and they both loved it just as much as I did. So, rest-assured vegetarians and meat-eaters alike will enjoy this place! You can even bring your pet T-Rex!",

My wife and I shared it cuz it was lunchtime.  That and an appetizer was enough.   Servers were very friendly.  Cool atmosphere including water fall.  Used groupon 10$ for $20.  Server took it ahead if time which was convenient.  Cant wait to go back and try the Chef's, who was present in dining room, other items.",

The food and Chef Kenny are awesome as he is always dropping off samples of his other dishes while stopping by the tables to say hi and chat for a minute. You really can't go wrong but we always order the crispy beef, orange chicken, green beans and the chow fun noodles. We have tried a lot of other dishes and mostly all have been outstanding. Can't wait until they open a location closer to Summerlin so we can go more often.",

A meal without meat can hardly be called a meal. On top of that the word is vegetable, not veggie, there are few things I hate more than the term veggie. That all being said, this place is great. I went in with much trepidation (I was having lunch with a friend and this was his pick). I figured I would order vegetable fried rice or something inoffensive like that, you see I also don't like substitutes, I don't like fake sugar, I don't like carib, I don't like soy for meat. My friend talked me into the crispy \"beef\". I reluctantly agreed. I was pleasantly surprised, it was so good I forgot I was eating tofu. So here I stand (or sit at my computer) having to admit I was wrong and in fact sometimes a meal without meat is still indeed a meal. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",

The chef came to our table and answered all of the questions we had about his cuisine. The food was amazing!! Delectible and creative, we enjoyed the idea that everything we ate were vegetables, even if it looked or tasted like meat. Plenty of texture and chew. The memorables were the Eggplant and a Seafood dish with \"fish\" and \"shrimp.\" The sauces were amazing, particularly considering that they did not cook with garlic or onion, as they practice a form of Buddhism that does not integrate these into food. This experience is recommended for anyone who wants to see and taste the possibilities of a delicious meatless cuisine!",

The popularity of this local cuisine was so intense they've now expanded to double the size of their seating availability. If there's a meat eater in your crowd, they will be amazed with what the partner chefs can do with tofu!  There is NO MEAT on the menu but if you order any of the \"meat or foul or seafood-named\" dishes, you'd swear you can't tell the difference. The green beans are to die for, the sushi is delish!  The wait staff's service is attentive and friendly and helpfully answer your questions.  There is a secret dish the chefs choose each month and if you happen to order it, you receive a dollar token that you place in a charity jar of your choosing.  In the very near future we were told by one of the chefs that he will be recording Vegan cooking shows; I believe it will on UTube. Please try Veggie House for an amazing, healthy, fresh, tasty, Asian fare.  I'm sure you'll return again and again.",

Don really took care of us and went out of his way to ensure our orders kept coming out.  The Spicy Crispy Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken were my favorite dishes.   Even though I knew they were vegetarian dishes, it was easy to identify them with the meat, poultry and fish dishes I'd have in a non-vegetarian restaurant.  The transition to tasty vegetarian dishes is a testament to the fresh ingredients and the skill set of the chef.  Highly recommended and I will definitely be back.",

I got the spicey veggie pad Thai, and holy crap, it was amazing! It had vegan shrimp in it, and I don't know how they did it, but they nailed it completely. The taste and texture was just like shrimp. I only come to Vegas once a year, but I'll definitely be back the next time I come here.",

I was very intrigued by how a vegan restaurant can use tofu based ingredients that would end up tasting like meat.   We ordered the spicy crispy eggplant, kung pao \"chicken\", house pan fried noodle, vegan roasted \"pork\" and the curry \"chicken\" and DAYUMMMMNNN everything tasted pretty good!   The dishes we ordered that had \"chicken\" in it seriously tasted like real chicken!! As a meat eater, I had to remind myself that I was at a Chinese vegan restaurant!   The house pan fried noodle had \"shrimp\" in and it looked and tasted almost like shrimp!   I was disappointed at the roasted \"pork\" dish. The coloring was a little off from the real roast pork that I've had my entire life. It also didn't taste like pork. It tasted more like cooked dried bean curd. When I added the plum sauce to it, it tasted a little more like \"pork\" but it wasn't the same.  This restaurant is definitely an awesome hidden gem in Las Vegas! I highly recommend coming here when you are in the area!  Free parking in their lot and free wifi is a plus!",

    "text": "So let's start this by saying that I am NOT a vegetarian let alone a vegan.  I have much respect for people that can live that lifestyle. . .but I love me some BEEF!  =)  Now that being said. . .when I first went to Veggie House. . .I was wondering how I was going to like the fake meat.  Trust me. . .I had serious doubts. . .but my friends wanted to go and try it, so I went along with them. . .  Maybe it was because my expectations were so low. . .that first time. . .but everything that we had was DELICIOUS and so on point.  I think I asked the wait staff about 5 times in that meal. . .you sure this is not real meat???  =)  The textures of the differnet meats that we had were really to close to what you would think the real stuff would be like.  We had crispy beef, crispy eggplant, General Tzo's chicken and some other items that I can not remember the name of. . .they were all surpisingly on point!  One of my friends actually had an issue with the texture of his pork dish. . .and you know what?  I tried it and honestly. . .the texture of the fake pork was the texture of the real pork in the same dish in other chinese restaurants I had before.  The texture tended to be a little on the chewy side and Veggie House was True to form. . .they made the fake pork like it was supposed to be!  crazy. . .crazy delicious!!  =)  On my second trip. . .i had their crispy beef again. . .and it did not disappoint. . .it was so good!!  Loved it!  I also had their Cilantro salad. . .and OMG. . .if you are a cilatnro fan like me. . .you will love this salad.  They chopped cilantro tossed it in a soy sauced vinegrette with a slgiht kick and mixed it with slices of pressed tofu and some fried eggroll skins for texture. . .it was freaking delicious!  I could eat it everyday and I probably would not get tired of it.  =)  I also had their Roti with curry which the serve told me was one of their more popular apps. . .this was one of the dishes that I did not like as much.  The roti was awesome!  BUT the curry was a little on the too sweet side for me.  As I progressed and ate more of the curry. . .the flavors did deepen and I was able to taste more of the nuances of the dish. . .but the sweetness lasted througout and it kind of made it weird for me.  This was the only dish that I had that was NOT a 5 star dish.    Ambiance. . .(4/5)  It's a little weird inside as it reminds me of huts with straw roofs. . .but for the most part I can ignore it and just focus on the great food.  =)  Service. . .very prompt and very cordial (5/5).  Now if all vegan places tasted as good as Veggie House. . .I could be a vegan but until that time I will enjoy my vegan meals here. . .and enjoy the real stuff elsewhere.  =)  I will definitely be back!",

What I love about the menu is that there are all these meat alternatives to your favorite dishes like orange chicken and broccoli beef, but without the meat! It is amazing how fresh, expedient, and delicious the food looks. I literally only wait 5 minutes from order to meal. It really amazes me.   If you want to try out these dishes, come during lunch! For $8.99 you get a side vegetable soup before your meal comes out. I recommend adding some chili sauce. If you want an alternative to the traditional plain brown rice, Veggie's House's version includes the red rice in the brown rice for a more nutritious and colorful meal.   The staff has always been very friendly with a smile and there are always customers from all backgrounds, language abilities, and ages eating inside. This makes for a comfortable experience to see the diversity of the world eating great food with you. I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

Ying, one of the staff members seemed to be in charge of refilling water. She stopped at many of the tables including ours. She was so sweet and bubbly and energetic!

We get seated right away. It was a busy day because of Father's Day. So we didn't mind the wait. The place was decorated with one theme: Green haha. Very cramped space but they make it work for what space they got!  You can tell there were tourists here as well. Most likely looking for healthy options outside the strip. So one cool thing is that they have WiFi! So I logged on there to make sure I get my check in for yelp.  The staff was very attentive. They got us waters immediately and made sure to ask if we had any questions. We scanned the menu and everything looked delicious on there. We got the orange beef, a kung pao combo and a seaweed soup.   My my my my goodness. First of all, the soup was delicious. It had tofu bits and seaweed. Great flavoring, not over seasoned and not too salty. Perfection and delicious. The orange beef, had a crunch and the texture was nearly the same as beef. A dish well done. You dont even realize its not beef. So for you carnivores out there, it's doable to have a veggie dish once in awhile. haha.   I'll definitely come back!",

And you would not be able to tell the difference until you start chewing it.. and even then, it's still so delicious!!!  We were there for lunch and ordered from the lunch special menu. I was very surprised at the size of their lunch portions. I could not finish my order.  They even have vegan desserts... It's a complete vegan heaven, I tell you! We'll definitely be coming back to try the other dishes... They even make vegan sushi!!!",

    "text": "Vegetarian?! No, but the family decide to stop by this place base on the reviews from yelp and plus we've been consuming not the healthiest of food.  Generally speaking, I consider myself an avid for vegetarian  food. I love it cause it tastes the same if made correctly.  Veggie House is on the second floor of what I think is a plaza of China Town. Plenty of parking, plus there is a structure behind the plaza. Parked near the supermarket, it's almost directly over it.   We ordered: 1. Orange chicken (from the popular list): Has a spicy chili mark, but it isn't spicy. The \"chicken\" is soft and outside crunchy. The ratio of crunch to \"meat\" was perfect.   2. Kung Pao combo: Perfect ratio/consistency of \"chicken\" cashew red/green pepper, and peanuts. Not spicy, but watch the chilis inside! Super tasty!  3. Honey walnut shrimp: The \"shrimp\" was a little too powdery for me. However, the walnuts were perfect. Portion was on point.  4. Spicy beef:  The seasoning was awesome. Had a touch if peanuts over the top. The texture was superb. One of my favorite dish I personally thought.   5. House pan fried noodle: The portion was the same as any other restaurant. A little bland I thought, but it had all the veggies the way it suppose to be.   Overall, a great experience. Definitely would come back and try different dishes the next time that I'm in town!",

I was brought here by my mother who always encourages me to eat healthy lol... And being the die hard yelper that I am, how could I turn down her invitation to this restaurant hahaha!!! Upon entering we were greeted and sat quickly due to the low volume of customers at the time. It seems to me that we have a rather great sense of timing when dining out lol. The restaurant is very clean and has a very relaxing environment which I appreciate with all the hustle and bustle here in Las Vegas. We were given a few minutes to look over the menu and while browsing through it I was in complete amazement. Being this is a vegan chinese restaurant I would've never thought to see items such as roast pork, curry duck, and even honey walnut shrimp! And it's all vegan!!!  You probably can feel my excitement by just reading this hahaha.  I ordered the house fried rice which consists of shrimp, chicken, ham, and veggies. My mom ordered braised tofu stir fry which consists braised tofu, baby bok choy cabbage, shitake mushrooms, and snow peas. It was served with a side of brown and red jasmine rice. Also had an order of spring rolls to start. The prices varies depending on what you order, I do think it's reasonable especially when you want some delicious vegan food. Overall experience the food was absolutely delicious! Compliments to the chefs!  Service was a bit lacking. Basically weren't checked on throughout our entire meal which is the reason for the 4*. I do recommend if you have the opportunity to visit this restaurant take it, you will definitely forget that the food is vegan! I am really looking forward to my next visit!",

We came for lunch and the lunch prices were cheap (on the order of $9) for well portioned entrees. Lunch also comes with a veggie tofu soup.   We ordered the soft eggplant, orange chicken(crispy on the outside but so soft on the inside), beef broccoli, and Kung Pao chicken. My family loved all the dishes. It was definite worth the extra lyft ride from the strip. Everything is vegan here!   Being lactose intolerant, I was also so excited to be able to enjoy a Thai tea here too. It was a peaceful, delicious escape from the craziness of Vegas!",

I'm from NJ/NYC and reminded me of a traditional restaurant I'd find in Chinatown but 1000x's cleaner.  Nowhere near close to considering myself vegan, but I do like to stay away from meat periodically. Had the house pan fried noodles (flavors were amazing especially if you like garlic), lettuce wraps (great low carb option with tons of flavor), and the salt & pepper veggie rib strips (least favorite but still good).  Service was great. Restaurant clean. Easiest 5 star rating I've given in a long time.",

    "text": "While in Las Vegas, the wife and I were looking for vegan restaurants and came upon this one after some searching.  Location & Aesthetics -- located off W Spring Mountain Road at the corner of S Edmond Street and was very easy to find.  However, once you get to this little plaza, you will think you're in little Chinatown in Las Vegas.  Within this plaza are numerous Chinese restaurants, businesses, and a Chinese grocery store.  The restaurant was almost difficult to find but we called and they directed us to the front door. The restaurant is located upstairs, to the right of the grocery store.  There is a small stairwell to the right of the grocery store that leads you right to the front door of the restaurant. The restaurant had good signage but could be missed or mixed up with all of the other restaurants around.  Do note, the other restaurants around aren't vegetarian so that helps in a way. Lots of available parking though it is shared by numerous businesses.   Exterior of the restaurant was clean as well as the interior plus it was very well lit and cool/comfortable.     Service -- as we entered, we were greeted by the staff and were immediately seated with menus, and also immediately asked what we would like to drink.  Seeing as we're new vegans, we asked for iced water but was even recommended a number of teas if we would like.   We perused the menus and ordered appetizers -- roti with curry (see below for description).  Appetizers were quickly brought to the table so service was prompt.   For other menu suggestions, the staff provided many recommendations which we were grateful for.  Wait times for the main courses were very short which was very admirable.  Menu -- menu was available via their website, even with accompanying photos which in my opinion is always appreciated plus the menus in the restaurant was descriptive.  Any questions we had about menu items were answered promptly, professionally and courteously.  Food -- for the appetizer, we had the roti and curry.  The roti was very hot, tender and easy to break apart, not too oily/greasy, fresh, not burnt, and melted in your mouth.  The curry wasn't too thick or watery and was seasoned just right with the right amount of seasonings and wasn't spicy but also very hot as well.   For the main course, I had the spicy crispy beef on the lunch menu with came with either white or brown rice and soup of the day.  I wasn't sure what exactly was the soup of the day or what it consisted of but it was very delicious, well seasoned, and very hot and soothing. The spicy crispy beef along with the brown rice was phenomenal.  The brown rice was steamed very well, not too dry or too moist but sticky enough to get between your chopsticks.  The spicy beef was cooked very well and looked and tasted like beef even though it was 100% vegetarian, and it had a slight kick to it but nothing to make the nose runny.  Very tasty!  If you're vegan and you're in Las Vegas, do give this place a try.  I definitely recommend them and I would certainly be back to try some of their other menu items.",

I was in the area so I stopped by for some take-out. It was a little hard to find with my gps telling me to go right, uhhh....I got lost so I called the restaurant. They're located upstairs in the corner to the left of the strip mall.  I looked at menu. I was soo excited I wanted everything on the menu. The worker, Jeremy I think his name was was soo nice and patient.  I told him it was my first time there. I ended up ordering the fresh coconut in a cup, fried rice and orange chicken. It was Fantastic! Nice portion size and flavor.   The second time there, I took a friend. We dined in. Again, I was excited. We ordered the crunchy roll, beef, fried eggplants and walnut shrimp. Crunchy roll and beef was great! Eggplant and shrimp were ok. Our server didn't seem to know what was going on. She didn't speak English. Service was a little slow. I wish we had Jeremy as our server.   All in all, I would definitely eat here again. I can't wait to try other things on the menu.",

My friend ordered a banana crepe with peanut butter ice cream on top and I got the cheesecake with vanilla ice cream on top. We loved both dishes. I will definitely be returning!",

We ordered the Beef and Broccoli, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the General Tso.  Both the 'chicken' dishes were incredible!  Haven't ever had such spot on vegan chicken.  We were impressed.  The Beef and Broccoli I wouldn't order again.  It was alright, the 'beef' was really soft and chewy.  I believe it was seitan based but I like mine slightly more firm.     Our service was friendly and polite.  Everything is 100% vegan unless you choose to add egg to certain dishes.  Feel like they could do without that option for vegan sanity haha.  Generous portions.     We will be back.",

We had the crispy spicey eggplant and salt and pepper fish.   The crispy spicey eggplant is good! But its not something I would eat all by myself xD that's why I think it's a great dish to use for family styled meals! The salt and pepper fish was tasted good too, but it's vegan so I don't really know what kind of replacement is usually in those but I'd order it again!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I would most likely stop by here again!  Oh yeah. P.S. the customer service was really good! The employees were extremely nice, but that could have been just because we were their first custumers of the day and nobody had time to Piss them off yet.",

The food here was great and left our stomachs satisfied without feeling heavy.   Some vegetarian places can have bland dishes but everything at Veggie House was delicious! All the dishes had great flavors that you would expect at a top notch Chinese restaurant. We had the honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, crispy eggplant, crispy beef, lo mein noodles, and sweet and sour pork. Although there is no actual chicken, beef or pork in these dishes, they could of had us fooled. My favorite dish was the crispy spicy eggplant and crispy spicy beef. There was a satisfaction with every crunch of the eggplant and beef.   I definitely recommend this place to whoever wants a delicious and light meal. The service was super friendly and the prices are affordable. We went during happy hour so the prices were even better. Some of the dishes we ordered were from the happy hour menu so they come out smaller but 6 dishes total were able keep a table of 9 content and satisfied. Definitely recommend this place!",

This place's food is so good after being there 3 times, I still randomly will stop my daily activities and crave the walnut shrimp. The food sizes are great for the money and the food is heaven sent. I'm actually offended this place isn't 5 stars already, but that's why I'm writing this review.   I eat vegan around the United States (being in a touring band) and this place is THE best. I miss it, and if I didn't live in Chicago I would be there right now.   Do me a favor and stop by the veggie house if you're even SLIGHTLY considering it. You need to experience this.",

The restaurant is located in shopping plaza on the second floor. The plaza is caters mostly to Asian eateries and services...super cute. Nevertheless I ordered the Crispy 'Beef' and Pad Thai. The Crispy 'Beef' was amazing and the Pad Thai was yummy as well. The Paid Thai came with veggies and what looked like 'shrimp'. The 'shrimp' had the taste and texture of real shrimp. The only reason I didn't give Veggie House 5 stars is because you cannot order a la carte. The meals were a bit pricey, but you get enough to feed at lease 2 people. I will order from them again, but I will dine in next time I am in Vegas. The staff was friendly, food came fast and the taste was better than I anticipated. Thank you Veggie House!",

It came with a refreshing soup reminiscent of an egg drop soup but with tofu. The General chicken arrived and looked like chicken, tasted like chicken, even smelled like chicken.  I have no idea what the \"chicken\" was made out of and had to ask several times if it was in fact...chicken.  This same analysis was conducted will sampling the GF's \"beef\" and broccoli.

The last time we were in LV, it was 2009 and this restaurant was not here, I believe.  Wow, we like it a lot that we went twice during the 3 days we were in LV.  Dishes were so good.  They have a 'BALANCED' taste.  The sweet is not too sweet, the salty taste is not too salty, and the sour taste is not too sour.  I don't know how to describe it but they taste well balanced.  The sign of good food is that you can't stop eating.  That's how it was with my experience.  Every bite was followed by another bite since I wanted more and more.  We finished all of our lunch order dishes. For us the best one was the Crispy Oyster Mushroom with Lemongrass sauce.  Because of this dish, my husband wanted to go back to the restaurant instead of trying other vegan places in LV.  I did try bravely to have the seaweed stems.  Surprisingly, they were good.  The Crispy Eggplants and Crispy Beef dishes were also delicious but we prefer the Crispy Oyster Mushrooms dish.  The price was also so reasonable for lunch specials.  The service was attentive and friendly.  I wish that I can try more dishes before we left but we only have one stomach and only a few chances to dine here.  We will come back to this place again when we have a chance in the future.  I hope that this place will continue and be successful.",

My friend had the Crispy \"Beef\". I had a few pieces of that but it was too spicy for me (I'm a HUGE spice wimp so it doesn't take much). We  try new dishes each time now. The noodles are great!  The desserts are fabulous!    The only thing I haven't completely cared for is the Eggplant with Tofu. The flavor is good but the tofu was too soft.    They may need a bigger location soon because there can be a wait but the food is worth it.  I absolutely LOVE this place!!",

Otherwise, it'll be a bust. My first visit was fabulous. I ordered the bean curd with bamboo flowers and vegetables and also got to sampled the lemongrass and mushrooms dish. They were both excellent!  On my second visit, I asked for the hot and spicy Szechuan tofu. Personally I don't like non-fried tofu so I made sure to ask if the tofu in this dish is fried. There's definitely a language barrier between me and the server as she nodded her head and said yes to my question. When the dish arrived, it was a mass of white and mushy tofu cubes in a brown sauce. Clearly the tofu was cooked, not fried. After I clarified that I wanted it fried, the dish turned out okay. There wasn't any vegetables in this dish, just tofu in a sauce. Hence, this dish was as boring as it can be. Pass.  My friends all enjoyed their food. One ordered the beef and broccoli and the other ordered the lemon chicken. We're probably coming back to try other items.",

They refilled drinks promptly, they took requests for sharing plates and napkins quickly. It truly was a great first experience.  I've heard great things about \"fake meat\". I've heard that their are delicious fried chicken sandwiches at Veggie places that rival the real thing.  I willingly tried out veggie house for lunch with two friends.  They have a large menu of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Many of them feature tofu, veggies, and \"fake meat\". Sorry I can't figure out a better sounding phrase.  Anyways their lunch special comes with soup, brown or white rice, and an entree. I don't remember the price but the lunch portions of the items were big! I want to say it was $7-$8 for their lunch special.  Between the here of us we had beef and broccoli, Kung pao beef, and their famous crispy beef.  All of the entrees were served with their traditional veggies. Like the Kung pao had water chestnuts, onions, ect,  The veggies on my beef and broccoli were a large portion. All of their ingredients are fresh.   And let me get to the meat. Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.  Last we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.  Am I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good? Yes!   This is a five star restaurant. Good service, good food quality, unique, good prices, clean.",

I saw crispy beef and pork and scallops and my head almost exploded. I bought the Crispy Noodle Fried Scallops and they are to die for. I couldn't handle it. I was in heaven.   My boyfriend eats meat but got the honey walnut shrimp. I think he was expecting it to taste like the stuff from Panda Express but the sauce was a little different and he wasn't a fan. More for me, I was so happy.  The second time we went, he ordered the orange crispy beef and I ordered the crispy scallops again. I was just as happy as the first time but ended up eating all of my boyfriend's food again. That crispy beef reminds me of jerky, but less chewy. Crispy, thin, and DELICIOUS.  It still astounds me how they can offer so many vegetarian options, all that actually sound appealing. I went to the market underneath them (as they are upstairs) and they actually do sell vegetarian meat substitutes in there. I can't make it as good as the people at the Veggie House, so I will definitely continue to come back.   Also, the servers are always so sweet!!",

If you're in Vegas and you're vegetarian or vegan and you're having a hard time finding fulfillment at the buffet, do yourself a huge favor and goo to veggie house.  Hell, if you eat meat go here and try their food also, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is. I'm vegetarian, my wife and mother in law are omnivores, I let them taste some of my food and they thought it was meat. I ordered the bbq \"pork\" appetizer,  it was smoky and salty, very reminiscent of the original. I also had the honey walnut \"shrimp\" which in my opinion was better than the original. Lastly, I ordered the spicy crispy \"beef\", it came with broccoli and toasted peanuts on the top. AMAZING! best of all besides how insanely delicious it is, is the fact that no creature had to suffer for my sustenance. Like I said please go, take your friends, take your family, and take strangers too! Lol! I ordered take out. Next time I'm in town I'll have to sit down and enjoy the ambience. Enjoy!",

Regardless, this is a place I otherwise would not have known about let alone gone to, had it not come up on my favorite green website.  After extensively perusing reviews here and the menu online, I finally went in to order my takeout- wonton ramen soup, spicy crispy eggplant with brown rice, and green tea ice cream with sticky rice.  The spicy crispy eggplant is out of this world. It's amazing, and I'd come back just for this dish- side of brown rice wasn't even necessary. Delicious way to have eggplant, and despite being a sticky and almost sweet sauce it did not feel like a heavy meal.   The won ton soup was a bit underwhelming. I did appreciate how the noodles were packed separately for my takeout order so as not to fall apart in the broth, and I liked the won tons themselves. But the broth was lacking. I liked the green taste to it, and it oddly reminded me of a green smoothie, except in broth form. As in, you could taste the veggie vibrancy. But it was still somehow flat. Noodles were also much thinner than I prefer, and seemed to simply be thin spaghetti rather than ramen.  The dessert was underwhelming as well. The green tea ice cream melted very quickly and was also lacking in flavor- I've experienced varieties with more of a chalky texture but stronger machta taste, but this version was on the thin side rather than creamy. Also struck me as odd that the sticy rice was orange.",

It isn't always easy to find good vegan food around. I came to Veggie House with my best friends. A married vegan couple and my 8 year old omnivorous daughter. We were seated immediately and helped at once by our server,  Don. The menus stated on them \"Proud to be Vegan\". My friend, still skeptical about the menu asked a lot of questions to our server, Don. Don was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and spoke not only patiently, but enthusiastically about the menu. It was apparent that he was proud of the establishment he worked for. What a breath of fresh air! He was very kind. My daughter tried so hard to use her chopsticks, but couldn't master it. Another sweet lady server came by our table and made a sort of \"chopstick trainer for her\". It was very nice. We ordered and shared 5 entrees between us. The portion size was great and the food was delicious! My daughter especially liked the orange \"chicken\". She said it was just as good as \"regular chicken\". Well done Veggie House. Especially Don. He's a keeper!",

About 7 hours after finishing my meal, I woke up at 3:30 am, and for the next 24 hours I endured what I thought was Giardia, Cdiff, Cholera, E. Coli, you name it.

Since going back to vegetarianism a few months ago, Veggie House has been there for me and I'm always excited to treat myself here! You are seated very quickly, orders are accurate, servers are polite, food is delicious, and I've never once left feeling dissatisfied. What does that tell ya?!  So far, I've ordered all of the stereotypical 'Chinese' dishes and have yet to be disappointed. I can't wait to come back, branch out, and order something I won't see at a Panda Express. Lol. My favorites have been the house fried rice (Asian food necessity), pan fried fish (crispy and flavorful) and the orange chicken (of course, of course). If you order beef or shrimp, you'll find that the texture is closer to tofu but it's delicious nonetheless. Oh! Unless it's the crispy beef... That stuff is so spot on that I'm afraid it's real!  I've also brought my meat-loving family members here and they were impressed! It's always nice to look at a menu and not have to feel like your options are limited. I'm very glad this establishment exists, and I will always be coming back!",

Service was friendly and attentive and the handmade food came to us at a good pace.  They have a huge menu that invites repeat visits. We started with the fried wonton appetizer, it was great and a sign that everything coming from the kitchen is made with attention and love. For Main dishes the Orange \"Chicken\" was amazing, the crispy eggplant, delicious and unique, and an excellent tofu and veggie dish.   The best and most memorable meal I had while in Vegas.",

I could probably be happy with everything on the menu but, on my visit, I quickly selected the tofu skin salad and veggie geese.  I hadn't had tofu skin in years so I was glad that they prepared it as I remembered it.  It was so good.  When I'm passing through Las Vegas, I'll definitely pay another visit to Veggie House.",

Their vege duck has unbelievably realistic texture and appearance and they add  a slight smoky flavor.   They also have a large dessert selection.   The decor and ambiance is not much.    But the quality of the food and reasonable prices are a great deal.   Will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas.",

However, the service is not up to standard. I found this restaurant because of Groupon and I have been turned away twice trying to use the Groupon.   The first time I was told I couldn't use the deal with the lunch special which is annoying but understandable. The 2nd time I was told that I couldn't use it because I ordered online. I didn't pay online, I was going to pay in cash. The owner said that I couldn't use the Groupon and told me to call Yelp about it, he kept my food and told me to come back if I figured it out.   To me it would have been simple to re-ring the order and not waste the food but he just told me to leave. I still have the Groupon and I will go back once more because of that but I won't be eating here anymore. There is another all vegan restaurant of a similar style near by so I will try them out. It's a shame too because the food is excellent and I was even excited to try the chef's new location but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. As a business, If you only want to participate in services like Yelp,Eat24 and Groupon for the publicity and you aren't really interested in honoring the deals then you really should just by a commercial.",

    "text": "ahhh man....I was so excited after reading the reviews that I think my expectations were too high. I am from an area in southern California that has a lot of vegan options so I have had really fantastic vegan food. Plus I personally make 3 meals a day for my family so I used to eating clean healthy food. I was very disappointed with my experience here. When I walked in I was greeted and seated immediately. It was a typical Vegas hot day so I was super thirsty. After being seated we didn't even get water till at least 10min after being seated. The waitress and chef were so interested in schmoozing with customers they knew rather than being attentive to new customers. After stressing that I REALLY would like some water my waitress brought a full pitcher of water to what I thought was going to be my table but instead filled the glasses of the table next to me! really?!  In addition to no meat or diary my family also avoids oil. So I told the waitress to have my meal made w little oil as possible. One dish came back un-edible. The reason I didn't give a one star rating was because the chef immediately scooped that dish off our table and had them make us another dish. The second dish was good except why all the sauce? It was more like a soup dish than a noodle dish. My recommendation would be to ask for ALL sauces on the side. They completely saturate their dishes in sauce and its like eating soup. too bad.... I will not go back here nor would I recommend it unless you are ok with fried, oily, sauce saturated meals.   It was also a turn off to see the chef pull up a chair and sit with customers bragging about himself. If you are a regular and you know the chef then you are definitely treated more special. If you are not  or are from out of town prepare to get the stink eye and treated like an annoyance.",

The only problem was it was cut in 5 pieces and I thought my husband was going to stab my hand when I went for the 3rd piece.  Brown rice is the usual, not extra or poorly cooked.  We loved the eggplant and the soft and egg tofu.   Can I just add that we have since tried the Mongolian beef which was very tasty and the spicy scallop which was outstanding. You have to try this even if you are not vegan. We do go here at least twice a month. We have the oyster mushroom in Lemon Grass sauce every time.  We have been back with our favorite vegan friend and she ordered the Orange Chicken. She loved it. I got to try it. It was so much better than Panda or the like. And it wasn't chicken. It tasted like real oranges!!",

Upon entering the restaurant, I was sure to inform her that we(my partner and I) wanted to redeem our groupon so any necessary preparations could be made. She interrupted snarkily and asked us if we wanted to dine in or dine out in such a manner that it seemed as though she was annoyed with us already, although we had only been in the restuarant about 5 minutes or so. After opting to dine in, she \"led\", which is a nice way of saying scurried along hurriedly while expecting us to keep pace with her rushing to get us out of her hair, to a table and then proceeded to toss our menus onto the table(not an exaggeration, she literally threw them onto the table), point to our seats and promptly walk off.  Our waitress, on the other hand was wonderful: friendly, professional, and courteous. Unfortunately, our prior encounter with the hostess made us reluctant to stay there, and I informed her that we would like to change our order to take out.  After awkwardly having to deal with the hostess, who by this time was almost giving us the ice cold \"I can't believe you changed your order, make up your mind, I hate customers like you\" stare, we then sat there for the next 15-20 minutes for the food. Soon before we left, the hostess begins to seem amiable, and attempted to make small conversation with my partner and I. At this point we were beyond frustrated and upset, so we were not receptive to her advances.   What a shame, because when I finally got to the car to try my food, it was absolutely delicious! I'm not sure I would give this place another visit again, but if you're willing to try some good food with some bad service, give this spot a shot.",

Everyone was super nice. We ordered iced tea and a Pepsi and got the lunch special of General Tzo, Sweet and Sour Chix and Beef & Broccoli. Wow wow wow. Everything was super quite tasty and I honestly could not tell it wasn't \"real\" meat. Not sure what they use, surely doesn't taste like tofu but it's unbelievable.

    "text": "My friend recommended this place. We were within 45 minutes of closing so we decided to get take-out, but they were willing to seat us. First, let me say that everyone there was SO nice. They gave us sit-down menus, all the time we needed and answered any questions. Jeffery, at the front, was excellent and very friendly. The menu has a large variety and so many things looked so good! It's all vegan and they have many variations on meat dishes.   I got a few things: the Hot and Sour soup was very flavorful and a just the right amount of spice to it. The to go portion was huge! A great value.    Spring rolls were still crisp and warm after 30 minutes of driving. The typical sweet orange sauce comes with it. The filling was varied and blended very well.   The fried veggie dumplings were good. Very fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked. In some places, the dipping sauce that comes with it is a little thicker, but it was still nice to have.   The Braised Tofu with Vegetables dish was good. The tofu is in larger pieces than I've seen elsewhere, but it's correctly cooked and delicious.   I definitely recommend this place! I looked into the restaurant area and it looked cute and clean.  I can't wait to go back and try the orange chicken!",

    "text": "In Vegas for the weekend with my family (husband and two small children). There are SO many vegan options in Vegas which is fantastic but this place is BY FAR the best vegan place I have ever been to. In Vegas or otherwise... First, the menu seems to have almost unlimited options, with all your 'old favorites'.  Can make it a little hard to decide what to get, but I think that's a pretty good problem to have, especially when I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.   My husband ended up getting the Kung Pao that came with beef, chicken and shrimp. We were immediately amazed at how real the shrimp looked and tasted. The portion was very generous, and there was tons of everything, including veggies. My husband asked to have the dish made mild in spice and they graciously made the change. It did not sacrifice the flavor at all!!   I got the spicy crispy beef and it was life changing! The 'beef' was sliced thin, fried and then tossed in the most amazing and flavorful sauce, all topped with crushed peanuts and a side of steamed broccoli. The texture and flavor was amazing and I ate almost every bite even though I was stuffed.  We also ordered the house fried rice for the kids and it came with chicken, shrimp and ham. Along with a bunch of veggies and pineapple. Again, incredibly yummy! The kids both enjoyed it and ate many helpings of it.   All of this and it doesn't even touch on the great service. They are attentive, kind, patient and very speedy. What more could you ask for. From the moment we got there we felt welcome and taken care of. We were in a little bit of a hurry, not that we said that or anything, and we were in and out in less than 45min.   Truly could not say more positive things about this place! We will surely be back!!!!!!",

It's so crazy to think that I can get some vegan Chinese food that tastes even better than regular Chinese food and won't make you feel greasy and gross. We are always greeted by friendly servers and always seated right away, even though it gets pretty packed here! Our go to is the Pan Fried Noodles and the Orange Chicken with Brown Rice. I kid you not, my bf & I agree that it is probably the best Pan Fried Noodles in all of Vegas - and it's VEGAN! Those two dishes are a definite must try, especially if you're a first timer. I brought some of the orange chicken home and my mom couldn't even tell that it was vegan haha!   They also have a Groupon deal that they always honor, but it isn't valid on their lunch specials. (Speaking of Groupon: we are already on our third Groupon account because we maxed out the other accounts on getting the Veggie House Groupon. Goes to show how much we go here and love this place! Haha).   Lunch is from 11:30am-3:30pm daily and they are closed for break from 3:30pm-4:30pm.   Seriously go here if you're looking to try some vegan Chinese food! I'm getting hungry thinking about their pan fried noodles again lol.",

The food was very fresh and delicious. The chef is excellent and every dish we got tasted amazing. I would die a happy man if we had a place like this in NYC.

I ordered takeout, it was about 3:15 the lady took my order got my name and number and told me my food would be ready 10-15 minutes. It takes me 15 minutes to get there so I left my house right away. I got upstairs to the restaurant at 3:36, doors are locked and I see a sign on the door that they are closed for an hour 3:30-4:30!!! I tried to call a few times with no success, voicemail every time. I was very hungry so I left a message to cancel my order and I was going somewhere else. The lady calls me back when the restaurant is open to tell me my food was ready?!?! I repeatedly tried explaining how I already came to the restaurant and the doors were locked and I left a vm canceling my order. She said yes but your food is ready now! She didn't understand why I was upset or why I didn't want to drive back and pick up the order that I canceled!",

The first time I ever had there food, it was the peppered steak and I ate it all, before my husband told me it was all vegan! I was hooked!  Our favorites include Kenny's spinach salad, crispy beef, lotus root cakes, broccoli beef and sweet and sour pork.  The staff is always super friendly and they will always help you with the menu. It is always a good time when you go there too, because Kenny will always come out and talk to you. If it's not too busy he will sit down at your table. His story is really amazing and he is a super guy! If you have been there a few times and have a feel for the menu, you can tell Kenny what you like and he will make you food based on what you tell him! We have had him do that twice with the chow main noodles, and we have yet to be disappointed! If chef Kenny ever gets on the Food Network or the Travel Channel WATCH OUT because he will explode! His food is so YUMMY! If I could do what he does in the kitchen, there is no question that my family and I would all be enjoying the vegan lifestyle!!!",

Every time I've come in with my young son, they always say something -- either about him making a mess, or him playing with the chop sticks.  This last time we went, one even went to take away his chopsticks he was entertaining himself with and when I asked her if he could keep them she didn't quite understand?- and then said, \"Well, you have to watch him because I don't want him to get hurt.\"  Uhhhh....?

Everything was at least $10 except the soups that were around $6.  The waitresses spoke to us in Chinese; however I felt that they didn't understand what we said or ordered because they got our order wrong and could not understand when we asked for a container for soup and a plastic spoon in Chinese.  They seemed more fluent in Cantonese I don't see why we couldnt just communicate in English.  The food was also very salty. Everything we ordered was super salty almost unbearable.  What really got me was how overpriced these plates were. Being Taiwanese Chinese and vegetarian for 3 years, I can vouch that other chinese vegetarian places would not charge as much.  Theyre usually around $8 per plate and for a plate of steamed veggies would NOT be $14! It would be much cheaper than the regular plate, around $6-7.",

    "text": "OMG, I'm kind of sad, my original review didn't post :( Got to keep hitting that save button.   I love that there are a few vegetarian joints located in Chinatown.  I was excited to try this place out since I had scored an awesome deal on Groupon.   My hubby is a meat-head (LOL), as am I, but I like having vegetarian options and like to taste how people get creative with vegetables.    Its a nice cozy little place that has delightful, attentive workers, and when we were there, we saw Chef Kenny making his rounds at the tables.  I like when the restaurants do that, gives you a lot of appreciation of whats about to go down in your tummy.  I heard Chef Kenny say to the couple he was speaking to about how he employs chefs that are also vegetarian.  Guess to be okay of the veggies plates you're preparing, you should be a vegetarian yourself, Hehe.    There are TV sets on each side of the room that display the varieties that they serve here.  So you won't be completely lost about all the faux on faux on faux they got here.    My hubby and I tried the Shark Fin soup, Oyster Mushroom with Lime Grass, and the Spicy Beef.  Soup was okay, a bit salty for me, the other 2 dishes were bursting with flavor.  BUT they were both fried and the flavor from one of the dishes was drenched in sauce.  Veggies=good, Fried, not so much.  That was my bad.  I was so intrigued about all these dishes I forgot to order up some clean eats.  Ooops.    Great, clean restaurant to be recommended to vegetarians.  I'll be back to try some non-fried dishes.",

How many restaurants have we been to where the only thing we could eat on the menu was the salad? (Hold the chicken please) The service is friendly, the place is clean, and even the other patrons were pleasant to be around. We ordered the 'duck' with pineapple, and the classic orange 'chicken'. I put quotes cause I don't really know what you'd call the imitation version of that, but it was just that and it was amazing.  Maybe it had been a long time since either of us ate meat, but when my friend first tried her dish, she stopped and looked at it weird, cause she thought it was real meat. The server assured us everything was vegetarian and then I proceeded to make fun of her the rest of the night for it. I can't pinpoint how close to the \"real\" thing it may be, but nonetheless the food is delicious in it's own right and deserves a try at least once.",

But only because I barely touched the Sizzling Shrimp Plate, which I might add was not sizzling upon its arrival (that's the fun & exciting part of watching your food come to the table, but this wasn't the case here)  Kung Pao Chicken: did have some good flavors, we requested a 8/10 in the spice level but it was probably less. It was still good but not worth coming back for in my opinion.  Sizzling Shrimp Plate: All of it tasted like it was probably steamed for a few seconds then maybe sauteed after in a very flavorless sauce. It was undercooked and almost raw, lacked flavor, and the faux shrimp had an odd texture.  I am sad to say that I did not enjoy it at all like I thought I would.",

I haven't had a bad dish from Chef Kenny. We've had general tso chicken, kung pao chicken, mushroom chicken, crispy beef, salt and pepper fried fish, roast pork, roti with curry, the happy roll, and their house veggie soup. Also vegan cheesecake and ice cream and Thai tea! Everything, and I mean everything, tastes amazing. Every time we eat here we want to try something new because everything sounds so good, but the last thing we had was so good we want to get it again!!!   I think if I had to recommend or choose my absolute favorite (so far) would be the roti with curry as an app and the General tso chicken and a Thai tea.",

The texture and flavor of the vegan \"schmeat\" (soy meat) dishes was remarkably difficult to differentiate from actual meat. Nice heat to the spicy dishes without compromising other flavors, and the lotus cakes (a personal favorite dish) were a cut above average, lovely balanced and nutty, sweet flavor, perfect texture.  The presentation was simple and satisfying, a few vivid orchids, thoughtful placement, simple white plates.  The prices were not especially low or high for a vegan place, and the chef came out to meet us--he was a gracious and courteous host, excited about his recipes and pleased to meet his patrons.  All in all, this was a lovely dinner experience.",

My husband and I bought a KSHP voucher for here, called ahead to check hours and that there were no holiday restrictions on using the voucher (none were written on the certificate itself, but I always double check) so we made plans to have a date night here. When we arrived, I presented the voucher (which you have to do at any business that uses them), we were seated and all was well. Only after being seated did a female server come tot he table and tell us that we couldn't use the voucher. She wouldn't tell us why we couldn't and flat out told us that we could call the radio station if it was a problem for us, because it wasn't her problem! We left and will NOT be returning. I don't care how good the food may have been, there's always another great place to eat in Vegas. And there's never an excuse for rudeness like that. THUMBS DOWN.",

Although I'm not a vegetarian, the food is amazing and a fun twist on popular foods like orange chicken. (Not real meat) The atmosphere is nice and peaceful. Not too quiet nor loud. Just the perfect touch of serenity from the fountain display and background noise from satisfied customers. The servers are very friendly. Loud and ecstatic! I get how some might mistaken their energy as something not positive and a little overpowering but coming from a Chinese background I know loud=happy and excited. I brought my friends here and they became fans of this treasure too. Left with smiles and a full belly of healthful, vegetarian food!  Suggestions: Orange chicken Crispy, spicy eggplant Happy roll Hot n' sour soup AND THEIR VEGAN ICE CREAM! A little pricey for ice cream but still something I like to end the meal with.  Delicious, nutritious food, friendly service, convenient location...nothing more we could ask for. More regulars to come!",

Well suffice to say everyone was impressed with the taste and presentation.  Being in a big group we had several dishes that I've been craving for since I'm a pescetarian.  We had duck with orange, orange chicken, spicy beef broccoli, low mein, walnut shrimp and desert.  By far one of the best dinners I had in a Chinese restaurant without having the greasy feeling that only a soda can blast through. This place is just a delight and service was nice compared to your typical Chinese restaurant dining experience.",

More than one have said that the orange/general tsao chicken tastes better than the real thing.  Completely impressed that they pulled off just about every Chinese dish to be vegan AND delicious. Blows my mind.  A lot of their food is fried for texture, but often it's hard to tell since they do it so well. Not the healthiest, but definitely hits the spot when you're craving a big, hot meal. Affordable, too.",

    "text": "Veggie House is pure heaven to all long time vegetarians.   Took the family here (two vegetarians and two meat eaters), and everyone loved it. This place is 100% vegetarian, all of their \"meats\" are made from tofu and/or cornstarch. They can also make things egg free as well. The atmosphere was nice and quite and the waitresses were on point about bringing more tea, napkins etc.  The crispy beef is so god damn good. Bomb is an understatement. It looks, smells and tastes like Chinese beef!  The orange chicken was just as good, but I liked the beef better.  Their shrimp looks just like real shrimp and basically has the same texture. I personally wouldn't order it again, I just didn't care for the taste.  The wontons were amazing, I don't know exactly what's in them but they were pretty damn good. We just wished it came with more since there was four of us and we ended up with an odd number.  Tom Yum Soup, never heard of it till then but BEWARE: It is shit your pants spicy! If you enjoy eating hot lava, then you will probably love this soup. But if I were you, I would just spare your butthole the fiery burn that you will inevitably experience later on, and avoid the Tom Yum Soup.  Definitely want to try everything on the menu, the Chef is more like a scientist, I don't know how he does it, but I like it.",

    "text": "\"I CAN'T BELIEVE ITS NOT CHICKEN!\"  Those were my EXACT words when I tried the sesame chicken. This place is definitely worth a try. The chef here is a magician.. its like turning a cow to tofu while still maintaining the same beef texture. Neat-o! Overall the quality of the food was good however the flavors were just.. not quite right. Everything tasted like soy sauce to me. The restaurant was super clean and the service was great.   Here's a list of what my friends and I ordered:  Sesame chicken: This was probably my favorite dish. The texture of the 'chicken' and the crunchiness of the coating was really just perfect. The flavor however was a little off for me.  Crunchy spicy eggplant: Definitely a must order.    Pineapple duck: This was probably my least favorite dish. The texture of the 'duck' was alright with me however the flavor tasted a little burnt to me. Can't really describe it but it didn't taste good to me.   Walnut shrimp: One of my favorites from dinner too. Texture was good and flavor was good.",

    "text": "If it looks and tastes like chicken, it must be chicken right? Nope, not here.  The walnut shrimp and the sesame chicken could've fooled a carnivore performing a blind taste test! Their textures were deceptively like their naturally occurring animal counterparts. It probably helped these dishes to fry these meatless morsels in a light batter. The crispy spicy eggplant was cut into perfectly-sized strips and the sauce was spot on. Brown rice is also offered as an option, which is different from most Asian establishments.  As fans of roast duck from Chinese restaurants, my friends and I were intrigued by the pineapple duck and ordered it. Duck is difficult to replicate because of its gamey flavor and texture, so I wasn't expecting much. At first glance, it looked similar; however, at first bite, it was akin to fried tofu that was squished down. In the end, I was mostly put off by the sauce.  The establishment itself is nice and clean with very attentive service. The dishes are well-priced, since my group of four paid about $13 each (including tax and tip). I'd like to try their lunch specials and non-fried dishes too! As someone who won't convert to vegetarianism, I could be tricked into being one at Veggie House.",

Scallop dish was ok but im not a fan of the chewy \"scallops\".

I would definitely like to come back and try it again just for this reason alone.  I'm a meateater. I try to avoid meat, but fake meat just isn't my bag usually. A friend, who is not a meateater, was in town and wanted to give this place a shot. 10% off with Yelp check-in as well which is an extra incentive.  We got some special roll to start with which was very good. We were definitely conned into it by the server, but I didn't mind. She cared so much about whether we were enjoying ourselves and the food! For my entree I got the General Tso chicken, but it was really bland. I wanted to be punched in the mouth with spice and flavor, but I was not. For dessert, I had the vegan ice cream with quinoa. Glad to have ventured to have quinoa with a sweet treat, but I know that I don't like it and won't have it again.   All in all, I want to give this place further investigation.",

It reminded me of tofu, but with a crispy lining which serves as the skin. The sauce was very salty, but was tasty nonetheless. The crispy noodles were good and I have to give props for the shrimp because it looked real and tasted good. My favorite dish is the crispy beef. The taste and texture reminded me of beef, but it didn't have much substance. It was like eating something with a lot of air pockets.   The location is in a plaza with other Asian restaurants. I might give this place another shot and see if their other dishes are good. The overall flavor profile I got from this place is saltiness, but it could have just been due to what I ordered.",

I recommend the Roti curry chicken appetizer. It is the best thing ever... If you like curry. I also had one of the craziest experiences of my life there. They were very busy and did not have enough room to place everybody waiting so we all decided to sit together and they were OK with that. People were from out of country and locals which was a great combo and we got to talk about how amazing vegan food is. Never in my life would I have thought 4 different people... Complete strangers.... would sit together and have a meal.   The food is beyond delicious. They are busy yes, but that is because their food is totally worth it. Nothing like it around.   Recommended over and over again! They even have vegan duck, fish, shrimp and others!   Great \"cheesecake\" and amazing ice cream desserts.. Don't forget to ask for menu too!!",

Ordered us wonton noodle soup, roasted pork, and chicken & mushrooms.  Mind you, I had went to a Korean restaurant to appease my carnivore needs.

    "text": "Since discovering this place, I have been coming once a week. Not because I like soy meat substitutions, but because EVERYONE seems to be fooled by this place (in a good way). I have taken the most stubborn \"omnivores\" that refuse to give veganism a chance here, and they all have loved the food.   My uncles are stubborn eaters that refuse to have a meal without meat or dairy. I brought them here. During the meal, they kept raving about the beef. To this day, they think that it was real beef in their dish. They think the name simply implies that there are a lot of veggies in the dishes haha! I let them think that so that we can still keep eating here.  I brought another friend that asked me to introduce her to good vegan spots around town. We ordered the walnut shrimp, and she was freaking out. She was so confused because I told her this place was fully vegan, yet she just ate shrimp that tasted exactly like shrimp!   These are just a few examples of the experiences I've had at Veggie House. I love bringing new people here and watching their reactions. The food here does a great job at mimicking the traditional non-vegan dishes. I believe that's why this place is always busy.   The cherry on top is the owner, Chef Kenny! If he's around, he will usually come out and chat with each table a bit. He is extremely amicable and always willing to answer any questions a guest might have. I will not name any specific names, but there are other restaurant owners around town that are the complete opposite of Chef Kenny and hide from guests for fear of confrontation. Chef Kenny is a genius and deserves all the success that his many restaurants will bring him!  I would highly recommend Veggie House to anyone and everyone...vegan, vegetarian, omnivore...EVERYONE needs to experience this place! My favorite dishes are the crispy spicy eggplant, walnut shrimp, and flat noodles. Yum!!!",

I was originally planning to come with some vegetarian co-interns, but ended up coming by myself.  The menu is fairly extensive with lots of faux-meat dishes. I ended up ordering the crispy spicy eggplant and roast pork. I will echo some other Yelpers' comments that there are a lot of deep fried foods covered in sauce, so while everything is meatless, it is not necessarily healthy.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed both of my dishes. The crispy spicy eggplant had a nice crisp, but wasn't spicy at all, and a little too sweet (perhaps too much sauce?) for me. Portions were medium, and I was full only after finishing everything. Without my Groupon, the total would have been almost $30 after tax/tips. Thus, Veggie House isn't exactly cheap.  However, service was outstanding. The employees are very friendly and have a lot of pride in their food and this restaurant. They are more than happy to answer questions or explain dishes on the menu.  The interior is pleasant and simple. The food is not bad, and great for your vegetarian/vegan friends. Even meat eaters like me had a good meal here.  P.S. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the shopping plaza.",

I ordered the spicy kung pao beef. The serving was huge. You get alot of food for a reasonable price. I just didn't care for the taste of the food. The beef was good, the chicken was okay, the walnut shrimp was sooo nasty! Omg I could hardly eat it. The dish consisted of some really spicy peppers! The white rice that was served seemed overcooked...it was very sticky. I disliked the food so much I had to go home and eat because I left the restaurant still hungry. The servers were excellent though! They were very helpful and so nice. Overall definitely not would I ever eat here again.",

As stated by many others, the orange chikn is really good.  It doesn't have the light fresh \"orange peel\" taste, but much closer to the classic Chinese take out style.   This is honestly something I miss since going vegan and this checked all the boxes.     Everyone else recommends the pan fried noodles, but if you are like me mock seafood isn't appealing.  I opted for the chow fun w/ \"beef\" and it was excellent.   It is a wet chow fun and the gravy was very flavorful.   The 2 plates were a good size for lunh and I was left with a but of take away.   I will definitely come back on my next trip to vegas.",

The price is average it's not too expensive or cheap. Their menu expanded a bit so there's a huge variety to choose from. I love how they offer brown and white rice with their dishes as well. Their dishes are spectacular this is my go to place when i'm avoiding meat. I've been coming here for 2-3 years now!  Their service is AMAZING and everyone is always so so friendly and happy even when it's crowded. The atmosphere and deco is calming and beautiful. Parking is free and you can access the restaurant by behind parking and front parking as well! I can't wait to go here for lunch to get the special because i've only been here during dinner time.  My favorite is the orange chicken, the pepper salt fish (AMAZING TEXTURE), Kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, Walnut shrimp, Tom yum soup, and crunchy eggplant! Their seaweed stems is so unique as well and i highly recommended trying it because it's so refreshing and different. Every single dish surprises and amazes me every time i try it. It's so flavorful and delicious!!",

We weren't disappointed.  My friend had a fried rice dish and I got some kind of \"chicken\" and mushrooms.  The ginger sauce that came with my dish was phenomenal!  Both dishes came with huge piles of food, and I have to say I finished every bite and was practically licking the plate.  The snow peas, mushrooms and carrots were very fresh.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately we found it late in our stay.  Will make sure it's one of the first places I get to next time I'm in Vegas.",

Most people really love the spicy catfish dish, and while it's really good, it's sometimes a little greasy. Many of the sauces are a little too greasy, but it could be because I am not used to eating such heavy, decadent food. But did I mention Happy Roll? Good, friendly service. You cannot substitute steam veggies for rice, so that's a bummer, but the atmosphere is good, and people are kind, and the menu is extensive.",

Chef Kenny has created such an amazing, healthier approach to foodies like myself who love Chinese food but don't eat meat. I ordered the  Kao Pao 3 and my date had General Tso. I am a General Tso fiend but decided to switch it up and was extremely satisfied. Because I am a fiend for General Tso, I will order that the next time. And trust, there will be many more next times especially since the price is the same price as if it were meat.",

We ordered the general tsao, kung pao beef, chow fun, fried tofu with veggies, and fried brown rice. The food is a good price and delivered in sturdy plastic containers even more friendly for family style to go. Everything was delicious!!! The main dishes came with an order of brown rice. The only dish we werent wild about was the fried brown rice. It was tasteless and tasted like brown rice with pieces of canned pinneapple. Everything was so good we bought it again the next night! General tsao is a solid dish. We liked kung pao better with \"chicken.\" Beef and broccoli was okay.   We've had our try with various veggie friendly places in Vegas and so far... Hands down, this place is def memorable with awesome veggie options.",

I think Chef Kenny puts something in his food that is just addicting and it makes me crave it when I'm home..   We had egg rolls, won ton soup, Kung Pao \"chicken\" and chow fun.. OMG.. I left smiling!   We were laughing later, realizing we dug in without even taking pics of this delicious and nutritious food.. Ok, I admit I'm addicted.

    "text": "Update on Review: Chef Kenny opened \"Chef Kenny's Asian Vegan Restaurant\" and I go there now. The owners and staff are different at Veggie House and the food isn't the same with out Chef Kenny. The crispy beef, sesame Chicken, and salt & pepper tofu was soggy instead of crispy. My husband and I gave the restaurant a few more tries, but the food wasn't on Par. We still appreciate the vegan selections here though.  Older Review:  I am transitioning to 100% Vegan (2 weeks in) and this place is heaven!!! The food is either 100% spot on or 90% close to the real thing. I love the feeling of ordering anything on the menu and NOT having to question \"does it have egg, dairy, or meat\". So far almost everything I've ordered I love. I visited twice and will be back on Sunday, so 3 times just this week.  I want to take all of my friends and family here. I also went to Vegeway twice (Love). Chef Kenny is AMAZING and has brought so much joy to my life, his restaurants make my life change easier to dine out and socialize. I am a huge foodie and go out to restaurants, I want to stick with the Vegan lifestyle and I am thrilled to have found this place.  Tried the: Sesame Chicken ***** Spicy Crispy Beef ***** Cajun Fried Fish *** Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream ***** Green Tea Ice Cream *** Vegan Thai Tea ***** House Vegetable Soup *****  I keep re-ordering the Sesame Chicken it even taste good the next day re-heated. The Spicy Beef is excellent, but you have to eat it fresh, re-heated the next day is chewy.  I always order the Thai tea. I was surprised that I liked the cherry ice cream more than the green tea because I am a huge green tea fan, but I found the green tea ice cream too mild.  I will continue to try the other items on the menu and recommend Chef Kennys restaurant  to everyone. I am even thinking of getting him a thank-you card and a small gift.",

I've gotten lunch to-go from here probably 4 times but that was the first time I tried it thru a coworker. Finally went to go dine in for the first time yesterday and was a very happy customer. I also had a groupon for a $20 credit for this place so it was a win win! My boyfriend ordered the crispy beef and got the peanuts and sauce on the side, he was worried the sauce was going to be too spicy to his liking so he wanted to dip the beef in the sauce instead. I REALLY love the crispy eggplant and had ordered that the last 2 times so of course I got it, AGAIN (lol). I'm seriously always \"mind fucked\" when I here because you THINK you're eating meat, and it LOOKS exactly like meat...but it's NOT! Even the orange chicken that I saw a lot of people ordering looked exactly like it even though it's tofu or plant based. I will be coming back  here, and will be trying to get this on my lunches more often!",

I am all for fake meat (because I can only eat so much tofu). Veggie House is among a cluster of Asian restaurants in Chinatown on the second floor.      I walked in and heard what I thought was a bird chipping. Wait, isn't that a health code violation? Just kidding, it's just for sound effects! It was a Saturday night, but we were immediately seated. The waitress took the time to explain that the Veggie House menu is 100% vegan (unless you specifically request that you want eggs or something in your fried rice).   I went with the Sesame chicken ($10.95) and my husband ordered Curry Chicken ($10.95). Less than 5 minutes later, our food was coming to the table! I think Veggie House broke the record for quickest cooking times.   CURRY CHICKEN: The curry chicken came out in a Pyrex looking pie platter. Kind of weird. The curry chicken came with potatoes, cauliflower, and LOADS of bell pepper strips. The best parts were the potatoes and cauliflower. The \"chicken\" was too soggy/stringy for me.    SESAME CHICKEN: I wish it was spicier. The hot chile pepper indicating heat on the menu is a farce! At least for the sesame chicken. Other than that gripe, I really liked my entree. The chicken was super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It tasted like it was deep fried and reminded me of a dessert, but in a good way. On a side note, the sesame chicken made for decent leftovers! Oh yeah.  ATMOSPHERE: It seemed kind of dated in here. Could use a little pick me up.  After a Groupon, the total came to $10.97 (deal was $11 for $20). Not bad!  Return visit? Is a tin man's dick made of sheet metal? Yes!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #18",

We order the wontons, miso soup, honey walnut shrimp, crispy spicy beef, beef house chow mein, orange chicken and the cherry chip ice cream afterwards. We loved EVERYTHING. Even our non vegan friends thought everything was delicious and were very impressed. The service was excellent. Food came out fast.

I have gone several times for take out and usually order the Kung Pao chicken, it's very good and the \"meat\" is very tender and convincing. One time I ordered the pineapple duck and I would give that 4 stars, it was ok but not as good as the Kung Pao chicken. I also recommend choosing their brown rice which is more of like a wild rice mix in my opinion but very good.  It's hard to find, the directions Yelp and Google gave me we're wrong, it's in the two story center off spring mountain and Decatur on the 2nd story. However every time I've gone in it was very busy for a hole in the wall location which is a sign of good food usually. Give them a chance, I think meat eaters would be fooled!",

Everything that we've tried has been really, really enjoyable but the ones I mentioned here are the ones that I would order first everytime I go, and then I add a couple of new dishes I haven't had before as well.  Their cherry chocolate chip \"ice cream\" is the perfect way to end a meal that leaves you full and in disbelief that everything you just ate was completely vegan.

Our waitress was very prompt and was very attentive, which they usually always are. If you are Vegan or Vegetarian this is a notorious place you must eat at in Las Vegas, you won't be let down!",

I can't say that with all the choices of food I will be back to Veggie House anytime soon.    Although the staff was nice, our food was bland and lacked any amount of spice.  The lunch soup tasted like water and even the vegetables in the soup lacked any sort of flavor....and to add the icing to the cake I had the review of the GMO soy products flashing through my memory.  Soy is one of the largest GMO crops outside of corn and I couldn't get past it with every bite.  Our food wasn't horrible, it was edible...I left full...it was clean...and everyone was nice.",

It does taste like beef, but has this very interesting texture...hmmm, like really good pork carnitas...crispy on the edges and tender in the middle. We've tried a lot of dishes there in addition, and have enjoyed them all: the sizzling vegetable plates, the orange \"beef\", and different \"shrimp\" dishes (but eat the \"shrimp\" while its hot and fresh; the texture doesn't fare well from being taken home and put into the refrigerator). And you must try to the roti canai (next to frybread, the best thing ever done with wheat flour!), with vegan curry sauce to dip it in. Ohmigosh, I think we need to make a trip there tonight!  I also like that this is another \"corporate chef\" who decided to strike out on his own and enrich our city's dining diversity. It is run by a very small staff, so be patient. And be clear...if the waitress doesn't seem to understand you, point to it on the menu. And try to figure out where the bird chirps are coming from, while you wait for your meal :-)",

After walking in and just standing there waiting for them to acknowledge us, I was starting to question this establishment and their service.  They weren't that busy at the moment either.  However, we stuck around and waited to be seated, and boy am I glad we did.  The food was amazing to say the least, and the service turned out to be superb.  I was not disappointed at all by the food or the service.  After perusing the menu, we were a bit overwhelmed by all the choices they offered.  We ended up ordering Kung Pao \"Chicken\" and Hong Shao Tofu.  The \"chicken\" literally tastes like chicken and it was delicious!  We weren't even done and we couldn't wait to go back a second time for more.  We've now been there three times in 9 days.  This is definitely a restaurant to try!",

This has become a new go to spot for me, I have a few friends in LA who are vegan and introduced me to this kind of Tofu meal years ago that looks, feels and tastes like meat.  You do not need meat to survive you do however need protein.  One of the things you miss while either transitioning into a healthier way of living or after living it for awhile is a meat texture instead of a pile of tofu or beans.  Sadly I don't make it to LA often enough to buy it and no stores here sell this kind of food!  This place is the Bomb!    The beef resembles what beef would look and feel like the shrimp is made to look like a shrimp down to the patterns on the little fake shrimps!  The have a huge selection of menu items and the portions are huge, I recommend doing it family style and sharing with friends.  The feel is very Om like the sound from the indoor waterfall is soothing and the staff is nice!",

Makes me wish they were closer to me than they are, because I don't live in Vegas, nor have plans to move there any time soon.     We had:    seaweed salad- portions were double what you would get anywhere else (and I know, because I order seaweed salad any time its on a restaurant menu) and it is entirely seaweed, instead of a little pile of seaweed with some other veggies underneath to make it look like there's more seaweed there (ahem, other restaurants)  roti w/ curry sauce-  the bread was perfect in texture and taste, airy and not greasy, and the curry sauce was out of this world  Oyster mushrooms w/ lemon sauce-  Very delicious.  Just superb.  This was one of the specials, and the mushrooms are deep fried and the basil (cooked) complements them and the sauce perfectly  Orange Beef-  OH. MY. GOD.  I want to eat this every day of my life.  The \"beef\" had a very nice crisped texture, excellent flavor and perfect amount of tang and spiciness to the sauce  Crispy Spicy Eggplant- This was pretty good, but not mindblowing.  If you really like eggplant you might feel differently, but compared to the other items we ordered...  The ambiance is great as well, the decor is cute and the servers are really friendly and attentive.    As others have related, the menu is extensive and has an impressive array of meat alternatives.    The only thing that I wish would change is the packaging for left overs- it was all styrofoam.  Would have been awesome if it were something more enviromentally friendly but I will just have to remember to bring my own containers and bag next time....",

There's a fountain of running water and sometimes, the \"birds\" chirp! It's very calming!!  SERVICE: 5 - Service was extremely good. It's a small space and just right for the servers to be attentive and helpful at all times. It's a very open area, so if you need a server, they can spot you from across the room! Our server was funny, nice, and very helpful!! Her name was Mimi, and she's a gem!   FOOD: 5 - All of the food, desserts included, were vegan. I was skeptical of this place at first, but now, I believe in vegans!! =P kidding, but the food was bomb!! It was just delicious. Everything that was ordered was hot and tasted almost like it's meat-counterpart. I was very impressed.   I am not vegan, but I love vegan food, vegetables, soy, etc. It was just delicious. I liked it better than regular Chinese food, it was that good! I do have to say that when I took the food home and ate it, it was not as good. So don't order what you cannot finish!  Local Specific Info: Check for a Groupon, it helps out a lot!! This place is a little on the expensive side if you want to order a lot! The Spicy Crispy Beef is bomb! and desserts are yummy~!! If you don't finish, you can take home your food!",

    "text": "All I can say is...what a lovely place. I recently converted to being meat less, and my friend decided to recommend me to this , \"VEGGIE House\". Man oh man, the interior is already so nice. We were seated right away and asked if we would like some hot tea and water. We were helped out by a very well informed and nice waitress, recommended us some dishes. Their food is all meat, garlic, onion; and dairy-free! Lunch special includes soup and white/brown rice! So don't miss it (11:30AM-3:00PM). We ordered general tzao chicken and crispy spicy eggplant, and the food was delivered quickly!   The food is really good, I swear the meatless meat is even better than actual meat. The texture is so soft...and as for the crispy eggplant, it was amazingly flavorful! I would recommend going here, even if you aren't vegetarian. I'm gonna come back next time with all my vegan friends !",

    "text": "This place is such a great find! We were invited here for dinner last night by some friends. We were warned that this place has pure vegetarian menu. I love trying new food so I was all for it. I came in there with an open mind.  And to be honest, this place blew me away!  Lemon Chicken / Kung Pao Chicken- I could not even tell the difference. The meat felt and tasted just like chicken to me.    House Fried Rice - This one is really one of the best things on their menu. It has ham, chicken and shrimp. He really got the texture and the flavors of the meats down. The way he made the shrimp, it looked and tasted like real shrimp. I have to constantly remind myself that all of these are made with vegetables. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me!  Crispy Eggplant - By far, this one is my favorite! It was cooked in vegetarian oyster sauce. The flavor was so good! I love how it was cooked crispy on the outside and yet soft in the middle. This dish made me change my opinion of eggplants.   Salt and Pepper Veggie Rib Strips - Like everything else that we tried, this one really felt like real meat in my mouth. It was a little tough but I guess most salt and pepper dishes are made that way. Or at least the ones I've had were always cooked a little dry. It's not really a savory dish but it was still a pretty good choice.   I love how Chef Kenny was able to do all these things. I give this place five star for innovation. Even if you are disappointed with some things, the flavors are still spot on. I know that most vegan dishes are made out of tofu. And you know tofu given its texture, you cannot really do much with it. The way Chef Kenny made it possible for vegans to still be able to enjoy the taste of meat is such an amazing work of art. Science and art and some kind of magic! I am totally amazed.",

    "text": "So good!! This is a totally vegetarian restaurant, so there is absolutely no meat in any of the dishes. The menu says \"roast pork\" or \"chicken stir fry\" but it's absolutely 100% meatless even though some of the dishes tastes like real meat.  I think the chef is caught in between wanting to cater to authentic Chinese tastes, & those who are used to less authentic tastes. So four stars bc while a few of the dishes were sooo awesome, a few were overly sweet like it was for a different audience. However, they are a clean restaurant. The oil they use to fry foods is changed frequently and doesn't have that old/stale taste some places have.   The service was great, very friendly and helpful. Place was clean and quiet when my party of four went (Monday night around 6pm). I'm definitely coming back!!   This is what we got:  Cantonese fish: made from tofu with crispy seaweed on top that took on the role of the fish's skin. It looked more like grilled fish than it tasted, but I love tofu so I enjoyed this a lot.   crispy beef: tofu based too, but this is the one dish that if I didn't know was vegetarian, I would've thought was a delicious beef dish. It was tasty. Perfectly crispy though a little too sweet.   Chicken hot plate: I loved this one. It was also tofu based and delicious. You can tell it was imitation meat, but this dish wasn't overly sweet. Great smoky flavor to the fake chicken with lots of fresh crisp veggies. I love how Chinese cooking has vegetable dishes where the veggies are both crisp and saucy. My fave :)   Scallop pan fried crispy noodle: too sweet, but the noodles were crispy and good. The scallops were a form of big mushroom (the literal Chinese to English translation of the mushrooms are chicken leg mushrooms) that was breaded and fried. This was okay, I wouldn't order it again.   Fried eggplant: sweet eggplant sliced like French fries. Had a sticky and crispy texture which was interesting. Like caramel stickiness to it. I thought it was too sweet again but interesting. In all my 31 years of eating Chinese food I have literally never eaten a dish like this before. Wouldn't order it again but didn't regret it.   Overall: yum!! I'm coming back for sure :)",

It's a healthier option to eating animal products without a feeling of missing. I would give veggie house multiple tries just to be able to get through more of their vast menu.",

The crispy \"beef\" was very crispy and had a good flavor, but it didn't taste like meat to me, which is a plus. However, the roti with curry sauce was the highlight of our meal and tasted delicious.   We had a groupon, which we weren't allowed to use with the lunch special and we had forgotten the details of the groupon because we have so many. The waitress was able to accommodate us by switching  everything from lunch special to full prices. If we had known this, we might have ordered other things. We realize that not knowing the terms of our groupon was our fault, but it would have been nice for the waitress to check if we were using one when she took our order. Hopefully they will do this for future patrons.",

My favorite dish was the orange \"chicken\" and the soft tofu. Everything we ordered tasted good, although my least favorite was the curry dish which was a bit lacking in flavor compared to the explosion of flavors in the other dishes we ordered. The crispy spicy eggplant was very good too.   My family was very happy with this meal, especially my father who has been lactose intolerant his whole life. He got to try \"cheesecake\"  for the first time in his life at age 60. He loved it so much,  and we also ordered the vegan green tea ice cream with sweet sticky rice at the bottom for dessert which he liked as well.

    "text": "Me and my bestfriend were hungry, around 8:30pm. We didn't want anything too heavy but we were pretty hungry! We stopped by and has never had veggie food. We're carnivores. We ordered the peppered steak and orange chicken. We were very blown away. When people say you can't even tell the difference, you can't. In a good way. The food was well flavored. Crispy and chewy like \"meat\" should be. They give you brown or white rice. Overall for being a late night meal and probably their last customers of the day, they treated us well and didn't rush us at all. They cooked our food great and we were happy! We will be back!",

    "text": "Read a blog before visiting Las Vegas about vegan food options.  So we decided to try Veggie House.  My husband ordered the Kung Pao chicken and I ordered spring rolls and Lemon Chicken.  The kung Pao chicken was one of the best vegan version my husband had ever tasted.  I agreed with him.  Now the bad stuff.  The spring rolls were small and cut into two to make it look like four pieces but they were small and not as flavorful as others I have had.  They served them with sweet and sour but no spicy mustard sauce :(  My presentation of my Lemon Chicken had my mouth salivating.  Unfortunately that is where my dining experience went further down hill.  The chicken lacked flavor and was rubbery.  I thought about sending it back and ordering something else.  I can not explain why I didn't.  Not sure if I want a repeat visit in the future.",

    "text": "Amazing Vegan food! Everything on the menu is vegetarian and most things are vegan. The food has never let me down and my husband and i get new things every time we go. The service is fast and kind. It's far for us here in Henderson, but absolutely worth it. The menu has many vegetable based options, but also has many \"fake meat\" options. This is a nice change when you are used to having the same textures all the time. I recommend the crispy beef and the sushi! Absolutely worth is for a vegan experience in China Town, Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Service was great! Our server was super friendly and recommended some items that she liked.   For appetizers we ordered Spring rolls and the Roti dish. The spring rolls were tiny but perfect!!! Comes with a sweet and sour sauce. They are crispy and tasty. The Roti was my favorite! I could have eaten 4 orders! The sauce is a coconut curry-ish flavor and the bread comes out warm...mmmm so good!!  We also ordered the braised tofu and veggies, ok....exactly what you would expect. We also had the generals chicken and chow fun noodles both were really good. You wouldn't even know it wasn't actual meat. 36$ for 3 of us (without tip).  Will be back to try more!!",

I don't live in Vegas, so since it was so good I went all it and got the cherry chocolate chip ice cream too. Also outstanding. Just go, you won't regret it! They have awards all over their walls for a reason.",

    "text": "A True hidden gem next to and upstairs from the SF supermarket. Since there are only a few vegetarian restaurants in Vegas, a good Asian one is a definite welcome addition. It gives you have options for dining out, especially if there is a vegetarian or Buddhist in your party  I was only able to try a few dishes since I was dining solo. I ordered the roti appetizer, pot stickers, and stir fired tofu with vegetable. In addition to traditional vegetarian dishes (stir fried vegies, tofu,etc.) There is a very large selection of faux meat dishes.   The roti appetizer was terrific, some of the best roti I have had in Vegas. Very flaky and not too greasy. The pot stickers were also very good, having minced tofu and leek, I think. You couldn't tell it was vegetarian since it tasted great. The last dish I ordered was a stir fried tofu dish with vegetables which was fine, nothing special. Brown rice is an option, but they do charge extra for it as well as charging for extra orders of white rice.  Service was friendly and attentive, nothing fantastic, but definitely nothing negative. And the food was prepared and served quickly. Definitely worth a return visit.  .",
