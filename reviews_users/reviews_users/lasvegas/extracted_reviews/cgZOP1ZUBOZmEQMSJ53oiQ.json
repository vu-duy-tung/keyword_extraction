Chef Marc takes a lot of care in his food prep and the place is small/intimate enough, he will come out to the table at some time usually before you order, to explain the specials, and later on to see how you liked it. The bartender usually comes around to and check on folks. Basically, all the staff is friendly. Definitely try the duck ragu and Roma Raviola with Alba white truffles while they're still available!",

Our waiter as well as the waitstaff and front desk person treated us were friendly and polite.  Shrimp Fra Deovalo was excellent as was the desert selection of homemade ricotta cheesecake and wonderful cannoli.

But here it is, a wonderful review for a restaurant that deserves it.  Food was excellent and many items are sourced organically.    The ambience is just right.  Cozy, simple but tasteful decor, and friendly, professional wait staff.  The bartender, Sam, was delightful and took good care of us.  We even got to meet Chef Marc himself and what a delight he is.  There's nothing like talking to someone who is passionate about what they do and this chef clearly loves life itself and creating wonderful food experiences for others.  .....some months later.... I am updating this review with last night's experience: My husband took me and our family here to celebrate my birthday last night.  I ordered the house steak and it was as good as any Japanese Kobe beef steak I've had here in Las Vegas or San Francisco. Exquisite food, professional, delightful staff.   The best birthday dinner ever.",

    "text": "Items Served: Pizza Focaccia and Warm Semolina Bread Uni Crostini, Figs, Blueberries, Blackberries, Wasabi Leaves Fava Bean Leaves, Aged Parmigianino, Grapes Buratta Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes, Aged Balsamic Pork Belly & Bone Marrow with Polenta, Pickled Fennel Bulb and Parsley Salad Eggplant Parm, Tempura Basil and Sage Spinach Agnolotti in Butter Sage Sauce Sesame Seed Crusted Line Caught Halibut with Handmade Squid Ink Spaghetti, Romano Beans, Scallop Bisque Lemon Sorbetto Braised Veal Short Rib with Polenta and Peppered Rapini Malfiata Rum Cake and Tiramisu  Born Marcus Sgrizzi, but known locally as Chef Marc, it was before officially relocating to Las Vegas that a visit to Parma acquainted me with the Chef's well-deserved acclaim, and subsequently meeting some now-close friends by way of an event held at Novecento it seemed strange that Trattoria by Chef Marc had slipped beneath my radar nearly nine months since opening, the move finding Mr. Sgrizzi now in a more refined space only ten minutes from my gate.  East Coast raised, but well traveled throughout Italy with an 'effort equals results' sort of mentality that sees Marc and his team scratch-make everything from Bread and Pasta to Desserts and Sauces in-house, Trattoria by Chef Marc sits just outside The Lakes on West Sahara Avenue in a space formerly inhabited by Argana Moroccan Restaurant, the interior featuring heavy woods and marble plus a hand-built Wine Vault with sound a bit louder than would be ideal due to the combination of hard surfaces and overhead music, though a near-full-house of locals still did not make things so noisy that one would be forced to shout.  Offering an a la carte menu plus a $65 \"Chef's Table\" that sees diners preferences incorporated into a tasting otherwise left in the kitchen's hands, it was by request that Marc and his team crafted an 'extended' version of the latter experience that eventually turned into eleven courses including several menu favorites, the quality of many comparing favorably to Casino-based restaurants charging more than twice the price.  Well established in the city, and as such forming relationships with high quality purveyors of Italian goods plus vegetables brought in from Melissa's Produce of California, a meal at Trattoria begins with Sgrizzi's bread basket and although little packets of cold butter seem a bit out of place in an environment where Olive Oil should come standard the Bread itself is as delicious as it is dangerous, both the Pizza Focaccia and warm Semolina loaf difficult to resist, particularly as a means for sopping up sauces.  No doubt looking to build on past successes and further strengthen a menu filled with the time-tested recipes on which he built his name, first courses of the Chef's Table saw Chef Marc dabbling in fresh ingredients that he has recently become fond of, the Sea Urchin seemingly served as a means to work with seasonal Fruits and Wasabi leaf while the inspired Salad that followed tasted very much like Fava Beans despite the fact that only Greens, Grapes, Cheese and Seasoning were mingling on the plate.  Turning eyes to the laminated menu for a moment, the Buratta Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes and aged Balsamic expected but delicious in its simplicity just the same, course four saw Chef Marc take on the hefty pairing of Pork Belly and Bone Marrow with a keen sense of delicacy, the supple pig stacked atop buttered toast while the hemisected Cannon saw its creamy contents delicious whether mixed into Polenta or enjoyed with Picked Fennel Bulb and traditional Parsley Salad.  Personally requesting the Eggplant Parm, a small wedge offered alongside house Marinara and lightly fried herbs, a nightly special Pasta next saw soft Meat and Ricotta spring to life in a butter sauce tinged in Nutmeg and Sage, the line-caught Halibut to follow both meaty and flaky beneath a skin of crisp Sesame Seeds with rich Scallop Bisque lent levity by Pasta and snappy Italian Beans.  Refreshing the palate with Lemon Sorbetto, the icy texture needing a bit of work, another special of Braised Veal Short Rib ate much like Osso Bucco with both the White Wine of the braising liquid and spicy Greens serving as balance, a small portion of the deconstructed Lasagna using a similar cut of Meat every bit as excellent when baked with Mozzarella.  Rounding out the evening with half-portions of Butter Rum Cake and Tiramisu, both made by Marc's Wife, desserts were well made if not a little predictable, the only other option offered a Creme Brulee that seems more \"Summerlin\" than Italian in a place where something like Canolli, Budino or even an Italian Cookie Plate would better round out the night.  ****Without doubt the most creative Italian spot on the West side of the Valley, and in the conversation for most labor intensive kitchen off-strip, Trattoria shows Chef Marc back in his element creating great food and welcoming guests to his kitchen, a work in progress that is already pretty great",

    "text": "This has been on our must-try list for more than a year based on the Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately it did not measure up to our expectations.  This is definitely more of a neighborhood Italian restaurant but it tries to be a bit more elevated with it's dishes and pricing.  I don't believe it achieves it.  The restaurant itself is fairly small holding a capacity of under 100 diners.  The atmosphere is more of a casual neighborhood restaurant.  There are full-height windows throughout the dining area.  However these were all covered with solid rolling blinds when we arrived, we assumed, due to the summer sun. However after sundown they were never rolled up leaving the dining area to feel like a small dark space.  The service was good, not over-the-top impressive but also not neglectful.  One of the oddest experiences however was that the chef, presumably Marc, had made his presence in the quaint dining room twice during the course of our meal stopping at every table each time except ours.   Two of us ordered the 7-course tasting menu.  Overall all items were good however a bit heavy on the seafood items.  I will blame myself for not speaking up when the waitress asked if there was anything that we would not eat.  While there wasn't my son, who was the other tasting menu order, will eat about anything but would have preferred less seafood selections.  We had ordered a charcuterie plate for the table for an appetizer.  We were underwhelmed by the selections, quantity and presentation.  It was a platter of: 4-rolled slices of each mortadella and soppresata, 6-small pieces of aged provolone, 10-olives, and 1-quarter of roasted artichoke.  My daughter ordered the Chicken Riggies which was rigatoni noodles with chicken, pancetta, jalapeno peppers in a red sauce.  There is a similar dish served at Salute ad Red Rock Casino that she likes so this dish piqued her interest.  She again was underwhelmed with this dish.    My wife ordered a bowl of the Pasta e Fagioli soup.  This was very good according to my her.  She also sampled along with my son and my tasting meals and she too liked most of the courses.    There are some pros.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, some of the food was very good, and it is conveniently located off of the Strip.  The cons were that there was too much inconsistencies and they try too hard to be an elevated Italian restaurant in a city full of great options.",

    "text": "A wonderful experience. Chef Marc is very personable and enthusiastic which is reflected in his food. Besides cooking he takes the time to listen to his customers. His food is excellent with layers of flavors. My husband described to him the sauce his Italian grandmother made for her gnocchi. He recreated a similar dish with a fusion of his oxtail dish & gnocchi dish. It was outstanding. The pasta fagioli was rich in flavor and the eggplant parm was light & tasty.",

    "text": "Chef Marc newest venture is the best yet.  Since he opened a few weeks ago I have eaten there twice and went away talking about how amazing it was both times.  Being Italian and a foodie my standards are high and he exceeded my expectations.  His menu gives options for old classics and new True Italian fare with his own personal twist.  The two different dining partners that joined me raved about the food & experience more than I did.  Everything is home made in house including the amazing bread.  The gnocchi with Osso Bucco gravy was so outstanding I ordered it on both visits and shared it for an appetizer.  His passion for what he does and his desire to create the finest possible dining experience shine thru in this restaurant without a doubt.  The pricing is some of the best in the city for this quality food & experienced wait staff, Marco & Lino do an outstanding job.   The interior has a fresh remodel and an inviting patio when weather permits.  Returning with more foodie friends this weekend.  Closed Monday & Tuesday but available for private parties which we are planning to take advantage of soon.   Congratulation's Chef Marc!",

    "text": "We were fans of Parma and went to the Trattoria for the first time on the Saturday night before Mother's Day. While we were seated promptly (we had reservations), our server was very slow in everything from menus, to drink service, to food service, to the bill. The bread basket was good. We got the mozzarella en carroza for an appetizer and while it was fine, it was basically just a fried grilled cheese sandwich. It didn't have any seasoning or flavor beyond that. There was marianara sauce to dip it in at least. My husband got one of the daily specials, a spicy salmon dish served with mashed cauliflower and it was good, but when we got the bill he was surprised at the price....it wasn't that good! As for my pappardelle with roasted cauliflower, it was just bland. The pasta itself was quite good but the sauce was boring and the roasted cauliflower didn't add anything. Everything was edible, but after eating such delicious food at Parma in it's wonderfully funky atmostphere, we were sorely disappointed by the lackluster food, inadequate service, and fairly standard (though nice) atmosphere. I'm sorry to write this, but it just didn't live up to our expectations!",

They're loyal supporters.  Must say in addition to the outstanding Italian food I enjoyed the casual atmosphere.  This is the best of both worlds.  Be comfortable and enjoy some of the best food ever.  Fantastic pasta and the best chicken piccata.  I've eaten chicken piccata in many restaurants.  This was the most tender and flavorful of any.  That's saying something given the number of Italian restaurants calling Vegas home.  Chef Marc came out to see how we were doing. Very cordial.  They'll make anything on menu to your specification.  Really fresh ingredients.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and happy to accommodate any special requests.  Sometimes it's hard to find good appetizers, salad, bread and entrees.  Usually you'll find one thing you really like and the rest is so-so.  Not here.  Rest assured you'll like everything you order.  Reasonable priced for the quality.  This is a few miles west of the strip on Sahara. Such a nice change from the overpriced, service-challenged eateries on the strip.",

The service however has been anything but outstanding! Lino (Leno) whichever, is the worst server we have ever encountered.  If he has a table of 6 or more and you get seated in his section, goodluck!! He takes care of his large party and you can only hope that another server will step in and offer to take care of you or you will be without service!! This has happened on every visit to the Trattoria, although this past Saturday when it happened we were pleasantly surprised when Kenny stepped in to take care of us and did a fantastic job, and he is a new employee!! He makes Lino look like an amateur, and his personality is much more pleasant than Lino!!  All future visits to the Trattoria will come with a HUGE request NOT to get Lino as our server!! He is definitely not an asset to this new location! Hopefully this will be addressed before it hurts the business!!",

We all were quite excited to try this place due to excellent reviews.  We were welcomed by the owner and were seated after they made a table for us ready. The chef explained a lot about the restaurant and where each ingredient came from. The food was Ok! The fusilli looking pasta ( my least favorite pasta) that came with the dishes as side and the red sauce lacked taste. I had eggplant Parmesan and It had no taste! I make better ones! My husband had  the cheek veal, it was tender and good. My son had chicken Marsala that came with the same tasteless pasta side. One friend had chicken Parmesan and the other had scallops that the waiter insisted is the best choice . When it came it was about 4 of them and didn't look that much for $42!!  The Caesar salad was good and tasty. Sevice was good and attentive. The $$ on the Yelp is misleading. For 5 of us it was $350 with no appetizer and only 4 glasses of red wine. I thought it was too expensive for what we got and the place.",

    "text": "This was our first time to this particular restaurant, but we've been fans of Chef Marc's other restaurants in the past years. The ambiance was beautiful, especially because it was decorated for Christmas. It was cozy and inviting. I also have to preface my review saying I had 2 handicapped people in my party as well as a baby and a 2 year old. The staff was amazing with every person in the party, especially the children. Which as a mom, you always worry about when taking your kids out. Chef Marc came to our table and greeted us. I asked him what he recommended since we had never been there before. He answered all our questions and came back about 5 minutes later to ask if we wanted food to come out quickly for the 2 year old. I thought this was amazing! I soooo appreciated him thinking about that. We ordered appetizers including the charcuterie board, meatballs, and the octopus. All were very good. I saw the octopus with the white beans on Yelp so I was expecting that. But ours came with a tomato and onion compote (at least I think that's what it was). It was very good but I definitely want to go back and try the one with the white beans. The meatballs were probably the best meatballs I've ever had in my life. And I've always thought MY meatballs were the best ever. For entrees we had the pork chop (AMAZING!), eggplant parm, rigatoni and meatballs, shrimp scampi, and chicken Marsala. The stand out was definitely the pork chop, mostly because of the sauce. I could just eat a jar of that sauce  don't get me wrong everything else was good too. For dessert we had gelato and rum cake. Both tasted soooo good and was a great way to close out dinner.  I know the menu changes often, which I appreciate. In the future I'd love to see cannolis for dessert and a few more choices for appetizers. Personally I rather eat appetizers tapas style than a whole meal.  I really appreciated how friendly our waitress was and how chef Marc checked on us and everyone else several times that night.  And for people who care, the bathrooms were EXTREMELY clean!",

The chicken is organic, juicy, tender and covered with delicious mozzarella cheese and a specially prepared tomato sauce. I was able to cut the chicken with my fork and the tomato sauce (gravy) was not raw (served directly out of a can). I usually order seafood at Marc's because it is one of the few restaurants in Las Vegas that serve FRESH, not frozen seafood.",

We were greeted by a very friendly older Italian gentleman at the host stand who sat us immediately.  I had made reservations for us and they're recommended because the place was quite busy on a Friday night.    There were several specials available for dinner with the butternut squash ravioli immediately catching my eye, especially the part about brown butter sage.  My friend went with the Frutti di Mare (Fruit of the Sea) with calamari, shrimp, mussels, and clams served with pasta.  The bread basket came with two types of bread, our favorite being the Italian with sesame seeds:  slather that butter on and devour!  I had a bowl of pasta e fagioli to start while my friend had a glass of wine as her appetizer.  The soup was hearty and great comfort food for the cold weather.  The delicious ravioli was gone in no time flat.  I got to try the gal pal's dish and it was also very good, especially if you love shellfish.  Chef Marc came by each table to check on his diners as he usually does.  A fan of his since we met him through Nelson Q.'s UYEs, Chef Marc is very personable and you can tell he cares about his food and his customers.  Come here for some Italian food made with love that your stomach will love, too.",

    "text": "Chef Marc's Trattoria is the best Las Vegas neighborhood Italian restaurant meal that I ever had. My second favorite is Chef Marc's Parma back in 2014. Chef Marc, who's real name is Marcus Sgrizzi has created remarkable Italian food dishes in Las Vegas since 2000. Surprisingly it was his love for boxing that led the local celebrity chef to Las Vegas. Chef Marcus Sgrizzi's talent started way before he opened his first restaurant in Las Vegas. He Italian food masterpieces goes back to Singer Island in South Florida where he worked in his family's Italian restaurant. After my first experience in Parma, I thank boxing for leading the talented Chef to Bright Light City.  More than I want to thank boxing for the greatest Las Vegas Italian restaurant experience I've had in Las Vegas, I want to thank my dear friend for leading me to it. She has led me to exceptional restaurants that included Yummy Sushi and Parma. When she invited me to join both herself and mother for a dinner in Chef Marc's Trattoria, I was honored.  I am also honored to provide a brief introduction to Chef Marc's Trattoria before seguing into my personal experience. The first thing that I want to say is that Chef Marc's is a relatively new restaurant that opened on November 14, 2015 in the former Argana Moroccan Restaurant in the quaint Lakeside Village Plaza. Secondly I want to touch on what a Trattoria is. According to Wikipedia, a Trattoria is an Italian restaurant that is less formal than a ristauranti and more formal than an osteria. Wikipedia goes on to say that in recent times that the menus are short, the emphasis has shifted to the food, and the emphasis is on local cuisine. According to Chef Marc in a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvegas.eater.com&s=9942da4b7684179b1eadb771c7324ccc0f1091f6aa6193ee30faea41bce500aa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegas.eater.com</a> article by Bradley Martin, \"This place has the most charm of any place I've owned yet. Like a visit to an old Tucson villa.\" Chef Marc was right on the money. I felt like I was spending a Friday evening in an Italian villa.  The first thing you notice before entering the restaurant is the dim lighting in the parking lot. Located in the Desert Shores community the parking lot features the same theme lamp posts that are throughout the community. This helps create a quaint environment. Under the dim lamp posts, I walked towards a mobile pizza oven. It mentions Novecento Neapolitan, which by the way is a solid pizza restaurant that I enjoyed a few years back off Eastern Avenue near the 215. Before headed to the outside menu, I checked out the mobile oven. In back of the mobile oven stood the 800 square foot outdoor patio.  In contrast to the abbreviated menus that trattorias customarily provide, this is a decent sized menu. Right off the bat I was ordering eggplant parmesan with fusillia pasta under a coating of fresh pasta marinara ($19).  After meeting up with my dear friend and her mother, the server led us to a comfortable table at the corner. It was the ideal spot to be in the moment appreciating the time with my company and remarkable Italian food. The noise level was low at the same time that we could hear and see the action at the bar. If my friend was not mistaken, we were sharing the room with Evander Hollyfield. We were also sharing the room with Chef Marc who personally walked up to our table to guarantee that we were having a nice experience in his restaurant.  Leading into the appetizers, our waitress presented us with a basket of fresh baked bread. My dear friend who is an authority on food presented me with samples of both her's and her mother's appetizers. The Burrata & heirloom with the pizza bread provided me with further confidence that she is an expert on Italian food. I would like to think that I am an authority on eggplant parmesan. It's only been one of my favorite foods since 1983. Whether or not I'm an expert on eggplant parmesan, my taste buds rated Chef Marc's creation highly. This leads into an important review pointer that Chef Marc's gives a substantial portion of food in proportion to a great number of celebrity chefs. And great foods. When it came to drinks, I opted out of the vast selection of wine, choosing a Coke instead. The Coke came in a can that the waitress poured into a glass with ice.  It pays to have dear friends that lead you to exceptional dining experiences like Chef Marc's Trattoria. I in turn want to lead you my dear Yelp friends and unique Yelp visitors to an exceptional Italian food experience in Chef Marc's Trattoria.",

I loved everything about our experience...the food, the ambiance, the service.   The food was spectacular. You can taste the care put into every dish that is served. Excellent flavors, good quality proteins, fresh homemade pasta. The bread is made fresh daily and it tastes as such.   Our server, Donny, was very attentive and gracious to go over his recommendations in detail with great descriptions of how each item was prepared.   We found it especially impressive that Chef Marc is going around to each and every table to greet customers and welcome everyone with genuine hospitality. What a dedicated owner!   We really had a tough time choosing what to order because it all sounded delicious. But even better, every item we ordered was fantastic!   We will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Chef Marc is about a 30-minute drive off the Strip, but just make the drive, you won't regret it. That's if they're open, which they're NOT on Mondays and Tuesdays, so don't go on Monday or Tuesday. Sunday evening they were not terribly busy, but the wife and I also had a reservation so we were seated immediately on arriving, our waiter introduced himself, told us the specials, then gave us a few moments to look over the menu.   A couple of minutes later a very friendly, older gentleman came out and started talking to us, and he also asked us if we had any questions, etc., then he offered to take our drink orders. After he left my wife told me that it was Chef Marc himself. Now my Yelp reviews may not show it but I've eaten in some pretty upscale joints but I've never had the chef come to my table to chat and talk food before the meal. I was already impressed and I hadn't even eaten anything.  Chef Marc came back with our drinks then talked food with us some more. The wife chose the Frutti di Mare and it was LOADED with shellfish. She loves her seafood, and she can be picky, but she was very happy with her dish. Chef sold me on the Chicken Riggies over the Short Rib Malfatti, and I'm glad he did because it was delicious! I'm sure the Malfatti would have been excellent, too, but I didn't regret getting the Riggies. My one regret was we were only in town for a few days and, as I've mentioned already, he closes Monday and Tuesday so we were not able to return for a second meal.   The Malfatti will have to wait until next time because we will be back. Oh yes, we will.",

Really really good and the atmosphere was pure flavor and pride.  If you are a foodie, put this on your list.  We can't wait to go back.",

We had reservations at 6pm but for a Thursday night probably didn't need it.   Service:  5/5 friendly and professional.  They made us feel like we were the most important table in the place.  Chef Marc came to our table several times and we really appreciate it.  We love hearing the stories behind the dishes. Never had to ask for a water or wine refill. They were on the service without being over bearing. I do apologize I completely forgot our servers name but he was a delight. Great Italian accent!  Food: 5/5 they do offer a chefs tasting menu for $65 however my heart was set on other items but we will be back to for that.  Octopus 5/5: moist and perfect Burrata 5/5: creamy and worth the calories Veal 5/5: flavor flavor flavor Malfiata 5/5: omg!!!! Bread 5/5: fresh and soft center. Soft butter love it!  Tip: corking fee $25 good deal!  Overall definitely recommend this place. We will be back for sure!  Thanks for a memorable anniversary dinner.",

It was Friday night so we called ahead to for availability. The first impression from the hostess was A+. We showed up, table was ready, the experience began. The place was busy...really busy! Our waitress was a lady by the name of Giovanna who felt like a family member inviting you into her kitchen. She was on-it and very welcoming. We ordered a couple apps and entrees...We kept saying that \"THIS ONE IF OUR FAVORITE\" as each dish came out. The pasta Is made in-house and you easily taste the difference! The Owner, Marc, was working the floor. It happened to be his birthday so we could hear the staff singing to him in the back. Italian or not, This might be our new favorite Italian spot. This is a secret gem in Summerlin! Marc, Giovanna, and staff...BRAVO!",

    "text": "Very disappointed! We had reservations last night for my birthday. We were seated immediately, however, they sat us in a booth next to a party of 8, when there were several other open tables for a party of two. We ordered our drinks and food and when our main entree came, they placed it and immediately left. I received an Eggplant parmesan, when I ordered Chicken Piccata (white wine/lemon sauce).  While waiting for anyone to come back to the table, they realized they sent me the wrong dish. The Chef came by and said \"would you like this or what you order?\" Are you serious?!? I'll take what I ordered. While waiting, I leave and go to the restroom, my corrected dish comes. I look around for the pasta that would come with it and it's nowhere to be found. I wait for them to come back around to no avail, so my husband flags down our waitress. I ask if this dish comes with pasta or if it's literally just the chicken. She points to the pasta they left on the table from the Eggplant Parmesan, and says that's it. Ok so you're telling me a marinara sauce pasta goes with a white wine lemon dish? I don't think so... I asked for a side of pasta that is in a white wine sauce that would match my main entree. She says do you want a butter garlic pasta? I said sure anything that will slightly complement my main dish. They bring out the pasta, and it's not cooked all the way. At this point I'm extremely annoyed with the comment of do I want to keep a dish I didn't order or get my proper dish and the wrong pasta with my corrected dish. Since it's my birthday they bring out a strawberry cake set it down and leave immediately. The table of 8 next to us, Says oh it's your birthday happy birthday and actually acknowledges it not the restaurant I'm celebrating it with. Totally disappointed with the service and the nerve of the restaurant to charge me for the pasta in the butter garlic sauce that would match my dish that they got wrong in the first place.  I give the restaurant 2 stars because the strawberry cake was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten.   I was a frequent at the previous restaurant in its spot and new the staff by name, and they know us by name. I was hoping for the same with Chef Mark however that is not the case and I will not be going back",

We were overwhelmed by the taste, presentation and ingenious culinarily flair. The Chef's tasting menu is  21st Century modern Italian cooking, you'd expect to eat in an upscale Italian restaurant in Italy. You will not be disappointed!.  Our tasting started with buratta and roasted beets, the freshness of the buratta made it melt in your mouth. The Chef gave us a sampling of sea urchin \"uni\", that was again delicious, if I attempt to describe it I not do it justice, take my word for it is was amazing. After which we had polenta wit house cured pancetta and seared bacon, where do I begin?.  Polenta spot on in texture and taste, pancetta was one of the best I've eaten, my husband would eaten a dish of the bacon! It was that good. Followed by a spicy seafood black squid spaghetti with artichokes, perfection!.  We then were served homemade truffle ravioli in a light sage sauce, the last time I had truffle ravioli was at il Mulino in NYC, it was that good.  Our main course was grouper fish over polenta with a NY strip steak accompanied by zucchini. The fish was smooth like butter and the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare.  My picture does not do the main dish justice, it was delicious. Followed by tiramisu and rum cake. Both deserts were amazing and done right!.  They were not too sweet or too soggy, some restaurants over do the rum or sugar to compensate for the lack of taste and fresh ingredients but not here. All the bread and pasta is made daily fresh and you can taste the difference. The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable. Chef Marc visited the table a few times to check in with us and gage our experience.  We had no dietary restrictions or requests - we wanted a culinary experience and we got one.  We were not disappointed and will go back again.  Yes, Chef Marc does cook classic Italian as well.  Buon Appetito",

If steak is on the menu it is a must have.  We often get it and split it for the table along with our pastas.  There is a chicken and shrimp dish that at first glance wouldn't seem to work but it is amazing.  Portion size is plentiful.  Chef Marc's flavors are spot on.  Service is top notch and the extra bonus is Chef Marc coming out and saying hello to all the tables.  Wines are reasonably priced and pironi beer on tap.  Reservations are recommended but we often sit at the small bar area.  We are thrilled Chef Marc's is nearby and truly believe it is a restaurant worth traveling to from anywhere in las vegas.",

We picked our own seats and opted for a high top table towards the back of the room, nice music in the background and great service.   We started with the roasted beer salad, it was an average beer salad big chunks of beets, perfect sharing size. We ordered the chicken piccata which came out thin and perfectly cooked. I loved that it was all chicken and didn't come out on top of pasta. Our FAVORITE of the night was the Malfiata \"Deconstructed Lasagna\" with short ribs. Not overly rich, but completely decadent. It's a must order. At the end of our meal we ordered the rum cake, which was a perfect end to a good meal. The Chef came out and greeted us which I love. We will be back!",

The staff was amazing very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  Terrific atmosphere.  I had such a delightful time  that I went again a few nights later and had the Chicken Riggies and this dish was even better than the  ravioli. I cannot recommend this place highly enough,  it is a must try.",

I've gone to many Italian restaurants and I don't mind paying for food that's worth it. Unfortunately I must say these prices don't match. This is way over priced for food that was never better than mediocre. My wife had the eggplant Parmesan and it tasted bland and was thick with egg batter. I had the linguine with clams with the red sauce. The clams tasted fresh but it was lacking in flavor. The red sauce was very bland at best. They are less than or equal to an Olive Garden in terms of quality of dishes but are charging prices like Piero's.",

I was in Las Vegas on business and went there with three other friends. We decided on the Chef's choices of the day and we're glad we did! We had five courses that included everything from crab, to shrimp to beef, the linguine negro and dessert. Having a sweet tooth pretty much made dessert my favorite part of the meal. There were small cannoli's for each of us, rum cake that had a little hint on anisette (which I love) and cheesecake made from ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese. I ate more dessert than the other guys! It was a thoroughly enjoyable meal and I cannot wait to get back to LV and go to Marc's restaurant for dinner!!",

Chef Marc came to the table and explained how he made the seasonal dishes and answered any questions we had. The bread beforehand was amazing and the food blew us away. 11/10 would recommend. Stop reading this, get in your car right now, and go.",

The food was heaven sent and the service enhanced the dining experience. I'm not a seafood lover but the linguine my husband had was exquisite! The ravioli I had was a cheezy dream! The wine perfectly augmented our meals. For desert... of course their home made tiramisu and cappuccino.  Thank you so much Sam for your gracious service and to Marc the owner/chef your food is perfection! You absolutely made our date night! Dawn and Dean",

This place will not disappoint. The best Italian food I have ever had! The portion size is just perfect! The staff is so warm and friendly. I didn't make a reservation but they still seated me right away. The chef/owner came out and greeted me. He even made something for me that wasn't on the menu and even customized it (a lot if Italian places make dishes with pork or use pork additives) he made a dish for me without the pork. I already talked told my co-workers about this place and the next time I come out to Vegas ( I was only out here for business) I will bring my fiance out here.",

I think it is a little pricey at $9, but I enjoyed it--it tasted fresh.  Bonus points for good customer service: the two people (bartender, server) with whom I interacted were attentive and professional. That's something to expect at a restaurant with this price point, but it is nice to see a restaurant deliver good quality service and good quality food.",

We started off with a couple orders of escargot and risotto, both were well prepared and delicious.  The small squares of toast with the escargot made the dish pop.  Three of us then had the 7 course tasting menu, which was great.  The chef came out several times to tell us about a course, and describe its preparation.  By the end of the menu, we were very full.  My wife had the rib eye steak, which was very large and cooked to perfection.  The service started out as outstanding, with ice teas and water glasses refilled constantly.  As the restaurant began to get busy, the frequency of the servers' visits faltered a bit.  That would be my only critique, and it is not a major fault.  We did wait a while for the dessert course and to get the check.  Make sure to visit this fantastic Italian eatery!",

My friend also had the same thing but he was too nice to say anything. I let the waitress know about the saltiness and she apologised and said they'll remake the pasta. According to her, the chef said all the saltiness came from the clam and it wasn't his fault. In my opinion, any chef that doesn't take responsibility for how his food taste to his guests doesn't deserve his own restaurant. The pasta that they replaced came out bland and flavourless - like the chef was mad about the salt comment and so he doesn't season this one with any salt.   Does not recommend.   2 stars because the waitress did her best to make a bad situation better.",

Tonight my wife and I popped in; the cozy location makes you know you are definitely not at a mega-strip location. You can get good meals throughout Las Vegas, but eating a great meal in your neighborhood is exceptional. Wait staff who recognize and remember you, and an engaging chef are unique.  The menu has great, perfectly executed standards,  but also has a changing variety of fresh, seasonal, specially sourced or local menu specials.  Every meal I've had here has exceeded my expectations. Chef Marc makes rounds throughout the dining room while orchestrating the kitchen and after talking to us has tweaked our meals just slightly based on our preferences. That type of attention to detail and willingness to create a special experience combined with Chef Marc's ability to perfectly execute his concepts are stellar. Every time we leave there, completely thrilled, the first thing my wife and I say is, \"we need to come here more often\".",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the best part of my meal was the bread and the salad. I started with the Roasted Beet salad and it was excellent. I then did something wild and crazy. I ordered an entree that I was not familiar with, Gnocchi Pink Basil. I thought I would be adventurous and try something different. The Gnocchi Pink Basil is described as \"In a Pink Vodka Sauce with Pancetta & English Peas.\" I had no idea what Gnocchi or Pancetta was, but I know what Pink Vodka Sauce is. That is what drove me to order this entree in the first place. My bad. This dish may be seriously on point. However, I did not care for it at all. That's on me and not the entree. However, the Pink Vodka Sauce in my estimation was not on point and this is where I felt the dish fell flat. My next surprise came when the side of \"Seasonal Roasted Vegetables\" that I ordered came to my table. Their idea of Seasonal Roasted Vegetables came in the form of sauteed Broccolini. Huh? I like greens, but I did not care for this. Next time I will be sure to ask what the Seasonal Roasted Vegetables are before I order. I have to tell you that at this point I am completely confused. I am looking at both items in front of me and I don't care to eat either. And you have to understand, I am like the kid in the commercial, Mikey. Like Mikey, I will eat just about anything. Heck, if I can't eat it I will take it home and try it later. I am not shy about taking leftovers home. Not this time. Unfortunately, our waitress was completely unaware. It was Saturday evening and the store was totally jam up. As a result she wound up in the weeds and had that \"Deer in Headlights\" look. Poor baby. We were going to share a dessert, but it was all we could to get, and pay our check. That said, I am looking forward to returning during the week and trying something less adventurous.",

All were quite good. For main courses, we ordered the cheese and spinach raviolli, ahi tuna, chicken parmigian, the chicken pasta, and the veal. The pasta was right on, with freshness and the right mixture of texture and taste that only Chef Marc could concoct. The chicken was very tender, and was seasoned well. Chef Marc was petsonally giving a description of his specials of the day. Overall, it was a great night out in a neighborhood restaurant. Hope this establishment will be here to stay!",

Each soup was a really large bowl (only $7) and really delicious. The soup came with a very nice bread basket, could have been a whole meal. For main courses we had the short ribs and eggplant parmigiana and both dishes were excellent. The chef came out to talk to each table of diners, and that was a nice touch. I think this is an excellent restaurant.",

Amazing meal for him and he was extremely impressed and loved everything Chef Marc chose. Chef Marc also came to our table during the meal to talk to my husband about what he had prepared and our waiter gave him the names of the wines he liked the best. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and the arugula salad and it was fabulous. As a special treat the desert was a large enough serving of Tiramisu for us to share. Thank you to the staff and Chef Marc for a wonderful dinner and evening.",

    "text": "Having only enjoyed Chef Marc's wonderful cuisine through special events, I was excited to finally try some of his traditional Italian fare.  His passion for cooking is  felt by anyone he interacts with.  That enthusiasm is easily transferred because I was ready to order everything after listening to him go over the specials on a recent Friday night.  Burrata is to mozzarella as toro is to tuna.  Buttery, creamy, rich and dare I say eggy; it was excellent with just a touch of aged balsamic, but even better with the fresh tomato and greens.  I am sure their caprese salad is very good as well, but this is worth the extra $4.    \"Fruiti di Mar\" was fruits of the sea indeed!  The entree was filled with a more than generous helping of mussels and clams along with shrimp and calamari.  My toes tapped to a seafood symphony that only I could hear in my head.  Substituting the linguine for Marc's freshly made black pappardelle was an outstanding decision by me.  \"Pappare\" means \"to gobble up\" in Italian.  That shit was pappared!  More casual than fancy in atmosphere, this restaurant makes for a terrific neighborhood spot that hopefully sticks around for the long haul.  I'd gladly choose this over the other trattoria's in Summerlin.",

But after about 10 minutes the host wanted to seat us at a high top near the bar. We asked if we could sit at a regular table, but because it was set for four, the host didn't want to seat us there :/ (although there was another table of 2 sitting at a 4-top). He ended up seating us there but it didn't leave us with a good first impression.  Onto the food...  Calamari - not good, very little flavor. A little salt in the batter would've made a big improvement. The marinara sauce was good so it made the dish edible, but without it, the calamari would've been tasteless.  Wild Mushroom Ravioli - outstanding! Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a hint of truffle.   Shrimp Parmesan - not what we were expecting, it's like chicken Parmesan but with shrimp. The shrimp is battered and fried with melted cheese on top.  Gnocchi Bolognese - again, sauce was good but the gnocchi had no flavor. Maybe they ran out of salt in the kitchen?? I asked my husband if he tricked me by taking me to a \"healthy\" restaurant (read: no salt, no flavor). The gnocchi was cooked well, but I was disappointed.   Service was a little slow, but the restaurant was busy. I don't think we'll be back, unfortunately.",

We ate here twice in one week and that is something we never do.  It was really, really good.    Reservations are a must as they have a base of regulars and deservedly so.  The chef came out on our first visit and spent some time explaining the menu items. Our server was prompt, polite and extremely knowledgeable as well as honest in his explanations.  The wine is fairly priced - about 1 and 1/2 to 2 times what it sells for at Lee's.  Everyone made us feel at ease and very welcome.    On our second visit, they called me ahead of time to ask if I would mind a different table assignment - very thoughtful.  They also prepared a dish, not on the menu that evening - just for us.  Their menu specials change daily.  We will visit Marc's  on a regular basis.  Plan on around $140 for a couple if you get a nice bottle of wine, entrees, sides and dessert.  Non drinkers, thrifty types can share a main dish and side, drink water and can get out for less than $30 - $35.  But what's the fun in that?  They have happy hour specials, but we have not tried them yet.  It gets noisy on busy nights, but not as bad as some restaurants I've visited.  Wouldn't surprise me if they outgrew this facility in the future.  I highly recommend this place.",

Upon entry, I was greeted by the kind gentleman host. I saw my friend over at the bar, she walked over and then we were seated.  The space for this restaurant is intimate and small. The warm tones of the interior made us feel cozy on this rainy evening. I chose to drink a glass of the Super Tuscan wine. I then chose the Chicken Marsala. This is one of my favorite dishes so I try it wherever I am if I see it on the menu. I also ordered a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. My friend chose the Shrimp Scampi over Linguine. The Lobster Bisque was rich, creamy and flavorful. There were nice size chunks of Lobster in the Bisque which I was surprised to see. Not a lot of them but enough. Next came the entrees. My dinner selection was the wrong choice in this instance. I found the sauce to be a little too sweet and it did not compliment the chicken. The mushrooms were very good though. There was also a side of zucchini which I also liked. My friend really loved her shrimp scampi and it was lovely presentation. Both entrees were big so we ended up taking a to go bag. I waited and waited for Chef Marc to come over to our table which so many Yelpers had stated in their reviews but he never did. I saw him go to other tables though. No big deal! I would probably return one more time to try something else. It may have been an off night so a return trip might be in order.",

It seems like this restaurant used to be a gem, but my visit here was extremely disappointing. The ambience seemed off and generally the restaurant is dated, it doesn't reflect the prices on the menu. The food, I can mostly only attest to the happy hour menu, was uninspired. The meatballs were the epitome of average, the happy hour sausage dish was unremarkable in any way, the salad was just bad there was no craft put in. It doesn't seem like the ingredients here are sourced properly, nor does the food taste made from scratch. It just generally felt like a dead decaying place, the food came nowhere close to the artistic way it's presented through the photos here on yelp in the descriptions in the menu. Places like this need to be cultivated, there should be a robust cocktail list the either evokes Italian spirit culture or 20s speakeasies, a smaller but handcrafted meticulous menu, a more updated decor. I wish the Chef heeds this review, I'd be extremely happy to return and try again. Places like this should be thriving not stagnating in quality.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Italian restaurant! This restaurant is very elegant, with professionally dressed waitstaff and a greeter who is super friendly. The entire restaurant has a warm family style feel. First off, the bread basket-it was amazing! The bread you could tell was homemade, and it actually tasted like pizza crust. My favorite part was the pieces of bread that were dipped in sauce which was very unique. My favorite part of the entire meal was the beet salad. I would come here just for that! There were red beets with candied walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese. It was such a unique and tasty mix of extreme flavors. They had an entire menu of daily specials. We tried to bucatini with broccoli rabe and the spaghetti tortuffo. These were both on the very large menu of specials for the day. Both dishes were delicious, with al dente pasta and freshly prepared sauces.",

What a great surprise as we remember the incredible dishes he prepared for us 15 years ago!!! So, appetizers are 1st class - prosciutto n figs are sooo fresh and delicious. Garlic bread is sinful. The lettuce for the salads is unreal and one of a kind. He makes all dressings here!! Already it reminds me of the old restaurant, he always uses the best ingredients. Service is on point as always in his places. Marc STILL goes around and talks to all the tables. He loves what he does and it shows. His agnolotti is dynamite, lamb, chicken and beef. Ask for it!! Oh wait... dinner came.just, look at the pictures and salivate. Bon appetit",

All of the items that he recommended were well thought out, with perfect pasta to sauce ratios, the salad selection was well proportioned with salad dressing and all of the ingredients were in season. Our table shared appetizers, soup and salad and many main entree dishes and desserts were shared family style. There was plenty to eat, without feeling too full.",

Come to find out that Marc is from Utica NY which is a stone's throw from my Hometown of Syracuse NY. We were Greeted by Luigi in the most gracious Italian style and I Loved It. I asked to talk to Marc & his bartender Sam & they are both Great Friends of one of my Best Friends Johnnie J. Two great guys right here. Upon looking at the Menu I saw Greens & Beans and ordered this. Others ordered Duck & Veal & Chicken Parm. I then asked if they made Utica Greens and the waitress Antoinette looked at me and said Yes we do & what amount of Heat would you like. I chose a #3 and smiled the Biggest Smile I could just because I have not had this dish in over a Decade. I then Enjoyed the Best Utica Greens I ever had. Thx Marc for making this dish the way its supposed to be made. We also enjoyed a great glass of Malbec & Birthday Girl Angela has some Moscato which she Loved. Wine menu was super and they had all kinds that everyone would enjoy. All of our meals were Plentiful and delicious. I can Honestly say that we will return to Marc's as much as Possible, believe me. If you are in the area of 8615 Sahara West do yourself a favor and stop for dinner. Better yet make reservations to be assured of getting in as I know this place will be dynamite for dinner and word of mouth will get around quickly. Please say Hi to Marc & Sam for me.  Buona Salute.

The second dish was the first time I've ordered it here: Squid inc pasta w calamari, reminds me of the squid inc pasta from Clarettas back in Florida. perfectly cooked pasta and I loveee the use of calamari instead of shrimp. That 4 cheese spinach mushroom app though. NOTHING beats the bello  if you're not starving it can definitely suffice as an entree but it's fun to try other things. Especially if you get another app or half order of pasta. Love this place.",

Started with lemon drop martinis and a dirty martini, made via our server's recommended vodka.   Moved on to the mushroom app- made with strong cheeses of Gorgonzola, Romano and pecorino and earthy, meaty mushrooms with spinach. Make sure to save some bread to dip in all the cheesy goodness. Very rich, but very worth it. Both drinks paired well with this appetizer. 5/5  I tried the frutti di mar. The assortment of shellfish were plentiful and fresh. Served in a slightly briney tomato sauce tossed in an especially special pillowy linguine, cooked perfectly and made in house. The sauce coated the fish and linguine with tons of flavor. 5/5  The fella tried a stuffed pasta in red sauce, overall the dish was good but very salty. 3.5/5  Chef Marc stopped by a couple of times to see how we were doing and our server didn't miss a beat. Great evening, all-in-all!",

The type of food was great and even tasted better! The service was top of its class! Specially our server Jiovanna! She was funny, fast, and was on top of all of our request! Chef Marc took the time to come out and explain the menu and how it differs from the rest and why he chose what was on the menu! Drinks were on point! I ordered about 4 Long Island and all taste great! Just enough alcohol to feel good but not really taste the alcohol! Some Long Islands are too strong and you can't even finish the drink but some are not strong enough and it's nothing but an Arnold Palmer but the bartender got it right on point! Overall food quality, service, and drinks were all 5 stars! Even the location, no where near the strip so parking was good! Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good Italian food!",

    "text": "Looking for good, soulful Italian fare. New in town here. have to say I am left intrigued but disappointed at the overall experience. What I liked: fresh bread was fantastic, the tomato flatbread that came hand in hand was too overpowering for side bread. The good quality olive oil they had was enough to carry it through taste wise.  Escargots: I liked that the shells were off, it soaked a buttery tangy sauce. What I didn't like: the croutons with the dish had no correlation in texture or taste wise in compliments with the star of the show. The bread provided had more satisfaction as opposed to the former.  My partner had the veal: Beautifully done. Sauce was fantastic. No complaints except wanting more.  Myself; had the truffle pasta with extra truffle. Pasta made al dante and fresh. This dish is the heart of any altruistic Italian cuisine, emphasising on the focus minimalistic ingredients with maximisation of flavour.   Here is the BIG letdown: desserts. Here is the breakdown   Creme Brulee: taste was good. But why on God's green earth is it cold. Is creme brulee not a warm dessert?! It came cold, the creme was stiff. Bleagh.   Cannoli: All the characters from the godfather would never acknowledge this.... monstrosity. The shell was hard, almost as though it has sat its good length of its shelf life in the freezer... supposed ricotta/cream filling was powdery. Gross. Down right disgraceful on Italian cuisine.   Chocolate mousse cake: in short: tasted worse than what one would bought at Albertsons. Albertsons would have tasted better.   Willing to give the main courses a second shot because i believe it has potential but the dessert I would stay away like a plague. Yes This review is harsh, but when priced at 170++ for food and wine alone one would expect leaving the grounds more satisfied as I had been.",

His New York City personality is welcoming, passionate for food and fun to listen too. His staff hosts respect and class like private butlers.  The flavor is to not die for, but to relive again and again, each time more luscious and wholesome than the last as seasons change.  Such a charming atmosphere.

Food was very good - looks like we finally found our non-chain local Italian joint.  The charcuterie board was of better quality and quantity compared to about 12 others we have had in west side of town - bread is fresh made and very good.  Meatballs actually have more meat than breadcrumbs - they were a bit crustier than I prefer but wife loved them - veal was also good not the best in town but top 5.  Homemade pasta was good - it was cooked a little too much so not as firm as I like it.  Definately going back.",

Lettuce in the Caesar salad wasn't dried properly making it a watery disaster. The malfiata/deconstructed lasagna was unremarkable. The sauce was lacking in flavor and the whole dish wasn't nearly as good (conceptually or taste-wise) as a traditional lasagna. The special that night -- mafalda with oxtail ragout -- was the highlight of the night. I like the texture of the loosely cut pasta and the ragout was beefy and rich. Since my visit was shortly after they opened, chances are I'll be back to give them another shot.",

The host was super friendly. Our server was nice and had a lot to remember (at least 5 specials which all sounded good.).  The bread to start was fine. But this killed it for me: at a spot like this, please served fresh butter. Not the margarine in the plastic mold where you peel back the plastic and dig your butter knife in. Honestly, even the BF was surprised at this. I will say the wine our was on the heavy side (bonus!).   We started with a Caesar salad. It was fine but not what I expected from Chef Marc having been to Parma and Mezzo Bistro in the past. Dressing lacked a discernible anchovy taste to the point where I can't even say for sure there were anchovy's in the dressing. To me, a Caesar dressing without anchovy is not a Caeser.   I ordered the clam linguini. It was just okay. The dish could have used more salt and sauce. The pasta was kind of clumping together so I think sauce would have helped.   The BF ordered one of the specials, steak with hot peppers. There's a chicken dish on the menu with this preparation but the steak was one of the specials. It was DELICIOUS. The pasta was perfect, steak was good, but the sauce, oh the sauce, it was freaking fantastic! We asked for more bread so we could sop off the sauce. (The second offering of bread was about quarter the size of the first.)  Overall, it was an okay meal. We will definitely go back because having been to Chef Marc's previous restaurants, I know there is potential here. Next time though, I'll order one of the specials.",

Some of my faves are the portabello appetizer, chicken riggies, and chicken marsala. Can't get enough of Chef's bolognese sauce. Can I just hook that sauce up to my veins? Thanks, Chef Marc for amazing food!",

    "text": "Well let me start by saying we LOVE Chef Marc.  Love his passion for what he does, love talking to him in the restaurant, love the excitement he has when he is describing a dish he is concepting or preparing.   Very cool.   We are actually not from Vegas, but went a number of times to PARMA, his other place which closed down in 2015.   We loved the food there and the vibe, and were excited to come try his new place knowing what we know.    That being said, I can't say I will be back.  :(    The food was - well, unextraordinary.  If I am going to drive from the strip where I normally stay to a more local's place (which I did for Parma a bunch of times), I have to leave feeling I had an amazing meal.  That didn't happen here.  (This would be a 3.5 star review if it could be ).  We started with his warm portabello spinach salad, something he served at Parma off the menu if you knew to order it.  Yummy.   With it they brought out a basket of bread.   There was some warm chewy italian bread at the bottom of the basket, and on top were some strips of something covered in sauce and a bit of cheese.  The first thing I noticed as I grabbed them was how cold and mushy they were.  Kinda like if you grabbed an old cold sponge from your neighbor's sink?   The consistency was NOT nice.  Took one bite and set it aside.  Why serve that?  Even complementary.  Yuk.  The garlic bread Marc served at Parma was amazing, one of my favorite parts of the meal, and that was an opinion shared by many people I brought there over the years.  This bread basket didn't come close.  We got the Pasta Fagiole soup as well.  White bean soup, but really, looked like just a bowl of white beans in a white sauce.  I rarely if ever add salt and pepper to restaurant dishes, but this  soup needed lots of help.  Not only did it look unappetizing, it didn't taste like much either.   We actually didn't finish it, which is sad.    We shared two main courses, A veal saltimbocca (one of my favorites) and a spaghetti carbonara.   The dishes were presented nicely, but taste wise, they were bland.  I was really sad.  I LOVE a good meal and was really excited to come here.   The veal portion was large, but the taste was, well, just meh.  Again we didn't finish the dish.  And the Carbonara, which I know is open to all kinds of debate as to whether to add cream (non traditional) vs. just egg and cheese, that's all good but our dish.. well.   Have you ever seen food if it sat under a heat lamp a really long time?  Kinda dried out and tired?   That was what I thought of when I had this.  Just clumpy, sticky, stiff, and lacking flavor on top of it.   And believe me it makes me sad to write that.  It just didn't meet our expectations.    Service started out well, but after we were served the main courses our waiter disappeared.  GONE.  When I wanted a check ( half hour or 45 minutes after) I finally flagged down another waiter and asked for it, and then our waiter appeared to give it to us.  Not cool.     We brought in our own bottle of wine, which we do from time to time.   I am cool with a corkage fee, I think the restaurants should make something, so that doesn't bother me.  A $25 corkage fee, though, I think is a bit excessive.   You should be forewarned if you are planning on bringing in your own wine.    I really would love it if Marc read this, and maybe changed some things.  I'd love to see him thrive, and I am rooting for him.   Maybe it is assistant chefs not following his recipes, maybe some of his dishes just need a bit of tweaking, but the way it is right now, I can find better restaurants in Vegas to head to when I am there visiting.",

Everything is homemade and chef Marc only sources the best quality products; so I just do the Chef Tasting and Wine Pairing Menu, plus I'll order a table wine (to keep us going between pours).  I just tell him fish, meat, spicy or creamy...whatever I'm in the mood for and he hits it out the park every time.  I've spent 20 odd years in Vegas so I have a special kind of despise for the strip and I just want to say, sincerely, it's places like this (and all of his prior restaurants) that make living here so great.  Top, top Italian-American food...and if you know your shit; you can get amazing traditional Italian food here too.",

    "text": "My admiration for Chef Marc is no secret: I've followed him through three restaurants and offshoot VPN Novecento pizza joints with a dedication usually reserved only for Deadheads on tour. He is that good: nay, great!   The things I most enjoy about Marc are his genuine passion for Italian/Italian-American cuisine interspersed with his Asian and world travel influences on his menus. He cooks from his soul, and it shows when he talks with love about the food, decor, and his vision for your dining experience. The menu will be a work in progress; I can suggest for sure that the $60 five course \"Chef's Surprise\" tasting menu will be fantastic; he creates inspired cuisine and sources locally when possible.   So impressed with my dinner last evening that my Parental Units are booking their holiday block party with him, and along with hubby, were already waiting for him to open to have our Vegas post elopement celebration meal.   Years ago Nelson hosted epic UYEs at Parma, I expect Marc to eclipse the high bar he set for those and the scores of meals shared with family and friends enjoyed over the years. Marc is the real deal, I'm borderline sad I live in AZ now, because I'd be eating here once a week!  * Cold Seafood Salad appetizer was amazing *  ** House baked bread is soft and perfect for sopping up the tasty sauces **  *** Mozzarella en Carozza is Italian grilled cheese comfort food ***  **** I created Wild Shrimp and Mussels in spicy white sauce = amazing! ****  ***** house made pastas are perfection *****  Shout out to Lino, our Italian waiter, and Tracey, who Parma regs will recognize.   Have the Creme Brulee torched table side, and thank me later.",

Sincerely impressed with the good mix of old school Italian charm and hospitality and modern twist to traditional Italian dishes but always inspired by its roots.     I couldn't decide on one dish so I did the tasting menu. I loved everything presented in front of me.   The fried zucchini flower with uni just knocked my socks off and my favorite tasting dish of the night.  Unexpected was the the fava bean leaves(salad)...completely unexpected and expanded my horizons in salad greens.  Perfectly seasoned and a nice light dish before the remaining three dishes and dessert (surprise).  The Argentinian Srimp Pasta was well balanced, and the veal was just perfect.   What is more exciting is really the experimentation and usage of fresh and wholesomely raised ingredients, as well as influence of Asian techniques and ingredients. Forgive me for not using the correct terms but basically Chef Marc is really raising the bar by experimenting.  I love it and I am game for every experimental dish as I love tasting every brilliant bite.   So excited to come back and just keep experimenting (eating!), as it makes each occasion a new and different one.",

The meal started with a nice glass of Riesling that I enjoyed. The bread with dipping oil was delicious as well. The Caesar Salad was a generous portion and good.   My Wild Shrimp Fra Diavola was the highlight of the meal. This dish comes with the option of spice level ranging from one to four and I opted for a two which added some heat without losing any flavor. The shrimp was so good and fresh! I also loved the housemade pasta and delicious red sauce. I'd definitely order this dish again. For a sweet ending my friend and I shared the Banoffee Pie. I was excited to see this rare dessert on the menu and loved the flavor of the pie. It was a refreshing summer dessert.   Our service throughout the meal was excellent. Our server was Sam if memory serves me right. Regardless, our server was professional and enhanced our dining experience. Our drinks were refilled often and anything we requested was provided quickly.",

The bread and focaccia are so good, perfectly baked. We started with the giant tortilleni with truffles, off the charts. We also shared the Utica greens, made with escarole, pancetta, and beans, it's always great and this time it was better than great. One of us ordered the Osso Bucco, which could have been cut with a fork as well as the veal marsala. I ordered the Veal parm, always crispy and light and finally the black linguine and seafood dish which is another one of Marc's greatest hits. The service was great, ambiance lively and comfortable. Can you tell we love Marc's Trattoria",

Chef Marc himself talked us through the menu, discussing his creation process for dishes and some of the trusted places he sources from. He also checked in with us later in the meal and his staff members were all highly attentive and kind throughout the evening.   The menu has both traditional and adventurous dishes - something for everyone. Chef Marc is a master of his craft and loves what he does, which is woven into his food. I guess the secret ingredient really is love.",

I made a Yelp reservation and the process was great. The staff was very nice and attentive. Our waiter was very descriptive about every dish we asked about; he definitely knew his stuff! Chef Marc graciously greeted every table in the restaurant - you don't get to see the chef that often in other places.  Let's start with appetizers. As previously mentioned - THE PORTOBELLO APP. It was amazingly delicious. The main ingredients were quite simple: portobello mushrooms, cheese, and spinach. It may not sound like much but I promise you, it is!  Frutti Di Mare w/ black pasta: This was good - but not my favorite. It smelt and tasted like the ocean. I absolutely love seafood but it was a little overwhelming for my taste. However, it was jam packed with seafood. & I got a cute fork & little bowl break open my shellfish.  Short Rib Malfatti: Not bad at all - the short ribs and pasta were cooked perfectly.   To be completely honest, the entrees didn't excite me; but it could be because I was too busy wishing I had more of my portobello appetizer!  Dessert: Creme Brulee & Berry Sorbet  The Creme Brulee was smaller than I wish it would be (I love dessert) but it was still a nice way to end my meal. The berry sorbet was amazing! A perfect palette cleanser  and amazingly fresh.   Maybe I should have an appetizer and dessert reservation this week...",

The restaurant wasn't crowded and we were basically ignored. It was as if we were invisible. Took, 15 minutes for the server to even acknowledge we were there. We ordered a bottle of wine, it was delivered and then we waited and waited and waited. Chef Marc, always makes rounds to the tables, greats his quests. He did so, last night but again we were ignored. He never came by our table, as he has done every time I have dined there. We finally flagged over our waiter and asked her for some bread. She seemed put out, to be having to even wait on us. Had a definite attitude, borderline rude. We finally ordered dinner. Another server delivered it. He asked how everything was, we told him the other server was less than par. He then stepped it up, was attentive and friendly. The food is always stellar, and  a highlight of the evening. The second server made the balance of our evening enjoyable. Without him, I would have given 2 stars, but gave 3 because the food is great, and the atmosphere enjoyable. But, with the awful service we received I'll have to think twice about going back.",

Parking is super easy as there were plenty of spots available.   Restaurant is closed Monday's and Tuesday's so make sure you pay attention, do make a reservation as it can get packed. The restaurant is already fairly popular on this side of town, there's plenty of buzz about it. The ambience is pretty classy. I'd say dress formal, I know it's Vegas but it's in a nice area and has more \"mature\" crowd.   I like to have a few drinks by the bar before I sit, they have a good house cab and offer beers. The pasta fagiole is awesome, please try it if you like soups. The chicken parm is perfection, just enough cheese where your not drowning in it and definitely plentiful.   The service was impeccable, I've been here 4 times already and they always offer something new or different. Chef Marc is very detailed and descriptive, the way he talks about his process shows how passionate he is about his food and restaurant. I'm from back east and there aren't to many Italian joints off the strip than can compare to this joint, won't disappoint.",

    "text": "On Friday night (9 June 2017) we got reservations. Service was what I expected and did not disappoint, but the entree DID!    Our starters were great, but the BLACK PASTA With truffle cream, peas, topped with \"Jumbo Lump Crab\" was ruined by the fishy smelling & tasting faux CRAB MEAT.  The pasta and truffle cream sauce was great - but when you put FISH (with strong fishy taste) on top it SUCKS!  We we went to Chef Marc's (Marc Sgrizzi) Trattoria because this dish was specifically written up in Las Vegas Weekly (June 6-14, page 14). We decided to give it a try. But Chef Marc's raising the price by 23% and serving FISH as CRAB is BAD, BAD, BAD. TERRIBLE!  The Las Vegas Weekly write up said \"this unorthodox masterpiece .. fresh house-made black fettuccine gets all sauced up with truffle cream and quite a bit of jumbo lump crab meat.\" $26 (Chef Marc's printed menu was $32)  Now I am wondering why his previous restaurant - Parma - closed only to open this one 4 months later. [\"A tipster writes in to Eater that the spot \"hasn't been open for weeks\" and the phone is disconnected. All the signs for the restaurant are still up, and there's no indication on the front door or on the restaurant's Facebook page and Website that it's closed permanently or indefinitely.\" by Susan Stapleton Jul 13, 2015]   SHAME, SHAME, SHAME",

My husband got the Veal Chop Tartufo, and I got the Filet Mignon El Chico (medium rare). Both were the best Veal & Filet Mignon we've ever had. My husband didn't stop with the fork and knife; decided to say \"screw utensils\" literally chewed down to the bone with his hands. Hands down a new favorite, and cannot wait to come back!!  Special thanks to Chef Marc for the Anniversary Tiramisu,  the best!",

    "text": "Chef Marc has such a huge following around the valley and it's for good reason. I wrote a review for his more casual Parma years ago, and was saddened (as everyone was) when it had closed. While it was a nice respite to be able to see his fresh pasta at farmers markets and to visit his pizza place (now also closed), I missed the sit down dining experience with his warm hospitality.  Enter Chef Marc's Trattoria. I bookmarked it shortly after opening but I'm ashamed to say that my mantra to eat less carbs (for some reason my brain doesn't count dumplings?) kept me from coming here as soon as I wanted to. It wasn't until my best friend was craving Italian that I suggested knowing JUST the place.  In summary, we were in the mood for classics. We shared a caesar salad which was exactly what you'd expect it to be although the dressing was just a touch lighter than most which was welcome. We also had the clams with linguine and the eggplant parmesan. Chef Marc came out to touch tables, as he does, and we got into it about different pasta textures, our favorites, and which hold different sauces better for different purposes etc. He mentioned that they had a house made bucatini that day, and I became VERY excited as thats my absolute favorite. I subbed that in for my pasta side alongside the eggplant parmesan.  The eggplant parm seemed less like it was dredged through breadcrumbs, and more like it was just crisp egg batter, and it was a welcome change. It gave the dish a lightness without sacrificing any of its silky richness. The bucatini was the first thing I finished- mm! The linguine with clams is just EXACTLY right. It hit all the right flavors and I still dream about it. Fresh clams, lemon, garlic, white wine, parsley and homemade pasta all humbly married together in harmony. It was spectacular.  If you're looking for classics, this is tops if you want to avoid the strip and breaking the bank. I have yet to try any of their more creative dishes, but look forward to the opportunity to visit again in the (hopefully) near future! Also, the music was on point with classics like Sinatra setting just the right mood.",

One of the waiters on the inside came out told me the fish was just swimming yesterday. Don't believe it if it was fresh it would've been flaky not mushie!! To make it right they took off Two cans of Coke .Classy not! Also one other drink. Gave us one dish of sorbet! Not bad  I guess they figured we wouldn't come back any why make it! I left a message told the Cook he should try the fish! Because no chef would have served that kind of fishy fish!! I don't know maybe they thought we were just looking for a discount but we took two bites of each of the fish terrible, mushy, Dry , extremely fishy!!  Service was good took us 30 minutes to get our salad!  Not the best experience By no means!!!",

However the plain bread (which was warm) that was also in the basket was phenomenal.   I have been waiting for a place like this to open away from the strip.   The Chef also came around and made sure everyone was content.  A very nice touch.   If you feel like eating authentic Italian.  Give this place a shot.  It will not disappoint.

Discovered this place from Yelp reviews so, even though I selfishly don't want to refer people here out of fear of not being able to get in, my conscience tells me I need to pay the favor forward & give thanks to Mark & ALL his team.   You know how they say- \"If you want good Italian, you've gotta go to Italy\". I bought into that school of law my entire life. I've eaten at every popular Italian spot in Vegas & I can tell you; The food will transport you back to Italy without leaving Vegas. Even better, it's equal to the top restaurants in Italy. I know, I know... I can hear what you're thinking; \"That's a BOLD statement\", and yes, yes it is. Also, a factual one. I dare you to challenge me, (just save me a table).   Chef Marc travels periodically to Italy to continue his study of Italian Cuisine so make sure you call ahead, when he's in Italy, they close for a couple weeks. He visits each table nightly & is so darn likable & obsessed with flavor, you'll want to invite him over to your house to cook, & he does catering, I asked.   The restaurant is comfortable with dark(ish) ambiance, has a good romantic vibe. Some tables are NYC style, close together, others tucked away in corners. They also have seating at the bar- lots of good choices!   Special shot out to the older gentleman maitre'd, his name I think is Luigi?? He's ADORABLE, get him chatting & he'll tell you lots of crazy stories about old Vegas lore.   We went last night & are going back tonight & bringing more friends. Will be our 5th trip in 2 months and that's w/ a break to Italy from Chef Marc. Don't judge- you'll be addicted too!",

More of a Northern Italian style.  We started with a glass of Chianti and the hot seafood appetizer. A bountiful plate of clams, mussels, calamari, and eggplant was presented to us (large enough to be the dinner for the two of us, but we didn't stop with appetizers).  The shell fish were cooked to perfection, and the squid was perfectly cooked, not rubbery, but aldente and full of flavor.  My wife ordered the pasta with boar meat which had more of a taste of meat stock than it's tomato base, and I had the eggplant parm.  The eggplant was light and battered with egg.  A delightful dish which I enjoyed again as leftovers the next morning.  It was accompanied by a brimming bowl of delightfully tasty pasta.  Our desert and latte's were a wonderful conclusion to a delightful meal.  The service was exceptional, and we appreciated the chef coming to our table and introducing himself.  It was a perfect dinner to accompany a delightful evening.  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "This review is for the restaurant week menu.  Our reservation was at 6:15 PM and the restaurant was doing a brisk business. Most tables were occupied. The staff was energized and Chef Marc was busy helping the servers which left little time to talk to the customers as he usually does. However, I was able to get his attention and congratulate him on a fantastic menu.  The menu was a four course dinner with an choice of one from two items in each course. Our choice was: Imported Buratta Salad with Arugula, Cabernet tomatoes and Balsamic dressing. The cheese was silky and paired well with the sweet tomatoes and fresh greens   Mussels Farro, from Apulia & Adriatic sea with farro, beans and  Mirepoix. This dish was like a seafood stew with only one item from sea. Different but delicious.  Pappardelle Wild Boar Bolognese, fresh made pasta with Chef Marc's Tuscan Bolognese. Wow a fantastic dish. Perfectly cooked pasta and a wonderful tasting Boar Bolognese. This is a meal in itself.  Ora King Salmon, oven roasted and herb crusted. A nice piece of juicy salmon. It was the perfect size after the previous courses. Although, not part of the dinner our server provided a side dish of Broccolini.  Dessert was not part of the dinner and was not missed as there was no room   Kudos to Chef Marc and his team for a very enjoyable dinner.",

The specials are a bit pricey at $50+ compared to other pasta and meat dishes on the menu, however I will say they were devoured by folks eating with me.  They have a good wine list and reasonably priced.  The chef also made his rounds to each table which is always a nice touch.  I will definitely be visiting again.",

We had the Vegetarian Ravioli for an app, the Ora King Salmon (to DIE for) and the Duck Ragu. And we topped it off with a slice of Lemoncello Cake. We'll be back for sure!",

Our waiter was so knowledgeable about all of the menu items and he made everything sound sooo good . The entire staff was so attentive and friendly . The chef even came out and greeted us twice .   Every single thing that I put in my mouth was exceptional . Let's start with the bread . They brought us out both homemade wheat and white bread and both were delicious . The crust was so crispy and the bread was warm .   We got the greens and they were very different from anything I've ever tried but were very tasty . I ordered the wedding soup and it was honestly one of the best soups I've ever tried . The broth is homemade along with everything else in this soup . This one is a must ! Now on to the main entrees ... I ordered the Wild Shrimp Fra Diavola and I loved it . I shared it with my mother and they split it for us . Even with us sharing we both didn't finish it . It was a great , large size portion . They ask you how spicy ( on a scale form 1-4) , I chose a 2 and it wasn't really spicy. I would definitely do a 4 next time . My step father ordered the Bucatini All'Amatriciana and that was fantastic . So flavorful and the guanciale was so crispy .   Finally we ordered a \" Banofee Pie\" and they it came out with a cheesecake gelato . It tastes like bananas foster on a dark chocolate crust ... and the cheesecake gelato ... OMG !   This place was such a gem . We all loved it !!! I would absolutely come back . If you are looking for some authentic Italian food , THIS IS YOUR PLACE .",

    "text": "Maybe it was a bad night for the restaurant, but it was inexcusable how they handled it and how poor the quality of the food was. We came here because of my friend's birthday because it was in the Desert Companion guide for being so good.   I cannot fathom how this restaurant is rated so well. Our experience started with being sat at 7pm (while others had already been dining for a while) and being told they were still putting together the menu for the night. This was actually exciting to us since it created an \"authentic\" feel. We ordered appetizers and entrees with our heavily accented and unprepared server (we gave her a Post-it because she didn't have a pad...) and began to wait. Our salads, appetizers, and the child's spaghetti and meatballs were brought out relatively quickly, but then we waited...and waited...and waited for another hour before our server came back at all.  At first the wait was nice. Most of us hadn't seen each other in a while and it was pleasant catching up. We had an amazingly well-behaved toddler with us who was almost falling asleep the second hour we were here since it was way past her bed time. Our water glasses were emptied and refilled twice in the hour of not hearing from or seeing our server and we were getting very hungry. Our server finally dained to swing by and let us know that their oven broke and our food should be out shortly...then, as she was about to walk away, though it was an afterthought, apologized for the wait. Then came the food.  The first two dishes that came out were incredible. The ribeye and pork chop looked (and tasted) fantastic. Everyone at the table could smell them and got excited for our own dishes. Next was the eggplant parm and octopus pasta. Covered in cheese, thick, juicy eggplant, and the smell all looked fantastic and made me really excited for my chicken parm! Here is where the True issues we had with the restaurant began.   The octopus pasta looked good, but not anything like the rest of the entrees. I found out later that the octopus was overcooked and the pasta undercooked. Then came the wild boar dish and my chicken parm. The boar dish (ordered by the aforementioned birthday girl) looked like green vomit on a plate and, according to the friend who got it, tasted much the same. My chicken parm was under-sauced (usually this is preferred, but something needed to mask the chicken), the sauce was of a poor quality and VERY acidic, had little cheese, and the chicken cutlets were miserable. It was like the chef had never heard of another seasoning besides salt. The chicken was dry, over-breaded, and reminded me of cheap chicken nuggets from a knockoff fast food joint. The accompanying pasta they brought out was under-cooked, so nothing pleasant there.  We were very polite about it and didn't complain until the manager and server pestered us twice each. From there, my friend's octopus dish was returned and removed from the check. They tried to give us desserts when we didn't want them, tried to convince us to have dessert, offered it to the now sleep-drunk child without permission AFTER we had turned down dessert repeatedly. The manager said he would do something about the rest of the awful dishes and must have forgotten because we got the check with only the octopus dish removed. We paid it and were asked multiple times if we were coming back. We declined to answer, to try and not be rude, but they knew...and kept asking over and over.  How did I have time to write such a long review? Well, that's a gift from the restaurant as well. The best part of this meal is that it caused me to lose some weight...because I'm now home with food poisoning. I'm exhausted, dehydrated, and beyond irate. If anyone from the restaurant decides to check out their reviews, know that we will NEVER be back.",

The space had an odd layout when it was a previous Italian restaurant and it remains so. There is no ambiance and the setting conflicts with the caliber of his food. Piping in Sinatra standards doesn't do the trick.  You can't really go wrong with any of the menu selections. Pastas are made fresh and their sauces are spot on. We enjoyed the burrata, cesar, chicken parm, rigatoni and tiramisu. The new space is meant to showcase Chef Marc's wonderful talent and provide a special experience. I felt l was dining in the Embassy Suites lobby for breakfast with people who just came from the gym.",

    "text": "Charming local place in which the owner plays a personal role in every aspect of the restaurant. I ordered the linguine with clams in a white wine sauce with haste as this was my go to meal across my trip in Southern Italy before Chef Marc could come to my table with a recommendation. He came by after I had placed my order, though and regularly checked in throughout my meal.  In the conversations I could overhear, I think it would be best to listen to him describe the meals as well as make recommendations as he really does it justice that way. It was like listening to chefs on food network describe their food with passion and detail. He was very personable and friendly to all customers, and knows a lot of them by name. I heard him check with the kitchen about my order as I had been sitting for a bit, but I didn't mind. My meal came and it did look different than the pictures. The clams were cooked well, it wasn't rubbery. But as I worked my way through the clams there was unfortunately many crunchy, unwanted surprises. This was also prevalent throughout the pasta itself. I brought this to the attention of Chef Marc who then swapped it out with a squid ink seafood pasta which was exceptionally cooked. The pasta was cooked well and the seafood had a nice bite to it.  I asked where he sources his seafood in which he knew the route and locations in which they all travelled, which I highly appreciated. He switches suppliers depending on the season for optimal taste.   TLDR; I will return as the second dish Chef Marc personally recommended was far more up to the other Yelpers standards they had set. I appreciate his artistry, passion, and dedication to his work and hope this restaurant thrives.",

Last Friday, we made a reservation and committed to ditching work and have a date night  Greeted by the cutest elderly host into a well AC room! (I've got to say, that AC in these summer days is a win already!)   Chef Marc found sometime to come out and greeted each guest personally which made us feel like home.  We ordered the pork chop that was teasing us on Instagram for months and a special, Linguini with grilled octopus.  Both plates were absolutely delicious!! perfect al dente linguini, tender octopus, and the Carolina Reaper chilis in the pork chop burn sooooo good we keep going back for more.  Needless to say, we're so happy to have finally tried Chef Marc.  The details and the passion shows in every bite and we felt like we're actually in Italy! what a sweet escape.   Not to mention Chef Marc is super supportive and gave so much advice and pointers to help our little start up grow and we have the utmost respect for such a kind human being.  Thanks Chef!",

    "text": "Chef Marc's Trattoria is an Italian restaurant outside of Summerlin in Las Vegas. It has killer reviews and I'm going to share my opinions about the food I had.   I'm going to start with the good points.  I love that they make their pasta fresh and in house. One thing they do is customize dishes. If it's not on the menu and they can make it then they will.   I had a real nice red pinot noir here. It was about $12 a glass. I'm no wino by any means but it was good, smooth.   The warm bread they make in house is nice. It's very simple and freshly made and you just can't beat that. They also have a room temperature pizza bread which was okay. I did like the heavy oregano taste, but some pieces had a heads to chew bottom. I don't mean chewy- I mean hard to chew.  On to some down sides.  We had their mushroom and spinach appetizer, their beet salad with blue cheese and nuts, and we had a spaghettini alle mare or seafood pasta, and gnocchi in pink sauce.   I was disappointed in the lack of flavor on all of these dishes-even just salt. I don't know if I went on an off night, but with all the great reviews I was sure I was in for an amazing meal.   The mushroom appetizer gets rave reviews but it legit has zero taste. Sauteed mushrooms and spinach with cheese baked on top? Maybe some fresh garlic, herbs, and salt would have made this better. I think this was $13  The beet salad was just beets on lettuce. The dressing or sauce seemed nonexistent. I think this was $13  My seafood pasta dish was a huge let down also. For $32 I thought it would be a decent portion and if not it should have had amazing flavor. The sauce it was cooked in was very bland. I don't do seafood and cheese often but I did opt for cheese later to add some salt. There was a chopped up soft shelled crab, a crab leg, two shrimp, and white fish. My friend came from the restroom and asked if I had already finished half of my meal but it was just really small.   The home made gnocchi in pink sauce was good. Little fluffy potato dumplings in pink sauce.   I don't know if I would give Chef Marc's another try. The space itself wasn't nice at all with an old Olive Garden decor. The food just wasn't good for the price either & I feel like a jerk for writing a bad review.  The reason my review stays neutral is the staff. I got this family vibe from the service but I felt it lacked a little in finesse but I had a soft spot for them. There was this super demanding guy complaining about them not having cheese ravioli and cheese pizza and I felt so bad. They did a great job with the guy even though he was a jerk and yelled at a staff member.   They did really well with refilling our drinks, getting things like salt and bread when requested, and I never felt like I couldn't find them when I needed them. Eliza from Poland was one of the staff helping us and I just thought she was very pleasant and sweet. She especially helped make the dinner a little more personal and intimate.  And last I'm not one to have a place make me something else. As a customer if I order something and it's not the best then hey it's still what I ordered. I'm not going to waste food because the thing I ordered wasn't good. If I ordered a steak rare and got well done then yes that's different. Anyways the server did ask and I told her and she did offer to have something else sent out. She did want me to enjoy my food but I was already ready to go. Great service though. It was a very welcome gesture to fix the issue.  I have been on this pasta kick and I've had some really delicious pasta dishes in the last couple of months. I'm no pasta expert but Chef Marc's just wasn't for me.",

He is innovative in his take on traditional dishes, such as lasagna which is done with short ribs and pappardelle noodles presented as a deconstructed lasagna.  We started with homemade bucatini Cacio e Pepe.  Just delicious.  I followed up with the Veal Chop Tartufo which, as Chef Marc described, was \"exploding with flavor.\"  It was absolutely delicious with a mushroom and truffle sauce.  Others had the chicken fra diavolo, shrimp scampi, and escargot,  all of which were deemed fantastic. The restaurant is casual but nice.  It is an easy place to have a relaxing dining experience.  Service is expert, knowledgeable and polished.  This is a special place and certainly distinctive.  Chef Marc's enthusiasm for his craft shows!",

    "text": "Yes, this is as good as it gets off of the strip for service and quality. I'm not going to tell you who I have dined here with because it is none of your business and get real, you are only here to hear about the food. Me, too.  Chef Marc is doing it big at his Trattoria. Fresh pasta, fresh bread, and hand picked ingredients from meat to veggies. When he talks I listen and drool a little. You can see and taste his passion with every dish. Nice touch was having Chef Marc call to confirm my reservations.   The staff is polished and actually appearing to not hate being at work. At no point in any of my meals did we feel rushed or processed. Our waiters remembered our names and used them throughout the service. The stealth busser quietly removed used wine glasses, plates, crumbs without any sign that she had been there which is how it should be.   The food: Oh my goodness. Every once in a while I will stumble upon a restaurant that pretty much ruins other restaurants for me. This is one of them. Now, when I crave Italian I cannot think of anywhere else I want to dine besides here. The Bolognese is complex and every chew brings a new welcoming flavor that stimulates my taste buds. The homemade breads are moist and garlicky. The fresh, homemade pasta goes down like BUTTA and doesn't leave you feeling like you just ate a bowl of Elmer's glue. The pancetta is worth every dimple it put on my thigh (shhhh). My latest love is the Limoncello cake. Nothing short of sensational. On all occasions the seafood dishes are a huge hit with the table. I wouldn't know because of my shellfish allergy. See, I am human.  I am not saying if you have traveled all around the world or lived in Italy for 100 years that you will love this place. I'm not saying that because you could still be an uppity prick with no palate. What I am saying is if you enjoy food where every bite is made with love and the seasonings dance in harmony on your tongue and you just LOVE Italian cuisine than RUN to Chef Marc's right now!",

Little creamy but not too much, with just the perfect seasoning. We tried also the spinach and cheese raviolis, so delicate and tasty. The dish of the day was squash ravioli with amaretto cookie crumbled on top of it. If you like to combine sweet and salty that's worth a try.   I was too full to order dessert especially because to start your dinner they bring you homemade garlic bread and focaccia that you can't help eating even though you know you're having pasta after. But my friends ordered Creme brulee and Tiramisu and loved it too.   So if you're craving for some authentic real Italian food this is the place you have to rush to.",

The server gave us extra bread to dip it in, so that was extra tasty. The seafood was cooked to perfection. We ordered the pork chop and rigatoni amatriciana. Both great dishes. The vegetables with the pork chop still had the snap they needed and weren't over cooked. The sauce for the rigatoni was nice and light. I only wish I found more pancetta. The tiramisu is out of this world. I loved how light the cream was and how the coffee flavor was not overpowering. Chef Marc does come by to make sure you are happy! I have not seen that since I lived in Chicago and went to mom and pop restaurants. It's rare in this city. We will be back and definitely recommend a stop by everyone to Chef Marc's Trattoria.",

Started with the Hot Seafood Appetizer and it was off the charts amazing. We had to order an extra loaf of freshly baked bread just to dunk in the sauce. Honestly we needed a straw to slurp it all up!  Then I had the vegetarian Ravioli and my husband had the Bolognese. Homemade pasta and perfectly proportioned.  Finished off with a complimentary crepe brulee and limoncello for our Anniversary.  The food and service was so mind blowing that I immediately messaged all my friends about it.  I love how Chef Marc comes by and explains his specials and answers questions you have on the menu.  Reminds me of the old restaurants when the owner would come by to each table and shake your hand and meet the family.  I love that. Highly recommended!",

I was a little disappointed with this one..... the toast was sitting in the oil and butter much to long,  and was way to soft, not the crunch I wanted at all.  Flavor was good, but with the soft creamy texture of the Escargot and the rich sauce, I really wanted the crunch of the french bread that I was used to getting previously at Chef Marc's other restaurant.  My Pappardelle Bolognese was perfect! Really.... simply perfect. The pasta was so fresh, absolutely homemade,  and the sauce was flavorful and rich, without overwhelming the pasta. Loved it!!!!!!

His previous endeavor, Parma, was a favorite of mine for lunch and now his great pasta dishes are back for dinner at Trattoria.   PORTABELLA APPETIZER: This is a must-get dish. Spinach and mushrooms in a creamy, cheesy sauce. What's not to love?! It's an indulgent start to your meal or potentially a vegetarian entree. MUSSELS IN FARRO: fresh-shelled mussels in farro with beans, decently made with a garlicky broth, no different than other mussels apps elsewhere but good. PAPPARDELLE WITH ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: Add the proscuitto for $4 to make this better. The ribbons of fresh pasta are wonderfully delicate and have perfect cook and texture. Sauce is light and buttery, the cruciferous vegetable and fatty ham work well together. FEGATINI DE POLLO: Think comforting spaghetti dish, but with chicken liver and a mushroom sauce, plus green beans and speck. It's hard to picture but was our favorite dish on our first visit. RUM CAKE: Light and moist with a frosted edge and fresh berries. The description provided by our server was a bit vague but this was a great pick over the usual (but well-executed) tiramisu or creme brulee.   The food is awesome. Worth waiting for, but better if you make a reservation. Prices are great for the quality and portions. As others have said, they could use an extra server at times, but Marc himself checks in on diners and ensures that things go smoothly.",

    "text": "They sat us down right at 6pm for our 6pm reservation. So bummed - we REALLY wanted to like this place. We came here based on the amazing Yelp reviews and are so disappointed. We got stuck at a high top table by the bar and it took a solid 15 mins for anyone to even come over and give us water and say hi.  It took 45 mins for our appetizers to arrive and all we ordered was a single meatball and a charcuterie board - which is basically cold cuts. We sucked it up and decided the dinner was going to be amazing so it would be totally worth the wait. Our main course came a little over an hour after being there.  The chicken Marsala was just ok and my side of pasta was cold. Not luke warm, but it was COLD. The spaghetti and meatballs was a whopping $22 and the meatballs were hard and dry and the spaghetti was a slight tint of red after being dipped in what was probably some sort of sauce, but there was no sauce on the plate anywhere.  We took a few bites and asked for the check - we just wanted out, we were sitting for waaaay too long. The table next to us got some cannolis and some sort of apology - they'd been there for a hot minute too. Sadly, we didn't get acknowledged or get any sort of consolation prize. The other reviews were great, so I'll have to chalk it up to maybe they were just having a bad night and give them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately no one tried to make it better. We won't be back and we are actually headed to In n Out Burger ",

Too bad was looking forward to a new neighborhood place to eat  Latest update.  Foods good I give them that. Seating and noise is a whole other issue. With all the glass windows sound just bounces all over and it's really hard at times to talk across the table to others.

Heartbroken that my beloved Parma had closed (I had a 4x/week habit for a time), I was eager to be one of the first patrons at Chef Marc's new Trattoria. Just entering the restaurant sets the mood. He's turned an overly curtained and tassled Indian venue into an elegant room - sophisticated, welcoming, warm, with the perfect lighting for a romantic date night. The menu has gotten an upgrade, though Chef says he's still deciding what stays and what goes. While you'll find traditional fare - alfredo, manicotti, ravioli - these all feature Marc's fresh made pasta and unrivaled Sunday sauce. He definitely has offerings for the more sophisticated - linguine Nero with squid ink pasta and artichoke hearts with a kick. I tried the linguine and clams and my date went with the veal parmesan which took up the entire plate for about half the price you'd find elsewhere. It was one of these \"there's no way I'm finishing this whole thing\" that turned into \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing, but it was so delicious and now I can't move.\" The service is, as expected, amazing, featuring some of the old Parma crew that made dining with them feel like being at home with a (functional) Italian family.   Chef Marc himself chatted with us a bit about the menu and we were enraptured by his descriptions of how he dreams up and executes each dish. The passion he exudes consumes you and, before I knew it, I was cheering him on as he described each step of his craft. \"Yeah, sauteed chanterelles, then what? Oh yeah, a little white wine and garlic? Fresh pasta? Hell YES.\"   While I'll miss the deli and the little retail store that unfailingly had my obscure Italian ingredients for my pathetically short-falling home cooking, I look forward to how this venture develops.   So glad Chef Marc is back!",

We went on a Sunday night and had reservations which I strongly recommend. While they provide chairs outside to wait for a table when it's 108 degrees outside even the awning   above the chairs wouldn't help. I've always enjoyed the pork chop El Chico which Mark tells me is his father's recipe. I order it as a 3 on a 1 --5 hotness scale which gives it a hot/spicy kick but you still know it's a pork chop. It was excellent. I'm not a fan of polenta so I requested a side of pasta which was tasty but the noodles were a little overcooked/soft for my taste.  My wife had the chicken marsala with mushrooms which she thought was excellent even the leftovers for lunch the next day.  The service was outstanding; very attentive without being overly obtrusive. We had a nice talk with Chef Mark reminiscing about the old place and it was good to see him again. We had a really good dinner and would definitely recommend Chef Mark's Trattoria except on nights we go as I don't want to wait for a table.",

His new menu has a lot of good options which makes the dish selection a lot easier. For our appetizer we got the  the escargot. The presentation of this dish was appealing. The escargot was taken out of the shell and placed on top of a crunchy garlicky toast. You get 8 escargots for $12, which is a reasonable price. I was very happy with the taste and flavors of this dish.   For my main entree I got the black pasta with shrimp scampi. The pasta was freshly made and the flavors were great. My only observation was the amount of olive oil in the bottom of the plate. Unfortunately, my pasta was swimming in a lot of oil which was not very appealing to me.   The service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive throughout the night. Chef Marc was very involved with his customers and all of his employees. So if you are craving some good pasta in the suburbs, this is a great local spot to try!",

Both dishes were fantastic! I had leftovers (which I made into a sandwich the following day). Portions were pretty big, but I don't eat a whole lot for dinner so it could just be me.   Service was excellent. The gentleman who sat us kept coming over to chit chat and our waitress was great with recommendations as well as keeping glasses filled with drinks.   The restaurant itself is pretty cute. It's not huge (from what I could see) but very well decorated and maintained.   I think it's a little on the pricey side, BUT it is worth it and not so expensive that it's cost prohibitive (more than Olive Garden, less than casino Italian).   Overall, I really liked Chef Marc's!!",

    "text": "In a word, sublime. We went here last night to celebrate Valentine's a day late.  The atmosphere is vaguely Goodfellas - you have faint 70s and 80s classics playing at just the right volume, the staff are all Italian or Italian-American and Chef Marc is making sure everyone is having 'a good time'.   The food was excellent. We had burrata as a starter (sidenote: the bread basket here is A+), then the lobster bisque (lady had italian wedding) and finally lamb ragu (lady had chicken picatta). In my opinion the noodles are where this place stands out. They are homemade, perfectly al dente and just the right thickness (lamb ragu was served over pappardelle). The ragu (bolognese) was creamy, but not too rich, and had a very nice depth of smoky flavor to it.   I wanted to deduct a star because the service was amiss at times - it seems they rotate all duties between the staff. This led to things like not receiving a spoon with our soups and having to wait to receive parmesan for my lamb ragu. But I didn't because the food was too good, the atmosphere too inviting and the waitstaff too friendly.  Will be back soon. Thanks Marc!",

    "text": "Incredibly disappointing!  Based on all the good reviews, I was hoping for a good-to-great experience, but it ended up being a mediocre-to-bad experience.   It started off poorly with the hostess saying I could sit at the bar but she held up a finger as she took a phone call. So I waited. After about 30 seconds, when it was clear that it wasn't going to be a quick phone call, I motioned walking to the bar and she just shrugged her shoulders. So I walked over to the bar area and sat down.   I waited for several moments and nobody came by. Eventually the hostess walked over and said my server would be with me soon. After another minute, a woman walks up and asks if I want water. I say yes and ask if she's my server, and she says no and leaves. Shortly, a guy walks up and asks if I want water. I say I already requested water and ask if he is my server. He says no, pours my water, and walks away. A little bit after that, another guy walks up and asks if I want to order a drink. I ask if he's my server, and he says yes. I ask if I can order food, and he acts surprised and says, \"but you just sat down!\" (I don't know why that matters, since I could already know what I want to order even if I had just sat down.) I explain that I've been waiting for a while and have had plenty of time to look through the menus.   I had originally wanted to try the tasting menu, but I happened to be in the area during happy hour, so I thought I'd try a few of their happy hour menu items. I ordered the happy hour versions of the Caesar salad, meatball, and ravioli of the day.   The food came out relatively quickly. The Caesar salad was watery and didn't taste like a Caesar salad at all. There was no flavor. The meatball was good. The ravioli had flavor, but was too salty.   Getting my check took a while too, as did getting change. I had to ask two different people for the check and three different people whether I was getting my change.   Factoring in the mediocre food and bad service in light of my expectations given the good Yelp reviews, I don't really have anything positive to say about this restaurant. Which is really too bad, because I was hoping I could find a new favorite Italian restaurant near my home.",

    "text": "I was to Chef Marc's Parma a couple of times and visited two of his pizza places.  After all closed, I was waiting to see what would happen.  Then I heard that he had opened a new trattoria in the Lakes which is fairly close to where I live.  I made a reservation and entered just before the reserved time at 5:15.  I was shown to a two top table around the wall from the entrance with a view of part of the restaurant.  In a short time, the waiter brought water, took my order for iced tea, and while this was going on, Chef Marc came to the table to greet me and to talk about the new place and then the specials for the night and he was talking up some of the dishes on the menu.  I ended up ordering the charred octopus to start.  It's served with white beans, celery, and lemon juice.  The octopus was nicely charred and the pieces were very plump and juicy.  In order to try both a pasta and a main course, my server, Donny, suggested the kitchen would make me a smaller portion of pasta.  I decided to get the small portion of wild mushroom ravioli with a truffle butter and parmesan cheese sauce.  The server added extra grated cheese.  The parmesan cream sauce was a perfect compliment to the ravioli and the smaller order was a generous portion but not enough to fill one up for the main course.  For the main, I ordered Scottish Salmon which was one of the two fish of the day selections.  The salmon had a coating of red and black pepper for a spicy taste and it was cooked perfectly.  Accompanying the salmon was a small amount of mashed potatoes and some glazed carrots.  I didn't think anyone served glazed carrots anymore but there they were.  While I would rather have had something else, they were OK and they gave a good counterpoint to the salmon's spicy topping.  For dessert, I got Italian style cheesecake and a double espresso.  Both were a good finish to a pleasant meal.  Service was excellent.  The staff was on everything immediately.  My only problem was with the sound.  The evening started with few customers and you could hear Sinatra singing.  Later, as more people came, the place got very loud from peoples' talk.  It just reverberated around the relatively small place.  I was glad they didn't turn up the music to try to make up for the loud talking.",

It's a cosy, probably family owned, neigbourhood restaurant. Where the chef greets you personnaly and explains the menu with passion. Too bad humans have just one stomach. It all sounded so good!   We've shared the cold meat and cheese appetizer which came with nice hot bread and some olive oil. Good appetizer. My husband had chicken, but I've forgotten which. Something with mushrooms. Perfect. Cooked to perfection.   My eggplant parmesan was a pleasant surprise. Very light and fresh. Served with some fusili. Only downside: no room for dessert.   Hope to come again soon.",

We ordered the organic fava bean salad, which came with blueberries and apples. The salad was so fresh that the staff literally sniped the bean sprouts from their own garden, and brought it to our table. We also shared the charred octopus and bone marrow scratched-made fusilli pasta, albeit it was not a original recipe (I believe the original creator of this dish is from Michael White's New York's Marea Italian restaurant), but it was tastiest and most stupendous pasta I've ever had! For my main entree, I ordered the traditional organic chicken Francese, and my husband ordered the Grouper special, both dishes were delicious!   Chef Marc came over to our table and chatted with us, and what an animated and amicable character he was.  Most of the staff there (including the bartender, our server, the male Asian expediter, and the host) were immensely warm and FRIENDLY! We are looking forward to a future visit again.",

The ambience is relatively informal ( no tablecloths but waiters in black vests and white shirts). Soon after we sat, our server, Antonette, came to our table to get our drink order and to explain some items on the menu. I decided to go with the eggplant parmesan. My wife ordered the chopped salad. The eggplant was a large portion. It was pretty good, not great. It came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce. The pasta was cooked al dante, the way I like it and the sauce was very good. My wife chopped salad was really mediocre. You expect a chopped salad in an Italian restaurant to be loaded with goodies. This one was mostly lettuce. It was also a fairly modest sized portion for the $11 price tag. I really wanted to like this restaurant more because the service was so good. Special kudos to Alicia, hour bus person. Perhaps if I lived in the neighborhood I would go back to try other menu items. But this is not a restaurant that I would travel to.",

    "text": "Update:  terrible response from the Chef.    We were really excited to try this place.  Upon entry the hostess was pleasant and sat us right away.  She did not fuss when we asked to move to the table next as we did not want to sit at the table nearest the door and main walking path.   It took about 3-4 minutes to be offered tap or bottled water.  We close sparkling.   I found it odd that my 4 year old was poured almost double the amount my husband was.  No big deal, we share as a family and have no issues ordering more when needed. The male who served our water had no problem answering some questions we had about appetizers we saw on yelp but not on our menu (fried calamari and fried mozzarella).  I was surprised he wasn't our server as he was pleasant, helpful and seemed knowledgeable.  We ordered the appetizer escargot with him and then were immediately greeted by our server.   She was nice.  We placed our dinner order right away. My daughter ordered the Caesar salad, it was a medium sized portion, fresh with good flavor in the cheese and dressing. My son had a simple pasta in a butter/cheese sauce.  It was tasteful and cooked al dente. I had the wild shrimp scampi.  It was excellent. My husband ordered the Cioppino (seafood platter).  This comes with spaghettini.  The pasta seemed to have been al dente before being tossed in the sauce and was quite more.. chewy than my perfectly cooked spaghettini in the shrimp scampi.  My husband is not one to send food back but after I took a bite to confirm his suggestion our server came over.  I let her know it was slightly over cooked, my husband agreed and asked for a new batch.  Our server took the bowl and seemed like it was no problem. Here's where I deduct stars. Server returns and says the chef suggests it is not over cooked and places the same dish of pasta on the table.   At the same time another employee comes over with \"a key ingredient to the Cioppino\" in a small dish.   The crab.   He asks my husband if he'd just like it poured on his plate.  He agreed and we finished our meal but with a bad taste in our mouths about this situation. This was just 2 negative things that will make us not return because at least 1 of these could've been avoided.  Not to mention the chef did not come out to make sure the dish was satisfactory even after missing a key ingredient and asking for a new batch of spaghettini.  (I say this because in a lot of reviews the diners express their table visits by Chef Marc.)  I originally was looking forward to trying some desserts here but couldn't stand giving my business any further to an establishment that made me feel unappreciated.  That's too bad because again, the shrimp scampi and escargot were delicious.",

When the Trattoria opened we were ecstatic and love it even more than we loved Parma.  The food is superb...just out of this world!  Every single meal we have had there (and there have been many) has been off the charts!    The fresh pasta is amazing, a personal favorite, and all of the meat dishes are amazing!  The service is amazing as well.  We love that we have a place to actually DINE.  We love the relaxing atmosphere and every staff member treats you like family.  Chef Marc routinely comes out of the kitchen and touches tables.  When you talk to him, his passion for food and his craft is obvious.  From the moment you enter the restaurant and Lucio (the Matre'd) greets you, you feel at home.  Most of the time Irina or Tracey have been our server and they take care of you as if you were family!  To end the meal, Nadia's desserts are amazing!  We always leave stuffed and happy!  5 stars all the way!",

We wanted to thank Chef Marc and his incredible staff for making our Las Vegas reception absolutely memorable- people are still talking about how this was the BEST food they've ever had at a reception.  In the weeks leading up to the reception, Chef Marc put together the delicious tasting menu.  We, as newlyweds, had a tall order as our guests ranged from vegan to the die-hard meat lover.   He created a selection that was out of this world.  Then he continued to add and add to the plate choices.    We had over 80 guests and everyone fit nicely.  Lino made sure of that.  He took our thoughts and turned them into a reality that filled every spot in the restaurant without making everyone squished in .  The flavors, the choices, the ambiance, the love that went into our day from Chef Marc and his restaurant family is what we cherish and are so thankful for.  Almost seven months later...this review is still relevant and fully deserved!  If you have an important event, trust Chef Marc and the crew to take your vision as their own.   Thank You and Many Blessings!!!",

Once again the food and Chef Marc exceeded expectations. We wanted our pastas extra spicy so Chef Marc added some Carolina Reaper pepper into our sauce. Oh my god it was good. I was still feeling the burn the next day. We asked for it and he delivered. The chicken riggies and the black linguine dishes both tasted delicious or as delicious as our numbed tongues could taste. Throw in some good escargot and pasta fagioli and you got a winner of a meal.   However, once again the management side of our experiences rubbed us the wrong way. We found out afterwards that there was a Happy Hour while we were there. There was literally nobody there so it's not like they were so busy that they couldn't mention it to us. We could have easily moved to the bar or patio or wherever necessary to experience the Happy Hour if we knew about it. We ordered two wines and appetizers, presumably double priced as compared to the discounted menu. This type of service is very poor, and when directly counter to the great meals and cookery from Chef Marc, it's really weird. I'm not sure if it's the back of house problem or what, but come to Chef Marc's expecting great food locally, that's it. Twice now something has happened that would make me avoid going back to a restaurant. As good as the food is I'm not sure I'll come back here.",

    "text": "Had a fantastic meal at Chef Marc's - really fits my personal perception of what an  Italian restaurant is all about.  The food was excellent, and was real classic Italian, and not watered-down like many places tend to be. The ambience was perfect, the lighting, music (think Sinatra was on when we walked in) and service was all impeccable.  I had the Short Rib Malfatti (because I saw it in a Yelp picture) and it was just as good as I was hoping it'd be.  Tons of short rib, and the pasta was cooked just right.  I inhaled the entire thing even though it was a very dense meal.  My wife had the Wild Shrimp Scampi, but I didn't get to try it because we were fighting, and didn't think it prudent to ask for a bite.    We had to go catch a show so couldn't stay for dessert, but we'll definitely be back, and with time to spare.  Special shout-out to Sam who is exactly the type of employee that every Italian restaurant NEEDS.  He helped us navigate the menu, and made sure we were taken care of throughout the course of the meal.  Molto Bene!",

    "text": "I don't write a lot of reviews, and when I do, they're usually to highlight how BAD a place was.  Well, I'm writing this review to emphasize how much my wife and I enjoyed Chef Marc's Trattoria.    For starters, my wife and I shared a Caesar salad and a dish of escargot.  Both dishes were excellent, and the Caesar, made with a classic house dressing made using organic egg yolk & crushed anchovies were the best I've enjoyed in some time.  The escargot, also delicious, was served with a garlic butter & white wine sauce with just the right touch of lemon, and with a side of mini-toasts.  For our main courses we enjoyed (and shared, they were soooo good) Chef Marc's Linguini Nero, which is a delicious concoction of black linguini, Rhode Island calamari, wild shrimp, hot chili peppers and a light Pomodoro that brought out the flavors.  Our second entree was one of the specials of the evening - a New York Strip - cooked to perfection.  I have eaten a lot of steak in many excellent restaurants, but I have to tell you, and I mean this with all seriousness, this was the best steak I have EVER eaten.  Finally, to finish the evening, we enjoyed Chef Marc's Rum Cake with espressos, and yes, they were delicious as well.  The Rum Cake was just the right amount of moist and sweet and with a nice frosted edge.   Overall we just loved the food, and Chef Marc was a pleasure to speak with and very outgoing.  He did a great job of explaining plates and took the time to stop at each table to greet his guests.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.",

A great date spot, small and intimate where the owner (Chef Marc) is on scene and makes sure your meal is perfect. If you're lucky enough to get Tracy as your server, that will be the cherry on top. After many times of dining there, we have never been disappointed.  A great Happy Hour menu is also available. We had the Happy Hour meatballs last night and they were fabulous. For dessert, try the in-house made rum cake. You won't be disappointed.",

Chef Marc <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ihatchchile.com%2Fin%2Fnevada%2F&s=1815d846adfd9863d5b6dadd71f748d30c901f866b93bb9fe906e673b288177b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ihatchchile.com/in/nevada</a> talked to us about what they do and how they prepare his food. The rest of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They made smaller portions for our kids as well. This is BY FAR the best restaurant I've eaten in in Las Vegas. Do yourself a favor and go check it out for yourself. The rib eye steak was amazing as well as the dark chocolate gelato.",

The chef came to our table twice throughout the night. He was so personable & friendly. Our server was wonderful. We had a delicious bottle of wine. The bread basket was great. They had a special butternut squash ravioli for an appetizer and so of course we ordered one for our table. All 3 of us loved our entrees. Shared a cannoli for dessert and it was lovely; although I was stuffed and couldn't hardly eat another bite. It was just delicious. Great atmosphere. Hidden location, hard to find but so worth it when you do. Meal wasn't cheap. But you get what you pay for and we sure loved every bite!",

I had the chicken scarpiello which I could  have had spicy up from level 1 to 5.  I love spicy so I chose 5.  It was a chicken dish that came over polenta with hot Italian sausage.  It was one of the best dishes I have ever had.  Chef Marc came over to say hello and knew I had ordered it hot and brought over a pepper (south carolina something) and offered it to me.  Told me to be careful, and he was right, it was really hot and I loved it.  The service was very good, the ambiance was casual and enjoyable and the food was outstanding.  Marc was a good host.  Go there, you will love it........",

We've had most everything from the menu at least once and neither of us has had a complaint.  We took the in-laws there the other night and they were also quite impressed with the food.  Ambiance is fine dining but Chef Marc is very friendly and escapes the kitchen frequently to visit all of his guests.  On our latest visit, I got the Amatriciana pasta and the pasta was fresh and homemade plus it was cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce was flavorful and had a bit of a bite, just enough to not overwhelm the taste buds.  Hubby got the Gnocchi with a pesto sauce and he devoured every bite, except the two gnocchis I barely managed to steal from him. They were fantastic, fresh little pillows of delight.  In-laws got the Lasagna (deconstructed) and Amatriciana, both loved their meals.  We'll definitely be back!",

We've lived in Las Vegas for 12 years and can easily say that after eating dinner at this restaurant we have been robbing ourselves of the best food in town for 12 solid years. It was amazing. This is a small hidden gem on Sharra Blvd. I ordered the veal parmesan because I have always felt it is a True test of a good Italian restaurant. It was divine.... high praise words I know and maybe you are saying really???? YES IT WAS THAT GOOD. My wife had the broken lasagna.... which I had to give Chef Marc credit for as the most amazing dish put on a plate.  I have waited to write this review for a little while as I wondered if it was the night, the moment, or I just really wanted it to be that good..... in retrospect it was that good!!! Do not miss this place If you want Italian food.... it is better and less expensive than a trip to the country itself..... it is love on a plate!!! That was my conclusion, Chef Marc loves what he is doing, it shows in everything that comes out of his kitchen, and he is a master of the craft! Or he has twelve Italian grandmothers chained in the kitchen!!! Either way, well worth the visit don't pass it up!",

Before ordering, Chef Marc greeted us and beautifully described each dish on the menu, off the menu and said he was ok with special requests if needed.  There were eight people in our party. Everyone ordered something different. I started with gazpacho, which was off the charts. My husband had the pasta fagioli. Another home run.  For dinner I ordered shrimp fra diavolo and got to choose how hot I wanted the dish. I have ordered this dish all over the country, and without a doubt, Chef Marc's was the best I ever had. The shrimp were so big, tender and tasty. It felt like they melted in my mouth. The sauce had the perfect amount of spice and the pasta was freshly made that day.   My husband had the veal dish which he absolutely loved. My mother ordered the rigatoni. She's an extremely picky eater yet loved the dish so much she wants to come back and get it again. Our friend ordered the short rib lasagna. It was devoured!  Throughout our dinner chef Marc stopped by the table to talk to us. He made our dinner experience wonderfully personalized, which made us feel like we were the only table in the room.   The wait staff worked like a well oiled machine. We never had an empty glass of water or wine, yet it felt like they didn't exist. Incredible delivery!   Great job, Chef Marc and staff. You're doing everything right. This wasn't just a dinner at a nice restaurant. This was nothing short of a symphony!",

First of all, online stated they opened at 4:30 when they didn't open until 5pm. Then when we walked in and stated we wanted to sit in a section for happy hour, we were seated at a regular table and were told we could order happy hour specials. The waiter then arrived and said that was not True and that we would have to sit at he bar. Luckily there were 4 spots at the bar.  The meatball was good but probably overpriced, charcuterie board 2/5 was very simple and not worth it, but the ravioli was a 5/5. We were also charged regular price for the happy hour wine which we had to have corrected. Overall, the service was disappointing. I would still recommend coming for the regular menu entrees but don't expect anything from the happy hour.",

    "text": "How we all prefer a terrific meal in a lovely setting; a meal from a unique menu of many choices; a fine wine list, and an owner-chef with credentials.  But still, is this enough?  I called the trattoria for 6:30 reservations for yesterday & mentioned it was our first time, and a birthday celebration (I also informed the maitre'd when we arrived).  We were greeted by a 3 year old child running about the restaurant, climbing over empty chairs & booth.  She would have continued past the 20 mins. but I asked a server to provide a high chair for her.  That lasted only a few mins. because she cried & screamed to get out.  F I n a l l y!  A server took the little girl away.  I ordered the Chicken Picatta and my partner the Scarpariello (roasted organic chicken with Italian sausage, served on pasta or polenta (as menu stated).  There were 2 kinds of bread served:  pizza-like bruschetta & parmesan toast.  Both were very good.  Our server spoke Italian & was very attentive, asking how spicy he wanted the Scarpariello & saying it was a large serving.  And indeed it was!   A half organic chicken with sweet red peppers & 2 nice-sized Ital. sausages cooked just right.  It all sat on a bed of spiced pasta.  My Chicken Picatta with lemon & capers was organically perfect!  It not only melted in my mouth, but I (reluctantly) had to leave one of the 3 portions for the next day's dinner.  It was served with a fresh tomato pasta & a side of mundane carrots (not a good side with that pasta).  The ambiance was bright to the outside & seating arranged well.  I would prefer candles on the table, and don't understand the lack of music.  This is an Italian restaurant after all, & we'd have loved the sound of jazz or classical or Bocelli to drown out conversations around us.  Perhaps Marc prefers the atmosphere to be like his previous Bohemian casual restaurant/deli on Lake Mead, but I'd \"upgrade\" in this setting in The Lakes.  I also wish he had a house wine for $5-6.00 and not those starting at $10.00.  All-in-all, it needs some tweaking; and maybe he just needs more time.  P.S.  I really wanted people to join in while I sang Happy Birthday, but not even a cupcake arrived.  (I took my partner out for Tiramisu).",

    "text": "Truly one of the best dining experiences we have had in Vegas (and it's this way every time we go!).   We just left such an incredible meal there that it compelled me to lay in bed and Yelp about it.  Our daughter's birthday happens to be on Valentine's Day, making it near impossible to go out for a decent meal. Since it was her first birthday, we wanted to treat our family to a night out and Chef Marc did not disappoint. We spoke to him ahead of time and he was happy to work on a menu with us for our group-- even on Valentine's Day, the day pre fix menus go to die.  Every bite of food was incredible, but nothing compares to his pork chops. We go out to eat and cook a lot and it's still the best pork I've ever eaten.  This place is gem and if you haven't been before, run there don't walk!",

It is worth the trip off the strip if you are a visitor or a local living on the other side of town. Always farm fresh produce and they cure their own meats and make all pasta in house! Every time I'm here I feel like I'm tasting italy.",

When I asked where she wanted to go and she told me to chose I immediately thought of this place which I had been wanting to try.  I have followed Chef Marc from his first Las Vegas restaurant on Lake Mead and Tenaya to Mezzo, then Parma and now here.  This menu is larger and there are  lot of new items on the menu but some of the old favorites are still there.  First we shared a Buratta Salad and our waitress asked if we wanted heirloom tomatoes added which I thought was very nice touch.  It was incredibly delicious.  My friend had Veal Picatta and she said it was better than some of the Italian food she had recently had on her trip to Italy.  I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and when I was ordering the waitress asked how hot I wanted it on a scale from 1-5.  I ordered a three but didn't find it hot at all.  It was very good however I found some of the shrimp to be overcooked.I have to say that it was quite noisy but the food was still as good as ever.  I would definitely come back here.",

    "text": "As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas, I always knew that the best food was made by locals off the strip. On this trip my wife and I decided it would be a great idea to try a nice local place that would be a truly unique dining experience. After doing some research we found out about Chef Marc's Trattoria located in West Las Vegas. In all my journeys to the city of slots, I had never traveled too far off the strip. Once we got in the taxi we started heading west, and the further we drove the further I wondered if we made the right decision. Once we arrived however, we were met by the friendly greeter who seated us where ever we desired. We immediately felt at home, and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Appetizers: Charred octopus:  Soft and zesty, served with white bean. Escargot: Prepared with a magnificent truffle butter garlic over crostini Eggplant Parmesan (without pasta) nicely layered, traditional. Very authentic.  Main Dish: Papperdelle Bolognese: Also very traditional. Chef Marc was so nice, he greeted us at our table and spoke with us a few moments. He mentioned that this was the first dish he learned to make and that he learned it Tuscany. It truly felt like a taste of Italy. The pasta is light and buttery, the sauce savory with soft sweet notes of the carrots. The flavors were so harmonious, we didnt want it to end. Veil Chop  (bone in) served over a creamy risotto. Hands down, the best veil Ive ever had. Very fresh, it fell off the bone. Very well marinated with garlic.  Dessert: Tiramisu: soft and creamy, with a sambuca it was the most proper digestif.  My next trip to Las Vegas will be centered around a vist to Chef Marc's Trattoria, a fine and exemplary dining experience.",

Is there anything Chef Marc does that isn't absolutely fantastic?? This is no exception.

After telling him I wanted lots of veggies, but not mushrooms, and some chicken for protein he made the most AMAZING dish ever. I'm not sure what it was, but it had a ton of vegetables, spinach pasta and chicken. Best meal I've had in a really long time!!!   We've been here at least once every 7-10 days since we first came. We  this place, Chef Marc and his awesome staff!!! I am out of adjectives to explain how amazing the food is... Tonight my BF said his pork chop was the \"the best I've ever had\"!!!
