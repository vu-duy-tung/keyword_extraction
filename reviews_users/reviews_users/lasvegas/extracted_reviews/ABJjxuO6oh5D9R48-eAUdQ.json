I still don't get the two stars.  Don't go to a buffet expecting a 5 star restaurant.. and you won't be disappointed.   Buffets are buffets. A smorgasbord of different types of foods and drinks to meet any desires and requests..  The girlfriend and I came to the Luxor with yet another of the MLife coupon's we had earned on their facebook game MyVegas. 2 for 1 this time.  The Luxor and the Excalibur buffets are essentially the same thing. Different set up but we did take the chance to try it all. Sweets, waffles, omelets (which had just too much stuff to choose from), and even the middle Eastern sampling of baba ghnoush and tabbouleh with naan and pita bread.  It wasn't anything to write home about.. but it certainly wasn't two stars bad either.",

This place is very basic and the food is in taste as much as buffet food can be. But I must add that the wife was very pleased and impressed with the dessert portion of the buffet. Something the mandalay buffet did not have. But I would rather spend the 4 bucks extra a person and go to mandalay.",

    "text": "I don't know what the big deal is. This buffet is GOOD. Aside from a few low quality foods, the foods I got were great tasting. Since I'm a pasta fanatic, I got everything pasta along with oysters and dessert. The pesto was DELICIOUS and tasted like a quality Italian restaraunt dish (though not sure if you would deem it as 'authentic'). The Asian food was a little off, but hey, the other foods measured up. The oysters were also good and flavorful. Lastly, the dessert was simply great. I strongly recommend diners to try the caramel flan; it was so perfectly made! I applaud whoever made it.   Two complaints that caused it a star: - For the price, the presentation could've been way better. If not for the pharaoh decor it could've passed as a golden corral.  - Servers would only pick up our plates, did not give us new utensils like most other buffets do. Even so, new utensils weren't provided so we had to reuse our utensils or flag down servers (which was not easy)   If I hadn't done the timeshare and had to pay full price ($88 for my whole family) Another star probably would've been knocked off. Instead, I only had to pay $43 and for $43 this buffet is pretty nice. 2 thumbs up!",

But in all honesty, the food selection is not bad, the service is really courteous, not too much I can complain about. However, our choice to eat here was of mere convenience and no more than that. If we weren't staying at the Luxor, I highly doubt we would have chosen this buffet to eat at. They would seriously need to up their game to compete against the other buffets along the strip, but considering it still survives means that they must offer something people still come for.",

On the food side, the Saturday brunch was good. The omelette station had a long line and so I did not wait. The selection of salads abd breakfast items would please most tastes, however, the best part is that they have gluten free cakes, including carrot cake, lemon poppy seed, etc. And they have no sugar added pies, and sugar free desserts. Non fat yogurt too. The coffee is tasty and the tea is decent. I like that you serve yourself with drinks and they have multiple stations for self serving drinks so there is never a line.",

    "text": "Had dinner here a few weeks ago and if I had based the idea of eating here upon the reviews I probably would not have done so. Luckily, I was not paying for the meal so we decided to give it a go! And we were very pleasantly surprised I am happy to report.  There are a bunch of different stations based on cuisine- so there was an Asian food area, a Mexican food area, etc.   Tried:   Ginger Soy Chicken - Decent. Good taste, okay chicken.  Fried Rice - Also not bad. Not outstanding, but decent enough to get a couple servings. :)  Pizza - Surprisingly delicious! Reminded me of our favourite pizza joint here in Southern California. A good crust (crunchy outside, soft inside- good bread-to-topping ratio), good tomato sauce and cheese. I tried the cheese pizza, FYI.  Meat Balls - Probably a tie for my affection between the pizza and meat balls. So good! Tender, juicy, and flavourful.  I also tried ham from the carvery station which was not bad.  Biggest surprise was the tamales. Who knew the Luxor buffet would have such a beautiful and rare Mexican gem such as tamales? These were also surprisingly good and tasted pretty authentic.  Drinks I saw were sodas, coffee, and juices (orange, apple, etc.).  There is also a decent dessert selection with all sorts including cheesecake and small chocolate dishes.   Knocked a star off for the price. Definitely enjoyed the buffet, but would not pay $23 for it. Depends on how much one can eat, I guess.  4 stars based upon my surprise at how good the buffet turned out to be. I felt compelled to write a review to give this poor buffet some positive publicity. I think enjoyment of the buffet might have a lot to do with expectations; if you're looking for a Bellagio calibre buffet you will probably be disappointed.  Come with realistic expectations and try different items and you should find some gems. :)",

Eating is a passion of ours, and we like to try out different places to see what they have to offer. On a 1-10 scale I give this place a 5. Everything was mediocre at best, and pretty tasteless and cold. As other reviews had mentioned a lot of dishes were listed but they weren't physically there. My boyfriend figured out that if you add a crap load of ketchup though it really adds some flavor. The dessert however was pretty good. I'm not sure I would recommend this place to others as I was not impressed with the pink chicken that I was served. I ended up going back to the buffet tables 4 times just because I only liked about 4 bites worth on each plate. Maybe It was first timers luck?",

The food is fresh and the people are friendly. I'm not an exotic foodie so this place is A-OK by me. It's pricey for just coming in for one meal; but they have a $35 all day pass that would get you into here and the Excalibur buffet as many times as you want all day - if you are staying in the vicinity all day it's a good bargain to prepay for all of your meals.

I was a bit surprised that I had to pay adult price for my 12 year old when most start charging more when they turn 13.  The buffet was very clean and spacious.  They had an array of food selections.  Not only did they split the crab legs, they cleaned and peeled the shrimp!  All the food tasted great.  You have to get your own drinks which I didn't like because ultimately other than plate removal, there is no service thus a minimal tip for the employees.  The desserts were fabulous!

It had the usual Vegas buffet staples of salad, fruit, aisian, desserts, ice cream, etc.  I didn't have anything that I fell in love with, yet I didn't have anything that I brought to the table that I didn't eat either.   My buffet was complimentary with my room so I didn't pay and it was satisfying for the 'price,' yet if you want a great buffet, I would suggest going elsewhere (Rio and Ceaser's are at the top of my list).",

Luckily I got the all day pass that was also good at Excalibur, otherwise it all would have been a waste.  Literally nothing was good here, and while it LOOKS big on the outside, the selection is awful.  There is a large salad bar though, but salads aren't really my thing...  The meat selection sucks.

We noticed the reviews on all websites weren't the greatest, but we aren't that picky with our food and thought we'd give it a shot.  While there was a TON of food to choose from, there were only about two things that would be deemed as \"good\".  Not only were the eggs runny, but even the chocolate milk was watery!",

The lines can start getting long around 9 am but if you arrive early enough, before 8:30 am, you can beat the rush.   GOOD: The scrambled eggs and Spanish omelets were both good. The breakfast meats were also good, consisting of bacon, sausage links and sausage patties. They have real sliced home fried potatoes. Cheese blintzes were a bonus. Apple crepes were ok. I also like the self serve juice bar and coffee. It beats waiting on a server to bring you your beverage and hope they got it right. Biscuits and gravy were good one day, bad the next.  BAD: One day the biscuits were fresh, the next day they were hard as a rock. Even gravy could not save them. They placed breakfast meats in line just before the omelet station. People waiting in line for omelets to be made end up blocking the breakfast meats in. They really need to redesign the buffet line food placement to avoid this.  For the price, breakfast here can't be beat. This will be our regular breakfast stop.",

If you want GOOD quality, try Bayside Buffet in Mandalay Bay.  This food was bland, sad and not very tasty.

    "text": "The Buffet at the Luxor seems to be slightly lesser known than some of the other Buffet's that people tend to talk about or recommend.  But in my opinion is one of the better Buffet's as far as price, quality and wait time's in Vegas.  Buffet's are getting outrageously expensive in Vegas if you go to any of the more popular or highly rated ones on the strip.  You can easily pay upwards of $50 per person for a Dinner Buffet at some hotels or for the Seafood themed nights and wait an hour plus to pay these high prices.  Don't get me wrong, the food is normally very good, a lot of variety and quality seems high.  But paying $200+ for dinner for a family of four is not my idea of money well spent.  The Buffet at the Luxor has pretty much the same variety as most Buffets, the wait time when I have gone has never been more than 15 minutes and the price per person for dinner is only $24.99 each.  $16.99 for kids under 12 I believe. The have a great selection of salads with plenty of toppings, they have a carving station, Chinese, American, Mexican and Italian stations normally.  You can have made to order items from the Chef's, etc.  They also have an offering of seafood selections, I usually always have crab legs which are my favorite.  I have only been here once when they did not have them.  If you don't see them in the main sections of the Buffet, go to the areas where the Chef's are and they are sometimes serving them from there.  Of course they have a ton of desert options as well for you sweet tooth.  All in all if you are looking to have a Buffet experience that will not break the bank, I would recommend The Buffet at the Luxor.  Less than $100 for a family of four and you can eat until you need to be rolled out of there.    If you are part of Mlife or play My Vegas you can also get great discounts for free Buffet's or 2-1 Buffet's as well or even Free Buffets, even better.  One last plus that I have to mention, which is high on my list and I should have lead this Buffet is actually below the casino floor so the smoke levels are minimal (I really hate smoking and don't want to smell it while I am eating). This is great!!  Updated on 5/16/18  Came back for another visit while I was here in Vegas, I have to say, this time around not quite as good as previous times I had been here.  My review above still stands although I dropped the rating from a 5 to a 4 this time.  Still overall decent and priced right, but some of the options this time were limited and they did not have any kind of crab legs this go around (warm or cold) a little of a disappointment.  The roast beef was a little tough at the carving station, but the rest of the food was good.    Another thing I did not mention in my first review is that they have a full bar where you can get  beer, wine or various mixed drinks.  They charge for the drinks unless you pay for an unlimited all you can drink pass.  Still a nice addition to their buffet.  One last thing is all MGM properties charge for parking, unless you are a gold member or above  from their Mlife loyalty program.  Just something to consider when looking for a buffet in Vegas these days)  Enjoy.",

When my husband came back from getting his food, he saw left-over liquid SPILLED all over his seat. He asked her to change our seatings. She said NO, and said that she would only clean it for him. She also asked him \"Did you do this?\". When she asked us about the finished plates, this was how she asked \"IS THIS FINISHED?\" (with an attitude) without saying Please as she did to the other tables ( customers are white)... Speechless!   Then she basically did not take our finished plates on the tables from that point. There were two plates on the table and she did not even touch them. Other Asian customers on the opposite table also had the same treatment.   I wish I can post her picture here. I took a picture of her, our table and the other table as mentioned above.   The food is too salty. I will never come back to Luxor The Buffet. This is the worse customer service and food I have ever had from a buffet this price range.

After making my first round, I realized that this was very different from the classy, glamorous buffet that you would expect at an upscale resort. Some of the food was cold and hard. We felt sick when we left. I wouldn't say that there was something wrong with the food, but the quality was not there. The only saving grace was the mini flan they had for dessert.  It would be an understatement to say that I was disappointed. Not a place where you would come back for \"more\".",

All the food has been sitting out for a long time. The corn was soggy, the ribs were dried out. The waffle fries were hard as rock. The fried chicken was saturated in grease. I brought four plates of food back from the buffet and couldn't even eat 15%.   There was literally no bread out. The three baskets were completely empty, except for two rock hard pieces of sourdough. There was bread on the floor.  My boyfriend asked if there would be more bread put out. 20 min later I had to go track down the same worker and ask again.   The desert bar was no better. I had to scrape the top layer of the cheese cake off in order to eat it.   The lemon pannacotta had a strong metallic taste.  Never in my life have I left a buffet hungrier than when I arrived.   Granted, we only paid $27.05 for two people.  If I did not have a BOGO coupon I would have asked for my money back.   \"It's sad that I had to make a sandwich from the buffet because I'm still so hungry, I couldn't eat any of that crap\" - my poor boyfriend.",

(You can catch a tram over to Mandalay Bay, which has more restaurants and a food court. But meh, lazy.)  They also have a deal running where you can eat at the Excalibur buffet as well as the Luxor one for a flat rate all day.  If I had kids or was on vacation I would definitely take advantage of that deal.   Food is your typical hotel fare, which means a carving station and crab legs and a selection of different international cuisines. Nothing like the Wynn, but for $24 per person I was very satisfied. Not to mention very full.   They also have a full bar in the area, as well as a soft-serve ice cream machine and froyo machine. Bonus points!",

No real service to speak of since it is a buffet and we had minimal contact other than being taken to our table.   No welcome, no explanation of their different areas of food represented. I get it is Vegas, but not everyone is a return visitor. You have people visiting from all over the world and asking if you've been here before and if they say no, then give a quick run down. I truly feel if they had greeters engage more with quests and give a brief run down of the food variety that is available.  Again food isn't bad but they are a little pricey for the bland food with no customer service.  It was clean and there is lots of seating.",

It's surprising to find such a satisfying buffet with a great selection of breakfast items at the Luxor, which is a casino I'm not a big fan of. I'm a fan of their breakfast buffet though!  You'll find everything from French toast to cheese blintzes, from turkey sausages to pork sausages, from croissants to bagels, from breakfast burritos to biscuits and gravy--almost anything you can crave for breakfast. I played it safe with toast, cottage cheese topped with strawberry compote from the pancake/waffle section, turkey sausages, blueberry muffins (very moist!), scrambled eggs, and oatmeal.... it was all delicious. My family loved their corned beef hash, eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs with chorizo, and French toast. I think that pretty much confirms that everything here tastes great. My only complaint is that the fresh fruit selection is lacking. I swear, if they added some fresh berries and fresh pineapple instead of the canned ones they serve this buffet would be the best breakfast buffet! As a fruit lover, this is why I'm giving the buffet four stars instead of five.   The service was also friendly. Our servers always wore a big smile on their faces and welcomed us warmly on the second day we dined there.   I'm not sure how the lunch or dinner buffet at the Luxor is, but I'll be returning for the breakfast buffet even if I'm staying at another hotel. To me, it's worth the travel and the reasonable $17.99 price.",

This business is an prime example of quantity over quality. While under $20 per person for lunch seems like a bargain, it is not. I know why this place was empty. This place is depressing and the food was terrible.   The burger station serves hockey pucks for patties. The pizza is barely edible. I picked up some sushi and the salmon pieces were so thin. Scary looking... here's a little more imagery: old pasta (it was sitting there for a while... you know when it turns to a darker shade of yellow?). BBQ ribs were dry (wait I didn't ask for beef jerky). Prime Rib had plenty of grizzle... grizzle rib? Is this turning you on? It shouldn't.  I wish I invested the buffet fees into a slot machine and went to McDonald's.  I will not return.   IFHTP 1",

Well it's $22/pp, when I was told that I had to get my own drinks that was my first thought of THIS SUCKS!!!  As I started going through the food area I was sooooooo disappointed - I AM IN VEGAS ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  The food was so so, not very happy with the types of food and/or the taste of the food.  No wonder they gave me a free comp to this place.  Do yourself a favor - do not, I repeat - DO NOT waste your money.",

Dessert looks like it was pulled out of a box and placed on a stand.  Sushi was still frozen.  Put it this way, I did not get any item from the buffet line more than once.  They messed up steamed rice.  wtf?  In case you are wondering how, there were so many hard uncooked rice morsels on my plate.  Save your money and eat elsewhere.    If you're wondering why I would even eat at a buffet like this after experiencing places like the bellagio or wynn buffet, it is because I was forced to purchase the all-inclusive package for the group I was with.  Which is worth it if you actually want to participate in all the stuff they offer, but who really does that while they are in vegas?",

After all, we are in Vegas, and we want to eat the best food available.  But we had to go.  22 Dollars a plate for  a Buffet in Vegas!  It doesn't get cheaper than that around this area.   The Service: It's a buffet, so its self served.  However, the staff is very quick to pick up the plates.  Also, the restaurant was very clean! The Restaurant: It looks like a giant elegant school cafeteria. The food: Obviously it won't compare with a 5 star acclaimed restaurant, but it's also not even 1/4 of the price.  However, its much better than the average country style buffet.  I actually enjoyed allot of the dished better than even food from chain restaurants such as apple bees, etc.. If you're looking to enjoy the best fine dining experience, then don't  go there.  If all you want is reasonable good food, then this is the place to go.  And let me tell you about deserts,  YUM...",

When I made it over to the buffet it became apparent why they make you pay before you get into the restaurant. The \"hot\" meats were dry and only barely warm. The cold items were not really. If you eat seafood from this buffet, you are more brave than I am. After trying a several different things, including the taco chicken, and pizza (because how can you mess that up) I decided that the items on the buffet were all upsettingly distasteful and I would just eat salad. They had an olive salad (i love olives), tomato salad (also love tomato salad) and spinach salad. The Olive Salad actually tasted like garbage smells. The Tomato salad was not much better. The best things on the buffet were actually the enchiladas which tasted like they came from the freezer section at a shady grocery store. With all of the other choices around for food, pass on this one.",

They have SO MANY options that I think anyone could find something tasty.  I liked the salads, and the Mexican/Greek sections were good.  The Asian section had veggie eggrolls, but they seemed to be mostly cabbage inside.  The fried rice was comparable to Panda Express etc.  I didn't eat American or Italian.  They had 3 kinds of soup (one unlabeled, two chicken noodle, one egg drop).  The dessert is great (10-15 types including flan, cheesecakes, creme brulee, danishes, soft serve, mousse, bread pudding...).  My biggest complaint is that half of the foods are mislabeled or unlabeled.  Most of the time this just meant that the beef said \"chicken\" and the chicken said \"beef\", and they were right next to each other.  I remember one of the soups wasn't labeled (and unidentifiable), and crepes were called \"monkey bread\".  Also, they had little blintzes labeled \"eggs benedict\".  If you have allergies, I would be worried about eating here, because of the lack of naming-finesse.  Oh also, every single line is different (i.e., they DON'T have two identical salad lines), so make sure you look everywhere for food.",

The food was pretty decent but nothing on top grade when comparing the different buffets you can choose on the LV Strip.   The Cinnamon Monkey Bread was something of a different nature that gave this place some uniqueness. The unlimited mimosas is one you can't go wrong. The waitress who served the drinks was funny as hell but could taken the wrong way when joking about the champagne costing only $3 a bottle.   Anyways, not a bad place overall but you have better choices if you go to other places raved about. The buffet at the M hotel is what I hear is the place to go lately!",

The Mexican Food only had a few of the same type of dishes. Get this, no beans either.    Overall the service was good. Laura took very great care of our table and area. Her lead wasn't pleasant with her, that wasn't cool, but she smiled and carried on. Never let us know she was bothered.   For $29 bucks or so, I left full and satisfied.

The fried rice was average (hard to meds it up), the white rice was mushy, the egg roll was average and the pot sticker was overcooked, dry and tough.

It was often over cooked, lacking in flavor, soaking wet with god knows what. The only upside, was the crab legs, shrimp, and sushi.   All three were very well done, considering how basic of a fare they were. Breakfast was... Iffy at best, not any better than dinner. In fact, it was a little worse.   The dessert though, oh my goodness. The main event in this buffet, is the absolutely wonderful dessert.",

You have to tip before you get in and your options start at 18 percent with no waiter.  You get your own coffee and everything,, only thing they do is clear the plates. Do yourself a favor and go to Mandalay Bay buffet, it is cheaper and much more selection of a much higher quality product. Unfortunately I have to give it a star.   So one it is.",

I called the buffet a few weeks in advance to my visit to double check if they still carried turkey breakfast sausage as I don't eat beef and pork for health purposes. CHEF THEO was very friendly and helpful over the phone and advised me to call back a couple days before my visit to make extra sure they would carry it that day. So I followed his instructions. Although the day I was going to visit so happened to be his day off he still kept his word and alerted another cook of my special request. Sure enough when I arrived all I had to tell them was my name and my delicious turkey sausage patties were cooked fresh immediately and bought to my table....yum!  Not to mention the made to order omelet station hit the gooey spot! I had two of those fluffy and cheezy things and should be keeling over from a blocked artery at any moment, lol! This is a nicely decorated but no frills type of buffet. For the reasonable price, delicious and uniquely flavored homestyle fried chicken and my special request being honored so graciously I cannot say anything negative about this brunch buffet!   Free Mimosas on top of that....I'm sold! :)",

We added on the \"all you can drink for 4.99\" beverage package from 4-6. This sounded like a good idea at the time, however it only included beer wine and champagne.     You had to get it from the bartender and after the first drink there was such a huge line up that we only ended up getting one more ( hardly all you can drink )   They should of serve yourself wine and champagne if it's all you can drink !   Also they had no frozen cocktails ( despite them being on the sign / menu ) and when I asked about a double White Russian I was told it was 20$ !   The food also wasn't nearly as good. It was \"Steak night\" and my husbands was not even cooked inside.   The seafood came with a cracker but not with tiny seafood forks to get the meat from inside. Imagine how much crap is wasted because of this !   The salad bar again was the best part of the meal, and it wasn't as good as the first time.   The desert bar was filthy from the self serve ice cream with dirty dishes piled up.  There was many items that were missing.  ( carrot cake for one )   The creme brulee was just custard. What a Let down!  There was no hard candied shell on top.   The most appealing thing was  the bubble gum behind the glass we couldn't access.    Wow we wished we had never returned. Sorry More- this time More was one more time too much : (",

    "text": "This review is only for the BREAKFAST.  For $16, in a competitive environment like Las Vegas and especially within the Hotel Casinos, this place \"More: The Buffet @ The Luxor\" is sub-par to their peers in many aspects.  The price seems high for what you get, at least that's my opinion for the Breakfast selection.  That's what I'd imagine paying for a lunch, and/or for something with greater quantity of more diverse selection and better quality too.  The variety seems limited, very limited for a buffet.  They had for breakfast, from what I remember, only a few food stations including:  Fresh Omelet / Scramble Grill with a Chef, but otherwise just steam trays of:  Corned Beef Hash, Waffles, Pancakes, Apple Crepes, Cheese Crepes, PORK Based Meats (Bacon and Sausages), Eggs, Toast and some pastries, breads and fruit.  So, if you're Jewish or Muslim and can't eat the swine, know that there's not much selections other than their pork based breakfast meats.  If gambling income in a hotel subsidizes meals, this set-up should either be complimentary to those who gamble or are hotel guests, or cost no more than $5.99 to bring people in.  The food quality wasn't bad, it was edible, and as I like to say in a cliched way, \"I wouldn't throw her outta bed\" - - so, can't complain that it didn't do the trick to fulfill the ultimate goal of feeding an appetite.  The rating I'm giving this is more based on \"in comparison to both what's available in the area and what you can get or that same price elsewhere nearby\" so, if I were to make a suggestion, I'd say they need to improve to keep up with the competition in other hotel casinos.  It's located in a lower level, and had a line to wait in (not sure how many patrons were 1st time visitors as opposed to repeat visiting fans, i'd guess all were newbies) that went by fast to get seated.  The drinks are self service, as of course the buffet food is, so it does the job as far as being a fast way to get fed and get in and out quickly.  For those who are coming to the Luxor, the self-parking is not connected to the Hotel / Casino, so it's a tad off-site, where you have to walk outside a little bit and a short distance, but for those who that's an issue for, be warned or go to the Valet.",

Second of all, a lot of the food labels were missing, and you'd have to wait for one of the employees to help you out( which they gladly did).  Now, out of EVERYTHING we had for dinner, the only things that were good was the steak. The aisian section was only ok. For breakfast, I tried a wide variety of things and only 3 things were good in my opinion: the cake with cranberries in it and the honeydew melon( maybe because no one tried to make it into sth else) and the pancakes. The most horrific thing was the scrambled eggs with cheese. The waffles werent horrific but were chewy and sad.  Staff is really friendly though, which is why I gave this place a second star.",

Most buffets charge us full price for her, which is just a waste for us.  We found the area to be spacious and easy to move around in.  Negatives were that although it was lunch time, there were a lot of options still unavailable. Even when we left around 1pm. I don't expect the same spread for lunch as for dinner, but it did seem a bit limited.  Overall, the food was pretty good...except for their Mexican section. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and there was nothing there to brag about. We actually couldn't finish anything we grabbed from the Mexican food section, unfortunately.  Thankfully, there were some very yummy options that left us, and our kids, full regardless.  The Mexican food and lunch were a bit disappointing, but we would definitely go back. Maybe for dinner next time",

We tried SO HARD to just have a good ol' munchy binge but it was disappointment after disappointment. We would bring back full plates of what should have been delicious food and ended up spitting half of it out into our napkins. What's that saying? \"Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink.\"  I know it's bad because I've happily eaten fried bread and ketchup when I've been this stoned.  I'm serious, even the soda machines tasted flat and watered down.  On the plus side, they do provide all you can drink alcohol. I'm going to get started on that.  The service is good. Friendly staff-- who obviously aren't used to being tipped. Boyfriend gave a 25% tip and was stopped 3x to ask if he meant to give the waitress that much.  It's weird. It's gross. It's perfect for the alcoholic your dating. The exotic decor will wow her and you won't break the bank! :)",

The turkey was moist and not dried out, but I was expecting to see turkeys at carving stations, but the sliced turkey portions were at the serving stations. They had kielbasa that tasted more like regular sausage and kind of on the dry and overcooked side. The carved ham was good, and so were the grilled 4oz. steaks. I tried to get some stuffing for the turkey, but it would not come off of the serving spoon, even after a few shakes! LOL!!                Beyond what I had, there really wasn't much to choose from. Peeled shrimp were small, and kind of mushy. I passed over the Asian and Italian sections. It seemed as though they only had two soups to choose from(chicken vegetable and what I believed to be, butternut squash). Maybe there were more at other stations, and I just didn't look hard enough. Macaroni and potato salads were quite good. No room for desert, so I guess that means I did enjoy and fill up on what I did find, and at 30.00, it may have been better just to go back to Hooters for a third visit, or spend a few dollars more for maybe another restaurant or buffet, but I was leaving the next day and just wanted to save a few bucks for my week back to work! I can't really complain and if you see my pic, I had two plates of that, it obviously was not bad, just wished there was a bit more to choose from at, More the buffet! One other thing, the table with empty plates was not bussed very fast, and was not all that busy at around 5:00pm.",

    "text": "This was the most disappointing buffet I've ever had the displeasure of trying, in Vegas or otherwise.  The two of us paid $50 for a Weekend Brunch buffet and, between the two of us, we found exactly one thing that was halfway decent: the bread pudding.  Besides that, the food was on par with gas station fare or frozen microwaveable selections from the supermarket. Just awful. Avoid at all costs.   The eggs were tasteless. The sausage was hard, dry, and unseasoned. The pancakes ranked several places below McDonald's HotCakes, which is incredibly difficult to do. The bacon was flaccid and reeked of artificial smoke flavor. The biscuits were hard and crumbly. The biscuit gravy was watery and tasted of raw flour.  The cheese blintz was literally ricotta cheese stuffed into a sad, crusty crepe that tasted of Play-Doh -- and that's no exaggeration.   I desperately wanted to like this food, particularly considering the price we paid and the fact that I picked this place over my wife's objection -- so I decided to broaden my horizons and try the Asian and Dessert sections. First, I tried the Chow Mein, which seemed to consist of three low-quality ingredients: overcooked spaghetti, sesame oil and soy sauce. The \"Veggie\" Spring Roll was literally completely devoid of filling, as was the Apple Turnover. Finally, I tentatively took a forkful of the bread pudding -- it wasn't bad at all!  The Anglaise was nice and thick, the bread pudding wasn't too goopy, and the raisins seemed well distributed throughout the dish.   Please don't make the same mistake as we did. Run as far away as you can from this pathetic excuse for a buffet.",

I tried at least 15 different things  and nearly all of it either was kind of cold, or hard - because of sitting under the lights. Or just had no flavor at all. I think of everything I tried, only one thing was worth it, and that was the steak - solely because he was cooking it to order.   Unless they fix the lack of flavor and food in their buffet, I don't think I'd be back.",

I've been going to Vegas for decades, so I've hit some buffets, but Luxor's ties with Circus Circus for the worst in the city. It's awful. To start with, many of the stations were empty, so they're charging people when it looks like 1/4 of the selections are missing. And what is there is just boring, like a school lunch.  But then the food that is suppose to be hot, like pasta, is barely warm. And tasteless. There were three of us and each of us was taking a bite of something and saying, \"Don't bother with this.\"  The one thing I found that was tasty and the proper temperature was the couscous. If you respect your palate at all,  don't even consider this buffet. Go to M, Bellagio, Spice Market or the Main St downtown.",

It's a steep price to pay for breakfast, plus I can't eat much in the morning. I got a mimosa with my buffet. The highlight was the omelet bar and the shrimp. They had decently fresh shrimp, maybe about 6-8 size. The have your standard salad and breakfast food bar. The only \"meat\" they had was the roast beef and it was a bit dry. The Asian food wasn't very good, especially the pad thai had no taste. There was nothing special about this place. It was hearty and feeling, but not worth the $17.99 brunch!",

The $15 breakfast price tag is not bad.    A venti coffee and pastry at Starbucks costs $10, so what the heck we can have whatever we want for $5 more.  Besides, it's hard to screw up breakfast!",

There are multiple stations with food, but they all have the same items: bacon, biscuits & gravy, breakfast potatoes, etc.. The only edible food available was the fresh fruit, and that's all I could eat after sampling the hot options. $18 for a banana and some melon. This experience has written me off of Las Vegas buffets; thank you More buffet.",

My husband got a slice of pizza, took a bite and the dough was completely RAW. Disgusting. I ended up having fruit and juice and a random dessert. When we were ready to leave I approached the hostess just to give her some feedback about how horrible the food was and she already knew! She nodded her head and without saying a word, she waved down the manager who offered my money back. If a place knows their food is THAT bad, and willingly gives you your money back, shouldn't that place just CLOSE? Why is it even open? Also, one of my friends ended up throwing up his food in the middle of eating. Yeah. It was that bad. Never ever ever again!",

MORE has the typical american, asian, mexican, italian theme sections, and each section has about 4-5 choices.  The quality is variable, and I'd say ranges from \"mediocre\" to \"not bad\".  Nothing was stellar, though this could be expected for a $16 lunch buffet.  Service was fine, and the decor is passable.  Would I return? Maybe - if I happened to be waiting at the Luxor for a show or something.",

You had American, Italian, and Asian food all in one place. Talk about a delight. The choices were endless. The food was fresh and set at the perfect temperature. I must say after eating there we were stuffed. Definitely money well spent!",

    "text": "Alrighty then. As a general rule I always eat at a buffet in Vegas. I was stayed at the Excalibur and they were just a drag so instead of eating at their buffet I came to this one at the Luxor instead. I was really impressed by the decor. That is a big think for me when coming to a themed place in Vegas. They went all out here. We came for lunch and they had a decent selection of food. They had American, Mexican, Italian, Asian, etc. Very typical of a Vegas buffet. They had a large salad and fruit section and an area to make sandwiches should you want to. Some of the food was great while some of it sucked but I don't expect to like everything I try at a buffet so it was no biggie. They had a big enough selection of food and plenty of things I wanted to try to make up for the things I did not like. Their dessert selection was nothing short of awesome. Very overwhelmingly filled with tasty treats to try. The only thing I did not like was their flan. It was flavorless but their creme brulee was to die for. The prices were very typical for a Vegas buffet. You get your own drinks which I like alot because you do not have to wait around for anyone. They have sodas from the fountain, juices, and milk. The busboys collecting the plates were very nice and I liked the customer service there. Overall I would say I had a very enjoyable experience here and I will return to this buffet when I stay at the Luxor. If I stay elsewhere I will eat at their buffet because that is how I try to play it.",

Kind of, but you can't be surprised, given the location.   Located downstairs in the LUXOR hotel & casino, this place is hardly ever crowded except for dinner time... However, that doesn't keep this place from having a line!   I would've given this place four stars, if not for the incredibly rude and inconsiderate woman at the register! If you're going to charge the Strip prices, make sure your service is on par. This place is just lucky they have great advertising.

I base the 4 stars on the price you pay compared to others in the area.  This one is on the lower price rage so you get what you pay for.  That being said, this place does a good job for the investment.    It's mainly comfort food.  The international foods have all been Americanized, which isn't bad if you're looking for a buffet of fast food.  For example, their Asian section had Orange Chicken, which I love.  The more expensive buffets generally put more exotic Asian cuisine out.    The atmosphere is fun as it's in the basement, but decorated with, again an Americanized, Egyptian feel.  But still fit the theme of the entire resort.  This buffet has a all day all you eat in combination with the Excalibur Buffet.  We didn't get that because we had plans to be elsewhere in the PM, but a good choice if you have kids and are staying at one of the 2 hotels.",

The dinner Buffett is about $30 a person and is not a bad value compared to the restaurant venues in Vegas. One of the best things about the dinner Buffett is that there are crab legs, crab claws, mussels, and cocktail shrimp. Be prepared to go wild if you're a seafood foodie! In regards to the other food, they have a carving station with beef, ham and turkey. They also have an Italian, Asian and Mexican section as well. Most of the hot entrees were mediocre at best, but the turkey was definitely a hit. Another good thing about the Buffett is that there is unlimited soft drinks, coffee and tea, so get ready to drink up! One last thing I want to mention about the Buffett is that there is a large dessert station with a bunch of assorted cheesecakes, ice cream and various custards. Overall, if you want decent food at an affordable price, then I highly recommend trying this Buffett and gambling at the casino as well.",

And ingredients are not listed on the labels for any of the food. Which, if I had any criticism for them I would say to have the ingredients clearly listed for every food. But anyway, I asked JR if there's a way to find out if there's anything in certain foods that I can't have and he was more than happy to help me out and call out the chef, Rubin.  Rubin comes out and asks what I need to know so I tell him I'm vegan and was wondering about the rice and beans.  He tells me he used to be vegan (I get excited at this point cause now I know he knows what he's talking about).  This angel sent from heaven then offers to walk me around the buffet to show me everything that's vegan friendly.  He then says they have white rice and veggies that they could stir fry in olive oil for me if I want it.  Then, he offers to make the stir fry HIMSELF AND BRING IT OUT TO ME. Let me tell you, I'm from the Midwest and no one (especially at buffets) knows anything about veganism and they all act like I'm some kind of nuisance for having dietary restrictions.  I almost cried because I was so happy and he made me feel like my beliefs were valid and important- so did JR.  Please give Rubin and JR a raise or something. I wish all restaurant employees were like them.",

I wouldn't choose to eat here [paying full price] as I feel that they are way over priced for what they serve. If you get the \"Take 2 Pass\" which allows you to eat here and at the Excalibur buffet for 24 hours, it might be worth it if you're able to eat at least 3 times. They have the standard buffet foods here and the drinks are self-serve. At best, they are a $14.95 per person buffet for brunch/dinner.  Service is somewhat slow in getting the dirty plates off the table but it's tolerable as the staff seems to be trying hard to get it done (they always seem to be short staffed). There are tons of better options but for comped or \"2 for 1\", go for it.",

    "text": "I had a myVegas comp for the buffet and used it last night.  I was surprised by the get your own drinks, but that's OK with me.  I didn't have to wait for anyone other than myself.  I started by doing a walk through of the entire area to see what they had.  I ended up starting with salads.  I had macaroni salad-pretty standard and OK.  The western salad was shredded lettuce with red bell pepper and fresh jalapeno rounds.  This salad had a nice kick and was quite good.  I also had some couscous which also was good.  I did find some bread sticks by the salad station.  In the regular roll area, they had standard large rolls.  They were out of butter packets so only small margarine containers were available.  The breadstick didn't need it.  I then went to the carving area and he had a new piece of beef.  This is not prime rib.  It looked like it was a rectangle of beef and it looked well done.  When I asked the gentleman where had all the nice rare meat gone that had been there when I did my walk through, he cut the beef in half and gave me a nice slice from the less done inside.  I got a piece of bok choy, some hush puppies, and a macadamia crusted chicken breast with apricot.  There was no  macadamia nut flavor at all.  The apricot gave the chicken some taste rather than being plain chicken.  I then went to the desserts.  They had a fairly nice selection of the small plastic cups that are appearing in buffets everywhere.  My first plate had a panna cotta with a lemon top filling with a fresh raspberry, flan with a fresh blackberry and some chopped nuts, and a small container of chocolate trifle.  The panna cotta and the chocolate trifle were great--the flan less so.  Second dessert plate had a macadamia nut cookie, a small pastry filled with vanilla cream and another fresh raspberry, and the star of the desserts, an Oreo cookie cheesecake.  The buffet was OK.  For the $22 they charge, you're not getting the kind of fare you'd get at the Bellagio or other property but they also charge $10 or more.  I wouldn't drive to the Strip to pay for this buffet.  We have a lot better choices in our locals casinos not on the Strip.  But for a comp, it was a nice dinner.  And I really did like the fact that I got more iced tea anytime I wanted without waiting.  Finally, every time I left my table, it was bussed before I got back.  That's not something that happens at all buffets.  I saw several people leaving last night without leaving even a dollar for the bus person.  I know I did most of the work, but he cleaned my table before, during, and after my dinner there last night.  He and the other wait staff deserve a tip!",

In addition to breakfast they had lots of other things including shrimp and chicken!    I was a little bummed with the advertised \"unlimited mimosas\" that came in small glasses and lots of pulp but for the price, I'll take it and refills!  Overall, if I stay at this hotel again and want a breakfast buffet, I will definitely come back.",

Each year its been getting worse and worse and yesterday topped it all. The breakfast buffet options seemed to have gotten less and the food quality isn't anything different than a hometown buffet. Example: they no longer serve eggs benedict...The fruit options were pretty much nonexisiten/little options, the cottage cheese looked disgusting and even the dessert section had little options.   The price for the buffet is outrageous. To top it all off no one even came by once to grab our plates. Never going back to that buffet as it's over priced for what your getting which is pretty much nothing.",

I was a bit disappointed with the selection, given the price of $20.99. The quality of the food was well below average. But it's a buffet, and these are never super great. I vowed to not eat here again. (The Pyramid Cafe is much better with fresh, made to order breakfasts!) But alas, Sunday rolls around, and I'm really tired of what's around me. There's a weekend brunch that costs $4 more, so I figured they must have more foods, right? Weekend brunches at other places generally are \"special\".  Wrong. They had even less food. On Wednesday, they had a ham and beef roast. There's none of that. There was nothing new that wasn't available on Wednesday. There's no omelet station or other place to get anything custom. You even have to make your own waffles and pancakes. So you pay more for less food, simply because it's the weekend, and they want to squeeze money money out of you. Sure, they have mimosa's included, but not everyone drinks alcohol. And especially not for breakfast!  I've been to far better Sunday brunch buffets at higher end restaurants that didn't cost any more and put this to shame.   I'd sure this up as an \"all you dare to eat\" buffet. And it's not much.",

    "text": "Enjoyed the breakfast buffet. There was a great selection and variety of foods, pastries, and fresh fruit. We arrived at the restaurant pretty early ( the restaurant opens at 7am) so there were not many people there. The food was fresh. The staff was somewhat friendly. The lady taking the money appeared frustrated.   When you enter the restaurant there is someone who takes your order and then a waitress or waiter comes to greet you and takes you to your table. You have the option to add your gratuity when you pay for the food. The breakfast buffet is $20 per person or you can pay $50 for the day ( meaning you are able to go the buffet at any point that day it is open). I'm not sure if this option for the \"day\" is always available.   Our waitress was friendly and gave us a tour of the buffet which was helpful. Again, there was a variety of food available as well as juices and soft drinks. I  recommend the breakfast bar and plan to come back again.",

The food is actually pretty fresh and it's pretty good for food made in bulk (I'm assuming it is..?). We were helped immediately for our second admission they and got our table literally right when we got there. There's plenty of options. It's a pretty good buffet - some of the options were the same for the different menu times but overall it was good.",

    "text": "This review is for the weekday all-day ayce deal.  The value (low, low price for unlimited trips) def earned the 3rd star.  Otherwise, the food quality, taste, and selection would have only garnered 2 stars.  Breakfast:  I thought it was really cool that they had oatmeal, grits, and malt-o-meal out :) Oldest son enjoyed the sausage patties. Eggs benedict sucked (my husbands exact words) The poached egg was cooked hard (I like mine runny) and the sauce was cold and coagulated. Fruit was really cold, and not as ripe as I would have liked.    Lunch: I enjoyed the wonton soup and the fact that they had red pepper flakes available.  Oldest and youngest loved the dessert bar - especially the chocolate mousse.  Husband found the garlic bread to be light and tasty.  Buffalo macaroni salad seemed to be nothing but pink macaroni salad.  Kids report that the pizza was hard :( And unfortunately someone at all the wontons out of the soup, so after the 1 I got in my first serving, I ate just plain broth for the rest of lunch and most of dinner.  Also, we happened to be eating lunch right when they started changing everything out for dinner, so for a big chunk of time there was even less selection as they pulled items and then took a while to replace them.  Dinner:  Selection really did not change very much from lunch.  Cole slaw was tasty :) Husband liked the pork chop quite a bit.  Service was pretty good, but we did wish that when we came back wearing our all-day wristbands that we could just walk right in.  Instead, we had to wait in line while everyone else paid for their meal.  All in all, good value if you are just looking to fill bellies without having to put much effort into deciding what to eat.  Foodies with $$ to spend should head elsewhere for sure!",

But what I really appreciated was that they had several options for vegetarians, including bruschetta, greek salad, tabbouleh, couscous, etc. My trip to the salad bar was easily my favorite plate, although they were sadly lacking in options for my actual salad (no mushrooms, olives, etc.). This may not be the best buffet in Vegas, but it's one of the better ones for vegetarians and the most affordable.",

Good bacon, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy.  Scrambled eggs - some say they are powdered, but they still tasted fine and had a good consistency.  Scrambled eggs and chorizo was delicious.  Avoid the eggs benedict, however, as the hollandaise was a strange orange color and had a funny taste.  Corned beef hash was the canned variety, but I like all kinds of CBH, and even canned CBH is still CBH.  Therefore, I liked the CBH.  At 9:00 a.m. the line was long with a 20 minute wait.  At 8:00 a.m. there was no line whatsoever.  Go early and get a head start on your day!",

This deal included mimosas at brunch and one glass of beer or wine with dinner, which I thought wasn't bad.  The package price for both meals together was very reasonable, especially for Vegas -- the package cost less than dinner at several other places we ate.    I would give brunch 3 stars, and dinner 2 stars.  Lots of good choices for things to eat for breakfast.  Dinner was another story...  They served many of the same dishes at dinner as at brunch!  That's a reason right there not to purchase an \"eat all day\" package, regardless of the included booze.  Also, the buffet looks like it can handle a much bigger spread (ie more food choices) for dinner, but the choices seemed limited.    Other notes:  Many dessert choices, with a few sugar-free/no sugar added options.  No wait service -- not even for drinks.  If you have picky children, More is an okay choice.  Foodie adults should definitely eat elsewhere.",

Her answer was, \"I didn't know\" and continued to seat the group of six first. The party of six was kinda embarrassed and asked Betty if she would like to seat is first and she said, \"no, I'll just seat you first\". She didn't even apologize for her mistake but made a statement of I didn't know??? Like wtf. The when she was seating us which happened to be in a small corner with a small table that was missing a chair. She then asked if this table is okay? I responded with, I guess if that's all you got.  She then said go ahead and help yourself to the buffet line as I get you another chair.  It ruined my dinner cause everything didn't taste good for me being that I was upset.

Seating is much more comfortable, with many small independent seating sections so the overall atmosphere is quiet. The soft lighting contributes to this effect.   Service was friendly and attentive.  The food was average to mediocre. Not a huge variety and overall most foods tended to be more on the bland side. There's Italian, Mexican and Chinese stations as well as more traditional stations with hot dogs and roasts.  The pizza is about as bland as it can get and so were the lasagna.  There were a couple items that I did enjoy though: chicken spring rolls and mongolian beef.  In the dessert station, the apple pie has a pleasant tanginess but the crust was bland. The cheesecake on the other hand was very filling and satiating with just about the right amount of sweetness.  Lunch costs about $17/person and dinner about $21.  While i appreciated the new layout the food is definitely not the same as it was about a year ago. Overall 2.5/5.",

The children's section was terrible. Soggy pasta, soggy chicken nuggets ect. The fact that they had a wide array of drinks as part of the buffet made me happy.

The side dishes were tasty, with a large variety.  Most items were well stocked and the buffet was tidy.  It wasn't bad.      Low points:  very little choice on the salad bar.  I know I know, who goes to Vegas to eat salad?  I like having a little healthy/fresh food on vacation!  I was hoping for a little more variety.  The Asian selection - wow - everything tasted like it was covered in sugar.  It was disappointing and inedible.  Avoid it!!!    The usual turn-offs for me as far as buffets - hordes of rude children and adults who push and shove you to get to what they want despite the semblance of an orderly line or the fact that you're walking and happen to be in their path.    It's a little pricey for the quality, but with deals and vouchers it's not a bad way to pick and choose your way to an OK dinner.",

    "text": "First, was disappointed with the quality of the food, the eggs were watery and tasteless, the biscuits were hard and stale, there were obvious entrees lacking, like in the Asian food section, there were holes where something should be, but only rice, chow mein and bakchoy were there. The sushi area was without, and the girl said that it all had to be gone before she could/would put out more, the \"all\" were tiny picked over pieces of sushi that were falling apart. Just like at the carving station, there was ham and turkey... what was the horseradish for? the beef gravy? Just about everything was lousy, bland, lukewarm, and depressing.   I did appreciate that the bacon is Gluten Free... the only item I actually noticed with the GF circle on it... I am not a GF person, but I found it amusing.   The highlight of our breakfast, the person before us dropped tongs into the syrup, and a guy in a chef coat (they all wear) with no nametag, that kinda looked like Mike Tyson, pulled them out and put them back for the next person, (my wife or I) to grab them and get our hands covered with syrup. So I pulled them out and slid them on the back of the counter... the actually ended up slipping off and onto the floor in front of him. He the got really belligerent and confrontational, wanting to know \"what you do that for\" to which I told him they were covered with syrup and people shouldn't have to use them. Also, I wonder about the hygiene standards... to me that seems the same as if someone were to have dipped their hands in the syrup, but really who knows how many people handled those tongs before they went in to the syrup. I would HOPE that if someone were dipping their bare hands into the food, it would be thrown out and replaced.  Afterwards, a quick stop at the dessert bar, and I don't know about that, completely pathetic. I could whip together better desserts, and I am not by any means a pastry chef.   There was not even ordinary about the buffet, it was entirely below average, and for the $20 or whatever a Saturday morning brunch is, totally not worth it. Even without the negative encounter, the missing food, the poor food, the horrible attitude of the staff...   Except for our server, I cannot recall her name, but my wife went up to the buffet leaving her purse unattended, the waitress stopped by to tell us she kept an eye on it for us. She received a nice tip, much nicer than if she hadn't said anything since the rest of the experience was so unsatisfactory. The 1 Star is completely for the waitress. The rest of the experience would rank a 0.",

    "text": "For $20 lunch buffet, I expected it to be at least half decent. NOPE. I should have suspected it wasn't that great since it was not busy with hungry patrons. I don't know why the previous reviewer said there was a variety of foods. C'mon they didn't even have General Tsao chicken, steak, or even fried chicken. Barely any meat dishes, just ham and turkey. They also did not have gelato ice cream. Most of the food was not even lukewarm.  I was also surprised to see that the drinks were self serve (which I don't mind) but they ask you if you want to pay a tip ahead of time when you pay for your entry, so no waitress available except the person who takes your finished plate away. The only good dish was the lasagna, veggie soup, and the limited dessert station.   Overall, highly regrettable buffet especially one that is on the strip.  I went to Red Rock casino buffet a couple days before for lunch which costs us $14.99, and it had a lot more variety and better quality food. Please save your money and pay the extra $5 at a different casino on the strip for a more worthwhile experience.",

Desserts... just wow. Kudos to your bake staff, and overall staff for bringing a good experience to my dining.  FYI... those of you comparing this buffet to aria, bellagio, or any other high end buffet, you can't compare apples to hub caps. This is a blue collar buffet for those of us who can't afford $40 for a small buffet and want to opt for a larger selection at a reasonable price.

It felt like the end of the night and they were about to clean up, even though it was prime time for dinner on a Saturday. The servers were nice.  As the drinks are self serve, they only provided straws when asked, and cleaned up the tables. I expect more from a Vegas casino. I should have got the hint when they ask to pay a tip upon entry.

And the pancakes tasted as if they came from the freezer.  Worst buffet I have ever had. I live in n Reno and all of there buffets are way better and cost less. I attempted to call and talk to someone and was hung up on. The mumisoas was flat and all you tasted was sour orange juice. There was no selection for lunch.",

I attempted to get crab twice, and both times, it was in the water for way too long. I even saw a cook leave older mixed veggies in a pan, and then throw fresh cooked veggies in a pan and mixed them. Why would someone want both fresh and over cooked/have been in a serving tray too long mixed together. I had crab (F), ginger chicken (which I enjoyed), white rice, chickpeas (which I really enjoyed), steak ( C), pesto pasta salad ( A), corn on the cob ( C). I gave it 2 stars because I mention the crab quality to the manager, and he really showed concern and tried to help. Also, the staff were pleasant (service is always important to me) and there some items that was ok.",

Then again, I still have yet to visit the beloved Bacchanal buffet, but let's be objective here!  This buffet is definitely one of the cheaper buffets on the LV strip. Located at the unique Luxor, I was able to take the shuttle to the buffet from where I was staying (Mandalay Bay).   I was intrigued by the deals this place had. Check out the tips by fellow Yelpers below, apparently they have a 2 for 1 deal or something like that. I wish I could have taken advantage of the offer but I was only in LV for a short time.   Considering the price, I would give this place a solid 4 stars. They serve a variety of foods from Mexican, American, to Asian. No complaints. All the dishes I ate were delicious. They also serve crab, which they strip for you. They serve it cold but you can also request that they warm it up for you.  I took off one star because it took a while to get into the buffet even though there was such a short line. Not to mention, the lady who rung us up was totally rude and inconsiderate. Despite the lackluster customer service, I'm coming back for the food and the value!",

Part of our Vegas itinerary included a stop at a buffet. My inclination was to go to the Mandalay Bay buffet. I figured that with the Asian influence and theme, there ought to be some pretty palatable food there.  However, that wasn't the case. My cheap friends vetoed it and voted for the Luxor.  The buffet was very clean and the ambience was nice. Those are the high points. Unfortunately for the Luxor, buffets are all about food and this is where it fell flat. For $20, I expected a pretty decent buffet. Heck, Benihana in Seattle has all you can eat sushi for $15 at lunch. No. Not decent.  The Asian food all seemed like a generic \"Super Lucky Grand Panda Buffet\" that you see in a bad strip mall. Orange chicken? Egg rolls? Check and check. The pizza made Domino's look gourmet. The only food that was reasonably palatable was the Mexican food. If you get dragged to the Luxor, go to that station and fill up.  Two stars? Yeah. I didn't get food poisoning and got full.

MORE does have a bar located at the west end of the building which helps make the food tolerable.  If you go, notwithstanding this review, I strongly urge you to smoke or drink something so potent, you're 'seeing things' prior to your binge.

I was impressed by the food selection...but not so impressed by the quality. The breakfast food was all pretty decent. I had a lard-fest of potatoes, chorizo scrambled eggs, a spanish omelet, eggs benedict, and bacon on one occasion. Not bad...but it could have been because I was FAMISHED. Not the highest quality of food, like I said, but for the price, it was bearable.  The brunch with the mimosas and champagne was a little more sub-par. The mimosas were surprisingly good, even though they probably used sparkling apple juice or something equally weak. It was a little early in the AM for me...but I figured if I was paying for it, I might as well get it.  The food was BLEH. I had some weird kind of fried rice and lo mein that was covered in grease and very bland. The mac and cheese looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The pasta salads were the only thing that I was happy to eat...but I guess it's hard to mess up a pasta salad.  Not the worst food I've ever had...but very far from the best. Service was good though.

    "text": "We purchased the full day buffet special for $32 because we though it would be amazing food at a great price. While it was a good deal, the food was disappointingly average. The lunch and dinner menu were the exact same two days in a row, which got boring really fast.  Lastly, there was a Mexican section [enchiladas, beans, rice...], a Chinese, section [orange chicken, rice, egg rolls...], and an Italian section [spaghetti, meatballs...] with food that looked and tasted like something from Denny's. I recommend you only eat at the buffet once, probably breakfast.  Also, the dessert buffet was alright; apple pie, frozen yogurt, cheesecake, brownie bites, mousse pie, stuff bought from the store. This buffet is one step above the buffet at the  \"Exacalibur,\" ...and that isn't saying much.",

Then I wound up w a Luxor dining comp I didn't use and it was time to leave so needed something easy and went back.  hoping it would be better the second time around.  it wasn't.  Not bad buffet for the price, just not great.  Granted, I only did breakfast.  But Manadaly Bay and Main St Station were the  other two breakfast buffets i did while in town and they were way better.  Even the Stratosphere breakfast buffet last time I came to Vegas beat this.",

    "text": "OMG what is this crap?!! Excuse my ruthlessness when it comes to reviewing this buffet...........but I think it's the worse food I've ever had.....come on Luxor...you gotta do better than that!   So I got 2 complimentary lunch buffet at the hotel we stayed at and the choices were Aria, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, Mirage and MGM Grand...We were getting lunch pretty late around 3pm...we wanted to try Aria or Mandalay Bay but we walked to both and they were closed for lunch already and I didn't feel like walking back to Mirage, MGM or Monte Carlo and I was starving by the time we reached Luxor/Excalibur/Mandalay Bay so we decided maybe Luxor was the better choice than Excalibur.   Well I don't know how the buffet is at Excalibur but omg barely anything was edible at this buffet....they served some crappy Mexican dishes...the tamale was super dry, there weren't many selections either....the pasta was undercooked....and they had Chinese food that was like from the $1 chinese express restaurants. Horrible!  Okay so the only thing I actually liked was their Creme Brulee.....but that was the only decent dessert they had...the rest of the desserts looked pretty unappetizing  =/  I should have filled up with the creme brulee...instead I gulped down the food that was on my plate just so I didn't have to waste it....-_-\"  I'm so glad it was complimentary because if I had to pay $16 for this crap...I would be demanding for a refund! haha and yes I know it was only $16 dollars....you pay for what you get...cause most good buffets are at least $25 and up...but gah....it shouldn't be this horrid under $20 either. -_-\"  So needless to say I would not come back here ever.!!!!!",

So is the spaghetti, and the paella with seafood. You can tell the place is designed for some privacy, some mystique of an Egyptian dig site, so ambiance rates a lot with me. Yes, they could have maximized the seating areas for more $$$ but chose to give their patrons a nicer environment. That effort is a lot in my book.  The staff have an organized system for the line, and that impresses me. There is nothing I hate more than a line with no order, no system, which allows others to come in at a haphazard and undefined point in time. A little wait, yes, but again they have a system in place.  As for the desserts, their wide selection is just more than you can tackle.  The only thing I did not like were the tiny, tiny sow crab legs They were so skinny. I was at the Rio seafood buffet the evening before so I have had my fill of crab legs so I did not try the ones here. I am glad I did not have to, as they were so thin and watery.  CANNOT compare this to buffets $35 and up. This belongs to the $14-$24 range. I really did enjoy my dinner there.",

(I wait longer than that for breakfast at the local diner by my house in San Diego.) We were given a booth for 2 ppl. (Always a plus)   Food for breakfast was eggs Benny waffles, pancakes, the basics. But tons of crispy bacon.   Beverage service is more like a cafeteria from college. Grab your own, which can get hard with coffee orange juice and breakfast. In one trip. Here's a tip, take more than one trip. Oh and take as many as you want, bc I said all you can drink mimosas right?   No, it's not ceasars.

(For example, the eggs taste like they came from a box - made with water, the hot dogs were soggy and gross, even the pizza was old and nasty.) The drinks were watered down. Orange juice tasted like orange-colored water.  Desserts existed and looked OK, but when you ate it - they were bland and didn't have any taste. (empty calories).

While that may be True for Friday/Saturday dinner, the quality is sorely lacking at other times.  I went during an off-peak time:  a weekday for breakfast.     I'll start off with the pros:  the staff is very friendly, and the Egyptian theming of the buffet is really nice. Also, there are lots of secluded areas so you're not right on top of other people.  The positives unfortunately end there.  Other than the fruit, the food was inedible.  The bacon and sausage were limp and extremely greasy.  The coffee was burnt.  The eggs were watery, too salty, and had a very strange aftertaste.  The waffles, pancakes, and hash browns were stale and also had a strange aftertaste.

Waiters: One showed us our table, but nobody showed up afterwards to e.g. remove our plates, etc.   Food selection: Nothing special, selection was on the small side. Most of the selection was carried forward from breakfast.   Food quality: cheap, my taste buds were not amused.

The dessert section has all kinds of sweet delicacies, and the drink possibilities are numerous. There are some times where one menu runs out, but it is quickly refilled.

All the food was well prepared and very tasty. It is not as fancy as the Wynn or Caesars, but is a great buffet for the price. They also have a happy hour wrist band for all you can drink beer and wine that is a great deal!",

We went for an early lunch and really it was just to get his parents in the same hotel as the Titanic Exhibit.  The Luxor buffet reminded me of the scene in National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation when the Cousin Eddie takes Walt to the buffet = \"I'll have the blue stuff.\" Nothing was blue, but there was definitely a lot of mystery meat in sauce.   I really struggled to find food that looked appetizing and mostly stuck with bruised fruit and pizza. This buffet was terrible. The whole situation was made worse, since we had eaten at the Aria Buffet the day before. Naturally, we had not expected the Luxor to be on par with the Aria, but the difference was staggering.  I would not eat here again.",

The salad pickings, breads, appetizers and dressings are the stuff of cafeterias and Smorgasbords. Even Fresh Choice has more imagination.  The hot entrees were ALL terrible. No taste, no texture, no flavor. The desserts were even worse.  What a disaster ! If this buffet were $9.99 I MIGHT not have complained as much.   But at the price they charge, it should be good.

After eating at several other buffets around america, I would much rather eat at hometown buffet which is like eating burgers at McDonalds instead of In n Out burger. I am not trying to be mean but I feel that establishments like the MORE buffet take advantage of tourists. For the price and experience, does the luxor really consider this an example of american cuisine? The food should reflect the price and unfortunately, the food reflects low grade products. I did enjoy the ham but could not give you another example of things I enjoyed. The rolls were dry, the salad bar looked like wilted vegetables, the mexican food looked like a love child between taco bell and del taco. My wife tried the shrimp and she said it was gross. My response, be careful eating seafood at buffets like this. The ratings by other yelpers explain it all. Do not, I repeat, do not eat here unless you are okay with less than mediocre food. If you have a coupon...well...go for it. This is definitely more like a $15 buffet instead of the $25 asking price. I am an Mlife member and will stay clear of this place. Hey Luxor, look at the ratings and make some changes.",

We went to the dinner buffet prior to seeing Chris Angel's show Believe. It was something like $20 per person and the food was just ok. The show was just ok on that note! :) Not worth $20 at all. They have the expected and much anticipated by most snow crab legs but they were salty and about as good as your local Chinese buffet. The steamed shrimp was the highlight of my meal anyway. That was good. There was a good selection of food but the quality wasn't that good. The recipes were average, nothing special. I won't be back the next time I am in Vegas.  Definitely worth an extra $5 per person to eat at a buffet like the Bellagio. Very worth the extra cash.",

You definitely get what you pay for. The major problem for this buffet is the variety and quality. There are out 15 selections of warm items to choose from. 3 of those are pizza. There are CARBS everywhere. No meat selections other than the carving station.  They do have an omelette station if you so desire to wait 15 minutes to get yours.  The carving station meat is tough and chewy and by the time you reach the table the meat is cold.  Besides the food complaint, the cups and plates were not cleaned properly.

    "text": "Came here in July for my brother's birthday.  My brother was staying at the Luxor hotel while I was staying at another hotel near circus circus. We couldn't decide where to eat that night and my toddler and his gf were getting hangry.  We thought it would be quicker and easier if my family got in the car and drove to the Luxor to try The Buffet.    I don't remember the price but I think we paid around $140 for 5 adults and my kid was free.  After we paid, we had to wait to be seated. There was a family of 4 before us waiting to be seated as well.  Both parties had moved a little pass the register so that the people behind us could pay. Out of nowhere comes this lady who for the purpose of this story, will call Brenda.  Brenda goes to the line divider and pulls out the retractable belt and tells the family before us that they cannot go pass the line and tries to push them back.  The family tells Brenda that there isn't any room and that they paid but Brenda kept insisting that they go behind the line.  We try to make as much room for them but there is already people behind us.    The family before us gets seated and then it's our turn.  A lady who I'll call Nancy tell us to follow her then who I believe is the Manager tells Nancy that chairs cannot be placed on the side of booth and cannot block any walkways.  She tells us to following her but she we can tell she doesn't have a table for us as she looks lost.  She decides to have us wait in the middle of the place while she finds us a table.  She comes back and out of nowhere, Brenda comes too.  Both ladies are telling us they found us a table and to follow them and both start walking in opposite directions.  We all just stand there and ask who do we follow.  Nancy tell us to follow her so we do.  She leads us to a table that looks like a table for 2 but has 4 chairs around it.  I look at Nancy and I said we don't fit here.  She tells me that she cannot put a highchair at the end of a booth because she cannot block the walkway.  I told her I understand that but we are still a party of 5 adults without my child and how did she expect 5 adults to fit on that table.  She repeats that same thing and I again repeat the same thing.    Again, out of nowhere, here comes Brenda.  I ask her if she could show us the table that she found.  Turns out it a booth that can fit all 6 of us and did not require a chair to block the walkway.    The food was just ok.  They did not have much selections.  The place looked huge so I thought there was going to be lots of variety but there was not much.  They had about three bread stations. Typically, the Asian section has some sort of noodles, there wasn't any.  Typically, the Italian section has spaghetti noodles, there wasn't any of that either.  Each station had about three or four things.    We didn't eat much off our plate and again, out of nowhere, here comes Brenda taking away out plates.  I guess Brenda not only does security, a hostess, and the person that seats people, but is also the busgirl.  She notices that we are not eating much so she asked us why and about the food which i guess now makes her customer or guest services LOL.  Well she insists that we speak to the chef which we do.    I still gave it three stars because I am giving this place a review based on similar buffets with similar prices.  If I was going to pay $60/person and got the same food, then I would have gave one star.  I couldn't get mad at it.  I mean you get what you pay for, right?",

The ratings weren't all that great for it but we wanted to try it anyways. We came on a sunday and waited about 30min to be seated. At $20/person, I definitely got my money's worth. That's about it.  Nothing at the buffet really wow'd me. I tried all of the food options but the Mexican bar (it didn't look very appealing). I would have loved to see a bigger selection of asian food. All they had was fried rice, lo mein, and spring rolls. Pretty terrible selection.  Service was good. That's where most of the stars from this rating go towards. I won't be back. There are a lot of options in Vegas and this one didn't hit the mark.",

The meats were dry, the seafood was very low quality, but the desert section was decent.  Still, I'd rather eat at a Golden Coral.",

But what can take away from an entire good experience you ask, one very aweful bartender. On the first day I came to the buffet and was provided the most excellent service by jet the bartender so good that it made me want to come back the next day. I wish I didn't! PENNY the bartender provided the worst service I've ever had not a smile to be found and an attitude every time we approached the bar. I'm sorry it's so hard to poor an already mixed mimosa out of an already mixed container and to ice the cake she cut me off after two mimosas... literally mimosas champagne and orange juice not strong enough to get a insect drunk lol And her reasoning behind cutting me off was because I mentioned how she could act like she cared even if she was having a bad day.  So yes the buffet in it's self all good but Penny should be canned I'd hate for her to ruin anyone else's $27 buffet.",

    "text": "Buffets. They are the complete staple of what indulgent Vegas is. Buffets for me are a different beast. They satisfy literally every craving I have. I'm one of those people. You know the one, or know of a one. We're the ones that want to stop at every fast food joint so we can satisfy every sick craving. We're the ones that want a taco from Del taco, chicken nuggets from McDonalds, French fries from Wendy's, a cheeseburger from in n out, & to top of it, orange chicken from Panda Express. Yeah I'm that pain.  So for me, buffets are a complete necessity. I ended up doing the buffet on the Luxor since I had some myVEGAS points to spare. If I didn't end up having this buffet for free, the brunch price was a low price of $20.99. Seeing that and the reviews, I didn't have much hope for this place.  It's located underneath the casino, you travel down a too long corridor and a too long stairway entrance. You'll be greeted with your typical Vegas hospitality and be sat by an usher.   For this first place, I chose to go to the carving station. ( I couldn't believe they had this during a brunch. ) I opted for a slice of ham then continued to pile my plate with a dumpling ( didn't think they could mess this up ), some sauteed Chinese broccoli, and some bacon. Most of the things were pretty edible and surprisingly delicious. For example the ham & the sauteed Chinese broccoli had great flavor and seasoning. The other two, gross, gross, gross, did I mention gross?   The salad portion is your standard run of the mill with lettuce pieces that looked wilty and we're starting to brown.   The Mexican station, I did avoid completely. It looked like it would cause stomach problems and I was not willing to sacrifice my body for what would be a 30 seconds of tasty pleasure.   Surprisingly enough, their version of the California roll was edible and quite delicious. I went back for seconds. The second best thing? Their clam chowder. The pieces of clam were huge and the soup was consistently creamy; coating your tongue in every great way possible.  The only perk aside from the fact that I didn't have to pay for this ? The complimentary all you can drink mimosas. They came in deliciously handy in quenching my thirst.   Overall? This buffet doesn't claim to be the best. However, for the price, things are not bad and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the things that are great.",

The food was cold and I was the third customer in line. The hotel gave me a room on the 18th floor where the air conditioning barely was working so I called the front desk so they moved me to the 5th floor it felt like a  punishment for complaining. Your view was of the roof top and the view as you walk out the door you look at a maintenance ladder which looks like it's been there for 20 years due to the all the dust all over the area. The chairs at the bar were cracking and sagged in the middle. As I sat there play the 25 cent machine I had 3 7and 7  that were watered down and the bartenders keep looking at the jar for the tips another situation were they made you feel bad and I spent $80 for nothing and I tipped 20%.

Price wise the MORE Buffet is much better value than paying $23 at the Johnny Rockets for a burger, fries & shake..So if you are looking for mass consumption at a low price - this is your buffet.

I'm going to give them another star for replying.  My original review :  Pretty bland and unappealing weekend brunch buffet was included with our stay at the Luxor.    I'd say skip it    The folks at Luxor replied:  We are disheartened to learn your impressions of MORE the Buffet at Luxor, proved unsatisfying and unremarkable. We value your insights and hope your next visit to Las Vegas will include a meal at our establishment, so that we might change your opinions and provide you with a more enjoyable experience.  Sincerely,  Seth L.  Guest Relations Specialist Luxor Hotel & Casino MGM Resorts International  ***************  Seth,  Thank you very much for responding.  While my wife and I overall enjoyed our stay at Luxor we did find the More Weekend Brunch disappointing.    First of all the coffee was horrible.  The tiny selection of sushi that was out tasted like cardboard, the shrimp were water logged. They also had mussels and crawfish out.  Both were not good.  I would say you need to put some effort into the seafood or skip it all together.  The fresh fruit selection needs to be fresh and ripe.  For fresh fruit they had cantaloupe and honeydew sliced up.  It wasn't ripe and flavorful.  It was crunchy and tasteless.  How about some blueberries, strawberries, mango, watermelon, etc?      We had a much better breakfast the next morning at the Pyramid Cafe upstairs.",

We couldn't decide on dinner so we ended up here around 9:40 p.m. We had to clear out by 10:20 p.m.   Food = good.  Some items were hit or miss. They have an Asian bar, Latin bar, American bar, Italian bar, cold salad bar with fruit, snow crab legs, crawfish and shrimp, and a dessert bar.  Chinese was a greasy mess, but the Latin and salad bars were my favorite. Highlights: pork ragu, chili con carne, sweet corn medley, great salad bar choices.   Dessert = good. I tried their tiramisu, panna cotta, cannoli, eclairs and soft serve. Tiramisu and cannoli were great.  Eclairs were good, without the super sweet chocolate icing, and the custard inside was to die for.  Wish I could've had more room for dessert but it'd been a long day of eating.   Service = get your own drinks, too.  But we had a nice server nearby to bus the tables.  And turns out he's from the same little AL town as my Southern man.  Small world, ain't it?!   Pricing =  $23.99/pp  The convenience and the chance meeting made it worth a trip for us.  Food was okay.",

The ONLY reason I gave this buffet one star is because of the omelette station. They have a station to create your own omelette...which was pretty good. Everything else was not good at all. They do not have a large selection. The fruit was warm (no watermelon or strawberries?!) the silverware was dirty and the server was very standoff is and had to be called multiple times for assistance. Please...go elsewhere for your meals! There are plenty of great buffets in Vegas. It's worth the extra penny!",

I was overly impressed with everything about our 4-night stay at the facility, and sadly the lasting impression will be this terrible buffet we tried before heading to the airport.  Where do I start. Reasonably priced for a \"good\" buffet, but I wouldn't classify this as such. Let's go left to right. Breakfast items; no sausage left and the scrambled eggs were runny. Cold, soggy French toast and minimal syrup. Bacon was nicely cooked, and plentiful. Italian station, bland meatballs and sauce. Asian station, cold bone in teriyaki chicken and bland rice and over cooked book choy. No sushi to be found. Mexican station, cold tacitos, bland rice and cold posole!  Again - don't make this your last memory of your stay at the Luxor!",

The place wasn't crowded at all which means we didnt have to navigate around too many people. You are seated with a waitress who brings you drinks so you don't have to worry about having someone guard your stuff. The mimosas were pretty nasty, but then again I hate champagne. It didnt help that they were using watered down OJ from concentrate. They had a great breakfast selection including the basics like bacon (omg), potatotoes, eggs benedict, sasage, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, shrimp, waffles, crepes, etc. They also had a omelette bar where your own personalized omelette was cooked up right in front of you. I got ham and cheese, and it was goooood. The ham had really good flavor.  There was also a selection of cereal and granola which was nice.   In addition to brunch, there was also a selection of asian, tex mex, and american foods for lunch. All of which were mediocre. The desserts were TERRIBLE. They were all  single serving small and cute, but none of them had very much flavor. I shared a few with the boyfriend including chocolate mousse (the only relatively good one), tiramisu (ew), carrot cake (wtf), doughnut holes, and a pineapple tarte.  Overall I'd say it was just your average buffet food. I would reccomend the brunch after a night of drinking. It really hits the spot, but would probably avoid it for lunch and dinner.",

My wife and I had heard bad things about our hotel's buffet (Excalibur), but wanted to try Luxor's buffet. It was great!!!! The prices were fair considering the quantity and quality of food at your fingertips. They had everything you could want: American, Italian, Asian, Mexican, Salads, Comfort, etc and an extensive drink and dessert area complete with FULL bar. Now I can just hear people complaining about the price... yes, if you get just one plate of food, it's not worth the $17 for lunch you would pay. That's why you go to a buffet when you are HUNGRY and can eat a couple plates over a decent length of time, dumbass! My favorites were the fried chicken, pizza, carnitas tacos, and the desserts were... to... die... for! I will for sure be returning to More, The Buffet at Luxor on my next trip to Vegas.",

All the food was average except for the stuffing, how on earth do you mess up stuffing that bad? It tasted like cereal with gravy. It was not edible. I would think that's like a recipe 101. Personally I don't like Turkey without stuffing and the stuffing sucked so I didn't want any Turkey and I'm not a prime rib person so there was little main dishes left to eat. They had steak but I was told from others in my party it was cold and plain tasting.  However,  I should note that those in my party that do like prime rib thought that it was delicious.   It's kind of funny you get your own drinks, tea, coffee soda, and I think there is a bar if you want to order cash drinks. We tipped the waiter when we paid at the front. I'm not sure what we were tipping him for, giving us straws maybe. They might as well have us clear our own plates and put them somewhere and they will not need waiters, the prices will be even cheaper and it will be a full on cafeteria. It pretty much is anyways. Nothing wrong with the food, but nothing great about  it either. Except for that stuffing Christmas day!!!!!",

My meal actually cost an extra $300 because I left my beloved Carrera's on the table and they were snatched within 5 minutes.  I remember the food being averagely satisfying and I was constantly making trips for California Rolls. Again, remember I had been drinking all day, so most food tastes like heaven when you're hungry.

The cashier was fast and pleasant and that was the only good thing about it.  The person who seated us didn't say a word and waddled us slowly to our table.  The salad bar was not replenished and you had to dig to the bottom of each container to get anything out of it.  The food stations all served what seemed like food out of a box, nothing good at all!  This is the only buffet that they don't bring drinks to you, you have to get those yourself here.  And the desserts were all like rubber, ick!!  We had about $35 per person for this garbage!  Whomever runs this buffet needs to take a serious look at this!!  Very disappointed and don't recommend at all.",

    "text": "We came to this place on our first night in Vegas. Originally we were supposed to hit up the seafood buffet at the Rio, but we ended up going to this buffet that night. In all honesty, I was craving McDonald's that night lol, but the hubby said I was crazy and talked me into trying the buffet. I'm not much of a fan of buffets just because I don't know how long the food has been sitting out for, if its at the right temperature, especially because I've seen people stick their bare hand in the food versus using the tongs or serving spoons. We paid $50 for the both of us and I was like ok... lets see what this place has to offer.   I browsed around just to see if anything looked appetizing. My first round, I got a slice of pizza, a piece of white lasagna and a slice of some sort of roast beef. It was all GROSS!!! The pizza was so dry and cold that I didn't even swallow it, the actual pasta in the lasagna wasn't cooked all the way and was still hard and the roast beef was dry and disgusting!!   Then I decided to try the crab legs (since they're my fav!!). I was sad to see they were cut in half and looked pretty crappy. I tried them anyway and was totally disappointed. I ended up saying screw it, time for dessert. I got a slice of cheese cake and some frozen yogurt with fruit. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!!!   It was a shame we had to pay so much for such crappy food. Hometown Buffet is better (and I hate HTB) I mean we did go kind of late so I don't know if the food was the last batch of the day and we just happened to get the left overs or if its just bad food period. You would think the hostess would at least say its close to closing time and they're not going to be bringing out fresh food before going in. But I guess when you're desperate for business, you forget about being courteous to your customers. As we left, I tell my Hubs, \"I told you we should've gone to McDonalds....\"  Always read reviews before trying a new place and wasting your money folks!!!",

Meats were so little. Sushi selection was ok, small. Mexican had no cheese sauce, just grated cheese. Taco meat looked dry.  Pizza crust was not fresh. Desserts selection was ok. Not impressive.

What little else I could eat consisted primarily of various low-quality salads, including some spinach I had seen at breakfast and finally lacked an alternative and had to eat at dinner.    My friend and I literally farted our way around the Luxor for that day and the next.  If your strategy at slots is to move between machines with great regularity, you'll find the fuel at More Buffet to amply supply you with enough Methane to force your hand.    I'm pretty sure that I smelled the emanations of a few fellow gamblers who had gone, the results are rather unmistakeable.  So go to More Buffet.  Then have a tee-shirt made: I was poisoned at More Buffet and all I got was this lousy tee-shirt.  Or join the team and chant a new mantra with me: \"No way More Buffet!

I'm giving this 4 Stars to bring up the average and I think everyone here is pretty harsh about the MORE Buffet, three things: 1) Its ONLY $17!   2) Its unlimited champagne and mimosas! 3) Its unlimited champagne and mimosas!  Yes, you're gonna hear about the Wynn or the Bellagio being so much fricken better blah blah blah, but you're also gonna pay more than twice as much!  Sure a BMW M3 is better than my Ford Mustang and maybe my wife's ass isn't as small and tight as Jessica Alba's(before her kid) or Angelina Jolie's(before her 12 kids), but thats just life and you enjoy what you have and can afford.    If you're objective is eat enough decent food for to last till dinner time, get drunk off your ass, and then head down to the nice pool area and bask in the sun and look at beautiful people(and some realy ugly ones) for the rest of the afternoon, then the MORE Buffet is your starting place.  Caesars has a nicer brunch for $33, but I was too hungover and quesy(AVOID the $1 Margaritas at Bills Gamblin Hall & Casino) to enjoy any mimosas or champagne.  Paris's Brunch is also really good for just under $30.  Good Bang for the Buck! :)",

Unfortunately, it only serves to bring the food at MORE up to palatable status. I have certain expectations of all buffet food... low expectations. So it's usually not difficult to exceed them. MORE was LESS than my lowest expectations.  I expected at least crab legs and prime rib. They had prime rib at a carving station, but no crab legs. Isn't there some Nevada law against buffets failing to have crab legs?   The food seemed like it had been sitting out longer than usual, although it was busy. I tried a small salad with Ranch dressing. The lettuce acted like it had been frozen at some point. The shrimp was a touch soggy, and the cocktail sauce tasted like it had been stretched with ketchup.   The turkey was ok, along with boiled potatoes, but the cranberry sauce was crunchy in places. The Ranch dressing helped with the turkey, but not the cranberry sauce.  I wanted to try the desserts and report on those, but we'd wasted 20 minutes in line waiting for a table. That pushed us almost late for the Criss Angel show, so I didn't have time for dessert. Plus, I didn't think Ranch dressing would be too good on a cheesecake.",

The CHOCOLATE MOUSSE is a petite serving of chocolatey goodness. There is also a S'MORES dessert that is warm and delicious. Other than that, Mexican sta is sub par and Asian station is a travesty. Seems like the place skimps on pricier meat options. This place is not worth a dime unfortunately.",

For the $22 dollars that they charge for their buffet they should have more of a selection. I tried the fried chicken, Italian sausage, tacos, strawberry cheesecake.

What I enjoyed the most about this particular buffet was the vast array of options available. From American classics, to Indian dishes, there was something for every palate.The Italian food was not too great, however. The  tomato sauce used in the spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna dish was bland and watery. What I did enjoy was the dessert section! The cookies were moist and fresh-tasting, as were the little brownie bites.",

Which is really cheap in my opinion since breakfast ranges around $30 elsewhere for two plates & two beverages & here it's obviously all you can eat. There is a chef that makes eggs/ omelets & eggs Benedict fresh for you! They have an extensive array of different items to choose from. French toast, pancakes, chorizo & eggs, breakfast burritos, ham, bacon, sausage, chicken fried steak, potatoes & a full breakfast fruit salad bar just to name a few!!! Beverage wise they had fresh hot coffee, OJ, chocolate milk, white milk, and more! The food was good, not spectacular (with the exception of the fresh omelets; those were so delicious) but it wasn't bad for the price! We left full & happy!",

Waffles and eggs were soggy. No waitresses so if you are out of cream for your coffee you better snatch it from your neighbors.  The price of $15.99 for lunch is low enough that you can get full with without complaining but don't look for a dining experience. So far my top two buffets are Mirage and Planet hollywood.

Seriously...this was the worst meal I have ever eaten in Vegas.  It is my own fault.  I planned a trip to Vegas and did not even care about food.  For some reason I didn't think they served horrible food in Vegas.  Wrong.  If you want great food then try restaurants (IE: Eiffel Tower, Bartolotta, Mon Ami Gabi, Bouchon, Spago, Nobu).  If you are not in the mood for restaurants and want a buffet then go for Buchannel at Caesar's or the Buffet at Bellagio.  Also, the seafood buffet is not bad at the Rio.  Whatever you do...please do not visit the Luxor Buffet.  I think they take all of the stuff that is thrown down Criss Angel's garbage disposal and recook it with grease and fake sugar.  Somehow there are tons of people there too!  I think it is a big practical joke and the punchline is 5 years away. Luxor reps will get on TV and say \"ha!  We tried to make the worst buffet imaginable and people still ate..we didn't expect that, but it was all a joke.  The real buffet is in another room.\"  Seriously...stay away.",

    "text": "Ouch - 2 stars seems a bit harsh.  We had the buffet at the Luxor on the last day of our trip for convenience as we would be leaving right after lunch. Breakfast was probably the weakest showing, with limited options and underwhelming execution.  All the standards were available: Eggs, meats, breads, potatoes, pancakes, etc.  But nothing was awesome.  I'm a big biscuits and gravy guy, so when the biscuits were small and dry and the gravy didn't have much flavor, I was bummed.  Coffee was good though :)  Lunch was a bit of redemption.  Much wider variety:  Mexican, Asian, Pasta, Greek, American, etc.  Nearly everything I tried from the lunch buffet was tasty.  I specifically recall the vegetable spring rolls being really good.  The star may have been the dessert - Chocolate Molten Lava \"cake\", which was basically a pan of chocolate cake, fudge filling, graham crackers, and marshmallow.   You can't beat the value and if you're looking to stick close to the Luxor, you could probably do much worse.",

    "text": "The MORE buffet at the Luxor is definitely not good. The price is around $30 a person which is not cheap but not as expensive as other buffets. For less you can get way better food anywhere near or on the strip.  Let me start with the environment, it is a bit outdated and the seats are not very comfortable. It appeared clean however and there is ample seating as it wasn't busy at all, which should have told me something as it was peak dinner time.  There is not really anything to write about in regards of the staff. You pay, get seated and get your own drinks so there isn't much interaction there.  Getting to the food... More like what food? The selection was HORRIBLE. It was so disappointing. They have a small carving section with turkey, sausage, beef and chicken, noting elaborate. Literally a plate of assorted sushi which at SAMs you could probably get a better platter. The sides seemed to consist of squash cooked with an Asian, Mediterranean, Mexican, & whatever else influence you can think of, and I love squash, but I love a variety of different sides to choose from even better. I think I also saw mashed potatoes and rice. They had menudo, which I got a bowl of and couldn't eat, it had so much salt I think it may have been cooked in sea water. Disgusting.  Just bad, bad all around.  If you're going to hit up a buffet here in Vegas, don't come to the Luxor. Spend your money elsewhere, it's not worth it here. Minimal selection and what they have tastes badly.",

The food used to be a great selection any time of the day - tasty, and really fresh. Now this has become a very minimal selection anytime you visit, hardly anything to choose from on the salad bar, and the same bland food served for lunch and dinner. I got the one price all day pass so I observed this. The best meal here was breakfast with which I was not disappointed and had a great selection, but the other meals sucked. They need a food makeover ASAP because the location is still nice looking. I have been visiting here since 2009 and really hope they improve!",

There is always plenty to choose from and several variations of styles as well... the food is hot and never cold... the grill station is a great touch when you want something done a certain way.... the carving station is to die for!!!! The variety of side dishes is a great way to decorate the finishing touches on plate after plate of food!!!! The fountain drinks are cold and and the bar is always ready to serve you!!!! Now for you desert lovers out there.... let me tell you..... OH MY GOD!!!! Soft moist sweet all at the same time with deserts!!!! Cookies cakes pies mmmmmmm!!!!!

I am only giving it a 3 star because it is a much better deal for the price than spending $10 on a crummy hot dog located two floors up.  Yeah, still peeved about that.  After desperately looking for something cheap to eat, and seeing that the buffet line (and everything else) at Excalibur would probably take 1 hour to get through, having a very hungry and tired 3 year old on our hands, we settled for the buffet at Luxor.  Fortunately, my husband couldn't have been happier.  The selection was not great, the food was only so so, but it was better quality than the $10 fish sandwich he had almost bought and a lot more food too.  The one saving grace of this buffet is that they must have a decent pastry chef because their desserts were a lot better than the ones we found at the Spice Market Buffet or Seasons.  We were very impressed by the desserts and had way too many of them! That and the coffee was excellent!",

I like this buffet more than the TI buffet because their food is overall more flavored and well-presented, and they also have Chef's Specials. The salad bar is also large and impressive compared to the sad buffet at TI. I downed a couple mimosas and ate mostly breakfast food (and their eggs benedict was way better than TIs). I wouldn't go back here but it is WAY more bang for the buck than other buffets so if you have to choose a cheap one, go here. Also, another downside is the crazy maze of tables and the fact that you have to wait so long to get one. I liked our happy server though - she may have refilled my mimosa more than twice now that I think about it...",

I def recommend the strawberry cheesecake even if you don't like it because OMG soooooooooooo yummy it hits the spot even with just one bite.

    "text": "We ended up here for brunch when we discovered that our own hotel expects people on vacation to be up for breakfast before 10.    2 things I did not like:  1) There is one flat price for the champagne brunch.  Whether you want bubbly alcohol first thing in the morning or not, you feel pressured to order it because you paid for it (other buffets let you pay a reduced fee if you don't need alcohol with your eggs).  2) You pay for your meal before you sit down, and the computer asks you how much you want to tip.  Umm, nothing, I haven't been waited on yet.  Unless you bring cash, there is no way to tip your waiter after you eat, so you either have to assume the service will be good or stiff your waiter.  The Egyptian decor was nice, and the food itself was fine but not memorable.  We only ate breakfast, which had all the basics like eggs, bacon, waffles, etc.  We didn't eat any lunch but it was also basic stuff, mac and cheese, potatoes, tacos.    It wasn't bad but it wasn't special, so we wouldn't bother to go back here, especially after we discovered the wonderful Bellagio buffet that only costs a few dollars more.",

We had the morning brunch at LV Hilton with lobsters, king crab...there was nothing good worth mentioning at Luxor.  To make things worse, my 1 yr old got the stomach flu 3 hrs after eating here and was vomiting/diarrhea all night for 1 week straight!!  I think she had bad, unfresh Mahi Mahi.  My husband was a bit sick as well, but he recovered quickly; toxins in a small body is detrimental!    The service was so poor, they didn't even bother to refill our drinks or take our plates.  STAY AWAY FROM LUXOR BUFFET!!  I hear Caesar's, Paris, Bellagio has the best buffet!",

We had enjoyed the Spice World Buffet at Planet Hollywood the morning before but opted to \"eat local\" Sunday morning.  What a mistake!  I don't know where Ryan T.  ate as there was NO wait service at all. The food and drinks were totally self service.   No half and half for coffee (non dairy creamer only).  An extremely limited selection with powdered scrambled eggs, frozen pastries, no egg white omelets, watered down juices, Eggo waffles, soupy oatmeal and a fruit bar consisting of  tired looking melon evoked a Days Inn free breakfast buffet rather than a $20+ Vegas Sunday brunch.The shrimp looked so old no one in my party dared take anything from the fish area (lox and two kinds of boiled shirmp)  The carvery had a Hormel type ham and a turkey breast evoking Louis Rich, but no one to cut it. It was truly pitiful.  The take away is ask to view the buffet before committing to purchasing and avoid the Luxor MORE as a breakfast option,",

I did brunch ,not a lot of food options the meat choices were only  fried chicken(very greasy)  and turkey breast which was the only good choice  at the buffet. They had a taco bar with greasy old taco meat and discusting nacho cheese sauce. I would have been better satisfied with  taco bell to be honest! Waste of $28.00.",

There's a salad and fruit bar where you could get the standard salad, fruit, yogurt, smoked salmon (cream cheese is by the bagels in the bread station) hummus, etc. The actual buffet had most your standard stuff... Only ironically I didn't see any pancakes. French toast and waffles tho. The french toast was pretty good. There's a to-order egg and omelet station plus a few varieties on the line. Bacon, sausage, and hash were your meat options on the line. And in a small \"healthy\" section chicken breast. Overall nothing blew my mind except maybe the quiche but also nothing was bad and everything was the correct temperature. Drinks are self-serve and include sodas,a couple different juices, coffee, milk and chocolate milk, and teas.   Oh and the dessert bar is kinda set off from main area but they got banana bread so it's worth a trip.",

    "text": "3.5 stars is more accurate (\"it's OK and I'm almost a fan\"), but I rounded up because, compared to other Las Vegas buffets, the dining area here is peaceful and pleasant and devoid of residual cigarette smoke (the buffet is on the floor below the casino).  As a local who has been to way too many buffets, I generally hate them all. My husband, on the other hand, loves buffets; if he could, he would ONLY eat at buffets.  He was able to convince me to try \"More\" (the official name of the buffet at Luxor), and I didn't hate it, which is saying a lot. The food was fine--edible, varied, with a few surprises. I tried a chicken curry that was surprisingly spicy, in a good way. And I was surprised to find a chickpea stew and some other Mediterranean-influenced dishes.  What I liked best, however, was the sense of personal space that I felt once I brought my food to our booth. The spacing between tables is generous, and there's lots of room to navigate when getting up to check out the food. For once, I felt as if I was dining at a buffet, rather than just diving into a feeding frenzy. And the dining area seemed relatively quiet--Las Vegas quiet, meaning that the general din was low-grade and not overly obvious.  My mother would say I'm \"damning with faint praise,\" which I essentially am, but it still amounts to praise: I find eating at buffets an excruciating experience; they are generally loud, crowded, dirty, and nerve-wracking. But if you're on the southern end of the Strip and you need to eat, \"More\" isn't a bad choice. It's much more pleasant than, say, eating at the Bellagio buffet, where the food is better but the crowds and noise are absolutely awful.",

    "text": "With buffets like Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan and Bucchanal at Ceaser's, buffets like this one can't compare...  My family and I used to eat here often... when it used to be upstairs. Ate here a few more times when they moved it downstairs... unfortunately, it seemed like the quality had gone down a bit. For the price, it's not all that bad, but then, you get what you pay for. Most recently, I came here for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We had a buy one get one free deal so at $20 for both of it, it was a much better deal than going to other places. Even without the deal, $20 for Sunday champange brunch is much cheaper than most other hotels. At the high-end buffets, you are looking at $30-40 a head.   Anyways, there was much more people here than I thought seeing the bad reviews and not having eaten here for many years. I do think that the buffet is much better than the likes of Old Country Buffet, Home Town Buffets, Golden Corral and other buffets of those sorts. I think the reason this buffet is reviewed so low is because it is being compared to the high-end buffets.   I only had brunch, so I can't comment on the current dinner selections. Brunch had all the basics... breakfast food and some lunch items. The had an omelet station and prime rib at the craving station. There was a Chinese food section, American food, salad, soup, and breakfast foods and dessert section. True, the food is not of the high end caliber, but you are also paying half the costs... I ate various items such as fried chicken, potatoes, has browns, sausage, prime rib, omelet, waffles, egg rolls, fried rice, and some desserts. Nothing stood out as particularly great to me... but nothing stood out as terrible either. Yes, the drinks are self serve as others have stated. Personally, I do not mind that as sometimes it's a pain to ask! I was glad I was able to get 2 glasses of orange juice at a time instead of repeatedly having to ask someone for drinks.   Would I come here again... if I had a discount... but for full price, it is a bit pricey for what you get. I'm spoiled when in Vegas, so unless I had a discount or it was comped... I probably wouldn't come here again. If you are on a budget... maybe...",

Everything is meat or contains chicken broth or beef broth, even what should normally be vegetarian, (ex: the beans and rice are not vegetarian). The desserts were somewhat decent. And the rest of the food was just ok. My husband eats meat and isn't very picky (like he eats fast food), and he thought the meat was relatively dry. It was all pretty bland, and based on how hungry we were, it should have tasted much better.   The Luxor is obviously aimed at the middle class/upper middle class crowd, so why does the buffet taste like something that would be at Circus Circus or Buffalo Bills?  Next time we might try a slightly more expensive buffet. Though we got full, this felt like a waste of money.",

My son felt awful as though he caused it and we had to damage control as a result.",

    "text": "We did Sunday brunch buffet. The food is okay,  it had pretty good variety. Their design for the free mimosas is idiotic however. The girl at the bar carded both of us the first time, okay, understandable.  I went back to get one for my husband a scant 20 minutes later, and she insisted on carding me again. I gave her some contextual clues but she refused. However, there was a gentleman ahead of me in line that also got a mimosa, but she did not card him. I watched her, and she only carded certain people. I am 45 years old, and can no longer pass for 20-anything. She actually made me go get ID. There was another lady who I saw did not have her purse, it was on the table adjacent to us, and she did not have pockets. She was probably 5-6 years older, but no carding, no making her go get her ID. She walked back with her mimosa with no issues.   The inconsistency really pissed me off more than anything else, but why do they want the bartender to card every guest, every time., for what can best be described as just over a shot glass worth of mimosas? Why don't they card you at the cashier and stamp you? Or why not give the bartender a stamp? Why in the world would you have all you can drink mimosas and require an ID check EVERY. SINGLE. TIME??????  And for the record, I had one mimosa, and even that was just over half a glass.  Stupid, idiotic design that made brunch feel like a chore rather than vacation.  Epic fail.",

He would even had some drinks ready before we asked! (We had free complimentary drinks for 2).   I definitely tipped him almost every time we went up there just because he was a great guy who knew how to make us laugh.

We chose to eat here our first day because we had been driving for 5 hours and were starving (hadn't eaten all day) we had a free buffet and decided to go anyways. If you're looking for cheap and no frills then this is it for you. It fills you up without breaking the bank. Now if you're a dessert person like me, don't expect much, out of the three buffers we went to while on vacation here, they had the smallest dessert area.",

Food on the floor everywhere.. also the place needs a good dusting lots of fuzz bunnies on the decor.

    "text": "The buffet at Luxor is somewhere I always look forward to visiting. There are no bad seats , the salad bar flows endlessly in an oval walk around setup and consists of toppings galore. I personally am a fan of the food options and make it a point to feast as much as I possibly can when I come to visit. Here is my trick I arrive very early right when the buffet opens and then I get the all day food pass they put a little wristband on your arm and you can get in all day until they close up shop, The wristband also allows you to eat at Excalibar but that's another review... And I tell you what they are not making any profit off of me in the food area I tell you I gorge myself over and over because I am in Las Vegas and that's exactly what I am here for. Who needs to gamble when you have an unlimited access food pass?  Also when you get the food past wristband you get faster entry which for a lot of people could be a good thing if you want quick and easy access to drinks and sodas and water because we all know how much water can cost and even a good glass of orange juice can be super expensive but the all day wristband also includes unlimited non-alcoholic drinks   Oh and the desserts my goodness they are delicious the selection isn't as large as some other places but what they do have is excellent especially the creme brulee it always tastes amazing  But enough about me and how much I love this place I also want to say that the customer service is truly world class, The host has always taking the time to be genuine and thoughtful. It is a great operation with a well trained staff !  Sometimes the lines can be a little long but it does help to have an mLife card, because once you make  pearl, you get dedicated entry which is a time saver.    If you come to Vegas you definitely should give this buffet a try",

My biggest issue other than the garbage I put on my plate is that servers do not bring you drinks. Essentially, there are no servers, only bussers.  I've been to buffets at other hotels and they blow this one out of the water. It almost as if the Luxor isn't even trying to compete.  Take my recommendation and pass on this buffet. The only thing you will find is sub par food, disappointment, and a large bill. If you must eat at the Luxor there are plenty of other cheaper or comparably priced options that have edible food. Visit one of those other retaurants.",

I recommend you turn yourself around and go have a freshly made breakfast at the Backstage Deli tucked in a corner of the casino floor at Luxor, near the ticket area for Criss Angel's Believe. Way cheaper, tastier, made to order, and more enjoyable.  The More buffet is 2 sided. Both sides are not quite the same. If you are still going to get the buffet, I highly recommend you head straight to the Omelet station and have the chef make you a fresh omelet because the eggs on the buffet are watery and tasteless. Then you have Brown 'n Serve sausage and bacon. Cheese blintz with blueberry sauce, apple pie filling crepes, biscuits, southern white gravy, home fries, grits, mini pancakes, french toast, corned beef hash. I tried a little of everything the first day. Much of it seems frozen/packaged/heat & serve.  Day 2 I went right to the highlights: Omelet, corned beef hash was REALLY good, add some country gravy on top, lots of bacon, and if you try something sweet go ahead and dump a ladle of the blueberry sauce on it.  Fresh fruit, salads, and mediteranean dips on the center aisle.  On weekends they use 1 side for a few more lunch style hot dishes to make it \"brunch\" plus chilled shrimp, muscles, crawfish and 2 types of sushi, one was plain cucumber, the other looked like California Roll. Go ahead and skip all that nonsense. Unless your plan is to just take an empty plate up to the chilled shrimp display and go hog wild on it. Then maybe its worth those prices....nah. Still isn't.",

At least I was hoping to find some of this since I went to the Brunch.  I had an omelet and a few sips of the mimosa before run away from this place. It says a lot about how I liked this buffet.  For the price you pay you should not have high expectations anyway. The next time I hope to remind to check the reviews beforehand.",

Every time I've been here I really wanted to like it but I really didn't. The lights are way too dim and it's very awkward.  The food is also disappointing - there isn't much selection and the food is rather dry and the sushi is not very good.  I would recommend skipping this place and going to another great Vegas buffet - like the Rio international buffet or the buffet at the Bellagio. The Luxor hotel is a great place to stay, though, and it's just disappointing that the buffet isn't better.",

Not horrible but very average and depending on where you are sitting you have to walk endlessly to your table. Not a comfortable environment either, it feels like a giant mess hall.

We got a deal through Southwest that included a free buffet everyday we were staying at any MGM property, and since we were here, we tried it out for breakfast and lunch. It is sort of in the basement, but it's cool.  They have a pretty good spread. Breakfast had eggs, burritos, sausage etc, but they also have crepes, biscuits and gravy etc. I was happy with the spread. They keep the salad bar open as well and have a few Greek dishes too.  Lunch brings out chicken, noodles, Asian food, pasta and the same Greek food.   Overall, it was filling and had enough choices. Definitely glad I tried it, but there are more buffets out there to try.  If you're staying at the Luxor, worth trying.",

We decided to go to an early dinner to still use it, but even at half price this buffet is not worth it. Truly worse than most cafeteria food.  The best thing at the buffet was stale tortilla chips with ball park nacho cheese.  There are supposedly multiple nationalities of food there, but even the American was inedible looking roast beef and cauliflower.  The salad bar looks like grocery salad that has expired, and the Asian and Mexican foods were inedible (strange enchiladas and greasy vegetables sitting under heat warmers). The only thing worth eating was the dessert bar, and even that was unimpressive.  Small chocolate cookies were labeled as tiramisu and even the soft serve ice cream was less than ideal. In a city with a lot of great restaurants, this is not worth your time or money.  You would be better off eating at a fast food restaurant than this place.",

NO long line (unlike Wynn) We went around 2.30pm - 2.45pm so we got both brunch / dinner. But believe me not a big difference in variety offood here. The big diference was  removed the eggs items for breakfasta nd added a taco bar...?? and Mahi mahi that was it.   Like the spicy tuna sushi, salad bar ok good but not great, deserts were very good. I think I liked the thuramisu better than in Wynn. good selection of deserts.   unlimited chmpaign, coffee, ice tea included.  overall decent meal for 19.99 .. if you can afford to pay  pay $20 more go to the Wynn Buffet.

    "text": "This is a review of the $14.99 lunch buffet.  More might not have the biggest selections but they cook the simple buffet entrees really well.  Most buffets only do a few things well but More does many things well.  Best Dessert (for a buffet): Creme Brulee (rare to find at a buffet) and why More The Buffet gets 5 stars when others deserve 4 or much less.  The Creme Brulee is worth the price of admission, when you have to pay close to $10 for one serving at a fancy restaurant.  I usually eat $30.00 worth of Creme Brulee when I eat at More.  Best Fried Chicken (better than KFC)...center-cut, double-breasted pieces (even KFC doen't have those premium cuts).    Best Macaroni & Cheese (like homemade)...no other buffet does this better.  Best Watermelon & Canteloupe (ripe & juicy)  Best Fish: Tilapia(well-seasoned) and Snapper  Best Pasta: Alfredo and spaghetti with meatballs...good marinara sauce.  Best Mexican station:  Spanish rice was tasty.  Best Soups: Anything chowder is good  Best Coffee (tasted like gourmet) and goes great with dessert.  Best salad bar spread.  Bottomline, you can pay $10 and eat at numerous 1 or 2 star buffets or you can pay a few bucks more and eat at a 5-star buffet.",

I'm not sure how long it will last but they have an all day pass (10AM-10PM) all-you-can-eat buffet deal for $35 per person, that means unlimited visits for 12 hours, includes unlimited house wine & beer! We ended up hitting the buffets 3 times in one day, by the last visit I couldn't even eat anymore... I was good with a soda, but my friends were drinking beer and hitting the nacho bar lol Now they didn't have any crab legs or anything but I thought it was a pretty good buffet for the price. I will list the foods that I like to eat: French toast, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages, biscuits & gravy, corned beef hash, chorizo & eggs, ribs, fried chicken, prime rib, grilled mahi mahi, tacos, nachos, baked potatoes, chili, and the most surpringly good thing was... wait for it... CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP, yes, I know! I'm thinking why would anyone waste their stomach space for chicken noodle soup at a buffet, I mean I wasn't sick with the swine flu or anything, we are in the middle of the desert, it's hotter than heck... but something drew me to the soup, and I'm glad it did, because it was the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had. If I can put it in my my pocket and take it home with me I would. The service is excellent, we had 3 different servers and all were wonderful. We will be back for MORE!",

Don't waste your money here.  Stations are empty half the time at luxe. Supposedly they have sysco when I was there, there was one plate with about 15 pieces of California roll in it and that was there sushi station. They also ran out of potstickers and other items during dinner and did not replace hem.  Dry poorly run buffet",

Be aware they ask for a tip when you pay at the beginning but you'll never see a server or busboy after your seated... you have to get your own drinks and be prepared to have a stack of dirty plates on your table if you go back for a second plate (doubtful because the food is so bad)",

We stayed at the Luxor and decided to drag ourselves downstairs to the buffet looking for some good food after a LONG Vegas Night but we were thoroughly disappointed.    Brunch is what they call it but I call it Pitiful! Runny runny eggs next to soggy bread trying to pass for French Toast. Mounds of greasy bacon and sausage and some ok pancakes. The hot syrup was the best from that section.   Elsewhere, there was mediocre Asian and Mexican food. There was a randomly placed roll of sushi next to crates of whole fruit. You mean to tell me you couldn't take the time cut the fruit up!?!?    Save Your Money....Eat Somewhere Else!!!'",

I have a routine that I keep to where I will get the all day buffet at the Luxor which also includes the option to eat at Excalibur's buffet also. The price has always been reasonable and the options plenty at both locations. It is with regret the the quality of food has diminished. They both have excellent breakfast at is still my go to for that. Lunch and dinner has nothing to offer it appears that they try to offer a variety of foods such as Italian, American, and Asian dishes and have failed miserably. I would like to see one kind of food per day with more selections I.e. Monday's American, Tuesday Asian, Wednesday Mexican, Thursday Italian, And then mix varieties Friday thru Sunday since more people stay with kids and would appreciate it. They still have the best service and I would love to see better more positive changes.",

    "text": "If you want a good buffet.... Unless you're on an insanely tight budget and just craving a buffet for the fun of variety, skip this. You'll pay double for dinner elsewhere but it will be a million times better.  On the other hand, if you're just going for a fast, four course meal: salad, soup, entree and dessert you WILL find one yummy option in each genre and be satisfied.  Most of the meats were over cooked and tough or flavorless, or both. Fried chicken was good and the chicken Marsala was too. Roast beef was \"just okay\", the horseradish sauce was weak sadly.  Mashed potatoes were kind of lumpy. Gravy had minimal taste. They only had one vegetable side that I saw, corn with onions???   Pasta dishes were blah but: shockingly they had *awesome breadsticks* and decent pizza.  Mexican station was nice. Nachos were pretty good with all the fixings. Well. Not all. They had no guacamole.  One major gripe: something insane happened to the guacamole (like maybe a kid put something weird in it) and they refused to put any more out even though the buffet was going to be open two more hours. The lady who pointed it out and a few other people nearby were obviously disappointed. It wasn't worth saving the $ on not putting more out to piss like 5 people off.   I skipped most cold/salad options as food born illness is usually found in uncooked food. My fiance tried the ambrosia salad and liked it and wasn't ill or anything.  The tomato bisque was like a jazzed up version of Campbell's but I liked it. Chicken soup was fairly pleasant as was the Mexican meatball soup.  Desserts. They ran out of the only thing I was interested in: pistachio Creme brulee and left the sign out to torture me. Running out so early in the night seems lame. Leaving the sign up to prove it is a fail.   Some cakes were dry (I'm looking at you carrot cake) and others were plushly moist (yes you hot smores lava cake).  They had good drinks (those included in buffet), Mt dew was really fizzy and had plenty of syrup to soda water ratio. Hot chocolate and coffee was available as well as milk and Pepsi products.  Overall, I wouldn't visit again because they didn't have enough well prepared meats or variety of side dishes. However, I don't regret going because we did have plenty of food to nosh on and the smores lava cake saved me from utter dessert disappointment.",

Little did we know it was steak night and they had steamed crab as well! The food was so amazing that each of us got a little from every section that they offered. Our waiter was phenomenal and treated the boys to glasses of champagne for their birthday and was very attentive with removing all of our plates and checking on us. For less than $30 this is probably the best buffet I've been to on the strip thus far!",

We found a hard foreign object in a dessert that we initially thought was a needle. We brought it to the attention of the staff and they confirmed it was a piece of packaging. We did not get a picture of it before they took it away to \"examine\" it. They did address it and refunded us a portion of our bill. Crab legs were wimpy, picture attached. Two of the chefs were arguing in front of customers. I found this to be very unprofessional and demeaning to the omelette chef. The dessert selection was large in comparison to the rest of the food selection and frankly would have been the best part of the buffet if we hadn't found a piece of hard plastic in it.",

Here at MORE the kids like the huge amount of breakfast food and the large selection of of different food that they have.   Right now I have one kid eating waffles and breakfast potatoes. The oldest is eating seafood for breakfast. He has had sushi, crab legs, and shrimp.   I had breakfast foods and before we leave I always have a salad.  They have really good salads here.   The prices are good, but my meal is always comped here. Get MyVegas and take a lot of trips to Vegas and get your Mlife card upgraded. It helps when it comes to paying for meals.   When we were at the counter to pay the guy even comped a few beers.   They are super sweet here.",

The buffet was clean; the staff worked diligently wiping, replacing, and adjusting quantity.  My table was clean.  The price was in line with usual buffets in Vegas.  The beef was just fine, tasty and easy to cut.  Grilled veges were perfect, and their placement right beside the beef was a wise.The salad bar cold shrimp were plentiful but watery. Fruit was plentiful and pleasantly displayed.  Breads were beautiful, but of the two types I tried, both were dry and hard.  Great choice of drinks including milks and 100% juice and the customer could refill. Pizza looked good, but turned out to be cool and the toppings thin with no real taste. I'm a pizza lover, I picked two different, but it was just tomato paste and basil or oregano. Yuck. I gave 3 stars only because of the blah...the routine foods.   But a Huge Negative:  to exit the buffet or to go to the rest room-a person must walk up about six stairs.  Perhaps I missed a ramp, perhaps a disabled person could exit through the entrance?",

I walked around with a plate full of mashed potatoes and was at a loss to find anything else that even looked remotely appetizing.  The one trick I think is to get the fajitas when they first come out - decide if the chicken or the beef looks OK - get some tortillas (you'll have to find them - they're hidden in the back of a station and aren't easy to reach), put on some pseudo-guac and sour cream and make the best of it.    Please...  I implore you.  Do not spend money here.  And if you get it for free, see if you can get a better offer.  I am not even sure this is human-grade food.",

We purchased the all you can eat option from 7a-10p only at this buffet.  $40 for adults 12yrs old and up  $27 for 2yrs-11yrs old  However we started our day very late and our first meal was at brunch (11a-3p) which included all u can drink mimosas.  We missed their mini pancakes (I saw the pancake maker put away) & omelette station.   All in all, we've eaten at Circus Circus & Mirage buffets (that are about the same price range) & this buffet was much better than those 2.   BRUNCH was good, your standard. Italian (pasta, pizza) Mexican (nachos, churros, etc) Chinese Food, (pot stickers, fried rice, salmon) American tri-tip, bacon, scrambled eggs, French toast, sausage) salad, cold pasta & fruit & yogurt station. Desserts: ice cream machine, cheesecakes.  Gluten free options & Full size cakes for celebrations were the only desserts behind the counter. UNLIMITED Mimosas!  DINNER mostly the same main courses with a small variety in each section. They added orange chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, turkey, fish, grilled veggies, sushi, cold cooked shrimp (peeled), an addtnl ice cream machine was opened with coconut & lychee option.  Pros: - Cleanliness (times we were there our tables & chairs/ booths were very clean) & the floors were clean and all buffet areas were clean. - Salad bar options were great and all fresh fruit & salads were green and fresh. Good salad dressings - Family favorites salad bar, bacon & eggs, pot stickers, shrimp, tri-tip (had them place on the grill after carving) desserts: coconut ice cream was delicious! Gluten free apple crumb cake & custard filled cone shaped puff pastry (not sure of exact name) cheesecakes were pretty good for buffet.  Cons: - Wish it was a 24hr wristband all you can eat. Since we started late after 12p, wish it would've ended at 12p the next day.  - I wish they had 1 more protein option during dinner  - wish salad bar had bacon pieces, cold chopped ham or turkey options to add to your salad.  All in all the whole family enjoyed their meals here and would eat here again.",

From pizza to soup to salad bar to my all time favorite the caramel cookies and ice cream at the dessert station! I walked out of here about 5 lbs heavier and I am ok with that. Our server took plates and refilled drinks as needed. They do have a bottomless alcohol package you can add to the buffet. I declined as I was already feeling good.  The Latin choices was pretty delicious. I will return when I am in Vegas again in that area.  Thank you for satisfying my hunger!  Respectfully, Bryan  Oklahoma City",

    "text": "This buffet was really disappointing for a Vegas buffet.   I wish I had thought to do a quick walk through before paying for it. The set up looks nice and there is plenty of room to sit but the food is not very good.   We tried everything from the fajitas, and sushi to the steak and potatoes. I think the mashed potatoes were probably the best thing I tried which is very sad when potatoes end up being the highlight of a buffet. There was nothing that I put on my plate that I would have gone back for seconds of. Overall, for a buffet, there really isn't a lot to choose from. It's very spread out over a long area but some carts are empty and other sections are just fillers.   We also tried several desserts. Out of everything we tried the play dough looking brownie and the strawberry cheese cake were the only things we ate a whole piece of.   I give 2 stars because we didn't get sick. That's always a plus! We also had bottomless drink passes for the bar that were worth about $25 for 2 that I earned for free. The bartenders were friendly and fast. The beer, wine and small cocktails earned a star as well.   I've lived all over the county and I've been to some really fantastic buffets so maybe I'm spoiled in my ratings of buffets but I wouldn't ever come back to this one.",

I was very excited to eat at my first Las Vegas buffet and since I was at the Luxor, I figured why not the buffet at Luxor! I came here Thursday night and the place wasn't very busy. The price was around $45 for 2 and that's not bad for a casino buffet. I'm going to be very blunt here, this buffet is not good. The service was good, the design was good, and the food was just well, not good. My first venture to the bar made me realize that this buffet doesn't actually have that many options (compared to other casino buffets), and that was big disappointment number 1. My second problem was that most of the food I picked up (meatballs, chicken, dumpling, pizza, and macaroni and cheese) was not even warm, in fact the meatball was room temperature. I'm not saying it was all bad, in fact I did enjoy the chicken, although it would of tasted much better if it was actually hot (or at least warm). The steak wasn't terrible, in fact that and the mashed potatoes were definitely the highlight of the visit (although not much of one). For dessert I did get a little mint chocolate chip cup that was pretty alright, though also not that great.   Overall, if you find yourself reading this and looking for a buffet to stop it, you should probably go somewhere else.",

At Luxor buffet, you get your own drinks...soda, water, iced tea, coffee or chocolate drink. I like the concept because I don't have to wait for the server for refills and I have the option to change drinks at any point of my meal.  It wasn't busy early dinner and yes I redeemed myVegas slots rewards, nothing wrong with that. Weekend dinner cost about $31 which for the kind of food and the quality is a bit expensive. There's nothing special with their food selection and not too many choices, I even think it was designed that way to control wastage. One way or the other we have at one point had more food than we can eat in a buffet setting. Like the crab legs...it was served on to one's plate...eat what you can finish. It wasn't the best but 2 plates wasn't bad haha!  The had a sort of kinda Mediterranean section of hummus, tabouleh, tzantziki sauce and missing the Warah Enab or the stuffed grapes leaves or falafel, kebab or shawarma ...I mean Egyptian food or at least real Mediterranean food.  It has the usual Asian/Chinese section of egg roll, orange chicken and fried dumpling. Italian section of spaghetti, fettuccine Alfredo, and pizza. Mexican section of nachos and cheese, corn, tacos, and shredded beef. They had 2 selection of soup for tonight, chicken noodle and another I can't remember. It has a decent salad bar I must say and has the prime rib, ham, and bbq rib section. The dessert section is always a section of delight for me...they can mess up some but not all dessert...always haha!  The experience wasn't bad nor good. It's ok. We won't make a special trip for it, we're just glad the place was clean.",

Anyway...I've tried every buffet several times and there are two I love: Luxor and Flamingo.   The Flamingo only serves breakfast and lunch, but the Luxor serves all three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Every time I've eaten at the Luxor the quality is the same: tasty, hot, variety.   One of the hostesses, Ida, always knows me, even when it's been a year since my last visit. She takes the time to make me feel special and is a big reason I keep coming back instead of branching out and trying new places.   The chefs are always available to answer questions. Once when there was slim pickings of a popular dish, they told me to wait a minute and brought out fresh. The point being, I didn't even have to ask.   Another time, I got there just as lunch was switching to dinner and they were taking a yummy Mac and cheese dish away. When I came up (looking sad), they took my plate and gave me some.   While there are other buffets that boast over 500 options, or world class chefs, or some other snazzy marketing ploy, the Luxor is consistent with a good price, great people, excellent food. Overall, it's the best buffet on the strip.",

I had gone here on more than occasion but never during a weekend dinner which is probably why I always thought it was relatively subpar. In all honesty, the food selection is very small in comparison to its MGM counterparts. The truly amazing part, however, is the crab legs! Man, they were so worth it.  If you're a myVegas player, you can use your loyalty points to redeem a comped lunch or dinner here. I highly recommend it since the dinner includes the weekend and costs a very few amount of points to redeem. There's a VIP/handicapped entrance which I believe is likely for those at the Mlife rank of Pearl and above, but I didn't need to use that line since it was pretty empty.   The service was great. From the cashier to the busser to the chef, they were all very friendly and courteous.   The chicken noodle soup was delicious! Definitely one of my favorite selections. Their prime rib was also better than expected but of course, there is better out there. The crab legs were incredibly meaty and very hard to open. In fact, I would argue that these legs were even better than Aria's because they also had Cajun seasoning (and plain if you're not into that).  I had to give them a 5-star review simply because out of all the buffets I've ever been to that have had crab legs, they are the ONLY ones to ever go to the back of house to get white vinegar for me. That is some amazing service!  I would definitely come back here for this very underrated buffet on the weekend and hope that you will get to experience the same thing I did!  (34/100 - 2018)",

However, after I paid $11 at Starbucks in the resort for my regular ice coffee & croissant and checked the prices at the regular cafe, $20 for a breakfast buffet didn't sound unreasonable. I'm here for the weekend, so it was an additional $3 and includes unlimited mimosas (really not bad for alcohol).   Drinks: non-alcoholic drinks are self-serve from machines. The coffee could be better, but I'm a coffee snob. The orange juice was totally fine and was nice & cold straight from the machine. They also have hot chocolate, tea, standard juices, & soda. The mimosas are served at the bar, but unlimited.   Food: First, I'm here at 8am and they're already serving dinner items like salmon and sushi and full dessert. I guess some people are still up. It just seems peculiar. I got the traditional breakfast items. They have a cook to order omelette station, but unfortunately, it wasn't cooked very well and the egg taste really salty. I did, however, love the veggie frittata! The regular eggs looked pretty sad. The breakfast potatoes are bland. Bacon's ok.   Although, except for the frittata, everything was ok/mediocre, I still feel like it's a pretty good value for the selection & considering it includes champagne or mimosas. I feel like I've paid $20 for more disappointing food. Did it change my life? Would I eat here again if I wasn't staying at the hotel? Absolutely not.",

I love the omlette bar and I dont like waiting in line so that's why we come early. There is a variety of the usual breakfast foods as well as a fruit & salad bar and a dessert station. I like how the dining area is partitioned so you can have privacy when you eat. I dislike open dining areas where everyone is in your face and watching you eat. Luxor, Bellagio and Mirage are currently my favorite places for breakfast.",

It seemed like a good deal, $35 a person for what was lunch and dinner for us. We ate lunch at the More buffet. It was no Bellagio buffet but it wasn't bad. The orange chicken was the best thing out, and it was probably the best orange chicken I've had. There were some taquitos out that looked just like the ones I have in the freezer at home for the kids. The dessert was pretty good, we had some pannacotta and creme brulee.  Overall the lunch was ok and so we were tricked into thinking that the dinner would be much the same. This was a total bait and switch on the Luxor's part as the dinner had things that tasted worse than the crappiest things I was forced to eat as a kid. The sausage was the same that they had out at lunch, I could tell because it was rock hard, and all the salad items and fried rice were from lunch. The sushi had no fish in it only cucumber. I guess because there is also a sushi place in the hotel, and don't want to compete? Not sure. The only redeeming item, the orange chicken, was nowhere to be found. I looked around and all I saw was disappointment. Overall, the dinner food tasted like failure and wasted money. Oh, and I almost forgot, the little hostess woman sat me and my husband at the smallest table, when there were open booths, and we are fairly tall. The paramedics were there treating some lady when we arrived as well; should have taken that as a sign and gone elsewhere. Why don't I ever read yelp BEFORE I blow my money? Much gross So waste Such disappoint  Wow",

We went for the breakfast sitting of the buffet, it's hard to do breakfast wrong, but well this was pretty gross.  The food quality was poor. We'd waited in a fairly long line and it was clear people had come in for the breakfast sitting but at 11am they stopped breakfast, closed the omelette station despite the long line and apparent demand for breakfast.  The staff were very friendly and attentive, but the lack of variety and poor food quality garners the low rating - especially in a city known for its buffets.  I felt bad for going on about how amazing Vegas buffets were to my boyfriend and then this to be his first experience of one. Luckily this was made up for with a later visit to Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan.  Save your money and avoid More at the Luxor. If it's the convenience factor (we were staying at the Luxor) you're better off buying an overpriced muffin and Starbucks coffee, it'll be a lot more enjoyable!",

Big mistake on my part. Over scrambled eggs, rubbery pancakes,  dry waffles, bland sausages. Maybe I picked the wrong things but just seemed all over poor quality for a meal that's usually hard to mess up.

I agree this is not the best buffet in terms of variety and perhaps quality to a certain extent but for its price I would consider that the food here was A-OK.  Well, I can't speak for breakfast or dinner but we ate here for lunch. My partners-in-crime and I were able to have a military discount which knocked off about three dollars off of our meal. Make sure you ask and let the hostess know that you're military or else she won't honor it.  Not much of a variety compared to other hotel buffets that I have been to. Average food here, but not as bad as many of the other reviewers are making it out to be. To me, you get what you pay for and you should have known what you were getting yourself into for its lower end price (by Vegas standards at least). The price for lunch was about $16.00.  My favorite was the BBQ pulled pork and the alfredo pasta. The oreo cheesecake was delicious as well. The food was not terrible and I would consider eating here again. The good outweight the bad overall.",

At the very least it deserves three stars, because compared to many other buffets in the area, this one isn't all that bad! It's a clean buffet with a good variety of foods and desserts! My favourites have to be their grilled beef steak and roast beef! Of all the food choices, The Latin section was pretty good! They had this beef flank steak which was So good! They had a good variety of seafood including crab, shrimp, and mussels, but they weren't that great (not a seafood type of guy)! I also tried out the made to order pasta, and I found it to be worse than cafeteria pasta. Overall, this buffet is pretty good, and is definitely worth the price!

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I got the all day buffet for free, and normally it runs $38. And free food always tastes anywhere from 2-2.5x better than food you pay for.   Our first day in Vegas we hit up the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, so needless to say More at Luxor was a step down...literally because the place is located in the basement of the Luxor. That said, it is easily the best food I've ever eaten inside of a basement.   If you stick to the normal food here, it's hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day.   There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn't swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg \"burrito.\" I don't know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn't anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn't have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy.   For dinner, it's pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but  there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I've never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds.   The pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called \"Flavorless.\" That's More's pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels.   The Chicken - I don't know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of \"The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin\" but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be.   So all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you're spending the full $26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra $14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo's Paradise Buffet for the same price.",

Our schedules left us doing nothing that night, so we all unanimously agreed with a simple \"F*ck it\" and took the trip that night. I still think back on that weekend, it was one of the best vegas trips of my life.  My lowest point was the morning of, we woke up and decided to get a breakfast brunch. We stayed at the Luxor, and considering the temperature outside was between \"Melting your face\" and \"Heat Stroke time\", we didn't want to travel far. We got to the buffet and it was surprisingly empty. We got our table, overpaid our buffet meals because it was a hallmark holiday *Mother's Day* and tried out the food. The food was pretty bad.   Yeah there you go, I give great detail into the background about how we got there more than the food. I mean what do you expect from me?   The food sucked, pasta was bland, the international foods were crap, the desserts were ok, and the ham was awful. Why do I have to mention the ham? Because there was no meat left, and I kept telling my friends that the ham sucks so bad they loved it and turned it into a little inside joke. They keep wanting me to \"Try the ham\" at every restaurant we go because of it.   Go here if you lost money from gambling so you can feel like twice the sucker.",

Went to the breakfast area, there was a decent assortment of standard breakfast fare as well as a 'design your own omlete' area. The line for omlettes was ridiculously  huge. Pretty much everything we put on our plates tasted pretty institutional and plain. The grits was the only thing that was actually good. Definitely don't think it was worth $16. I think there should be a half price option for those that do not want an omelette .",

I suggest going to Golden Corral or Fresh Choice. The food is likely better and about half the price. Go there instead.  Beyond this, the interior was a dismal cross between your discarded Denny's furniture from the mid 1990s, the interior decorator of a pyramid and the lighting expert of a haunted house.",

The food that was out was okay, nothing stood out as yum, but nothing stood out as blegh. I guess that's what we're all aiming for these days.  The bad:  They ran out of nearly everything. Keep in mind, I was there at the beginning of dinner and that really shouldn't be a problem.   I felt like the ceiling was going to just fall down. And why the hell is it so gloomy and dark in there? I get it, we're in a pyramid, but I'm trying to eat, not feel uncomfortable.  They sat us right next to the kitchen door, even though there were plenty of tables and we asked to be seated elsewhere.  Still, you're better than Excalibur. Give yourself a high five!",

    "text": "It's not terrible, but its certainly not good. It's a bit pricey but its Vegas, and most people who come to the Luxor have money to burn. When I went, I bought an all day pass (just a wristband) for $35. This just meant I could come any time that day and eat as much as I want.  Honestly? After the first time of stuffing myself for breakfast, I ate little to nothing when I went for dinner. It's not worth it to get it if you don't think you can eat multiple times throughout the day, in my opinion. The food isn't amazing, but it is convenient if you're staying at the Luxor.  There's different foods that they classify as Mexican, American, Asian, etc. They also have a lot of desserts and soft serve ice cream. A salad bar (which I never visited).   What can you expect from a buffet? That's really all there is to it! It's a typical buffet that I could've done without. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. If I had a choice, I wouldn't choose to go here again and I definitely would not get an all day wrist band again. I recommend it for anyone who just wants convenience, and knows that this is just typical buffet food.",

For $16 a person, it is really ridiculous that there are just a handful of things from which to choose.  I dished out the most watery Cream of Wheat I have ever had.  There was not much else for me to eat.  The french toast was stale, even when I got a piece from the new tray that was being opened as I waited.  It made it too hard to chew for my daughter.  It was barely digestible to me.  There were no positives to this buffet.    And, the waitress was nowhere to be found to clear dishes for most of the meal.    If you MUST eat at a buffet on this side of the strip, Mandalay Bay and Excalibur both have more and better offerings.  Excalibur's breakfast buffet was $1 cheaper and was at least five times as good as More.  I left More in complete disgust.  I will avoid it completely in the future.",

    "text": "First off, I want to know what kind of royal buffets some of these people are going to. MORE is by far one of the best buffets I've been to.  My husband and I went for a Friday lunch. We got there about an hour and a half after they opened and we thought it was going to be busy already. We walked right up, paid and were seated. I love the layout of this buffet with all the side dining areas, I mentioned to my husband that there were a lot of people here but it was so quiet. They have it spaced out that it really reduces the noise level and you don't have to yell at the person sitting across from you.  The place was clean, we didn't see anything on the ground or food on the counters. The employees were making sure the food didn't sit, they were walking around stirring and changing out spoons. Usually when I go to a buffet I pick up a couple of plates that are still dirty and put them to the side, not once for either of us.  Our only complaint was the gentleman at the meat counter, my husband said 4 times pork sausage and the guy repeated it and then cut him a piece of turkey and was trying to hand it to him. I ended up taking, I wanted it anyways but he got an attitude when my husband told him, \"No thank you, I had asked for the pork sausage.\" Then when I came back to get another piece of turkey he was standing chit chatting with a woman and he watched me walk up and he stayed there for about 45 seconds to finish his conversation. He never greeted me and said he would be right over, just stared at me when I walked up. Very rude. Had he said he would be right over I wouldn't have taken a point away from them.  Other than that, all of the food was cooked properly, everything was presentable, everything was clean, and for the most part the employees were all nice and greeted us.",

The food was overall ok there mash potatoes were good, the meats were good I enjoyed the turkey. The desert area was pretty much empty, but again they were closing soon.

The food tasted like it was re-heated from frozen grocery stock and was either bland or cold or both.  The only thing I found that I could stomach was the fried corn (oh, and the fortune cookie because it was packaged in plastic).  I think the cooks (if you could call them that), should be forced to eat every meal there (and pay full price for it) until they realize that people shouldn't be eating this dog food.  Better yet, I would fire them all as well as the manager for being rip-off artists.",

He literally took me on a walk through of every single dish out on the floor and explained to me which dishes would fit my needs. He was knowledgable on food items permissible to my particular diet. Alongside this he had extensive knowledge of every single item on the floor. These two traits combined with his overall attentiveness and welcoming attitude made this buffet experience absolutely amazing. If you are reading this William, thank you so much! I'll be back in January   P.s. It goes without saying that the food was AMAZING especially the stir fry",

Boy, do I regret it. Very minimal selection of plain, unseasoned, cheap food. Cafeteria food at best. The meatloaf and meatballs were flavorless and had absolutely no texture, didn't resemble hamburger at all. It was like eating a flour dumplings or something. The only items that were halfway decent were the ginger soy chicken and the carrot raisin slaw. Usually dessert is my favorite part of a Vegas buffet,  but this junk was cheap, whipped cream filled horrible tasting crap. Wouldn't go back to this buffet for anything. Give me the Rio, Golden Nugget, or Gold Coast buffet anytime!",

I WAS just going to write it off as another 2-star, but then came the gas.   So. Much. Gas. And it all hit me when I was on the casino floor, so thank God I was able to get to a bathroom, lest they need to drop air freshening bombs as a result. I had more gas than a Chevron station!   Part of me thought it could have been something else, but after reading another review complaining about gas, I know that More is the guilty party.   To think the Luxor (Which in itself is a nice place) was on my bucket list. Still, I shall not venture anywhere with a buffet that causes nuclear digestive explosions, and neither should you.",

I know this place isn't aiming to be a Michelin rated restaurant, but I came here a few years ago, long enough that the MORE name was fairly new (previously it was \"Pharaoh's Pheast,\" at least that's what I hear)- Remembered it being decent, basically a step above the neighborhood Golden Corral. On this return trip, the best I can give it is \"Mediocre\". The selection was a bit underwhelming, and several items just weren't good, and that's after accounting for the fact it is a casino buffet. Some \"lowlights\"- The steaks were full of gristle, the sushi rice was gummy and over vinegared, the gratin potatoes were bland and oily, and the sweet/sour chicken basically tasted like someone cut a chicken sandwich patty into pieces and covered it with watered down generic sauce. The one bright spot was the dessert, and I'm not sure if that was just because everything else had disappointed me so. Doubly insulting was the fact we paid an upcharge due to it being NYE. I likely won't be back anytime soon, even if I got a comp. Like I said earlier, I don't expect gourmet food, just markedly better than I'd get at a chain buffet.  And somehow they failed in that. :(",

How can you go wrong there? The balance of champagne and orange juice was just right, it was great conversation with friends, and it was followed by a wonderful gambling experience.

Devoid of any flavor whatsoever!  It's a sad thing when you pay $17 and the most flavorful thing you experience is the bowl full of watermelon chunks.

Vegetarians BEWARE- you can ask the workers if there is meat in something and they will say no.  Example I asked if the egg drop soup was vegetarian, she said \"Yes\"  I said oh so it has a vegetable stock base, she said  \"no Chicken\".  Last time I checked Chickens were made of flesh.   Then at the Pasta station the only sauce they had was bolognese, I was pretty sure I saw meat in it, but  I asked anyway.  I said is that vegetarian, she said \"yes\" to which I replied so there is no meat in it.  She said \"no,meat there is BEEF in it\".  Ok so I guess Beef like Chicken is not meat...........  Hubby, the meat eater, did not like his choices either.  Our first and last time to ever eat here.",

Winter root salad, hummus and baba ganush, and various other cold foods were perfectly made.  Sea food included shrimp and mussels, they were good.  The sushi and sashimi were just ok, but probably because I eat those too much.  From the hot foods I got fried chicken and prime rib, both delicious.  I noticed the staff checking the food temperature, a plus in my book.  Some parts of the buffet I didn't sample was the Mexican food section, they had pozole and tamales but wasn't really in the mood for that.  The soup seemed to be a basic chicken noodle and another veggie soup I didn't try as well.  I did try various other Asian hot foods and they were all very good.  I ate a lot and got a single chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  Entry includes soft drinks, milk, and coffee.  Staff appeared friendly.  Overall I would definitely recommend this buffet, even at $25 I think it's a value compared to the more expensive buffets I've tried.",

The carvery could do a better job with the meat quality but that would be our only complaint. Beyond that the kids have Mac and cheese, pizza, panini, Chinese food etc etc.  Worth the try if you are nearby but wouldn't necessarily travel to it.

Reflecting back, there were no memorable dishes at all.  It was clear that inferior ingredients were used where possible to keep the overall cost to a minimum.  Even the omelet station offered up wounded omelets.  Any Embassy Suites in America has this place beat for breakfast.  Alas, there is the champagne.  Bottomless, but the quality of the champagne is hardly worth the effort.  I would have been much happier buying a bottle or two of Veuve and staying in the hotel room with my girlfriend.

    "text": "I had the opportunity to get a free Breakfast buffet with the myVegas Rewards. I got to the buffet at 9:30 am. The breakfast offerings is primarily breakfast items plus a full array of Mexican dishes which stay on the line all day. Pizza is also available at breakfast a well as through out the day. These items were all average in quality. At 11:00 am the breakfast items start disappearing and lunch fare is replaced including Fried Chicken  mashed potatoes and gravy plus the carving station is open with ham, beef and Turkey. The beef roast was excellent. The roast Turkey tasted like Thanksgiving. The fried chicken tasted like mine at home too..a Banquet TV dinner. Sushi was added and some seafood. The deserts also expanded when breakfast turned to lunch at 11:00. The bonus is getting there early for the cheaper breakfast and rolling over to lunch. As a my Vegas rewards comp it was well worth it. As a $19.99 cash breakfast not sure it's worth it..unless you roll over at 11:00.",

Bacon (cold), sausage links, eggs (powdered), potatoes, pancakes (super dry and 1 was actually hard), chicken fried steak (cold). Fruit was sliced oranges, sliced cantaloupe and sliced honeydew, oh and whole apples and bananas. Plain yogurt was really watery and bitter. We were seated in a back section that actually had no lights so it was extremely dark. The waitress/attendant came over for the first time (after we were done) and said \"it's really dark over here. Sorry, we're short staffed too\". I wasn't sure if we should tip her b/c she only saw us once AND you get your own drinks (they don't serve you drinks). But we saw her busting her hump to get the tables cleaned and turn them over quickly. Thankfully we used our M Life rewards from My Slots and got buy one get one free. Full price ($20) is not worth it for breakfast.",

There are some deserts and the selections are better than the dinner course. Wont be back",

We ate at the Luxor buffet after a wedding a couple of weeks ago and the food was so terrible that I couldn't forget to log into yelp and warn others after 14 days. The food has no flavor and I could probably count the number of food options on my fingers. I paid for 3 which included 2 adults and my 7 year old son and we were charged $98 for our meal. The \"waiter\" came by once to clear plates from our tables and the rest of the meal the entire wedding party was left to take their used plates to dump their leftover food in the trash and then to a plastic tub to leave their plates. Save your money, there are plenty of great places to eat in Vegas for half the price.",

The selection is so-so. Nothing special.   2. The quality - this is what really does this place in. Not only did just about everything have little to no flavor, but EVERYTHING was super dry from sitting out too long.   3. The women's restroom was closed the entire two hours we were there. ????  4. Atmosphere. This place is in the basement and it feels like it. It feels like a tomb. What a fun place to eat, right?  The only saving grace was their S'mores Dump Cake. I don't know how something almost magical came out of this place. It was a pretty basic chocolate cake that was absolutely smothered in hot fudge, a very think layer of toasted mini marshmallows and huge Graham crackers. Unfortunately, this one dessert, as good as it is, isn't worth the price of $18.99 and the risk that they might not have it that day.",

To top it off, chef John actually prepared several vegan dishes for us without any added cost or request. The experience left is feeling great and the food was exceptional! We ate fresh vegetables, fresh fruit and all sorts of creative dishes! I'm outdone! I will definitely return, and to top it off, we ate all food that gives life, nutrients, and protein.

They have a sign that says $35 for all you can eat all day which sounded like a good deal as well.  I paid for my meal and was seated. I noticed that the wait staff only took your plates. They didn't get your drinks. The drinks were self serve which was a plus to me but a minus in terms of their tip. When you pay they ask for the tip up front- now I see why. Fortunately I wanted to tip in cash.  Anyway, the buffet seemed huge but I'm guessing because it was breakfast a lot of the items were empty. What I did see was of the food items that were there, there wasn't actually much food to take. I was surprised being that I was in Vegas- the city of excess.  The food reminded me of hospital food. Not very flavorful and not very hot. Honestly, everything tastes like I made it at home. If you ever ate at my house you'd know what I mean, and that's not a good thing. There was no seasoning on anything. It was just bland.  There are many, many options to choose from on the strip and you definitely can find a buffet for this price or less that is much better. I would steer clear of More and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone anytime soon.",

Pizza crust was not fully cooked, asian noodles where overly salty, and the fried chicken legs where way over cooked.  The only reason we stopped at the buffet was we had some 2 for 1 comps. If I would have paid full price for the buffet we would of been asking for our money back. There are better places on the strip to eat than here.

    "text": "Honesty, I would want to give this place 1 star...but the Excalibur buffet is worse...which automatically bumps this place up to two stars....but let me tell you....it a VERY low 2 stars. NOTHING was exciting about this buffet. I do feel like I need to provide at least one positive thing, however the only positive thing I can think of is the seating arrangement. The seating is arranged so that it is not so \"Cafeteria style\". IDK if thats so much of a positive but that is the best I could do.   The food is bland, not seasoned well. Plain boring \"Comforter food\". Waaaaaaaay over priced for the food they provide. I paid $38 for the all you can eat day pass, but will NEVER do that again. It is NOT a deal if you don't like the food and don't eat it. I tried a little bit of everything (My buffet ritual) But I literally took one bite and put it down and moved to the next. I honestly don't remember taking more than one bite of anything. It was gross.  I went to McDonald's an hour later and had the best meal I had that day. And I don't even eat McDonald's. Ok so perhaps I'm being a little harsh....but to be honest, you can pay that same exact price to eat at the Wicked Spoon (BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP, Don't believe yelp it)  anyways like I was saying, you can pay the same price, and eat like a Queen or King until you are stuffed!! And you still will want to eat because EVERYTHING is so tasty, you'll be so stuffed you won't need to eat for the rest of the day. ( At least that is what happened to me on several occasions) There fore, you are pretty much paying the same price for the days worth of food, but with a better experience. \\  But bottom line, even if I were to get a free pass for this buffet, I would probably try to sell it to a foolish person for $5, take that and go put it in a slot machine. I wouldn't eat this food again if it were free, now, if I were starving...maybe...but then again,  it's Vegas...no such thing as starving....so nope...won't be eating here again EVER.   BLAH",

    "text": "giant improvement in this buffet. The lunch buffet has been  bad for some years now. But I went this passed monday and was very impressed. First and foremost they now have a carving station during lunch hours. The salad bar is huge so many good choices especially the middle eastern stuff. Just wish they put out the pita bread for the hummus and things. The choices were endless and kept bringing out more things between 1130 and 1230. good selection of self serve drinks. the bar prices are decent and of course the dessert section was awesome. Better than aria and bellagio's desserts.  the cashier was outstanding. talked to us asked how our stay is. When saw my ID saw where I was from and said has friends and family there and struck up a conversation since there was no other people in line. She was a delight. Thats how vegas was before they treated you like people not a room number.  Great value selection and service. I recommend this buffet.",

    "text": "Had to try this place for breakfast since casino's in Vegas are supposed to have awesome buffets, right?! Wrong. We went a couple years ago and thought it was adequate enough, but upon this voyage to breakfast my mind definitely changed. Nothing really tasted like anything.  Honestly, the selection was redundant. If you like semi-gross bacon (how can bacon be gross!?) sausage and powdered eggs with \"chorizo\" this place could be Eden. I say \"chorizo\" because I've had chorizo and that was not chorizo! Biscuits were somewhat stale, gravy was... gravy.... haha. Pretty much says it all!  Would be one star, but we got filled up so it can't be that bad right (wrong!)? And the chocolate milk tasted sooooo good! Not that it's great or anything special, but I hadn't had it in so long! Definitely the highlight for this meal though. Just keep in mind the ceiling for this \"high\"light is pretty low...watch your head...   Spend the $15 apiece up in the Luxor cafe instead and you'll get food that's at least marginally tastier!",

I'm not sure what they think justified the $26.99 price tag (we had our meals comped, fortunately); it would be a questionable call at $16.99, honestly.  It is the worst buffet I've ever experienced.  The meat was low quality across the board  and the desserts are poorly conceptualized.  Pluses for chocolate milk and soft serve, but you can't base an entire meal on that.    Not disappointing per se, since the reviews are pretty miserable, so my expectations were low.  But I wouldn't eat here again if they were giving the food away.  Everything was a little depressing, like eating at the food court of an abandoned mall.  That being said, the staff is very friendly.  I feel sorry for them.  They deserve better.",

But for $22.99 you can't go wrong with this place either.... We ate here the 1st night we got to Vegas, we were staying at the Luxor so it was just convenient for us. For the price we both thought it was pretty decent. They also serve Crab legs! I will also note they were way LESS Saltier then the crab legs at the Cravings Buffet @ The Mirage (which I hated) The food was all warm, and we even arrived there with only 1 hour left to be open and they were still constantly changing out the food ( Tuesday night) It also wasn't very busy. I was impressed with the selection of food, it wasn't obviously as large as other buffets, but it was satisfying. Even the deserts were good. (as you can see by my face in one of the photos lol) We actually ate there again on our last day before going to the air port. & It didn't leave us feeling shitty or tired afterwords.  If I was trying to have a non-super expensive meal and I was pretty hungry or to lazy to leave the hotel, I would defiantly eat here again.",

The wait staff was fun and helpful, especially JR, and since we liked the food so much RJ went to get the chef so we could compliment him. Was worth the price, especially with the mimosas.",

But our lovely attendant kept refilling our mimosa flutes within a minute of being empty. She was funny and perky, and we left her a nice tip.  We spent an hour or so just walking back and forth to try to force feed ourselves $20 worth of crappy food, which was very hard. But all the boys in my party seemed to be in heaven as they piled their plates high with fried everything. I tried a bunch of things but they were all very cafeteria quality. The only things I enjoyed were the shrimps and cocktail sauce, which I stuffed my face with, and the mashed potatoes.   Oh well, lesson well learned. But thank you to our wonderful waitress!",

This was a very good deal! We came here twice that day and easily ate our $70 worth. I probably ate the weight of my head in shrimp cocktail.   Highlights:  -salad bar is fresh and very good  -shrimp cocktail is delicious  -the selection of food is impressive, some type of dish from every continent  -the house wine is included and was surprisingly good  -value  -service was good   Lowlights:  -decor is a bit dated  -the food is only slightly above average tasting  -the sushi looks dangerous  Overall, a very good deal.

It was better than the Flamingo buffet and If I remember correctly slightly cheaper.  There is less variety than many of of the other nicer buffets, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Just a warning there were no Alaskan crab legs or that many choices for shellfish, only the cold shrimp they have at every buffet.  Here is something new I tried for the first time tho, asking the cashiers to take a look at their buffet, before actually choosing where to eat.  They actually allow you to do that, so I thought that was awesome. If they're not looking you might be able to sneak some bread or cookies out in your purse haha, while previewing. JK!",

    "text": "My husband and I ate at the Luxor last night and it was horrible. It was $19.99 per person for dinner. There was no crab legs, nothing special. They had breaded calamari, but the calamari was no more than 1/10th of it. You could pull apart the calamari (it looks like onion rings) and its all breading. I don't understand how this luxorious hotel/casino buffet think that people are not going to notice.  They did have prime rib, but half of it was covered with fat. Their sushi was absolutely amateur. I was impressed that they had creme brulee, but they didn't even bother to caramelize the sugar on top. All in all, I think it's only one step up from HomeTown Buffet because their food was actually hot when we showed up at 9 and they had a lot of freshly made condiments. That's all.  Oh, and watch out for the staff!  Their waitress was rude! This blond older lady came by and asked me what drink I wanted and what my husband wanted (who was still getting his food from the buffet).  I told her my drink and told her I didn't know what he wanted. Then she said to me, \"Well, you guys keep disappearing so I'll just come back later.\" She said it in a rude irritated tone. There was no need for that. She could've said, \"Oh, well I'll just come back in a little bit so I can get both your drinks.\" I think she realized my shock so she game back and asked what he usually gets and she came back with 2 drinks for each of us. When I thanks her she replied, \"Yeah.\" Back in her irritated rude voice. I was so upset that we didn't tip her, which is sad for her because my husband and I at least tip 20%.  Don't bother with More! Their logo is, \"Less is not more. More is more. More\" Yeah, more waste of money and more disappointment.",

    "text": "I'm kind of surprised that people didn't rate this buffet higher??  Maybe it's because I don't really like chicken / other meats... but love seafood.  For a 16 dollar champagne brunch, I'd say this place was pretty good!  We had 3 dollars off staying here because we were staying in Luxor.  I would recommend just finding one of the coupon booklets lying around the hotel / maybe near the concierge to get one of these coupons if you want to save a couple bucks!  We got seated relatively quickly despite there being a line.  Since I had been craving shrimp cocktail forEVER, I went straight to the seafood, and was very satisfied!  I had SO much shrimp / smoked salmon to my heart's content.  After that, I opted to get some salad, of which they had MANY varieties.  After making my own salad, I decided to go for their seafood pasta salad which was SO FUCKING GOOD.  I would literally come back to this buffet just to eat their seafood salad.    Since I was pretty hung over, I did not take advantage of the champagne brunch that much.  I think I had half a glass.  But had I NOT been hung over, I very well could have been by the end of the meal because I'd have gotten drunk and then gotten hung over... since we were there for so long just eating.  I wish I could tell you guys more about the other food, but I really have no idea how it was.  However, the seafood was great.  No king crab or anything like that, but it's not what you're paying for.  I came out of here feeling incredibly full, but still \"light\" and somewhat \"healthy\" and not weighed down too much.  I also sneaked some sandwiches out for later... yay!",

If u aint a big eater, then this would not be a good deal for u.   Lemme start with the food. For Brunch, there was a quite a variety. But out of everything i ate, there wasnt anything that was really good.... the only thing i liked was the yogurt with granola... BOY was i killn that!!!! For dinner, it seemed like they had some of the stuff from brunch and jus kept it for dinner. THAS SOO NAST!!!! so i really didnt eat much for dinner. Plus I was still full from that luvly yogurt and granola. Anywho, the selection for dinner wasnt even that great. I prolly woulda enjoyed McDo-Do's(McDonalds) more than that!!!!  oh and another thing, wen u get the all day buffet, u gotta wear this yellow bracelet kuz thats how they keep track of u. SO WACK!!!! i asked the lady, \"wat if i gotta shower\" and she said its water resistant...now, aint that a be-otch!!! that damn yellow paper bracelet was killn my look! And i felt like a fat@ss kuz it aint like i was wearin one of them bracelets for a club, it was a damn bracelet for a damn buffet!!!! NOW TELL ME THAT DONT SOUND FAT TO U?!!!!!!  I aint messn with this buffet no more!!!! this place should be called \"MORE(leftovers) Buffet at Luxor\"",

    "text": "Go spend your money elsewhere! This is the worst buffet I've been in Vegas so far. First off we googled times and prices for lunch and dinner and decided to go there because in their webpage it said lunch was until 4pm and was 20.99 Well we got there well before 4 just to realize their lunch buffet ended at 3 now but they just hadn't updated their page. Uuhm ok, so for dinner it was 27.99 but it said it was steak night dinner every night and since we were already there and hungry we decided to stay. Big mistake. Their food selection was very limited and worst of all there was NO steak to be found anywhere!!! We payed almost 30dlls a piece and there isn't even steak on their steak night?? I finally approach someone from the staff and ask about were the steak is and they say they'll check for me. He came back some minutes later and told me they were putting steak out now (even though it was past 4pm and they made us pay for steak dinner after 3pm) and proceeds to explain that the Chef wasn't even aware that they had changed their lunch and dinner times and he didn't even know he was supposed to be serving dinner buffet for the past hour! So we payed dinner price just to receive lunch menu and it wasn't even good! We finally were able to get some steak and we weren't impressed by it either. Overall a bad experience and waste of money. They only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because staff was nice.",

Normally you can use it both here and Excalibur, but it was two days before Christmas, and could only use it here. All day, traffic was light. Minimal lines, ample food availability.   Food quality: for a buffet? Actually pretty good. Every meal, there were hit and misses. Breakfast, pancakes were better than waffles. Scrambled eggs had good flavor. Oatmeal way overcooked. Fruit was a nice touch. Muffins were all tasty, bacon and sausage were all hits.  Lunch: today was an odd brunch deal which was out of the norm, so lots of breakfast still, no sandwiches like my son expected, but I asked our server about it and she checked and came back with a specially made sandwich just for him. Dessert were pretty good. The tiramisu was shockingly tasty. I also really liked the chicken noodle. The fried chicken was kind of eh, but wasn't terrible. Beware any rice dishes.  Dinner on a Friday was quite good. The steaks, though small, were really good. Lots of crab legs, though I didn't have any. I saw many people going to town on them. A wide assortment of tacos, lasagna, BBQ, Asian, sandwich station.   Also, from 4-6 is all you can drink beer, wine, and champagne. Go nuts! Overall, it's a buffet. Let's not forget that. It's going to be hit or miss. But we tend to feel yucky living off burgers and fried foods for several day, so it was nice to have a day of more regular meals.",

I was very surprised and happy to find a place that accommodated food allergies because you don't find places like that very often. My girlfriend has a soy allergy and was wary to eat here at first. The chef that came to help her was very cautious and patient going with her to each food station and told her which foods definitely didn't have soy. Also, if they did have it in the food, he would quickly list out alternate solutions to make the food soy-free for her. He even went to each cook and double-checked what certain ingredients went into the dishes. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name, but he made her experience less worrisome. It became what she could eat, not what she couldn't eat , which made me less worried about going to another place to eat that night. And top off the whole night, he sauteed chicken fajitas in just oil and salt/pepper for her and brought it to the table with our party. (It was equally as delicious, if not more, than what was served at the buffet)This really brought an overall great experience for us and I hope that other places will follow suit when it comes to accommodating food allergies. Thank you for a great experience!",

    "text": "This place is actually my go-to buffet in Vegas. I'm not saying it's the best ever, but for price, quality, and convenience, there's a a reason I keep coming back.   Convenience is a big plus for me. I normally stay at Mandalay Bay or the Delano, and the Luxor buffet is a really short walk away. I don't even have to leave the building since the casinos are attached. If I stayed elsewhere on the strip, I would admittedly change my go-to spot though.  Quality- I stay at Mandalay Bay and I'd still rather walk over than eat at Mandalay's own Bayside Buffet. Yes, Luxor isn't extravagant. If you're looking for king crab legs and lobster and the best cuts of steak, you're definitely going to be disappointed. Walk in knowing that this place offers the basic international fare, and you'll be satisfied.   Pricing- This place is expensive by your hometown standards, but it's not bad by Vegas standards. Plus, I always get the $40-45 all day wristband that lets you back in. If you time it right, that's at least three full meals! That's a steal in Vegas! The wristband also lets you into the buffet at Excalibur, but I believe Luxor is the better choice.  Service is usually alright, too. Even when there's a long line, the wait doesn't feel that bad, I'm usually seated within a reasonable amount of time for my group size. Everything, including drinks, is self service so you don't really have to interact with the staff. They're usually quick with picking up the empty plates on the table. There's nothing to really complain about.",

Now if we are ganna compare this with other buffets on the strip, I feel its only fair we compare dollar for dollar. Sure you may find something more down the street but NOT at this price!

    "text": "I don't mind spending money on a good buffet; however, thirty dollars for mediocre food is definitely no bueno in my book, and sadly that's what we received here. By the end of the meal I realized I paid for the vibe of the place and not the food itself.   We had to wait in line for about twenty minutes, even though multiple tables were already open. The cause of our extended wait time stemmed from two things. The first one was a family ahead of us who didn't know how to pay, didn't know what was going on, and couldn't understand what the woman behind the register was explaining to her. The second cause of the wait was the use of only one register, with a second one opening up much later.   The food was of the same standard of Hometown Buffet, and that is not something I want to pay thirty dollars apiece for. The only thing this buffet offers that Hometown does not is a wider selection of international cuisine. The buffet is broken up by ethnic regions (Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and American), with a separate section for sushi and salad, and of course the ever so popular dessert section. The best thing I tasted all night was the sausage and peppers, and even that was painfully bland. The desserts were fine, but I was hoping for something unique; something I can't find at other buffets.   The only thing this buffet has to offer that others do not is a full bar. Even though I didn't use it, and I didn't see anyone else use it, the fact that booze is served on premises is a godsend.   There are much better buffets in Vegas. My advice: Shop around before you settle.",

    "text": "At $23 for the brunch buffet, I was glad we had M-Life 2 for 1 credits. You can go to the Breakfast or Lunch buffet Mon-Fri for $19, but the weekends only offer brunch and dinner ($25). For the most part if you've been to one buffet in Vegas, you've been to them all. Unless you want to pay top dollar for the Bellagio or Caesar's, you can expect the same fare at any buffet. Having eaten at the Flamingo one day and now the Luxor, they are quite comparable.  The Buffet at Luxor is hidden away from the rambunctiousness of the casino, located on a quieter lower level. I really liked the atmosphere in here, it felt like a family restaurant on a Saturday morning rather than a noisy casino buffet. The staff were friendly and fast; this buffet allows you to get your own beverages (soft drinks, milk, coffees, teas) and on Saturday offered free Mimosas at the bar. There is a huge salad bar and then the typical eggs, bacon, sausages, biscuits & gravy. There were a couple of twists here, like made-to-order omelets, curried chicken, potato pancakes, and Eggs Benedict with salmon instead of Canadian bacon. That *sounded good, but it turns out I did not care for smoky salmon on my otherwise delicious Eggs Benedict. The chef is a master at making perfectly poached eggs, I'll give him that! The scrambled eggs were fluffy and perfect, not curdled and hard the way some buffet eggs are, and the bacon was crispy. There is a huge selection of beautiful, whimsical little dessert pastries that had some surprises inside, delighting my kids.    The whole meal was a relaxing, delicious escape from the frenetic casinos and I would definitely go back.",

It is OK, just OK, nothing remarkable, but nothing spectacular either. For the price, you can get much better off strip. MGM should kick their buffet game up a notch or three. By looking at the 2 and a half star rating, it would seem that most Yelpers agree. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",

    "text": "Since Yelp doesn't let us give half stars I'm giving it a 4 star but 3.5 stars is more accurate. We decided to come here since we were staying at the Excalibur and their buffet didn't look as good. Google reviews had higher ratings for Luxor so we decided to check it out. We initially planned to go to Caesar but found out from online forums / Yelp / reviews that the wait is 2+ hours on Thanksgiving and the price is hiked to $80/person. I can't imagine Thanksgiving food can differ that much so didn't feel like waiting that long or paying that much to check it out. The food was pretty standard for a hotel - they had an American station, Italian station, BBQ, different meat they were carving, and Mexican station. I admit it wasn't really high quality or luxury, but it was great comfort food and a good number of selections. They did have sushi which was a bit nasty and the turkey was way too salty, but everything else tasted good. We also took advantage of the free mimosas for the first 30 minutes and tried the free alcoholic eggnog after dinner started. For less than $60 for 2 people we were pretty pleased with the variety and taste. Nothing spectacular or unique but a hearty holiday dinner. The wait was only 30 minutes and I think we came at peak lunch time. Great service from attentive waiters who took your dirty plates away ASAP.",

Needless to say once I discovered this I indulged forgetting about the rest of the buffet.  If you are seeking a reasonably priced buffet with Vegas variety this is not a bad option at all. Another thing that sets their buffet aside is an all you can drink beer or wine option with your buffet.",

The food is bland and just shy of not passing for food at all.    The roast beef was like chewing bubble gum that had been smacked on for hours. It was seriously just flavorless fluff.    The pizza almost tasted like a grocery store Red Baron pizza but not as good.   The Alfredo also had no flavor so it just tasted like empty noodles.    The bread sticks were hard and had no taste as well.    If you go be prepared to waste 25 dollars.  That money would be much better spent at another dinning facility.   If this was 5 dollars for all you could eat it would still be too expensive.    This has been the only bad part of our stay at the Luxor.  Stay away from their poor attempt at cafeteria food.",

    "text": "Disappointed is the perfect word to describe the buffet.  First, we needed directions to find it. There is 1 giant sign but then you take the escalator down stairs (Basement Buffet). When we got down there we were super impressed with the decor, you truly felt like you were in Egypt at a dig site. We used Myvegas rewards to do a 2 for 1 buffet on a Sunday Dinner so instead of paying $60, we paid $30 ($27.99 plus tax) and even at $15 a person we were less then impressed.   Good: This is the first buffet I have seen curry at a buffet and it was pretty good. Spaghetti and meatballs were delicious. So was the cold mussels and the ribs. The desserts were the most impressive. Good job pastry chef.  Bad: Our buffet was more expensive because it was a steak and crab buffet. The Crab was yellow! I eat tons of crab and I've never seen it yellow. I tried both steamed and chilled and both made me worry I'd get sick if I ate it. It also feel apart (disintegrated)...might be old. Also the shell on both hot and cold, bent and refused to break (snap). Anyway, the rest of the food (besides the good) was mediocre. The bread was HARD, my husband struggled to break it. Oh and the light in the ceiling above our table kept going out then turning back on which was very annoying. I had to start timing when to take photos  To know: You have to get your own drinks.  I definitely would not pay full price and it take a TON of convincing to go back for a 2 for 1.",

    "text": "Ambiance is what this buffet steals from others.  First, let me start by saying this one is called \"More\" not just The Buffet.  To get to this location, you have to travel down to the \"basement\" level beneath the main casino floor.  Once downstairs and at the registers you are transported to a nice Egyptian theme.  From the walls to pillars, ceiling to decor, this location has an encompassing theme.  Due to the moderate pricing g and decent quality, this buffet can see quite a bit of a line, particularly during brunch hours, and Fri-Sun dinner hours.  I have yet to visit during peak seasons so I intend to update my review when that happens.  FOOD QUALITY This buffet has a handful of your standard stations, especially carving station, Italian, Asian, American.  The unique feature here is the Mediterranean and Gluten-free station.  It may not be fancy or over the top, but has a small handful of different options.  Food may not be as fresh-tasting as Aria or Bellagio's, but it is not as bland and dry as Circus Circus or even sometimes Excalibur's. I was fairly impressed with their salad and fruit section, as it was the largest of all.  One side had all salad, one side all breads, one side a mix of non-green salads (potato, macaroni, etc) and fruits, and the end closest to the registers has seafood.  This buffet may not have as exquisite seafood as some other locations, but for the price paid, you really can't expect much more and it is still fresh quality.  Your standard drinks are self-serve, but like with Mirage, there is a bar available for purchase, and the unlimited drinks deal is very worth it!  STAFF The staff at this location is friendly, but not over the top.  They are fairly quick to clear your table of old dishes, as it seems each server is assigned to a smaller section of tables than some of these other buffets.  They are very polite, and I have noticed when confronted with a lack of space to pass through, they take the extra step and instead of simply standing aside for you, they will either engage in very small talk to ease the tension, or will stop, turn, and go a different direction.  I am not sure if this is all intentional and psychological, or if it is just a random chance to witness, but it is something that I saw that I don't see at other buffets.  Serving station staff tend to engage with patrons a bit more and will give the basic salutation and thanks.   At the carving station, the person did make smaller comments like \"great choice!\" Or \"fantastic option, it's really good!\" These small comments go a long way, and I think other carving stations can learn from this!  ALL IN ALL You get a bit more than you pay for, but if you are expecting the over the top experience then it may be best to spend the extra to go for a top of the line like Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal, Bellagio, or Aria.  With this buffet, pricing is decent, food selection and quality is above average, and staff may not be over the top, but are respectful and pleasant to converse with.",

A small sampling of the following: Chicken Marsala, spaghetti and meat ball, General Tzo chicken, fried rice, fried won ton, chow mien, ginger chicken. Except for the Ginger Chicken the all the rest was awful. Chicken was rubber, pasta overdone, meatballs horrid. Sadly although it looked good the Caesar salad had absolutely no flavor. So for dinner I had Spinach salad and Ginger chicken. We are staying here so we went here. My advice skip this place, you can eat better food anyplace else!  Ps. The Egyptians didn't have concrete so your decor was disappointing!",

There was more variety and it seemed that a lot of the food was more fresh and stayed warmer longer. The desserts were way better. The service still sucked...and they still expect a tip just as they did at excalibur.  I was juggling my three year old twins and asked for an extra plate and the waitress just told me to go get one off the buffet....okie dokie, no tip for you!  One thing that was disappointing was that while they did have crab claws, legs, and crawfish, half of what we got was cold and still frozen. So, with that, it got knocked down several pegs and made it not worth the trip. We MIGHT try it again next time we are here, if I happen to see a ton of rave reviews.",

    "text": "Better than expected from the reviews. We were in Vegas for a quasi-family reunion. They older generation mostly loves this place.  We found it to be a good deal with MyVegas coupons, would be of questionable value without.  Our aunt thinks the Chinese food is great but we found it to be the cheapest of the cheap.  Mexican food was hit or miss.  Went out on a limb and tried \"Hawaiian pasta salad\" which turned out to be mayonnaise-based macaroni salad with cut up grapes mixed in.  Desserts carried widely in quality, with the creme brulee being our favorite of the many we tried.  Soft serve was notable: we chose the regular (not low or non fat) and found it a cut above many other soft serves, which we attributed to the fat and the actual dairy content.  By the second round, however, it stopped tasting too good.  Of note was the small Mediterranean mezze section: hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganouj, couscous, caprese, and more.  These were all fantastic (not in situ fantastic, but definitely stateside fantastic) and by far our favorite part if both meals.  Would we go there again?  Only if our relatives dragged us kicking and screaming.  We thrive in variety and would try something different.  (Most of the food was the same lunch and dinner.  Dinner just had shrimp, mediocre sushi, crab legs and a big hunk of meat).  One final note: we never tried the tomato soup because the lid had fallen into it sideways and no one ever cleaned it up.  It looked pretty gross.",

However you could walk your open crab legs to the other side of the buffet and get them warmed up in a boiling pot of water...oooook.  Overall the buffet  food tasted bland and like things I could make better at home. Like most they have an array of international foods...but they were not good. Extremely chewy short ribs, bland pastas, over cooked prime rib, dried out breads, soggy salads just to name a few. Some items didn't look very fresh and had not been replenished.  If you wanted alcohol...luckily it was somewhat inexpensive, but you needed to walk up to the bar and pay for yourself.  The cleaning crew kept taking away all my silverware and drink cup...then leaving their dirty trays and towels on my table every time I walked away for more food. Maybe it was because I was by myself? Still annoying.  If you really want to get a True Vegas buffet experience, pay the extra money and go elsewhere. The food here was not worth it.",

I also had cranberry juice which I could not drink, it tasted like it came out of a moldy well or something. It just wasn't right.

    "text": "I wasn't expecting a lot here, but was still disappointed.  My first tip-off was when I picked up a plate at the front of the buffet and it had little crumbs of wet food and water on it....got grossed out....picked up another....same thing.  EWW.  Now I'm used to getting wet plates at buffets...not sure why that is, but it is expected.  But water AND food?!  Definitely didn't get my appetite going.  : (    We went to fill our plates and as we were walking back to our table from \"round 1\", my husband decided that our table was a little too far from all the food (he was right, it was).  I agreed and he politely asked if we could be moved to another area where most of the other people were seated.  The host kind of sighed and acted like this was the most difficult request in history, but moved us anyway.  The new table had lots of crumbs, food scraps and grease on the booth seats, as well as on the table.  YUM.  But it WAS closer to the buffet!  lol  Got settled in at the new table (after using all our napkins wiping it off) and started checking out the food we had chosen.  Nothing that I had really stood out, but most of it was edible.  They had pretty much the standard buffet fare...  -Salads (I didn't have any, but tried the hubby's seafood salad...that was surprisingly tasty) -Sushi rolls (was scared to try at a buffet....hubby did and said they were \"really good\"...I took his word for it) -Cold shrimp (passed on that too....seemed like food poisoning waiting to happen) -A couple of hot pasta dishes (the penne pasta with cream sauce and mushrooms was good) -Grilled salmon (YUCK... only ate one bite.  Too fishy smelling/tasting...salmon isn't normally like that) -Mashed potatoes & various sides (decent, basic stuff) -Chinese food (eggrolls were good...fried rice and noodle dish, not so much) -Mexican food (HELL NO) -Fried shrimp (not bad) -Lots of dessert (I got all excited because they had a TON of mini desserts...and I am the dessert QUEEN.  ; )  Problem: none of them are really any good!  BOO....)  So, we did our 2nd and 3rd rounds and tried to get as full as humanly possible to get our $19.99 worth.  As I kept walking back and forth, I noticed something else...my shoes kept sticking to the floor really badly, which was a precarious situation while carrying a full plate of food.  : (   It definitely gave me even more reason to think this place definitely hadn't been cleaned properly in a long time.    While the place was pretty gross and the food was mediocre at best, the kicker was sitting there watching the server dude chat it up with EVERY. SINGLE. TABLE. except for ours, refilling drinks when they were half empty, bringing more napkins, etc, etc....the works....all the while leaving us completely unattended and, towards the end, drink-less too.  I finally had to flag him down to ask for a refill after waiting 10+ minutes to see if he'd get a clue.  He did come grab our empty plates when we were gone at the buffet, but that was IT.  I don't know if we pissed someone off by asking (very nicely) to switch tables, or if we looked young and like we wouldn't leave a tip....I have no clue.  It was so odd and so blatant that it started to feel like one of those hidden camera situations or something!  Weird.    All I know is that we weren't treated very well here, the food wasn't worth it and the whole place needs a good scrub down.  Find another place to get your buffet on in Vegas because MORE doesn't live up to its name....",

What's IS terrible is the fact that these people are charging $22 a person for food that is not worth that price. They have crab legs so you'd figure you make up the money by stuffing your face with them but honestly the crab legs there are a JOKE. They're skinny little twiggy looking things and they're served cold. The chow mein was really weird because it was made with fettuccine noodles and didn't taste authentic at all. The fried rice was terribly overcooked. I've cooked better prime rib than the one offered here.There's just really no way that you're gonna eat anywhere near $22 worth of food. They didn't really have a variety of foods when I went either. They had many types of salads which were okay. The deserts are also okay but nothing spectacular. I liked that they had real fruit juices available by the fountain drink area. Next time I'll spend more money and head over to the Bacchanal.",

From the drinks, to the food, to everything in between.  The staff just takes away your plates.  Do not expect anything fancy here.  You will not see food items that you see at the Wicked Spoon Buffet or the Bellagio Buffet.  You get what you pay for.  I got an all day pass to be used at the Luxor buffet or the Excalibur buffet for free courtesy of MyVegas rewards.  My favorite thing that they had here would probably be the mini chimichangas or the cheesecake.  Yes, it was actually pretty good.  As for the other food, don't expect much.  :D  Update:  My friends and I came here for dinner.  They actually had shrimp and sliced crab legs.  I was not brave enough to try and though.  One of my friends ended up with a stomach ache.  But, I think Excalibur is to blame from that stomach ache, not the Luxor.    Some people say to always try things at least once.  I agree, and eating at the Luxor buffet has been checked off my bucket list.  I will not be returning here again though.",

My husband, who is a vegetarian, didn't have many options but when he saw the mac and cheese he got excited. There's nothing exciting about eating tasteless, chewy mac and cheese. The corn was soggy and tasted like it had been sitting out for 6 hours. Another friend had some steak which she said was so bad she never wants to eat there again.   It's 4:00 the next day and I'm still paying for it. Ugh.   Yuck yuck yuck!",

The kids loved it and loaded up mostly on pizza, pasta dishes and they crushed the dessert area.  The adults stuck to the crab legs, shrimp, steak, chow mein/potstickers.    Overall it served its purpose for our group.  The food was decent, kind of bland and nothing blew me away.  However, I would not eat here if my kid was not with me.",

Only cool thing about this place is the interior..as if you were in modern Egypt with stone walls. I just can't believe how far the food is to the dining area. The closest seats are still a walk away. By the time you go get your food and sit down its already cold. They do have a good variety of cuisines. But I would rather have quality over quantity, since I'm paying almost $40/person. Couldn't tell the difference between their mediterranean and chinese food. A lot of different beverage..coffee, teas, sodas, juices. Breakfast/brunch is better than their dinner menu. You can't really go wrong with pancakes and eggs right?  They do take a while to clear your table. Their desserts are comparable to those at HTB. They did have creme brulee when I was there. It wasn't too bad. Just go to Mickey D's you'll get just as full for lesser the price. :)",

First off, those of you complaining that this \"doesn't even compare\" to $60-per-person five-star buffets are hilarious.  It's one of the cheapest buffets on the strip; you get what you pay for.  If you want $60-per-person buffet quality, then you have to go to a $60-per-person buffet.  Stop being cheap.  We had a free all-day pass from myVegas.  Since this is an older \"cheap\" buffet, I didn't expect much.  I figured they'd be about on par with Old Country Buffet.  That's a good description of More.  Breakfast was the best.  Everything was fresh, though it could have been hotter.  The eggs Benedict were my favorite, though they weren't the best I ever had.  The other breakfast items were as you would expect from a buffet:  the oatmeal was overcooked, the fruit was obviously from a can, the bacon was decent -- overall everything was above average.  You'll get your money's worth from breakfast if you don't have unrealistic expectations.  Dinner was another story.  The chile relleno tasted like watery cheese; disgusting.  The beef brisket was all fat.  The chicken pot stickers were decent, but nothing to brag about.  The pesto pasta salad was still half frozen.  All in all it was like going to Old Country Buffet.  The food is edible, but nothing you'll ever brag about.  It's obvious that none of the food is made on-site, and is instead trucked in from elsewhere and reheated.  Keep your standards in line with the price and you'll be fine.  But if you're truly on a budget and need a cheap buffet, there are far better options downtown.",

Came here 'cause I was touring my friends in LA back in Sep 2011, so why not go to Vegas. After we checked in at Luxor we were so hungry, so our original plan was to go to one of the Buffet of Buffets and purchase the 24 hr pass. Unfortunately we were too tired to go anywhere and settled with what was closest to us. Unlike the 24 hr buffet from Buffet of Buffets, if you buy a day pass at Luxor (& Excalibur) the time does not go to the following day. Which was pretty lame. But being tired as we were we went ahead and purchased dinner.  So the four of us ate to our hearts content.  With little to no space left, we headed over to the desserts section. Picked some fancy looking cakes, sat down, and this is where the magic begins. I do not know how to begin to describe the wonders of the cheesecake. Even though we were so stuffed, the cheesecake was just amazing.  So fluffy, so creamy, full of awesomeness of taste.  I've had italian, french, mexican, chinese, japanese, american etc style of cheesecakes this one is on top of them all! Cheesecake factory has nothing on these. They were so simple yet so wonderful. You can get them with strawberries and jelly on top or just plain. But wow, not something I was expecting. A truly life-changing surprise!  I can only hope that when I go again, they did not make any changes.",

We waited another ten minutes in the line. Food was mediocre, for them to have just put out lunch it was cold, the veggies were soggy.

The food here wasn't as bad as prison food (though my wife makes that comparison) I do think it was comparable to low grade cafeteria food.  Very low quality and made it extremely difficult to gorge yourself :)  The line for the buffet made me think we would be getting something awesome, but it wasn't.  Instead it turned out just to be a long wait for crappy food.  On top of that we went right at the cusp of breakfast and lunch.  Now most buffets would keep some of the breakfast stuff out at least until noon.  I had the luck of waiting in line for the breakfast stuff and then just as I got the front of the buffet, they decided to consolidate all the breakfast stuff to the OTHER side of the room, so I had to wait in line again.  And of course by the time I got to the front, everything was almost gone anyway.  Annoying!  And the lunch buffet itself was just as disappointing.  I highly don't recommend this place.  Go to the Paris Buffet instead",

I've always heard about how amazing the buffets in Vegas were, and this was our first trip. Good god.   We only ate breakfast and lunch. We skipped dinner. Breakfast we ate at the Luxor. They had all of your standard fare, including terrible coffee and soggy eggs. The bacon was ok, but you could have soaked a blanket with the grease. It was probably 2 stars.   Lunch we started at Luxor; we filled our plates and started eating. Everything was so overwhelmingly terrible that we decided to just leave our plates full and walk over to Excalibur, hoping theirs would be better. It wasn't.  First, the Luxor. The best thing I tasted was the pasta salad, though I could tell that some of the ingredients were on the verge of spoilage.  The lasagna still haunts me, as it was a soggy, noodley, sickly sweet mess. It tasted like someone layered chef boyardee ravioli, then boiled the hell out of it. Ugh.   The Excalibur was somehow worse. I tried their pizza, their pork loin, the fried chicken, and their 'asain' chicken wings. The pizza was somewhat akin to Little Caesars, but think 3 day old Little Caesars heated up in a hot car. I haven't yet decided if the pork loin was tougher or drier, but I was unaware that science had advanced to the point where all taste and enjoyment could be removed from a pork product. Think pork loin cooked by a Rabbi. The fried chicken was a thigh, with literally 3/4\" of breading on the top. The bottom of the chicken was wet; not greasy, wet. And miraculously, the chicken itself was dry and overcooked. I have never had chicken this bad. ...until I tried the wings. I love wings. But these... the skin was soft and soggy, like they had cooked them in a warm bathtub. The sauce was terrible. It had a flavor somewhat akin to soy sauce, but whatever they were mixing it was remarkably off putting.   After this experience, we decided to simply accept our loss on the buffet 'deal', and go to a restaurant for dinner.  I would recommend this deal to anyone who kind of likes Golden Corral, but is off put by their fancy standards.",

The catering was done by the Hotel, set up buffet style, and was absolutely delicious.  Under the impression that the Luxor made delicious food, we decided to try the More buffet.  Waking up the next morning was difficult, once we finally got up and got decent, we were starving.  The rest of our party was still asleep, so in a frenzy we landed here.  Boy oh boy.  As you can probably tell, I am one broke ass fool, so the $34 dollars to eat all day allured me.  I knew that I would probably be eating three times a day, at a rate of at least 20 dollars a meal, so I'd be saving like twenty bucks.  Win.  Wrong.  They had free \"mimosas\" which tasted like beer and ass, in my expert opinion.  There was a chef making custom omelets, and I will admit that those were pretty good.  They also had tons of bacon, which I aint complaining about.  The rest of the food could be described as crispy, at best.  I'm not talking about the good kind of crispy either.  The french toast was hard around the edges.  Since I had, like a genius, purchased the all day pass, I had the pleasure of returning around 3 for dinner.  The enchiladas edges were all stiff and gross, like they'd been there for too long.  I tried some \"chow mein\" and the noodles just fell apart and were overall nasty.  Overall, the food was just not good.  I didn't puke or anything, but it wasn't delicious.  I mean, would you want to eat at a place where someone's review was \"I didn't puke or anything\"?  It will get the job done (as in remove your hunger pains) but that's about it.  Eat somewhere else, please.",

Now, we are definitely not food snobs, but we do love eating and appreciate good food. We couldn't understand why this place got such bad reviews. I mean, it wasn't the best food I've ever eaten, but we've been to many, many much worse buffets.  The salad bar section was definitely the best part. They had a wonderful greek selection, with tabbouleh and couscous salads (both were delicious and well-made) and hummus and babaganoush. The other assorted salads were also great; the husband loved the potato-artichoke thing.   The other foods were also good, though not up to the same standards as the salads. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef were great, but the pizza and pot stickers were on the stale side.   The dessert bar had a nice selection, with tons of little dessert shots. So cute! The tiramisu was amazing, the Oreo cheesecake and pistachio creme brulee were also favorites.   Here's a tip: forget the dinky dessert plates and grab a dinner-sized one to load up with desserts. Yeah, we probably looked like piggies, but we were able to sample just about every one of the little shots, which was fun!  Anyway, I'm sure there are better buffets in Vegas. However, if you want to stuff yourself with some pretty good food for a good price, this is your place.",

There is a reason why you can't see the food until after you pay!  The manager refunded me and you could tell he's done this countless times.  He seemed defeated.  Run!  Run far away!",

    "text": "I patronized this buffet the last time I stayed at Luxor about three years ago and I remember it being at least adequate for brunch.  However, I believe that I must have still been intoxicated from the previous night and that influenced my opinion at that time.  I was back in Vegas about a month ago and tried it again for breakfast.  This place is awful.  I made the mistake of traveling to the Wynn and eating at their brunch buffet the previous day.  There is absolutely no comparison. All that being said this is a cheaper alternative to other buffets on the Strip.  You sort of get what you pay for here.  If you enjoy waffles with a rubber like consistency,  wet runny scrambled eggs, and a pitiful fruit/salad bar then \"More\" is yours!   If you want quality take the trip up to the Wynn, Bellagio, or Caesars",

    "text": "this place sucked!  dont eat here.  although ill say the name \"more buffet\" is appropriate as when u go to thier breakfast/brunch buffet.....u want that--exactly more.  more food, more variety, more warmer foods.  what a waste of $20 bucks.  if u enjoy eating cat food and dog food, hell even lama food this is the place to be....not to mention if ur in the market for a lady (er...65+)...this is the hot spot.",

    "text": "Ugh. So gross! They hardly had a selection and advertised \"champagne brunch\" but when you get there it's $7 a mimosa and $21 for a bottle- which would have been nice to know, but the bartender let me buy a single glass and didn't even suggest the alternative!?! Crab legs are AWFUL!!! I hope I don't get food poisoning later.",

    "text": "So if you would of asked me last year about this place i would have probably given it 4 stars ONLY on the fact you use to get UNLIMITED MIMOSAS during brunch.  the food as normal is gross. i hate buffets. i think they are pig troughs. but with a large group i guess they are great. we missed breakfast and so they were in the middle of switching everything out so nothing was really ready or it was left over and cold. i must say i will probably never visit here again.",
