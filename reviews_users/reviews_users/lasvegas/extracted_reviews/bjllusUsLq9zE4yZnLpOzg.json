    "text": "I drive passed this place everyday. It used to be called something like Meat Chicks & Wieners, which might be the worst name for a restaurant ever! I was happy when it went out of business, because I was hoping something good would replace it, since it's sooo close to my house. I was very happy to drive by and see Shawarma Plus was replacing it. I am usually a fan of anything Mediterranean, but I did not expect it to be this good. It has been open roughly a month and I probably been there 10 times. It's beginning to be a routine and is definitely a go to for quick and delicious food that never disappoints. I wish I could give them 6 stars. The owner works the counter himself and seems to be a very good hardworking guy. It's local small businesses like this that put a smile on my face. I wish them great success and I'll be happy to be a regular. Oh and try the baklava, seriously!",

I have over the years eaten in several Mediterrenean restaurants nationwide.  But none compares so far to Shawarma Plus.  Their food is excellent.  The spices are just perfect and they have a killer bahklava that will definitely put others to shame.  I kid you not their food is extremely good, very healthy and very tasty.  The first time I went I bought a whole bunch of sides to take home like tabuleh, grape leaves, hummus and of course the bahklava. A couple of days after I brought my kids who were visiting from the bay area and they thoroghly enjoyed the food as well.  I rarely write reviews but this is one I am doing because I feel that Shawarma Plus is a great addition to the Las Vegas Restaurant scene... Oh and the price is right ... enjoy!

(Warning: if you eat the garlic sauce you will have some killer breath. It really adds a nice flavor to the meal so its worth it but man i wished i had a toothbrush with me at the office!) The owner was very nice, the restaurant is clean and has some cool old school arcade games. Iced tea is so good!

I went for the gyro w fries and some baklava.  Aside from my wife's version...probably one of the best in town. The gyro was good, a few too many outer pieces but nicely seasoned and doused in a great sauce. The fries as always were great, the seasoning on the outside really jazz them up, I just forgot to orelder the awesome garlic sauce I used when I had the plate....next time",

You read that correctly. It reminds me of chuckie cheese on the inside; bright neon colors, video games. All I could keep saying as I entered the door was,\"Disco-disco\" as the LED disco ball was making its rotations; all the while making zohan tag lines. I'm confident my insides are layered in a thick film of grease from the amazing minced beef inside the kibbeh. Friendly, but irritated staff made the experience all the more merry as Christmas music blazed from the speaker system. I'm a bit of a Connoisseur of arabic food and in my opinion, this place fell short of taste, flavor, and originality.",

The service is awesome, the staff always suggests things, they never had my order wrong (although it's not hard to listen and get the condiments right,) and the food is always fresh and delicious. The meats are not overly salty or seasoned, the lettuce and veggies are crisp with the tzatzki sauce. I would definitely suggest this place to the locals and the tourists. I always go here at least once every 2 weeks for my Mediterranean fix. It's a lot more affordable than the higher end places.",

I've searched and searched for great quality (as authentic as can be) Middle Eastern food since I moved to Vegas a little over a year ago and haven't found anything good; until TODAY!!!!!  My husband told me about Shawarma Plus and I was skeptical until I tried the food. I had a Shawarma sandwhich and omg it was so delicious.   I tried the garlic sauce (which is always a must) and it was fresh and you can tell that it's homemade.   I don't always eat Baklava because it's usually too sweet for my liking, the Baklava here gets 5 stars also.   To top it all off, the owner and everyone else are super nice and welcoming.  I will frequent Shawarma Plus often, that's for darn sure.   Thank you.",

I have never had pickles on my Gryo and the sauce was not thick as it should have been.  The Gyro was okay, not to my liking.  - The fries, well I didn't order fries but a salad and they were very similar to \"shoestring\" fries and cold, not tasty - The Zucchini boat -well nothing to speak on, would never try this again.   All in all, not somewhere I would entertain again, should have just stuck with Subway which is right next door.",

The menu had the usual array of menu items that you'd find at a GOOD Mediterranean restaurant, and I went for the Gyros Sandwich combo (fries and drink).  The total was about $11.   I LOVE Gyros, and I LOVE Mediterranean food. Unfortunately I didn't like what I had here.  The Gyros meat was lukewarm and cold towards the center, and the fries were ALMOST warm.  It's pretty hard to screw up a meal like this, but they seemed to manage doing it.  The dining tables had a sticky film on 'em too.  I guess they were cleaned, but the solvent or detergent they're using is either not the right stuff for the job or they're using old mop water to wipe the place down.  The day and time of my visit was Thursday, Jan 8 at 6:30pm.",

This place had it all, the pickled beets, the nice rich garlic sauce that wrecks your breath for the rest of the day and the juicy chicken. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice quick lunch. The only thing I didn't like was the owner was a little pushy. Kept trying to get me to buy more when all I wanted was a wrap. Do you want sides, NO I just want the wrap, do you want a platter, NO I just want a wrap, do you want a drink, NO I just want a wrap.

The owner really makes this place something special though. Every time I've been here he is always incredibly friendly and helpful! If you peek into the kitchen and behind the counter it's very clean and organized as well as throughout the rest of the dinning area. You can really tell he takes pride in his restaurant. Overall I have nothing but nice things to say about Shwarma Plus.",

    "text": "WOOOOOOOOOW .......... HANDS DOWN, TO THE ANGRIEST, MOST RUDEST, MOST DISRESPECTFUL HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET WHO RUNS THIS ESTABLISHMENT.   My husband and I placed an order for delivery, it added up to nearly $70 (delivery was an additional 12 or so) (money is not the issue)   - the chicken was completely dried out and the lamb wraps tasted terrible, the wrap itself was also stale and the garlic sauce was indescribably strong.    My husband called back to complain as we felt the quality of food should not warrant a price tag like this. It was the worst delivered quality food and we weren't happy, everything about it was BAD. It was the principle.   Anyway, I am posting this not only because of the quality of food but because the manager went absolutely insane when we called in to complained, he told my husband (in the most aggressive, threatening and disgusting tone) that he was F***** CHEAP, that he SHOULD NEVER CALL again, then he accused him of being  a LIAR and that he was STUPID for ordering SO much as we knew the price. He then hung up on him without any resolution!!!   Its too bad because we just moved into a new neighborhood and we order for delivery quite often.  (I'd like to believe we help contribute to our local restaurant owners)  Words cannot describe just how horrible this man was, pure aggression, and I cannot imagine having to deal with this level of customer service face to face. The thought of this man holding a sharp objects while simultaneously dealing with a dissatisfied customer sends shivers down my spine.   All I can say is, \"Don't take my word for it!\" and when it happens to you, you will know how badly we were treated!   Good Luck!",

Lunch I had the chicken Schawarma which was amazing. For dinner I tried the beef and lamb Schawarma and it didn't disappoint. The box the Schawarma plate comes in is beautiful.   The Greek salad was fresh and delicious. The hummous was creamy goodness.   Even the unsweetened ice tea is a treat. Has a unique flavor for tea but really good.

They have a bunch of other dishes under a heat lamp at the front which, if you're not familiar with the place, may look intimidating. -but I assure you it shouldn't.

    "text": "If you are reading this review trying to decide what to order, do yourself a favor and get the chicken shawarma. It's juicy and flavorful and comes with the most delicious garlic sauce. You can get it in a pita as a sandwich or on a plate, but just be sure to get that delicous sauce. You're welcome. :)   Although the chicken is my usual go to, I decided to try something different on my most recent visit. I went with the lamb shawarma plate and it was really delicous and filling. It had a generous helping of gyro meat, hummus, pita, tzatziki sauce and salad all on one plate. Think bento box. The price, $12.99, does not include a drink and one will set you back another $1.99. I think the price is right for the amount of food you get, but I wish it included a drink.   Once you order you get a number and they call you when it's ready. I was mildly annoyed when I realized that to-go orders were being sent out before dine in orders, regardless of who was there first. My buddies and I waited about 15 minutes for our food. Not a huge deal for me, but my coworker only gets a 30 minute lunch so he had to scarf it down. I am wondering what the hold up is with this place and why they are so slow in getting orders out. The meal I ordered was not anything that had to be cooked. I guess I'll file this under questions I'll never get the answers to. Oh and they have this big ass fan in the dining room, it's really called big ass fan. Anyway I was looking at it cause it's cool how big it is, and I noticed the blades are caked in dust. Not very appealing considering its in a restaurant and that dust could fall onto the tables into the food. I think someone needs to get a big ass ladder and a big ass duster and take care of that. Regardless of that, I'll likely be back.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for a quick lunch the other day. Shawarma House is a take-out style type of place with no fancy plates or silverware. That said, it actually has a pretty comfortable vibe to it.   The prices are more than reasonable, most of them between $6 and $12. I got the Chicken Shawarma Plate for $12, and it included vegetables, rice/fries/salad, chicken, hummus, and bread. What a deal!   My chicken tasted great. It was seasoned just right, didn't have too much sauce, and was still warm. The bread was thin, crispy, and oven fresh. I loved it. Overall, the food served here is much healthier than a lot of other to-go foods, and the portion sizes are great for lunch. I'm quite pleased.   The dessert is not that great. When I bought the pre-made Baklava at the counter, I was expecting it to have more of a fluffy consistency like the Turkish Baklava I have had in Germany, but it turned out to be more of a brownie-cookie consistency, more crunchy and packed rather than fluffy and light. I'm not sure if that was just a cultural difference between dishes, but one of the pieces was so hard that I had issues stabbing it with my fork. Not a fan.   I would recommend this place for healthy and affordable food-to-go or a casual lunch, but I probably wouldn't get Baklava again.",

My lamb gyro looked more like a burrito than a gyro but it was tasty.  The side of fries were good and there was a decent amount of them.    The place could be cleaner but it wasn't filthy.  The BigAss fan in the center of the room is more annoying than a comfort bringer.  The order caller is a bit rude but maybe that is part of the kitsch of this place.    I can't say I hated this place but I doubt that I will return.  There are so many other places to spend my lunch dollars.",

Rose water tea is not to be missed, unsweetened and sweetened both are refreshing. Lamb was tender, chicken seasoned with love, hummus is fresh and the roasted veggies were perfect. Atmosphere is casual and quiet. It's easy to get to right off the freeway. So worth taking a break from the busy strip and slow down a bit for a good meal. We have already planned to eat here next visit, and it's been recommended to friends.",

The food looks good and next time I will try something other than the gyro plate. Ok, time out, this \"greek\" restaurant decided to americanize the name of things such as \"grape leaves\" instead of dolmades and lasagna instead of Pastitsio.  Not sure if it is so people know what things are called or because they make it different.   The plate lunches come with hummus, pita, gyro meat, and salad type fixins for the gyro plus either fries or a salad.  Not bad for 11 dollars and change.  The food was very filling.    I was disappointed with the gyro meat.  Although they shaved it off the rotisserie machine, it was actually quite dry and crunchy.It also didn't have a lot of flavor especially on the lamb end of things.    The sauce was decent but lacking in the minty flavor I'm used to.  The pita is a very thin pita rather than thick ones associated with american gyros.  I prefer it that way.  Hopefully, they will get the message and find a way to get their meat a bit more flavorful and moister.  Still, If you are in the area, it is nice to have choices now.",

    "text": "Having sailed to the Mediterranean, I can somewhat vouch for the quasi-authentic food they serve here at Shawarma Plus. I come here on occasion and it's been fairly consistent. They do have Shawarma, and they do have plus. Lot's of plus.   The owner, a Lebanese salesman ripped right out of a jewelry store in Beirut, works the register on occasion. He pushes the kabob platter like it's going out of business, and will sell you a combo meal on anything you order by default. (be sure to speak up before hand if you prefer a' la carte)....but for real, this guy is slick. Be on your A-game when you walk in, or else you'll wake up in the next day in a shopping cart full of baklava.   Also, rose water tastes like the smell of foot powder masked by an old woman's perfume... However, the rose water iced-tea here I really enjoy. I actually get it every time I go, whether I want it or not.  The interior of the establishment has a partial arcade circa 1992,  a point of purchase counter filled with baked goods for up sell, and some newly added self-serve margarita machines. Steven Wright works the spit AND be sure to enjoy the self-serve vanilla ice cream. Always a hit.",

Also, I had the rosewater sweet tea and it was amazing! My friend had the chicken kabob plate and it was $4 off that day. One grilled chicken skewer and one of ground chicken. They were both very tasty. The service was excellent as well and they offered samples to taste. The falafal was a bit dry but it would certainly not detur me from going back.

The combo doesn't include a drink so that was an extra 2 bucks and most of the choices hadn't had the syrup changed. They also charge a dollar for a teaspoon of hummus. I will not be returning.",

The decor is really cool (they even have an old pacman table) and lots of open seating. Most of the food is laid out in several salad bar-style counters so you can inspect the food and dishes. They also have little boxes of hummus, sauces and baklava for sale.  Now, this review is just for the shawarma sandwich that I got - it came in a very thin tortilla wrap. I wasn't a fan of it, nor did I like the meager amount of meat and veg that was in it. Compared to other places in town for the same prices, this place doesn't give you as much for the same buck. I'll probably drive a bit further to my usual places to satisfy my shawarma urges.  Note: Their baklava is supposed to be really good.",

    "text": "On a vacation in vegas.  Of course I have to use yelp to help me decide on where to eat.  I chose this place today because of the 4.5 stars and the fact that I love schwarmas.  After reading all the mix reviews I placed my order to be delivered.   Once again eat24 failed me and I had to call in my order.  I ordered a chicken schwarma, a kabob plate with steak and chicken, a beef gyro and a side of falafel.  My order was taken quickly and was told to meet at the hotel lobby in 15-20 minutes for pickup. They didn't deliver till 35 minutes later but that was no biggie.  We immediately opened our bag and in it were 3 wraps and 1 Styrofoam container.  Note:  they messed up on my side order of falafel and gave me a falafel wrap.  No problem.  Ate it anyways.  It was good, but nothing wow.  The falafel wasn't crunchy like I'm used to.  Maybe because it got soften from being in a wrap.  I liked how they had a sticker to label each wrap.  We unwrapped all three wrap and noticed they all looked identical.  I expected my shwarma to be wrapped up in a different type of wrap I'm used to, instead of the pita wrap. It didn't look any different than the gyro, in fact it was exactly like the beef gyro.  So maybe they messed up and gave me a chicken gyro?? Although the sticker on the wrap said schwarma. My husband's gyro was ok.  He said the wrap was too hard, too crunchy. He was disappointed there wasn't a side of tzatziki sauce.  My chicken \"schwarma\" was ok.  The meat was flavorful but kinda salty for my taste.  There was definitely garlic in it.  I have a favorite gyro place in my hometown, and their schwarmas are THE BEST.  The meats are marinaded and sliced off and then tossed and cooked before being placed in a warm wrap.   This one on the other hand had a different type of chicken meat.  It looked like just plain chicken with garlic seasoning.  And it was a bit dry. And all our wraps were falling apart as we ate because the wrap got soggy from the inside.  The kabob plate was decent.  Both beef and and chicken were tender.  Could use a bit more flavor though.  But i just dipped the meats into the very delicious hummus.  Their hummus is on point.  I would come again only for the hummus.",

I love getting the platter because it comes with all the pickled goodies. The flavors are authentic, exactly what I'm used to. Most importantly the garlic sauce......it's the real deal people.

It's what happens to food that has endured several heating and reheating cycles which means it was probably days old.  We've encountered this several times.

The lamb was good, but it needed more sauce. The hummus and pitas were very good as well. The fries were delicious too. So for the food, all was great. Service was great too. The restaurant was another issue. The tables were sticky and the salt shaker was FILTHY. It was so dirty, I was afraid to touch it. There were supplies in the dining room and things were just generally messy. The kitchen looked clean, but a bit disorganized. I would have given this place a solid five stars if the dining room and tables had been cleaner. I'll be back for the schwarma, but I think I'll take it to go.  3-28-18 Update: Went back today. Got the Schwarma chicken again and it did not disappoint. We also got the vegetarian plate and the chicken panini. The panini was good. This was my daughter's first time having falafel and she LOVED it. It was REALLY good! The tabouleh was amazing as well. I'm going to go back tomorrow for more because now I'm craving it. We did get our order to go this time, and while we waited for our food, I noticed that filthy salt shaker again.",

I don't know where the owner is from,the restaurant was closed and I picked up my food at the front door but the food is on point. The meat shawarma was really good, tasty and perfectly done, fries extra crispy with garlic sauce amazing! Fresh pita, fresh salad and the hummus smooth and tasty.

So instantly check my husbands order, sure enough it had tomatoes.   I take it up to her and tell her I asked for no tomatoes and she claims I never told her no tomatoes on pizza, and that the wrap -doesn't have tomatoes- the epic part was when I told her \"really it doesn't\" as I proceeded to pull out tomatoes from  the wrap. Then she without apologising turned and started speaking to the chef. They replaced the wrap. Anyways doesn't make you want to dine at this place. But the food is really extremely good. They just need someone else working the tables.   She won't bring you the food out either, she just stands around. The chef actually brought the food out.",

    "text": "I am always on a hunt for a new Mediterranean place. My first visit at Shawarma Plus was a pleasant one! The staff was helpful in helping me decide what to order. Since it was my first visit and I live on the other side of town, I ordered 2 meals. What can I say? Mediterranean meals are usually health conscious to begin with anyway :)  Sides: 4/5 I ordered a side of tabbouleh and it was fantastic! It was fresh and had a great balance of flavor to it. The lentil with rice was mixed in with tomatoes and grilled onions. I wish they can balance out the ratio. It was too much lentil for my taste, and the flavor was just okay.   Gyro beef/lamb sandwich: 3/5 This sandwich came in wrapped like a burrito. The meat was thinly sliced with a mild spice to it. It came in with the traditional veggies - tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, etc. The garlic creamy white sauce was mild. I wasn't a fan of the thin pita wrapper used. To me it was dry and was served not as warm as I would like it to be despite of the nice grilled marks on it.   2 combo choice: 5/5 Oh my! This was my first try of moussaka and it was delicious! It has a great combination of lamb, spices, cheese and the custard sauce on it was the cherry on top for me! So good!  The other choice was the stuffed zucchini with beef and rice filling. This was also delicious with a mild spice marinara sauce.  I would be a returning customer for sure. They have a decent menu to choose from and I can't wait to try their deserts!",

Ive learned to skip the fries and get a drink instead as the shawarma is plenty.

    "text": "After seeing some of the reviews I must say that I am surprised.  I just finished my meal from this place and although it wasn't bad, it also wasn't right.  Let's first start off with the most important thing.... the name of the place is SHAWERMA plus.  As you know, there are many types of shawerma. I ordered the BEEF shawerma. The girl informed me that it is a combo beef/lamb. If you are familiar with middle eastern or Mediterranean food, then you know beef/lamb meat is actually a GYRO, not shawerma! I wanted to give it a chance so I ordered it. And, of course the meat in my sandwich was gyro meat. Don't get me wrong, if you want gyro meat, then it was really good. I, on the other hand, was looking for an actual shawerma sandwich.  My family member also ordered shawerma, but with chicken. Her sandwich was good, but was with garlic sauce. A correctly made shawerma sandwich is with tahini sauce. So although both sandwiches were good and full, they weren't what we were looking for. Being of middle eastern descent, I know what shawerma is.  It's funny to me that the place is called shawerma plus, but they don't make a correct shawerma sandwich.  We also ordered a side of hummus. The girl asked if we wanted pita bread with it. Of course we want pita bread, how else were we gonna eat the hummus?! And, I was charged for the pita bread. If I had asked for extra bread, then of course I should be charged, but to be charged for the regular order is ridiculous!!!! I won't even mention how expensive this place is!!!  I'm sorry to say that although the food tasted ok, it sucks that this is what they are serving people. If your menu states beef, then it should be beef. And if you call yourself an authentic shawerma place, then make actual shawerma!!",

We just came from a massage and my Mom had a very bad therapist and didn't even care for Mediterranean food at the time. She left the massage place stressed out. My poor Mommy, but her filet mignon beef kebab made up for it :) Naji (sp?) was awesome. He greeted us with such positive vibe. Gave us a history of how he evolved with the Filipino community.  The rest of us ordered chicken shawarma and some chicken moussaka. The Rose water Iced Tea was the highlight of my meal. Baklava was also good. We had a great experience and we will be back :)",

We got a gyro plate which came with a very generous amount of lamb meat, veggies, salad, and some pita. The one thing I look forward to eating when i am craving Greek is the pita, and this pita was a huge let down. It was little hard (dare I say old) pieces of pita that came cold in a bag.   Dear, warm, soft, and fluffy, pita, I missed you!   The hummus was great and the lamb was good but a little greasy. If I am craving Greek again I will probably see if the sandwiches are a little better, but I probably won't get the plate again.",

    "text": "More like \"Gyro Plus\"  I'm beginning to think I'm unlucky because, unlike most reviewers, I know what real Shawarma is, and this ain't it. Whenever I'm in a new city, I try to look for real Shawarma. Outside of CA and MI, I always fail because reviewers insist they had great Shawarma that was actually mediocre Gyro.  The similarities are that both are cooked on a vertical rotisserie, and both are typically served as wraps. Here are the key differences:  - Gyro: A Greek wrap made with processed meat (deli luncheon meat). Typical toppings are COLD tomatoes, cucumbers, Tzatziki sauce, and possibly onions. The sandwich is generally cold and shaped like a cone. - Shawarma: A middle-eastern wrap made with actual meat (beef and/or lamb) with special seasoning, and nice blob of fat on top that melts as the meat is slow-cooked. When ordered, the Shawarma is sliced down onto the griddle where it's mixed with HOT veggies (tomatoes, onions, parsley), tahini sauce, and possibly garlic sauce. The sandwich is cylindrical and is served hot. - Abomination: Some hybrid of the two made by taking a gyro and making a small substitution such as tahini instead of Tzatziki. It's typically cylindrical like a Shawarma.  Sadly, Gyro is more well-known than Shawarma, and much cheaper/easier to make (processed meat, cold ingredients). As a result, when a place advertises Shawarma (even in its name), it is typically serving either Gyro or Abomination. Some places start out serving both Shawarma and Gyro, but end up downgrading to Abomination to save time/money. The only places that serve real Shawarma are in communities where a lot of middle eastern or Armenian people live because they know the difference.  Yelp reviewers: I have nothing against those of you who fall for the fake Shawarma. I hope you read this and start to recognize the real thing. I'd love to be able to rely on Yelp to find real Shawarma one day.",

    "text": "Not good anymore...  /I deleted my other good review as it unfortunately does not hold anymore./ This place has changed and gone through new management of some sort, food quality and customer service does not meet my standards anymore. I will not elaborate on the food in this review, only the customer service to make it shorter. I went there today, ordered my usual with a side salad. The new owner/manager served me.   I asked for the usual \"toppings\" for my salad: cucumbers, onions, olives and feta cheese.  When he got to the olives, he said it would be $1 extra (which, btw, is not displayed anywhere). I told him it used to be free as any other items there since you make your own salad, he didn't seem to care (I thought to myself he's probably having a bad day or something) so I let it go and went on to the next one, feta cheese. He sprinkled a tiny amount (which is ridiculous for a Greek salad), so I asked for a bit more (this has NEVER been an issue before). He then flipped out, walked to the register and tried to change the order, he said I would have to pay for a medium salad which is like $2-3 more.   I told him I didn't want a medium salad and I'm good with the small side salad. and I was ready to leave after I got my main dish. This guy got so angry, he raised his voice and started preaching about \"what am I thinking, who am I, everything is free here??\" etc..  I politely told him that I just want my salad and go and that I thought his attitude was VERY inappropriate. He just kept going and turned red, other customers were watching the whole thing (bad for business). I couldn't believe what I've just experienced - I haven't seen anything like it in a long long time.  Needless to say, I felt offended and asked for a refund, then left.  This guy had no manners nor customer service skills. Long story short, I will NOT go to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone anymore. There are at least a dozen other Kebab places around anyway that treat you as a person and not just $$$.",

So I took everything and came back- main manager came to talk to me. I told him that we got wrong soup and showed him raw meat-first he said it was fine and then when I said it's not-he screamed on me and his face went completely red and angry. Also he said he won't give me my money back because it was just half of the sandwich. This was completely ridiculous and I made them refund my money. He was so rude and unprofessional and never even said \"I'm Sorry!!!!!!!\" Never go there if you don't want to be poised with raw meat and then yelled at.",

You order at the front then food is served to you when ready.(you do have to get your own utensils near the drink fountain). Very spacious place, clean, and quite busy depending on.   So what was ordered is the gyro with beef and lamb, gyro with chicken, cabbage stuffed rice, and  baklava. The beef and lamb were really good(would recommend for anyone)  as for the chicken it was okay. I do think it was how the chicken was made. Then again I can't really compare it to anything since it is my first time trying it out. I have tried the grape leaves stuffed with rice from a coworker, thinking that it will be the same as the cabbage stuffed rice. Nope, not at all. I can't say that I hate it but I also didn't like it either. Haha finally onto dessert. I liked it a lot. The only thing that got to me was the syrup that was added on top. It was sweet but the scent and taste of rose petal just threw me off guard. I'm not saying that it was bad, it just confused my taste buds for a bit.  I give this place an overall rating of 4/5stars just cuz it was my first time. Will be coming back to try out their other food items. ^_^",

I literally past by it just about every weekend off during my months of training going out to the Lake or Henderson. It located right off I-215 just off Decatur off ramp in small shopping mall. I always have my apprehensions about new places ones that hardly see any cars out front in the  parking lot. But I never judge a book by its cover alone.   I love my greek/mediterranean food. My usually go spot little farther away from home so was hoping that found one just as good. Shawarma only down the road for me.  I only had the Shawarma Beef Sandwich on this visit. It was awesome! I was unsure whether to get the plate or sandwich. I came for lunch went with the sandwich, All the sandwich choices you can make combo with fries/soda for $2.99. The fries really nothing special but wanted drink so like combo me up. The sandwich itself nice size so really no need for fries. Just me. The sandwich had choice between beef or lamb went with the beef. The pita bread that grilled (the bread of the sandwich) that could eat by itself with some of the hummus (one things no doubt look forward too coming back trying or take some to go). You add the beef, Tahini Sauce, Tomato, Parsley, Pickles, Onions, Sumac. All these fresh ingredients. Eat bite taste the crunch of fresh pickles, nice slices of tomato, and the sauce brings it all together. It was one of the best pita bread roll up ever for me.   The interior talk about kind of all over the place between the cartoonist logo, four arcades games spread out in the restaurant (pac-man good choice classic that never gets odd), couple widescreen up top can catch whatever spots game is on, and then have salad bar area (you can build your own salad; I saw lot of fresh great looking items choose from), hot area again you can build your own, great display of authentic greek dessert from the CLASSIC baklava and knafeh (I have no idea that this is but looked just as good as the baklava), and top it all grab-n-go area cold items like hummus to tabouleh can take home. Not in huge sizes so that nice cause just right amount not go to waste. I like that have options for everyone. They even have vegetarian dishes (not many restaurant have on there set menus).  The service was fabulous! I was asking few questions since first time but he was really nice, friendly, and not asked for better service. The prices are reasonable. No doubt plan on added Shawarma to my regular lunch spots close to home!!!",

I had the chicken shawarma, tabbouleh salad, hummus, pita bread, and gyros. Oh and don't forget the dipping sauces!!  I hope you like garlic because the garlic dipping sauce is amazing. If you're looking for amazing, great quality Mediterranean food, this is it. I can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu.",

Verona provided great service on our Baklava purchase. She took time to tell us what's in every package and packed us some honey on the side so the pastry will not get soggy.

The only thing I'll knock on and it's kind of me too is I wish their pita bread was softer, I have a hard time chewing it but my jaw isn't aligned properly so it hurt but I mean, I still ate it. I loved that the kabobs had grilled zucchini in between the chicken pieces cause most places their just all meat and I liked having a little veggie to break it up. We definitely will be back!! :3",

Two cashiers and one was on the phone while we waited, not even acknowledging us. We placed a to-go order and they started to get a little busier. We waited 40 minutes! When the cashier handed us our food he told us to call ahead next time--like its our fault we had to wait and were inconveniencing them. Worst off, the food was bland and small--not worth the wait at all. Never again, no clue how this place is so highly rated.",

FOOD: The chicken kabobs were overly dry, the hummus and ganouche was unflavorful, and EVERYTHING had salt like crazy.  The salad, rice was super salty. and i usually love heavy tasting things, garlic,spice, soy sauce.  The meal was completely substandard.  It is a fast food type mediterannean.  Far from a gourmet mediterranean chef type food.  The panini which i ordered came on a pita bread instead of french bread.  Cant get a sandwich right??  I totally regretted not ordering the mediterranean hamburger.  But i thought hey its a mediterranean restaurant so ordering med food cant go wrong right?  PLACE: in fact the place looked and felt like a fast food restaurant.  It looked like it was converted from a pizza restaurant.  The problem is the price is completely unjustified.  Our order came out to be thirty something dollars for an order or kabobs and a panini.  Even at a restaurant the pita is free for dipping on ganouche and hummus.  Here they charge.    THE LAW: like star wars, Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY in the next galaxy.  For the price and the crappy food, go to a real sit down mediterranean restaurant.  Go to maza grill.  10x better.  Really wanted to like this place.  Their marketing posters are amazing and showed some awesome food that made me go in there.  Total trojan horse.",

    "text": "Not bad! I'm becoming a fan. My friend said he always drove by the place and always wanted to try it. It's in a corner I never look at, and the font they use for their sign is thin. They do have a lot of food pictures plastered in the front of their restaurant. Can't see the inside because of it.   When I went inside, they had premade food already to be served and made into a combo for, I believe $10.99. This place seems like it's great for lunch or people on the go. I love that!  Everything looked very delicious, but I was on the hunt for kabobs!   I went to get the lamb and beef kabobs plate. It was $11.99, and it came with rice pilaf, lots of vegetables, hummus, and some pita bread.  The garlic butter it came with was intense in taste! So, I used that very lightly. The pita was warm when I got my tray, the hummus had some lemon tang kick to it that made me lick the plate, the rice was light, the salad had some sort of dressing I wasn't familiar with but was still addicting, and the best part of the whole plate were the kabobs! Both the lamb and the beef were moist, and super tender! It was cooked to perfection!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! lol. SO GOOD.   I'm going to admit, I may go here after work! I need to try other things in the menu. Thank god for closing at 9pm!   I will recommend this place to everyone!   Just don't forget, this is in a small plaza across from where popeye's chicken and a gas station  is. It's easy to miss. Corner of Sunset and Decatur.   DO IT. :)",

The lamb was coined perfectly, tender and tasty. The owner, Naji is very friendly and hospitable. Give this place a try, you will not regret it. Their baklava is amazing as well!  Updated: Love this place! Verona the cashier made some awesome recommendations, I had the combo plate with some fish and zucchini with eggplant and ground beef. It was absolutely delicious and a very generous serving. My husband finished it off for me after having his kabob platter. We will definitely return again and again!",

    "text": "This place definitely deserves 5 stars. I've had my fair share of shawarma and gyros and this place is up there.   Walked in here for my first time and was pleasantly surprised to see 3 old school arcade game machines as well as a full display case of different baklava they offer. They also have a \"grab n go\" cooler display case with an assortment of easy to grab pre-made food. Totally cool.   There were like 3 people in front of me and the lady behind the counter was doing her best as a couple of the people were asking all sorts of questions and taking FOREVER. She was knowledgable and patient though. It was almost my turn but then a lady came up to the counter asking for Togo boxes and started complaining that the chicken was dry. The lady behind the counter apologized and told the cook in back who informed her that the chicken was fresh. The customer lady continued to waste everyone's time by stating that her husbands chicken was dry too. Come on. You obviously ate it though. Calm down. She basically yelled how dry it was and stormed off. So needless to say by the time I got up to the counter I could tell the girl was over it lol don't blame her what so ever.   I ordered the gyro beef/lamb sandwich combo and asked to sub a salad instead of fries and was told I could do so without an up charge. Yes! Food was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised to find pickles in my gyro. I LOVE pickles and the gyro place I normally go to doesn't add pickles to their sandwiches so this totally won me over. The salad was excellent and the dressing was delicious. The sweet tea tastes like horchata in a weird way but it's good and I keep drinking it so no complaints there. Definitely will be coming back.",

But after unsealing it and making a mess I was able to toss the tomato and enjoy the rest of the gyro.   Delivery was faster than the estimate at lunch time on a Saturday. But the driver was a little short. I had the receipt in my hand and he said \"that's mine.\" I asked if I could get a receipt and he said \"no\" and walked out. I would have liked to at least make a copy of the one he had in his hand because it was a work place order and I needed to collect from each person. In their defense they aren't the first place to fail to provide a receipt because eat24 emails me a receipt. My only thing is I can't print from my personal email at work so it would be a lot more convenient if they'd just give me one.",

I have been in three times now for lunch, and I don't think I will be returning as I find the pricing too high for the flavor and quality of the food. The employees (owners?) constantly try to upsell as well, which is off putting.  On my first visit I got a combo platter for $8.99 as well as a side of tabouli salad for $3.99. The food was pretty good, especially the chicken with rice, which I found myself craving it a few weeks later...  Sadly, on my next visit the chicken was rather dry and the rice was very bland.  On my most recent visit I had chicken skewers, which came with salad, rice and hummus. It was the special for the day, at $9.99. The chicken was not overcooked but the seasoning left much to be desired (I probably should have requested some garlic sauce for it). The hummus and tabouli were both just ok, I have had much better elsewhere. And the pita bread was a disappointment, there is no way was in made fresh in house.   The iced tea made with rose water is delicious. If I do return, it will be for that. I would rather drive a little further and get Mediterranean cuisine  that is more to my liking than settle for subpar food.",

The chicken was dry and super salty. It's hard to taste the natural flavors of food when it's sooooo salty. I would never come here again. I was originally brought into this place because of their great marketing strategy. They have posters of delicious looking food all over the outside of the restaurant. It looked delicious and made me hungry. I am extremely disappointed. A total travesty.",

If you didn't know any better, you might have thought you were walking into a 99 cent Chinese food establishment (case full of weird pre-made food) or is it Mexican? The multi colored chairs and tables scream Fiesta. And old school video games along the wall? What?! Not really sure what this place is.   The gyro I ordered was decent sized, but it was not even a gyro. It looked like a sad burrito. The chicken inside was beyond dry and it was supposed to have tzatziki sauce in it (it didn't). It was dry and tasteless. Soggy French fries. The baklava tasted like it had been made days before, it was not fresh. Asian lady behind the counter was nice though.   This place is NOT authentic. These were not very good Mediterranean recipes. We won't be back.",

My favorite by far is the stuffed cabbage. Yum! But I think by now I've tried everything. Moussaka is also fab! I would recommend trying both. Most times we leave with a to go of baba ghanouj and pita for lunch the next day.",

I had the vegetarian plate because it has all the middle eastern goodies I love: Hummus, Baba Ganouche, grape leaves (Dolmatas to the Greeks), wonderfully thin naan bread (like a pita but lighter) flavorful tabouli, and falafel.  I look forward to going back to try the 2 hot dishes with salad or rice for $8.99.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  I think that those that wrote less than stellar reviews are the competition!  This is not your street side gyro stand, far from it.  The name should clue you in that it encompasses many dishes from the middle east not just Greece!",

The light atmosphere is enhanced by three old-school arcade machines, which is nice to have if kids are dining in with you. The menu offers the standard variety of food you expect from a place called Shawarma Plus. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. It was okay. I think the chicken could have been juicier and more flavorful, but it was decent and certainly no where near bad. I didn't care for the side garlic sauce, which was disappointing because I have had it elsewhere and loved it. I asked for a side of gyro sauce, and it also wasn't up to par as far as my taste standards go- a little on the watered down side. However, all-in-all, the meal was good, and I will definitely return.  I think the weekend hours are not great; people in Vegas want to eat in places like Shawarma Plus after 7 p.m. on the weekend.  Closing at 7 is almost a slap in the face lol. This place does deliver, and it is worth the delivery fee. They should add a chicken gyro to their menu!",

There was not one piece of fresh chicken on our whole order. Our pita bread was not warmed, like most other restaurants I've been to. I asked before I left to Make sure I had the appropriate sauces I paid for for  my meals, cashier assured us that we did. When we got to our destination we realized all of the accompanying sauces were not present.  No tahini, no yogurt, no garlic sauce! The grape leaves on the Vegetarian Plate were tasty, but they were empty! There wasn't anything stuffed inside, except for sadness. The ONLY thing we had out of the two plates that was fresh was the falafel. I could tell they had just made it. It would have tasted even better with the sauce that was intended for it.   I am most certain that we will not be returning.",

Falafel is also good.  This is a good place for a quick lunch stop, definitely better than any fast food you'll find.",

The Gyro sandwich was excellent and the grilled pita was really good. The owner was a very pleasant man and brought me a cup of vegetable soup. I'm not a big fan of veg soup but this was good. Overall, I hope this place does well as I need a go to spot for my Gyro fix and this is now it.",

Was pretty busy but seemed to get through the food line & pay pretty fast. Sat at a table until they called my number to get my Chicken Shawarma sandwich & fries. Took about 7-10 minutes for them to call our numbers which wasn't too bad considering there was quite a few people in there. Chicken Shawarma was so dry & had a lot of salt type seasoning on it that made me keep downing my water. I've had better shawarma before & would rather spend my money at those places. A nice plus was that they did bring out free samples of Baklava to try.",

However this place is well priced and the kabobs were excellent. The garlic sauce is also extremely good. Give this place a try",

    "text": "I really REALLY wanted to like the food here. The owner is very nice & the place looks nice & is clean, but the food is TERRIBLE.  I'm well versed in REAL Middle Eastern food, plus I'm a foodie. I believe that the guy I saw who came out of the kitchen to put something on a plate is the cook & he is LATINO!  People, you NEVER trust a different ethnic background to cook the ethnic food you are eating. That's cooking 101. Not unless he's a to die for real chef.  I haven't tried the lentil soup yet, so maybe it will be good, but I doubt it.   Here is what I did try:  1. Grape leaves - while the vegetable one was better than the rice one, it's not traditional. I've never had a vegetable one in my life & I've been eating grape leaves since the 80's. Even the can one I buy at Trader Joe's (called Dolmades for the Greeks) is better .   I bought 4 rice & 1 veggie. They were bland & I ended up giving it to my friend, so there was $4 down the drain.  2. The $9.99 plate consisted of moussaka & the eggplant with beef, which if I had to choose the best dish, that was it, but it was over cooked, dry & very little flavor.   The moussaka (get this) was made with CHICKEN & had pasta in it. WTH??? It was also bland.  The best moussaka I have found in all my years is at a place across from the University. Shocked me too. Expensive, but very good.  The side dish of gluten or whatever that was, was also bland. I ate most of these dishes only because I was starving & on the road, but then I felt sick afterward because I always feel sick after I eat food that isn't good.  3. The tabbouleh was disgusting. It didn't even look green, NO TASTE, no lemon, no salt, nothing. It also looked like it had been sitting there wilting for hours.  I'm a HUGE Tabbouleh lover when it's prepared properly. This isn't an easy dish to prepare, but even the box mix of Tabbouleh I used to buy was better than this.  When a Middle Eastern place is selling chicken nuggets & burgers, that's warning enough they don't know what they are doing. I of course didn't know this until I got there.   Even the pickled turnips weren't good enough for me to eat.  Why people give this place 4-5 stars is beyond me, other than to say they've never had REAL Middle Eastern Lebanese food or their sense of quality is very low.  I mean no disrespect to the REAL reviewers here (everyone knows that most reviews are fake). If you love this food, go for it, for people like me who know what good food is, you will have expectations.  I'm not trying to be a snob, but nothing irks me more than when I waste my hard earned money on food that is so bad I have to throw or give most of it away.",

    "text": "Awesome Mediterranean spot in a strip mall. I got the lamb shawarma plate (pictured) and it was all that for only $11.99!! Added a side of falafel bc you can't come to a Mediterranean place and not get falafel. Everything was so savory and delicious. The garlic sauce on the side was so flavorful I wanted to take home a container of it. The shawarma itself was perfectly seasoned and cooked. They also have fresh homemade baklava available throughout the day. Definitely worth a stop in for a quick bite. Lots of food for real cheap!!  They also have the most delicious tea brewed with rose water! Never had it before here and it blew my mind and made my tastebuds dance! Unique flavor that I will definitely be coming back for",

I ordered a chicken shawarma gyro and my fiance ordered a steak kabob plate.   The chicken shawarma gyro was horrible! The chicken was oddly sweet, the lettuce was wilted, all 5 pieces of it. There was a strange tasting garlic spread all over the bread, and it doesn't come with any Tzatziki sauce, so the whole thing was pretty dry.   The steak kabob plate was just bland. The rice has no flavor and the steak was dry and just not very good. The only good thing on this plate was the hummus and salad.   We paid $24 for food we couldn't eat. I am obsessed with Mediterranean food (I order eat it at least once a week) and I really wanted to like this place but we won't be back.",

The \"gyro\" is not only the tiniest gyro I've ever seen in my whole entire life, but it also looks like a burrito. There's such little food inside that they actually were able to close it up. The \"meat pie\", which looks like the size of a nice empanada in the menu, in reality resembles a skinny, limp... Egg roll. None this even looks appetizing in the slightest. Don't waste your money in this dump. Their customer service is also pathetic.",

It's clean and the staff is friendly but there just isn't anything special about it.   I had the falafel plate. The falafel had been ore-cooked and nit made to order. The side salads were ok but were nothing special and the sauces tasted as if they came out of a bottle or a jar.   A great hint of what to expect were the commercial giant posters of the food plastered on the windows. These are normally supplied by the food supply companies selling the restaurant pre-cooked food.   My search goes on for a great middle eastern restaurant in Las Vegas!",

I had the lamb/beef \"shawarma\" this time and boy it was very oily, yet the meat was dry and rubbery... and also not shawarma at all! This was like condensed meet or something, shawarma consists of slices or slabs of meat stacked up on a spit (much adobado or al pastor for my Hispanic friends). What they are served was like a gyro ... again not shawarma at all and not very flavorful. I will say the portions were great size even though I had to wait almost 25 minutes to get something that is being sliced off a rack that's supposed to be already cooking. I was very disappointed... again. I don't know if this place is a franchise or something but it needs to evaluate something things there. I am giving it a star because it was clean and the staff was pleasant",

The first time I ordered the Shish Kabob plate and the second time I did a combination of Chicken & Kefta plate. Both times the food was great. All of the meats I've tried were moist and tender. I love the delicious rice that is served with a grilled tomato and a grilled pepper on top. The hummus is delicious and creamy. The pita bread has been nice and soft both times. The small salad that comes in the plate has a nice tasting dressing and I won't complain about more veggies! Not necessary since the meats are already great, but they provide a garlic sauce that is delicious for dipping the meats.   The portions have been great and were enough to make two modest portions for me. You can't beat two lunches in one! Even with an upcharge for kefta the plates have come in at less than $15 which seems reasonable for the quality and quantity of food provided.",

I sent my little bro inside to grab the food, sent him in with $40 thinking that would cover it, but it was $44 and some change... so the guy ended up taking the drink off to make it $40 and still gave him the drink. I just thought that was really really nice! Shout out to that guy lol   And honestly I did think $40 was even a tad expensive for two combos with extra skewer.. but once I saw how much came in the bag I was like holy moly ok I get it! They give you enough for two meals. So basically I got 4 meals for $40 and it was all so fresh and so yummy. I did prefer the steak over the chicken, but both were flame  and the grilled pepper/tomato were my favorite things... omg yum  there were some stuffed leaf veggie roll things that I didn't order intentionally maybe it came with the combos but they were my least favorite component I honestly threw them away RIP  Eat here for good noms",

The man at the counter was very nice and told us what our options were.  We decided to get the special.  The food was swimming in oil.  I received 1 meat patty, 1 single stuffed zucchini and salad with a pile of greasy fried potatoes for $10.  I could only eat the meat patty and salad and left hungry.  My daughter had the same only with rice instead of lettuce.  She was only able to eat the patty and rice.  What little I was able to eat, I still felt grease inside my mouth and all over my lips.  I can't believe they charged us $10 for a tiny patty and zucchini.  Horrible food!",

Then we ordered the chicken kabob. This plate came with the choice of hummus, salad/tabouli, and rice. This plate was very delicious. Finally we got a Mediterranean burger. This burger was soooo amazing that it is better then most burger places in my opinion! My burger also came with fries and they were amazing! With this order we also got two drinks! He recommend the iced tea that is made there!! It was very delicious! At the end this place is really amazing and delicious!! I will be returning here!",

I took a small order of baklava home and was disappointed. It was dry as a bone and was all dough and hardly any filling.  The second time I went I had a gyro. Again, extremely dry. I bought another small order of baklava again to see if it was any better than the last time, but it wasn't. It was super dry with all phillo dough and no filling.  I gave this three stars because the one great thing about this place is the service. Nice people work there.  I'm not sure I'll go back because my two visits weren't the best. Hopefully I can find a better place. Especially for baklava.",

The owner called us personally to explain why we didn't get fries with our gyro. He was very nice, personable and understanding. This is a man who cares about his business.   I only gave it 3 stars because the food itself was just ok. I ordered a shawarma salad and added chicken. It came in a clear container with a \"Best Buy\" date sticker and a label stating what kind of salad and a price tag so I know this was not made to order. I work in a hospital so it reminded me of the cafeteria there. Baba gnoush was packaged the same as well although that was absolutely delicious. The chicken on the salad was so hard. It was like the outer part of a store bought rotisserie kind that had been shredded off and left to sit for days in the frig. I took it all off and gave it to the dog. He was happy. The dressing and salad itself was good though.   I think if he presented his food in a more fresh way his business could thrive. Cafeteria style is not attractive. Especially since we paid $33 for a gyro, tea, salad and baba gnoush that was low quality. He is a good guy though. Maybe he will read this and take some pointers from an outside perspective.",

It's very rare in this town to find someone who is equal parts of passionate about their food, friendly and over the top helpful.   I've been to quite a few places in vegas that have similar things on their menu. That, however, is the end of the similarities. The food here is outstanding. If you are looking to get your \"zankou\" cravings satisfied (for all you so-cal folks) please believe, naji's food is of a much higher quality and the flavors are a cut above any other restaurants that share similar options.   Get the garlic sauce. Put it on everything. Buy a gallon, and use it at home, you won't be sorry.   Give this place a shot next time you are headed west on the 215. Even if you think you don't enjoy this type of food, you're wrong. Grab a kebab. Try the filet mignon one. You like steak don't you? No red meat? Get chicken. You are vegan?? Well, I'm sure there is something for you too. You won't be disappointed. I'm serious.",

We don't come as often as I'd like but it is because of the higher prices .  That being said, we love the food and the service. My son spoke of how much he loved dolmas and the waiter ended up giving him a free dolma. We ended up buying a 1/2 dozen before we left. They were delicious and juicy.  Leg even let my kiddo try the rice, which he went with because he loved that also.   The beef shawarma was great. There was a bit of grease at the bottom of our platter but it was moist and I can get over that. The salads are always great. I love the dressing. I love the pickled veggies they give with the plate also. Their tzatziki sauce was yummy. At first I was disappointed because there was only a small hole filled in the plate but then the waiter surprised us by bringing on extras. Much better! I love my shawarma with that refreshing, clean flavor of yogurt and cucumber.   We ordered fries because we remembered them to be pretty darn good. They aren't homemade or anything but it is a good price for the amount of fries and they do come out nice and hot. We enjoyed them.   The hummus on our plate is so great. I love it. I think it's one of the best. My obsession their rose water tea Yep! I'm infatuated with the tea. My husband is persian so I'm aware I could just go buy rose water and make my own tea but I save this as a treat when I come to eat here.   There is nothing fancy about this place. You order and go sit down, they bring your food, and then you toss your own garbage but this place is delicious. We will pass up a few shawarma places to come to shawarma Plus.",

There were more than a few good options to pick from, and we decided to try some rice bowls.   The table we picked to sit at was a little dirty, but that might have been because we just missed the lunch rush. Lots of seating inside. The wait for the food was minimal and when it came... bam! Taste bud happiness. I had the gyro rice bowl. This is a great combo of flavors, textures, and volume. This bowl filled me up! I wish I would have saved some room because the hummus was fantastic! I could have lived off that the rest of the day!   I am looking forward to getting back so I can try out more of the menu!",

The prices charged are sometimes $3 higher per item than shown on the menu...  We ordered 2 of the shawerma plates, which says $11.99 on their menu and you can choose between chicken, beef or lamb (see my photo below of their menu). When the lady rang up my 2 entrees they rang up as $14.99. I asked why the price was so much higher, and was told that beef costs more. She said that I could switch to chicken and pay $11.99. I told her that I still wanted beef but they really needed to update their menu stating there's an upcharge for anything other than chicken.   She argued with me for a bit before I paid for my meals and left. Apparently she did not think this was considered misleading and False advertising. Shady place, not recommended",

I can only give two stars however because if your name is \"Shawarma Plus\" and your chicken shawarma taste like a grilled chicken sandwich, there's a problem. In cities that lack variety and competition with Lebanese/Levantine food you'll have these spots selling subpar shawarma.",

It was relatively easy to get to, with major cross streets of Sunset and Decatur, in a small plaza. The parking was rather difficult during lunch hour. There was limited amount of parking spots. I'd highly recommend to go before lunch or mid/late afternoon.  Inside the restaurant was clean and spacious seating. It was really cold though. The restaurant had left their door open and the weather outside was about mid-30s. Good thing I had my jacket handy!  I reviewed their menu, and it had a lot of selections! I decided to try their Chicken Shawarma Plate. After ordering it, it took about 15 minutes to complete. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but ended up bring it back with me.   I was quite surprised at the variety offered on the chicken shawarma plate. There was a small salad, rice, chicken shawarma, pita, hummus on the plate ordered. The food tasted fresh and flavorful. I was slightly disappointed though at the portion size in comparison the price paid. The plate costed approximately $15.00 with tip added on. You could find comparison food at other restaurants at around $10.00 with tip.  The food was good though! If you're looking for a Shawarma place in the Southwest of Vegas, this is a \"okay\" spot, but if you're on a budget, I'd recommend elsewhere.",

Lamb was nicely spiced and the humus was creamy. I had the 2 entree lunch and choose the salad as its side. The entrees were the chicken moussaka and the eggplant with beef. Both were good but I really liked the flavoring of the eggplant with beef. The rose water iced tea was refreshing. Authentic food shows the preparers care about the food they make and serve. Reasonable price, good size portions, free refills on drinks and good service. We will be back.     Back in town and needed some work on the motorcycle before we headed out on a week trip. Went for a late lunch on a Saturday. My husband had the lamb kabobs and I had the Falafel platter. The food was as tasty as ever. Eating at this restaurant has become the highlight of getting work done our motorcycle down the street.",

Today I walked into this dump at 8:35, as we stood in line the person at the register said that he will NOT HELP US BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSED. Correct me if I'm wrong but when your business has their operating hours published throughout this city it stands. INSTEAD AS THE PERSON AT THE REGISTER WAS TAKING AN ORDER FOR A FAMILY AHEAD OF US, HE COMPLETED THE ORDER AND TOLD MY PARTY THAT THEY ARE NOW CLOSED AND WON'T HELP US. The time stamp once reaching the register was approximately 8:40 pm which therefore does not meet the 9:00 pm \"closed\" guidelines. As we walked up to order the \"owner\" said I don't have time for you because I need to clean and close the store.  He became extremely hostile claiming he is the owner of the restaurant and can do whatever he wants. This establishment and the owner is an embarrassment to this city!! No one should ever receive this nasty treatment.  The most disgusting thing he did last was pointed to the door. Unbelievable!!!. I will NEVER COME HERE AGAIN AND WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW HOW DISRESPECTFUL-AND RUDE THIS BUSINESS AND THE OWNER IS!! Also the restaurant is filthy & will do further research in how to get the health department there to investigate because I'm sure they fail several health code NEGATIVE STARS ALL THE WAY AROUND!",

I've had many a shawarma in my life and this one was without a doubt the absolute worst. First of all, after paying $10 and waiting nearly 30 min I expected something fabulous to come out, but what I was served barely had any meat on it at all, a few pieces of pathetic looking iceberg lettuce, and a single tomato slice. It had absolutely no flavor except for old oil. The fries, which were cold and hard, also had the flavor of old oil. I will never eat here again and I don't recommend that anyone else does. So many better options.  Edit to add: I had to pick up some Pepto after eating here. Really quite disgusting.",

I wasn't that hungry today so ordered the chicken shawarma. Wrap was nice and toasted and plenty of meat. I had to order a little more sauce but after that was pretty good 4/5. Next visit I will try the lunch specials. The baklava also looked delicious!  If you are military, veteran or police you get a free regular drink.

The place was pretty empty. We got there around 7:30pm on a Monday with about an hour and half left before they closed at 9:00pm. I ordered the Shawarma plate where you could choose from either chicken or beef and lamb, a choice between fries or salad, and then some pickled vegetables. It also came with hummus and a pita bread and tzatziki. I chose the beef and lamb and fries. The portion was huge, I shared it among myself and my friend and we were both full. The beef and lamb was both flavored well, the fries were mediocre, a bit soft and not really crispy though. We asked for some ketchup and the cashier was happy to get some for us. Overall, I enjoyed my meal there and would come back to try their other dishes.   **FYI, it looked like the place isn't air-conditioned, they have big fans on their ceilings. It didnt seem hot or uncomfortable when I was there eating inside.  **Also the cashier and waitress working that night were nice enough to stay a little after closing for us to finish. We felt bad because we didn't know what time they closed, but instead of coming to us and telling us to leave he still stayed there, so very nice of them! Thank you!",

I was greeted by someone that could well be the owner. My gyro was prepared in about 7 mins...Portion was more than I expected since it wasn't a bowl but a tin plate which reminded me of a pasta sized plate...For 8.99 I think it was a good deal...Gyros were delicious and tasted like how it should with lamb and beef ..a good healthy portion of the meat...Basmati rice was fluffy and perfect...Salad and pickled radish was excellent...I definitely recommend the Gyros since I've eaten them from all over socal.....",

    "text": "I was driving by and in need of sustinence for myself and my family after a morning basketball game.  My gyro was ok and reasonably priced at $6.99 -- tho a little salty.  HOWEVER:  (1) my baklava tasted stale despite the freshness date -- which makes me suspect that they relabel? Plus $3.99 for 4 small pieces is steep, especially considering they weren't even good!  I don't think they used real butter.  (2) my son's kabobs took a LONG time even tho the place was pretty empty (only 2 other tables were occupied). (3) portions in general were small.  Each a la cart skewer was $3.99 but each skewer had only 4 dice-sized squares of meat with tiny, almost unrecognizable veggies wedged in between--and all on top of a shallow bed of shredded lettuce and perhaps salad dressing?  My 14-year old son did NOT enjoy these because he wanted them plain.  (4) My husband's \"plate\" was served in a wide, cafeteria-style tray with little compartments.  It included hummus, salad, main, garlic sauce.  Portions were small but spread out by the compartments.  We were not fooled or amused.  4) it seemed like there was 1 man to take orders, make food, AND deliver to our table--service was very slow. Perhaps that's why he kept trying to persuade us to order food from their Panda Express-like display.    Overall I can only give 2 stars because while some of the food was passable, the service, portion size, and value were lacking.",

Based on other reviews I think it's safe to say Naji was the gentleman who helped us and before I even ordered my food I knew I wanted to come back. He was so kind and so helpful. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Gyro combo, one with fries and the other with a salad. Everything was delicious! The gyro was so flavorful and my salad was fresh and crisp. The fries are what surprised me the most! Dare is say they are better than McDonalds? At the end of our meal I went to ask for a to-go bag and thanked Naji for everything. He was so happy to hear that I enjoyed everything that he gave me 2 Baklava, one for myself and the other for my boyfriend. I had never had one before and I'm so glad I was able to try them because they are delicious. I will definitely be ordering some on my next visit! I'm glad we found this gem.",

    "text": "It was a day like any other. I woke up, stretched out and thought to myself, \"will I ever find a place that can truly make the best shawarma?\" And so I began my quest. I spent countless nights and long hours searching and searching for something, anything, that would satisfy this craving, this itch for a worthy shawarma. However, after a time, it seemed as though this would be a fruitless endeavor. Was there such a thing as good shawarma? Was it even possible? Perhaps I had spent all this time in vain. Distraught and defeated, I carried what was left of me to one last search. It was on this day that I came across the Shawarma Plus. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap. At first it began like any other dining experience, but quickly a new, unfamiliar feeling began to take over my senses. It happened so fast yet hazily slow at the same time, coming to a euphoric standstill as a wave of what I can only describe as pure joy overtook my body. Yes. At last. Serendipity; pure bliss. Here I was at the end of my journey. I have found it, the one worthy of praise. It's name is Shawarma Plus.",

    "text": "I came to check out this place today. I eat a lot of Mediterranean and Greek food. I was excited to try the food here.  I ordered the chicken skewers plate and the lentil soup. There was one girl working behind the counter and she seemed nice and knowledgeable about the menu items.  The lentil soup was served first, as I requested. It is not a usual lentils soup. The lentils are actually pureed, you won't find whole lentil pieces. That's not bad, just an observation. There was a nice puree type of liquid, def some vinegar and lightly salted. Overall a great soup. Try it if you like lentils soup.  After 7, 8 minutes my plate was served. First, one minor issue - the girl forgot to add a fork. So I had to go back to the counter and ask for one.  The plate included numerous items - 2 chicken skewers, small salad, yellow rice, nicely baked whole tomato, baked and cut whole jalapeno pepper, and some kind of white cheese puree in the middle and also humus and pita bread. I personally think there should be no jalapenos in any greek or Mediterranean food. So I removed it. The rice and humus were very good, the salad and tomato, also. But one of the chicken skewers was not cooked all the way, 3 of 4 pieses were a bit chewy. Def needed another 2 minutes on the grill.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and the good skewer tasted amazing.   Also, the place is very clean, it's not small, there's plenty of room inside. There are napkins and some condiments on each table.  Overall I rate it 4 starts and I recommend it to anyone! A great new Mediterranean food spot!",

Their garlic sauce adds great flavor and creaminess to each bite.   I ordered a chicken shawarma (sandwich/wrap only) without pickles and wrapped with a pretty thin pita, which I love for a low carb meal, then the whole thing is grilled for a nice outer crisp texture.   So, You got a wrap with texture, creamy garlic flavor, crunch from the lettuce, with fresh tomatoes, and chicken roasted on a spit. That's all you need for a great bite to eat.

For $30 the portions were pretty small but worse than that was that it was fast food quality. Flavors were off, and the meat was dry and over cooked. On one dish the meat was very bland. And on my chicken skewers were overly sour from the marinade. Even the grilled tomato was hard and unripe.   Definitely, will not be returning and can't recommend this place.",

I had a chicken shawarma with a side salad (instead of fries) and my constant companion had the lamb dinner.  Both were delicious.  My shawarma was excellent with the added pickles adding an interesting (and delicious) flavor.  His lamb was some of the best lamb I have ever had -- it was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Portion sizes are generous -- we both left stuffed to the gills.  The dolmas were delicious, as well as the stuffed cabbage.  We got a chance to speak with the owner (I think).  He was delightful, helpful, and went above and beyond to make our dining experience wonderful.  Prices are very reasonable --particularly when compared to similar offerings around town.    I am disappointed it's taken me so long to discover this gem.  5 stars -- will return soon!!!",

The chicken I had was good, but my boyfriend said its too bland. The feta cheese was placed more in one area of the gyro making it too strong. And gyro was rolled like a burrito. Not mu cup of tea. The fries were good because the oil was good. They are thin fries with the lowery type of seasoning. They the white yogurt looking wauce, but it was made very liquidy. Again not my cup of tea, its too drippy, not good duppong sauce. My boyfriends gyro was beef and lamb. I dont like lamb and when I tried it, I didnt taste the lamb. Thats why my boyfriend disnt like his gyro. He said no flavor and you dont taste the lamb, which he loves. The rice was good, but it was a bit dry. Still I loved rice and hard to screw up. Im writing this review because they have an advertisement that if you write a review you get a free dessert. Sorry guys Im not happy with the gyro taste here. Will I come back? Yes the service is friendly, and I will not order the gyros, perhaps I will find something good. Oh btw the tea is good. Has an anise flavor.",

That's what makes it a Greek salad! Shouldn't have to add that to it. Seems they changed their french fries too. Eh. The old ones were better. Also I thought there was a beef or lamb shawarma in addition to the gyro in the past. Maybe I'm wrong. Last time my only choice was a chicken shawarma. Or gyro. But not a beef shawarma.  The worst part was being charged for pita bread when I ordered hummus. She asked if I wanted to purchase the pita for the hummus. I asked \"I have to pay for that?!\" yes. I then asked well how am I supped to eat the hummus without bread?! Epic fail! Hummus should come with pita. Extra I can understand charging for. But this was ridiculous.

People who were vegetarians loved the salad and dressing!  They loved it so much, some of them took the menu pamphlet.  When I arrived the food was ready, hot, and prepared. I even had help with carrying the food to my car. Thank you Naji for your help and making it an easy day for me to host the party. I would recommended this place to anyone, especially for catering needs!   Neil",

When I got home I noticed that there was in fact grilled tomato & pepper in the dish. The chicken kabob also had zucchini between the pieces of chicken. The rice which was very yellow taste like nothing other then lemon, it was as though it was swimming in lemon, it was disgusting. After taking all is the zucchini of the chicken I attempted to eat it but it was rubbery when you bite into it. I was too scared to eat it after that. I did however eat some fries lol oh, I almost forgot my husband also bought an assortment of sweets, the baklava was HORRIBLE! Worst I've had. It was dry & the all I could taste was the overpowered walnut & rose water taste!",

First of all y'all now have different French fries than what you had when you first opened, I liked those French fries way better that you had when you first opened. Now they are different.. Plus, the meat still not that great in my opinion... Salad and vegetables on plate seemed fresh, tasted good... But overall still not really impressed with the meat. Sorry guys, I tried again after my first visit figuring maybe things had improved, service is very good and clean/tidy restaurant but not very impressed with the food.",

Eat from from styrofoam with plastic cutlery that I have to get myself and then finally clear the table myself the PLEASE Explain what it is that I would be tipping for?????",

The real issue is all of the food is doused in SALT. The food was sooooo salty that none of us could eat it.  Horrible! Even the tabouli was so salty we could not eat it.

Last night I broke fast and had the vegetarian platter, which reminded me of the mezza platter I used eat in Dubai, except everything is on one plate.  The hummus and babaganoush was amazing, as well as the grape leaves stuffed with eggplant.  The flavors were tangy and fresh and the portions are big. I was full of yummy veggie goodness.  They also have meats such as lamb, beef and chicken kabobs.  This is a great place for vegetarians as well as vegans and meat eaters.  They also have a good selection of ready made Arabic/Lebanese food to take home.    Best of all are the home made sweets which are made there fresh. I always leave with a box of fresh baklava.     I have tried the falafel wrap and its's huge, the combo comes with fries and a drink.  This is a good casual place for breakfast, lunch and dinner, prices are good and food is always fresh.  I recommend this place if you are vegetarians or vegan.  Your meat eating friends will love it also.",

Makes me sad.  :(  I went to the location on Decatur and all I can say is OMG....did anyone taste the food?  I took a bite of their \"lasagna\" and all I got was salt and cinnamon.  Eewwwww. I do not like cinnamon in my savory food and I wished the lady at the covet would've told me about the cinnamon as if I knew I would not have gotten it.  Then I thought maybe their falafel would be good like the other location. Nope....falafel was salty as well.  Sadness.....:(   And I was so hoping that this place would be good since it is so close to my house.  *sigh*  Sitting at home now drinking a gallon of water to offset the salt I ate.

Unfortunately, I would say that I do prefer the newer location though both have awkward parking lots. The staff remembered me from previous visits, which was awesome. I always get the same thing: chicken shwarma wrap, extra garlic sauce.  I found it odd that this location, like the other, is set up like Subway where you can watch them make your food- yet my dish was made and wrapped up in the kitchen, brought out to me bagged and ready to go. Props for speed but would have loved to customize my wrap and add cucumber.  Don't forget to grab salads, sauces, dips, and sides from the refrigerated case before you go!

I really wanted to love this place since it was so close to home.   I had the Chicken Shawarma plate. After reading rave reviews about the garlic sauce served with the chicken, I decided against my typical order of a lamb/beef gyro. Half the chicken was dry, the garlic dip didn't save the chicken, THE HUMMUS WAS AWESOME, but there was only 1 piece of thin pita served with the plate which wasn't enough even just for the hummus *sad face*. On top of everything else, the rice was pretty bland.   Let's get down to it.. Would I come back? Maybe.. Probably not on my own though, I'll need some kind of convincing. I'll order the beef/lamb gyro next time. By the way, where was the feta?!  For $15 (including a drink), I want feta!!",

Ordered just a beef and lamb gyro with a soda. Gyro was good but not the best Ive ever had. I would love to come back and try there other menu items. They look really great.",

It was not anything like the gyro sandwiches you can typically get from a Greek restaurant. They were served wrap-style with a tortilla-like pita bread outside. Lastly, their Rose Water Iced Tea just taste like poorly flavored water.  All in all, this place was a miss.",

I believe his name is Narij and we talked while they made my to-go order. He was so kind and you can tell he has a passion for his food. The food, by the way, is delicious!  My husband and I loved our shawarma restaurant when we lived in San Diego.  We recently moved to Las Vegas and have been searching for a Shawarma place out here. This is by far the best in town! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and tasted delicious. I definitely recommend eating the chicken with their garlic dipping sauce- so yummy. The pita was hot and fresh and I loved the pickled veggies. I will gladly come back to eat their delicious food, but its also a business worth supporting because the owner clearly cares about great customer service and making a good product!",

We both sampled the lunch special.   My husband tried the eggplant with cheese, chicken and rice and the hummus. I tried the stuffed cabbage rolls, chicken and rice and the stuffed grape leaves. We also split an order of falafels. I sampled the rose water iced tea that a previous reviewer was raving about, but it wasn't really to my taste.   With all that being said, everything was scrumptious. Highlights were the chicken and rice, falafels, stuffed grape leaves and the hummus. In fact, we enjoyed the meal so much that we decided to get a to-go order of the lunch special on our way out for dinner. We will definitely be back next time we are on this side of town.",

I had a beef shawarma and some mixed veggies.  The meat was so tender and delicious.  The pita was fresh and fillings were flavorful.  My dining partner had a platter with rice, chicken, and veggies.  I've never seen anybody polish their plate off so quickly!   Of course we had to have baklava for dessert!!!  We loved it all!  The atmosphere is great.  I love all of the staff.  It's so nice to walk into a place and automatically feel like you are family.  Counters, tables, floors, and facilities were so clean.  They had a few arcade games that I'm sure my little one would love to fiddle with.  Oh, and most importantly- they have WI-FI!  We will definitely be returning.",

The server built the salad with my choices from a variety of toppings. All selections are laid out buffet style for you to see.  You can also choose small containers of tabouleh, hummus, and grape leaves. We enjoyed the tabouleh and grape leaves.   The flavors were incredible, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean. I hope to be back in this area again, soon, so I can come back!

We ordered the vegetarian platter which came with homemade everything - homemade hummus, babaghanoush, tabbouleh, grape leaves, and Falafels with pita bread. My only feedback would be the tabbouleh was a bit heavy on the oil. I'd recommend taking that down a notch to really freshen it up. That said, literally everything we tasted was superb. The rose water tea was a lovely addition to the whole meal! A must try for any foodies out there. Oh, and ask for a side of harissa if you want some spicy kick in your dish.

Food looked good, we were hungry and excited to try this place. There was a chicken shawarma pizza that my friend asked about - the owner stated that this just got featured today and it's been flying off the shelf, I got a chicken shawarma wrap and my friend and I were going to share. The pizza was clearly not old and must have been sitting out for hours... It wasn't even served warm, I had to ask the kitchen to reheat it.  The wrap was mediocre at vest... What really bugged me was when I asked for lemon wedges for my iced tea, which the owner told me I can't do because it's rose water tea.. Too bad I asked for Lemon wedges., Instead he gave me a  plastic packet of concentrate lemon juice. This place was a joke!",

They also have a mini deli section that sells tsaziki, baba ghanoush, and pastries like baklava for a decent price (most items are about $3.99).

He is kind and helpful, and obviously very proud of his food which he will tell you enthusiastically is \"all homemade.\" He offers samples of everything, which I have never asked for and doesn't get arrogant when you admit that you don't know what something is. Once, he even gave my 4 year old son some quarters so he could play a video game. Now, I wouldn't expect that every time I went in, but it just shows the person's character. I highly recommend this restaurant.",
