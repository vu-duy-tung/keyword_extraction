    "text": "I'm definitely a fan of this buffet, especially for the price.  Since it's in Downtown Vegas (and away from the strip), even the dinner prices are excellent.  The buffet was approx. $35 for dinner and soft drinks, juices and water are included.  The booze was cheap, also, so worth getting if you want a bucket of beer or something.  Sure, this is The Golden Nugget, which isn't as fancy as the Strip casinos and hotels, but it's great in its own vintage, nostalgic sort of way.  The buffet was large and offered tons of stuff from pizza to soup to fresh carved meats to salads.  Obviously, tons of sides available like mashed potatoes, veggies, breads, rolls, etc.    I thought the food was tasty.  I've been to better, more upscale buffets, sure, but this place was good and the food was well-made.  There was no trouble getting in and we didn't wait long at all to be seated.  Drink service was quick and no complaints about the servers.  I'd go back again and I recommend you do, as well, since this is one of the better buffets on Fremont Street (at least from what I've heard).",

    "text": "The quality of the food offered here is far from exceptional, but there is a pretty good variety available at a reasonable price-- especially for a Las Vegas buffet.  I was kinda surprised to see so many overwhelmingly negative reviews of the Golden Nugget Buffet here on Yelp.  Maybe these folks went in expecting gourmet restaurant quality meals made to order, but with the convenience and price of an inexpensive buffet.  Personally, I didn't have particularly high expectations for a high-volume chow trough on top of a casino.  We ate here twice in a row during our stay at the Nugget: a weekday lunch ($13) and weekend Champagne Brunch ($19, +a $5 surcharge for 'gratuity' as we were part of a larger group).  Both meals were hit-and-miss: fresh fruits, salads, made to order omelettes, and some of the side dishes were great, but pizza, pasta, and several other items were bland and/or incredibly greasy.  This is why variety is key; if one item is crap just get something else!  Lots of desserts to choose from, too.  For some reason the process of getting patrons into the dining area was ridiculously slow, but once inside the service was good-- especially when it came to providing mimosa refills during the champagne brunch!  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I were staying at the Nugget again I'd probably do the buffet again just because of it's convenience and relatively good value.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Sunday morning with my fiance for the Champagne Brunch.  We were staying at the casino and after looking at the menu saw that the brunch was reasonably priced at $19.99, at least as far as Champagne brunches in Vegas go.  The inside of the restaurant looked very clean, had a view of the new pool area out of the window and did not have very much decor to speak of.  The food here was actually pretty good.  It had your standard omelet making station as well as other brunch favorites like eggs benedict and blintzes.  Beyond that they also had a little seafood area with peel and eat shrimp and crab salad, a Chinese food section, salad bar and carving station.  The servers here also kept the mimosa's coming.  Half of my flute probably got filled up 10 times or so while I was sitting there.  They start you off with a flute of it and then have a server walking around with pitchers of it who top you off.  This may go towards the fact that I ate a buffet the night before but I think that my favorite part of the meal was the ceasar salad that I made and then topped with chick peas and beets.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably stop by here again in the future.  The food was pretty good and the servers did an excellent job of keeping the mimosas full which is one of the best parts of a Champagne Breakfast.",

I tried it 3 times breakfast, lunch, and dinner gross, grosser, grossest guess I wasn't drunk enough.

Granted, there should have been more seafood.  But there was just enough of a selection to stuff ourselves silly.  Snow crab legs(whole and still attached to the center of the crab), shrimp, and a Cajun steamed bag of prawns, some pieces of crab thrown in along with a piece of corn on the cob and some yummy spicey sausage.  The crab was good and sweet, the Cajun basket was awesome.  And of course there were other meats there like pork and a sad piece of meat they claimed was prime rib.  Which I consider to really be the only thing wrong with this buffet.  There was plenty of bunny food options too, fruits tons of carb dishes, and of course dessert.  Lots of dessert options and the right size since you should already be stuffed by then.  The Creme Brulie is yummy! Lunch, we got there as they were trying to transform from breakfast to lunch.  Missed out on the bacon.  But the omelet station went on through the lunch serving while we were there.  So score on that.   Breakfast was delicious.  The waffles are small but don't let that fool you.  They are so fluffy on the inside.  Omelets, get an omelet.  There a couple different areas for the eggs and each one is a little different.  One is plain, one with cheese, and one that has bell peppers and ham mixed in.  And like someone said before, check your coupons once you check in.  m-f is 2 for one at breakfast or lunch.  So if you are only here for the weekend, they are no use to you but if you are on a longer trip like we were, those coupons help stretch those stripper dollars you worked so hard to save up!",

The decor was tacky, screamed old people, country kitchen.  The selection was not the best.  Paid like $18.00 for champagne brunch.  My husband had some fried chicken which was extremely dry.  I opted for the chicken fried steak, which after one bite, was the worst chicken fried steak I have ever tasted!  It tasted like something from my old high school cafeteria.  We immediately went and got our money back.  We then took a cab to the Treasure Island buffet.  It was better, but still not great.  I am starting to think the Vegas Buffet idea is over hyped!",

I had a slice it was so tough I could not cut it with my knife.  The other meat on the carving station was baby back ribs.  The ribs were better than average.  The salad selection was limited but very good.  The Greek Salad was very tasty.  The dessert  section was big but I don't do the sugars so I could not tell you how they tasted.  I did scope out the bread pudding for a friend of mine Stephanie in St. Louis just on the maybe she would eat here.  Stephanie the bread pudding was average sorry.  The two stars is the parent company that owns this should know better.  When the Golden Nugget buffet was under the old management it was head and shoulders above this one.  That is just not right..  They charge enough money to put better food out.  I just don't know why they won't step up to the plate.  For goodness sake Main Street Station is better as is the Paradise at the Fremont.",

Like the user below, we couldn't find a review on Yelp, but Frommer's rated it pretty good so we decided to give it a try while we were checking out Downtown Las Vegas.  This buffet is severely lacking and overpriced in my opinion.  The selection was weak, the sushi was absolutely terrible and the roast beef carving station I tried was dry dry dry.  The desserts were also really disappointing.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because our waitress was actually really nice and prompt and they serve full size ice cream scoops on sugar cones. For being one of the 'nicer' hotels in Downtown Las Vegas, I was expecting more.  Will definitely never go back.",

While I approve of moving the buffet upstairs to its new updated area, the buffet itself has really suffered. This used to be a four star buffet in food quality, service, and layout. Now it rates a two.  The layout of the buffet is such that the omelets and carving lines block access to most of the hot dishes. The selection of fresh fruit us limited to cantaloupe only, there is no shrimp or crab at lunch. As a matter of fact, the only thing they have a passable assortment of is desserts.  The quality of the food has also dropped substantially. Dried out turkey, pressed canned ham, and soup from a can is not what I want to eat. If this is their idea of good food, I know that I am not going to try one of the nicer, more expensive restaurants. Why throw good money after bad? I can't understand how a restaurant chain can take over a hotel casino and screw up the restaurant. The only reason I can give is that Landry's wanted to greatly increase their profit margin.",

Overall I'm underwhelmed by this overpriced and pitiful thanksgiving feast don't waste your money and time.I would prefer if you went to Palace Station,Fiesta or even Arizona Charlie's Decatur much better than this rich guy amusement park.",

The service by our two waitresses were awesome. They quickly came and took our drink orders and were so nice!   The food selection was amazing. There was a huge selection of prepared meats, salads, pastas, and vegetables. There was a mix of Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Soul Food, and Asian flavors in the buffet. So, if you had a particular type of food that you liked you could find it or vice-versa. I loved that they had a deli bar with a fresh selection of meat and cheeses. I was able to add some cheese to these flavorful beans and sausage soup that I had--so delicious and the cheese just brought out more of the flavor! My plate was filled with a little bit of everything! I so wish I had a few extra stomachs or just more room in my one so I could have gone back a few more times. I am always a little unsure of buffets, but you could tell that the food was freshly prepared and put out for dinner time.   The dessert selection--no words to describe how it was. I have never seen such a great selection of desserts anywhere. They had everything from pies, cakes, cookies, cheesecake bites, ice cream,   The only thing is I wish that the buffet was a little less expensive. For it being off the strip and $25 it was a little pricey, but I feel it is worth for the most part because of the food selection and service. I would choose this spot if you are looking to get a dinner with a wide variety of options!",

The wait staff was very professional, nice and accommodating for that extra steak knife. The only reason I would not rate this for five stars is because of the lack of rotation in the menu. As a guest at the hotel and meeting there multiple times I tended to desire something a little different.  Also stale Krispy Kreme Donuts should never be tolerated!  It is one of the cheapest dining options at the hotel and a very good value for your money. If you are looking for a very robust salad bar this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a very robust salad bar this is not the place for you. The desserts were excellent and home made. If you come on the weekend make sure that you are aware that the morning is brunch buffet only and is dinner time prices.",

I was going to looked past the meat thing and tryed to get full off of the salad i had made myself but i had had it when i bit into a huge peice of tomato that litterally filled my mouth with rotten juice that tasted like decaying garbage.. I was completely disgusted i spit it out immediately and informed the manager. Her response was the meat seems over cooked thats all..a followed that up with \"its a buffet\"   She ended up refunding the money we paid, i was very let down because i was ready to eat and didnt have the highest expectations but i also didnt expect to be served bacteria ridden food.  Now i havent vomited but i do feel sick to my stomach and dizzy i pray i dont get food poisoning!",

How about a banana at least?  Also, while you can get all the grape tomatoes you want, there wasn't a sliced tomato in sight and I really wanted to make a BLT!  The carving station was decent, with a couple of kinds of sausage (the Andouille was pretty decent,) and the ham was good, but the turkey was dry, dry, dry.  Some other places offer fresh OJ, the OJ here is out of a bottle.

So after you pay you are getting crammed by other people paying while you are waiting to be seated.  Just strange in my opinion.  The food there is your basic breakfast food.

However, the selection was not very large and had some odd choices available.  I would go to the buffet at Main Street Station if given a choice.",

Also a great desert bar, best \"bread pudding\" I ever had. Where they really excelled was a waiter named Darryl. I eat out a lot and this guy is something. When hes not filling drink orders he is busing tables, moving them for different size groups, He's beyond pleasant, every movement has a purpose. He's what will make me come back. Spent 10 years in a convention hotel, I recognize the talent.",

I have been going to this champagne brunch for years. the service was always good and champagne flowed freely. went today and not only was the price $5 more, no more free champagne. our server's english was not the best and it sounded like she said it was included but alcohol cost extra. it was $3 for a mimosa and $4.50 For a glass of champagne. the weekly paper listed it as champagne brunch for $19.99. we questioned them at the front and were told it changed 3 months ago. how would we know that? no offers of compromise. too bad because the food is very good. I just feel a little duped.",

This place was very good and for the price of 20.99 on Tuesday Seafood Buffet. Now it didn't have much for seafood as I like. I enjoy crab legs and steamed shrimp. It didn't have crab legs. And the shrimp was cold. I did ask the cook at the pasta station if he could heat them up and boy did he go out of his way. He saute them in butter and garlic and added some other spices and they were amazing. The carving station was nice with moist roast beef and turkey. The sausages was good as well. There was 4 types sushi but not what I would eat, and the fried shrimp was good. The pasta station was unique and an abundant of deserts. I did not have any since I was so full. Decent place if your close by.",

Other than the salad bar, they have your standard buffet fare; prime rib, turkey, pizza, chicken, make-your-own pasta, a bit of seafood and quite a few small desserts.  All the stations were manned when I needed them, which is always nice, but the server put my gravy all over everything on the plate (including the pizza) instead of just on the turkey and/or mashed potatoes. Nothing stood out as being super good, but it was plentiful and, well, I always have the salad bar. And the shrimp. I love shrimp. The sushi (California roll-type) was decent, too. They never dallied in taking away dirty plates.",

Time to find some grub and fast.  We were wondering in and out of almost every casino till we somehow made it to the second floor of the Golden Nugget. We scoped out the lunch buffet, and for $11 we gave it a shot.   For a buffet, I thought it was pretty tasty. Granted, I do not eat meat, so I can't vouch for their meat dishes, but they had plenty of options for both vegetarians and carnivores. I read the previous reviews only after going here, and disagree with them. I don't know if I just came at the right time, but all dishes were freshly put out.   I filled up on their numerous salads. Artichoke/tomato mix, caprese, pasta salad, 4 bean salad, and potato salad. All were delicious. I also had some mac and cheese that was pretty tasty too. The GN buffet really hit the spot, I am so glad we discovered it,",

I have to say, the prime rib here was excellent. Tender, tasty and the outer 'crust' had just the right saltiness to it. Mmmm.   Lots of choices from the salad bar section. Many buffets skimp on the fixings in buffet salad bars, but I like those that let me have a variety of raw veggies to pile on as well as shredded cheese and crunchies like sunflower seeds and/or croutons.   Desserts were pretty good. Fresh, moist cakes and a variety of ice cream flavors to choose from. I don't remember the price going in, which I take as a sign that it wasn't ridiculously priced. I want to say it was around $20. Not bad at all.  Bonus? Everyone working there was super nice. Always a plus.",

After we finally got in after about a 30 minute wait (9:30 am), we knew why the wait was so long.  There was only one \"seater\".  Paying was quick, but with only one seater, one slow seater, we noticed many open, set tables stay open for at least 10 minutes before anyone was seated at them.  We experienced several other buffets where the staff busted their buts cleaning off tables and seating new parties.  The breakfast food at this buffet was decent, and it actually had the best selection of items at its salad bar.  One weird feature about this buffet is that there are yellow lights above most of the tables which makes it hard to differentiate colors on your plate.",

My most recent visit was Memorial Day weekend so prices for buffets were incredibly inflated ($50+ per person) so when we walked by and saw the GN was only $21.99 we went for it. We wanted to get one vegas buffet visit in during our trip.   The best options were the pastas- mac and cheese, ravioli, bow tie pasta. Lots of creamy sauces!Some of the Asian offerings were pretty good too especially the General Tao's chicken. Spicy, sweet and cooked nicely so it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.   I have a massive sweet tooth so the dessert section was heaven! I highly recommend the pineapple upside down cake and the Black Forest cake. Did not like the coconut cream pie or the apple cobbler.   If you're looking for an affordable buffet with some decent food, this is your place. If you're looking for a foodie experience, go somewhere else.",

Don't you tired when there are a lot of people who riffle through the food at a buffet? And what is left is a big nasty mess! Well, you don't have to worry about that when you come to the Golden Nugget Buffet! I must say it's rather clean, and very well presented.  I've eaten there mostly for breakfast & dinner in the past, and have always had a pretty pleasant experience.   I was just here the other day for breakfast.........the breakfast buffet is not really large with a lot of selection, but what they do have is probably sufficient for you to fill your tummy.   I do like that they have a carving station, and a chef that will make you fresh eggs or a fresh omelet.  Besides all the nasty breakfast meats - :Link Sausage, Bacon, Portuguese Sausage, Chicken Fried Steak, Spam, etc., they do offer a healthy fare too like oatmeal, cereal, or fresh fruit.  As for me, da local boy in me gotta have his Spam! Yes, if Spam was healthy.........I swear on my deathbed that I'd eat it everyday! That's how much I love Spam!!!   For you folks (NFH) = Not From Hawaii..........Hawaii people eat the most Spam per any capita!   Spam is da Hawaiian Steak Yo!!!!  See this link yourself -  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehawaiiplan.com%2Fwhy-do-hawaiians-love-spam%2F&s=933cfe120d3135bfcde585286c102695303c5555c30b6726f77760ee9fb45638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thehawaiiplan.com/why-do...</a>  And don't get me wrong, I didn't only eat Spam here.........I also had a fresh egg omelet with everything in it! And I must say the omelet was deeeeeeeeeeeelicious!!!!  To add some healthy junk in, I ate some grapefruit, then to ruin by healthy eating, I proceeded to eat a slice of cheesecake & bread pudding! LoL!   Hey man, it's all about moderation right? LoL!   Service here is pretty good, as the waiter or waitress is pretty attentive. They also leave you a big pot of coffee (if you're a coffee drinker), that way you won't have to keep bothering the waiter or waitress for a refill. How's that for efficiency?  Well, if you're ever in the downtown area, check out the Golden Nugget Breakfast Buffet.......pretty inexpensive too at just $12.99 per person.",

The positive reviews were for the breakfast.  Let me check this out.  The selection was big.  Anywhere from the simple cereal and yogurt to salmon. Eggs Benedict and steak.  The steak was medium to medium rare and tender.  It was also flavorful. I also tried the freshly carved ham.  I was expecting it to be a little salty and dry, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was juicy and not salty.  It was really good.  I don't know if I would visit for dinner, but i'll definitely be back for breakfast.",

Ok thats cool, Got a booth it was very soft and had so many different colors of vertical lines, mesmerizing. The guy who cut the meat looked very mad as he slices my un eat able piece of roast beef he gave me. The refill guy was on point.  I peed two times he just kept filling my drink. Most the food was ok, they had collard greens with bacon.  The sign does not say bacon so if i was Muslim i would be pissed.  Great desserts though check it out  P.s.

Word to the wise, this is when you join their rewards program, so make sure to do that first. Our overall bill for a family of 6 was $102, which was equivalent to what we paid for fast food burgers on the strip.  The variety of food was good, although I would have liked to see a little more variety of items. There were some things that looked like they had been there a while, which was not a sight to see.  The steak I had was good, so that helped, and I really enjoyed the baked potatoes. My kids and husband tried a variety of items and the steak and shrimp was their favorite. The staff was great and the waiter we had was fantastic. The line to get in was quite painful and, when I left, it looked like we had \"beat the crowd.\" I would say that this is a good buffet for someone looking for a deal and some good food. My kids and husband enjoyed it and it did not completely take all my money, so give it a try.",

It didn't start well when we arrived and found no line.  We approached the counter and the hostess told us to go to the other side of the counter.   No problem.  Then THAT hostess told us to go to other side.   So neither wanted to help us?  That wasn't a great introduction.    We were seating pretty quickly after we paid for our lunch.  From this point on, the service was fantastic. The servers look like they've been since the Golden Nugget opened - but that's a good thing!  They know what service should look and feel like.  Personalized, polite, quick, and always done with a smile.  Good job to that team!  Unfortunately, the food was fairly basic, and in a few cases, less than.  I had some Turkey, but had to reach over the counter to add the gravy I wanted.  Odd setup.  They had sandwiches, which I guess is OK, but not what I want from a buffet.  I'll go to the pool bar for that.  The chicken was dry, the soup was salty - all in all, it was just basic.  They are a smaller buffet so don't expect a ton of choices compared to the Strip buffet's, but that wouldn't have mattered had the food been amazing.    In the end, it served it's purpose, which was filled us up for the afternoon so we could gamble more.  Will I be back - hard to tell on that one, but I would probably want a 1/2 off coupon.",

I can say though that they have a made to order sauteed shrimp bar that we just couldn't get enough of.  We kept going back to try the different combinations of flavors (garlic, spicy, etc).

I took my wife and daughter to the Golden Nugget, being a new resident to Las Vegas we had heard a lot of good things about the Gold Nugget and wanted to experience it for ourselves. I am a food and beverage manager by trade so typically I am more patient but still critical of food.  The Golden Nugget Buffet is the worst buffet I have ever encountered.  In 20 years of food and beverage I have never seen specials listed as \"Chef Special with coagulated sauces and chunks of mystery meat. The seafood salad was in chunks of imitation crab that was not even broken up and was hard as a rock with a pungent seafood odder coming from it.  I went to the pasta station hoping to find some fresh items and the mushrooms on the station were black and the sauce wasn't an Alfredo sauce it was also some coagulated cream sauce that the cook after preparation scooped piles of parmesan cheese on top of.  For $18.99 not only did I leave with a literal bad taste in my mouth but the service was horrific as well. The server came to refill my daughters coke with watered down coke that had no carbonation in it at all, he showed up three times to the table and didn't even speak once to us. When leaving I was handing my parking ticket to the hostess in the front who was yawning and when I approached her she put her arm up and continued to yawn and pointed toward the cashier who let me know I could validate downstairs..... This seems to be the Fools Gold of Las Vegas in my opinion!",

Our friends were starving when we arrived so finding food was on the top of the priority list. We settled with The Golden Nugget so we didn't force anyone into a major case of hypoglycemia.   Considering we paid 20 bucks, on a weeknight, I was expecting something somewhat decent.... aaaand I was wrong. Everything had this wired gray hue to it. Mixed greens and spinach on the salad bar was wilted with small pieces of rotten lettuce intertwined. The romaine and iceberg was the only thing that looked edible. The beets were a strange hue of gray(ish)-red.  I wish I had taken a picture. I didn't even dare touch them. My fiance had a small portion of fried rice and chow mein on his plate and I couldn't believe he would even dish that stuff on his pale. Both looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for about 5 hours. SO dry and greasy looking. *gag* Steak offered was too tough to even chew through. My friend and I LITERALLY had to spit it out into our napkins because there was no chewing through that stuff. Simply horrible. Mashed potatoes tasted old and stale. Desserts looked like something you would find at your grandmother nursing home (then again, so did everything else). Apple pie had a filing that looked like it had come straight from a can...only with no apples in it. Just this wierd apple-jelly-goo. Its hard to mess up sugar, guys! They somehow managed.   The only thing on the buffet that tasted even remotely decent was the carved turkey and scalloped potatoes. Oh, and the ice cream from the ice cream counter was edible.   Honestly, Ive had better meals at HomeTown Buffet and Golden Corral and paid about half as much.   Avoid, avoid, avoid.",

    "text": "This wasn't the worst buffet I've been too but it's got a spot near the top. We took the tour bus trip and GN is one of the stops. Needing lunch, we thought it best to eat at the hotel since he bus comes around every 45 minutes or so. We found the buffet, not a line, not too terribly busy. I paid with my credit card and was seated. I'll get back to the credit card later. The food was...ok. It was food. We were thankful to not starve but it was a step above cafeteria food (the kind you were dished up as a kid). But it filled us up, service was great. Later that day I checked my statement and $2 was added to my total. So I'm thinking someone wrote in a $2 tip on the tip line. Because I know the price of the buffet, I know what I authorized and I was charged $2 more. I didn't call,  I didn't make a big deal out of it. I just thought it was lame. Want more tips? Work harder. Much better food in LV for the price, never again.",

Their dessert selection could have included jello and something more appealing than pies and cakes...Overall, better than Paradise's buffet!!",

I have never been to a vegas buffet, so I was super excited!  The waitress let us take a tour of the buffet first to see if anything appealed to us and then we went back to the cash, paid, and got our seats.  The buffet was nice, honestly, they had a lot of great options for meat an seafood lovers. Unfortunately not a whole lot for vegetarians, but we made it work. I mostly filled up on the salad bar an cheese pizza. My hubby got a delicious cream pasta made that was really good as well as an omelet.   The desert bar was nice, and had a great selection of sweets.  The one thing that threw me off, was the woman working the salad station. She kept taking her dirty rag and pushing all the dropped food back in the bins. Not appealing, and for sure, not very sanitary.  Two plates in and I was content, and the hubby was stuffed. Worth the price? For us, it was not, but the experience was nice.",

I would put this Buffet into the category of: Not only would I not eat there again, I would aggressively try to change my friends mind if there was a group trying eating there.  We ate there for Sunday brunch (yesterday) right around 10:00am. It's $18 for champagne brunch even if you don't want champagne. Everything was cold except the omelette/egg stuffs the guy cooked right in front of you. No hyperbole on that. Eggs, bacon, pizza, veggies, fried shrimp, rice, eggs benedict...it was ALL cold. We started trying things we didn't even really want just to see if it was cold. It was.  Fine, ok. You're hungover and you're just going to drink $18 worth of bubbles. Wrong. The service is sloooooow. You'll be lucky to have three or four flutes of champagne in an hour. They don't exactly take the time to fill the glass up to the top either.  If you get suckered into eating here by your friends, stick with the guy making the omelettes and eggs. That'll be hot. And you can toast the bread yourself, so you know that will be good. The omelette guy will, however, cook the ever living bejesus out of your omelette so that it's dry.",

I was actually waiting to go further for the other food since people were waiting when really it was just the pasta line.  The rest of the food I tried like the sushi were good in my opinion.

We went out there Sunday night - the seafood buffet is ONLY Friday and Saturday. Every other night they basically only have shrimp. While they were decent certainly nothing to write home about. For some reason they had \"warm plates\" right next to cold shrimp - dumb.   As far as the rest of the food, pretty poor. The sushi was very limited and while it was relatively fresh (watched the chef making it), it was very bland. The meatballs and pasta were awful, as was the Chinese food.   The only thing of note in my mind was the desserts. They were plentiful and in a size such that you could have a few tasters without having to pick a single one.   As far as the staff, generally career waitresses who seem to care less. Was drinking a soda and they kept refilling it with warm soda and never added ice.   Maybe the seafood buffet is still good, but I would t hit this buffet again unless you enjoy desserts at a slightly lower cost than the strip buffets.",

All the food was warm, the service was steady, and our refills came often.  The one downside I could find this visit was that the Asian food section was bland.  However the omelette station was great, and there was also a great selection of desserts.  Overall don't come expecting this to be the Bellagio buffet or something high-class or fancy.

I was walking around on Fremont Street and decided to turn in here.       After seeing the world's largest golden nugget on display, I caught sight of the Buffet sign. I meandered the maze of slot machines and card tables and eventually climbed the stairs to get to the buffet. Twenty(ish) dollars got me in and seated at a table where the two nicest ladies helped me out with beverages and taking away my plates.      My first round was certainly meaty. Pig, Cow, Fish, Crustacean, Fowl....no species of God's creation was safe from my appetite. \"Sure I'll try that.\" \"Can I get a slab of each please?\"  \"Oooh. Let's get some of those!\" I'll admit. My eyes were far larger than my stomach with this trip. Everything looked way tasty and smelled wondrous. I was also kinda sorta guilty about how many species of animal were about to be sacrificed to me.     After plate number one I was considering throwing in the towel. Then one of the nicest ladies comfortingly said to me; \"Take your time. Digest. You can stay all night if you want!\" Thank you nicest lady. I really wish I remembered your name.  I broke out my game-boy and began playing video games for a lil bit to digest and clear out some space. Thankfully, I carry that thing for just such occasions.     After ten or so minutes, I made a stab at food sortie number two. I wanted to make my Mom happy, so I got a plate of salad. Crisp green veggies and red tomatoes. Even more numbers on the species list I suppose. All was refreshing and crisp and as good as these things can be.     After the veggie plate, I decided to make a run on the dessert station.  I made sure to grab a full sized plate for this trip. Pies. Cakes. Cannolis. Moussey things and creme brulee things. I tend to overdo it on the dessert round. Of course, by this point, I was super stuffed and while unable to completely finish the things, I was able to manage a sampling of everything.        The buffet is great.  It's very pretty. It's very tasty. I'm sure Santa would have been happy. Or Jesus. It's his birthday...right? Happy Birthday Jesus!      I'll be back if I'm wandering Fremont again. Thanks Golden Nugget!",

EVERYTHING was dry... from the overcooked roast beef, to the CRUSTY Denver omelet, to the nasty desserts.  But, hey, their ice tea was good.  Service was terrible. We had plates of inedible food pilling up at the end of out table and it took way longer than expected to be taken away. I shouldn't have tipped the waitstaff but left a couple of bucks anyway so that they know we left and now they REALLY DO have to clear the #$%^ table.  Normally, I would give a buffet like this 1-star but there HAS to be a special place in Yelp Hell for Circus Circus's buffet.",

Some nice fish choices. Clam Chowder was not the best tasting. Pretty boring salad bar. Mediocre sushi. For $32 a person the best part would have been the crab legs, but i don't eat them so I'm a buffets best friend. Didn't try any of the desert options. Had fruit instead. Hey, you can't go wrong with that!   I dug the old school, never-been-remodeled vibe. It brings back old Vegas if you like that sort of thing, and I do. The place was not very busy which was a huge plus on a Friday night. No need to push your way through or wait in long lines! I should mention there was one waitress that was extremely loud. Simmer down. Just got paid. It's Friday night and i want to relaaax and eat in peace!",

The chicken fried steak patty has seen better days.  It was dry and a but stale probably from sitting there for a good while.  There were more items I tried that missed the wow factor and fell into the typical buffet food fair.    Will I be back? Probably not.

I can't really explain it in words. She was just horrible.  We came back as a party of 2 the day we were leaving our honeymoon.

Loretta needs to take a customer Service refresher coarse. I don't understand why she repeatedly was so rude to Us. By the way no one in my party was ever drunk.

But no price was listed for lunch or dinner. You guessed it, we payed over  $20.00 for our meals.   The food was fine however. My wife enjoyed her prime rib. Even though when she asked the person carving for an end cut, she didn't receive one.  We asked to be seated with a view of the hotel pool and the shark tank. Too bad the pool was drained for winter time repairs. The sun was position perfectly so that the shark tank and other aquatic life were only shadows or glares from the sunlight.  I ate a little of everything.  Prime rib, cod, pork loin, and Turkey, all from the carving station. There was shrimp displayed, but I don't care for shrimp. But still,  nice to have more than one selection.   Vegetables on my plate included mashed pitatoes, asparagus, green beans with bacon.  That's right I ate asparagus without being told.   Cold cuts were cut up and presented very nicely.  Almost made me not want to ruin what was on display. Yeah I don't think so.  Turned out to be a descent outing.

If you come on here expecting the buffet at the Aria or something like that then I guess you might be disappointed. Some of these reviews on here crack me up, people expect some outlandish stuff from a downtown buffet, but from my experience this place is certainly better than your average Golden Coral style of place. First off the place was nice, clean and had good service, and yes the servers do bring you drinks so no self serve here. As for the food this is what I found when we are breakfast:  The good-the honey ham from the carving station was great, as were the scrambled eggs, the breakfast sausage links and every desert and fresh fruit we tried. The desert station was all around great, especially the creme brule and cheesecake.  The OK- the French toast was so-so, as was the bacon, and yougert/granola station. The omlete station was pretty standard but was fine.  The bad- the only thing I had that was bad were the sausage patties, they were pretty dry and bland, go for the links which were great.  Overall we enjoyed the Golden Nugget buffet, the price and selection were perfect after a long night on the strip. If you are looking for lobster tails or organic milk then do us all a favor and go to the Wynn and stop bitching about places like this one.",

They serve all meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner and there is always some cross over so whenever you go, you will find something to eat. The price is reasonable considering the service and the quality of the food. There is usually a line but it moves very fast. We were seated for lunch in less than 3 minutes. Once seated a server is right there to get a drink order and to let you know about the buffet. They come by to clean up dishes and check on you. We loved the service, and very friendly as well. The selection is very large. From a great salad area to a cut meat area, they have it all. If you want Italian they have that, Asia, got ya, American, there is a ton of it.

The food was just as good or better than others I've paid much more for. It was a great selection and everything I tried was fresh and at the appropriate temperature. Our server was an older gentleman named Frank. He was awesome. Very friendly, accommodating and funny. After our meal there we were sorry we didn't eat there more often.

    "text": "I hadn't been to Vegas downtown in years, but always used to stay and eat at the GN, where their buffet was always hands down the best in downtown!  I finally got a chance to go back, looking forward to this dinner outing last Halloween after the parade, and took some friends.  Wow, was that the wrong decision, and it was just so disappointing; hard to believe this buffet is so bad now.  I heard ever since Steve Wynn sold the hotel operation, it's gone downhill--of course I hear this all now, when it would have been great to know beforehand.    Food was very mediocre at best, and table service was also on that par, even though the lady from Hawaii was very nice.  She got so distracted--and it wasn't even that busy--that she neglected us most of our time there.  Had to ask for drink refills all the time.  Food servers behind the counters were not all that friendly either.  Paying $26-27 for dinner on that Friday night for that service and food made me sick.  I would have rather had a hot dog at Coney Island!  Upon my return home, since I wasn't staying at GN, but on the strip, I wrote the management through the website, by email, and even by postal mail, direct to the hotel.  Here is my note:  As a long time (30+ years) patron and advocate of the Golden Nugget, I regret to say that I am extremely disappointed in our recent  dinner at your buffet (Halloween night).  I brought a party of four (My wife and another couple, our best friends) to eat dinner.  It was their first time, but my wife and I have eaten there many many times in the past years, however, we have not even been to Las Vegas in the past 10 years.    I assumed things would be excellent (quality, selection, service, etc.) as they always had been (historically).  That was far from the truth, and unfortunately it made me feel terrible for recommending the GN's buffet for our dinner that night, to my friends.  Food quality was the most disappointing, having no comparison to even the TI's buffet which we had the night prior.  Selection was rather limited and poor, and although table service was \"ok\" (lady from Honolulu), most of the servers behind the buffet stations were not very hospitable, energetic, or welcoming.  The dessert guy was the only exception.  I am scheduled to stay (with my wife and son) at GN in December, but I guess we'll not be eating at the buffet.  It's so disappointing that the quality of your hotel's buffet has gone down so much!  It was always the BEST in downtown!    We didn't try any of your other restaurants, but wonder about them.  In the past, we've tried Lily Langtree's, the Carson St. Cafe and a steakhouse (I believe), all of which used to be very good.   Now, I'm not so sure.  Anyway, I just wanted you to know about our disappointment.    ------ I never heard back in response at all!!  I guess they either don't care, or there are so many people complaining they don't have the time to respond to everyone.  WARNING:  GO AT YOUR OWN RISK!!  I WILL NEVER AGAIN.",

The choice was acceptable, I had some eggs Benedict that were significantly overcooked (probably had been sitting there for too long) and they don't have any options for lattes or cappuccino even with a surcharge. Not nice enough to return.",

    "text": "Nothing to write home about. It's your typical low budget buffet. I wasn't expecting to see an elaborate spread so I really didn't have high expectations. I should've lowered my \"low\" expectation. The reviews are mixed so we must've picked an off day to eat dinner here.   Nothing really stood out expect for the pizza alfredo which the pizza guy hand tosses and makes from scratch. Everything else was just blah. The roast beef was dry and tasteless. When the guy served it me, he practically flung it on my plate and looked angry. When I asked for the au jour sauce, he acted like it was inconveniencing him. I was handing him the bowl to put the sauce in but he ignored the bowl, grabbed my plate and dumped the sauce all over my food! Literally. I mean he didn't just put it on the meat, he put it all over my whole plate. Sheesh, who does that? My plate and the rest of my food was drenched.   The fried chicken which was now drenched in that sauce was also tasteless. The mashed potatoes were good, not fantastic but good and yes they were drenched in that dumb sauce too. Like I mentioned the pizza alfredo was really good. Even though it was drenched in that stupid sauce, I really liked it. In fact that's all I ate after that.  As for deserts. it looked very good but looks can deceive. The pastry guy was putting out new deserts and me being one who likes to talk to anyone (annoying right) told him the deserts looked awesome and asked him if they were made in house. He said they weren't and that they were bought at a store! LOLOLOLOLOLZ! OEM! I would never admit that. I did have a good laugh though. The deserts were dry. Nothing special.   Will I go back here? Probably not, oh wait, we did go back for breakfast which was pretty good. You can order your eggs how ever you want them. I ordered over medium and asked for 1 egg but the guy misunderstood me and made two. Not a biggie, but the funny thing is, he kept dumping the eggs and making new ones because he didn't like the way they had turned out. I kept telling him it was ok, but I guess he was a bit of a perfectionist...lol. Gotta love Vegas.",

The buffet choices weren't overwhelming, and what items they did offer I felt they did well. The prime rib was tasty, the hot items were appropriately hot. The seafood section had fresh ceviche and peel and eat shrimp. The cream gravy they had for the biscuits and gravy and/or chicken fried steak was some of the best gravy i've had in a long time. The little mini egg rolls in the chinese food section were hot and crispy, and the corn beef hash was just right. The deli section had amazing smoked salmon and other deli meats...and the english muffins that pillowed the eggs benedict was crispy and not soggy! Bonus!  We will definitely make the trip back to the Golden Nugget for Champagne buffet! We've never received such amazing service at a buffet, ever. If Diane is working, ask for her! She is by far one of their hidden crown jewels. You won't regret it!",

Well, I mean you CAN do that and the Golden Nugget DOES do that, but you can't expect it to go unnoticed.  A dish of \"steak\" is filled with small cuts of very tough meat that are smothered with a sauce that is actually worse than the crappy gravies Heinz sells in a can.  The carving station turkey managed to taste like fish. It's a miracle, because I saw the guy cut the meat off of a turkey carcass. But it didn't taste like turkey.  Surely the pasta offerings would be better. Wrong. I think they fill their cheese ravioli with toe jam. It's terrible. Terrible.  I have a standing rule: I never rave about a restaurant's mac'n'cheese or mashed potatoes. I believe that those two items are simply impossible to screw up and none is truly as AMAZING as people claim. However, I can honestly report that the Golden Nugget Buffet's mac'n'cheese could very possibly be the worst ever created by human hands. Mushy, awful, chemically-tasting artificial cheesy nastiness. It's truly crap-tastic.  Do yourself a favor. Take the $25 per person that you would spend here and bet it all on black at the next roulette table you pass. It's a better value for your money.",

    "text": "Terrible. Don't do it. I checked in to get some work done and somehow ended up here despite prior experiences. My logic was that for $16.95 I could find something to fill my stomach and get back to work. WRONG. The sushi contained no fish. The roast beef had the texture of a Goodyear tire. The Italian food was so bad I am horrified to think of what they have done to the cuisine of my heritage. The chicken parm tasted worse than the dollar frozen food. The ravioli's were bad tasting mush and the sauce or gravy was pathetically prepared. After that the limited selections left next to nothing to chose from. A mall buffet in northern Wisconsin blows the selections here away. I next moved to the dessert hoping I would find something edible. WRONG. The deserts were bland and I tried several. One last point - at $16.95 this would have been a very bad mistake. Actually it was 28.95 plus tip.  To be fair the workers were all very great. Friendly attentive excellent service. They made for the perfect contrast. Landry's shame on you.",

First of all, if you go on the weekends and you have a coupon for a free meal with your stay you have to pay the difference in price on the weekend which was never disclosed.  We tried their breakfast and there was a lot of food to chose from.  Since I am vegetarian I opted for scrambled eggs, potatoes and fruit.  The scrambled eggs and potatoes were cold and it did not taste right.  I decided to have a custom omelet which at least I watched my food getting cooked and that was decent.  My husband however tried the scramble eggs and sausage but couldn't finish his meal.  Not too long into the day he got sick and felt like he got food poisoning from breakfast.  It was very unfortunate.",

It's pretty basic but covers your needs. You get a salad bar, dessert bar, cold food/sandwiches, and hot sections. They had a small asian cuisine section that was ok. I'd say Panda Express is much better and cheaper. They had bbq today and the friend chicken was so over cooked that it clinked against the metal bowl it was in when I dropped a chicken leg. I ended up passed on it. They also had bbq beef which was really dry and not that great.  Honestly, the entire time I was eating my lunch I wish I had just walked down the block to White Castle and gotten some chicken sliders. It would've been cheaper and I would've been happy.  The apple cobbler and scoop of ice cream for dessert was tasty.  The wait staff was very nice and the ladies working the register were also very nice.   Again. If you have one buffet to go to while in Vegas, do yourself a favor and go to the Bellagio Buffet. You'll pay more but it's worth it for the quality of food you'll be eating.",

They have an assortment of choices and they change a few food selections around each day so it was nice not to have the exact same foods all the time. The bread pudding is a favorite amongst the family. A must for all to try. It's more like a bread custard. So good. Of course my favorite is the desert section, so many selections of cakes to try. My favorites is the Boston cream cake. My son, who is a very picky eater, ate well and health (until desert) at the buffet. I recommend the brunch so you get breakfast and lunch foods at the same time, and dinner once.",

Well dont expect much from this place, we visited here after hearing they have a good buffet. I was disappointed that the food was very limited and not refilled its like they wait until the see someone \"Scrapping the bottom of the pan\" just to get something. There was no line on a Saturday evening, usually a buffet would be packed especially on Saturday night. I would probably not come back here again, I am glad I tried them once, that was enough for me. I will go to others and try. I think they really need to work on their food quality and customer service skills, to keep people wanting to come back. I think when a buffet has no line on a Saturday evening that must tell one something. The place was clean around the table area, but the buffet area could've had some work to it.",

The roast beef was good (but not great) and the desserts were good. I think the biggest issue is just that there are not as many dishes available to choose from as many other buffets at the same price. In addition, just some little things like no hand wipes after eating the crab legs, no hot butter available for the crab, and no pizza available to eat at the time we were looking.  However, the food is better quality than bottom bargain buffets, so you shouldn't avoid this place if you need dinner.",

Big juicyn chilled flavorful snow crab. (Dipped in hot butter) Prime rib was ok. Good salad.  Good desserts.  Not bad for the price.

    "text": "I've previously came here the year before and my experience was overall mediocre. The food was eh and the service was decent. I just got to Vegas a little bit ago and came to the buffet. Keep in mind I was very hungry after a 6 hour drive from California. I thought it would be lunch but it was brunch so lots of breakfast foods not what I was hoping for nor did they inform me. I made do with what they had and I regret it very much. I feel sick to my stomach and my friend was disgusted that our server had snot hanging out of her nose. I barley finished my plate and my friend and sister took 2 bites of salad and couldn't take another bit due to the thought of the waiter. We asked for the manager he immediately came over and talked to us. We told him what happened, he said he would talk to the waiter but we didn't want to cause a problem. We just wanted a refund for our bad experience.  He walked away and we believe he talked to the waiter. We were expecting him to come back but didn't. We waited 15 -20  minutes before going to the front desk to ask again. At this point I wanted to run straight to the room to get sick. We asked for the manager again and the kind lady at the front desk said he'll be here in 1 min... We kept waiting and in my mind about to throw up got very impatient and asked for the manager again the lady called him again and his phone went straight to voicemail.. He popped up behind us and rudely gave us a refund. He made it clear he didn't want to. The cash register lady asked what the refund was for and he rudely said \"they didn't like the food\". I'm sorry sir but would you like us to say very loud that our waiter had snot hanging a mile long from her nose, to the point of my friend thinking it touched her food on the table? I wouldn't think so. I definitely won't be going back here after feeling like shit.",

They advertise sushi and the products they used mostly came out of cans like tuna or crab.  The bbq was dry and overcooked.   The Chinese food was good but far from authentic...like the Mongolian Beef was tasty but white onions not green onions.  The white steamed rice was crispy like when it's left in a hot pan without water.  The Italian food was okay but the pizza was cheap on dough and cheese.  The best part was the omelet bar.  Fresh ingredients made to order.  I love buffets and always go back for seconds...this was the first ever time I didn't go back.  PS - the service was awesome though.  Our drinks were always full.",

That being said I was there for breakfast, everything was fresh. Here is what sets them ahead in the downtown area, lox, thats right I said lox at a cheapie buffet, and steak, thats right I said steak! They also put the salad bar out, a lot of places don't do that for breakfast. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",

I've never been a huge fan of buffets as they are typically disappointing and filled with loads of marginal food. My SO on the other hand, loves buffets.   We were pleasantly surprised! Perhaps it was that we weren't expecting much, but for a Sunday brunch at $16.99 this place was pretty good. Here are the highlights:  Scrambled eggs were really delicious, mixed with ham and peppers. Country gravy was traditional and very flavorful Linguisa sausage was spicy Pizza sausage (my SO liked this although I thought it was ok) Ranch dressing on the salad bar was the yummy kind Corned beef hash was pretty tasty Tater tots were yummy If you like macaroons these ones are seriously very very good.  Some of the things that were a miss: the desserts were very bland and we were unimpressed for the most part. Except the macaroons which were delish.  There isn't a lot of variety but I was so full so quickly and for the price it was really quite good.   They had shrimp cocktail and peel and eat shrimp, both of which were nothing special. And there fruit was very typical. There was nothing special on the salad bar either.  The food itself was pretty well seasoned though and for mass production buffets this place was honestly, better tasting than the buffets I've experienced at The Rio, Paris, Flamingo or anywhere else on the Strip.   The service was decent too.     If you are downtown and hungry, I'd say go for it.",

They are good for breakfast and lunch and our book came with two of them.  This buffet is good but not worth full price.  There's not much to say about this place other than the food is very average.  The buffet itself is relatively small, so there isn't a huge amount of variety.  If you're looking for a better selection, I'd recommend going in 15 minutes before they switch from breakfast to lunch.  That way you pay the breakfast price and get to choose whether you want to eat breakfast food, lunch, or some combo.  If you're there for breakfast time, I do recommend the omelet station.  I was surprised to see they had eggs Benedict as well, but it was nothing to write home about.  Overall, I'm giving this place three stars rather than two only because of the 2 for 1 coupon.  I would never pay full price to go here but it is a good value at half price.",

I rely on Yelp reviews to help determine where I might eat when away from home, so I wanted to add one here in support of the Golden Nugget Buffet. We had dinner around 7:30 on a Sunday - no wait to be seated. Plenty of freshly prepared food to choose from. I had prime rib, mashed potatoes, veggies, orange chicken, meatballs, and a couple other things that I could fit on my plate. Everything was hot and delicious. The orange chicken was crispy on the outside, tender breast meat on the inside. Prime rib was perfect for anyone's taste - I had an end cut that was so tender, but there was rare as well for those who prefer that preparation.  There was also a made-to-order pasta bar that looked great, but I was already loaded up with so much else!  My teen boys were in heaven with the large selection of items they enjoyed. Ravioli, short ribs, peel and eat shrimp (deveined and split for you), fried shrimp, sausage and peppers, and of course, the desserts which included hand dipped ice cream in 10 or so flavored to choose from.   The price point was fair and the service from our waiter was perfect. I am so glad I didn't travel to the Strip and spend three times as much - I don't know how it could have been better!",

For $17.99 lunch, it's hard to compare this to strip buffets because they are $25 minimum and most are $30+.   This buffet should be compared to Palms or Red Rock buffet. Compared to those locations, Golden Nugget falls middle to the lower-end. The prime rib and fresh cut meat keeps the comparison alive, but nearly every other item is difficult to swallow. This is coming from a guy who was forced fed old food due to my family's difficult financial situation.   Every processed dessert is near inedible. I'm a guy who used to count calories and eat a well-composed diet. Whenever I do eat refined sugary items, I expect deliciously tasting sugars and corn syrup. You won't find that here.

We walked right in on a Wednesday during dinner time with lots of open tables.   We received great customer service.  If not for our awesome server, I would have given 2 stars.

It's not cheap, but the food definitely tasted high quality to me. When I go to a buffet I like to try a little bit of everything, but I don't like to waste food. We typically go to buffets at the end of breakfast so they are starting to put lunch out and we can get the best of both.   What I like about Vegas is they know they're a tourist town so they know they have to please people from everywhere. They can't just serve American food and do that right. They have to be able to please palates from around the world. That's not easy. What I found most frustrating for most of my stay in Vegas was the lack of accommodation for customers, but at this place they at least try to have some options available (sugar free desserts? OMG!)  Start with breakfast. Are these powdered eggs? They didn't taste like it to me. And the potatoes were definitely fresh. The bacon was crispy and not greasy. They also had eggs Benedict, delicious grits (OK, not Alabama or Georgia delicious, but good,) prime rib, omelets, pies and cakes of all sorts, seafood, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, french toast, you name it.

I think that means more turnover on the food so it's not sitting there in giant trays forever.   There's a salad bar section in the center with a U around it with some cold cuts, cheeses and giardiniera, sandwiches, then the hot stations with Italian, meats/carving station, Chinese, American comfort food, then a chilled shrimp station and deserts.   I was sat facing the buffet and watched as the staff refilled several stations so that was good. I started with the antipasti station and the cheese and proscuitto were very nice and there was a good selection of pickled vegetables. Then I got a plate of carved prime rib which at best was medium. It didn't seem like there was a medium rare piece on it but it was still tender and juicy.   The chilled shrimp were fine. They were definitely brought in frozen already deveined and split but tasty enough. The dessert section was probably the highlight with a wide selection and an ice cream section.   Most of the pastries and desserts were pretty good except for their \"creme brulee\" which wasn't bruleed at all and just had some sugar syrup poured on top which wasn't even caramelized so it wasn't even like a flan.   It was totally fine and I think the small stations help keep the food fresh because it doesn't seem to be that busy on weekdays.",

    "text": "Went here for seafood night specifically for crablegs. I didn't want to make the trek to the strip or pay strip prices I just couldn't do it! Every year for my bday my husband takes me to a buffet for crab legs, we've gone to Bellagio buffet for the last few, I've also been to Baccanal at Ceasars Palace and Samstown buffet before they got rid of crab night. For the price point Golden Nugget Buffet is the best, if you wanna eat your weight in crab legs, this is the place! Literally all I want is a bomb ass salad,endless crab legs and iced tea. And that's exactly what I got! The quality isn't bad in my opinion. It IS a buffet so always keep that in mind. To some extent all buffets are going to be cheap quality. Our bill was 62 bucks for 2 people plus we left a tip, our server was nice, they actually serve you to drinks ( unlike Bellagio that has those fancy coke fountains that are self serve, I hate those! Hate them!). They give you a bucket and crab cracking tools. They had a caprese salad I was super impressed with and HOT crab legs that are whole and not just cold ones that are spilt in half. The hot ones are way better and I prefer them whole. I am a very happy camper and I will never go all the way to the strip for crab legs again. Finding self parking was a bit of a pain but they do validate if you eat there so it was free! I will be back, I don't understand the bad reviews at all. It is small, yes, for sure, but what they have is good and again if you just want a crab night this is the place on Friday nights. I'm super satisfied.",

The buffet for brunch was $25 per person but the hotel offers buy one get 1 free. The service was a little slow getting drinks refilled but it was decent.

I was thinking of those Cinema -old school Downtown buffets for all you can eat for 9 dollars -lol   We got there around 6ish and the food tasted fresh and was served hot. Nothing dry or stale here. I think the Chinese section was my favorite. the cook there was very funny and kept making jokes with me and my wife. He made this buffet very enjoyable.   My favorite was the Chinese dumplings and the meatballs. We normally Eat at the Caesars Buffet so I am not comparing it to that. I am giving this place 4 stars for the value and atmosphere/customer service.   Our waitress was awesome, we had some mimosas and we were not rushed out at all. This will be our go to buffet when we are downtown.  Much better than the Fremont Casino - Paradise Buffet.",

You expect a grand buffet in Vegas, but this one was smaller than one was half the size of one you'd see at a chain buffet.   Our waitress didn't take our drink order until after we had gotten our food and been sitting for a few minutes. She forgot half of our drinks and when asked for more water, she brought us soft drinks.  The breakfast buffet ends at 10:30 and lunch starts after that and so I would recommend getting there at 10 and experiencing the best of both worlds. The desert was the highlight of my buffet.",

First, don't expect a buffet the size of the ones you'll find on the Strip. Nor should you expect the quality. You'll be disappointed if you do.  It was a Wednesday night, so no crab legs. Drinks took awhile. The food in general was average. I did enjoy the turkey breast, though it was a bit dry. The peel and eat shrimp did seem to be deveined - so kudos to them on that. It was a bit soggy, though. The cheese selection was limited, though the prosciutto seemed high quality and the baguette was fresh. I also liked the ground mustard and chutney they had out.  Overall, a fun time. I might go back on another night, but won't be a regular spot when I'm in the area.",

I liked that they offered eggs benedict (overcooked, but oh well) and some of our party did the build-your-own omelette and seemed happy with it.   The food was ok. I hear there are definitely some awesome buffets in Vegas, but if you're over in Downtown Vegas and don't want to make the trip to the strip, this is a pretty good option (if you get the champagne included).",

He called the chef to speak to me and explain this and that.. once you complain, they will offer you a new batch of that specific food you complained and kept on offering me something which I don't have any interest at all.

When I talked to the hostess she said it's been that way for over a year and they haven't changed the website. I wonder how many Tens of thousands of people have been overcharged in the process?",

For breakfast, the buffet provided cereal, oatmeal, fruit, bread, and an assortment of meat. Highlight of the meal was the ham. Nice and juicy! (Usually I dont like  ham because they tend to be dry.) Tried the oatmeal. It wasn't anything special. The bagel was your typical bagel. However the cream cheese was pretty tough to even scoop out, let alone spread.  As for the service (yes there is service at a buffet!), it was slow. I was nearly done with my first plate before the waitress appeared to ask us what we like to drink.  Would I come here again? Probably not. But if they gave me a voucher for a free meal, sure I'll use it ;)",

Its always clean the only downfall is theres only about 8 tables along the window that gives a view of the amazing pool and shark tank. The buffet has the basic offerings of meat station, soup/salad bar, seafood and desert. The sections are small but are kept clean and well stocked. The only thing i didn't like was they heat lamps. There was a race to fill my plate and get to the table to eat before it got cold. I had the lobster mac which was a disappointment it tasted like box mac n cheese with imitation lobster and un-toasted panko crumbs. However collard green crab legs and cold shrimp were good! Only thing missing is burgers n fries for the kiddos",

The mimosa revived me, our server dropped off a huge carafe of coffee and made sure we were hydrated mama bear style. She joked a little, which was appreciated.  The food isn't bad, but it's not five star like some of the buffets. That's ok, because they don't charge five star prices.  It's a buffet like most buffets you've been to. Maybe a little better. But not the top tier. If you're staying in the hotel, it's a good spot. It's not a go out of your way place. It is a place of convenience, when you're lazy, hung over and checking out like we were.  But I like that, my boyfriend and my little situational adventures. Bloody Mary's that are spicy. Pineapple juice, and the offer of refills.  Fudge, I was going to give this place three stars, but that suggests it's bad. And it's not. It just is. The flux and flow of tourism. The changing hands of time. People have to work. In vacation, you need to eat.  Four stars friend.",

    "text": "The Lunch Buffet -$12   Even though it was Veterans Day & several local places were offering FREE Buffets for Vets (like myself) including the Main Street Station Casino right around the block, this was not on my agenda and I proceeded forward to try this one.   It didnt start off well as the elevator door kept opening up even though nobody was there to get on & it wasnt going down. So I took the escalator down to the gift shop & bought a paper & went back up to the buffet on the 2nd floor. NBD.   Then, once seated, there was the issue wt the lighting once again and I asked to be moved to a place wt better light so I could read my paper. I was gladly moved to a seat next to the full window overlooking the pool and its Aquarium, VERY COOL!! However, I did notice that at the pool ALL the guest were laying directly on the lounge pads & NO towel was being offered or laid out for them. I'm surprised as this is VERY unsanitary. Whatever, I'm not going there and laying on someone elses sweat & suntan lotion mess & its .NOT my problem.  At $12 it was a little pricey for lunch but FINALLY this buffet selections actually had some flavor to it, unlike the previous reviewed buffet. The Collard greens actually had real bacon in them and were very good & required no salt at all. The Beef Teriaki wt brocoli was actually \"over sauced\" & to rich but when mixed wt the Pepper, Onions & beef/chicken was very good and the perfect mix of all the ingredients blended together. And while there was no sushi (insert sad face here), there was shrimp cocktail wt medium sized pealed shrimp and a crab salad, both of which were not bad at all.  Also the Shreded  BBQ beef was very good and full of flavor. I didnt try the fried chicken or anything  from the carving station but it all looked real good and of a high quality.  The waitstaff didnt seem that friendly & helpful as my water glass went empty for quite sometime as they all casually walked by until a nice oriental lady offered to refill it even asking me if I wanted something else to drink . I didnt, but thanked her just the same.  The desert station wasnt that impressive and seemed to offer alot of mini cream puffs, cheesecakes, & the likes. I wasnt impressed at all and when I asked the lady scooping the ice cream what flavor one was she had no idea. LOL! I had a scoop anyway and I have NO IDEA what it was either (Maple? Butter Pecan? Carmel???) but it was good with a half slice of mini pecan pie.   Overall I'd say that out of the 3 buffets downtown, for lunch, this is the best and the table views overlooking the pool & aquarium rock and must really be sensational at night!!",

The roast beef had no flavor, the \"salisbury steak\" was grizzly and couldn't be chewed easily. You have to peel your shrimp, the chinese food was oil coated with gobs of salt for flavor. Really, the pizza wasn't bad but just limited choices of cheese, peperoni or sausage.  My mom is in her 60's and I in my 40\"s, and both agreed after more than 35 years of buffetting in Vegas...this was the worst for quality and price. We aren't that picky, but you can get much much better for a heck of a lot less. My advice is go anywhere else...you can't do much worse for this price.",

I'm usually not a fan of breakfast buffets because it's usually the same ol' heavy standard breakfast foods.  Everyone went the usual route of eggs, waffles, breakfast meats, etc. They all went to get custom-made omelets.  Normally, I would have been right there with them getting my favorite spinach-mushroom omelet but got distracted by other offerings in some of the other stations.  I went for the veggie mixes and was delighted to find a goat cheese-grape tomato mix.  (This was the main dish for me!)  Also had some grilled fish (mahi mahi?).  There were several sugar-free breakfast desserts to tempt me, but went with the yogurt-granola mix.  The lady serving our table took really good care of us.   Since it was still really early, there weren't too many other diners. So the atmosphere was pretty relaxed & enjoyable. I actually wouldn't mind coming back here.",

The bacon was limp, sausage tasted like it was cooked 2 days ago, the french toast was like chewing on a tire, eggs runny.  On the other hand, the ham at the cutting station was very good.  Now don't get me wrong cause I like a buffet, but this one is truly worth missing.",

I have to say were were very pleasantly surprised, this was much better than any buffet I have had in the past.   There was a large variety of food, mostly seafood but plenty for those of us that don't eat seafood. They had a baked chicken that was so moist and flavorful, I had to go back twice.   They also had your carving station with Turkey, beef and ribs, served with grilled veggies. Wonderful.. A build you own pasta bar was good, but be careful, it was a large serving.   The waiter was excellent, right on it with drinks and clearing plates.   The food was very fresh for buffet food, nothing seemed to be sitting for very long.. everything had that homemade taste..   I was so full I didn't get to try the dessert, they had a wonderful selections of cakes, eclairs and ice cream you could get on the cone or in a dish.",

I also got unlimited refills of orange juice and milk. I would definitely go back again! I would like to try lunch or dinner.

I lifted the metal lid off of the cream of mushroom soup and it was so hot that I had to set it down on the counter next to the pot. I scooped my soup into a bowl and I went to replace the metal lid back onto the pot but it was just so extremely hot that I automatically let go and the whole lid fell to the bottom of the mushroom soup. The woman behind the counter did see it all and came over while I apologized and she stuck her hand into the pot of cream of mushroom soup, retrieve the lid, wiped it off from A towel on the back counter and replaced it back on top of the pot. I mentioned to her she should not be serving that soup to anyone because it's now contaminated with the lid and your hand. She just ignored me and walked away. What else do they do that we don't catch? I know it happens  at all restaurants But when a customer catches it, they usually rectify it. I emailed the hotel and I left a message with the buffet manager because I was told there was not one on duty at the time. Have not heard a word back. Be careful. Be safe.",

It felt like we were being served by an English butler.   Shout out for the orange chicken, the omelettes, the roasted chicken very tender and moist. I loved their mac & cheese, and I think I am a mac & cheese snob.  My brother-in-law who works in the food industry said that they are using very good quality food.  Only a few of the items were not as fantastic, but they were still very tasty, just not as good as some of the others. Overall an excellent buffet.  Thank you Clinton for your excellent service.",

Atmosphere: The line to get in moves fast. Laid back and casual. Nice view of the pool if you choose to sit near the windows.  Cleanliness: No issues. Never had a dirty glass or piece of silverware here. The buffet is kept up and very clean.  Service: Diane is the best! We've been here about a dozen times and had her as our server every time. She's attentive, fun, easy-going, and brings you a smile when she brings you another mimosa. Love this girl a lot.  Food/Drinks: Bottomless mimosas. Need I say more? Seriously the best mimosas downtown. Champagne Brunch on Saturdays and Sundays for only $17. The meat carving station and the omelet station are both worth the wait. Really nice prime rib. The garlic chicken and spring rolls are my favorites for lunch and the eggs and corned beef hash are my faves for breakfast. Average salad selection, but you can throw together your own Caesar if you're feeling adventurous. The Dreyers Chocolate ice cream is truly the best ice cream ever. I'm not a big pastry fan, but if that's your bag, you'll probably like the selection. They have a ton of cookies and pastries to choose from. And they have this bread pudding with bourbon sauce that is pretty tasty. But let's be totally honest here. I come for the meats, eggs, and mimosas.  Price: Inexpensive. Especially if you play poker and get the comp. Play cards at their poker room for four hours and receive a $10 voucher to redeem at either the grill or the buffet. I recommend the buffet.",

I thought to myself, how awesome, I can stay in my hotel tonight and grab dinner without having to leave.  When my mother and I walked downstairs, we immediately new something was amiss, it was dinner time and the place was not packed!  Also, the ad in the magazine said crab, there wasn't any crab.  There were deserts, and to be honest, those are always hit and miss at any buffet.  They had sandwiches which was very weird, I've never seen sandwiches at a buffet.  The selection o food was very small, some prepared salmon and chicken dishes.  I ate primarily all the veggie dishes.  I was very upset because my mom rarely goes on vacation and this was a two night trip in which day one's dinner was a complete fail.  We didn't get our money's worth and with the prestige of the Golden Nugget we were expecting a far better dinner experience.  The only positive thing about this experience was the fact I could use my $15 food credit here and get the points loaded to my Landry's card.  I hope management really gets a hold on this place because they can be lining people up by the number to get in here, Vegas is synonymous with buffets, they could be the leader downtown.",

We had dined there a few years ago on Thanksgiving and the employees, including the cashier, the cooks, and the servers all seemed angry and rude so we stopped coming to your buffet.  Today it was wonderful.  Everyone was smiling!  We want to make a point of complimenting our server Carol from Pittsburg.  She was fast, efficient, and always smiling.  The ice cream dipper Michael Berryhill was so much fun that I think I'd come back to the buffet just for the ice cream service.  I noticed the employees were also nice to each other.  They were all moving so fast, I think they'd do well in a Nascar race and they never ran into each other or into any of the oblivious but happy diners.  There was plenty of Thanksgiving entrees to choose from.  I do think some of the warm foods could be a bit warmer.  The desserts actually tasted as good as they looked!  Thank you for making our Thanksgiving dinner experience perfect.  We are locals so we have tried many of the buffets in town.",

And i will never ever step a foot in that casino ever again. Old food that would make u throw up i had only salad because i was starving. Shame on such a hotel to have such a service",

Decidedly modest... but at least there was no wait.",

    "text": "Vegas is known for it's buffets but I was not impressed with the Golden Nugget Buffet. I called ahead to arrange seating for a wedding party of 15-20 people. When we got there we ended up having to sit at two different tables but I wil admit the wait time was less than 5 minutes.   Our drink orders were taken within 3 minutes and we were off to check out the buffet. And what I found was a very limited selection of items, in fact I will go so far as to say this was the most limited selection buffet I've been into in Vegas to date. But the thing that irritated me the most was that several of the stations had empty trays. As in no food. Some new items came out by the time we went back to check it again but it was too little, too late.   The live stations were also a disappointment. The meat carver was working with a ham that was about gone by the time we got there. And 2 other stations were unstaffed. But it got worse. The ham was tough to chew, and the sushi, beyond missing some tags to indicate what kind of rolls were being served was tough to bite into. In fact one could buy better, more edible sushi at your local Smith's than you would find here.   I honestly REGRET that I chose this buffet for the wedding party we were with, and there is no way, absolutely NO WAY I can recommend this buffet. The Golden Nugget has always been a good experience for me in the past, but I hope to never grace their 2nd floor buffet with my presence ever again.",

This waitress named Pamela had the most shitty attitude I have ever experienced here. Her answer to \"can u take these plates away please\" was \"can you wait I have drinks to deliver and you wanted coffee so I have to go make more\". If this is her attitude to service people she really should not do this any more. I understand about having an hard day and she is tiered , and elderly but so early in the morning and the place is not even full enough to call it busy just makes me feel unattended for and she has no people skills. Making her seem incompetent and she was very rude. Will not be coming here again along with my party of 23 people have been told as well.",

Yes, this isn't the show-stopping buffets that you expect to see in Las Vegas, but it doesn't come with the show-stopping price. It was about $12 a person and if you are lucky and have a buy one get one coupon, it is even cheaper. Six bucks for AYCE? That isn't bad. The trick is, stay at the hotel and they will give you coupons to eat at their restaurants.",

The wait in the short line was the worst part of the entire experience. There were 3 people ahead of us and it took 30 minutes to pay and get seated. The breakfast buffet was rated as one of the best buffets in the city for breakfast.  The  food was plentiful, freshly made tasty and hot. They had hot cereals, pancakes, waffles, every breakfast meat you can think of and beverages were included in the price. There was a surcharge for alcoholic beverages. Our waitress was kind and attentive.  I enjoyed this buffet and actually liked it better than the other breakfast we tried in the area that had ala carte pricing for less quality. I would return to this buffet",

We went on a Sunday, which was only $25.99 and it was Prime Rib night. One of the best tips to give is to go around 3:30pm because that is when they change from Brunch to Dinner. You will definitely get fresh dinner food! The waiter was also quick to take our finished plates, which I loved. The only negative outcome is that there was not a great section of seafood. They need more!  It is just right... not too fancy!  Atmosphere: 5/5 (Great view of the pool) Price: 4/5  Food: 4/5 (Need more seafood) Customer Service: 5/5",

During our recent stay in Vegas, my spouse and I came here twice for what was essentially brunch in the mid-afternoon. They've usually got a red meat roast on the carving station, along with something I wouldn't eat, like a roast turkey or some ham.   They have a little Chinese food and a little Mexican food, but nothing very good, very spicy or very interesting. There's the usual breakfast fare- eggs, bacon, sausage kind of stuff. I don't eat any of that really, but my hubs did and he said it was fine.   Now that I mention it, I think that word basically sums this buffet up nicely. It's fine.  It's not great. It's not spectacular, but it's just fine, especially if you're able to take advantage of a half price coupon Monday through Friday. :-)",

I tried some of the  corn beef hash, I had never tried it before because it has never looked good enough for me to eat, but this time it actually did but I must say I give it a 5/10. It was seasoned with way too much cumin. That was seriously all I tasted. So no. The employees were friendly but they kind of took too long to bring anything. I must say, the orange juice was freshly squeezed and that was the best part of it. I just look at it like I paid way too much for a cup of orange juice. I will not be going here again. :(",

Service friendly but not great; it took a long time to get drinks, we didn't get refills and a manager had to bus our plates.  The main cashier was RUDE, and would not speak to us.  Literally zero words, we asked her questions about our coupon and using our Laundry's card together, and she would not even look at us.  Just told us the total.  It was weird, not gonna lie, felt like we were beneath her to even answer our questions.  There was a long line and she took the card, so we just moved on but it sucked to be treated that way.  It was really crowded too, but only because it was hard to know what line to get in to get food.  It was a crowd around one area, then dash to go next; everyone was polite but no one ever knew who was next or what you were waiting for (omelet station to the left, scrambled eggs to the right, syrup to the middle....ayyy).  Even with a 2-1 coupon from the hotel,  this isn't worth it.  I'm on vacation, why eat gross food with bad to terrible service?",

    "text": "If you have a coupon or you are already in the Freemont Street area this place is good eats at a pretty decent price.  All of the food is tasty, though nothing is high dollar and nothing is particularly unique.  The main problem here is that the buffet is pretty small, where you might find 5-6 large stations at a buffet on the strip, this place has 3 + Desert.  If you count the bread and salad island it's 4 but that is a stretch.  The staff is friendly and pretty attentive.  they could be around a little more but Every time they passed me they checked my glass so it was more that they didn't come by as much as I would like, I didn't get ignored.  The seating here as uncommonly comfy, the chairs were well padded and as a fat bastard I appreciate being comfy while I inhale astonishing quantities of food.  All in all it was a solid mid grade affair.  I would go again if I were in the area.",

They have cold shrimp, muscles,and oysters; they were in water not ice and looked like they had been sitting out for at least 5 hours. Eek that's gross! I would spend the extra 5-6 dollars and go to the rio instead more food and it is defiantly safer to eat since they take more care of it as far as temp. Goes! I will never be back to this buffet! I guess ppl call it the toilet bowl buffet! Beware!",

    "text": "Ok for brunch. Nothing blew me away as great or super tasty, but nothing was really bad either. Omelet station was a bit messy because so many people were trying to push their way in,  but other than that is s petty simple lay out. Carving station, salad bar,  dessert. Not a huge selection, but it was enough.  I didn't even eat dessert. It looked good,  had ice cream ready to scoop, bread pudding,  napoleon's, I just didn't want sweets. Server was nice,  brought refills quickly, cleared plates. Tables were clean. Restrooms just outside and close to restaurant.  The sign to get in was a bit misleading because it said something about vip cardholders when we waited by the cash register a guy told us to wait behind the ropes (we were the only ones in line) I pointed out I thought it was the vip line & he said he didn't know why the sign was there,  but he didn't take it out. Lol. He looked like mgmt to me! Must not have been his \"job\" to take out the sign.",

I think it deserves 3 starts because you get your money's worth sit down and relax enjoy the pool view . You could go to another sit down restaurant and probably get fancier food but then again this is a good deal and I believe is the nicest buffet in  the old Vegas. So if you happen to be in downtown Vegas and you just gotta eat and don't want to wait till you get to the strip then eat here. Or if you have the funds to eat at a nicer restaurant in downtown Vegas then do so.",

    "text": "Our taxi cab driver recommended this place to eat. He said it was the best bang for our buck, he quoted us about $12 or $13 for lunch, however, it proved to be False. It turned out to be over $20! Since we already commited to walking all those stairs, we decided to give it a shot since the ladies guarantee us that dinner was about to start and some good seafood was coming out.  Right when we sat down, our waitress greeted us with bottomless mimosas! We quickly turned our frowns upside down, nothing like a little booze to cheer up our wallets.   The food was so so, I just snacked a bit here and there because I wanted the dinner seafood selection. Raw oysters and crab legs! I was the first person to attacked the tray of oysters and something smelled a little fishy. Should realized it was a bad omen, but I continued down the line and got a plate of crab legs. The crabs were delicious, but the labor was just not worth it. After I finished up the legs I went for the oysters, it tasted a little off and warm. Needless to say, it didn't measure up to par so I stopped eating it. As I reached for my mimosa to wash down the weird taste, I noticed I was low on refreshment. I realized we switch waitress and that bottomless mimosas were only during lunch and not dinner. How disappointing...  Next morning, I woke up with intense stomach pain. I think those warm, odd tasting oysters were not settling well in my tummy. Never eat raw oyster at a buffet or not chilled on ice.",

We went early and got to sit near the windows overlooking the pool.  It was a good people watching spot.  I enjoyed everything there, (especially the omlet bar, and the turkey sausage dipped in syrup- sad to say though- I DIDN\"T EAT ANY DESSERRTTTSSSS.  I was so full.",
