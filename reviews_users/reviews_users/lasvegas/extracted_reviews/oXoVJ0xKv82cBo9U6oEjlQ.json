I'm not sure that you can't actually even call the dish they brought me huevos rancheros. It was literally a plate with a greasy fried tortilla with scrambled eggs on top of it with a dollop of green salsa and a tiny little poop stain of black beans. Where's my beans, sauce and all that makes this dish yummy!? Now if you do decide to check out Chayo, here are the things to try: The chips and guacamole are great, the office margarita is my favorite, any of the three taco plates are great, and the chicken torta is good. The service is spotty and the prices are high, but it's at the LINQ, which I LOVE to hang out at, so the location is great and it you order right, you'll have a good time.",

My friend told me he was going to stop by this place to pick up some food. I told him to order me a burrito. He ordered the tacos for himself. Looking at the pictures, the food looks delicious. I would like to give this place a second chance. My food was tasteless. No flavor. I got the carnitas. The sauce on the side didn't help either. Bland taste. My friends tacos had also no flavor. I don't know if I'm missing something, but an $18 burrito better taste something like $18. Overpriced. I could of gotten way more better Mexican food for less. This was the closet thing since there was no taqueria near by my hotel.",

The manager has no clue what he's doing and does not pay attention to detail or touch tables. His staff is rude and the food is mediocre. My group and I approached the manager to leave feedback with him directly and his insincerity is what prompted me to write this. For the most part, his entire evening was spent with girls at the bar and giving the m free food. Maybe if I was a hot chick with big blobs he might have given my group better service. I suggest that you stay away from this place. Definitely better places on the strip.",

    "text": "I don't like giving poor reviews, but the quality of food for what they charge just isn't worth it.  I understand it's Vegas, but......  We were looking for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Saturday before catching our flight home.  Our normal spot, Hash House A Go Go, was absolutely packed and we didn't want to wait so we figure we'd try Chayo.  The ambience was nice and host staff friendly.    We were seated and ordered drinks.  I ordered a margarita, friend ordered a mojito.  My margarita was good, but her mojito was...well....yellow.  I've never seen a yellow mojito before.  She sent it back and when they brought her another one it looked (and tasted) like an actual mojito! I don't know what that first one was.    That was about the only positive part - decent (although expensive) drinks.  The food was less than mediocre.  My friend ordered a simple caesar salad with dressing on the side.  They brought her mayonaise.  Yes, mayonaise.  She asked for oil and vinegar instead, she was told they don't have oil and vinegar and brought her some citrus type stuff that again, was pretty much just mayo with lemon juice squeezed into it.  I've worked in enough kitchens and made enough dressings from scratch to know that most of the creamy dressings are mayo based, but it's NOT ALL MAYO!!!!!  Who wants to put mayo on their salads?  The salad itself - ugh.  The greens were very limp, not crisp.  Chicken was dry.    I ordered the tacos.  Very underwhelming.  They lacked flavor.  Sorry, not a fan.",

She was rude was  using foul language at an employee in front of us treated me and my spouse like we were trash didn't want to fix a mistake that was with our food. We have been to this restaurant many times and loved it but after our experience with her we will never come back if she's working. I can't believe that she thinks it's OK to treat her customers this way she's having a bad day or not that's not my fault and using foul language in front of my children is unexceptable and as someone who has employees my self I'd be livid if one of my managers ever talked to one of my other employees like that. So just make sure she isn't working if you want to have a good experience.",

So we asked another waitress...nothing....finally, our waiter came to give us our check and he was interrupted by yet another table who was unhappy with their service as well and took forever to run our card!!!

    "text": "Large space/restaurant in the Promenade. Have outdoor patio seating, with little fire/flame heaters going to keep everyone warm. Inside had a ton of tables available, it was dark, and to me it had a mixed vibe, partially intimate, partially sports bar.   I came here for the fish tacos -- grilled mahi mahi. WOW!   Fish was cooked perfectly, not overcooked at all. Three pieces.  The best thing was the green sauce that came with it. It was described as cilantro mayo, however, mine didn't look light enough or thick enough to have any mayo in it. At best, it seemed like a spicy cilantro blend. Regardless, it was addicting and I wish I had more of it. Served with rice and beans. But I didn't get beans, I got chili instead. Enjoyed the rice compared to the taco dish I had from Yolos in Planet Hollywood. The rice was well cooked, had some moisture and flavor to them as opposed to dry, crunchy bits of old or under cooked rice.   I have to agree with a few other Yelpers, regarding how long it took to get the food. I had one dish, and it took close to a half hour to get. The  bartender who took my order said it would be out quickly, but even she knew it was taking awhile because she said kept saying it would be out soon, and then later on she said she would check on it.   I think everyone is nice, but the kitchen must be understaffed or very confused. By the time I got my order, the runner or bus boy came up to me and apologized, said that he confused my order and gave it to the other people before me who had also gotten takeout. What?! And I think that they had made that mistake, because on my receipt stapled to my takeout bag, were the words \"RUSH RUSH RUSH\". And honestly, fish tacos are not a hard order. Grill small chunks of fish, as opposed to having them breaded/deep fried. Throw on the red cabbage, which I assume is pre-sliced. Put everything no a corn tortilla and you're good to go! Sauce, chili, rice packaged on the side. At most, 5-10 minutes to assemble.   In the afternoon, past lunch hour rush (if there is even a lunch hour rush in a tourist place that has diners at all hours of the day), there were only a handful of diners, and most of that handful was at the bar area. They should not be backed up on orders, nor should a simple dish take so long to make.   However, the bartenders were friendly and attentive, aware that I was waiting, and consistently checked up on me. The runner was apologetic about the wait. The food was delicious, hence the 3 stars.",

We already knew what we were ordering. So we ordered our appetizer, drinks and our meals. Well we order chips and salsa, four dinners and four drinks. So this is how the order came....waters were brought, but the waiter after telling us sorry about the wait I was in the back....ummm ok.....then our main dishes, yes, our meal was brought out first. Then our drinks, then lastly our appetizer of chips and salsa. Really our appitzer comes our after all our other things. That was definitely not worth the cost of them. I was rather dissappointed with this experience and will probably not recommend this place to others . The meal was so so it was presented ok but was rather bland and for Mexican food I have actually had way better. I would try other Mexican places on the strip and use this as a last place to go.

We ordered drinks and food.  Drinks and food came at the same time 30 minutes after ordering. Very disappointing I did have high hopes for this place and it didn't live up to the hype.  A Mexican restaurant with no complimentary chips?",

First, the restaurant is short staffed, they sell street food but you're not allowed to sit down and eat THEIR food in THEIR patio!  WT?...??  Guacamole is good. The chili relleno stuffed with shrimp is great. Tortilla soup is DEL-I-CIOUS!  The ppl that work the street food area are AWESOME!!!  Especially the gentleman dressed in the taco suit!  The hostesses is SUB-PAR. Our waitress was nice and the busboy was quick to bring drinks and clean tables. THIS PLACE GETS A CRAPPY SCORE OF 3 due to THEIR LACK OF PROVIDING MORE ACCOMMODATING SERVICE WHEN THEY ARE SHORT STAFFED and not allow customers eat FOOD PURCHASED FROM THEIR RESTAURANT TO BE EATEN ON THEIR PREMISES!!!  NO BUENO!!  SORRY NOW I HAVE TO CHANGE MY RATING TO 1 STAR DUE TO BAD ATTITUDE on waitress and  manager!!!!!",

The table behind us was getting regularly check ins by the waitress as it is.   When we finally  were able to get someone's attention, he goes \"you can get up to get your drinks.\" We looked puzzled and he continued with \"the kitchen is closed. You can go to the bar.\" I then responded with \"that's great to know considering no one came up to us in the past half hour.\" Then he walked away, clearly upset.   Not ever have I been blatantly ignored. Would have been courteous after having seen us sitting there, to come up and inform us that we would not be able to order food and that this restaurant had basically turned into a club.",

We loved the atmosphere- great music playing, beautifully set up bar, and a bull in the middle that's free to ride- just tip the guy.  We ordered a few appetizers to start which were the ceviche and the queso. The ceviche was ehhh ok- 3 stars. It was really thick and needed a little more spice to it. The queso was great! We really enjoyed that. It came with only 4 small tortillas- it needed to have more because of the amount of queso you receive. For dinner my friend and I shared the carnitas tacos. They were decent/ the rice and beans that came with it were very bland- definitely not home made. Two of our other friends got the lobster tacos and the steak quesadilla.   We got a few drinks and mine was the peach margarita/ it was yummy! The service was lacking we didn't have any utensils or extra plates when the appetizers arrived.   Decent place overall.",

Once was at night around 1pm when this places turns into a club with a mix of hispanic and hip hop music, we sat outside so we were able to eat food since we had just got off the plane about a hour ago. It was fun in that we felt the club vibe but still able to order food and drinks. The beers were around 7-9 bucks and drinks were around 9-15 bucks. The pear cider that I wanted was out so I opted for a sangria instead, which whooooo turned out strong and delicious! Our group also ordered the fish tacos and carnitas tacos, both orders come with rice and beans.   Our second visit was in the morning for breakfast. Around 10am, it was fairly busy but with no wait. The chayo breakfast for two suited us perfectly for $26 bucks. The only thing I would NOT recommend at all is the freshly squeezed Orange juice. That thing is a joke! It was 5 bucks for a small glass full of ice and watered down orange juice. The salsa here though was great, a little bit of a kick and chunky, just like how good salsa should be!",

My kids had the tacos de Asada and the chicken burrito and they enjoyed them both. Or at least I didn't hear any complaints.  The location was nice, service was prompt and our sever Armando was very courteous and welcoming.  I felt the meals to be a bit on the pricey side maybe a good place for drinks and appetizers.",

She sent over the waiter who never apologized for his lack of attention to us. The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Plus the waiter did not even come by once to see if we needed anything after our food was delivered - never refilled our drinks or anything. We could see him off in the distance talking to other waiters!  The gentleman who delivered our food said he would bring over some homemade salsa and that never happened either!! That probably was the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant! Don't go there!!",

We asked the female bartender what shot she recommended and she said she was the wrong person to ask because she only drinks $85.00 dollar shots!!! She was rude!! And to top it off we asked if they knew about the Mexican lollipop shot and she looked at us in disgust and asked another bartender and he responded saying \"tell them they can get it in MEXICO!!!  This place is HORRIBLE!!!! Never again!!",

They say us down in a good manner which was pretty impressive until we got sat.  It took 5 minutes before someone took care of us. I don't what's going on with the server who's supposed to be in that section but we ended having someone else taking care of us. She was the superhero at that moment. After that, everything went smoothly and the food was great but I was disappointed with the chicken fajita. It normally comes with rice and beans but our server told us that it was an additional charge. Anyway, the food is great.",

That's like an Asian restaurant without rice.   Way way way over priced. The Manager should be talking more to the customers and less time talking/flirting with hostesses . Busboy and server was amazing .  They need to lower your price and improve quality. Your next to Oshays beer pong place is packed.  Beautiful restaurant  Nice china.",

Just like cockroaches aren't a memorable experience to have in your first apartment, so is this establishment known as Chayo. The only reason this place is receiving a two star treatment is because of our friendly waiter and it's prime location. And that's as good as it gets here! Thinking about getting a juicy plate of fajitas and skirt steak that melts in your mouth was but a childish dream when the real thing came out. The fajitas were absolutely bland, having absolute no taste to them and the skirt steak was incredibly dry and had no flavor. Chewing on my t shirt would've been easier on my disappointed tastebuds and my teeth. The flavor had so much potential but the chef lacks the vision. Such a travesty as it is in a very very fantastic location. That this place remains opens seems but the many mysteries of the world that exist. My best bet, the alcohol and rooftop bar keeps them open. The food ? Perhaps we were mistaken when the food was meant to be served for  \"humans\" maybe next time I'll bring my dog here to eat when we want to take her out. But then again that means she is being punished. Awful",

    "text": "So here is the honest truth about this resturant. The food is great... HOWEVER... they have the worst customer service. Everyone that works there has an attitude and no-one smiles. They constantly mess up your order..... Oh not to mention if you work at hotel or surrounding hotels and go in to get food... They treat you even worse... They act annoyed to service you and if they see you are in uniform they give you less amount of food because they had to give you a discount!!! Such poor attitudes and THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. THEY DONT REALIZE THAT WE RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO THEM!!!! I hope the owner and manger read this and have a response.... Because I am in management and I would want to know if my employees had such poor and horrible attitudes and customer service!!!",

However i thought the food would be better. I live in Arizona & am used to good Mexican food.  We sat at the bar & waited about 10 minutes before anyone took our drink order or gave us menus. Once we ordered the food arrived quickly though.  I got nachos. They were not good. They used canned processed cheese that practically ruined the dish. My husband got a carme asada burrito & he said the meat tasted more like ground beef instead of actual carne asada.  Needless to say we won't be back. If you want good mexican food go to Roberto's just off strip.",

It's located just off the strip, attached to the Linq hotel and casino. It was our last night in Vegas and this was definitely the perfect way to end the trip.   The chips and queso, with chorizo added, were fantastic. The big chunks of chorizo were seasoned really well and the queso was creamy.   I had shrimp fajitas with a side of street corn for my main course. The street corn was awesome! I love street corn, and this stuff was done well.   The BF ordered a steak. He really enjoyed it and mowed it down pretty quickly.   The drinks were exceptional. I had the pear mule. The pear flavor was really fresh and stood out. It wasn't at all overwhelming, it was just right.   Service as well was great! Our server was quick and attentive.",

The manager came out to apologize and without our knowledge wrote it off our check so, with our groupon we were actually under cost and were able to all enjoy in our own desserts. I would definitely recommend Chayo's for location, quality of food and service. The desserts were delicious and everything we tried from the Al Pastor chicken burrito to the Tortilla soup and short rib enchiladas were all thoroughly enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon not too overcrowded and not too posh or adult themed for my teenager and preteen. I would have loved to see someone riding the mechanical bull situated in the middle of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Had the BEST experience with my family.   We had a dinner & show package, and there was some confusion between our waitress and the kitchen so we waited for our food for a while. Really was not a big deal. The manager came over and took complete responsibility for the miscommunication, and offered to comp our first round of drinks ($45!).   The food came out shortly afterwards and was delicious. My family is from South Texas and can be really picky about Mexican food; everyone loves their meal. The pork in my chile verde tacos was so tender and flavorful and the flan was so creamy. May be some of the best flan I've had, it was delightful. Additionally, our waitress and the manager made for wonderful conversation.  The food was wonderful and customer service even better. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience after a small hiccup. Would love to come back next time I am in town.",

The margaritas were definitely too salty but I was so happily impressed with the food and portions.  *Review edited to add picture and following statement:  Customer service was amazing after the initial wait!",

Let's start with enjoyable side of my visit at Chayo's. The restaurant is spacious, very nice, clean and a great atmosphere for family/group gatherings.  The waitresses were decent, not overly nice nor rude. The food was decent, but nothing to brag about. ordered a Sangria, and it was VERY good! Very refreshing and decently priced.   Now, let's get to the problem with this place...My visit with my group of 15+ allowed for plenty of feedback to know well enough it was not just me who felt this way...Ordered the Ceviche appetizer ($14) and was stunned by how small my appetizer was. I'm talking, almost offensive! Noticed that ALL the appetizers were unbelievably small and the entrees were also small, slightly bigger than the appetizers. The Churros ($10) were pretty good, and came with a expresso sized hot chocolate (Abuelita) which was awesome because it's almost unheard of for a Mexican restaurant to serve \"chocolate abuelita!\"   These portions were more like Tapas. Don't come here too hungry....",

I knew there was something wrong  with it, but others thought that's just the way it was supposed to be.  Then about ten minutes later, our waiter said,the bartender accidentally made two of your drink with grand mariner, want another one for free?   Sure!  The second one, was waaaaaay better, proving the first drink was made wrong.  So trust your instinct and return that nasty tasting margarita.

It's located in the new \"LINQ\" area of Vegas next to Harrah's and the old casino where they used to have the impersonator singers.  Now they revamped it to try to be more classy and it's just as horrible.  I think they just painted over the smoke and filth.   The only good thing about this place was a.) I didn't pay for it, the company did  b.) when I was leaving it was cold outside and for a second I walked under the outside heat lamp....ahhh warmth.",

The rib eye - rare when we asked for medium.   3. Fajitas were ok, looked like a mess on the plate. Beans are directly from a can and just reheated.    4. The chicken enchiladas - frozen? Hot in the middle and very cold on the edges. The entire meal was basically luke warm.   5.  The corn is just slathered on one side with salty slightly lime barely spicy dump in cheese.   6. When asked what the guajillo sauce tasted liked the answer was \"I couldn't even begin to describe it.\" Really?!?!  7. No refills on the Arnold Palmer.   8. Took 10 minutes for the check to be picked up and our card run through.   Don't bother with this place for a meal. It may just be good enough for booze and chips and salsa.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here to celebrate our two-year wedding anniversary. We were, of course, expecting an awesome experience for such a special occasion, but, unfortunately, we were thoroughly disappointed!  Upon first entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised by the modern decor and atmosphere. The hostesses were nice and we were seated promptly. The waiter was at our table immediately and asked if we were interested in drinks; my wife needed a few minute to look over the drink options and the waiter did not make any recommendations. I asked what kind of beers were available and he stated they had Dos Equis Amber, Lager, and Lite; I wasn't unaware that Dos Equis had a Lite version, so, thinking it was something new, I ordered it (more on this later).  The waiter returned shortly after with our drinks, chips and salsa (which were okay), and laminated menus... yes, cheap, one-sided, laminated menus in a restaurant that charges $25+ per entree. The menu did not have as many items as we expected and the descriptions for each item were extremely vague. We decided to start with the chorizo sopes and Mexican street corn. Both items were brought to our table after about 5 minutes and were both actually pretty tasty, but not mind blowing. Now, back to the Dos Equis \"Lite\"; I was actually given a Lager and when I informed the waiter that I ordered a Lite, he said that Lager is the lite. WTF, right?  Shortly after the appetizers were delivered, our waiter returned for our entree order. He didn't seem to know much about the items and had no recommendations. I ordered the chicken torta and my wife ordered the beef filet fajitas. There's an item called Yucca fries and, when I asked the waiter what those are, he said, \"I think they're like sweet potato fries.\" I decided to order those, as well.  The entrees didn't take too long to come out; after taking our first bites, my wife and I wished they had never come out. My chicken torta consisted of flavorless chicken, avocados, and way too much black bean paste; it was served with spinach on the side... just plain spinach with a drizzle of some unidentifiable substance, which I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put on my torta or eat as a salad. My wife's fajitas were equally as flavorless and the beef was extremely chewy. In fact, if there were such a thing as negative flavor, these dishes would qualify. Oh, and the Yucca fries, which the waiter \"thought\" were sweet potato fries, were just regular steak fries, also with no flavor.  The waiter came by to ask how our food tasted and I let him know that we thought our food was flavorless, which is something I have never done, but this food was so bad, I felt compelled to do so. I asked if he could bring out some hot sauce or something to add some flavor; even salt and pepper would've improved these dishes! He stated that all they had was Tabasco. Now, this is supposed to be a Mexican restaurant, which means it should have its own house hot sauce or at least Cholula or Tapatio, but nope, just Tabasco.  Apparently, our displeasure upset the waiter and he was rude for the remainder of our dinner; like it was our fault the food was bad! I promptly asked for the overpriced bill and left absolutely no tip, also something I had never done.  I highly recommend that NO ONE SHOULD EAT HERE! I honestly would've rather eaten at Chevy's.",

I gathered from the stink face said chubby waiter was giving us, that it was not. I went to the hostess and of course she said she would let our waiter know that we are out there. He showed up, threw a few menus at the table and walked away.  The menu had standard americanized Mexican food. We opted for steak fajitas ($25), 3 mini lobster tacos ($12) side of cilantro rice ($5) and a Puncho Villa jalapeno tequila mixed drink ($14). The fajitas were okay - IMO they should have come with rice - which was better than the fajitas. The \"lobster\" tacos should be relabeled as batter fried bits with lobster flavor. Absolutey awful. The chips and salsa were the best thing on the menu and they were FREE!  The bus boy was very nice and attentive but that chubby waiter really needs to think about another career choice.",

Since it was nice outside, my fiance and I asked if we could be seated outside. The view was great and it didn't take long for us to be greeted by our server who was really nice. The menu is small, and like other reviews have said, the descriptions for each item are vague. We both decided to order tacos ($16 for each order) thinking they would be the bomb dot com. SIKE. They were terrible. Very bland. You can honestly get better tasting food from Robertos and save more than half than what we spent.",

I decided to go with the 50 Shades of Chayo drink, and a chorizo burrito, while my husband stuck with water and ordered the steak burrito. With them being so busy our food came out surprisingly quick and it was hot and delicious. The onlyyy bad thing I have to say was I would have liked a little more cheese on my burrito. And yes, too little cheese dictates a star knock off. The drink was really good too. But for a $14 drink I would expect just a little bit more of it. Especially when drinks are free when you're gambling. All in all, I was pretty satisfied. Would definitely go again next time we're in town. But next time......... we're gettin the nachos.",

All of which were not worth 15$  We ended up leaving after there was no good vegaterian options and no solution was offered.   When we said we're were going to leave our server did Zero to change our minds.   I give it one star because we did get chips and Salsa and the Salsa was good.  The chips were not so great.    I would definitely never recommend this over priced place to anyone... Walk down the road to The yard house for a great menu,  healthy options and 150 beer selection.  And better prices.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to visiting this restaurant, especially since I won a gift certificate for this establishment.   I arrived with 3 others, we requested to be seated and it took roughly around 15 minutes to seat us, reasonable for a Saturday night. First thing I noticed as we began to walk in was the music playing. A but loud for me. We were seated and our server, whose name was Juan as well, was very courteous, jovial and attentive. We placed our order of some drinks, apps and entrees.  Our drinks arrived in a timely fashion and were quite delicious. No holding back on the alcohol here my friends! Our apps arrived which consisted of some pork sopes. I was a bit disappointed when they arrived. The sopes were sitting in a pool of lard which made the tortilla of the sope extremely greasy. I understand traditional Mexican sopes are cooked in a small bit of lard for flavor and to crisp it up a bit but this was nothing like that. The seasoning on the meat was good but couldn't really enjoy them much. Our entrees arrived. I personally had the beer battered lobster tacos and had a carnitas taco. The carnitas taco was good but the meat was a bit too dry. Flavors were there but there was a big lack in moisture in the protein. Now for the lobster tacos. I had trouble with these tacos because they seemed to be double salted. As a culinary student it seemed as though the lobster had been cooked and salted prior to frying it, then salting the lobster again after frying. Not too satisfying to the palette. One if my friends had the Manchego Burger. It was ordered medium rare and arrived that way. It was described to be a very delicious and juicy burger. Ad we asked for the bill and prepared to pay, we noticed the music growing louder. This was another problem whole dining as we had to raise our voices to speak to each other comfortably.   I believe this establishment is decent. I can't honestly say that I will raving about it but, I will say that everyone should at least try it out. Maybe your experience may be different than mine.",

When we finally did get the waiter and explained we never received our food, all he said was \"dahhh, do you want me to take it off your bill??? REALLY?

    "text": "I was excited to learn that there was a new Tequila Bar in town and my boyfriend and I visited Chayo on a Friday afternoon for his birthday.  Chayo is easy to access if you park at the Flamingo, as you land right at the doors of Chayo when you exit the casino.  Chayo is beautifully decorated and a great place to people-watch.  Although other reviews state that the service was poor, we didn't experience this.  Our server was Masih and he was very attentive and entertaining.  In terms of ambiance, I'd give Chayo 5 stars.  In terms of food and beverage, it gets 3 stars.  Let me explain: 1) the cups seemed dirty and water spotted, which prompted me to ask for a straw; 2) We ordered chips and salsa and the salsa was tasty; 3) Empanadas were $10 as an appetizer and they were delicious; 4) street corn was a side for $8 and it was also tasty; 5) the Sangria ($10) left a lot to be desired as it didn't even have any pieces of fruit in it; the house Margarita was actually good at $14, and shots of other various tequilas were a bit over priced.  We went with the intention of trying a few different tequilas, but at $14+ dollars per shot, we only had one!  We tried the Avion Silver which was good.    All in all, one shot, one margarita, one Sangria, chips and salsa, street corn, and an appetizer brought our bill to $67.  We didn't even get to the main courses!  I probably wouldn't go back to Chayo until they get realistic with their prices.",

There were plenty of empty tables in the dining room but she said there would be a 15 mins wait cause the servers are swamped right now. I noticed empty seats at the bar and asked if that was open seating. So we grabbed 2 seats at the bar. Took a little while for bartender to get to us. It wasn't that busy. There's about 20 seats at the bar with 3 bartenders and 1 Barback.  We asked food menu for quick appetizers.  Bartender came back after about 5 min took our food our. We ordered ribeye tacos and lobster tacos.  $12 per order for 3 small street tacos. Bartender took our food order and then disappeared.  Didn't offer us water or asked if we wanted a cocktail.  We finally got the other bartender's attention and asked for water. After about 10 mins our tacos arrived. It was suppose to come with chips n salsa. We asked 1st bartender for chips n salsa. He said he'll check on it. We started to eat the tacos. They looked really good. Very disappointed with these over priced street tacos. The tortilla was cold. Ribeye was over cooked and cold. The lobster was deep fried but it was cold. Everything was bland. Oh and we never got our chips n salsa. We asked for the check. It took quite awhile for bartender to get us our check also. It wasn't busy but bartender seemed overwhelmed.  Overall very disappointed with service and quality of food. Most likely won't ever return or recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "A group of us came here to celebrate a friend's promotion. We came in early and sat at the bar as we waited for the rest of the party. Drink prices are standard for a Strip location. As a Mexican restaurant they are known for their margaritas and have a menu that highlight their various concoctions. I had wanted to try a couple of them, but they did not have certain components to make them. I went with a micholada and it was good. They didn't have clamato, so they just used bloody mary mix instead. They offered us chips and salsa after our second drink. The seasoning on those warm chips makes for crack.  Once we were seated, it took some time for us to get service. 10 minutes pass and no one showed up. 15 minutes goes by and still no one. We were told the server didn't know he had the table. Honest mistake. Eventually, our server did come. We had some issues with what was in stock. I had wanted 2 different kinds of whiskey, but they didn't have either.   Food wise: The appetizers were delicious. We got the ceviche, a queso fundido, chicken tacos, and the guacamole. The fish was tender and seasoned well. The acidic component mellowed out with the use of cucumbers. The queso was okay. The chorizo didn't give as much of a kick as I was hoping. The fact that they serve it in a iron skillet allows the cheese to crisp on the bottom. Scraping up all of it and eating it is half the joy. I didn't try the tacoes, but the others seemed to enjoy it. The guacamole was probably my favorite. The put pomegranate seeds on top. It gave it a touch of tart and sweetness that was the most unique item on the menu. As for entrees, nothing was spectacular. The sweet corn enchiladas were a decent vegetarian option, but lacked a countering flavor, so it was just sweet. The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy. I just wouldn't come to a Mexican restaurant and think burger. My friend enjoyed his chicken torta. I stole a bite of the chicken enchiladas and weren't impressed.  One of our party members paid before they left and it took some time to get our waiter to come back. We had still wanted to order some more drinks, but by the time he came back we were ready to leave. I know they are still new and will eventually work out the kinks.",

    "text": "Worst. Service. Ever. It took 15 minutes just to take our drink order - we were about to get up and walk out when the waiter suddenly appeared so we decided to give it a chance. After we ordered drinks, it took at least 10 minutes to get the drinks (2 beers and a sangria) and then an additional 5 minutes for my friend to get her cup of what was a very lousy coffee. We ordered guacamole, and by the time we got it we had no chips left, and it took 15 minutes to get chips. Our waiter just kept just disappearing, and the manager was too busy chatting up the hostesses to actually pay attention his patrons. The food was decent, but I would NEVER go back because of the terrible service. We left the waiter $1 tip - he's lucky he got that.",

We ordered (too much food) chips and salsa,guacamole and pork rhinds, with pomegranate seeds on top  :), the steak fajitas - cactus pieces were found in the mix, and they came with a sizzling piece of corn on the cob to our enjoyment! The tortilla soup was  just so so; it had a weird flavor and the small portion was definitely NOT worth $8!  Overall, the food was good but a bit overpriced (but hey, it's Vegas, right?!).",

The happy hour mini nachos, are by no means mini. They are great to share with someone, tasty with fresh ingredients for only $5! Most of their happy hour foods are $5 per plate. We saw the taquitos being catered out, and those looked delicious as well. The upstairs rooftop patio is better for seating than inside. Inside tends to be pitch dark.",

They updated their breakfast menu but didn't update or take off old menu items, ordered breakfast skillet and then after waiting 10 minutes later was told they couldn't make my order and I had to order something else. I think the waiter should have known this and told me right away instead of waiting and having to reorder. Saving grace is the salsa it's amazing. Nice atmosphere for drinks, but disappointed in the change in the food.",

The rice was not a Mexican rice but rather just plain steamed white rice, which was ok with me but was strange. The pinto beans meh..

    "text": "We came for Matt Franco and a dinner show on one ticket. Little did we know when we bought the dinner addition it was a \"pre-fix\". The prefix is when they give you a choice of only a few dinners. My partner had veggie enchiladas and I had chicken soft tacos. Her enchiladas were stuffed with butternut squash and we're so insipidly sweet they were almost inedible. My tacos were served on a rack and the corn tortillas had been steamed. As a result, the bottoms fell totally apart when I try to pick them up so I had to eat my tacos on the plate with a fork. Now I think the most frustrating part about having a \"prefix\", was the fact that they would not bring us any extra of the usual condiments in a Mexican restaurant. I asked the waiter before the meal came out if we could have a little extra salsa, he looked at me in a very puzzled manner and never did answer me and never did bring any salsa. In fact when I had my initial salad I asked a server for pepper. Again I never even got pepper! We even offered to pay for chips and salsa and again got that puzzled look from the waiter. The food was average, but I like to hold my taco in my hand and my partners food was so one note and sweet that some salsa would help to elevate it or even a long time. Just not as impressed as I wanted to be it was over $60 when all was said and done. Certainly won't come back here when there's better Mexican food of the strip.",

Not being funny but seriously... where to begin... there were four of us. first we get sat down and we had been at the pool all day so we were super thirsty, told the server jokingly \"we're super parched\" he said cool got you....we also ordered cocktails at the same time, never got water, had to ask a busser, busser brought three waters after 30 min, my husband still hadn't got his drink, when his drink came (it was a bloody beer) it was flat and warm. We ordered a app of calamari... it came, it was burnt, taste like cardboard... Lance the server said no biggie, and got us a fondido with chorizo, (still haven't had our order taken) we also asked for extra tortillas, that never happened.... lance came back about 20 minutes later and said sorry he had to take an order of 100, and pointed to a party of 12 in the back... that's cool... we understand, he might be new... I told him don't worry about the tortillas we're just ready to order.... ok one of us ordered the nachos with chorizo... food came about 45 minutes later, no chorizo, mine was cold (diablo shrimp) , he finally checked on us... we told us the problem reluctantly and he took my food, never asked if I wanted something else... just walked away. I asked him if Cesar was the new executive chef... lance said he honestly doesn't know, he's not allowed in the back... wtf haha ok bud... poor lance...  last.... I asked where the bathroom was after we payed the bill ($120 apx) they told us sorry you gotta go next door at the flamingo... errr k... we just left.... suck suck suck.... smh next time we will just stick to bar food at the tilted kilt or off the strip... we love the linq...\"GOD DAMMIT LANCE!\" .... a visit to giggle about... not all his fault.... probably bad training",

    "text": "On New Year's Day, my family and I came here for breakfast but they didn't only served lunch and dinner. There were vintage orange cushion leather booths and wooden tables surrounding a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant was decorated with hollow lights, colorful skulls, crosses, and prints of bulls.   The drinks especially the Pina Colada and Sangria were very strong! The Pina Colada, which consisted of rum, pineapple juice and coconut cream, tasted like medicine due to excessive rum. I asked them to make a lighter and more sweet version of it. The second was better than the first. The Sangria consisted of red wine, brandy, and fresh fruit juices. They were garnished with strawberry and orange.   For appetizers, I'd recommend the Guacamole (and tortilla chips), Yucca Fries, Botana Platter, and Caesar Salad. The Guacamole dip consisted of fresh avocado, diced onions, parsley, and garnished with pomegranate seeds. Some of the tortilla chips were seasoned with spices. The Yucca Fries were deep fried, thickly cut yucca. The Botana Platter consisted of two mini pork chorizo and black bean sopes topped with radish, two crispy corn, poblano pepper, and cheese empanadas, and two chicken, cheese, shredded lettuce, and sour cream gorditas. The Caesar Salad consisted of fresh romaine lettuce and parmesan cheese tossed in a creamy anchovy dressing. The other guests in our party ordered Beer Battered Lobster Tacos and Sweet Corn Enchiladas. The Lobster Tacos, which came in 3 and consisted of beer battered lobster, beans, red cabbage, and topped with chipotle mayo. The Sweet Corn Enchiladas which came in 4, consisted of sweet corn, cheese, green peppers, and mushrooms, and topped with cascabel sauce, sour cream, and chives. It's a perfect option for a vegetarian!",

Super sweet, fast, checked in with us and always made sure our drinks were refilled. The food is really good but she made the experience memorable!!!! If you go ask to be seated with her- she'll make sure you're taken care of! If you're reading this,thanks for the incredible service Christina!!!!!!",

    "text": "We were pretty much shunned and blacklisted for using a groupon lol. Horrible customer service, food wasn't much better. Literally the first time in my life i haven't left a tip. I've been living here for close to 10 years, always eat out at restaurants, and work in the industry down the road dealing with guests on a daily basis and i always auto-tip even if the service is terrible, NOT THIS TIME. The food wasn't as bad as the service we received (would be pretty hard to top) but i would say its pretty average mexican food at best. Told our server we were using a groupon and she tried talking us out of using it for some reason?? Had i known now the service using a groupon gets you i would've gladly paid whatever, not the point though. Waitress never told us her name (wish she had now so i could put it in here) and once we were done haggling with her about the groupon she took our orders and that was literally the last we heard from her. Never checked on us once, we had to flag down a bus boy to bring us plates, we waited forever, and then all the food came out together. When's the last time you've been to a mexican restaurant and they brought out the chips and salsa at the same time as your entree, think about that? The best part was when the food runner came out and was like \"oh, you guys are the groupon right\" as if she had gone back and announced it to the kitchen like the beverly hillbillies or cheapskates were here. Manager on the way out seemed like he already knew who we were talking about as he didn't ask for her name. He offered us free drinks and stuff for next time which was nice but unfortunately there will be no next time... Sucks too because i really wanted to like this place.",

Our server ignored us for the rest of the night and we had to literally ask him if we could order our entrees. The tacos we got were so dry and we didn't want to even eat them except that it took so long to get them that we were starving! Afterwards, we asked for the manager and he did give us a discount and made the server apologize, but it came off so fake and he didn't even bother to make up a fake excuse for his attitude... I would not come back here ever, nor would I recommend it to anyone, local or visiting!",

    "text": "Came here 1/4/14 with a rather large group for dinner without reservations. From  the outside it looks great! Stone front, heaters and outdoor seating. Once inside, it is a very intimate setting with dim lights, like that of \"fine dinning\". This place, mind you, is brand spankin' new! Even has the new smell. So far so good right?   Wellllll, for starters my group ordered a \"pitcher\" of Mexican Mule. Took awhile to recieve our pitcher, and when we did receive it, I was not happy with what I saw. First off, they bring out several glass with filled with ice and a straw of course. Secondly, the so called \"pitcher\" is not how I imagined it, like a traditional beer pitcher, but oh well. Thats not the really problem. What I was not happy with was the fact that the pitcher was more than half way filled ice (mind you there was already ice in the glass they brought). Basically this pitcher is really ice on ice! Equivilent of 3 and a half drinks! The drink was good, I give them that. But I had to remove the ice from the pitcher and poor the rest of the cocktail into a seperate glass, because the ice in the pitcher kept pouring out.  Now, the food. I ordered the Flank Steak with Yucca Fries and Chimichurri. And it was just, it just fell short. The steak was cooked well done but it had no taste. Even though it says \"chimichurri\", those flavors were nonexistent. The only tasty thing on my plate was the yucca fries. The Boyfriend ordered the Pork Sopes, which I did in fact try, the chorizo was way overcooked, and greasy. Very unpleasant to say the least.  Our servers were great, I cannot deny that. Overall Chayo's food is very bland, under seasoned and pitcher drinks are not worth it at all.",

After the High Roller, we walked down expecting out rooftop patio to be all ready for us at Chayo (as I requested in my reservation). I called several days before the reservation to confirm the patio. When we arrived, the server brought us into the restaurant and sat us in the main area. I asked to speak with the bar manager, Cary, and he informed me that the patio was closed. I was frustrated that no one had called to inform me that my reservation had changed, and Cary completely understood. He actually opened up the rooftop patio just for our group!   AWESOME customer service and way to make the night special. We had the whole patio to ourselves, amazing server Malorie was on top of everything, and the food was good. It turned out to be the perfect setting for us!   The food is worthy of 4 stars. Service is worthy of 5 stars! Environment gets 5 stars. Unknown staff that failed to follow up with me regarding my reservation gets 1 star.  I will return next time I'm in Vegas!",

Clearly Chayo didn't get the memo that chips and salsa are free with purchase of an entree.  You know, like every other Mexican place on Earth.  By the way, the bill was $114 + the $20 bill I put along with my debit card - the server assumed this was his tip and didn't apply it to the bill.  Brilliant.  I was going to write your tip on the GRATUITY line.  When I ordered the triple berry mojito, I requested no mint; the passive-aggressive male server got closer to me and stated \"then it's not a Mojito\" - As if I was critiquing his personal recipe.  I don't care if it's a Mojito or not and I really don't care to talk about cocktail semantics with you; just take my order and go away.  I repeated that I didn't want mint leaves in my drink, which he again replied \"then it's not a Mojito...\"  I ended up ordering the $14 cocktail with the mint leaves that I didn't want so he would go away and I could get on with my day.  Ordered carne asada tacos: 3/4 of the meat was greasy ground beef, the rest being small pieces of actual carne asada.  I planned to bring this up to the server, but expected I would have to get into another debate; which at this point would have made me lose my temper and make a scene.  So I just muddled through the meal and went on with my life.  I know the server's name, but won't put it here because I have the slightest bit of decorum that he lacks.  But his parents are from DALLAS, Texas.  I'd assume the high reviews of this place are from infatuated tourists who don't know decent Mexican food.",

No free chips and salads which I think is a must in all mexican restaurants. Had to order for $5.95. Tasted good though. Salsa was spicy.   Ordered the green enchilada and the short rib enchilada. Huge portions. Rice and beans were flavourful and not just filler. Good amount of meat inside the enchiladas as well. Also ordered a pitcher of red sangria. This was good as well. Good mix and balance of alcohol and mixed juices. Would come back.",

For starters the menu was completely different from what a lot of other Yelpers have posted; there was no seafood at all. I ordered carnitas tacos and it was mostly just fat. They pride themselves on the best margaritas, but they were just average.  On top of it all, super slow service and it wasn't even busy. Won't be back.",

I did have one inconvenience last time I was there. They were having a private party and I guess when this happens only the private party has access to the restrooms. They directed me across the way to Flamingo hotel. Not a far walk. But kinda odd.  Other than that all good! We will be back and I recommend going here. Try the BlackBerry matgaritas! Yum!",

I sat down at the bar since it was Sunday afternoon and the games were on, so I thought I'd be part of the fun group at the bar.  I don't know if it was in the wrong seat or what, but it seemed like I was in the one place that got skipped when it came to service.  After the two girls sitting next to me, which arrived after I did, got served, I was asked if I needed anything.  I requested a menu and some water.  I was pretty hungry and wanted to have a fun afternoon out on my own.  I ordered the chips and guacamole, which was very tasty.  I ordered two shots of tequila to help celebrate and they were nice.  They have a great tequila selection, so this was a plus!  When my lunch arrived, chicken enchiladas en mole, I was in heaven.  They were cooked very well and the flavor was excellent.  It just seemed to take a while to get waited on considering I was at the bar and it was mid afternoon.  I look forward to coming back for more tequila on my next visit but I might just sit down at a table instead.",

Plopped on a barstool in a fog, and braced myself for a typical Las Vegas Tourist interaction complete with imitation Mexican food, strained smiles, and forced banter from the server. I wasn't ready for the bartender, George.  George greeted me with a warm smile, friendly conversation, and menu recommendations based on our conversation. The food arrived promptly, with good presentation and excellent flavor. I enjoyed the meal, but the excellent service provided by George turned an expected jet lagged just-another-meal into a great experience that put a shine on the rest of my day. Go here. Sit at the bar. And experience something that is all too rare. Great food and drink served by George, someone who genuinely seems to care about your experience.",

The hostess and servers look very unhappy as if they do not want to work, particularly the female server that is supposed to be serving our table. So we walked in, the restaurant on 6/25/19 at approx 1 pm. The restaurant does not even have 10 patrons. We asked to sit at at table by the door (right at the entrance to the inside of the restaurant). The hostess tried to put us at the next table but we chose this one which only needed to have a plate and a glass removed from it and which is still a table being served by the same waitress that would have been serving the next table.  We sat there for half more than half and the unhappy server keeps walking by, ignoring us and making faces as she passes by. Obviously she was not happy to be working there. The hostess keeps passing us up and down ignoring us. I called out to her and she ignored us. Past half hour later, I got up to enquire from the hostess why is it that we are being ignored when we are sitting right next to the table we were supposed to sit at and requested to speak with a manager. The response we got was that the manager could not change anything. How sad!! We walked out!!  You are in the business of hospitality...... think again!!  I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Customers, if you want to feel appreciated (since you, the customer is paying for service) go to another restaurant!!  This place does not deserve you! What horrible service!!",

We thought about trying Hash House A Go Go, but the line to put in your name was 10 minutes long, so we checked out their menu and ended up here instead - and we were thrilled! I had the green scramble ($14, green chili pork, tomatillo sauce, spinach, jalapenos, guacamole and cheese), and it was REALLY good. So good, in fact, that I suggested going back the following morning to have it again!   All of our food was really good with the exception of one item - the chicken tinga skillet was SO salty my friend could only eat a little bit of it.   Our waitress was great, too - giving us thoughtful opinions of the menu and her recommendations - and even after her area was switched to a different part of the restaurant, she was on it and never left us hanging.   It was a great spot for a hearty, reasonably priced breakfast.",

    "text": "I don't often write reviews unless I'm extremely persuaded in favor or not in favor of a product/service provided by an establishment.   Today, I was highly unimpressed with this restaurant. My friend and I are staying at the Flamingo for a few nights and we wanted to try a new brunch spot this morning that offered bottomless mimosas. After reading through a few options of restaurants nearby, we saw the sign that they were offering $19.95 mimosas instead of their usual $25 option.   We were greeted by the hostesses, they were polite. They do not allow outside food/drink inside, which is understandable, but they should provide a trash can out front, instead of making potential customers walk across the path of people to toss trash. We requested a table located outside, a high top. The place was pretty empty outside, however, it took our server about 10 minutes to come greet us.  We ordered our mimosas which were brought out in a decent amount of time, maybe if we sat inside it wouldn't have taken quite as long. When our mimosas were delivered, we placed our food order, which came out pretty quickly afterwards. When our food arrived, our glasses were already empty. Our server came to check on us 15-20 minutes after that. Our bottomless mimosas had turned into one mimosa. By the time our server reached our table, we were already nearly finished with our meals, hence there was no need for more mimosas. We asked our server to remove the bottomless from our bill, seeings how we were only offered a refill once we were done eating. He mentioned that he was busy, and we understood that, it seemed like the servers were spread a little thin in the restaurant, which is sad if your restaurant lies right on the strip, you should always be prepared.   Not to mention since our server didn't check on us, we were not given any hot sauce, salt/pepper, ketchup, etc. In fact, we had to ask a hostess and she grabbed it from a nearby table needed bussing. I hadn't started my meal until about 5 minutes after it arrived, I wanted to add hot sauce.   Our server brings us our requested bill est. 10 min. after we asked to remove the items, and we found that he was trying to charge us for one mimosa each, which are $12!! We wanted bottomless for $19.95 not a single for over half that amount. That's ridiculous. As an industry worker myself, I would've removed the items completely, and only charged for the food items. I understand both sides of serving and dining. I'm not sure if the server wasn't allowed to make this decision or if he was just out to get his money. We ended up asking another hostess to speak to the manager. She came over in a fair amount of time and was more understanding of our situation, and ended up removing the items from the bill.  The managers response and the delicious food are the only reason why I gave them an extra star, because their customer service only deserved one. If you chose to give this restaurant a try, hopefully your overall dining experience is way better than ours.",

Someone comes around to offer to take your photo and later sell to you. We didn't take part but it could be a great souvenir if you're with a group of people.",

    "text": "Dined here on a gift card that was given, otherwise, I had never heard of it. It's on the Linq promenade. The place is huge! Tables and oversized half circle booths, and tons and tons of tvs. At least 3 from any focal point. All different channels, but only one with sound. It was difficult to tell which tv to watch at times. Overwhelming unless you are monitoring several sports games at once. There is certainly nothing romantic about the ambiance. Our server may have just had injections of Botox because not once did she ever crack even a half smile. It wasn't just us. I watched her interact with other tables. Her muscles just don't move. So again, she went through the motions. We ordered drinks but needed more time to look at the menu. The last time I checked, a server's queue that the customer is ready to order is when they put the menu down. We were still holding our menus when she asked again for our order. So annoying. We had an appetizer and shared an entree, which we stated when we ordered. We are used to at least being asked if we would like an extra plate or split plates. Nope, it came out as one plate. Period. Usually when we present a gift card, we are often asked if we are celebrating a special occasion, etc... she had zero interest in any conversation that did not involve her short stick idea of work. The food was good. But the overall experience did not invite us back. It really is for the tourists.",

I ordered the shrimp tacos, very dry and not tasty at all. The margaritas tasted awful, sewer water. This place should be your last resort.",

    "text": "I went to Chayo knowing that their target crowd is the partying drinker/pub crawler just like a majority of the other bars in the LINQ. Hence \"+ tequila bar\" in the name, the mechanical bull, the louder music, and a menu that is half food and half drinks. So I wasn't expecting a calm, peaceful meal that was a bargain. But I was very pleased with the service and the food. The food is traditional Mexican fare with some extra twists.  My buddy and I decided on Chayo after a Rebels game to eat and have some drinks. We were standing outside by the hostess stand and because the hostess was gone, our server was attentive and saw us. He came outside to greet us and took us inside to be seated immediately. He suggested the Golden Margarita and White Peach Margarita. We obliged and I had the Golden. A $14 margarita is jab to the wallet, but the Patron reposado packed an overhand right to the jaw. The tequila was definitely not hidden. After two margaritas each, we were feeling it.  As far as food, we started with chips & salsa and guacamole & pork rinds. The guacamole is great, creamy with the pomegranate and not too heavy with tomatoes or onions. The portion we received was at least double compared to the photos on Yelp. I would recommend the chips instead of the pork rinds with the guacamole as the pork rinds' saltiness overpowers the guacamole.  For entrees, I had the pork enchiladas and my buddy had the slow roasted beef short rib. My enchiladas were delicious. The cascabel chile sauce added great flavor and kick. I had a taste of the short rib and it was tender. The accompanying oaxaca cheese mashed potato was delicious.  Another trip will happen to drink some of the over 50 varieties of tequila and to try more of the food.",

The $18 burrito was huge. The $14 salads weren't big for their price, but they did come with generous portions of avocado, and they were appropriately sized for a 109-degree day, when the heat can kill one's appetite. The salsa was tasty. The small basket of not-free chips weren't noteworthy and thus arguably not worth $3 (the supposed price, although I see that the server forgot to add the charge to our bill).  Service was painfully slow. It's a cliche, but I began to wonder if they had to go pick the lettuce. I'm pretty sure the server simply forgot to check on our order. Ironically, I saw at least 2 staff members literally running through the restaurant and yet nothing seemed to be getting done. The staff seemed frazzled, and if I hadn't been so hungry, I might have been more understanding; it had been a HOT day and they must have been quite drained.  All in all, I doubt I'll be eating there again. And definitely not if I'm super hungry.",

My mom's \"tacos\" were really just a small piece of uncut salmon, with some beans on the plate and 3 soft tortillas just thrown on top. No tomatoes, no lettuce, no cheese. She was supposed to build her own tacos with a salmon steak and beans? My salmon steak was not terrible, but had no sides, and was dry as a bone, despite that it was swimming in some gross sauce. I told our very nice waiter that it was awful, and he insisted on bringing something else. I chose the tuna tostadas. Those were just some not very fresh tuna chunks that looked like cat food, on 3 very small round tortilla chips. Not tostadas... tortilla chips. It was worse than the salmon. When the waiter asked me how it was, I told him. And he said \"I'm sorry. To be honest, I wouldn't eat here either.\" The margarita was good, at least. But this was truly the worst food I've had in years. I still had to pay for the cat food chips, too. $15. Will never even look at this place again. So bad.",

I don't know. He trots off again and comes back to tell us that he has a pinot grigio. RED WINE. Oh ok, he trots off again, tells us that the has some (SMH). Ok, fine, whatever. We'll take it.

FINALLY, our waiter comes back and takes our order- we also ask about our drinks- oh, he forgot. 30 minutes later the food comes and it is flavorless and kind of gross. The Queso Fundido used the wrong kind of cheese (I think they used Mozzarella) and it was so thin, it was more like soup than a dip, and it was just cheese.. and milk I think. Not very tasty. My tacos were as basic as you can be, and were not that impressive and my friend's expensive salad was blah too.  Get it together.",

    "text": "This place obviously was made for tourists to go to, so I had that in mind going in.  But, it was still not the greatest.   I ordered the chorizo sopes (which is actually listed as an appetizer) and they were super bland. Someone else in their review said that it was authentic mexican food with a twist. I don't think that there was anything authentic about the food.  They looked authentic and had the title, but the taste was nowhere close.  Want Carne Asada?  You can't even find that here. I would've probably been better off just eating chips and salsa, which the waiter was nice enough to make sure that we had an abundance of and ended up bringing 5 baskets of chips and constantly refilling (there were 7 of us).   I actually went on the mechanical bull, and while that was fun, I primarily came for food, not a mechanical bull.  I enjoyed the atmosphere (a wall of sugar skulls, paintings, and another wall of elaborate crosses), but the music was loud and terrible.    The food was obnoxiously overpriced, hence why I went with an appetizer, but even that was still $16.   Waiter was nice.  He's probably what saved the review to be 2 stars.  I don't really plan on coming back here.  If I get pulled into it again, I'm probably going to eat somewhere else beforehand and just have their Sangria.",

We ordered the chips N salsa and guacamole.  The salsa was good, so we asked for another cup of it to finish off the massive pile of chips.  The waiter said \"Sure!\" but never brought it.  I asked what Margarita the waiter suggested and took him up on it.  He came back a few minutes later and said they were out of the ingredients.  The girls had Skinny Margaritas that came in what looked like \"toy\" glasses and had hardly any tequila.  Not very \"Vegas\"...  We ordered the nachos and some sample platter.  The nachos were a pile of chips with canned cheese dumped on it with a pile of beans on that.  It reminded me of a bowling alley.  The sample platter had no flavor.  We had enough at that point.  No offer for more drinks.... no, \"How is everything\"...  we paid our over-priced $120 bill and left.",

Wait staff was being trained so we have a couple hiccups, but nothing bad at all. They were fast and friendly. Menu is not your standard Mexican; think more trendy, out of the box. But we all ordered different taco (lobster, fish, pork) and everyone loved their choices. I thought it was excellent; the fish was fresh and NOT fishy, beans were the bomb!  And the salsa as perfect. Its not cheep - 3 fish tacos are $18-19 dollars. This is more of an upscale tequila bar that serves food. But the food is pretty good!!",

They are definitely proud of their mediocre food, judging by the over inflated prices and small portions....VERY small portions for the price.  Service was on point to come take our order but Jose our server didn't offer or suggested anything from the menu...HE JUST  TOOK OUR ORDER ,,, It was fairly busy, but not that busy! This place probably falls apart when it's really crowded, I imagine.  Jose's assistant (busser) messed up several times. I would not recommend this place...maybe for the drinks?!",

The first alcoholic drink came out and it was wrong so it got sent back.  Then 40 minutes, yes 40 minutes after ordering the food came out. Even after waiting that long, my food was completely cold. Had to send it back and 10 minutes or less my food came out hot. How hard was it to get hot food???

Tuesdays are BOGO taco nights and as I feel the place is pretty pricey for what you get any other night of the week, so this was the perfect night to try it out. I had the vegetarian tacos on corn tortillas (gluten free option) and guacamole. I've never had more flavorful and original tacos.   The pancho villa from the cocktail menu was just okay, I liked the spiciness, but it wasn't the best cocktail I had ever had. The margaritas were nothing to write home about either, but their selection of tequila is awesome.  There was a 7 year old child in the group, a picky eater, and they had a good kids menu for him too!   Servers here were pleasant, but not that helpful in trying to decided as the menu has so many options.",

I told the waiter it wasn't what I ordered so she proceeded to look at her book, I know what I ordered why try and argue with a customer.  My food arrives about 10 min later. She walks off. Literally, about 20 minutes go by my friends and I are thirsty and she is no where to be found. So I that to get up myself and go ask for water. Really!  As a club it's decent.

Our server seemed a little out of it and came to our table a few times without even taking our drink orders. He instead waited until we had decided on our food order before accepting our drink orders. I ordered a paloma. This is my beverage of choice anywhere that claims to be a tequila bar. Tequila is my favorite spirit and as such, i was really expecting to be wowed by this semi overpriced cocktails. I wasn't. The only reason I know it had tequila in it, was because they menu said that it did. In a tequila cocktail, you want to taste the tequila, not to judge the strength, but rather to enjoy the pairing of flavors between the agave, the bitter grapefruit and the tart lime. Unfortunately, i was basically drinking a glass of watered down, warm grapefruit juice. Yes, dear reader, it was served over ice, but it wasn't even cold. GROSS! My friend ordered a sangria that also seemed to suffer from a distinct dearth of alcohol.  Our food was slightly better, but the service did not improve. Considering the place was practically empty, this was not pleasing.  We had ordered chips and salsa to start, but it was brought out with our food. Considering that they charge for them, you'd think they'd bring them out when you ask. I ordered the chipotle chicken tostadas. Depending on where you are, you may be familiar with this dish as chalupas or some other colorful name. Essentially, they are corn tortillas, that have been fried crisp and topped with different things. This particular dish had a smear of black beans, the chipotle chicken, a drizzle of sour cream, a sprinkling of queso fresco and a random slice of radish as garnish. The chicken was smokey, but lacked spice and would benefit from some acid. It was a large portion (3 to an order), but the tortillas were not able to stand up to the toppings and ended up falling apart. I had to eat them with a fork.  My friend had the carnitas tacos. Her tortillas also seemed to fall apart. She was pretty happy with the meat.  The chips were pretty generic, but the salsa was not very good. It was pretty bland.",

    "text": "Only giving this two-stars because of the service.  Everyone from the bartenders to the food runners were very nice.    But... Oh my this place sucks.  Short Story: The food is terrible.   Longer Story: The music makes you think they fancy themselves a nightclub, at 2:00am, on a Saturday.  Even though it's a Tuesday.  And empty.  And 10:00pm.  The margaritas were 2-for-1 (cool) and had so much 'sour' in the mix that I had heartburn until the next morning (super not cool).  I've never had that happen, and I've had a lot of margaritas in my life.  The tacos were 1/2 off (cool) and tasted so terrible I couldn't finish one (not cool).  The meat was slow cooked in something that I suppose someone likes as it made it to the menu, after a major/costly restaurant build.  But the thought of having another one already makes me ill.  The Caesar salad that I ordered as a replacement was just as bad, which I don't know how it's possible.  Except too much anchovy in the dressing?  The dressing was even on the side and I couldn't eat half of the salad.  And they insist on making their chips \"fancy\" by putting WAY too much seasoned salt/whatever.  Oh, and the guacamole was garnished with pomegranate seeds.  Fancy.  Bottom line, no reason to go here.  Unless you have the need to ride a mechanical bull?  I really hope those nice bartenders get good jobs.  Can't imagine Chayo can employ them too much longer.",

I'm a local myself and frequently bring guests here all the time as this place is LEGIT!  The inside offers dining amidst a well designed Mexican themed interior.  There is also a mechanical bull that is available to guests late at night.  The outdoor patio is a favorite of mine.  Any of the tables offer an amazing view of the surrounding shops, restaurants, the High Roller, and of course a prime seat to people watch!  The food is great!  I've had everything from the chips and salsa (cuidado, es muy caliente!) to the fish tacos and everything in between. Todo es muy BUENO!  The service is ALWAYS great.  Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders are quick, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I even lost my debit card here one time and they found it and returned it to me asap!  I've came here many times and will continue to do so!  ARRRRRIBAAA!!!",

The hostess was clearly not pleased with our request and was very rude in telling us we would have to wait for the high top to be cleared. The place was not busy at all and the table was hardly dirty so it should have only taken someone 2 minutes to clean and reset it. We were standing between the table and bar when the hostess came up to us and told us to move closer to the bar because it was a health code violation to stand next to the table. Maybe that's True, I don't know but we literally only moved 6 inches away to appease her. In the meantime several bus boys and wait staff were circling around but I guess we were not important enough to clean a table that only had two empty glasses on it. After standing around more, nobody acknowledged us again so we left. Terrible, terrible customer service.",

If you're sitting upstairs, don't order soup because your order is filled downstairs and they often forget or just won't fill the order. After I received my entree, I realized I was missing my soup and mentioned it to our server. The response was, \"Oh, they usually forget to fill soup orders. Did you want me to bring it up?\" Ugh. Really? I ordered it, didn't I?   The food came to the table completely out of order. Hot mess! The birthday girl was soooo not happy. I felt awful. At this point, I would not recommend this place unless Beyonce dines here and makes a huge deal out of it. Sad. They have so much potential.",

Long story short we went for it and gave Chayo a go. Luckily for us we stumbled across  Cammi at the bar! She welcomed us with sooo much love and contributed greatly to the party we had started before we arrived. Once I have my mind set about the vibe of a place it's so hard to change. This girl turned it all around, turned a 3 star rating to a 5 star. Thank you Cammi for being amazing!!!!",

I started off with their \"Yucca Fries\" for $8, here I am expecting a plate full of \"Brazilian Potato\" fries like the waiter explained. Nope, it was a tin can with about 4 or 5 REGULAR steak fries (Lol)  Anyways, I ordered the 3 cheese Quesadillas with green sauce and handmade tortillas (I think), they were just decent. Also ordered a torta that did not compare to the taco trucks in East LA. (Sigh)   Overall, the food here is your typical Mexican dishes that honestly my mom would probably cook better. Although, I did hear the enchiladas were decent ($28).  I would probably not come back here, it just didn't wow me enough, and if I do I would probably hit the bar. Restaurant should really consider revising their menu and prices.  The staff is friendly but you could notice some are brand new and have never worked at a restaurant before. The bartenders are very friendly and make pretty good drinks.   Probably because I am Mexican I expected more out of this place, but I guess nothing beats Mom's cooking.  *If your in the mood for tacos, head down the strip to Tacos El Gordo and save yourself some money.*",

Pre-mixed, Splenda-soaked, fake-lime, tequila juice is not something I expect from a \"Mexican kitchen.\"   The queso fundido was horrendous. They threw a block of curdled cheese into a mini cast iron pot. What??? I mean, it tasted like cheese, so it wasn't nasty. But it was not \"queso fundido.\"   The rest of the food was palpable, but not close to memorable.   Sean, the manager, poorly handled our concerns. Also, don't stuff your face with cupcakes in your makeshift banquet area. It's not classy.   Eric, our runner, was amazing. If I had a $100 bill, I'd slip it in his pocket.

I don't want to be charged for bad food, and really bad food at that!! Service is terrible... slow... rude... a little condescending even. We started with the guacamole with pork rinds... the smallest portion of guacamole I have ever been served. We also had the lobster tacos as an appetizer..... bad.. dry... no flavor at all!!!! I was hesitant after that to even order an entree. (yes the waiter hadn't came to take or order for our entree, until we had completely finished our appetizers) We decided to share the steak fajitas..... big mistake... big... huge...  Don't do it... go somewhere else",

A few dishes were chicken enchiladas, hot wings, quesadilla, steak, burrito, nachos and hamburger. What I could say is no one finished their food or looked like they were too fond of it. I ordered the chicken enchiladas- they were plain. The chicken was tasteless and dry. My cousin ordered a burrito same. The nachos were nothing to rage about. I think the only good thing were the margaritas. Maybe next time we go here (if we ever do) we'll just have drinks and an appetizer. Also- it was fight weekend and the restaurant was empty. I think that should have been a sign. With so many other options at The LynQ, I wish we would have chosen a different place. :(",

Plus the food has been EXCELLENT!!",

Was somewhat bothered by the 'Would you like chips and salsa and guac?' by the waitress who quickly disappeared, as we were perusing the menu and gave a cursory 'yes' only to find out that this is an upcharge and a menu item.  Better if she'd said \"would you like an appetizer like guacamole?\" Or 'would you like complimentary chips while you're looking over the menu?'  It just felt scammy the way this was handled.  Aha 'gotcha!'  F$ck off with your sh*tty upsell tactics.",

Deidra then came to our table and told us we were too loud, and that we may be asked to leave if we did not quiet down. Seriously? In Vegas? During happy hour? We were shocked, so we apologized to our waitress, and she said what? She was shocked as much as we were! So if you want to go somewhere and enjoy yourselves for \"happy\" hour, this is not the place--well if Deidra is there!!!",

Guacamole prepared tableside ($9) is one of my faves.  I don't usually go for a full Mexican meal in Vegas &/or the heat, & also because there are so many other food options, since I eat plenty of Mexican @ home & on the road.    However, the ambiance was so lovely (Did I mention the people-watching?), & the Shrimp Ceviche Acapulco ($14) I saw @ a nearby table so enticing, that I ordered it.    The Golden Margarita ($14), topped with Grand Marnier, was the perfect accompaniment.    Who needs Dinner?",

No one answers at the number they have on their website. And when I finally tracked down a person, she promised to email the details but so far nothing. This is so unprofessional!  Even if she were extremely busy, there are 2 to 3 people listed as the \"event\" coordinators. I would assume that at least 1 person could reply to a basic question that probably has a formulated response. After all this, I wouldn't book my party here for anything!! Even if they ever got back to me, which I highly doubt, I wouldn't trust them to actually follow through with coordinating the party.  If anyone else was thinking of planning a private party here, DON'T BOTHER.  Go to Off the Strip, their website at least all the pricing details and their event space looks great!",

The restaurant itself is very large and elegant, but the food is just OK considering how expensive the food comes out to be. Bathrooms are upstairs just FYI, I had a bit of trouble locating it.   I had the Pork Enchiladas, which were good but was nothing special compared to other enchiladas I've had. Fair amount of meat, which was soft and juicy, but the portion was overall pretty small and not worth $18. They didn't have enough condiments baskets or something, because in the middle of our meal, our server came and asked for it back. My friends ordered off the breakfast menu (french toast and breakfast skillet) which was a bit cheaper, but the food was still pretty average. Service was friendly but pretty slow -- we had to wait 15 mins to get the check. I'd maybe consider coming back for happy hour, when drinks and tacos are cheaper! A cool thing about this place is you can bring your receipt back to ride the mechanical bull (but it was a rooster when I was there... is this because of Chinese New Year maybe??) when it's operating.",

The next day we went for brunch and ordered the churro french toast but our waiter informs us they are not currently making them.  That was kinda disappointing but luckily our waiter said he would ask the manager if they would prep some and was turned down. Then he said he would go ask a different manager (weird) and luckily that one agreed to do it. It was disappointing that we got a recommendation for one of their specialty dishes and when we went they didn't want to prepare it and the coffee was also pretty terrible. Tasted old and generic.

It came with some pickled veggies on top. The rice was nothing special either. A few other girls did not care for their food either. It just wasn't anything special. We also, ordered a pitcher of house margaritas. I thought it was super heavy on the sour mix, I just wasn't a fan at all.  Service was \"ok\". We had to ask for a re-fill on chips and water a few times. This restaurant is located in the LINQ row. It's very large and has a mechanical bull inside. Price wise, for Vegas it was average; chips/salsa was $5 and a pitcher of house margaritas was $30.",

    "text": "My friend and I came across Chayo on 11/17/2017 while at the Linq and decided to check it out.  The restaurant is located in the heart of the Linq walk way just across the street from Brooklyn Bowl. Its a pretty big place complete with three bars, an upstairs lounge and even a mechanical bull.   The menu is pretty standard Mexican fare: nachos, enchiladas, fajitas, tacos and the like. Nothing really stood out and I was surprised that they didn't offer free chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant in town. We started off with the chicken nachos which were just plain awful and I mean like Taco Bell status but at $17 a plate. Gas station liquid nacho cheese, dry shredded chicken, and the paltry squirts of sour cream had me begging our server for some house salsa in order to add some flavor to the dish.   We should have just asked for the check at this point but we were in the mood for making bad decisions and ordered even more food. Our next dish, the surf & turf taco platter proved that disappointment can come from both the land and sea. The Carne Asada was nothing but beef flavored fat paired with some dry Spanish rice and canned food refried beans. The shrimp was not fresh at all and didn't go well with any of the other fillings.   We topped off our night with the most traditional of Mexican desserts: bread pudding with ice cream. (why is this an option here but fried ice cream or churros are not??) This was the best dish we had but simply not worth returning for.   Overall I would never come back here. There are much better Mexican restaurants in town (none of which are on the Strip btw).",

For our entrees we ordered the short rib tacos and the sea bass that was on special. Both were outstanding. My fish was so moist and full of flavor. We packed up our food and ordered dessert. I'm a sucker for flan and people if you like this decadent dessert you have to try it here! I probably could have ordered 2 more and been more than happy. It took me back to my childhood when my mom used to make them. And the fresh fruit that comes with it only made it that much better. The atmosphere is there is great. Good music and the lighting in there is how I've never seen. Such a cool feel. They have walls full of sugar skulls then another one full of crosses. I felt right at home there. Our server Miranda was extremely nice and very helpful. She was able to answer all our questions, keep it light and fun for us and always there to help when we had questions. She was even able to show us pictures of some of the food before we ordered. Overall we would definitely go back. That kitchen knows what they are doing and the entire staff was very helpful. A good Valentines dinner down in the books. Thank you!",

The shrimp taco plate had 4 fairly large tacos, rice and black beans. The shrimp tacos had cabbage slaw and slices of avocados. The slaw was good. The avocado was delicious but the most important part, the shrimp, was not good. It tasted like it was frozen and heated up, it was chewy... not good. All I could to eat was the beans and the avocado. I'm so disappointed.  it was late and too tired to send it back, this cost me 25$ with tip. Ugh.

The guacamole is fresh and delish with tasteful chips that come with it. The other food (entrees) is okay, and a good option for dining. The prices are a bit on the \"you pay way more on the strip side\" of things, but that should be expected.   The service is pretty less-than-average. No one rushed to take our orders or check on us regularly. Meh.  Since I've had my fair share of amazing Mexican cuisine, there's not a ton to write home but not a lot of complaints either. I would stop in for a drink or appetizer but probably wouldn't make a trip to Chayo for anything specific or special, if that makes sense.",

As more people started to trickle in the waitress was becoming a bit overwhelmed. The manager came over and tried to assist with some of our requests. We both ordered the short rib omelette with extra crispy potatoes.  The omelette arrived and it was over cooked and dry. The short ribs while tender, where on the dry side as well. Sadly the potatoes were basically frozen potato piece that were deep fried extra crispy. They were tasty, but really not what we were expecting. The muffin was hard as a rock, but I tossed some butter and jam on it and ate it anyhow. We had to ask for many things throughout our meal as most was not on the table to begin with. We felt bad for the waitress, as she really needed some help from the manager to give her some slack.   With all this being said, we most likely will not return, as there are just too many great places to eat in Las Vegas that do it right consistently.",

    "text": "Hubster and I were in Vegas and decided to try this place for dinner. There was a 25 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. They take your phone number and we were able to walk around the Linq while we waited for a text. When our table was ready we were seated inside as requested. There's an outdoor patio if you wish to sit outside as well. It was 94 degrees that night so we preferred the inside.   Service was great. Our waiter was nice and attentive. He gave us recommendations and was constantly checking on us to make sure we had drinks and everything was going well. I noticed that he was constantly stopping by at all of his other tables as well.   Now for the food...IT WAS DELISH!!  It was really hot that evening, so we started with the shrimp ceviche. For an appetizer, it was a good sized portion. It had the perfect balance of lime and ingredients. We ordered the street corn as well and it was perfect. The corn was sweet and not too hard or too soft. I do wish that they would put the toppings all over the corn and not just on one side.   For the main course:  The hubster ordered the salmon tacos and I ordered the beef and shrimp tacos. We were definitely not expecting the big portions we received. Your plate arrives with 3x tortillas on the side so you can add the ingredients you want. I had meat and shrimp left over after i finished my 3x large tortillas. The rice and beans were the usual that you would get at any Mexican restaurant. There was nothing special there.   We should have ended our meal there, but I saw the pictures of the flan on yelp and i couldn't resist ordering it. I have never had flan with fresh berries on top. The flan was delicious and the berries were all fresh and sweet. It was the perfect way to end this great meal we had.   Overall, I am looking forward to going to Vegas with my friends and taking them to this place. The vibe is chill, the music is great, the staff was friendly and attentive, and most importantly the food was delicious! You won't regret trying this place.",

Our server was awesome and tried to split our bill even without us asking (we did have to make a few changes with what drink went where, but the thought was there).   Coming from SoCal, I wouldn't expect the food to be amazing (we are spoiled with some fantastic Mexican food), but for what it was, it was good. Prices are what you'd expect for the Strip.  Wouldn't say this is a \"must visit\", but if it was convenient again in the future I would definitely come back.",

I just happen to be taking my nieces for a ride on the High Roller at the Linq. After the ride we decided to get a bite to eat and the kids wanted Mexican.  The restaurant atmosphere was lively and exciting, We were greeted and seated almost immediately. Since we never eaten there before our food sever \"Patty\" gave us a great recommendation to try a little of everything, so we ordered a bunch of Tapas and different types of tacos. (Lobster, Steak, Fish) All was delicious. The service was outstanding !!! Our server Patty was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. She was the star of the day. It's not often that I'm able to find a server who makes dining out so pleasurable. Always smiled and seemed to go out of her way to insure that we were having a good time. Keep up the good work Patty. Thank you for making our dining experience a great time at your restaurant. We will be back for sure because of you :)",

    "text": "I went for dinner here with my friends from Texas and my hubby last night. My friend said they could not get us in until 7:30, ok, so we sat at the bar. Great looking restaurant, nicely done, great outdoor patio for people watching. I ordered a fabulous watermelon drink recommended by the nice bartender and it was so good! The bartender brought us all chips and great salsa while we waited which was cool.  Not very long after we got our cocktails, the hostess came over and and were seated in the very back booth facing a wall, ok, kind of unnecessary since it was less than half full in the place and there were plenty of tables but ok, I get it, waiter table rotation. Anyway, the waiter comes over, nice kid, with glasses, takes our drink order, and my girlfriend and I order the carafe of margaritas, the guys, regular drinks, beer, captain diet. So we look at the menu, and it's an ok menu, really not much to chose from, and I decide on the vegetarian enchiladas, my hubby gets the lobster fajitas, our friends, I don't recall...all in all, the food was good, not blow your mind great, just good. What was good were the margaritas! Seriously good! I'd go back just to hang outside and have a carafe of those!  One tiny thing.....back in the day, I was hired for the opening of Delmonico Steakhouse in The Venetian, and before we even opened, we had the best and most extensive 4 weeks of training, on food, wines, spirits, service etc. and it was invaluable, everything I learned stayed with me to this day and I notice, these new big expensively made Vegas restaurants these days are completely lacking in anything near proper staff training....and I really notice that when you go to a place that has just recently opened, is not seated to capacity, that you do not seat parties in the back facing walls, and when you deliver food, the most obvious thing before the food even comes out should be that the guests have utensils so they do not have to ask for them, it's just simple basics, I know I'm picky, but hey, thanks Emeril and I  Love ya for it!",

The DJ played a lot of popular Latin music & my friends and I danced the night away.

The cilantro cream soup with pine nuts was awesome, and the sweet corn enchiladas were AMAZING. Unfortunately I didn't get to finish them due to the sheer amount of food we had gotten with our appetizers, but I would have taken them home with me if I hadn't had plans later that evening. Overall, an awesome Mexican restaurant that I won't hesitate to go back to the next time I am in Vegas.",

You're basically paying $15 for juice. I suggest that you avoid this bullshit.   Service is seriously slow even though there were hardly any other people.  On the upside, you can request for chicharrones as a replacement for chips. Table side guac is ok, I don't think paying $15 for 1.5 avocados is worth it.   Be sure to anticipate the waiter to write on the bill what his anticipated should be.   You're better off hitting up Hash House.",

I will definitely be returning here during my next Vegas trip! Service, atmosphere, drinks all A+ !! And you can't beat the prices.",

Pros:  good margarita and good guacamole Cons:  The carne asada burrito had too much rice and the meat was over cooked and dry.  The short rib tacos were a disappointment.  It wasn't really \"tacos\".  It was a mound of meat with corn tortillas on the side, not fried or dipped in hot oil.  The rice was bland and the refried beans were not only bland but tasted like they were canned refried beans.  And our guacamole appetizer was brought out after the entrees.   I grew up along the border and have been eating Mexican food all my life and know good from bad.  I won't be going back.",

    "text": "To be honest me and my wife expected this place to be amazing. We live in Oahu and good tasting Mexican food is hard to come by. We came to Vegas Last year and this restaurant was packed so we were looking forward to trying it this time since we weren't able to last year.  The hostess who was polite and quick to seat us was great and to be honest that's where the good experience ended, except for the food! Which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. When the hostess with red hair sat us on the 2nd floor where Karaoke was being held we had high hopes that this was going to be fun.   I'll try to be be brief. The bartender was okay. He took a while to come to get our orders and bring our check as he watched The Last Man on Earth on the big screen TV. I don't remember his name but he was a bald headed gentleman with a beard.   The Karaoke was terrible as a second tier Karate Karaoke host tried to be funny, while being totally inappropriate at the same time. (He literally put his pelvis while on stage on a girls head as she sang, who could or could have not been his girlfriend.) Don't get me wrong I don't mind raunchy but j just didn't expect it from this place. Which looked like a really nice and decent restaurant from the front. It felt like this Karaoke didn't fit the atmosphere? Just bad entertainment and it didn't seem like anyone cared that worked there. We literally saw 3 different groups of people sit down after us and leave before us.  The manager who had his girlfriend with him sat right next to us who was also a semi bald heavyset man who bragged to a waitress that when he left Claim Jumpers he tried to bring his girlfriend who he insisted he was going to get hired eventually. He then tried to flirt with 2 waitresses while his girlfriend was there which don't ask me how she was with that dude. I believe her name was Rachel and I only know that because as he sat next to us he kept introducing her to everyone.  We still tipped the minimum of 15% and the main reason was the food. We definitely won't come back here again. If this is the vibe and atmosphere you are trying to have then it was no wonder the restaurant seemed emptier than when we came by last year. If this review is not the atmosphere you're looking for than we would suggest a better management team because whoever this manager is from Claim Jumpers may not be it.  Hope this review helps you to be better because your restaurant is beautiful!",

A friend of mine spilled my senorita (very fruity cocktail) and it spilled all over me :( He was able to get me a new drink on the house! Yay!  We were with a party of 6.. I ordered the lobster taco. was okay, kind of salty in my opinion. A friend of mine got the shrimp taco, was also a bit salty. I can't remember what everyone else ordered.  One cool thing is that they have a mechanical bull inside!  Would give 3 stars for the food but service is legit~!",

My friends and I saw at the bar and tried their three margaritas: original, mango, and strawberry. Mango and strawberry were gross! Just tequila laying on top of frozen fruit concoction. The originals were enjoyable. We ended up staying an hour and a half before leaving to go somewhere else because the Latin night was amateur. The DJ plays mainly reggaeton, which was okay for the little crowd they had, who obviously didn't know how to dance any other Latin Dances like salsa or bachata. Anyways, I give it three stars. This place could be fun, but just seems like a little senior frogs...and I'd rather just go to senior frogs.",

We were greeted when we first walked in and requested to sit outside but we were told that they were not serving outside? It was such a beautiful day I wouldn't see why. So we requested for a booth seeing that there was hardly anyone in the restaurant (after experiencing the horrible service I understood why). The hostess sat us at the booth all the way in the back by the kitchen when she could have sat us in the front.   Our waitress came by and didn't even introduce herself or even smiled. She gave us our menus and went to go get our water. When we ordered a couple of beers she asked for our ID's and couldn't even do simple math in her head to figure out our age. Then when she finally figured out we were old enough she thought our ID's were fake! LOL! She didn't even know anything about what kind of beers they had... Come on, you have to know what you're selling. That's like going to a car dealership and the salesman knowing nothing about cars! When I ordered my fish tacos and asked for lettuce instead of cabbage she said \"No. I don't think we even have lettuce in the kitchen. Our menu is different from other restaurants you can't substitute anything.\" Uhhhhh they have Caesar Salad on their menu so what do they make that with?   I wouldn't go back to this restaurant even if I was paid to. A restaurant is only as good as their workers. Listen to all the other reviews and go someplace where the workers actually know what they are serving!",

It's cute, if you're just looking for a drink. But the food is awful. Que horrible. The tortillas used in the tacos were some of the most bland, stiff tortillas I've ever had. The meats - we had both the ribeye and carnitas - were not good either. The ribeye was tough and had this weird sauce rubbed on it. The carnitas didn't have much flavor. The best part of our meal was the mango and watercress salad.  We sat at the bar and one of our friends who was there earlier and ordered before me didn't even get her food. When she asked the server about it, she acted as if the long wait was not a big deal and simply said \"the kitchen must be really backed up right now.\" Seriously?!? WTF. The place, by the way, was not packed at all. It was Sunday, probably around 7:30 pm.  Do not waste your calories here.",

After a nice host outside said it was cool to bring in my extra alcohol we were seated.   I have to say the margarita, for being at a Mexican restaurant, was a major fail. It was just bad. Even though the waiter was really nice about taking it back and replacing it with a different margarita. The second margarita was bad too. So just avoid margaritas.  But everything else was amazing.  You know how you can eat something and taste love? Well the carnitas tacos I had tasted like love. Just ooey gooey flavorful love. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.. #idied So. Freaking. Good. I also had rice. Green rice. That kinda looked like throw up. But if you close your eyes and open your mouth you'll be taken on a journey. A journey into epic rice land full of love and yumminess.  Just yeah... Go there.",

Our experience was absolutely horrible. The restaurant wasn't as packed as we anticipated (for being St. Patty's day). When we sat, we waited a bit to be served. We placed our drinks order. We waited like 20 min for them to be delivered. We finally placed our food order and it took forever to arrive as well. We ordered chicken, fried fish, and lobster tacos to start and they were all pretty bland and simple. Definitely not worth the price. When we got our tacos, we ordered some hot sauce to make them a little tasty. They took so long to bring the hot sauce that we finished every single one of our tacos!! When someone finally brought the hot sauce, they just dropped it off quickly and they even forgot to take the wrapper off! So WE had to do that. Thanks! Great service!   We constantly had empty plates on our table. The busser would take so long to clear our table that we had glasses of beer stacked on top of each other.   Every time that we would order a beer, it would literally take 20 min to get it. So be aware of this!   When we finished eating the tacos (starters) the busser was already setting the table for dessert when we didn't even order our main course. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas as a main course and they were extremely greasy. Wish we had just gone straight to dessert instead.   It really was a horrible service even though 70% of the tables in the restaurant were empty. I wouldn't go back to this place at all!",

Not great by any means. I know being a hostess can be very annoying but you should not portray that you are annoyed to your guests. The welcome was not friendly.

So making our way out of The Quad toward The Linq, we saw this place and since we were all starving (& trying to recover from the night before) we decided to try it out.  We were sat right away and greeted with ice waters (which was amazing given it was 109 that day) and chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. The salsa had a good kick and the chips had a spicy seasoning and a nice crunch.  We ordered their guac and pork rinds to start with. The portion of guac for the price was just sad. Like a baby scoop of ice cream. Totally a bummer because it was decent! Had a nice little tang to it from the pomegranate seeds and paired with the pork rinds made it very unique. The boys ordered fish and carnitas tacos. The carnitas were bland and dry. The fish tacos, as per the Hubs, \"were solid.\"  I had the Avocado Corn Chopped Salad which was full of flavor and texture. It had hearts of palm and cactus- two of my favorite Latin food flares. I ordered it with chicken, but it would've been better with a different meat option. Like most of the restaurants in Vegas this place was way overpriced,  especially for lunch. Would I come back? Yes, but only for tequila and the mechanical bull, in that order.  Giddy up!",

We wanted to have a great view of the ferris wheel and chose Chayo because they have a balcony area and considering the only other bar open that night with a balcony was Yardhouse, which we've been to a dozen times in Town Square.  I must say the look and atmosphere of Chayo is really wonderful. It's whimsical and inviting from the outside, and once you enter there is a mechanical bull in the center of the restaurant. We ended up at the bar to wait for seating on the balcony. There was a bartender there who was phenomenal. I didn't catch his name but he was older. He was incredibly nice and informative. The hostesses, server, and even our busser were all wonderful, as well. The food being served looked good and smelled even better while we waited, so I was excited to try it!  UNFORTUNATELY.  This was an incredibly MUNDANE mexican food experience. The food was so bland. It was definitely edible, don't get me wrong, but I payed $18 for really blah chicken enchiladas. The guy sitting next to me at the bar had ordered them and they looked wonderful so thats why I chose them.   So. Much. Regret. I also got the $8 INCREDIBLY TINY tortilla soup which was basically tomato water. It honestly looks like it comes in a shot glass. The chips they served tasted great and the salsa was ok, nothing special. My boyfriend even said we should have just stuck to our local Super Burrito! Ugh. The only thing making up for the food was the view.   I wanted to give this place a try because for some bizarre reason I thought it'd be different than a few other mexican strip restaurants, but no, I was so, so wrong. The price isn't really the issue, I ALWAYS expect to pay absurd amounts for food/drink when I come to the strip.   I really hope this place improves their menu. The pleasant staff and beautiful look of the restaurant should be reason to improve the quality of your food.",

We started off with chips and salsa and guac. I really enjoyed all of that. I also ordered some red sangria and my boyfriend ordered a margarita. While my sangria was good, the margarita was honestly lacking. It tasted like there was barely any tequila in it at all, which is disappointing for the cost of the drink.   For my meal, I'm not sure if I just ordered the wrong thing, or what happened. I ordered the blackened salmon tacos. When it arrived, it was just a piece of fish (not blackened) next to some tortillas, beans, and rice. They forgot to put the slaw and salsa on my plate, though I'll admit, it didn't improve the quality of the meal when they brought it over. I was honestly just disappointed in my tacos, especially for the price. My boyfriend and other people at the table ordered some fajitas, and I think those went over really well and were very flavorful.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is western and trendy. The service was great and they definitely were accommodating to our table for the birthday festivities.",

I can only imagine the kitchen!  Waitress never brought us plates or napkins. After ordering and receiving our appetizers, (in which the food runner put his fingers in) it took almost 45 min for the dinner to come. Rude staff, rude manager, don't waste your time coming here.

We're in Vegas for Super Bowl weekend. Had an awesome time Saturday night, woke up on Sunday without a hangover (yay!) and then went to Linq to watch the big game.    We passed the Chayo cart and asked for a michelada. The guy told us we needed to go inside to the bar and they would make it for us. We went in and it wasn't that busy. Went up to the bar and ordered from the bartender. She SIGHED and looked very irritated that we ordered 2 micheladas. I asked her NICELY if there was a problem with us ordering that.  She said no and walked away.   THEN, she came back and said (AND I QUOTE) \"Sorry for the sigh. People have been ordering those all day and I'm sick of making them. I want to make something else. Maybe I should make them taste awful that way I don't have to make them anymore.\" What the Hell?!?!?!  I told her that the fact that she said that made us not want to order from her at all. She walked away muttering that she just \"won't make jokes all day\".  She was NOT joking.   We didn't say anything to the management, but I'm still tripping out that she said that shit.   We will NOT go back there.  Hopefully management will read this review and think twice about who they put at their bar. This girl's attitude was absolutely unacceptable and if I was the manager she would be fired.  Update: management reached out shortly after this review was posted. They offered for us to come back and have a round of drinks on them. Unfortunately, we were heading back to Cali that day. Will let you know if they keep their word when we go back in April. :)",

    "text": "I'd give this place a 3.5star rating for food.   Appetizers- The tortilla soup was amazing, but had no chicken or cheese, which all other tortilla soups I've had all contained. So this one just seemed like it was missing something, but it did taste amazing. They don't provide free chips and salsa- they're $3. The chips are seasoned, but neither the chips nor salsa are very flavorful.   Entrees- I had the beef short rib and my gf had the fish tacos. My dish was okay. The short rib was super tender and the plating looked amazing, but lacked flavor in the meat and in the mashed potatoes. My gf's tacos were good, but had too much sauce that tasted like mayonnaise.  Dessert- I got the tres leche, and again, it was only okay. I'm used to having tres leche very moist and sweet, but this one was dry and not very sweet. Honestly, the food isn't bad, but it's just not something I'll rave about.  Reason to go: The staff was SUPER friendly and nice. The location is perfect, located in the new Linq project in the center of the Las Vegas strip. They have outside seating, so you can enjoy the fresh air and people watch while you dine. My gf and her friend loved The Senorita margarita (made with moscato d'Asti)",

We finally got recognized and got our drink orders.    The food was not great at all.  My Torta roll was very hard and the thing with the most flavor on my food was the red onion.   Who even offers fries as a side!?  But the capper was being over charged on my bank statement for a $40 tip on a $47 dollar check.   I guess their reading ability is on par with their seasoning skills.    You'd be happier going to Chipolte!",

It came with rice and frijoles de la olla. (Which is pinto beans with a tad bit of chorizo)  quite excellent,  reminded me of childhood.  Recommend the carnitas taco plate.  Absolutely wonderful Bloody Mary mix, which is house made and we were offered a taste before we picked regular or spicy. I ordered spicy and it was just enough kick of horse radish.  Yummy!!! My boyfriend ordered regular, drank half of it and added a corona,  the best bloody beer in Nevada.",

Not impressed to say the least.  For our lunch we had the chicken enchiladas and two taco dinners, carne asada, which neither looked nor tasted like carne asada, and the carnitas tacos, which were a little better, but not by much.  The rice and beans that came with them had no flavor at all.  I know Mexican food and this was not Mexican food, only an attempt at Mexican food.  For how expensive it was, I was expecting a lot more than what I received.  I wouldn't have minded the cost if the food was actually good.   The server was good though.

While I've never really understood the practice of not offering happy hour prices throughout the whole restaurant, I was truly perplexed to find out that what looked like the bar area (because it had a HUGE bar in it) was actually NOT the bar. The happy hour section was a very cramped, dark little side area in the restaurant. We opted to dine in the high top area, with the bar, where we could look out at the promenade. I ordered a tortilla soup, and my partner ordered a burrito.   Our server, Serenity, was professional and kind, however, the overall dining experience was lackluster. The restaurant doesn't offer complimentary chips & salsa. The $18 burrito was basic, disappointing and dry. The tortilla soup was extra salty and too thick.   When the bill arrived, I noticed that the charge for the tortilla soup was $9.95 instead of $8.95 as it appeared on the menu. When I asked the server about the price discrepancy, she indicated that they had recently raised their prices, and it wasn't reflected on the menu. We asked for the manager, and she agreed to remove the additional dollar. When we pointed out that they should update the menu to reflect current pricing so diners aren't surprised at the bill, she agreed.",

It made for a difficult dining experience.  Our food was wonderful and i was very pleased with my corn enchilada.   The drink was ok.  The service was great.  He was on top of it the whole time.

All types, tacos taco bell to Javier's. I came here hungry and ordered the nachos. When it arrived the cheese was shredded cheese that had not even been melted! just thrown on! For a restaurant in a hotel that says melted 3 cheese I was pretty shocked. I asked him to melt the cheese and when they brought it back they had brought back new nachos with nacho cheese sauce?!??? All in all it took 1 hour and I just wanted my cheese to be melted so I could enjoy my nachos.  The staff was so rude and inconsiderate. He told me to wait because the kitchen was upstairs and he would have to run up there and he had stuff to do down here. Like are you serious.",

    "text": "0 stars for the racist trash General manager at this place. My group of Mexican-American, Mexican, Puerto Rican American, and African Americans came into the restaurant and it being Vegas of course we were all in a great mood having a wonderful time and wanted to get some food so we chose this place due to the wonderful live mariachi music we heard playing. Shortly after being seated my group was approached by the general manager who came in extremely hostile saying that we were cursing and he had to move a family with a child.  He approached us in such a  offensive way that it was as if he was treating us as though we were small children. It was ridiculous because we weren't cursing any more than anyone else and I think it was our presence that offended the family more than anything else. That became abundantly clear when the general manager told us to stop cursing and ended it with \"no mas\". This was extremely offensive. This white man who spoke no Spanish what so ever would try to add an offensive jab at the end of what was already an uncomfortable exchange. As soon as he left the table all of us were in disbelief of what had just happened so we called him back over to our table to explain why that was inappropriate. We calmly explained our feelings and he had a glazed over look as if he didn't care one bit. And when he tried to offer an extremely insincere apology he was called on it. Us calling him out on his behavior is something he was probably not use to because it prompted him to ask us to leave. He was embarrassed because he made a racist remark and we were the type of people to let it slide. Mexican people should not have to come to a Mexican restaurant and get mistreated by a low class white guy.",

    "text": "Even though it's a tequila bar and restaurant, they have a full service bar and is a great place to watch sports. There were lots of large TV's playing every sport so we were able to follow all of our bets.  We had the appetizer platter, enchiladas, shrimp diablo, street corn, tres leches and churros.  Everything on the appetizer platter was great, but the taquitos were the stars of the plate. The were perfectly crispy with a great guacamole and tasty chicken filling, making us all bargain for who got to eat the last one.  The chicken wings were similar to buffalo wings but made with chipotle instead of standard hot sauce. The quesadilla had poblano peppers inside, which was a really nice touch.  We couldn't decide on sweet corn or short ribs for the enchiladas so our great server Chad suggested we add short ribs to the corn enchiladas.  When they came out, everyone had to try it.  The short rib was great because it balanced out the sweetness of the corn, and it all got even better when we added the house salsa on top.  Chad got some extra tip for that suggestion.  The shrimp diablo were cooked perfectly, you could tell they were fresh and made to order. They weren't overdone and rubbery like most places.  As for the level of heat? It was perfect. It was just the right level of spice where it was hot without changing the taste of the food (it was hot, but not just for the sake of being hot). The rice underneath was extremely flavorful and paired well with the food everyone else had ordered.  If you love street corn, do yourself a favor and get it off the cob, it's just a bowl of delicious elote with no messing around (way easier to share too).  The desserts were really good and would definitely get them again.  The tres leches was so good we ordered another.   All in all, we had a great meal and will be going back next time we are in town!",

Once seated, signalled by throwing our menus on a table, we no longer had to endure bad attitude girl and things improved dramatically,  thanks to our server Benjamin.  He alone was responsible for turning a negative experience into a positive one, along with the food. Benjamin was cordial, well-informed, knowledgeable and professional.  We never waited for anything once he arrived.  The Guacamole is the best I've had in Las Vegas, by the way, suggested by Benjamin. Caesar salads were great, Sangria was delicious and all appetizers were wonderful.  A lot of your neighboring tenants could learn a thing or two about customer service from Benjamin.  As locals, we appreciate the extra effort Benjamin took to turn our experience around, all without knowing about the crappy hostess. Thanks Chayo for the excellent food and thanks Benjamin for being a real professional!",

The only down side to the happy hour is you have to sit on the upper deck, but hey not that big of a deal.   The staff up here is absolutely amazing. They're all very attentive and caring. They ask repeatedly if your good, keep an eye on your drinks and make good conversation.   The food was great. We had the fries, wings and street corn. All of these met our expectations and more. I had been craving a good street corn and this one was perfect. On another trip to Vegas I would come back here.",

Our experience went a little something like this :  12:01pm = Check in with the hostess who was brand new. She stated that someone else would be helping us as she was unsure what to do. Love the location as it is in the alleyway between the Flamingo and Linq Casino - close to shops and all!  12:10pm = Still waiting at the host stand for our party of 5 to be seated.  12:13pm = Because we were drawn to their large, shaded patio with white strung lights, we requested to sit outside. We were given two tables pushed together in the back, which was nice.  12:25pm = Greeted by our server. I have to admit, he was insanely busy and appeared to have the entire patio in his section. Order drinks, decide on a pitcher of margaritas for the table.  12:37pm = Our pitcher arrives - so we eagerly order our meals so we don't have to wait even longer. The hubs and I chose to split the appetizer sampler (quesadilla, wings, queso, and more!) while others decided on nachos and a side salad.  1:10pm = Our food arrives, which we devour as by this time, it's been well over an hour since we arrived. Food was decent, nothing mind blowing, but decent. We request more water, enjoy the patio and conversation.  1:25pm = Request check, pay and go about our way.  After all was said and done, the atmosphere and patio were great, but the service was just plain awful. The food was nothing special and I wouldn't go out of my way to return.  #sorrynotsorry",

My 19-year old daughter & her friend went to Chayo for brunch while our family was visiting Vegas last week.  They were treated very poorly by their server - a mid-30's guy with a ponytail or bun.  They were seated at a tiny table back in a corner, largely ignored, then were ridiculed when they placed their order for French toast and chocolate milk.  Apparently Chayo doesn't serve chocolate milk - perfectly fine, but no need to be a jerk about it. After receiving their food, they were never checked on again, then practically had their check thrown at them.  I might've written this off to a middle-aged guy with some insecurity  issues, but later when we are at the pool, a couple who'd witnessed the whole thing that morning came up to us and told us how appalled they were about how the girls were treated.  I understand they're a Mexican restaurant at night & have a nice drink option.  Hopefully those provide a better experience, but they seriously need to take a look at some of their staff.",

To then which these idiots got loud and rude and COMPLETELY ruined my Fajitas that now had a after taste of deplorable! One of these bigots had the nerve to say that their server belongs in the back mopping floors.... which to their logic wouldn't make sense because if he was too disabled to serve food then he is probably too disabled to mop floors?

The margaritas here were fantastic, and the appetizers were satisfying as well (try the Chipotle Wings if you're into spicy food). Additionally, the atmosphere was fun and laid back - it's perfect when you've been out on the strip for a few hours and are looking to rest and refresh.

The hostess was friendly and explained to us that there would be about a 30-45 minute wait so she said she would text us when the table was ready. We decided to walk around and get some Starbucks to pass the time. After no notification, we walked back where the hostess said she had called us twice. She was really sweet and let us sit in a booth upon request. Half of the restaurant was empty so we didn't understand why there was a wait but again, maybe it had something to do with them being a short staffed?  Our waiter came and brought us some waters. We ordered some drinks and after receiving them we didn't see him for awhile. We saw two women from another table bring their receipts to talk to him. I'm assuming some drama went down because it wasn't until another 20 minutes went by that another waiter came and told us he would be taking over. Our food came out 20 minutes later and it was okay. I ordered the Sweet Corn Enchilada.   The bathroom is upstairs and there is a bathroom attendant. She was very kind, however this made me feel incredibly uncomfortable because I was the only one in there and I didn't have any cash with me to tip. I just feel uncomfortable any time there is a bathroom attendant anywhere honestly.  Overall, the staff was nice but the food and service were eh. I wouldn't come back here and pay $16 for their enchilada again.",

She was helpful and welcoming!  She made our dining experience super enjoyable with her professionalism and warmth.  I wish more waiters and waitresses had her behavior!  We ordered... Guacamole - a bit bland (would be better with some lime juice) Steak Taco - Delicious! Corn Enchilada - My husband loved it! Red Sangria - Delicious! Corona   Aside from girls dressed in bikinis riding bulls and the guy on his joystick jerking them for his and other men's sexual pleasure, the rest of the restaurant was pretty cool.  I loved the day of the dead decor on the walls, the crosses and chandeliers with bottle bulbs.",

The chicken nachos are great and the tacos, deconstructed, provides a nice way to build your own.  Margaritas are exceptionable and I had an awesome margarita with a hint of Habanero pepper and it added to the whole Margarita \"experience\" thing.  It went super well with the chicken nachos.  The server was cheerful, friendly, and made recommendations. The patio is a wonderful place to sit to enjoy the activity along the Linq.  There are heaters outside to combat the chill air, tonight was unseasonably warm and the heaters not needed.  This is a great place to take friends and make a good memory of the Strip.",

We tried several places within Linq Promenade this year and last year, but the food and service were definitely up to par at this restaurant. We shared both a chicken burrito and chorizo nachos. The burrito was so filling and tasty. I'm usually not a burrito person but everything in this burrito fit perfectly. The nachos were a great portion size for the price but the chorizo was a little overcooked and I wish they put more on it. I asked for extra queso which definitely did the trick. My best friend didn't really care for the nachos but she had braces and it was her first time trying chorizo. Perhaps we'd have to try it again with chicken. Our waitress was very attentive and super nice. She was very accommodating and constantly checked on us to make sure we were okay. I would definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "I have been to Chayo numerous times and the service has NEVER been good, but the food has been. So I decided to take some friends that were visiting from out of town on Monday nite and I have never been so disappointed. We were seated by the hostess and it took our server quite a while to even approach us, when he did- we ordered margaritas.... the margaritas were all mix! I get it, it is happy hour (2 for 1), but there was NO tequila! We ordered the Para La Mesa for our table to share, the amount of food would have been perfect, but the steak was completely chewy, fatty and was VERY salty, the chicken was even saltier to the point that we could not even eat it! The meal also came with street corn, which was seasoned but the crema was served on the side, so the whole street corn experience was ruined! The meal was served to us by a food runner and our server NEVER came to check on us throughout the meal, so there was no point to say that the food was terrible! When he came towards the end as he could tell we were no longer interested in the food, he asked how it was and I mentioned the complaints and he couldn't have cared any less and he brought the bill with no concern. He sure was quick to come collect the payment.  Overall I have to say that I will NEVER go to Chayo again and I am super disappointed to say that as they have a great location and atmosphere, but I don't think that I have ever had such bad service and bad food!",

We had to ask 4 times for a Diet Coke.   The biggest disappointment was the bar service. For a place that advertises themselves as a tequila bar, and has an extensive tequila menu, it was surprising they didn't have easy access to the high end tequila we ordered. Either the bartender was too busy, or didn't know what we were asking for.  It took about 30 minutes to get the tequila we ordered, even then we had to ask a couple of times.",

    "text": "We had a wonderful meal here tonight! It was easy to make a reservation in advance and when we arrived we were seated right away at a great booth that was both quiet and away from the bar, which we requested. Our servers (one was overseeing, one was shadowing) were both attentive and wonderful. The music was fantastic and I found myself singing along to almost everything! The servers and the kitchen were all respectful of my cilantro allergy-- our server even went as far as taking a plate of fajita fixings away from me when she saw that the kitchen had put pico on it (I was just going to eat from the other side of the plate since it's not hard severe) and making the kitchen replace it. And the best part was obviously the food! I had the queso to start, which was delicious. It had real melted cheese in it, which made it stringy and comforting, but it wasn't too spicy and had a great flavor. And my fajitas (which had to be substituted with chicken from another dish because their fajita chicken is marinated in cilantro-- something our server knew off of the top of her head when I ordered, which really impressed me because that never would have even crossed my mind) were great! They came with half an ear of loaded corn, which was so good that my husband ordered another side of it,  some to eat there and some to take home with us. I'm not sure what kind of orange sauce they put on it (chipotle mayo, perhaps?) but it was to die for! The only thing that didn't impress me was their dessert menu (brownie sundae, tres leches, flan, or bread pudding), but that was fine with me because dinner didn't leave much room for anything sweet! I would definitely come back!",

Crowd: Better dressed tourists, and disproportionately appreciative Hispanics.  Menu: Americanized Mexican  Service: Friendly and attentive, but was presented a dirty spoon and a drink was delayed.  Food Ordered: Ceviche shrimp, sopas, diablo shrimp, and a mojito.  Food Quality: The ceviche tasted wonderful and made me forget that there was no fish.  The sopas were delicate, delicious, and lasted mere seconds on my plate.  The diablo shrimp huge in portion and the spiciest thing I have tasted in weeks.  Sadly, the flavor was not quite up to the heat.  Finally, the mojito was refreshing, but a little light on the alcohol.      Value: Not cheap, but a fair price for a great meal.  If you want a great Mexican restaurant that is unappreciated, look no further.",

Hostess asked us if inside was ok as the patio was full and then proceeded to take us to the very back of the restaurant.  I asked if we could sit at an empty table just inside but with a nice outside view.  Our server greeted us right away and told us about Happy Hour and returned with two cold beers and took our order for Gorditas and Carnitas.  Both arrived promptly and were delicious.  Our table was the perfect spot to watch the Memorial Day crowds pass by and our server looked after us with efficient enthusiasm.  We had such a good experience that we decided to visit again two days later for Happy Hour and bottomless chip and salsa.  The second visit was the exact opposite of the first.  The hostess seated us in almost the exact spot where we proceeded to wait and wait for our server.  Waiters/waitresses, busboys and even the manager buzzed around us for almost fifteen minutes chatting and socializing amongst themselves before one waitress asked if we had been served.  She took our order for beer and chips and salsa which arrived shortly and then disappeared.  It was obvious that she took pity on us at the start and served us although her  section was clearly in the back of the restaurant. Service was terrible and it would have been easy to walk out without paying. No one would have noticed.  So for food, alcohol and atmosphere we would recommend a visit although service might be hit and miss.",

    "text": "We like the link and decided to give Chayo a try, expecting a mexican restaurant geared towards white middle america tourist pallets with strip prices. Considering my expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.  The hostess setup is a little weird. I asked the girl at the podium outside for a table inside and she told us to go see the hostess inside the doors. It just seems a bit redundant to have two spots. I guess she was the patio hostess. The interior is nice, seating was comfortable and service was quick, friendly and informed. Chips and salsa are not complimentary. The salsa was ok but I did not like the seasoning on the chips. It was similar to seasoned salt, not for me. The guacamole was overpriced and under flavored at, I think $9 but it had pomegranate seeds which was a nice touch and came with pork rinds, which was also good. The caesar salad had good dressing and a decent portion. Mahi Mahi tacos were on the dry side. The waiter asked how my tacos were and when I mentioned that they were a little dry, he comped them. Very nice The lobster tacos were good  and the short rib was very tender with enough fat left on to have a proper mouth feel but not so much to actually seem fatty and actually had more spice  heat than I expected and was served with a delish potato/oaxan cheese puree.  I was impressed and would return for the short rib.",

Mexican food has gotten pretty bland at most chains, but it was spicy hot in a great way, bold and brave, not gringo at all. Definitely worth your while, come sit in Christine's section and she'll make sure you're taken care of!",

We were sat and waters were brought, our drink order was taken and they came about 15 minutes later...much too long for the place being empty. A few of our party arrived about 15 minutes after our drinks arrived ($14 for a tiny little mixed drink...ridiculous) and our server had still not gotten back to take our food order or the new arrivals drink order.  We ordered a few appetizers, thank goodness, because our food did not come for another 30 minutes. Our server was kind of a jerk and did not come and check on us. The manager came over one time but all she did was take more drink orders, did not apologize for the long wait or the horrible service. We ordered chips and salsa but the salsa was way too spicy even for me to eat and I love spicy food. The next time we saw the server we had to ask for our bill, we paid with a couple of cards and the rest cash. The server NEVER brought us our change back, by that time we were so fed up we just wanted to leave. I give this place 2 stars only because the ambiance and decor was very nice. The food was not even good the enchiladas were more like 4 mini tacos with sauce on them (it was $18 by the way)....my friends couldn't even eat their salads. Would never recommend this place.",

It is pricey but you should know that eating on the strip. Split the meat dish @ $50 (forgot the name) but it was excellent. Pork, steak and chorizo with vegetables and sides. Chips, salsa and Guac was all above average as was my drink. Sugar cube with orange bitters and tequila, small drink but tasty. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars at this point was the fact that we had servers bring us the wrong thing on 4 or 5 occasions. I believe they still had yet to learn the tables and as the place just opened I wasnt that bothered by it. If they have that little problem fixed the next time I am in (which I will be) Im expecting a 5 star experience.",

During our meal a runner dropped an entire tray of food, leaving the patron across from us with a small cut on his leg. We ordered the chayo margaritas which came to us without the pictured blood orange garnish. The margarita was also yellow when it was supposed to be orange or red, which leads me to believe it was not what I ordered. We ate our appetizers over our menus because no time was taken to clear them after we ordered.. When our water glasses were finally refilled the waitress palmed the top of all of our glasses and did not excuse her reach. Once the food arrived, Nobody checked to see how it was nor were we asked if we needed anything additional. The waitress at one point jumped over the railing to the walkway out side the patio to hug a passing friend and spent several minutes chatting. We were not asked if we wanted another drink ... A desert .. Etc.. The check was just dropped on the table with a less than sincere thank you.. And was removed very quickly once I completed signing it.. This time no thank you. -- the tacos were half off, thank god because I could not imaging paying the normal price of $18 for such a small portion. I left mad.",

    "text": "Okay, so maybe I've watched too many episodes of Bar Rescue and Restaurant Impossible. I can no longer enter a dining/drinking establishment without wondering what John Taffer or Robert Irvine might say about it. Unlike everywhere else in the world, in Las Vegas, it seems like if an establishment has enough foot traffic to keep the books above water, it doesn't really matter what they do, right or wrong. And in a location like The Linq, I would assume that Chayo has enough foot traffic from hapless unknowing tourists that they don't have to worry about doing everything (or anything) right, at least for a little while.  My friends and I, all locals, decided to brave the strip for a rare night on the town. The Linq seemed like a fun spot to eat and drink so we chose Chayo for dinner. No complaints about the service; it was fast, efficient and friendly (the fact that the waitress acted as if she'd never been asked to split a check notwithstanding). But I immediately found myself confused about the overall theme. Loved the colorful Mexican folk art masks that adorned the walls and the warm, dim lighting that set the stage for a chill dinner among friends. The music, on the other hand, set a different tone. Iggy Azalea and other dance pop artists boomed from the speakers, making it difficult to conversate without a lot of \"Huh?\" and \"I'm sorry, what?\" Maybe some people, particularly the partying, strip going crowd, are into that, so I can't judge them too harshly, but the selection seemed in stark contrast to the traditional Latin decor. Tapas plus Iggy...confusion. Tapas plus fun, flirty Latin tunes...awesome.   Further confusing factors? A mechanical bull somewhat centered on the dining floor. Sure it was fun to watch some crazy folks get tossed unapologetically from the wild, fake bull, but it's not exactly what I'd call dining entertainment. On a trip to the bathroom, an incredibly drunk girl by the sink asked me, \"Are you going to ride the bull?\" \"No, not tonight.\" \"C'mon, why not?\" She asks. Followed by, \"You're in Vegas!\" So, because I'm in Vegas I am required to indulge in every stupid gimmick they throw at me? Not to mention that getting whipped around like a ragdoll after filling my tummy with sangria, spicy salsa and cheesy enchiladas doesn't sound like a good time AT ALL.  And now let's talk about the food. I love tapas. I love, love LOVE tapas, because I can never decide what I want. Tapas gives me the opportunity, neigh, the RIGHT to taste everyone else's food. If you're definition of tapas is \"small\" plates, then they only sort of nailed it. In my experience, the great thing about a truly authentic tapas experience, is that each dish is just enough to taste and share, and the cost of each dish reasonably reflects what you get. Here's the thing; I had no idea Chayo was considered \"tapas\" style, because each dish was between $18 and $24. Perhaps I am incorrect in my estimations, but merely portioning out food in increments of four (4 tacos, 4 enchilades, 4 pieces of street corn) while still charging the same price as one would for a personal entree, isn't truly tapas. That's more like what I'd call \"family style\", except there isn't enough for a whole family without completely busting your bank.   Between my husband and I, we had chicken enchiladas and shrimp tacos. The enchiladas, 4 tiny hand made tortillas \"filled\" (I use the term filled loosely) with tasty meat and generously coated in a traditional red sauce. Good, but not outstanding. At first I thought I'd order the beer battered lobster tacos because it sounded good in theory, but then I thought, who in their right mind would beer batter and deep fry lobster? Is that a thing? Good, fresh lobster can stand up like a beacon of hope without much ado about nothing. Battering and deep frying feels like deception. Instead I opted for the grilled shrimp tacos. Again, four soft corn taco shells stuffed with a generous amount of shrimp, very lightly seasoned and cooked quite nicely. The tacos came with a side of creamy pinto beans seasoned with bacon and a dollop of forgettable rice. The standout on the plate was the side of beans. Was it bad? No. But for $18 each, I expected, if not a larger portion, a more immaculate flavor. And how can I forget Sangria. I can easily kill a pitcher of good Sangria on my own, but opted to share a $32 pitcher with some friends. Tapas, right? The pitcher, 80% ice was enough for about 4 glasses. Deep glasses, yes, but glasses that were also 80% full of ice. I only drank 1 glass. Why? Because it tasted like it came from a premixed bottle. No chunks of apple or other fruit. Just ice and watered down flavored wine...deeply disappointing.   Ultimately, like most restaurants on the strip (save those run by the big wigs), Chayo is a lot of hype, loud music and party it up vibe. For food and drinks? Save your money for the food trucks downtown, where the focus is on the food and not the drunken idiot on the mechanical bull",

We noticed that this place was the busiest restaurant out of all the other restaurants in the Linq so we decided to have dinner here. There was a wait to be seated out on the patio so we chose to dine inside which had no wait.  Our waitress was very friendly, she had a smile the whole time we were there. She took our orders and within 10 minutes, our food came out. I ordered the slow roasted rib eye tacos, my boyfriend ordered the fish tacos, and our friend ordered the avocado salad. Everything was good and tasty, but I wish we had ordered some appetizer as we still hungry.   There's a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant and it was very fun to watch people ride and fall off. The music level would go up and down depending on if anybody is on the bull.  The restrooms are a little out of the way as it is on the second level and we had to take the elevator. There were stairs but the stair were roped off. And once we were on the second level, there were no signs to direct us where to go. But we asked a staff member who pointed us to the right direction.  I definitely like the atmosphere here and will most like return with maybe a bigger group.",

    "text": "I ate here twice while I was in Vegas for 5 nights, and I will most likely go back. Of all the meals I've eaten in Vegas over the years, it was probably in my top three Best breakfasts, which says a lot!  First off, it is located almost directly in the middle of The linq promenade, which is definitely a hot area of the strip now. It is directly between the linq hotel and the flamingo, so the location is excellent.  You can access it through the outside, as well as the inside of the casino, so it's very convenient.   The layout of the restaurant is great, and I love the fact that there is a nice outdoor area if you are tough enough to brave the Vegas heat. If you are slightly less daring, the inside is nicely laid out with great thought to the Mexican influenced interior decoration. They also have a roof patio, although I was not able to experience that this time.   I was extremely happy with the staff, as both waiters I had were knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. I even left my backpack behind in the restaurant, and didn't notice it until a half an hour later as I was sitting at the roulette table. When I rushed back, our waitress Daniela had put it in the back to keep it safe, and went and retrieved it for me. I was very impressed by this. That alone will get me to come back.   As I mentioned before, the food here is wonderful. As a Mexican restaurant, it says a lot that I was eating there with a Mexican, and she loved it too! I feel like that's a wonderful endorsement. I tried something new for breakfast, and I couldn't believe how good it was... I was honestly thinking about it for the next few days. The food is fresh, well prepared, and the menu is diverse. They even have a Booth outside on the street that sells tacos, beer, and Mexican street corn (elote and esquite, I think)  The prices here are a little on the higher side, but you also expect that in Vegas, especially considering the location. It also didn't bother me considering the fact that I had a wonderful meal, which makes it worth it. They have a great business here, and I can't wait to try it again, especially at night for the evening scene.",

I asked for an extra shot of sauza in mine and watched the (very rude) bartender pour a no name tequila in it. When I interrupted him he looked at me and very condescendingly say \"oh no you're wrong we don't even carry that sauza anymore\" I told him I wouldn't have even ordered it then and he just looked at me and made a face and said \"sorry\" while pushing the drink back towards me. I won't ever be coming here again. I don't like being lied to and I especially don't like being talked to the way I was talked to- I know the bartender could have made me whatever other margarita I wanted and taken the house off my bill because the menu description is False. Sorry chayo, I'm a local and you just lost my business.",

The food came out pretty fast, but we still hadn't gotten our drinks. Some of our party was 1/2 way through our meals before all the drinks arrived, and one person still hadn't gotten their food (nachos). The bill was another issue. While the server discounted our meals for the service issues, it took 3 times to split the bill up correctly (we were 4 couples and one single). Another surprise, there is a second tax \"CNR\" in addition to sales tax on our meal. This is charged to help pay for the stadium, but only Cesar's Palace properties are charged this??",

This restaurant is located in the Linq hotel.   We showed up really late for our reservation but the hostess was really nice and still sat us right away.   Our server came over to greeted us right away and was super nice and pleasant the whole night. He took really good care of us.   My friend and I each ordered blended strawberry margaritas and we were not very happy with them. We started with the chicken nachos as an appetizer. They were okay, nothing special. The chicken was kind of dry.   For dinner I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Again, they were okay, nothing special and the chicken was kind of dry.   This restaurant has a good ambiance and a fun atmosphere but the food is mediocre at best. If you're looking for some really good Mexican food in Vegas, look elsewhere.   On the plus side, there is a giant mechanical rooster that you can ride in the middle of the restaurant! If you enjoy riding a mechanical bull, then I would give this a try (it's pretty much the same thing, just a different animal.) Our table was right next to this and we had so much watching",

Tried the ribeye, carnitas, and breaded lobster soft tacos. Split everything with my brother. Loved the carnitas the best personally, but I think my brother preferred the ribeye. Couldn't go wrong with the margaritas at all.  It was hopping because of how many people from the conference that were there, so service took a bit. Can't complain too much because we enjoyed the drinks and the scenery.   They do have a mechanical bull on the main floor that has a weight limit, much to my little brother's dismay.   Great food on the pricy side without the special. Still worth checking out for the good eats.",

Once the food arrived all was saved..it was delicious!  We tried most appetizers on the menu and various style tacos, the tuna, and a few other selections.  The food, the presentation, the timeliness of receiving the food once ordered were all excellent.  There's a bull to ride in the center of the restaurant (if you're in to that sort of thing) and it provided interesting entertainment throughout dinner.  If your at the Linq, i would say, stop in for a nice lunch or dinner, just not if your in a hurry!",

Service was also very good & decent value for the money- esp for Vegas. Definitely going to go back. The only weirdness was the music that was reggeton in Spanish. No traditional Mexican music. Decor was good.",

    "text": "We ended up here completely by accident. We were running out of time to watch a show and decided to check this place out because it didn't seem too busy for a Saturday evening.  First we entered the restaurant via the Quad. Upon entering we approached the hostess stand where 2 hostesses were standing. Neither one greeted my girlfriend and I and had my girlfriend not said said anything, who knows how long we would  been standing there.  We were seated immediately. The server was polite and helpful taking our drink orders immediately and giving us ample time to peruse the menu.    Now for the drinks, my girlfriend ordered the Don margarita and ordered another cocktail called the Office. Drinks were pricey at $14 each but I guess it was to be expected on the strip.  We weren't too impressed with them and ended up ordering 2 beers.  We ordered chips and salsa ($3) & for our meals,  my girlfriend ended up ordering the Manchego burger ($16) and I ordered the carnitas ($13 for 3).  The chips weren't bad and the salsa was tasty with just enough kick to be able to enjoy it.  My girlfriends burger was tasty and nicely seasoned with a side of fries. The carnitas however, were tasteless and extremely oily! Initially I thought what I was seeing was the lime juice I had squeezed over them, but I realized it was oil and I literally had to pick up each taco and tilt it to drain the oil.  I held each taco up for at least 10 seconds before I attempted to eat them. Total bill before tip $79.99.  Overall, service was ok at best & the food - nothing to get excited about. We agreed the best thing was the chips & salsa.  Would we come here again? No...and neither would we recommend this place to anyone looking for good Mexican food. Sorry.",

My girl was in the mood for Mexican and while i had my reservations about this place, i agreed to give it a try.  I had the Oaxacan  chopped salad and while it's presented nicely, the visual appeal was as good as it got.  I'm  still trying to figure out how could so many ingredients lack any taste.  Even the grilled chicken was bland.  Not even the slightest hint of salt or pepper. The \"enchiladas\"were basically their tacos drenched with red sauce. The drinks were good so if what i had primarily come for would have been a few rounds while watching people take turns on the mechanical bull,  i would likely have rated this place higher. But i didn't so i won't.  Drink here but eat elsewhere",

The first chips we got were stale, the second few that came with the guac were really good, but the second set were a little stale too.  The drinks took forever and came out seconds before our meal.  The food actually came out pretty quick, but they messed up one of our orders of tacos. The refire actually took longer to come out then the original meal. Everyone had finished when the new order of tacos came out. The salsa was average at best. We ended up not eating any of the salsa and hardly any of the stale chips. I kind of expected them to comp us something for a pretty bad experience, but they even charged us $3 for the child and salsa that we basically didn't even eat. Needless to say with all the other options I won't be going back. Save your money and go to Cabo Wabo at Planet Hollywood instead",

We were sat immediately only to sit ten minutes without being greeted and the restaurant was not very busy (about 50% occupancy). Eventually, someone came over and asked if we had been helped and when we said no he was very surprised and grabbed our drink orders. The entire night was a disaster since the beginning, our waters went unfilled and our server disappeared for twenty minutes at a time, making it difficult to order and refill our drinks. On top of the terrible service don't expect to have a conversation here, you'll find yourself screaming and at loss of a voice by the end of your disappointing experience. Also, this place is not group friendly and will not even split a bill up into two bills. I would also not recommend this place for children, between the gigantic bull in the middle of the restaurant and the choice to blast tasteless music, it is very apparent this is not a kid friendly environment.  My group and I could overlook the errors and lack of service if the food was good but they couldn't even nail that. A lot of the items we ordered were greasy and thrown onto the plate. The only compliment I can award is for the guacamole which is comparable to Chipotle but at $9 cost.",

One of our drinks was to have habanero in it. None at all. Very sweet. Over priced and poor quality.  When it comes to the food think of On The Border. Maybe not even that good. Out server was nice but had too many tables. Service lacked. Warning that once you order food it come quickly. If you want to enjoy a drink and appetizer then do not order your main meal with the rest of your meal.  Also this place is LOUD. Pure Vegas. I suggest skipping this place.

Prices are pretty typical for being on the strip and at first glance the $20 bottomless mimosas seemed like a lot, but I got my money's worth.  I ordered the classic breakfast - 2 eggs, chorizo, and potatoes.  It was just okay.  The eggs were like egg beaters and there were more potatoes than anything else.  The chorizo was also pretty dry.  My husband's tacos tasted much better so I might recommend something other than the classic breakfast!  It was fun being able to people watch, but it was also very loud with a few street performers nearby.  I would most likely not return for food and would venture off the strip instead for Mexican food or would just stop by to enjoy drinks and the patio.",

When I approached I was told no outside drink is allowed and yes I totally agreed so I have asked them to trash the rest of the drink (about quarter left) and the lady spoeken to us gave us rude attitude. Okay, we were seated at the table but no one approached us for more than 15 mins. I think it is worst customer service for a restaurant to not to acknowlege a group of customers. It was such a disgusting feeling to be seating there without any attention at a hungry dinner time. So we decided to walk out. It's even waste of giving one star. TOTALLY WASTE OF TIME, TRASHED DRINK AND ONE STAR!!! PLEASE VISIT IF YOU WANT TO BE IGNORED AND RUIN YOUR VACATION AND TIME.",

Although my mango margarita was  a bit too full of fruit at the bottom and was hard to suck thru the straw it looked pretty. Just took me awhile to drink it lol. My friends orders beer and spicy jalapeno watermelon margs. It's on the strip so it is a bit pricey-FYI A tiny cheese dip w chips was @ $12. Double what you're prob used to paying but again-everything on the strip is pricey. The door was open so me And the other two guests were freezing but the new girl Bartender said it felt great-I guess customers aren't always right. Wish they wuda shut that door. Otherwise they've also got a bull people can ride so that was good for a laugh/entertainment. Nice upscale joint in the middle of the Linq.",

First off, it was close to St. Patrick's Day and the music was blaring (very loud) Irish music the entire time we were there.  There were also these annoying bright green lights shining at us.    Our waitress was good.  She made sure we were taken care of.  The food was somewhat good.  We started with some chips & salsa and then some of the taquitos.  Both were really good.  Salsa was spicy, but that's how I like it.  For my meal I had the Carnitas.  I loved the Mexican Rice and the pork tasted good, but there was a huge glob of fat in it which was a real turn off.  I know pork has fat, but it isn't very appetizing like that.  They were delicious, despite the globule of fat, but also different than carnitas I've had before.    Overall, would I come here again?  I know it's a bar, but turn the music down.  I hate having to yell at someone sitting at my table just so they can hear me.",

As with most restaurants on the Strip it's a bit pricey for what you get, but the food was good and the service was great. The only real issue I had was that they wouldn't let me bring in my coffee from Starbucks. I get not allowing open containers but...it was a Starbucks cup with a lid. Seems a bit much.   I had the \"Mexican style\" Philly cheesesteak and as a sandwich it was good - basically a philly but with chipotle mayo instead of regular, Mexican style cheese instead of provolone, and jalapeno peppers in addition to red peppers. They maybe could have gone a bit more extra with it but the steak on the sandwich was surprisingly good quality and I liked the sandwich overall.   Our server was attentive without being overly so, and really friendly. It was also fun/funny to watch people ride the mechanical bull now and again while we were there!",

Went here for a work dinner after a day of meetings! I order the steak fajitas and a Berry mojito. The steak fajitas were just not hitting like they should have; the meat was too chewy and didn't have any flavor behind the sizzle; there was nothing there. In addition the two drinks I had were not strong at all; and in Vegas one would assume that they would be.  One thing that this place has going for it self is the location - awesome location in an alley way of sorts close to the Linq hotel on the strip! IMO there are other places in Vegas that should warrant your patronage.",

We decided to share some Carnitas tacos and Mexican Street Corn.  The shredded pork and avocado salsa was pretty decent!  They make their shells in house and I always think that makes a huge difference.   The avocado salsa had a great zing of flavor.  The beans that accompany the tacos were just ok.  I would opt for a different side.  The Mexican street corn was really tasty.  I love the blend of flavors covering the delicious side dish.    I wouldn't mind coming back for another go. I would hope service is better in the dining area.  They have plenty of variety on their menu for a second chance.",

The waiter was rude and I felt mistreated, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any one. The worse part of it all was when I asked for coffee  and the waiter said \"to go around the corner there's a Starbucks over there\". We all received our food on time but one person , after bringing it up to the waiter that he forgot a plate he said \" we are no longer serving breakfast and handed us the lunch menu \" Mind you.. by this time  ALL my family was already having breakfast.

    "text": "In a city rarely distinguished by subtlety, most people's first thoughts of Las Vegas involving the flashing lights of slot machines or the pulse pounding beat of a club, it seems hard to image anyplace being \"too much,\" yet as dinner of Saturday proved there actually may be a point of diminishing returns at a place like Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar where the Food and Drink somehow get lost in the spectacle.  Now approaching its fourth anniversary, one of The Linq's few opening-day venues that has not changed name or concept, it was earlier this year that Chayo came under the same management as HeXX Kitchen + Bar at Paris, Chef Steve Aguglia taking over as top toque and freshening up a menu that spans from Tacos and Burritos to innovative daily Breakfast and Dinner Specials.  Open from 8am until midnight or later daily, a Taco and Margarita Cart out front tempting passers-by as loud music overflows the promenade, guests entering Chayo will immediately find themselves engulfed in a Tex-Mex wonderland comprising everything from Sombreros and Luchador Masks to a Mechanical Bull, the Hip-Hop soundtrack later spun by a DJ fairly incongruous with the concept, particularly during NFR Rodeo weekend.   Eventually becoming accustomed to the scene, a process aided by excellent service provided by a College-age woman who kept up with Food and Beverage orders over the course of nearly two hours, it was with Cocktails in hand that Chips, Salsa, Guacamole and Queso Fundido were all served simultaneously, the housemade nature of each making them better than the typical Mexican joint with the smoky Salsa and Cheese Dip that never showed a sign of coagulating particularly stand-out.  Dining as a quartet and thus doing a lot of sharing, many of the items re-portioned or plated in order to facilitate this given the immense size of a comfortable leather booth, it was with a plate of Wings ordered for the youngster that adults were presented shallow bowls of Tortilla Soup filled with shredded Chicken and bold aromatics, a follow-up of two styles of Tostada really a tossup as to which was better, though the addition of Mango Vinaigrette to Spicy diced Tuna made it pretty hard to top.  Approximately half-full early but swelling with a mix of Cowboys and verbose tourists as the hours passed, Televisions showing Hockey and Basketball joined by a live feed of Buckin' Broncos and Calf-Roping, it was just prior to Tacos being presented that a Photographer selling commemorative pictures stopped by to peddle her goods, a Magician soon to follow and finally two scantily clad Jack Daniels ambassadors selling $5 shots and 'swag.'  Finding far more value in warm Tortillas packed with Chicken Al Pastor, Green Chili Pork or Carne Asada than any of the gimmicks, though a $10 Mechanical Bull ride was well-worth the thirty seconds of fun before being unceremoniously thrown to an airbag below, it was upon return to the table that two Enchiladas proved to be Chef Aguglia's very best dish, the Short Rib tender amidst spicy Rattle Chile Sauce while the Roasted Corn fared even better alongside Cheese and strips of Mushrroms.  Fairly full at this point, tablemates taking only small bites of Rib-Eye plated atop Onions, Potatoes and a surprisingly convincing housemade Mole, it was with most of the medium-rare Beef finished that all four of Chayo's Desserts capped things off, the light Sponge Cake holding up well despite being sopping wet with Condensed Milk and Boozy Cream while the Brownie and Bread Pudding were both rich and delicious, though no match for what might just be the sweetest and creamiest Flan in town.  ***1/2:  Offering superior Food and vastly better service than one might guess, the only real issue being an almost overwhelming amount of competing 'activity,' Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar undoubtedly fits what many both love to criticize about Las Vegas dining, though it would be hard to name a better place serving this style of food on the Strip at such a portion and price-point.",

They had margarita specials, but only on the rooftop bar.  That was the only thing I didn't care for-I would have liked to have a $5 margarita, but didn't feel like sitting on the rooftop when the people watching was so much better near the walkway between the restaurant and the bars and hotels in the Linq.    We had been there a few years ago and enjoyed a margarita in the same seating area.   Highly recommend.",

It never came!  I went to the bar and got our waters!  Finally the waiter came and ask for our drink order, 1/2 hour later our drinks arrived!  Then we ordered breakfast, one hour later, it came!  Geez!  Then we were never ask for more water or coffee.... we ordered coffee and 20 mins later the coffee came COLD!  We ask the bus boy for hot coffee and 20 more mins later the coffee came and for two people; 117.00.   For breakfast!!!! OMG!   Are u kidding me!!!!  We were at breakfast for 1-1/2 hr.

It's expensive so you would think the service would be great. However, we approached the hostess and told her we were a party of 3 and needed a table inside. She grabbed menus, turned around, and started walking inside WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. Ummm \"are we supposed to follow her??\" I guess so. So we were seated. Waited 20 minutes for our waitress to finally come to our table to take our drink order. 20 minutes!! We ordered margaritas and our daughter had a sprite. Five minutes later, she brought over the sprite. 15 more minutes pass by and still no margaritas!! Finally a different waitress brings us our drinks. Our food comes 20 minutes after that. It was good. Our waitress never came to check on us or ask if we needed anything. Then the waiting for the bill begins. Our waitress was horrible and ruined what was supposed to be nice evening out for us. We will never be back to this place.",

The waitress apologized, it was evident that the restaurant was grossly understaffed. I spoke to a manager at the end and he was useless.

We waited a while longer than we should after we got seated before anyone approached us and then waited a bit longer after we ordered our first round of drink but after that things were fine and the waiter was on point from there on.    I ordered the shreded pork enchilads and they were fantastic. They were not smothered in cheese or sauce like some places, just enough sauce and cheese so as not to overpower all the other flavors going on. We ordered guacamole and some queso fundido for appetizers. The guac was very good, a nice amount of spice and pomegranate seeds made for a different and unique taste. The queso fundido was ok, I have had much better.   All in all it was a good experience and I would definately return or recommend to a friend.",

I ordered the beer battered fish tacos and my wife got the Diablo shrimp. The shrimp was just too good. Couldn't resist having it though it was super hot/spicy.. I highly recommend this place and will come back for sure when I'm in Vegas the next time. It is way better than the overhyped buffets at all the casinos..

    "text": "I'm giving the restaurant a 4 for service, location and food. We had a work event at this restaurant during the day time (it was a lot more open since it was a weekday) with about 30 people.   We were able to choose from a four course menu and, as we were choosing, we had chips and salsa that were very tasty.  For the first portion of the course, you had the option of either the Caesar salad or the cilantro cream soup.  I had the Caesar salad. It was an interesting take on the salad because it was a wedge with what looked like a fried chip (it was a sheet of fried cheese). There was also an anchovy on the side (that wasn't my cup of tea). Overall, it was pretty good.   For the second portion, I got the carnitas. It was good, especially with the lime. It was a little messy to eat though.   For the third, I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Not my favorite of the four I received... It needed some spice to it.   The flan was amazing! I am pretty picky with flan since my dad makes the best kind in my opinion but this flan was not too sweet and not too thick! Definitely perfect ending to a very large meal.   At the end of our course, the chef came out to introduce himself and thank us for coming. The waiters throughout the stay continued to fill our waters and they were very good at making sure we were okay. I definitely appreciated the service here!  The location was awesome! We were upstairs and there's a balcony overlooking the Linq area and the High Roller. Mind you, this was in the morning so I'm sure it is a beautiful spot at night. It's definitely a great restaurant and I disagree with the reviews given so far.   As far as price, I'm not very sure. Since it was a work event I'm not sure how much our management paid. However I'm assuming it was affordable. The plates were small but after eating that four course meal I was definitely super full!! So it's worth it.   I believe this place deserves more than just 2-3 stars!",

It's so loud that we can't hear our waitress or each other at our small four top booth. Absolutely obnoxious.  The manager needs to reconsider the volume of the music. Are you a club or a restaurant? You can't be both.  They earn points for decor. Service so far is kind of slow but our waitress has been really nice. We'll see if the food earns them a star.   Ordered margaritas and left. It's a shame because we were looking forward to trying this place.",

We were here last Sunday with a group of 6 because the kind for Hash House was incredibly long and we were hungry. The food here is terrible and I'd compare it to diner food, but the diners I've been to have better food than Chayo. It's not just the food, the service is subpar --- who asks their server for a drink 3 times & gets a dumbstruck reaction every time like it's the first time they've ordered it? We shouldn't have been surprised, but we got the drink after we got our food. We had to ask for it to get comp'd when it should've been something offered & a manager should've came tour table, especially after every salad we ordered came DRY & only 1 person asked for \"dressing on the side.\" At one point, someone other than our server came to our table to double check on the salads (after we asked for dressing), however, they didn't identify themselves as a manager if they were one.  It's really a shame that this places sucks because the designers made it beautiful and reminds me of a Javier's look, but they've got a long way to go to earn their 5 stars.",

Aside from expensive and poorly executed meals (undersauced, lack of condiments, up charges for sides of sour cream and additional dressings for the salads because they were dry as a bone), the service was inexcusably slow with lack of attention. After 35 minutes for our entrees to be served, the two servers had absolutely no idea how to serve or even who the entrees belonged too. They repeatedly reached over us to serve the table, over handled the dishes (meaning, picking them up and down off the trays trying to figure out which entree it was, never mind who it belonged too).   $100 for enchiladas ($18), fish tacos ($18), $24 for field green salads and chips & salsa (no alcohol, mind you), seems excessive for not great food and  substandard service!!

A friend just moved to town and wanted tacos so I thought it would be the perfect time to try it.   I understand it's Saturday night, but this place is not a club (although people were dancing as there's a DJ), and the music was so unbelievably loud. We didn't want to sit outside because it's so hot so we just had to deal with it.  If you want a place you can sit and eat and have a conversation, this is not it.   The service was good, but the food was pretty disappointing. My friend said his steak tacos were good, but my steak burrito was abysmal. The food came out really fast (which worries me), and mine wasn't exactly hot. The steak, which was sparse, had quite a bit of fat, and the quality of it as a whole was lacking. And you can't order just a side of guacamole, at least I didn't see it under 'sides'.   I agree with the other reviewers that the bull riding is incredibly entertaining, as it is anywhere, so there's that.   Kinda wish I had just taken him to Roberto's haha",

    "text": "Giving this three stars as I have personally been there three times so far and finally writing my review now. I was disappointed on how long service took the first day as the dining room was very slow, and the bar had around 9 people at it. Upon sitting down and ordering drinks and appetizers we did not receive our drinks until 20 minutes later and our chips and queso app took around 30 minutes to come out. Thirty minutes on a app like that is horrendous, Upon receiving the app finally we did not receive chips but ended up with soft taco shells? Wow.  Upon waiting another 10 minutes on our server it took 15 minutes to just get chips with that and they were flavorless with no seasoning or anything. The best way to describe the taste is close to cardboard. The queso with the chips was also just bland and disgusting and really dry and cold prior to us recieiving our chips.  Moving onto our second visit we just had margaritas which were OK and I would honestly get them again. Still waited around 10min just to get them tho. Our third visit I was still in disappointment as well due to the fact that we received chicken tacos that were shredded but were tender, dry and cold at the same time. If you work in a kitchen I feel like they have been sitting in a deep third and not stirred around to keep proper temperature. I also ended up getting a side of Fry's that were meh, they need more seasoning.  Ending my review if you are looking for margaritas, Chayo is a decent place. Food wise it will be hit or miss.",

The server made it exactly how we wanted it. The chips were crispy and tasty. Drinks were fantastic!!! Music was on point!!!  I need to give a shout out to the incredible Master Chef Saul. His selection of exquisite and flavorful dishes were so delicious! Saul is amazing. Thank you Saul for the MOST memorable birthday EVER ;-) PURA VIDA!!! Our server Victor was awesome! Such great service. The entire staff made us feel like VIP's.  I would definitely recommend Chayo for anyone wanting a hot and spicy evening full of fun and laughter.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised with this place after reading everyone else's reviews. My boyfriend and I first went to the bar first since we were super early for our reservation time.   The service was great but the margarita I got was nothing special. It was the Chayo margarita and I honestly could not taste any alcohol in it at all.   For dinner we moved over to the dining area where we got to enjoy dinner and a show when a group of older ladies decided to give the cock a ride. Pure entertainment!  The food was pretty great too! We had the chips and salsa and guacamole as starters since I couldn't decide between the two. I loved the salsa! It was very fresh tasting and just the right amount of spice. The guacamole was good too but nothing too spectacular.  For entrees we had the shrimp tacos and burger. I personally loved my tacos! My boyfriend said the burger was good too. We will definitely be back soon! Looking forward to trying out taco Tuesday's that our waiter recommended!",

My friends had walked by here the night before in search for food and said it looked like it was a lot of fun so we decided to give it a try.  The place is two stories with a small space, bar and bathrooms upstairs.  But downstairs is where the fun is at.  We got there at around 11p, and they were still serving food which was nice.  We didn't get any food, just ended up ordering some drinks at the bar.  The bar doesn't get overly crowded which is nice and the drinks are fairly priced.  There is a mechanical rooster smack dab in the middle of the floor. Yeah, you read that right. 2 of my friends went on it and it was nothing but pure entertainment watching everyone else give it a go.  Music here was perfect and there's an outdoor patio and the doors stay open so there's a nice break from the heat every now and then.   Definitely would return.",

    "text": "Came here on a late Saturday night. We were already at the Linq Promenade meeting some out of town friends and family members. We were all in agreement to just stay at the Linq since we were not in the mood to drive elsewhere. We just wanted to find  a place to have a few drinks and party a little, since there was a birthday girl in the group. I recommended Chayo, since they don't have one in San Diego and everyone was already familiar with Yard House. Good point. We like trying new places.  The food was \"ok\" but not great. It will do the job if you are hungry, but it is not the best tasting or worse Mexican food I have ever had. We ordered the steak quesadilla with beans n rice and chicken nachos. Huge servings. Enough food for 3-4 people to share the nachos. The chicken was a bit dry though. Overall, food was a 6 on a scale of 1-10. Just ok...nothing special.  The margaritas on the other hand was way too sweet for my liking. We ordered a pitcher and after 4 sips, the sugar buzz kicked in. No bueno!! They added too much orange juice to the mix to where the margarita had a orange hue instead of a green hue from the limes. Not good for a $32 price! Minus two stars!!!  Overall we had a great time!! The place got busy as the night progressed. The dj was playing some great Latin party tunes along with some house n hip-hop music. The saving grace was the mechanical rooster right in the middle of the dance floor. That was so entertaining to watch buzzed folks brave the cock ride and hold on for dear life...lol!! The falls were hysterical! Especially from gals  trying to twerk on the rooster to epic fail!!  We made our cousin's wife ride the cock in honor of her birthday. She did great and looked like a pro bull rider!   The main reason for my 3 stars was the entertainment factor of the mechanical rooster, along with the service we received that night. Our waitress was sweet, helpful and always available.   I will come again, but not anytime soon. It was just a place we did not have planned to go and we ended up there, having a good time and laughs due to the Chayo mechanical rooster and up beat Latin music vibe. Stay away from the poorly made margaritas! Don't expect \"really good\" Mexican food either. Food is just...ok.",

So I ended up paying $31 for an $18 dollar burrito and a water when they included the gratuity. The bill was split into 3 we each paid $9 gratuity. In what world does that make sense.

Also annoying - sign downstairs says Happy Hour on the Patio and points up.  When you get up, they immediately block you from the patio and say its closed.  I say well then take down the sign... they dont care.  Terrible upstairs overheated room, stuffy, not worth the average tacos.",

The restaurant had a sign outside for a special deal which caught our eye and lead us to go in. We asked the server for the deal and he told us there's no such thing. Explained to him that the sign is outside and he said it's an old sign, we don't offer that anymore. They weren't very busy, but it took them over 30 minutes to bring out the food. The busboy who brought out the food spilled the sauce on a coat and offered to take it to the back to clean since they have a dryer. The manager offered to pay the bill for fry cleaning if it still needed to be done. How was he going to pay when we don't live in Vegas? Venmo?   Food itself wasn't bad. Ordered the fish tacos.   Overall, shady experience. Wouldn't go back.",

We waited 5 more minutes to get our taco and waiter said he had no control over the kitchen and was put off that I requested it come asap. He hadn't offered more water or bothered to clear our menus. Terrible service all around. Would never return. Clearly they do not train their employees well.",

I tried to explain that there was so much bad in the world and why as adults would we want to expose our children to it... but I believe she was just a miserable person.  She was upset because she was a bigger girl and my husband is not the smallest either and both sitting back to back did not give adequate room.  I had changed places once already because the door was open which in turn caused it to be quite cold.  When they sat down she became quite vile in her demeanor.  I had enough and had to challenge her and bring some self awareness of her behavior and actions to light...I apologized that my family was bigger and that her behavior was uncalled for I attempted to educate her but she only grew more upset eventually I apologized for her unhappiness and left.  I knew she was just an unhappy person when she had the audacity to complain about a glass of water.  I will stay home and enjoy our meals as a family instead of exposing my child to the anger of the world.  Please be kind to one another and pay it forward, let's educate people on happiness",

Not just with us but the other tables he was overseeing as well.  He took our drink orders and in a short turn around time he was bringing them to us then he took our order.  Matt was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  Our food came so hot, it had to sit for a minute so we could eat it, It was exactly as we ordered, We never felt rushed to vacate our table.  We are looking forward to our next visit so we can experience some other items from the menu!",

Don't bother coming here especially if you are celebrating something. I made a reservation here for our friend's anniversary.  Stopped in 3 hours before our reservation to tell them it was a special occasion and the girl at the front desk put it on our reservation and said they'll give them a free dessert \"or something\".  I also showed her a  food coupon from the casino to make sure they would honor it (which previously  they have) and she said yes they do honor it. WELL when the bill came the manager came over and said they don't honor the coupon, that the restaurant is not owned by the casino. WHAT! I told him I was told today that it was accepted and that I have used the coupon in the past but he said no.  The waiter acknowledged the anniversary when we first sat down but NOTHING was done NOTHING. He just asked who's anniversary is it and walked away. Totally embarrassed me and I went out of my way to ensure nothing like this would happen. Very poor management. This place went south. Even the food was terrible. No one liked their food because it was way too salty. My chicken was rubber.  My frozen margarita was good but my friends ordered a pitcher of margaritas and said it was horrible. Too many good restaurants in Vegas skip this one. A total screw up!",

If your at the bar Danielle was extremely friendly and helpful. Top class hospitality from her. And Conrad the bartender was awesome. Very knowledgeable of all the drinks and polite. They were easy to engage in conversations with. Drinks were great had the Don Margarita and the Office speciality cocktails. A bit pricey but can be expected on the strip.   Food was great just had tapas ribeye taco. Great flavor. Will definitely come back and try other menu options. Overall the service was better than I expected due to the friendly staff. Location is great over at the Linq. I highly recommend to check this place out!!   Perry",

It should be advertised as more of a club and not a restaurant if that's what they want to promote. We were there on a Saturday night at about 8:30 and we asked to be seated more in the back booths because we couldn't hear each other and they said we had to buy a bottle to sit in a booth. There is no dance floor and this is not a club so I thought it was total bs. 2nd, the food was horrible and totally overpriced. 3rd, we got 2 flights of patron tequila shots and I really doubt they actually gave us patron. I've been a bartender and it tasted more like cheap bottom shelf tequila. And it took like 30 minutes to get our drinks even though it was not crowded at all. 3 plates of tacos and 2 flights of crappy tequila cost $120. Rip off. We will never go back.",

    "text": "I ate here with a couple of my girlfriends for Cinco de Mayo.  We read the mediocre reviews but decided to give the restaurant a chance anyway, and we ended up being really disappointed.  We arrived and our server, while flighty, was friendly enough and was able to make recommendations that we appreciated.  The execution of our orders however was terrible.  She had to come back to us after our drink order and our food order because she couldn't remember what we had told her.  Two of us ordered margaritas, one came with salt and the other was missing it entirely.  Not sure how that wasn't caught before it was delivered to our table.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer for $10 and barely got enough chips to eat it (see photo).  We also ordered salsa that never came.  I ordered the shrimp fajitas which was plenty of food, but it was bland and boring.  We waited forever for our bill to come - when it finally did, our server took our three credit cards to split our bill.  She was gone for over 30 min with our cards and when she came back she didn't even remember taking our cards.  She was completely incoherent and appeared to be heavily drugged - which was really sad considering we liked her.  Her other table was also looking for their credit cards.  As it turns out, we both had the same server and she got our cards and tickets mixed up.  Our table was charged for a $300 bill when our bill was only $90.  After a long, not fun conversation with a manager, we were assured the charges would not post.  I got home today and realized that not only did they charge my card for $100 of the $300 bill, they also charged me for another table's $200 bill.  So after spending over 30 min dealing with a manager on this issue while we were at the restaurant, I now need to work through disputing charges with my credit card company and calling the restaurant again.  The restaurant could also improve on atmosphere/ambiance when a live band is playing in the plaza outside the restaurant.  The music in the restaurant competes with the live band making conversation impossible and is extremely distracting.  I would just avoid this restaurant entirely.",

    "text": "First night and Vegas, my wife and I wanted a snack so we went to Chayo Mexican Kitchen.  We didn't want to have a big meal, so we ordered a side of nachos.  We should have ordered a half of what we go.  The order was MASSIVE!  Great for anyone that loves nachos.  Only complaint I have, the guacamole was an up charge if you wanted it, which I was kind of disappointed since the item was kind on the high side as it is.  But then again, everywhere you go, the up charge you on the guacamole if you want it.  So nothing out of the ordinary.  The menu from what I could tell was on the \"$$ to $$$\" on the price range.  Which again, any restaurant in any casino on the Las Vegas Strip, this is very common!  So expect that if you come here.  The Atmosphere was great.  Noise was about average while we were there however, they had a mechanical bull in the middle of the floor!  lol  So...yeah...I'm sure the Happy Hours at this place can become quite lively!  LOL  Also, I would like to compliment them on their booths, very comfy and roomy.    Our server was pretty helpful and polite. However we did have to wait for about 10 minutes to be greeted at a time when they might have had 10 patrons in the entire restaurant.  It was odd because when you arrived, there wasn't a hostess where you think there would be.  After 10 minutes, we thought maybe they do a self-seating kind of deal for after hours!    This place is located in Harrahs, free parking....  Overall, I would give this place another chance.  Nothing that really stood out that would make or break this place at this time.  Next time will have to try an entree.",

Fidel had quite a personality and gave great service.  He brought us a breakfast burrito with all the works for $13.95 and Huevos Rancheros for the same price.  You'll find this place in the new shopping area next to the Linq Hotel.  It's a nice street to visit with quite a few restaurants and shops.  Fun for an hour or two...and this is a good place for breakfast.",

I recommend getting tortilla chips versus tortillas.  It's a lot easier to dip and share versus rolling up a tortilla.  Mexican corn was yummy and serving size is 3 half ears...perfect to share with 2 others at your table.   Service: it was awful to start but slowly improved. Although we were seated right away, we stared at our  menus for over 10 minutes. We could not find a server in site and no one acknowledged our presence. We finally flagged down a server and she sent our server to us. Once our order was taken, food came out quickly and our server did check ok us periodically for beverage refills.",

And then at the end basically threw the check on the table and walked away. Never saw him again! Then after about 2 hours of eating there my husband got really sick...cramping and nausea. The food made him sick! I called and asked to talk to the manager a few days later and left a message with Tammy and said she would have the main manager call me back - Greg Waters....of course NEVER heard from him. Pathetic service and attitude. WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN! be careful eating there...it could make you sick!",

No place for our musicians and no private sound system she basically said too bad deal with it.   Never again will I visit this Restaruant.

The salad comes and it is not  hat I expected just romaine lettuce with a few beans and pieces or corn and 3 slices of avocado and some grilled chicken. It was extremely spicy so spicy I couldn't bear to take more than a few bites. It just was not what I was expecting. I told the waiter it was too Spicy and that I couldn't eat it he offered to get me something else but I felt gross after the few bites I had he was understanding and even took it off the bill. Service was great our waiter was very sweet but i don't recommend the food if you're not into super spicy.",

But we are all for trying new places given that we already ate at el segundo once.. Anyways back to Chayo.. As soon as we walk in there's insects on our table. I order nachos for us  i ask for everything except queso.. meaning I want lettuce, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, beans, and anything besides queso & meat. Then I went ahead and ordered green enchiladas minus the chicken. I don't eat meat. And my bf went ahead and ordered Fajitas. The nachos come out and it's just CHEESE AND a bed of LETTUCE!! The cheese is still cold and not even melted!! They were very stingy with the cheese too didn't even give Us a lot but it was fine. I just asked the server why we didn't get beans and pico he said I was just told cheese and lettuce... so I said can you bring me beans and pico?  He did. Since my bf doesn't like beans  I decided to eat it on my own with a fork and when I started eating it, I tasted   CHILI  from Wendy's.. DID I ORDER BEANS OR CHILI?? I didn't believe it but then I started to examine the beans and saw PIECES OF MEAT!!! Welcome to my worse nightmare.. i ask the server if the beans has meat and he said no. I didn't believe it so I showed my server  and she apologized and then informs me that the refried beans that comes with my enchiladas are made in pork lard and the rice has chicken stock! Why wasn't I told before?? When I ordered enchiladas without MEAT! Nachos without MEAT. Why would I want beans that has pieces of MEAT and my refried beans made with pork lard! Yuck. My bf also hated his fajitas and thought they tasted disgusting. Had to walk to sprinkles cupcakes for dessert cause I did not trust that place. Only giving it two stars cuz the server was nice and we had a great view at our seat and I liked the enchiladas I customized. If you're gonna eat here then at least sit Outside.",

Shrimp, fresh jalapeno, tomato, onion in lime juice, Delicious from the 1st to last bite. Other items ordered were the chipotle wings - a little heat and tasty, the chopped salad - great flavor and the carne asada burrito. So big, you may want to split it. The margaritas were tasty and the beer was cold. Our waitress was great checking on us often. No complaints. We all enjoyed it and were excited to find another Mexican restaurant in town that we liked. We thought the prices were reasonable too. As for people watching... sit on the patio, it doesn't get any better.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying if it wasn't for the groupon I had purchased I would not have gone, nor returned again. The food was very decent, I had a large party of 18 and no one walked away loving their plate. What I can say if the coconut margarita was delicious! But when it came to paying the waiter never told us that we would not be able to split the checks! So being a retired waitress myself I broke it down for everyone and the waiter could not figure it out! Than he tells me we can only use 3 cards, which even though I was frustrated with I said fine. So I collected cash from everyone so we would specifically have 3 cards. Spent an hour there after dinner just trying to process payments because the waiter kept messing up. He had to bring me 4 different checks because again he kept messing up. Overall it was a very frustrating experience. My recommendation is that when customers call to reserve seating for larger parties than 8 you specifically tell them about your payment and splitting checks rules. This allows time for everyone to be prepared upon arrival! Not wait until after dinner to tell us. Considering I booked over a week in advance. Once we finally got out, a few days later my friend called me to tell me she had a $600 charge on her credit card from the restauraunt which was completely impossible because I paid the remaining balance at the end of $388 on my credit card! And lastly we asked to sing happy birthday for 2 people. The waiter brought out 2 desserts than charged us for both of them. Very very frustrating and unfortunately they will not receive business from neither myself or the remaining 17 in my party.",

My dish was fantastic (Diablo Shrimp) but my husbands was sent back twice because Salmon was very under cooked. Our server comp third plate because even he saw second dish was under cooked as well. Server (Nick) had the bright idea to ask cook to cook salmon sliced in half. Finally dish came back absolutely fantastic. Closed off with a flan and tasted just like back home. Service needs improvement because Nick seemed to be on his own working trying to meet everyone's needs. Drinks came late but yes food is great.",

We had a serious discussion with the manager, eventually he saw things our way and waved that nasty fee.  Rough start....hence, only 4 stars. After that...Fabulous experience!  Lots of pampering from the waiters, a magician doing card tricks for the birthday girl at our table, the cake came out with candles lit and waiters singing!  The food was very good, can't say great because it wasn't hot.  BUT...4 stars earned with yummy cocktails, good food and truly exceptional service.",

    "text": "My family and I were pressed for time and was really hungry. We literally looked at the first empty restaurant and asked for a party of 11. I wish we looked in a different direction. When we told the hostess she just looked at me like I was a crazy person for asking for a table for 11. After staring at me for a bit, she said \"ok.\" and walked away. I assumed that she was going to go look for a spot to put us, but then she never came back. We stood there for 10 minutes without anyone saying to us or helping us out. Then another woman came up to us and politely said, \"have you been help?\" She ended up seating us right away, which was really strange because that other girl just disappeared or just didn't want to help us.  Our server took our order pretty quickly and our food and drinks didn't take too long to come out either. However, once she dropped off the food, we never really saw her until she dropped off the plates. The restaurant was almost empty so I don't know what she was doing or where she went. We also didn't get any silverware with our food, so we were just waiting around for someone to drop it off for us. To top it off, when we did ask someone to help us, they responded with, \"that's not my job.\" and another person said \"I'm not allowed to bring food out.\" I have worked in a restaurant for over 5 years and this type of behavior baffles me.  The only redeeming things about this place were their margaritas, filet steak nachos, and chicken enchiladas. Those all tasted pretty good, but nothing special. However, my boyfriend ordered the Mexico city burrito and it was literally the smallest burrito I have ever seen in my life. For $18 we expected something either huge or extremely delicious, but it was neither.  Overall, horrible experience! I would have given it zero stars but the margaritas, nachos and enchiladas saved it.",

Let's start by saying that the service was great and fast, but the food was a bit disappointing.   FOOD:  Filet Steak Nachos $19 :On the menu it said enough for two, but when it came out \" MAN\" it's big enough for 4 people. The flavor was great, but the filet steak was pain and wasn't season  or wasn't season enough!    Beer Battered Lobster Tacos  $19: I was disappointed with this dish. The presentation was nice and everything ,but the star of the dish the lobster was way over cook . It was super dry and chewy. The chipotle mayo they put on was very good tho.   Sorry Chayo I'm just not a fan yet !",

Our waiter seemed nice and got our drink order, we got our pitcher of margarita which tasted only like marg mix with no tequila. We got our margaritas at 1pm, it then took 40mins for the waiter to come back to take our order. We didn't get our food until 2:15. We shouldn't have waited over an hour and a half just to have our order taken. The food was good, very pricey as you may expect in Vegas. Overall terrible service awareness for a relatively empty restaurant and not a good experience. We should have just waited for hash house a go go.   TLDR; just go to hash house a go go.",

Dinner by comparison was a disappointment for me. We entered because the reception desk was empty. We were ushered back outside only to be quickly escorted back in. We were seated, but overlooked for several minutes. Our order was taken and drinks were brought to the table, then more than 15 minutes passed before we caught any of the servers' attention. They were gathered around the register. When we inquired about our chips with salsa and guacamole, only our chips and salsa were brought out. Then dinner was served and we again asked for the guacamole. My fish tacos were over cooked and dry. My friend ordered and raved about their butternut squash enchiladas, though.",

We hesitated to even stick around after hearing of a lack of servers but once Christina knew we were in her section it was all good from there.    We even contacted a manager to tell them that Christina single handily saved our experience AND more so saved this place from a 1 star review.  Not only was she attentive but she was friendly and gave us her full attention and detail even though we knew she was rushing to make up for a lack of other servers.    Most come to reviews to only complain and that was likely going to be the case until Christina saved the day.  What an asset to this restaurant and to the management.  Ask for her by name if you check out this place in Vegas.  Entrances from both The Linq Casino as well as outside.",

This year we had already had one in January or February and wanted to have our annual one like always in September at Chayo. I spoke to the GM, Sean, and he  was extremely nice and said that the upstairs was being used more but he would work with us. I then spoke with Maggie the events coordinator who said something completely different than Sean and and we extremely rude. After weeks of attempting to plan an event at Chayo nobody ended up calling me back. They wanted us to pay $7500 for the upstairs and a $5000 minimum for an event we do every year without these requirements. Even if at the end of the day there was new management and we had to pay the least Chayo could do was return my phone calls or emails. Long story short... Chayo doesn't value local returning customers which is a lose of business for them. Because we would have had multiple events there and brought them business.",

The taco platter came with meat in a ball on a plate beans rice and salsa. 3 tortillas were provided. I asked isn't this for 2 people. Are server just said yeah do you want more chips or something?

As a gay client; I found this offensive that I had to hear their offensive jokes. I would give 5 stars but the security personnel comments left a bitter taste to my experience. This is 2016, there's too much hatred going on in this world and to hear these types of comments before getting seated is unacceptable for a business in Las Vegas. The gay community has over $800 billion in market share - it's about time to have a diversity come-to-Jesus meeting with these individuals making ignorant and low-class comments.

You might be able to share among three people depending how much you eat. Coffee is good but gets cold quick. They need cafe de olla added to the menu.  Service was extremely catering, general manager sat us near TVs playing Jets game, he saw our Jets shirts .  He had a layout of TVs and what on...nice touch.  Walked us to our table and made sure we were okay or would have moved us. Music is diverse. Each song changes to a new genre, from Spanish to Billboard to Classic Rock. Wall decor and chandeliers are ethically chic.  We came for breakfast. TVs everywhere but it doesn't feel like a sports bar. They had a DJ station.  Definitely worth trying.

First off my friend and I came in and were seated in section that did not have many people. It took ten minutes before we decided to move to the bar, since no one came at all to help us yet. When we began to move, a number of people surrounded us asking for our order. Yeah, no. Bar time.  I got the Avocado salad which was pretty good considering it only had three small pieces of Avocado on it. It had spicy toasted pumpkin seeds, shredded cactus, and a very tart limey sauce. Not too bad.  Drinks were relatively priced, and having conversations with the bartender while he cut a thousand limes was fun.  Overall this was an ok place to go.",

Out breakfast which composed of a scramble and burrito took 45 minutes. I can only assume or ticket was lost.  Our sever ignored is Diring out wait and did not refill our tea once.  The scramble was good when it finally showed up, but not worth the wait.  Lunch a few days later was better. They had a shrimp app that was very good. The taco entre was average. The steak was way over cooked and dry.  They drinks were the highlight of the lunch. Which is to be expected I guess, after all it is a bar.",

We decided to share some tapas... Chicken gorditas, chorizo sopes & chips/guac. EVERYTHING was delicious! When I checked in on FB my cousin insisted we try the lobster tacos. We didn't get a chance to but we will definitely visit again. I really enjoyed the chorizo sopes! Great flavor and perfectly garnished!   My only disappointment...which is minor...is that they can make a michelada but not with the traditional clamato base. I would have had a few beers if they would've been able to offer a proper michelada. :(",

    "text": "Great decor, wide opened space which, I love and they even have a ride the bull.   The downfall is that the bathroom is upstairs, however if given the choice, I would definitely hangout upstairs, you get a bit of a view and it has a bar with plenty of seating.  As for the food, I can definitely say that I love the chips, love the green salsa but not a huge fan of the red salsa.  I ended up getting the pork ($26, not worth the price), which was okay, it didn't come with any but pork, which I was a bit disappointed with. I think I fort sick form it, because after dinner I did not feel well. I didn't drink any alcoholic beverage when I was there either and I was the only one that ate it.   My boyfriend got the lobster tacos, it consisted 80% veggies. The waiters messed up everyone's orders and have everyone flour tortillas and not corn (not a huge deal).   I did like the music they were playing a lot of \"old\" school hip hop.",

    "text": "I don't like to leave bad reviews, so much so that this is my first one.  I was looking for a late night meal and decided to check it out and therefore seated myself at the bar. A bartender leaving his shift informed that the other bartender at the bar would take over. After placing my order I never received help again. I motioned for the other bartender several times and was ignored each and every time. I could maybe understand if the bar was incredibly slammed and the bartender was all alone, but there were at the most 9 people at the bar who were mostly just drinking. After getting her attention, I politely asked for a manager. She disappeared for 5 minutes and told me my entire meal was covered. I sincerely appreciated that, but would've ordered more food and perhaps another drink if I only just had service. Finally I would've left a healthy tip.  Aside from the service, the food was slightly above average as were the drinks. Even if the service was excellent, I more than likely wouldn't have returned based on the food alone.",

What's her solution...make the second drink and let the ice melt in it until we're ready for it.    Overall:  Bad Service.  Bad Experience  Recommendation:  Skip this place!",

    "text": "So within the Linq next to an entrance to the Flamingo sits Chayo and certainly it was quite a fiesta..Now whether that's good or bad I guess the remainder will help determine?  It had almost a dive bar feel to me as it was a very small enclosure, but with it being NFL Sunday it did seem to house quite the mass of people..Atmosphere wise it was certainly popping, but a draw back for me was the street performers to the right from the flamingo charging pictures with a parrot..Can't say hearing those things squawk through the entire meal makes me feel like a high roller!  Foodwise I was sold on the lobster tacos..They came out in a quantity of 3 and more towards street taco size, but I did find them to be well worth it..The lobster itself came battered and fried which oddly enough worked for me and the tortilla itself did have a light feel to it and I wasn't left heavy as the meal concluded  Our server seemed a bit off though as his one liners were met with crickets and he didn't take too kindly to us not wanting to try the specials of the night..He wasn't quite his joking self when I passed on ordering the highly recommended chicken or steak burrito..It was almost as if I was in an abusive relationship and not allowed to order for myself when it came down to it   Overall I can look past a weird waiter and just say I would give this another go for a mexican craving walking around the Linq..Maybe next time I will not have to drive so that I can take in the alky and review that as well!",

Then Chris the hostess tells me you don't bring drinks into apple Bree's a and I tell him it should not matter, all casinos in Vegas allows people to bring drinks into restaurants. He says because liquor license is different so we don't do that. Then I accidentally spill salsa on the menu and he says my kids can clean that up.   The hostess is rude and so is this waiter Chris. I'm never coming to this place again. I have not eat my food yet and I'm trying to calm down and see how it taste.   Not only that it's so loud in this restaurant and the casino you can't here people talk to you. You need to be drunk in order to put up with this place.   So this review is based on the workers. So far my chips and salsa are good and I hope my mahi tacos come out good, so in the end I did talk to the manager and told him what happened.   Sad thing is, the food is very good. But the servers and hostess are very rude.",

I ordered the chicken quesadilla and split it with a friend. The plates were very generous so I was glad we split an entree. We also ordered cheese dip ($12) for the table and although it took a while (and came with tortillas, not chips), it was still pretty good. My friends ordered a pitcher of margaritas and said they tasted great. The salsa was good and so were the nachos. The nachos were also very generous and plenty for one person. My only complaint was that we had to keep asking our waiter for drink refills. It was fairly busy though so I am assuming this is why he didn't come to our table as often as I would have liked. Overall, the food was really good and the prices were average. I would definitely come here again.",

Waitress was very nice and great personality but just did not have the skills to manage two large tables (us and another).  It took probably 30 minutes to get our drink order and chops and salsa to the table for example.  Each round of drinks took so long to the point where we were just \"what's the point?\"  When they finally served the meal, we ordered another round but the drinks did not get to us until we were nearly done.  Just poor service.  The food was just okay.  Not bad but not that great either.  As a manager myself,  I believe management is the core problem here.  Great location with a great visual appeal but staff looks overwhelmed and confused.  Saw no manager which is odd for not seeing on a large table.  And there was ours and another next to us.  Improvements in management needs to happen in my opinion.   Not planning on being back.",

Right when we walked up, we didn't get the best impression as the restaurant was pretty empty as we walked through to sit on the patio. Once we got out there, the music was absolutely blaring and we could hardly hear each other talk. We asked if it could be turned down just a tad and were immediately told no because it turns into a club at night. This was at 7:30pm...   Then, it took our waiter quite a few minutes to come up and the very first thing out of his mouth was \"how do you want to do the checks\"? We proceeded to ask if we could split it up and he took our orders accordingly. Fast forward to the end of the meal (30 minutes after we were finished eating), our waiter finally came over and said there were some items he could not split. Additionally, throughout the course of the meal, he really was not very friendly or attentive. To begin, our food was not great and one member at our table thought she was given something different than what she ordered and he basically dismissed her and just brought some sauce to cover it up. He also proceeded to yell at a lady who asked him a question at the table behind us and told her to \"chill out and relax\". He also told them that the food was out of his control once he put the order in.  We got pretty fed up, so decided to express our opinions to the manager on duty. He really didn't seem concerned about the situation or how the customers felt and sort of brushed it off saying \"that's weird, he's one of our best waiters\". While they did take 20% off our bill (which was nice), I unfortunately would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. We had some fabulous dining experiences during our stay in Vegas, but this was really really sub par. I definitely would not go back.",

We had passed by it the previous day and saw a happy hour sign and decided to go back the next day to take advantage however they do not have happy hour specials on Fridays. We didn't realize what day of the week it was! Nevertheless we were starving. We ordered the nachos with chicken which was a large portion. We each ordered a meal in addition which was unnecessary because I ended up taking it to go. I got the al pastor tacos which were alright. My boyfriend had a burrito which he said was mediocre. We weren't crazy about the food. The service was pretty good and it was a cool ambience inside. There's an upstairs too where people can go outside when it's nice out. My other complaint, which is a common one, was the price. Lunch was about $60 and we didn't order drinks. My boyfriend was so hungry and since we were on vacation we just decided to go there. I wonder how the drinks are. We probably should've kept it lighter that day and gone to in-n-out burger down the promenade for lunch. Can't go wrong for what you get and the price!",

The bartenders were really nice, the place was packed, and the atmosphere was good. They have a mechanical bull in the middle which gave funny entertainment for everyone there. The music goes on until 4am or 5am which is great.   We didn't get to sit down and have dinner but I plan on trying it on our next Vegas trip.   We can't wait to come back and visit Chayo's again.",

I do love their fresh chips and salsas, the Baja style shrimp cocktail and tuna appetizer were on point! But I really do miss the Lobster!  Used to be one of the few places you could get lobster fajitas.  But the service we received today left a bad taste with me.   The place wasn't full at 3:30pm Friday on Memorial Day weekend and we were seated immediately with our choice of a table. It seemed adequately staffed but our waitress seemed to give better service to tables on either side leaving us unattended and without our drinks.  I had listened to the table next to us place their drink order after ours, but they received their pitcher of sangria and cocktails well before ours.   Roxy was taking an other order at the table on the other side when all our food arrived. I flagged her down and asked about our pitcher of Sangria and she said the bar was busy \"Sweetie\". But yet my water glass remained empty and our full food order before us. From her tone I was to understand this and wait?  But this didn't bother me as much as the way she addressed me. \"Sweetie\" \"Honey\" it just didn't sit well with me and felt condescending and disrespectful.   I was a big fan, now I have a sour taste in my mouth.  I just don't think any woman should be addressed as sweetie or honey. Unless we are in the south, even then I think ma'am would be more appropriate.   Sadly, I'm not sweet on Chayo and it is currently off my go to list.  However, bring back the lobster and I might be willing to put up with being addressed as  sweetie :)",

Waitress was super nice and brought out an extra basket of chips without us asking (the only reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is because of her quick and considerate service). Ordered beef tacos and it was awful -beef underseasoned, tortillas were stale, and beans felt out of an aluminum can. Worst of all, the two of us both had terrible stomach aches with bloating and gas for hours after that, and it really ruined our day. What a colossal waste of money and just a horrible meal overall. At the very least I expect things to be fresh on the strip due to all the traffic. Highly discourage. Will not visit again on my next trip (I stay at the linq often so that's a bummer since convenient).",

The beef was very flavorful and good...however it was very dry. The omelette/eggs was very dry. I'm not a fan of bell peppers so they were nice to substitute mushrooms without an extra charge.  The potatoes on the side were extra crispy like I like...however tasted like they were made from frozen and did not taste fresh. The English muffin was also a bit hard and chewy. The jams they provided were good. I liked the strawberry.   Our waitress had to wait on all the tables by herself. She definitely could have used some help. We had to ask for water, milk for our coffee, and butter for our English muffins. I would come back but only if I had a Groupon because there are better places to eat at the price they charge.",

The food was delicious and the portions were massive so it was worth the price we paid for. Their berry pancake was amazing. Their salsa was spicy so if you like spicy stuff, you'll love their salsa.  For my drink I got a Bloody Mary and it really hit the spot. Not only was it physically appealing but the balance of spice, salt and liquor was perfect. I would advice them to give people the drink without the straw as the rim is dipped in spices and it absolutely heightens the taste of all spices. Probably the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time.  Our server was nice but he was not efficient at all. Usually servers will take everyone's drink before moving on to the next table. Our server was nice but he literally had to come back asking for drink orders 3 times. He kept saying he forgot. It took about an hour to get our drinks. And then a half hour for our meals. Longest wait for drinks and food that I've ever experienced.  It wasn't all bad other than the slow delivery of drinks and food. If they can fix that then everything will follow suit!",

    "text": "This place is more \"White Washed\" Mexican food than authentic.  The inside of the place looked nice, but again not authentic. Skulls decorate one side of the wall and crosses decorate the other.   The service was also slow. We were a party of 9, so that might have been part of the reason.   Everything here is expensive or/and not worth the price. I paid $7 for a glass of orange juice. I wasn't really hungry so I got the tortilla soup. I think it was about $9.   The tortilla soup was okay. It tasted more like menudo without the meat.   One of the parts that does suck is that this place is one of the few on the strip that charge an CNF fee. The fee was about $1 a person.   Also what I didn't understand was that this place has a mechanical bull, but charges $10 a person if you want to ride it. Why not just make it free with a food purchase? It would make the place more lively.   I gave this place two stars for its cleanliness, location, and because the food was okay.",

The spicy pickled cauliflower and carrots weren't my favorite.    The carne asada skillet was good.  The steak was very flavorful but a little over cooked.  The molcajete red sauce wasn't noticeable on the plate and I was excited about this because I love molcajete bowls in Mexico.  We were a bit disappointed so we asked for a side of it to add and they brought us a salsa that just wasn't quite right for me.  The sauce in the molcajete bowls I've had in Mexico were just different than a standard salsa.",

Our food was delivered, not once were we asked how it was or if we would like more to drink. The food was nothing to rave about. Do not waste your time or money. There are plenty of better places in Vegas to eat with far better service.",

Unfortunately the 3 beers took another 15 minutes to get. Once we got our beers we finally got to order. This was of course not a quick process either. When we got our food, we asked for ranch and ketchup..... nothing. Asked a 2nd time..... nothing. Asked another waiter, was promised it would come..... nope! Tried to order another beer, the waitress forgot to grab them from the bar. By the time they were brought over we were literally taking our last bites. I'd like to give them the excuse of being busy cause they were on the strip but that certainly want the case. To say our experience was lacking would be an understatement. The restaurant is in a great location on the strip. The place was very clean. Sadly they just had bad enough service that I wouldn't consider returning",

As we walked up, the guy at the door stared at us for a minute, so we pulled our IDs out of our purse. He didn't even look at them, he simply asked if we were going to sit and eat or just get drinks. We said we were going to just have a few drinks, and he said, \"Ok, just go in.\" We had seen on 2 different websites, one being their own, that they had a happy hour/drink specials on Friday and Saturday nights, so we asked the girl behind the bar what those were. She was only on her 2nd night of working there, so she went to ask a \"manager.\" He told her there weren't any specials. We asked to speak with him, so he came over with an attitude and proceeded to be extremely rude in telling us he'd do 2-for-1 margaritas since we were showing him the advertisement, but that they've never had specials on Friday night. We showed him the 2nd ad and he rolled his eyes and said, \"What did I just tell you?!\" He then said we'd have to ask a manager about the ads...the girl had told us he was the bar manager. Then a few minutes later a security guy comes over and rudely tells my friend and I that we \"have to get off the chairs\" at the bar because he was going to take them upstairs. The only nice people there were the guy running the mechanical bull and the girl who had just started working there. The music was good. The drinks were gross. I doubt we'll ever go there again.",

Come to think of it, the entire staff was extremely accommodating; the hostesses didn't even hesitate to pull together multiple tables for a walk-in party of seven. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to any of my friends visiting Las Vegas in the future!",

The chips and salsa were unbelievable and the guacamole was one of my favorites ever.   As far as drinks go, I went with the servers recommendation and I must say... it did not disappoint. I enjoyed what they called the office, patron silver accompanied by lemon, cucumber soda and st germain.  Overall this was a very pleasant experience.

The service was still good and the manager treated us right. We came again the following night because the food was so good. Our server's name was Ivan. Ivan is the greatest server you could have at this restaurant, he treated us like we were part of his family. The drinks and food came out promptly. We've never had this service this good before in Vegas. We ordered dHuevos rancheros, breakfast burrito and bottomless mimosas. Tryst me Ivan made sure we were attended 100% of the time. He never missed a beat and was on point the entire time. Ivan honestly deserves a raise for raise because of his customer service and constant cone day. He is the best server to have at this restaurant hands down. If you don't stay at the linq I recommend to come down to chayo for lunch or breakfast and ask for Ivan and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. Thank you Ivan for the slaughter and the service and hopefully we run into you again.",

I realize it doesn't come with sides, but why is the burrito served in a small lasagna boat? Makes cutting it extremely hard. My margarita was weak. I wish I would have went to chipotle. Would have been better quality (that's saying something...) and less than half the price. Sooo many places to eat in Vegas. Why bother with subpar expensive food?    Fool me once Chayo, but I won't get fooled again.",

It's great hangover food for me, we walked by this nicely decorated colorful restaurant and bar after our High Roller ride, decided to give it a try, we were hungry and buzzed, nothing better than some mexican food for us at the moment!  Chose a big booth to sit down comfortably, had guacamole, chips and salsa to start, very fresh and flavorful guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it, so good, loved the spicy and salty red salsa sauce! The chips were lightly seasoned, very crispy and yummy, they didn't fill me up too much at all.  I had shrimp diablo, the shrimps were so tender in juicy flavorful sauce, very delicious! Hubby had steak fajita in medium rare, he loved the tender steak with red in the middle, it was bomb! I liked the street taco sized tortillas.   Our food was great, I had a Chayo paloma, very strong and tasty. Our waitress was so attentive and fast, impressive service!    Loved our casual Mexican dinner, relaxing and chill vibe at this restaurant was just what we needed on a Sunday night!",

    "text": "The staff here is friendly.  The decor is very nice.  That's what the two stars are for.  Otherwise, this was one of the most miserable dining experiences I've ever had.  I was there as part of a large group (40 people) and I have to say they really shouldn't be offering service for large parties because they can't handle it.  We had a fixed menu (which is fine) but even that was kind of a challenge.  Food problems:  We started with a Caesar salad and soup. The salad was warm because it had been sitting there for so long and the soup was lukewarm.  That was followed by a couple of tacos which actually weren't bad.  I made the mistake of getting the chicken for my entree.  It looked fully cooked, but the texture and taste made it seem underdone.  Nobody at my table who had the chicken finished it.  I did snag some yucca fries and those were good.  Additionally, it took a lot of time between courses.  Drink problems:  Even though we had 40 people at our table upstairs, there wasn't a bartender for us.  Any drink orders had to be fulfilled downstairs so it was a 20 minute wait for drinks.  They did keep the water filled.  The worst thing was that I was seated directly under a bright light.  It was incredibly hot and shining directly on me and another person and our table companions joked that we would definitely confess to multiple crimes before the end of the meal.  The staff was nice and they checked twice to see if it could be turned down at all, but no dice.  Apparently, there's no way to dim a light at Chayo.    Two and a half hours later, I just wanted to get out of there and I didn't care that dessert hadn't been served.  People were getting up and walking away from the table because it was so excruciating sitting there.  Spending that much of time, sweating like a pig because I'm baking under a heat lamp, waiting forever for a drink and eating warm salad and soft chicken does not equal a favorable dining experience for me.  Like I said, the service was friendly but for a large group, this place is an epic fail.",

We shared the chicken nachos and I had the steak tacos ($18) that were probably the best I've ever had, which is a bold statement.   Plus they take really great high quality pictures of your party at dinner and put them in these cute little frames and sell them to you. $30 for two (one of the 4 of us and one of me and bae.)

    "text": "This is relatively new, at least to us but well worth trying.  It's located in the Linq plaza near the new ferris wheel.  Lots of places to eat but let hubby pick and he wanted Mexican.  It's not Mexican in the sense of the word that we normally in the US think of that type of food.  While they have tacos and typical sounding food, it's anything but typical.  We went twice while we were in Vegas, the first night by accident, the second was planned.  First night both of us had tacos.  Hubby had lobster tacos which had a deep fried batter and came with rice and beans.  He said they were really good and since there were three of them he was a happy camper.  I had grilled shrimp tacos, yummy as well.  Knew I couldn't eat all the tacos so ate one with the tortilla and the other two I ate the filling out of them.   We also got guacamole which was amazing.  It has pomegranate seeds which sounds strange but is really really good.  Many different types of margaritas yum.  One of the best I'd had lately.  Second time we went back we decided to try enchiladas.  Hubby got pork and I got sweet corn.  Even though the tortillas are smaller than what you buy in the store and I'm thinking are home made, the dishes all come with four enchiladas and neither one of us could eat all our meal, especially since we had more guacamole.  We ordered margaritas and when they came, they literally tasted horrible.  We called the server over, she tasted one and wrinkled her nose.  Apparently the bartender who made them was new and didn't know his stuff.  She went to a different bartender and got us new drinks and said she had the new bartender pour a bit in a cup so she could taste and make sure it was all it was supposed to be.  Talk about great service.",

I was called that afternoon, to make sure I was keeping my reservation.  Not sure why though, the restaurant was not super crowded.  We ordered the queso with chips for 10.00.  It was decent, nice and melty.  The chips seemed freshly fried and were crisp.  They gave us some salsa on the side for free( we were told it was going to be .50).  We ordered chicken fajitas.  I asked if we could have half steak, half chicken.  The server( Jason) said they don't do that, we could add filet for 6.00 more.  It was actually 8.00 more when the check came, but no biggy.  The portion was large, we could not even eat it all.  We had to pay an additional $3.00 for more tortillas.  I got corn( very small), my wife ordered flour.  Her order had 3 tortillas.  The fajitas came with a side of rice, beans, salsa, sour cream( big plus) and a small amount of lettuce and cheese.  Beans and rice were no big deal.  Beans tasted canned.  The chicken in the fajitas was a little spicy, smeared with a greenish paste.  The flavor was good though.  All in all a decent meal for the price.  If they would not nickle and dime you for everything, I would have given them 4 stars.",

On our way in we saw some of the food on the tables. Portions were very small. Our waitress came over, very pleasant. Told her we were there for happy hour. She took our drink order and we asked about food special for HH. She said there weren't any. So I mentioned the 20% for locals on Monday. She said we couldn't combine HH with the Locals discount. Pretty crappy. We ordered the chips and salsa for $3. Thought it was delish. Hubby had three draft beer and I had the 2/1 margueritas. The waitress was kind enough to put my second drink in a to go cup. The marguerita was good. Service was pretty slow and it was not busy. So that was a little disappointing. The decor was nice and if it was cooler outside, the patio would be nice for people watching. But I came away feeling it was a bit \"tourist trappy\". Would do HH for the margueritas, chips and salsa if I happened to be in the area but I don't see myself going back to the Linq.",

They brought me 3 regular looking tacos, for $18 and when I asked for some salsa, they looked at me like I was from Mars! Obviously they don't serve very many Hispanic's like me. I'm not sure this \"Mexican\" restaurant / bar even has a Mexican cook. Ok now that I established that the food was not worth the stop, maybe a good drink will save this place, wrong! Don't know where they found these bar tenders, but tried two drinks, didn't think you can mess up a Margaita, but just as the bland tasting tacos, the $10 drink was not good ether. So for two guest both having the taco plate, and three drinks, the bill was just about $80. I've had far better tacos off a food truck! And the free drinks in a Casino are far better! The place obviously is meant to target foreigners and must leave a bad impression on them of the way we eat in the America!",

I'd Def go back to try dinner. Ask for James.",

Never got a sorry from our waiter, but did get several from the acting manager; whoever that is...   After all the ridiculousness we got 50% off the bill and some of us didn't even get our food.

This salad was lackluster, had barely any toppings, and the toppings on the salad were devoid of flavor.  Given the plethora of food options in Vegas, I expect that restaurants should be pulling out all the stops to keep their customers happy.  I would not recommend this salad.  Their tacos did sound good, but they seem over priced for Mexican food...  SERVICE: Our waitress was amazing.  She was on point with our beverages and was very thorough on her explanations when we had questions.  Our drinks were brought out to us almost immediately.  The restaurant has a giant rooster that you can ride (similar to an electronic bull) and our waitress helped arrange it so that some of group could ride it after we finished eating.  CLEANLINESS: Everything in the restaurant was clean.    WAIT TIME: Our group went around noon and waited approximately 20 minutes for our table to be prepped (even though there were many, many empty tables).",

He was friendly and attentive but lost a point because I had to ask for water.  Sorry chad, but a responsible server should always server water with alcohol, especially with food.  Salsa with the chips is great and spicy...loved it.  We ordered tacos, one order shrimp, one order grilled fish, two orders ribeye.  Delicious!!!!!!!  However they should be for $18 each.  You get three small tacos making it $6 per taco. It came with a scoop of rice and a cup of beans. I guess I shouldn't complain about high prices since we are on the strip, but just be warned.  Overall price isn't a deal breaker since the food is worth it.  We will definitely go back if we are in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip to the strip for it.

We were seated quickly, there were 3 servers on the floor, and only three other tables at the time. We made eye contact with each server, who all smiled at us, we had our menus closed, and not a single person came over and even offered us a glass of water. After 10min of being ignored we got up and left. We had never eaten there and it doesn't look like we ever will.",

I do always ask for a water to start. I ordered the Palermo and  my husband had  Pancho Via. My drink was outstanding and made with great tequila. I think they make there own house brand. The Pancho via is jalapeno  tequila watermelon and cucumber. Of course I had to try. So refreshing! I will definitely have some of those come summer time. We had the sopes and lobster tacos. Both were very good. Great dj and as others mentioned mechanical bull. Nice environment plus they have a little lounge area and balcony upstairs. This will be great in the summer.   TIP: we parked at Cesar's forum shops valet and crossed the street. I think this might be the easiest  parking.",

The waiter explained people who live in Las Vegas know what the charge is. I said I've been a resident for over five years and never heard of it. He explained it was a franchise fee. Mmmm. He seemed to represent it was a tax. Doing some research it turns out it was just another charge to ripp off patrons. The money goes to the owners of the restaurant. They have the \"fee\" as a odd percentage to give people the impression it's a tax. The strip hotels continue to rip off tourists and that's why my spouse and I rarely go to the strip anymore.",

We finished all our guacamole and we're still waiting on our food.... for another 15 mins  I ordered the filet mignon fajitas and my husband ordered the surf and turf tacos. His came out lukewarm and mine came out nice and hot on the skillet plate. The food was delicious and had great flavor. The onions and peppers from the fajitas really brought out the flavor of the meat. Guess what happened when we were done with our meal? We waited another 20 minutes until someone came by and we asked them to get our bill.   We were originally going to the buffet at Cesar's but decided to try to save a little time and money... we didn't save either by coming here!! Lol...

This was the first stop we had in Vegas, so the prices were a little rough to take in at first, $20 for a couple tacos is a little steep, that being said it is Vegas. Overall there were a lot of menu options and the staff was helpful and friendly. I tried the house margarita and the nachos (no meat). The margarita was perfect! It was very fresh and a great taste. The nachos had a good place but were a little dry and plain, they need more salsa... queso... guacamole... something. The top chips were good but the huge mound underneath were just plain chips. Overall though this was a good experience and I recommend this place.",

The hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait, and it was, but then she asked if we minded sitting upstairs on the patio. I said we didn't mind since it was pretty cool down there, but the upstairs patio was crazy hot (it was over 100 that day) with no misters or fans and blaring music. We ended up moving inside upstairs, which was also extremely warm. All of this would have been not too big of a deal, except for the fact that there were multiple open tables downstairs (where it was pleasantly cool).   I digress. I got the chicken fajitas and they were just OK. Pretty lacking in flavor, but a decent portion. The grilled corn with a spicy mayo type mixture and cheese was easily the best part of the meal.   The service was prompt and attentive.   All in all-- it was ok, but there are too many nearby restaurants to check this one out again.",

As much as I wanted to love it more than I actually did it's not the best when expectations ain't met not by the food but by the employees. Our waiter was so nice and always making sure we were good. Now the two lady's in the front seating you were where the bad experience started first of all very rude screaming \"hu?\" Every other word I would say, now I asked my waiter if there was any possible way to get two tacos only she informed me that i could get them from their vendor outside the restaurant and bring them in or well she thought, I proceeded to do just that even thought I had ordered my aguachiles already. As I'm walking back in one of the employees (one of the lady's in the front ) tells me that I couldn't bring that and I told her I was told that I could, now I totally understand if I can't I simply can't and rules are rules. As I'm trying to explain and comprehend she is starting to become very rude and screaming at me that she's calling her manager as I'm trying to figure out where was the waiter that told me I could and also what I should do. She calls the manager I see him and I stand there with my food that I bought from the vendor outside and walks right by me when I tried talking to him and talks to my waiter, food is great like said ( aguachiles could've been spiced up a bit but personal preference)  but everything relies on costumer service. How could I enjoy my food when an employee attacks me with attitude not like I know I was doing anything wrong. Definitely was thinking of recommending this place to friends and family in Seattle but with costumer service like that never, no matter how good the food is there it's not worth being harassed Over.",

We got our appetizers before our drink order which we had to then ask again about. Someone other than our waitress brought out the food and our waitress never came back to check on us. The food was decent and good portion sizes. We also had to ask for the check since no waitress was around again. Someone from our group of 4 people asked where the restroom was and they told us to go next door to the casino since it was closer. Turns out the hostess said the bathroom was on the second floor of the restaurant and much closer. Seems like employees here do not care and need better training!",

    "text": "Had the munchies after getting off the plane and landed here, Chayo's Mexican Kitchen, located to next to the Flamingo. They had happy hour, so we took advantage of that and ordered one of everything.   The steak and chicken tacos had a lot of meat and was served with onions, cilantro, and green sauce. The wings were awesome--Coated with a chipotle hot sauce and served with a side of cilantro cream. Asada fries and cheese nachos weren't a big hit with us, but their House Blanco Margarita rocked, especially since the bartender was able to flavor it for us: one jalapeno and the other watermelon.  Great little place.",

    "text": "We went here for happy hour as they had some great deals and my mom and I just wanted a few things to share for a reasonable price. I have to say I was pretty impressed with the food and drinks. The price was wonderful too.  We ordered two steak street tacos for $5, hot chipotle sauce chicken wings with cilantro crema, which there were five decent sized wings for $5, and then cheesy nachos for $5! They also had margaritas for $5 each as well which they tasted great!!! We couldn't finish all of the food either! So for the 3 happy hour apps and 2 margaritas it was only $28.83 which included tax. I threw in $5 for a tip as the service wasn't that wonderful.  I did look at the regular menu and the prices seemed pretty pricey, but it is Vegas. Everything is pricey. I would expect their food to be really good considering their $5 happy hour apps tasted great.",

One, it was in our hotel and two, we were able to get a discount (50% off enchilada entrees) with our Vegas discount card.  *Pro-tip: If you purchase show tickets via the Ticket For Tonight stand, you'll get a vegas discount card that is good for an extensive list of restaurants!   We tried their beef tips and green chile enchiladas. Both were pretty good and had great flavor profiles. The beef tips were slightly overcooked as well as the rice, but overall it was all good. The service was okay and the food came out pretty quickly as we asked for it to be expedited to make our show on time. Not sure if I'd return for the food at full-price as I do think there are other good options at their price point ~$20 per meal, but they're worth a try if you're in the area.",

I definitely am grateful that the waiter recommended the Churro French Toast. That was definitely a life changer for me, I could eat that all day. They even add cereal and fresh berries as a topping. I didn't even need any syrup, the French Toast has the perfect balance of sweetness, I was only bummed I had to share with my table. Next time I might have to order two so I can share.  I definitely like that this is located at the Linq, I can eat till I am stuff and walk it off. I also love the outdoor patio, you can definitely enjoy the weather (if it isn't bipolar) and do some people watching if that's your thing!",

Lots of empty tables available but still waited about 45 minutes for a table.    After we were seated, the waiter asked us if anyone stated that there would be delay if about 20-30 minutes to get our food.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table, we really didn't have a choice at that point.   The food was average, drinks watered down, service slow and wait staff not attentive.    So many other choices for food so I would definitely pass on this restaurant",

    "text": "I ordered the Chicken Al Pastor.  It was dry, tasteless and offensive.  I was actually offended after eating it.  If I were starving, and you put a plate of it in front of me I would gratefully use the meat and taco shell to roll into a tight ball in which I would then plunk down a pigeon with, or similar garbage bird to then eat instead, after baiting it with the Mexican rice.  I don't normally make a big deal about a restaurant's service unless it was outrageous -- and it wasn't outrageously so I'm not even letting it negatively impact my review here -- but it wasn't good: slow to get a server at the table, ordered an appetizer that was forgotten and brought out after dinner, etc.  I cannot in good faith write a 5-star review for a sit-down Mexican restaurant that does not give you chips and salsa when you order.  That's called Taco Bell, and as a self-respecting adult, I no longer have room in my stomach for Taco Bell.  So, there's an automatic one-Star deduction off the bat.  We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer (which was forgotten and came after dinner).  It was terrible and the stale chips tasted like they came out of a bag.  Even me, a gringo, could have made my own guac better than this back in Buffalo, which is to say I would have bought it from Wegman's.  In touristy areas, with chain type restaurants and when I'm really hungry, I sometime go against the wisdom of many other Yelp reviewers, such as with this time, and I was supremely disappointed that I did.  Don't stop at the hostess stand here.... if you're intent on eating Mexican-ish food and at the Linq then walk two or three more doors down to Yardhouse instead.",

Nothing spectacular. The Michelada taste more like a bloody as if they used the bloody Mary mix. . As for the short rib flautas,that was good. The chorizo cheese dip with chips just OK. Nothing spectacular. As a Mexican Authentic restuarant, we all receive FREE chips and salsa. BUT not here you must pay,its listed in the menu as an appetizer. Just puzzling to me. I frequent many restaurants across the US and Mexico. If you want your customers to drink more, you should offer this as a freebie not charge. Ambiance during the day is not too noisey,very relaxed,great music playing n the background, very nice and cold inside the restuarant. A plus especially when its over 80degrees. I would definitely try this place at night to check out the scenery. I would recommend for large  and small parties. I would recommend thia restuarant to encourage servers to wear name badges. I couldn't address my server by name. Just food for thought. Here are my few pics for your viewing pleasure.",

It wasn't really good at all. It was dry and pretty flavorless. Even the caramel drizzle they put on it wasn't anything great. I wouldnt recommend that.  As for the service, the 1st server was pretty quick and helpful. The 2nd server was mediocre and forgot to bring my husband his condiments.

So I want to give a big appreciative thanks to the kitchen and staff for making an exception and letting us order breakfast anyway!  I ordered the Chayo Breakfast Burrito and the Orchata Mananera for my drink.  The drink is unique and would be hard to find anywhere else.  It's creamy, cinnamonny, and sweet, but the tequila and mezcal still come through a lot.  Also their micheladas are fantastic. The burrito!  The chorizo inside is abundant and excellent quality, not really greasy, and full of flavor.  The potatoes inside individually also taste excellent and great texture for a burrito.  The pickled jalepenos inside are fantastic as well.  The tortilla really stands up well to all the ingredients stuffed inside. One of my friends ordered the chilaquiles and he said it was fantastic, the way the green sauce was made is authentic and really good.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating as well.  The light fixtures inside are also pretty cool if you are into that.  Overall a great experience and glad we came here.",

The sopas was another amazing starter.  The service was great, our waiter was on top of everything.  The margaritas were perfect!!!   Chayo is an amazing restuarant and bar, the decor is festive and inviting. The outdoor patio offers a warm feeling with a beautiful firplace and bar.  The outdoor patio gives you a perfect  view of the largest ferris wheel in the world.. Chayo is the place to be!  For your after dinner entertainment the DJ and mechanical bull was so much fun!!",

    "text": "We visited Chayo during a business trip for a large trade show in Vegas this past week. The pedestrian way where Chayo is located is nicely located next to the hotel where we stayed. When you're on your feet all day, a place close by fits the bill!  We made an OpenTable reservation, and we were seated promptly around 6:45PM. Waters arrived almost immediately, and our waitress could not have been nicer or more attentive. She gave us honest and useful information regarding the drink and dinner menus. We ordered the guacamole & chips for a shared app - it had the unexpected and delicious touch of fresh pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top.  Our dinners were delicious and beautifully presented. No one had a single complaint and thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered.  The reason for giving it only three stars is based on a single thing: the noise level was so high we couldn't speak to each other across the table. The music was mostly pop, not what you'd expect in a Mexican resto. I can easily forgive that, but the base on the audio system was turned up so high that your body vibrated from it. That made for an extremely uncomfortable dining experience. I even asked our waitress if it were possible to turn down the base; she asked the manager, who said it was automatically turned up after a certain time and could do nothing about it. Really?  Had we been there at 10PM I could understand, but not only is it not a dance club, but it was what I'd consider rather early for thumper music. They had multiple business parties there at the same time, who seemed to be focused just on eating, since they couldn't talk.  Due to the noise alone, I couldn't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, I would not return unless they consider turning the base line multiple notches during the dining hours. I don't know about you, but I enjoy having a conversation with my dining companions...",

So it took 10 minutes to even get acknowledged by someone then when the hostess finally seated us we sat there for over 20 minutes waiting for a waitress to take our order didn't show up. I had to ask another waitress from the inside if she knew who our waitress was first fail. 2nd fail I ordered guacamole with pork rinds well took 15 minutes to get and they bring me chips and guacamole. After I told the waitress she began to tell me how pork rinds were not available at late night yet on the late night menu its stated on there. I was really upset why offer something then tell me no we don't.  I had 2 different waitress try to tell me this. So eventually a manager got involved an got me some but not even home made pork rinds food wasnt even worth it and the drinks that took over 30 minutes to get to us. Worst part the table next to us got their drinks and food about 10 minutes before us and they arrived bout 15 minutes after us. Horrible service overall and crappy food.",

Music playing has a set up like a lounge and its dark but not too dark, service was good, and the food was satisfying.  Chicken tacos and the shrimp fajitas were very good. The beans they servce have jalapenos in it which is different and tasted really good. Not a big fan of the riding bull in the middle of the restaurant they could probably due without that ans just stick some lounge/booths in that area instead but I guess there are peoplw that like it. My only small complaint and reason why i didnt give 5 stars is that the music was way too loud. Yes I love the music being on but not \"club loud\". I told the server it was too loud and she said she would let someone know but it didnt seem to get turned down much. I like to be able to hear myself talk and here other that im with talk while enjoying a meal. It was great music modern music but just too loud for a restaurant.  Besides that i would highly recommend this place for the food, service, and atmosphere. Just be prepared for loud music unless maybe after this review they turn it down a little.",

We got a great table on the rooftop which made for great people watching and a gorgeous ambiance, however the service on a Saturday evening was less than stellar for a place which such high prices. First, they were out of 2 of the ~8 drinks on their specialty cocktail menu. I had wanted the Senorita or the Puncho Villa based on the waiters recommendation even though they were $14 a piece, but was told after trying to order each that both were sold out so I settled for the $9 red sangria. It was small and had a very herbal after taste, so not what I expected. Second, the $25 lobster fajitas only had about 3 pieces of meat. The filet fajitas were also skimpy and had fatty pieces. The guacamole was small but good and much needed since it took so long to get our actual food. Lastly, it took about a half hour to get our check from the waiter and another 20 minutes for him to bring the card back so we could finally leave! I'd go back for a drink on the roof by the fire pit (maybe), but not for dinner. They also have a mechanical bull in the middle of the first floor but I didn't get to see it in action...",

But unfortunately, this place lacked it. We had a party of 11 and our poor waitress was left to handle our table and another table of 20+ guest on her own, while the assistant manager is busy dancing with the bull rider controller and obviously has her attention focused elsewhere, can we be more professional she is the assistant manager. As a manager of a facility she could of delegated to other staff to help provide service to both large parties. Instead a dinner that should of taken only 2 hours turned into 3.5 hrs. At that point we decided to speak to the individual in charge and he decides to laugh at another situation, goes to another customer then finally decides to attempt to address our dissatisfaction. If you don't have reservations for anything after dinner this is the place to go because you will be spending most of your Vegas time at this restaurant due to the lack of help needed to facilitate decent service. I will be sure to let everyone I know of the service that was provided at such a place in Vegas. Word of mouth is the key to any successful establishment.",

My favorite, which was something I have never had before was the cilantro cream soup- a must try if you go! Oh and I can't forget the great drinks - awesome twists on the classics!  Ambience  and vibe for a Thursday night was on point!  I really loved the decor too!  Only thing I regret is wearing a dress so I couldn't ride the bull (even though the operator said he would be easy on us).  Great place, next time you are visiting the LINQ stop by Chayo - you won't regret it!",

The burrito was nothing more than what you would get at a taco truck, and the enchilada's were all tortilla. The service was very so-so, and the bartender didn't even know how to make a coffee with Kahlua and Bailey's, yet they tried to charge it as two drinks($25)...not worth your time.",

There was a big party that was just seated so she put our food on the priority list which was awesome. We didn't have too much time because we were on our way to see a show, so we loved that we got a quick dinner with outstanding service in such a short amount of time. I got the chopped salad. The chicken was tender and the dressing was tossed perfectly. My friend got the Caesar and he said he also loved it. The chips and salsa was amazing, I couldn't stop eating. I would definitely come back and would recommend to others. Good food, good drinks, not too pricey, great environments, and awesome service!!",

It is seriously a joke because usually you can count on having pretty good dining experiences on the strip. This place does not even come close to nearby restaurants. It is just slightly above taco-bell quality \"mexican food.\" We ordered the nachos- they weren't awful but not very good. (If you want good nachos, go to Guy Fieri's !) Then we had the chicken tortilla soup... it was likr campbell's tomato soup with chicken in it ans then some tasty cheese and tortilla strips. The chopped salad... pretty tasty but nothing crazy good. Roasted corn enchiladas- inedible. Refried black beans were delicious, so I will give them that. My husband had chicken tacos and said they were \"okay.\" Service was terrible... like other than taking our order, we didn't see her at all. I saw her and had to get up and go ask her if she could bring us another round of drinks. She did, but seemed like I was really bothering her by asking. We still tipped 20% because I used to work for tips and get it, it is hard... but seriously if I tipped based on service and not just on percentage, she would not have made anything off our table.",

We were about ready to leave by the time someone greeted us at our table.  We thought they forgot about us.  We ordered tortillas which came quickly, but the rest of the meal was extremely slow.  I ordered a side of guacamole with my quesadilla, which didn't come out with everything else. I asked the person who delivered the food and he said he would check on it, but he never came back.  So we finally saw the waiter after 10-15 minutes and asked him to bring it.  He eventually brought me a small container, but by then the meal was about over.  It also took a bit of time with the check process.  The last time I went to this place I had a similar experience and we had to tell the hostess to send a waiter, so I think it's an ongoing problem here.",

    "text": "It really pains me to give Chayo 2 stars.  I was here last week with a Yelp Elite event, and all the food was great, and service was incredible.  I walked in last night ready to give Chayo 5 stars.  Based on the service and the quality of the food...I just couldn't do it. I walked up with a friend of mine to the hostess table outside...where there was no one there, also no sign indicating that there was another hostess station.  One of the servers noticed us standing there and escorted us to the hostess station, where we were told it would be a 15 minute wait.  The restaurant wasn't super busy, and there were a few open tables..but I get it, some people have reservations, some people got there before us in the time from my call and my arrival.  However...the girl at the hostess station was very unprofessional. My friend made the comment that we were told it wouldn't be a problem to get a table when we called and she said \"Well we wouldn't say that.\"  She took my name, and said we could wait at the bar.  Her attitude  left much to be desired, and really put my friend off a lot.  He was extremely upset at the fact that she was so rude.  Her choice of attire was also very unprofessional...lets just say that I could see her side tattoo and could tell that she was feeling a little chilly, if you catch my drift.   We sat at the bar, and were there a good 5 minutes before the bartender asked if we needed anything.   Shortly thereafter, the general manager, Scott, came over and asked if we were waiting for a table.   He was very polite, and sure enough...we were seated about 5 minutes later.  So the whole reason we came out here last night, was because I saw on their website that they have Taco Tuesday, which is half price tacos, and 2 for 1 margaritas.  I didn't end up drinking last night, because $14 for 2 drinks is a little spendy for me...although if the drinks are made the same as they were last week, it is SO worth it.  We ordered the chicken, lobster and ribeye tacos.  3 of each, are normally $12.   I wouldn't order these for $12.  I'll come back on a Tuesday and pay $6 for them, no problem, but they are not worth $12 for 3 smallish street tacos.  *It should be noted now, that I asked if the tacos come with any avocado or guacamole, since I am allergic.  Our server, James (who was REALLY wonderful) said no.    The wait for the food was a bit on the long side.  I'm really not an impatient person, but for street tacos...the wait shouldn't have been as long as it was.  Presentation wise, the tacos looked wonderful.  The plates have a couple slices of lime, which I thought was a nice touch...enough for all three tacos.   The lobster taco:  we got the mayo sauce on the side (my friend hates mayo)... They were good.  The lobster bites were deep fried, and you honestly had to pull a little piece of lobster away from the rest of the taco to enjoy the lobster taste, but I liked them.  I personally really liked the mayo sauce.  The ribeye taco:  Meh.  My first bite, I had a piece of fat swing out of the taco and hit me in the face.  WAY too fatty.  The second bite was better, but...meh.  Probably wouldn't eat these again. The chicken taco:  By far my favorite of the three.  The first taco was full of flavor, and really really tasty.  The second one was honestly a little more bland, like the chicken hadn't been seasoned the same way throughout.    After we finished those, we ordered the carnitas tacos.  Those took a long time too, longer than 3 tacos should have.  These were the worst of the night.  Number one...they had avocado on them, and it is NOT listed on the menu.  (I also had asked before)   Second, my friend squeezed the taco 3 times and his plate and fingers were COVERED in grease.  Ew Ew Ew.  No thank you.  The good news, and the only really stellar  part of the evening, was our server James.  First of all, we weren't even in his section, but he saw us sitting there and asked if anyone had taken care of us yet, and took our table.   He was personable, sang along with the songs that were playing, made jokes with us...and he removed the carnitas off the check with no questions asked.    I will go back, and give them another try.  I'm sure they're still in their growing and opening stages, and going through some pains.  I really want to like this place, but last night made it difficult.",

The meal comes with 3 small tacos, brown beans, white rice and a salsa verde sauce. The shredded pork had chunks of fat on it. The avocado salsa was ok and there was a spring onion on all of the tacos which I was unable to bite through.   The brown beans are basically a worse version of bushs baked beans, which I normally enjoy. They were watery.   The rice was too plain. It was cooked well but lacked any kind of flavor. I tried squeezing lime over it but still, I felt defeated.   My gf got the mahi mahi tacos of which she took one bite and said they were too dry.   The waiter was nice, however.",

They had beautiful chandaliers, a huge bar, and even a mechanical Rooster. Our server is Jordan. We had the Chayo margarita, not strong, like lemonade was tasteful. We had Tacos platter-3 shrimp tacos with rice and beans, it was $18 portion was enough for one person so it was pricey but hey its the Strip price. Then I went to  ride the Rooster not bull LOL. Just ask the waiter and he will give  you a ticket. It was a fun experience but too pricey for me.",

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars. I would. First, I tried contacting Chayo (invalid email listed on website, no response when I used the contact form on their website, and no answer when I called). We still decided to go here- why I don't know. We got there and were seated in an area that did not participate in happy hour without being given the options or told the difference between seating sections. We finally made it upstairs to happy hour. Alyssa server 1319, our waitress, took our food and drink order. The bus boy brought us 2 napkins for 4 people - not sure how that works? When our food came, 2 things were wrong (steak tacos instead of the nachos we ordered). We told the guy delivering food, and he flagged down the waitress. She became defensive from the start, and proceeded to go through our orders one by one, confirming the food was on the table, and then crumpling the receipt in front of us stating the order was complete in a very rude manner. We were all shocked at this treatment, as if we were in the wrong for not accepting wrong food. When she returned, we asked what the problem was and why we were treated as if we did something wrong. She stated that we were doubting what she wrote down for our orders, which we nicely said was not the case and we just wanted the food we ordered. She then stormed away, proceeded to throw napkins on our table, and then immediately went on break, having what appeared to be a meltdown. At this point, we were basically ignored for quite some time. Finally, a different waiter came over offering us a \"dance that we could hire.\" Apparently it was a strategy to lighten up the situation, but still no real apology. He then got an earful from us and decided to bring us shots at no cost. We asked for our checks, which surprisingly, Alyssa brought. When we paid, we were told they did not give change less than $1 and kept the change from the cash payment, basically stealing the difference that should have been given back. (Seriously - Alyssa STOLE the change!!) In the end, the food was AWFUL except for the street corn. The service was the worst I've ever had. And the compensation was not enough for the horrendous experience we had. I would highly recommend NOT going here. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants on the strip that will serve you what you ordered and with respect. Choose one of those instead. Trust me.",

The shrimp tacos and burritos got thumbs up from my friends and the guac was very good.  The drinks were yummy - especially the Qatar Elon jalapeno one.

    "text": "Went here on 03/17/14 to grab a salad before I had to head off for work at 1 PM. I wanted to eat my salad in the Yelp lounge, so the hostess told me I could order my food to-go at the bar.   I grabbed a menu and decided on the Chayo Chopped Salad for $12.95. After about 10 minutes, my salad came out. Go check out the picture, that's exactly what it looked like upon opening. I didn't ride in a car, run a marathon, or throw it in the bottom of a purse where 70% fell out of the container. I walked no more than 50 feet before opening the box. As my sister and her boyfriend said, this restaurant should be ashamed to even serve food that looks like that.  I took a bite - everything was bitter, no dressing, and it was cold, despite the grill marks in the rock-solid leek. My sister's boyfriend asked me what was with that \"rotten thing there\" gesturing at the one limp strand of cactus.   I have NEVER ever sent any food back to a kitchen before, let alone asked for a refund. But this, this was too egregious to suck up and eat the bill. I marched up to the hostess podium and said that the salad was absolutely awful and that I wanted to speak to a manager. Even the hostess had that \"ummm wow wtf\" look on her face when I showed her the salad. The manager didn't seem shocked or anything by the look of the garbage pile in the box I was holding, as if this salad wasn't a joke. She said that I could order something else, but I told her I didn't have time because I had to go to work and that I just wanted a refund which she agreed to do.  While I was waiting on my salad to come out, I couldn't help notice that the portion sizes are laughable. I'm talking maybe 10 tortilla chips with guacamole for $9. Yeah, LOLZ.",

Asked the waitress for the list and she there was none, she said \" we have over a 100\" but what they were was not known by her.    Drinks came for all and the the waitress did not remember who ordered what drink.   Same happened when the food arrived.   We were all passing plates around to the right person.    Food overall was good.   Guacamole was tasty and so were all the tacos.     We continued to drink some of the high end tequila throughout dinner.     This is where I had a bunch of tequila in me and I was irritated by this:  Check arrives and hand written on the bottom says \" suggested 20% Tip = 76.90 Thank you\".   Not happy with the note went to the manger he said sorry.    Went to the waitress and asked .. Did the restaurant as you to do this or was it your choice?    After a short dialogue she said it was her idea to write it.     We were 6 non rowdy business people.   She would have received  more then 20%.   She got less  Food Ok but service was unprofessional and not trained well.   So many places to eat in Vegas.    Don't bother with this one.",

Last time we were here hubby had lobster tacos, that he absolutely loved and raved about them to our son.  So we stopped in last Friday night so that our son could try them for himself.  The NBA playoff game was on tv, so they had all the tv's on that channel (which was awesome, because the boys wanted to watch the game), but they had the volume up really loud.  It was busy, but there were still some empty tables and no wait to get in.  We didn't see the lobster tacos on the menu, which was ok, it was probably a special the last time we were here, no big deal.  We had a waitress stop by to say she'd be right with us.  We had already been seated for around 15 minutes....we waited another 15 minutes before deciding to just get a pizza and head up to the room to watch the game there.    With it being so loud, no lobster tacos, and not really getting prompt service, it was easy for us to make the decision to leave.  We come to Vegas all the time, so we will probably give Chayo another shot, because we had such a great time the 1st time.",

We made a reservation for dinner, and right when our reservation time came, we received a call and were seated immediately. We were seated next to the small bar on the side so our server was basically right next to us the whole time.  I order a club sandwich, which was very filling. Their french fries had a little something in it that kept me from eating the whole serving even when I was too full to consume anymore. My mom ordered the chicken chayo burrito. The burrito had chicken, chayo beans, rice, and cheese with some chili sauce on top and it was very enjoyable. It was basically a spicy chicken burrito. The serving size for all their dishes would be good for two people depending on how hungry one is.   The service here is great! Everyone is very attentive even when it's not their specific table. When a server passes by, they asked if everything was okay and if we needed anything.",

    "text": "Horrible experience!   Food tasted meh. I asked about the chicken or steak burrito. The Waitress said \"chicken burrito is inconsistent it can be watery and sometimes bland.\" The steak burrito I got was full of rice, a little ground steak, some cheese, and beans. The margaritas tasted good at least.   Disgusting service! I ordered a champagne when we first sat down. I didn't get it until after my meal which took over an hour. I complained and reminded her several times. After 30 minutes of waiting for drinks my fiance asked where are drinks were. He wanted bottled corona but she didn't have it in bottles. He said dos XX in a bottle would be fine and she continued to pour him it in draft. He said no bottle! She said it's fine take this. She had a terrible attitude. I   They took the 50 cent sour creams off the check, my hour late glass of champagne, and comped us dessert which actually tasted okay. Flan tasted like cheesecake.   Bathrooms were GROSSS. Trash overflowing and NO TOILET PAPER!!   Ps. Definitely the worst place I've been in Vegas. I can't believe Linq is allowing this horrible restaurant to stay in their hotel!",

The server took forever to get our drink orders and then to come back and take our order and he was very rude.  The place was not even half full for him to lag so much.   Now to the food.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, too much spice in the food.  They came with tiny flour tortillas.  Chicken was dry as could be.  My friend ordered the tinga tostadas.  They were also completely dry and served on a fried flour tortilla.  Who the hell does that.   We had a order of chicken nachos and gorditas.  They make the tinga tostadas, nachos, and gorditas with the same type of chicken.  There is no variation in chicken seasoning.   Beyond disappointed with this place.  Will never come here again.  Next time back to what we know is good Mi Lindo Michoacan",

A big group of us went up to the \"rooftop\" and ordered 5 of everything (or at least that's what it felt like). First, the good - the food was AWESOME. The \"mini\" nachos were huge and fed our whole group of 8+ people. They were so good that we ordered another round. Then the taquitos were like something sent down from heaven - I think they were pork carnitas, super juicy and flavorful. Now the not so great... the margaritas tasted like straight up sickly sweet margarita mix, barely any tequila. I get that it's a $5 happy hour special, but if you're calling yourself a tequila bar I would hope to at least taste some tequila in there. I ended up pouring almost half of a Coronita in the margarita just to cut the sweetness. (The Coronitas were a better bet - can't really pass them up for $1.)  I'm pretty bummed we only went to this happy hour once during our stay because I definitely would go again! Highly recommended for happy hour and a fun atmosphere without being too crazy.",

Second they had NO server for us when we were seated, which they then pulled someone else to come take care of us, which was actually the only good experience, the sever Jad Saddi went out pf his way to take care of us, great service from HIM...!!! Anyway how they made it sound is that they were going to comp our first drinks, which they asked if I wanted a double, in which I said sure... Long story they charged us for the drinks... Then to the orders, a friend ordered a carne asada plate and they gave him chicken, my other friend didn't receive her food for like 20 minutes after everybody else... Which was their fault also and finally my plates serving of beans was disgusting, looked like mud, literally and was so bland and tasteless as was the rice... It looked like jail food... Manager came out and didn't even apologize and said he would take 50% of the bill and DID NOT... Only took 50% off my drinks... I am NEVER the type to complain or make a scene but this was literally the worst experience I've ever had especially for it being Las Vegas...!!! I would NOT recommend ANYONE to go to this hell hole.",

The chips and salsa were delicious.  I love spicy food so the red salsa was my favorite.  Chips were warm and seasoned.   My girlfriend and I decided to go family style and shared the chicken enchiladas and Mahi Mahi...wow. We ate our plates clean. I will say it's a little pricer than the Mexican restaurants we go to back home, but I'm sure being on the strip has something to do with it.  We will definitely be returning with friends....and we may even try the bull riding.  That's right, theres a mechanical bull and a DJ in the restaurant...Whatt?!?!? That's a good time!

    "text": "Showed up to the restaurant around 4pm and the place was not too crowded. We were sat promptly and our waiter came to get our drink request. With two other family members we ordered waters and 2 happy hour Margaritas and chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were delivered first after a few minutes. The waters did not come for another ten-fifteen minutes. Once the waters came it took another ten minutes for the Margaritas, when they arrived our order was then taken. When we received our drinks I asked for another basket of chips and cup of salsa. 15-20 minutes later we received our food. After we were done eating our entrees the request chips and salsa were brought to the table, we declined them as we were already ready to leave at this point. When the check came they attempted to charge us for the second basket of chips and salsa. I explained we would not be paying for the chips and salsa we did not take because it took until we were done eating when they arrived and we declined them. In the time it took to receive our food I noticed a couple behind us complain once that they did not receive drinks or food yet, while eating our food theirs was not delivered and they ended up leaving after complaining to the manager. Overall the food and drinks were good but the service and time it took to receive everything was just awful. Will not return to this place on my next visit.",

After waiting 20 minutes, and seeing 4 other tables being sat, I asked the hostess with no personality how much longer the wait would be. She told me she text messaged me a long time ago. That's funny, because! I never received a text. She then sat us. We waited 4 minutes for someone to greet us. Meanwhile, other servers are hanging out at the host stand. Two servers walked past our table and just looked at us. I decided to give up and just leave. I told the hostess we were leaving because this restaurant is an absolute joke. She said nothing, and simply rolled her eyes and raised he hands.  Customer service needs a bit of attention here.",

They did a great job of seating us in two tables, and giving us chips and salsa in a reasonable amount of time.  However, it took them a while to come out and take our orders and serve them.  I ordered lobster and shrimp tacos, the people around me ordered pork tacos, and one guy ordered a full salad.  Needless to say, the best deals that day were the tacos (half-priced).  My tacos were delicious, the fresh shrimp better than the battered lobster ones.  Those who ordered pork tacos said they were great.  The one who ordered the salad said it was highly overpriced for what was in it, mostly greens and blah. I think prices were touristy since this is in the Linq Plaza, so go there on Taco Tuesdays!",

We asked If it would be better if 9 of us were eating and paying for food in one section or 9 of us eat elsewhere  and none of his servers would get any money.  He could have easily assigned a table in that area to the other server to make covers even.  He huffed away and stated he what deal with it.

I'm assuming the majority of the great reviews were based on the finger foods,they were to drunk to realize the flavor of the food, or they've never had good Mexican food to understand what they had just eaten. The red sangria was amazing. The waitress was absolutely amazing, I believe her name was Alyssa, she was sweet attentive, friendly. And the gal that took over was friendly too. We had a birthday girl who was given a free bull ride, she tried to pass it on to her brother. Which it was denied. We understood because it was most likely policy but had it been allowed we would have thought the world of that particular employee and it would have probably been a way to add a great experience to the consumer. The two waitresses and two of the gentlemen helping serve, added more value to us as consumers then the employees downstairs or the restaurant itself, had it not been for them the rating would have been lower.",

They did remake them and comped them however they were still pretty unacceptable even after that fact.  Margarita pitcher was all ice but the Rita itself was good. The server was great, so accommodating however the kitchen was not. I expect strip restaurants to be pricier than off strip BUT it also should be of good or even decent quality. There is just too much competition to not deliver great food. We are local and maybe they think it's all tourists so they don't have to step up the food due to the fact that they may never return but that is just not True.  The first time we went we were not impressed the 2nd and 3rd were not by choice and I will not  return. Terrible!",

My boyfriend and I wanted to go to a different brunch spot but we're too hungry for their 45 minute wait... so we decided to try this place which was nearby. It was crowded and we were seated quickly in a booth near the back.   My boyfriend ordered bottomless mimosas (and I was able to sneak a few sips without much trouble) and I got a cup of tea. The drinks came quickly, but as soon as we ordered our waiter disappeared. We weren't able to order a second mimosa until our food arrived. Then, it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive. We went ahead and ordered a third since it was taking so long, and our waiter agreed that the bar was running slow.  I got the green omelet which was a nice blend of flavor and heat. My boyfriend got the egg scramble which he really enjoyed. The food came quickly, much faster than the drinks.",

They also participate in the cityzens app program where you can get 5 free drinks everyday for downloading that app. The bartender Rachel told me about this awesome program and I was able to share it with a few people in our group who were able to take advantage of the deal also. We ended up dropping by a few times as we were staying at the LINQ hotel and this is connected directly to the link by walking through the casino. I didn't order any food, we just would order drinks which were always delicious. My favorite was the frozen blueberry lemonade margarita.",

She asked if I needed extra tortillas but didn't tell me there was an extra charge of &3 for three very small tortillas.  Again she brought me the wrong tortillas.

The cheese sauce that was on nachos resembled a thick paste glue texture that didn't even have a taste of cheese.

Nothing more than boiled corn with a strip of mayonnaise and Parmesan cheese and some sort of red seasoning on it. Disappointing for supposed happy hour prices and a $71 tab for two people.",

Food was okay, service was literally terrible. Two of us got the classic breakfast- eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes, english muffin. Mine was fine, potatoes were good. My friends eggs were literally so undercooked it was gross, she told the server and he just stood there and looked at her until she was like sooo can they make me some new eggs or...? He barely nodded and then walked off. He came back when everyone was basically done eating with an entire new plate of breakfast, which was obviously just really unnecessary as it should have taken less than five minutes to just make her new eggs and bring them out and she could's finished her meal with everyone else instead of just ending up with a bunch of wasted food.   The breakfast burritos were actually pretty good and the guacamole was super good.   The waiter was just kind of useless. Our water glasses were empty most of the time and we really needed water, I mean come on, it was Saturday morning in Vegas. He brought a pitcher and refilled one water glass and walked away leaving the others empty before we could say anything?? Then he walked out later with two new glasses of water. Like we didn't need new glasses but ok.   I know this seems like a lot of complaining about no water, but we were dying. And he just all around sucked at everything else and it took forever. We def won't be back. Heard there are way better Mexican restaurants on the strip, so don't waste your time.",

Was phenomenal. Sometimes when you go to a restaurant and you ask the waiter his or her opinion is this good is that good is this good he was so helpful I was there with a friend of mine and we were telling us what we were thinking about and he gave us suggestions that were on the spot so perfect for us. I will absolutely return to this restaurant when Ivan F is working. When you're in Vegas on the Strip you have to go to this restaurant.",

Drinks (including water) took a while. Plenty of workers milling around, putting plates on empty tables. Some should have been helping get food out of the kitchen and bringing waters to tables.   You have to buy chips and salsa, which is lame. I understand it's a tourist area and they don't want to give things away but if you're ordering meals and drinks, chips and salsa should be provided. The chicken tostadas were good, not great. They come with a HEAPING pile of chicken which is way too much for the tostada. The steak burrito was good.   There are too many other good choices to waste your time on an ok, overpriced place. Too bad too, it's a great location with much potential.",

Ok, giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere was fun, the food we ordered was good and there is a rooster you can ride for free, but honestly we waited for everything for SO long and there were workers around.  We got here around midnight to get some drinks at the bar and an app and see if we could drink up the courage to ride the rooster.   I ordered a blue moon ($6) and my friends got their peach margarita for $14. We also ordered a round of tequila shots. Apparently their house tequila is $13 or you can get Sauza for $10- NO THANKS! We went for their house tequila and saved us a hangover.  They brought out the drinks after waiting a while and never brought any salt! I waited for someone to come over but no one came,eventually I walked to the bar and asked the one bartender if I could have a salt shaker.  We also ordered chips and salsa ($3) and their queso dip which was about $12-14 I can't remember. The chips came out after the server said he was sorry and it was supposed to come sooner, but we waited another 5-7 minutes for the queso dip. At that point we had been there for nearly 25 minutes.   We ended up riding the rooster which was fun! If you've ever wanted to ride a bull but didnt have the courage to do it in front of a large crowd, this is the place to come on Saturday night. There weren't many people around and everyone was having fun.  If the service wasn't so terrible, maybe I would come back to try their dinner.",

The margaritas were quite tasty, and I also sampled the sangria that was good also.   We ended up ordering off the late night menu and had the ribeye nachos for $19.00 and the chips and salsa for $3.00. It was a bit spendy for a late night option, but it was also very good. We left full but not stuffed, a perfect balance for soaking up the booze of the evening.",

The decor of the restaurant is very impressive and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money to every detail.  The restaurant has a great feel and is a fun place to dine.  When we arrived it was very busy but was seated immediately very close to the mechanical bull.  Although the bull was not running (i assume it starts later) you can tell it must be a center point of the restaurant/bar later on in the evening.  Everyone in my party loved the food and the presentation.  At my table people ordered the lobster tacos (recommendation of the server) and everyone loved them.  I ordered the ribeye steak that was cooked perfect and another person ordered the fajitas.  The size of the fajitas was large and he said it was full of flavor and very filling.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is around the strip that wants to try a unique experience for a mexican restaurant.  With a great location we went and walked through the linq project before heading home.",

Second ordered drinks. 2 beers for the guys, very safe bet if you are going here... I ordered a Poncho Villa which was to have spicy tequila lime juice fresh watermelon cucumber and mint, let just say poorly executed by the bartender no mint and then garnish with a crappy cherry and an orange wedge REALLY.... Taste your drinks before they go out because that one was bad, it was undrinkable.... Now to the food, wow where do I began...? We ordered Filet Steak Nachos, I would like to know what the meat was, and the chip were stale, canned cheese sauce and bad presentation... Next was the Botana Platter.... Just say NO to this... it was cold and not good looking on the plate and the meat on the dish cooked to death and to top it off dirty oil... Next up was the Tinga Chicken Tostada's. I don't know what the meat was. Was it chicken? This mystery meat was a dry and cooked to death flavorless failure... The kitchen staff should be ashamed of the food coming out of that kitchen... My note is you have a prime location, you could have some great food and cocktails coming out of that kitchen and bar it's not that hard... Being a local who enjoys coming down to the strip once in a while was very disappointed with your Restaurant...I urge you to shut your doors today and not reopen until your entire concept is re-evaluated and start over.",

We went back and talked to a man named Andrea claiming to be a manager and he said he would call us after he spoke with another manager in the morning. He never called us. My friend called several times for him and he ignored the calls.  I recommend not eating here and make sure you tally up your bill yourself. They are con artists that work at Chayo!!",

Mike has since taken over as a manager and they have done a lot of changes there. He came over and apologized for my last visit and we did have a great experience there. So j would recommend going back to this place because their food is really good and they have taken steps to improve their service. You can see my previous visit below that they made up for.   I'm not one to usually post a bad review but we come here pretty often for dinner because we really enjoy their food, but tonight was our worst experience we have had at this place. When we received our water it was served to us in plastic cups with no ice for dinner at 9:30pm. When we asked the manager she told us it was because they can't have people stealing their glassware with the night crowd. Didn't know we looked like we were going to steal anything, especially since we were sitting down for dinner and the two tables that sat down behind us got regular glassware. Then I asked for a margarita, which was served water down horribly and wit no salt which he ran off before he could even ask me if I wanted it. Then out meal came out before our table side guacamole which I server was serving himself. Not to mention he have it to us without chips or anything. I guess you are supposed to eat it with a fork. Then it took forever to find our server again just to get out of the place. Never felt so unwanted in a restaurant before. Even the manager didn't care. Stood up for her terrible server who had a terrible attitude the whole time. Sad to say it will be a while before we go there again.  Might sit at the bar next time. At least there you always have someone in front of you and they give good service.",

The pork rinds were no better than those you purchase for .99 at the gas station and my Bombay Tonic tasted very watered down. The music was a little crazy, each song was repeated about 3 times in a row.  I ordered chicken fajitas with corn tortillas and had to wait for several minutes after everyone at my table received their orders before they remembered I had ordered corn instead of flour tortillas. Once they arrived, I was surprised on how small they were.  I was impressed with the portions though.  I was only able to eat 2 before I needed a to go box and server actually took my plate to the back to box it up and brought me a bag.  The following day I decided to eat my left overs and realized that they had stuffed my corn tortillas into a tiny circular dish and all were tore in the center so no longer were useful.  I was also surprised to find the server only boxed approximately 1/4 of my plate in the to-go box.  I think that when someone pays for an entire meal and cannot finish it, the server should give all of it to you. I was not really impressed at all.",

Had to catch him before he walked off to order drinks which were underwhelming at best.  Several other tables were sat after us yet had service and food way before us,  and there was only 2 of us.  Food took over 30 mins to arrive and was cold and tasteless.  Server never checked in and was only concerned with a larger party nearby.  Working in customer service I know it can be grueling, but this was terrible.  Disappointed that we chose this place with so many other options around. Avoid this place unless you like no service at all and bland food. Unfortunately, after leaving I got very sick and had to miss a show we had tickets for. Overall a terrible experience.

    "text": "My family and I went to Vegas for NYE as usual.  This was the first time we stayed at the Linq.  Initially my mom was really impressed with the friendliness of the staff at the hotel until we came to Chayo Mexcian Kitchen.  After the ball dropped, we were starving and figured we would try Chayo since it was in our hotel.  When we got to Chayo, there was no host. We went to the bar and then to the restaurant at the back to find out if they were still serving food.  We found two helpful waiters who tracked their managers down to find out if they were still serving food.  Woohoo! We were happy when they said \"yes, just go to the front and let the hostess seat you\".  We went to the front, still there was no hostess, so we waited patiently.  While we waited another couple arrived and waited.  When the hostess finally arrived, she seated the couple before us.  I shook it off and ignored it.  When the hostess returned, I ask to be seated with my family of 3.  The hostess claimed there were no seats available and that we would have to wait. When we asked how long the wait would be she had no approximation to give us.  I asked if it would be 15 min or 1 hour and she had no idea. The place was practically empty.  When I explained that we saw plenty of seats available as we were back there already, she then claimed those were taken for reservations.  Let's be clear, it 1am after the ball dropped and people are freely walking up and down the restaurant and it still wasn't packed...who would have tables on reserve???? I've to been restaurants and clubs all over the world.  I'm from NY, live in LA and I've partied with the best.  Chayo is not the kind of club where people have tables on reserve after the ball drops on NYE.  As a matter of fact, Chayo doesn't attract that type of clientele...it was a really weird statement for the hostess to make.  Chayo seemed like decent place eat but it's no 1OAK (I did not say this to her).  From that point on, every effort that we made to get food was declined. Finally, we asked if we could get food to go and that was declined.  I just smiled and walked away because it was obvious that this woman was not willing to seat me and my family . . .maybe it was because of our skin color.  I hate pulling the race card,  but there was no other explanation as to why this woman ran the other couple back to be seated without asking them two words and then basically refused to seat us and then rambled off a string of nonsensical excuses.  Is this Mexican restaurant racist or is just this hostess? It was a horrible way to start off my New Years.  If you're a person of color and you see a red headed woman with a face full of pimples working as a hostess at Chayo just turn around and head over to O'Sheas next door.  It's not worth it to have her ruin your day.  Obviously, my mom no longer felt as welcomed as she did when we first arrived.  It's too bad Chayo left a bad taste in our mouth that taints our impression of the Linq.  We will not return to either.",

And the busboy spilled the salsa on the lady next to me and all the manager said was I'll give you 80% off your meal --unbelievable!  Good thing that didn't happen to me because I would have flipped, c'mon you ruined the lady's clothes and now has to go back to her room and change her clothes, I would have expected full compensation and another round of drinks!  Anyway, I guess they don't have to worry about providing good service because there aren't too many places to compete with at this location.",

Symptoms included fever (106 degrees) muscle aches, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms. We actually required medical treatment at the local urgent care due to the severity and duration of the symptoms. Items we ordered included the cilantro cream soup, tortilla soup, crispy fish/cilantro mayo tacos and carnitas/Mexican herbs tacos. We had not eaten anywhere else during this time period.",

And this was on a Friday nite around 7 pm----we got seated immediately, there was no waiting for a table and it didn't seem that busy.  Then, once we ordered it took a long time to even get a glass of water, much less get a margarita.  The table-side guacamole was good, but after about 6 bites for 2 people, it was gone.  We never received any chips or salsa to start us off either, which is pretty typical for a Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the chicken fajitas and the side plate of fixings was about the size of a cup saucer with a dab of guacamole and a dab of sour cream and 30 pieces of shredded lettuce---not nearly enough as fixings for fajitas.  Had to flag down the waiter several times for refills on water and another margarita.  All total, the bill was around $94 for 2 of us---not really worth it at all.  I wish I would have gone somewhere else.  Really disappointed, since the ambiance and decor were really nice and upscale.  But the food and service did not match it---at all.",

What kid doesn't love a little dessert... My daughter had the cheese quesadilla and yucca fries (steak fries)  and my son ordered off reg menu and got the ribeye tacos. He ate all three. Good sign. I had the cilantro cream soup. Had a perfect kick, really delicious. I then had the chicken enchiladas. The sauce was really good and I'm embarrassed to say I ate all of it, yikes!  Oh forgot to mention, chips and salsa were a hit! We even needed a refill in the red salsa. Service was a little slow, but maybe I expect quick service when I have kids. Definitely worth coming back for a date night. Looking forward to trying more items on the menu. Yum!",

    "text": "Not impressed at all. Service was extremely slow. Not the servers fault, though. I would say that the management was at fault here. One server for an entire area, with two tables of eight, in addition to smaller parties. While we were eating a party of at least 50 trailed in. Looks like someone unloaded a bus. For a party that big, I would say that would have been a \"special event\" and it should have been handled in a reception area. The food was okay. Very, very pricey for tacos and chips and salsa with four drinks. The bill was $160. $14 chicken tacos, and that included nothing else...just 3 small tacos. Once again, the old \"Vegas\" has given way to nothing more than tourist traps. Sorry, but Macayos would have been a better option. This \"nouveau\" Mexican cuisine is nonsense, and is made for the young, pretentious crowd that will pay \"bottle service\" at ridiculous prices and go to \"new cuisine\" restaurants to say they've been there. If you want good chicken tacos go to Faustos. This place was a disappointment, but then again so are most tourist traps.",

    "text": "Although the location and view from the second floor was great, the rest of the experience was mediocre at best. The check in process at the hostess station was very confusing and the wait was not great. Once we were seated the chips and water came quickly as well as the food. The food itself was ok, two of my three tacos were ok but the third did not actually resemble meat for some reason. My complaint is with the drinks, the wine is $10 per glass at the cheapest and the glasses are dirty and tiny. The bartender at the outside second floor bar was very inexperienced, and everyone at our table had to go up to the bar because we were not served drinks at our table. Once at the bar the wait was even longer and the bartender was not helpful and could not make all of the appropriate drinks. Once we finished eating we waited at least 30 minutes and had not seen our waiter. We asked the busser for our check and water, we did not receive our check and two of five at our table actually received water. I found a manager and explained the problem, he never apologized and took another 20 minutes to get our checks and have them all correct. Over all the food was ok, the atmosphere was nice, but the drinks are tiny and expensive and the customer service is just plain terrible!",

The young female bartender said she thought that's what I told her.  They brought them back and said my quesadilla would be out shortly.  20 mins later, well after my friend finished his tapa, they brought me a tapa.  They delivered three small chicken tacos instead.  I told the bartender again that I ordered the quesadilla.  She replied, \"those are quesadillas.\"  The couple next to us said, I thought you ordered the quesadilla?  I live in San Diego and know what a quesadilla is.  One of the two key ingredients in a quesadilla is cheese, essentially the Mexican version of a grilled cheese sandwich which is nearly impossible to screw up.  Don't let the nice atmosphere of this place draw you in.  If I were able to give no stars I would.",

The service was the worst I have experienced and the food was really disappointing. We were sat and eventually our drink orders and app order was taken; ~10 mins later our app came out (cold) and we hadn't received our waters or sangrias, plates, or table settings. So we waited longer- and finally a really nice busser brought water and table settings and apologized. Then the waitress came back and took our dinner order, which she got wrong, and when we agreed to keep it, it was awful. I was so flabbergasted by the whole experience- and shocked that no attempt was made to make up for the wrong food (at least comp the mistake; we didn't want to wait for the meals to be remade) and acknowledge that our drinks came so late (as we were starting into the mistake dinner). Overall, food and service was disappointing. Don't waste your time here when there's so many more options on the strip!!!",

    "text": "Stopped in for a late evening drink with a couple of friends while in Las Vegas this weekend. We were able to grab an open table in the bar area near the bull riding pit. We were greeted by the waitress and within 10 minutes we gave our drink order of two Lemondrop martinis and a Redbull and vodka.  After waiting approx 30 minutes for our drinks to be delivered we were served 3 shot glasses that were lemon in color. The waitress didnt say a word just dropped off the shots and walked away. We all looked at each other and really didnt understand why she dropped off 3 shots.  We figured they were comped due to the drink order taking so long.  After another 20 minutes we waved down our waitress to ask when our drinks were going to be delivered. She said \"Those are your drinks\" WTF... we explained that we ordered two martinis and a red bull vodka and she looked confused.  She then said OH yeah, I thought you meant lemon shots, and then said do you want the other drinks?  We said NO, we will cash out. They took my card and then brought out a check for 42.50. UMMMM NO,   They had run my card for someone elses bill and then took another 30 minutes to try and give me back that credit.  Then they proceeded to bring me a bill for 28.00 for the three shots???????   DONT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!  They never even apologized for their mistakes....BAD customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

My fajita plate could serve two people easily, and in my native state of Texas would have been labeled as such.

    "text": "We've been meaning to hit this place for a long time.   Please note this is for take out service and we are not scoring for appearance or the warmth of the food.  This was Sat morning and we were dying for a different type of breakfast. I get there and was greeted by a couple nice bartenders and ordered the Chiliquiles Verdes and corned beef hash skillet for me.  About 15 mins later my take out food arrives and I went to pay and I received no change back. It was about a dollar so I didn't squabble about it and just left.  I open up my corned beef hash and thought I got the wrong breakfast. The CBH looked like little diced cubes of ham. It tasted nothing nor looked like CBH. I was pretty disappointed. Not only that but instead of putting shredded cheese on top of the meal, they put it on the bottom so I had to scrape it from the box. My entire dish lacked flavor. it was probably the worst breakfast I've had in a long long time. It wasn't horrible tasting, it was just so bland. And the little cubes of ham or corned beef hash tasted like nothing. Don't expect traditional corned beef hash here.  On the other hand my wife's Chiliquiles dish was pretty tasty and good. The verde sauce had just enough spice to it. I was worried that the box and take out would make the tortilla chips soft but it came out just fine.  Pros: Not too busy but i did get there right after it opened          Friendly bartenders who take the orders          Clean restaurant  Cons: Corned beef hash tastes like ham cubes, not traditional by any means            The take out bartender assumed the tip?    Would we go back?  Yes but probably for a later night drink or dinner.",

A tad pricey, but were on the strip so you expect that. I ordered two apps to go, their chorizo queso with chips and a quesadilla.  Ordered everything, only with no veggies on the quesadilla and to add a protein, in this case chicken.  It was a little of a wait, but my server was checking on it for me. When I got the food and retreated back to my area, I was dismayed to just have a cheese quesadilla... no chicken. I specifcally needed it with a protein so that was a big disappointment.  The food itself was pretty tasty, nice crunch on the quesadilla and silky yummy queso. Next time I'd try one of their other menu items, not just the apps.",

Their margaritas are great, as is their food.  We chose two enchiladas in varieties rarely found in most Mexican restaurants.  I had the Mole Enchilada which was perfect, and my husband had the short ribs enchilada.  The service was perfect, with each of the employees doing whatever needed to be done.

    "text": "I was here with 5 other women on our last night in Vegas wanting some good mexican food before we headed home!  To start when we arrived you could see the tables and the inside of the restaurant needed some serious TLC. We were seated outside where they were blasting such loud music that we couldn't hear eachother speak. It was louder than the night clubs we had been to nights before and it was only 7PM.   It then took our waiter 15 min to come over to take our drink and food order and the first thing he said to us was how was the check going to be split. No hello, no welcome, no let me tell you about Chayo.   We didn't receive our drinks until after our apps and right before the food came out. My dish was actually good but others at the table did not have the same experience and when one of my friends questioned the waiter about her order missing items he completely dismissed her.   Once we finished our \"meh\" meals we waited 30 min to even have the waiter come back and check on us and ask him for our check. When we got our check he did not split everything up correctly (even though it seemed to be his main concern).   At that point we also heard our waiter behind us at another table where they seemed to be having similar concerns and instead of apologizing he actually told the woman to \"chill out\".   Then we he came back to us to collect our payment I personally tried to explain who was paying for what and he proceeded to call me \"baby\". As a successful woman in 2018 - that is NOT what I want to be referred to as - especially by someone who is talking down to me.  We then asked for the manager as we had enough with the situation and the manager pretty much brushed us off saying the waiter was his \"best\". If that guy was your best waiter you have bigger issues.   Overall it was a pretty poor experience in comparison to the amazing service and meals we had previous nights. I would NOT recommend this place and the waiter seriously deserved to get fired after the way he treated us and other tables.   All in all - DON'T GO HERE",

We go to Las Vegas at least twice a year & with each visit, we've gone we've longed for a place where we could dance to Latin music. Now, mind you, we don't live in LA/Cali where Vegas is a hop skip and a long drive away; this is our haven from the monotony of our respective towns that don't have active nightlife scenes.    One day we happened upon this place and it for we changed our Saturday night! We had purchased a groupon not even piecing two and two together... we stopped for a happy hour which 1) resulted in the Groupon instantly being not worth it and 2) is hardly ever heard of on the strip! A few buckets of coronitas, a marg or 2 and several apps later and we were on our way. Fast forward to 10 PM and the sounds of Selena and Daddy Yankee brought us in! I don't remember them charging a cover but that's not to say things haven't changed. The dance floor was moved upstairs the last time we stopped by and I'd be disappointed if they did away with the music! We go back just for that!",

Burrito would've been better with some sour cream or guacamole inside.  GF got the chicken tacos and the shredded meat was also extremely bland.  They also charge for chips and salsa, and don't provide any salsa for the burrito (I ended up adding a lot of Tapatio to compensate).  They then got the check wrong on top of that. Been here once before, but won't be back.",

Our server had no personality, she took 30 mins to even give us water :( She must of been having a bad day and we got the wrath of it. We had to ask another server near us for help.

We had the tacos, which were soggy and broke immediately upon picking them up. It was basically impossible to eat as we were never given silverware or napkins. After sitting there for an hour and being ignored we had to get up and search for our waiter. He gave us a check for $87.00 for our in reality $20 meal. He apologized and attempted to make this right by calling us \"babes\" and \"seniorita.\" Long story short don't waste your time and money. There are so many other great options for a Las Vegas happy hour.",

    "text": "One of the worst service and food I've had in awhile!   Came here for dinner before a night out for my cousin's bachelorette party. Our waiter, Kyle, was very friendly...only good thing that came out of that experience.  We came to the nearly empty restaurant around 9 and it took over an hour to get our food!!! You could feel the energy and excitement leave our table as we waited and waited, starving at this point. When we asked our waiter what was happening, he said the guys working the kitchen were running behind with the cooking. Behind?! There wasn't even a lot people there for it to be busy! We waited so long, my cousin (bride to be!) ended up getting sick from feeling starved. It wasn't until a friend made a complaint to our waiter, who relayed the frustration to the kitchen, that we received some chips and guacamole to try and hold us over until we received our meal. More than an hour later our food finally arrived. Too bad some of our party was either past the hunger or too full from eating chips that they couldn't eat their actually meal, and for the rest, too full from eating too fast because we were so hungry!  As for the food, I had the fish tacos and chicken nachos that was shared. The fish tacos was the worst I ever had! It was too dry, too hard, and too overcooked! No flavor at all! The chicken nachos was just okay, there wasn't anything special about them. Food all around was awful, but our party was so hungry that they just ate their dinner anyways. Also, since it was nearly midnight by the time we got our checks, it was too late to try to get food anywhere else before going out for the bachelorette party.   This was a terrible experience to begin our night out for my cousin's bachelorette, and really out a damper on everyone's mood and night.",

My wife asked for warm water for her sore throat. They came back with ice water. When we ordered lunch, my wife asked for vegetarian tacos. I asked for a tostada which the menu states comes with fries (see their menu online). The tacos come and the waitress (different than the waiter that took the order) says they are chicken. We told her we ordered vegetarian. She acted like she never heard that word in her life. The original waiter came by and she asked him and he confirmed that they were veggie. But then he said the beans have bacon in them. Why would you give someone bacon if they asked for a vegetarian meal? My meal did not come with fries, so I asked the waitress. She said that fries are extra. Then I went online and found their menu and showed her that it says comes with fries. She was perplexed so had her manager come by. I explained the situation and he said the menu was misleading (flat out wrong would have been a better phrase). So they got my wife black beans and offered us free fries. After my lunch was almost finished, the waiter came by (first and only time during the meal) and asked if we needed anything. I explained that we had not yet received the fries. He went back and finally we got them. When we got our bill, they tried to charge us for the black beans after they took away the beans with bacon. So again I told the waiter who went back and took the charge off.   Because the food tasted fine I am giving two stars instead of one. The service was horrible. Do not come here.",

So, we get in, there's a decent amount of people, there were tables all around the \"dance floor\", It looks like they just pushed dining tables to the side to make room for people to dance. There is a DJ, he played everything, from reggaeton, bachata, and salsa, towards the end of the night, he started playing corridos, that was our cue to leave.The mechanical bull is up and running if you want to ride it, but you have to take off your shoes. Bartenders are on the slow side, it took me 15 minutes to order and receive my drink, I ordered a sex on the beach, it had more juice than alcohol in it, you could barely taste it, on top of that it cost $11, I thought that was pretty hefty for a bar that literally served me juice. This is coming from a girl that's a lightweight, give me one sex on the beach and I'm usually quite tipsy. This drink did nothing.  I don't think I'll be visiting Chayo again. I didn't really enjoy my experience.",

    "text": "So my birthday happened to fall on \"National Tequila Day\" and it was a Sunday so I figured Sunday Funday at a Mexican place would be fun. My boyfriend had heard of this place so we came here with 2 of my girl friends around 4pm. They didn't have anything fun or special going on for Tequila Day, and unfortunately they didn't even have many options for margaritas. So I ordered a standard frozen strawberry margarita. It was not very good. I had the chicken nachos and they were huge and awesome! Didn't come with guacamole which was disappointing but otherwise they were really great. My bf had some fancy burger with an egg on it and he really liked it. My other friend ordered the queso dip and that was delicious. There was also a shrimp appetizer that looked a little weird. There was a mechanical bull so that was funny to watch people try to ride it. Our waitress was really nice, can't remember her name but she had tattoos and was awesome. Overall it was a decent experience, but we decided to venture elsewhere for drinks after we ate.",

(No name tag) My friend and I ask him for a water because our food was spicy, as I sat at the bar I saw him grab ONE clean glass, and one DIRTY glass covered in salt. He took both in his hand and put them under the counter, and rinsed them off, thinking I would not notice. He then proceeded to fill both the clean and dirty glass with ice and water. Then without hesitation, put them down in front of us. I was extremely grossed out. There was salt in my glass, at the bottom. WILL NEVER EAT HERE EVER AGAIN!   I am a server and I would never do this, it reflected in his tip. Extremely disappointed, this guy needs a write up or to get fired! Get rid of jerks like him!",

I yelped the restaurant selections and this only had 3 stars, people said the food wasn't good or the service was subpar; we didn't not encounter either of these issues. The hostess sat us immediately at the table we requested outside on the patio so we could watch people walk by. Christina was our server-she was on top of it, very prompt and quick with drinks and was ready if we had questions. We were there at 11 so we had the choice of either breakfast or lunch. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. My wife ordered breakfast tacos, I ordered fish tacos off the lunch menu and we ordered chips and salsa. Our margaritas came out and were delicious, perfectly salted rims. Our food came out very quickly and everything was hot right off the grill and perfectly seasoned. Of course this isn't a mom & pop Mexican joint but the food was good and Christina's service was impeccable! Would recommend to anyone, def ask to be seated in her section. We got margaritas to go and her recommendation of the peach margarita was on point. My fave drink of the entire trip!",

We tried the chicken street taco(so good), empanadas(the wife loved these), and the pork sopes(we both liked these). I tried the Buenos Dias drink, good drink to start the night off with.    I am not sure why all the negative reviews, it looks like they are from about a month ago, so maybe they had a staff change and are back running better. We had a  great time and would go back again.

The chipotle glaze gave it a spicy with a bite of sweetness on the tender rib, with a chayotes sauce  Seared Ahi Tuna (mole verde + sesame crust)- This was an interesting texture; it was chewy and tender  Pork Sopes (chorizo + queso fresco)  Churros (cinnamon sugar + cajeta)- Bite size cinnamon sugar tossed churros, accompany by a cup of chocolate sauce for dipping  Sugar Cookie Sandwich (nutella + chocolate drizzle)- Nutella spread onto 2 cruchy white sugar cookie  Flan (vanilla bean custard + caramel sauce)- The flan was delish!

    "text": "I was really disappointed by the food. I love Mexican food and have high standard so I may be biased.   Food was mediocre. Guacamole was very basic but the salsas were great. Chips seemed fresh (although I'm not positive) and likely not from a generic bag produced in mass quantities. However I hated the tortillas.  I love fresh flour tortillas that are very authentic. There isn't an option for this. We only got corn tortillas the fajitas.  The fajitas were drenched in too much sauce which is very sad because the chicken  and veggies were cooked perfectly. I wouldn't wipe enough of the sauce off. The corn was undercooked.   Service was not good and I have trouble saying this because the staff was very nice but it was too disorganized. The waiter forgot many things but was always nice when he approached so of course I figured it was just too new of a venue. Perhaps they should do mock service if they didn't bc the hostesses were very confused as well. They didn't bring any napkins or utensils and seems a little lost when I asked for it. But they were very sweet and gracious so I can't hold this against them.  I think a little more training will solve this.   I was excited to try the cocktails but the balance was wrong. My drink was too sweet. I appreciate when they can make a good drink that is balanced so just some minor adjustments are needed.   I think they have what it takes but there's a lot of work to be done. Good selection is staff but more training is needed and some works needs to be done to perfect the food.  I would give it some time before coming back.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Vegas recently and were trying to kill some time before flying back home.  I found a Groupon deal for Chayo as we were walking by trying to decide what to have for lunch.  We bought the deal and decided to go in.  We were immediately greeted and sat.  Our waitress, Christina was very friendly and so sweet.  She was attentive and personable, as well.  The deal we bought included 3 shared tacos, rice, beans, gauc and chips and 1 margarita each for $29.  I am knocking off 1 star for the food just because it was just mediocre. It wasn't the worst Mexican food I have ever had but nowhere near the best either.  For that amount, it was worth it but I just wish the food was better.  Overall, our experience was a good one but our waitress really had everything to do with that.  Thanks, Christina!",

Wasn't feeling Virgil's(manager was a tool). Wandered over to Chayo and went to the bar. Wasn't sure what I wanted, so the bartender (I think her name was Alissa) asked me my likes. Spicy being one of them, she made me their Pineapple-Habanero Margarita. Loved it. Too spicy for the wife but she liked the pineapple part, so Alissa made her a Coconut-Lime Margarita. Wife happy (not always the case). Were offered menus. Wasn't planning on eating yet, but we were enjoying the drinks and Alyssa seemed to know what she was doing, so I let her pick a couple of things out. I told I like wings but only if they're really good. She assured me is like them. I did. As well as the device she ordered for us. The BnC also ordered the hummus. Not my thing (chickpeas neither being chicks nor peas) but the wife loved it. We let Alyssa pick our next drinks, a margarita with ginger for me, and a cucumber one for her. Again, spot on choices. We wanted to keep moving, so left after those. BIG mistake. Shoulda just camped there.",

    "text": "Ugh, no thanks. To sum it up...nothing but an overpriced, glamorized Lindo Michican a local Mexican restaurant. Or for you So Cali folks, think of this place like a El Toritos.  Given that Chayo is located at the heart of Las Vegas Blvd, prices will be up the ying yang but the food quality does not match the price. NO COMPLIMENTARY chips or salsa. It's $3 per order. $9 if you want guac and chips. I know it may no biggie for some if you gotta pay for chips/salsa. This may be overlooked IF the food was good.  But it wasn't. It was bland. Three small enchiladas plate was like $18. I ordered tilapia and let me tell you....for those who are health conscientiousness, trying to watch their calorie intake, trying to watch their cholesterol....FORGET ABOUT IT. You would think tilapia is good for you but nope! They put so much salt on that fish, I thought I was going to bloat with every bite I take. Over-salted it.....what a poor decision from the chef.  I don't know what Chayo is trying to be....are they trying to be a restaurant? A bar? A nightclub-ish lounge? The reason I said that was they have such LOUD top 40s, club music playing. I was practically yelling across the table to talk to my boyfriend!!!! Before you judge me and say I'm probably too old or boring since \"loud music\" bothers me, how would you like it if you're trying to eat and you hear Pitbull telling you to \"forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room\" or Flor Rida telling you he's on an elevator and on the \"second floor...got stuck on a hoodrat...\" *rolls eyes* I'm sorry but that's not what I want to hear while trying to eat my meal. Or take the volume down a notch...or even three if they still want to continue to play that kind of music.  Service was a hot-mess that night. (Went on a Monday for dinner around mid Feb.) We had 3 different waiters/waitresses coming up to our table throughout the night. First, they can't make up their minds who was our designated waiter. We kept on getting asked for our drink orders from multiple waiters when we ordered it already. And just an observation, it seemed like none of the waiters knew which table ordered what. A couple times, different entrees and appetizers were brought to our table and it was NOT what we ordered. I saw them scurrying around trying to find out who ordered the salad. Were they ALL training that night or something? It was also a pretty windy night and even though we were sitting inside, we still felt the wind because they had the doors wide open. And common sense....wouldn't it be smart to close the doors when you see paper napkins, receipt papers and paper trash flying all around the room!? Come on now.  We left Chayo completely disappointed. I can't believe I settled on this place for dinner. -__- What a waste.",

Raechel was great and offered suggestions on what margaritas to order based on our likes. She was spot on! I had the Don margarita and the hubby had the Coconut one. His was really good and interesting while mine was way more traditional.  For our meal, I had the portobello fajitas and the hubby had the chicken quesadilla. They were both very very good and were pretty good sized portions. No free chips/salsa to start but I've noticed a lot of places getting away from this so wasn't surprised or disappointed at all. The price for the chips & salsa was super reasonable and had we not ordered such large meals, would've gotten it.  I liked that we didn't feel rushed in any way yet felt like Raechel was attentive to us. Also, the barstools were super comfy. Sounds silly but we eat at the bar at a lot of places and often the barstools are not where you want to spend a lot of time! Lots of TVs for the sports fans. And lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor area was shaded and didn't seem overly hot, even in the 108 degree heat! Didn't make it upstairs so no comments on that end.",

My salmon was served undercooked, nothing special about the rest of the food, and who doesn't put wine in their sangria? That was juice, Sprite, and a splash of triple sec, not a sangria. And to top it off, I tried to buy a Groupon a few hours before the meal that got stuck as pending so I couldn't use it. At least I got a refund there, because we won't be coming back to this place.",

The shrimp was so mushy, it was hard to tell it apart from the rice. I picked a shrimp up on my fork and it literally fell apart and landed on my plate. Food was really bland and overpriced. The margaritas were good, but for $15, you might as well spend $36 and get the huge margarita at Guy Fieri's less than a block away that's way better (and serves 3 - 4 people). I've honestly had better Mexican food at El Torito. If you're looking for good Mexican, skip this place. Not worth it.",

We sat at the bar the bartenders were great very attentive and friendly but the reason I'm giving this place one star is because of the manager or person in charge on this day. They had two TVs at the bar one playing ads and another playing the soccer game. Now the TVs are small and the one with the game was located up high so I had to look up , making my neck hurt. My boyfriend asked the bartender if we can get the game on the tv playing the ads and so he asked the person in charge that so happen to be walking by and standing right behind me she replied \"why? If it's playing right there. Why would I put the same game on both TVs ?\" She then comes around and tells my boyfriend \"I can play the game on either or but not both.\" Now I don't expect to be treated like royalty but if I'm a paying customer and I'm asking for something that you can literally do but just chose not to then we have a problem. It's not like anyone else was watching the ads or the tv. She was extremely rude and unprofessional and it was an unpleasant experience. I hope someone in charge actually reads this and calls her attention. Rule number one the customer is always right or first , something someone needs to teach her.",

I went with the sampler instead, and was happy with my choice.   Great food and atmosphere. The only downside here is that it's not in an MGM property. Otherwise great place.",

The golden margarita with patron is the bomb a little more expensive but worth it.  Now let's talk about the tacos we had shrimp, steak, chicken (nasty) don't bother, pork I picked over it, mahi mahi I kind of like,  I'm not into the whole corn taco thing could have done without.  We sent the pork tacos back after not being satisfied with the rest  but the chef said we didn't try them so he couldn't take them.   The atmosphere was nice and quiet a little dark.   That cock I rode on was hilarious, I've never done that before a very good experience.  Holding on for dear life!  I'd go back again just for the cock ride.  Oh and not once did the manager come over to see if everything was ok.",

I had the fillet mignon fajitas and they were fantastic! My husband and kids had nachos and they were pretty good. We had a giant daiquiri and it was great and had a tremendous amount of tequila. I bought a groupon for $50 for $100 worth of food and drinks, we ended up with a $5 bill, not too shabby feeding 5 of us in Vegas. I would definitely come again, service was fantastic too!",

My first thought when we walked inside was that it was a little on the loud side for a weeknight. I would get it on a Saturday night, but usually weeknights are more mellow.  We started with Chips & Salsa which were good, but are additional instead of included like most Mexican restaurants. It happened that we had come in on taco Tuesday when tacos were 50% off so we ordered tacos. We both thought our tacos were pretty good and enjoyed our meals. I also ordered a side of Mexican Street Corn which I thought was very good.   So, we liked our food, why a three star? I understand that places on the strip or in this area are going to be a little on the expensive side, but this one is too much. Even with half off taco night it was overpriced. I would only return when they are running a deal because I couldn't justify paying full price here.",

I'm sorry but I don't have the details on that. But I personally tried the gorditas - blech! The taste was very unremarkable and not what I was expecting at all. Then I had the chicken fajitas. The chicken was burnt, not charred or flavored with anything. All I could taste was burnt carbon going down my throat. Then they cranked up some dj infused rap music at around 9pm where you couldn't talk to anyone at the table. Hey, this is supposed to be a mexican restaurant. What's with the rap? A complete disaster! Ruined the evening.",

Our server took a long time to even approach our table and when she did it seemed like she was completely out of it.  She took our drink order and we asked for waters, our drinks came but we had to ask her 3 different times for water.  We ordered our food, it came out quickly which would have been great if my order wasn't completely wrong- which I told our food runner since yet again our server had disappeared.  It didn't take long for my food to come out so I wasn't too bothered by it.  When it came time to pay the bill we had separated it onto two cards and the rest cash.  I was looking at my bank statement to check my balance while we were waiting for her to come back and noticed that she had ran my card twice and had not run my friends card, which over drafted my account and charged me a fee.  We pointed this out to her and she did delete the payment but her demeanor was just completely confused.  Needless to say I was pretty disappointed seeing as I was told how great this place was.  If you work in the service industry, stay home if you are having an off day.",

Right after receiving our food our waiter came over to tell us that they will be switching waiters. Great!!!! I thought, yea no... Didn't know who it was until 35mins later when he asked if we were done. No, how was everything? Sorry I took so long.... Nothing.... So I won't be returning. It's a shame cause the hosts are nice and the music was great and that's who the 2 stars go too.",

She must have been having a horrible night.  No smiles, no friendly attitude, I don't think she even wanted to be there.  The food was just okay.  The nachos were dry, didn't have much toppings on them.  Mostly chips with a little cheese.  Horrible for $18.  The fajitas were good.  The atmosphere was fun.  It is a beautiful restaurant with lots of potential.   Lets just say I am not surprised the place was half empty.  I will not be returning.",

    "text": "What a great little place located in the new Linq area of the strip! I'm so glad we gave it a shot! This is not your typical kitschy Mexican joint. It has a cool, modern, and tastefully done Day of the Dead theme going on and is very spacious inside. The service didn't start out so hot, as it took our server a while to come to the table, but it wasn't a huge deal because it gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and she was great after her late arrival.   I was disappointed that you have to pay for a basket of chips and salsa. However, after our food came out I quickly realized that we didn't even need them. I've never seen such large portions come out of a Mexican kitchen before! This was a plus because it allowed the four of us at our table to try a good portion of everyone's selections. We had a mix of shrimp fajitas, lobster tacos, chicken enchiladas, and pulled chicken tacos. My favorites were the chicken enchiladas, which really reminded me more of soft tacos complete with avocado slices on top, and the lobster tacos that were loaded with lightly battered and fried lobster chunks. The fajitas were the only dish to come with a side, but sides are offered for $5-$8 each.  I'd love to return for my own order of those lobster tacos at some point. Until then...",

Aside from that delay^^ all else was pretty timely. The food came fast after that. Overall, it was okay. I would probably choose somewhere else next time.",

The guac isn't fresh and can't be made to order cause it's pre-made and shipped here. The fries showed up uncooked in the middle.

After about 10 minutes, another gentleman came by to tell us that he would get a server. After about 15 more minutes, I asked for the manager. She told me that they were short on servers for the shift.  I work in a restaurant, I know what that's like. But if a table was sitting there for 20-25 minutes, and didn't have a server or menus, and the only person to help was a busser/expo (sorry, I don't know what his job title was), I would say that it was a very, very, very poorly run restaurant. And if the servers were short handed, the manager SHOULD be the one to help pick up the slack, not be standing by the p.o.s. system asking me what I want to drink when I tell her I've been waiting for 25 minutes for a menu.   Needless to say, I left. The food might be good.",

    "text": "Another place on the strip...another place that's over priced and maybe not worth it.   Came here with a group of friends last weekend. Everything was good, service was good, but good god...they charge a lot for everything. Especially their drinks that have hardly any alcohol. (Ironically, the name has \"Tequila Bar\" in it.)  The patio downstairs and upstairs is very nice. I can see why people would want that with the Linq to look at. They also have a bull to ride on, and you know some drunk ladies love some bull riding...  I give this place a solid 3 stars. Good food, good service, clean, but for the prices, I think it should be a little better in all areas except the decor. The decor is very nice and they want it to seem upscale. They're just lacking with quality.   The margaritas were very sweet with little tequila. I ordered one that was supposed to be more tart. I had the carnitas and they were good, and good if you're not very hungry. Most of their food is smaller portions. I almost always get carnitas when I eat at Mexican restaurants.  The lobster tacos were okay - they were a bit too salty for me. One thing I really did enjoy was the guac. That was some good guac.   Over all, we had 4 margaritas, carnita tacos, lobster tacos and guac - it was $120 with tip. I don't think it's worth this price. But, whatevs. It was good enough and we all had a good time.",

The disappointing  - Took forever to get a server at our table, we had to flag them down after 2 water refills.  - see salt comment above  - entrees are laughable small, they arrived and we ordered another appetizer for the table. Tapas sizing, entree pricing. Definitely not good value.  - additional appetizer never arrived, it was apparently delivered to the table next to us. Server tried to convince us to order more. Check please!   I realize we're on the strip, however, most places even at strip prices offer good value for the amount of food. This place, nope, nada, niet, nee, non...   If this was the last place to eat on the strip, I would probably choose to starve.   My recommendation, have reservations, serious reservations about eating here and go elsewhere.

Plus the ambiance is really nice and clean. But If only I could give negative feedback about the server I would, and I wish there's separate ratings for food and servers.   Our server was the black haired Latina, didn't get her name because we were just gonna let her attitude go. Anyway, she was so rude and pushy with us ordering alcohol, we didn't want any but still kept pushing. And when I asked if I can have options with the drink that I got, she just got too bjtchy. She was acting too cool and not even treating us like her customers. Me and my friends thought that she didn't deserve any tip because of her attitude and bad service but we still left $3.   Leaving the restaurant, she chased us with a really bitchy attitude. \"You're gonna give that much tip, for that much amount of food? So did you wanna get your change back???? Is my service really that bad?\" Said that very rudely. So my friend ended up giving her $10 so she could just leave and go. Ughhh, most terrible service I've had in my life . I really can't believe her. I even called the manager about her.   I feel bad for this restaurant for having her. She deserves to get fired and just quit and have a different job that she actually like and hoping she could read this and realize how bad her service is.",

We sat at the bar seating section, and it took about 8 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us, no menus were ever provided but I ordered a margarita and an order of guacamole. After 10minutes, I still had no drink so I got up and went to the bartender since all the other tables had their drinks. She made one but it tasted like syrup and zero alcohol. 25 minutes later, after every other table had full entree orders, still no guacamole. I said something to the waitress and she said she put the order in but after another 5 minutes, still no appetizer. She gave a free* order of nachos to a random table because the group before them got tired of waiting and left. Finally after 35 minutes, I canceled my order and paid for a drink that I threw away because it was a disgusting. I asked for the manager but he said he just got there and had no idea what was going on. Bad drinks, horrible service and never got food-- BUYER BEWARE!!!!!",

As soon as I saw it was Mexican breakfast, I was immediately sold.   Because it was our first morning and Vegas is a marathon not a sprint, we decided to each have a cocktail and split breakfast. I ordered their Michelada which was a perfect combination of spicy, salty, bubbly goodness and my boyfriend tried his first Tequila Sunrise. For breakfast we went with one of my favorites, chiliquiles. Now my gauge for a good order of chiliquiles is are the chips still crispy, is the salsa tangy and warm, and is the egg soft? Sure my standards are specific but I'm a chiliquiles enthusiast, k? Not only were all of my standards achieved, this breakfast ended up being a perfect beginning to our first day and set the bar pretty high for food for the rest of the trip.   If you want some delicious Mexican breakfast without having to leave the strip, this is your spot, amigo.",

    "text": "I cannot pass up the chance to try a Mexican restaurant so Chayo was obviously on my radar from the moment I checked in at the Linq Hotel & Casino. I came in for dinner on a Tuesday evening and it was surprisingly busy, the hostess told me there would be a 35 minute wait for a table or I could seat myself at the bar. I was dining alone and went with this option, I still had to wait 5 minutes for a seat because they were all taken but it didn't bother me.  I was a little annoyed about one of the staff members, a blonde bartender with tattoos, who wouldn't serve me as she said she was too busy and I would need to go stand and order from her coworker on the other side of the bar from where I was standing. Not only this but my entire dining experience was interrupted by her complaining to her coworkers non stop about one of the bar backs- her customer service definitely needs some improvement. I digress...  When I finally managed to get served my bartender was awesome! He made me a delicious and strong Cucumber Margarita and took my order really quickly. I had the Guacamole and the Short Rib Enchiladas. Guac was really good and the enchiladas were decent too although I thought the sauce could have been a touch more flavourful. Overall I had a positive experience but might be hesitant to sit at the bar again, I don't want to hear about how much the staff don't like each other/are annoyed with each other while I'm trying to relax and have some delicious food and drinks. Will definitely come back again the next time I am in Vegas.",

Not a huge disappointment, but not a restaurant we'll return to. Food was okay - a bit expensive - and we had to purchase chips and salsa. Margaritas were expensive - good but costly. We'll gladly travel the distance to Restaurant Linda Michoacan in the future.",

The area is a bit cooler and they have music going on outside and lots of TV's with all the games on inside, which makes it a nice place to hangout. Their happy hour is on the rooftop from 2-6pm.  The service was great while we were there, our waitress checked on us several times and made sure we were plenty hydrated.  Make sure and walk around the promenade afterwards, there is plenty to see and do!",

I'm sorry, next time if you do not know about that do not pretend you do and act like it is my fault.   The food was very good! I got vegan tacos and some guac and chips for the table.

I asked to sit where we could see the baseball game so she brought us to a bath that had 4 TVs showing the game. We were quickly brought water and ordered a pitcher of margaritas and chips and salsa.  The margaritas were great. A great balance between tequila and sweetness. The chips and salsa were tasty. The salsa wasn't too spicy. We placed our order of a pork Chile verde burrito, avocado chopped chicken salad, tortilla soup, appetizer sampler and, an enchilada.  It all came out surprisingly fast. The burrito was good definitely spicy though. It was also huge. I was splitting it with other people so it worked out really well. The salad was my favorite. It was fresh and well balanced with all the ingredients and combined with the burrito was a good idea. The tortilla soup wasn't what I would have expected. I think they blended it up so it was creamy. The bites I had of it were super good though.  The others I didn't try but from what everyone said they were good too.  The service was great. Our server was always making sure we had everything we needed, but he wasn't overly intrusive.",

The carne asada scramble seemed like a great option, and the server even touted that this was their most popular breakfast option... upon the first taste of the carne asada, I thought I was eating beef jerky with my eggs. Seriously... blind taste test and you'd never know the difference. The potatoes it came with were average at best, nothing you'd expect from Vegas, as if I were shot through a portal and landed in iHop. Thankfully, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and I won't have to think about or see this disgrace to Mexican culture and food ever again.",

Then when my boyfriend and I ordered our drinks, the waitress didn't take our other friend's order. When she finally came back, we ordered our food. My friend's husband asked if he could order his burrito chimichanga style and she said yes. She finished taking everyone's order and it took over 30 minutes to get the food. While we were waiting, the manager came over to ask how everything was...odd because there was clearly no food on the table, so that entire interaction was strange. When we finally got our food, the burrito my friend's husband ordered wad enchilada style. When he asked about it, the waitress lied and said sure didn't know he wanted it that way and walked off. She came back about 10 minutes later and offered to fix it. Then she came back Amy's said they actually don't make burritos chimichanga style, gave the food back, and walked away. We did not see her again until we asked for our checks. As far as the food goes, it was ok. Nothing to right home about. We had guacamole, queso, taquitos, nachos, that not chimichangas style burrito, and enchiladas and a red sauce so spicy you could breathe fire.",

    "text": "Pay cash if you dare to go here, because they tried to steal my friend's credit card. BLATANTLY. Take the time to read this trust me.   We were there a couple of weeks ago on business, visiting from out of state. We got there for breakfast about 9 am, and we're done eating around 10am. The food was ok. We had no alcohol, so it's not like we were unaware of what was happening. My friend had went to the restroom while they were running our card to pay for the meal. While he was gone, the manager, Chris, came by with the receipt and asked me several questions that caught me off guard (distracting me) about who I was and what we had just ordered. My friend came back and signed, without realizing they didn't put the credit card back in the holder.   By the time we had walked a few blocks down the strip, he realized it was missing. We immediately called Chayo. I explained calmly what happened, and they put me on hold to speak to the manager. The same girl picked up the phone, and said they didn't see our card. It was only about 30 seconds, so they clearly didn't even look. I asked if she could ask our server if he accidentally left it somewhere or \"accidentally\" put it in his pocket. They had conveniently \"sent him home for the day\"... weird. It's 10 in the morning and you're done working for the day? When I asked for them to call him, we were told he doesn't have a cell phone... really??   We tell them we're coming back, because we hadn't gone anywhere else and we knew it was there somewhere. As it was clear they made zero effort to even make it seem like they were looking for our card, several other suspicious responses were given, so we were very alarmed and put a hold on the credit card immediately.  We called back and got the manager on the phone finally. He began dropping f-bombs for no reason to my friend, swearing they didn't have our f****** credit card. We told him we were bringing back a police officer and hung up.   As we were about a minute away and had already spoke to a cop, we brought a security guard with us that was kind enough to assist us when we explained what happened. We received a phone call back from the manager (Chris) who said \"I found your f****** card in the trash and was I tempted to not call you back\"... WHAT?? Eh.. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?  We had done nothing wrong, nothing to deserve this behavior. The security guard wisely instructed us to stay calm and just get the card back, then deal with it above his head later. Hi Chris! :) There's no telling what he lied to his boss about this whole situation...  So anyways, when we showed up, Chris the manager came out, handed us our (now cancelled credit card, which messed up our trip, as well as many other business expenses by the way). He then had the AUDACITY to tell us we were banned from the restaurant and to never contact them again. LOL. As if we would EVER want to eat there again after this happened. He doesn't want us around anymore because he was caught.   So to recap, we ate at Chayo, they \"threw our credit card in the trash\" and we aren't welcome to eat at this extremely poorly managed restaurant anymore. That's just too bad, seeing as there are only a couple of places to eat in Las Vegas..... WHAT. A. JOKE.  I'm mainly writing this review to warn other guests, and warn Caesars entertainment that they need to look into this for clearly attempted credit card theft. There should be no scenario where you give a restaurant your credit card and they throw it in the trash after running it. So either somehow that happened, or it was in Chris's pocket and he panicked when we weren't going to leave it alone and told him we were coming back. I'm thinking it was in Chris's pocket.   Chris should be fired for the way he talked to my friend ALONE!!!! For the way he handled the situation, and none the less trying to steal our credit card and then lying to our faces about it. Extremely inappropriate and unnecessary.   My friend has already been in touch with someone at Caesars Entertainment because they own Chayo's. I just wanted to make sure something is done here. We would have filed a police report if we were in town long enough to do so. That's how certain we are that he is a criminal. I'm sure we reacted like anyone else would have if their credit card had gone missing and we knew where it was.   Fire your \"manager\" Chris, Caesars and I guarantee the customer service satisfaction will improve. Do it before he tries this with someone else.",

You could not see the shrimp for the abundance of tomatoes.  The shrimp pieces were small and I doubt they constituted even 3 ounces of meat.  The shrimp diablo somehow turned into shrimp fajitas, but they were blah overall.  The filet mignon fajitas were also average at best.  The meat was overcooked and had some gristle in it.

    "text": "I happened to buy a groupon for Chayo Mexican kitchen-last minute, we were already on the linQ promenade and my friend wasn't feeling well.  I found this 50$ for 100$ worth of food. Before I go on with my resto review: I want to commend the management here. In general, you have to wait 24 hrs after purchase before using a groupon voucher. We asked if we could use it within hour of purchase and the manager, Brandon, agreed. I was so happy. He also ensured to drop by regularly to see that my friends and I were happy with the service and food. We got free whiskey shots, which was very thoughtful.  There was a cool terrace outside but because it was cold we asked to be  seated inside. The venue was very large and had a neat fake bull to ride in the center. It was entertaining to watch people bull ride, especially during the local rodeo.   Food: For appetizers we ordered the guacamole and chips (4/5)- the guac was very smooth and creamy and was a decent portion to share with all; chipotle wings (3/5) these were spicy! no joke when a title reads chipotle you better like a kick for an aftertaste. We ordered a pitcher of their lime margerita which was delicious. Four our main course: we had the portbello mushroom and filet mignon fajitas (5/5) They came with 3 warmly wrapped tortillas, mexican rice, and sides to garnish. Both were very filling. Unfortunately, I had no room for dessert!  It's nice to see a business that is so accommodating to their clients, makes the trip on the strip all the more worthwhile. 5 stars.",

    "text": "With so many options on the Linq promenade it can be hard to decide what your taste buds are craving. If a South of the border dish is what you're looking for I would recommend you go inside the Linq to Chayo.  First off, very spacious. Good amount of distance between tables so you aren't cramped or back to back with other people. The decor is pretty dope. I love sugar skulls, and they had an entire wall of them. Sorry, I was so into my food I forgot to snap a pic. Right smack dab in the middle is a mechanical bull. I didn't ride it (didn't have enough tequila while I was there), so I'm not sure if it's free or not.  Our server was very friendly. Providing us updates when our food and drinks were taking longer than usual. The food was tasty. Mexican with a Vegas twist. We started with the ceviche and it was good, but a little heavy on the chip seasoning for my taste. Borderline too salty. The Chicken Al Pastor tacos we're seasoned to perfection. Deconstructed so you can build them how you please. Bubs's chicken burrito was kind of bland, and our friend's enchiladas were pretty spicy. For casual dining it's mid-range pricing ($15+ a plate), but the portions were a good size.  Don't feel like dining in? Chayo has a food cart on the promenade that sells smaller portions of select items from the main menu.",

We had to wait for our table for a few minutes and were seated in the middle of the restaurant. It was a high table with tall chairs.   The restaurant is like sports bar of sorts with tvs hanging from the walls. The menu is not too adventurous but the portion sizes are huge. We ordered an assortment of appetizers, main dishes and desserts.   The burritos were nice and tasty and massive. Not that flavorful. Everyone agreed that the main dishes were pretty bland. No worrying about the spice level as nothing was remotely spicy.   The desserts - which again were very big - were probably the best part of the meal. They were plated very nicely and tasted great.   For a group of 10 we spent around $280. For the expense the food was not worth it - but maybe for a special occasion paired with visiting the High Roller it could make for a good outing.",

Their draft beer selection was very limited, I ended up getting a beer that was absolutely horrible, tasted like it had gone bad! That was my fault though, I should've paid more attention to the bar tender!! The food came, and it was very mediocre, coming from Southern California, I've had some of the best Mexican dishes that are out there, and this place did absolutely no justice! The presentation was nice, but their wasn't really any flavor or taste to the food! Other than that, the staff was really nice, and seating was pretty easy!

They were stuffed with shredded chicken but so much so you couldn't enjoy the other ingredients. The meat also had no taste. It wasn't seasoned well at all and for a Mexican restaurant that's disappointing. My boyfriend had the enchiladas and had the same problem. Solution here - less unseasoned meat and more fresh ingredients.",

Chayo would have gotten 4 stars except that the server didn't recommend or tell us about the specials for Tuesday. After I brought it up he said \"Oh, I forgot it was Tuesday. Sorry, I live in Vegas and I never know what day it is?\" I thought I'm a local, I know what day it is and funny you knew you had to show up to work today?!\" Why don't you be honest and tell us you didn't want us to order the 1/2 off tacos or margarita  because you want a higher check average. Besides the server experience, the food was tasty. We enjoyed the rib eye tacos and lobster tacos.  But before we enjoyed the tasty tacos we enjoyed the yummy shrimp ceviche with pork grinds. It was really good.  I never thought about eating ceviche with pork grinds.  We ended the night with the tres leches. I had better but it was pretty good to fulfill my craving for tres leches. Fun atmosphere for date night or night with friends.  The place would gave gotten 4 stars if the server was honest from the beginning.",

The only issue was the initial service.  The restaurant wasn't busy at 6pm , and we were seated inside promptly with menus  Then we proceeded to wait for like 15 mins. Waiters passed by....no acknowledgement.  Finally we flagged someone and asked if we had a waiter.  A waiter or busboy said he'd get someone.  Another 5-6 minutes and our waiter appears.  We mentioned the wait and she apologized but was like \"Oh, I don't know anything about that.  They just told me to come over here.\"   It's True,  she hadn't been one of the many waiters who'd passed us by so I guess they did just pluck her out of the blue.  Plus, she was super nice and the service was very good after that,  It just made us wonder---is this usual Vegas service?  Cuz right after Chayo, we went to Serendipity for dessert and had the SAME problem.  Hmm.  Very strange.",

Fine either way but owners should make it one or the other   Food is nothing to write home about. Fish tacos were greasy and carnitas had chunks of fat in them. Salsa and ceviche were very good.   Speaking of salsa. If you want it you have to pay for it. What decent Mexican restaurant out there charges for chips and salsa?  Beans and rice are also a la carte and are not included with your meal.   If you are looking for a fun loud nightclub I recommend this place. Don't go there expecting a memorable dining experience.",

The restaurant itself was maybe 1/3 full so we got a table very quick. Afterwards the server was quickly with us asking if we wanted anything to drink. The service was great. The food was delicious as well. Keep in mind that this isn't meant to be a full authentic Mexican restaurant so I wasn't expecting that but either way the food was good. A nice little detail was that the sous chef came out to greet us and have us free shrimp tacos which were delicious. He came by a few more times after that to talk with us.

If you have a large group - avoid at all costs - and even if you are small group - best to just go for happy hour (fuel up on cheap drink) then head somewhere else for dinner.  Food is more \"hot\" with no flavor.  So very sad to have to write this review - was hoping for a better experience.",

Walked through the crowded restaurant to the hostess stand which is inside the Linq.  The hostess told us we just missed \"dinner\" and could eat off the lighter menu which of course was very limited and did not have fajitas.  She then asked me what I was in the mood for and I told her fajitas.  To add insult to injury she told me flamingo was right next door and I could find a restaurant there.  My next question was what time they stopped serving dinner and the response was 10:00pm.  So needless to say I did not get fajitas because of the 2 minutes it took me to walk through the restaurant.  This could have been handled so much better and I will never be back!",

It was deep fried lobster topped with chipotle sauce, purple cabbage. It was pretty crispy and delicious although I would have preferred the non fried. My boyfriend got the Torta and felt everything was pretty soggy. It came with shredded chicken, purple onion, and slices of avocado. The side was a small salad with a creamy dressing. We sat outside and the whole area was covered with umbrellas so it was nice and cool in the July weather. Restrooms are upstairs but don't worry they also have an elevator you can use to get up there if needed. They also have an upstairs area with dinning, patio, and a bar. Downstairs in the center they do have an electronic bull to get your ride on or be entertained by those who challenge the bull. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and just there, he came, he went, we left. Food was great and we will be back! Oh and you get the High roller view!",

    "text": "I'd take a pretty hard pass on Chayo Mexican Kitchen.  The location is great - the Linq Promenade...  but the food and experience is just not good.    I found a solid deal on Groupon - $50 for $100 worth of food and drinks...  I got it for around $40 with an extra discount.  As this was a trip with my brother and his family, I was looking for more casual, interesting restaurants close to our hotel and this definitely seemed to fit the bill.    Since it's on the Promenade and we went on our first night in Vegas (and my brother's first trip to Vegas ever), we wanted to sit on the patio to do some people watching and take in the scene...  it was a little chilly but there were heat lamps all over the patio area so I thought -this will be fine, right?  As it turns out, NOT ONE of the heat lamps was working.  Or maybe it was a case that no one knew how to turn them on?  Whatever...  it was odd.  If they don't work, fix 'em.  Or take 'em out.  They kept fiddling with them but it was clear they either don't work or no one knew what they were doing and we were too far into the meal to move.  Layering.  Always the way in SoCal or Vegas.    Since we had the $100 to spend, we started with Margaritas and Sangrias.  As you'd expect, they have a lot of options and the drinks were probably the best thing we had here.    The Queso dip appetizer was ok.  Melted cheese is easy and generally good.  The chicken fajitas were $22 and covered in an odd green sauce.  It looked like \"pesto fajitas\".   The chicken was dry and tasteless despite the sauce (whatever it was).    My Three-Cheese Quesadilla was OK...  again, melted cheese is a good thing.  But though topped with roasted chiles, a cilantro crema and pickled vegetables, the entire thing really just tasted like bland cheese between tortillas...  no punch or flavor at all.  I ordered a side of guacamole to go along and it tasted like the sort you buy at the Ralph's in the refrigerator case.  I don't believe it was fresh or housemade.  A side order of street corn was also strangely flavorless.  Seasoning is just not a thing here..  you won't find any discernable Mexican flavors or spice.    For dessert, we shared a Brownie Sundae.  It was pretty on the plate and was as advertised - a brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Not the worst.    Service was disjointed and not particularly attentive.  Questions weren't answered.  There seemed to be a general lack of knowledge about the menu and the entire operation...  maybe everyone is new?    Not gonna lie - having that Groupon made this whole disappointing meal a lot easier to swallow (ha!).  If you are staying at the Flamingo or the Linq, it may be worth it to buy the Groupon if (and ONLY IF) you use Chayo as a stop for drinks and apps...  but making this one of your meals is just going to leave you unsatisfied.  Skip for dinner.  A soft \"maybe\" for drinks.  Bring a sweater.",

I had an issue with my steak! They took care of me without any questions. Actually came back and gave me a whole other full plate of breakfast.   They know how to treat their consumers. I would tell everyone I know who's headed to Vegas to please go by and eat here. The home fries were the best home fries I ever had. Well seasoned and the steak ... I need another one! I may go by tomorrow and eat there again.   Go support this business",

I went to the house it showed on the map and GUESS WHO CAME TO THE DOOR.    That exact same bouncer. Acting like he was doing me a solid.   So - feel free to check this place out.

We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. They brought wrong drink but we didn't mind so much. Then we ordered guacamole as an appetizer; it came with cheese on top which my husband doesn't eat and they immediately noticed us picking it off and offered to bring a fresh order and more chips in addition to the original order. Extra guac for free?? Unheard of!  Our orders took a little longer to come out and while we waited we were entertained by a group of friends competing on the mechanical bull. There was loud music playing but we were still easily able to talk and hear each other. The walls were decorated with colorful sculls and crosses.   I ordered the shrimp burrito, and sadly I was disappointed. I don't feel that the beans went with the shrimp and it could have used a white sauce instead of green. The flavor ended up being a bit bland, and there could have been more shrimp.   Overall I was very pleased with the friendly service and experience m, but the food could definitely be improved.",

    "text": "BEWARE!!!!!Just received the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life.  The general manager and all of his associates threatened to cause us physical harm when we requested the server be changed. The person who was brining our our food has physical deformities with his hands which of course we had absolutely no problem with. The issue we had him was that he was touching the food with his bare hands while he was placing it on our table. He was cleaning garbage then using those same unwashed hands to serve our food. We then requested to our waitress that a different person bring our food as we didn't want the same person touching our food after cleaning. That's when things got ugly. We started getting harassed by the entire staff that we are racist? That we don't want him serving us because he's physically deformed? WHAT!! Are you kidding me? That's absolutely not the case whatsoever!  We then asked the manager to come out because at this point we did not feel comfortable to continue eating our food. It took him 18 mins for him to come to our table and when he did he yelled at us to get the f*** up and leave. Thank God I took out my video camera to record as you can see posted.",

We looked everywhere for a brunch place that wasn't over priced, far away or a long wait. We found this place and it exceeded expectations. It had VERY reasonable prices, no wait, AMAZING service (waiter George the bartender), and the food was incredible. Bottomless mimosas for $20?! What?! Honestly, get the Huevos Rancheros and you will NOT be disappointed. The ambiance was dim and sultry which I loved -- I am definitely coming back for happy hour tonight.

The service is also so so. They were good about filling waters, but that wraps it up. And the place was empty...  I would skip this place.",

Honestly, I just wanted to get drunk from pina coladas, have a bean and cheese burrito and ride the mechanical bull. I successfully pulled off getting drunk on pina coladas so there's that.   To sum it up, I'd skip the food and go straight to their bar. If you want a great drink come here.",

The margaritas are pretty good, the guacamole is enjoyable if a little pricey, and the steak nachos are tasty but so massive even two people will struggle to stuff them all in their pie hole.   Service was weird, we asked for an inside table because temps were dropping quickly outside and I didn't want to freeze. The hostess made a big deal of checking to see if they had a table but sure enough the patio was mostly full but the inside was a ghost town. Maybe they wanted everyone to sit on the patio so they'll seem busier?  Oh and they have a mechanical bull that you're free to ride after signing about 50 waivers! There's no charge and your fellow patrons will appreciate the entertainment!   I'd come back here if I was in the area and wanted nachos but you're not missing much besides some possible mechanical bull entertainment if you mosey elsewhere.",

    "text": "A bewildering experience at best.  Zumba music, good Mexican food & terrible drinks.  Let me explain.  A great location for people watching (if you sit on the outdoor patio backing onto The Linq Promenade), Chayo Mexican Kitchen & Tequila Bar is located on The Linq Promenade between The Linq & The Flamingo on The Las Vegas Strip.  Commonly known as a tourist trap, Chayo Mexican Kitchen & Tequila Bar is slightly over-priced, with perhaps the worst mixed drinks in the history of Mexican restaurants.  We ordered The Key Lime Mojito ($13) & the House Margarita with Anejo Tequila ($13).  The Key Lime Mojito tasted like 7-Up.  No alcohol, mint, sugar cane, etc.  The House Margarita with Anejo Tasted like lime extract that you squeezed out of a plastic lime that you purchased at the supermarket. Again, no alcohol taste whatsoever.  For food we ordered chips & salsa ($5.95), the green enchiladas\" ($19.95) & \"the chicken burrito\" ($18.95).  The chips & salsa were what one would expect at a Mexican restaurant (usually provided free of charge).  The meals both featured large portions & both were tasty & good to eat. Not the best enchilada ever, not the best burrito ever, but good for the Las Vegas Strip.  Total price of the meal was $70.85 + $9.45 in taxes, for a grand total of $80.30 before tipping.  On a scale of 1 to 5, where one is terrible and five is excellent, I give Chayo Mexican Kitchen  & Tequila Bar a 2.5.",

    "text": "We stopped in here for happy hour since it was right in our hotel. I saw the less than stellar reviews, but figured drinks couldn't hurt. We decided to sit at the bar and I'm so glad we did. The bartenders were super friendly and chatted with us the whole time - they're actually the only reason I gave the place an extra star.  The hh margarita (without added flavor) was just ok, the added flavors were better (the watermelon was actually squeezed watermelon, not just flavoring), but still not great. The hh beer came in mini bottles. At the end of the hh, we decided to order a couple apps because we kept seeing food go by and it smelled great. My bf got the wings which were just ok, but came with a cilantro cream sauce we both really loved despite the fact we both typically hate cilantro. I got two tacos, one chicken and one steak. The steak was pretty horrible, but I stole my bf's sauce from his wings and it made it tolerable. The chicken was actually really good and tasted authentic.  While the bartenders were super friendly to us, the service in general for the hh was a little crazy. It seemed there was one dedicated bartender and one dedicated server (until the last hour of the hh maybe), but one guy was more of a floater and didn't really seem to help where needed. I watched pretty much every table that came in sit for a long period of time and sit and talk amongst themselves, shaking their heads in disbelief that they weren't being served. I watched people sit with empty glasses for long periods of time with no refills. I watched people sitting with their checks annoyed because they wanted to leave. Many people came up to the bar to get their own refills and pay their tabs. I feel like they likely lost a lot of sales during the couple hours we were in there because people either didn't get to order often or just got sick of being overlooked and left.",

Definitely try the empanadas, they are delicious! The guac and the salad are also tasty. The pork enchiladas are delicious and come with tasty pickled veggies that make the dish. A definite must try!",

Turns out, the bats actually descended from within the loins of the hostess. After descending from her upside down perch which was allegedly the hostess stand, she tried to steal our drinks which we had just recently acquired from the fine Irish drinking hole next door named O'Sheas. Thinking that she was certainly in jest we found our seats and began to enjoy our evening. Cruella De'Ville immediately followed us to our table and demanded that we either chug our drinks or dust off the cobwebs from her sexy place. Naturally, we decided to try and seduce Cruella. Unfortunately, we all turned to stone and our food got cold. Then we left.",

Went on Cinco de Mayo without a reservation, so wasn't terribly surprised when they said it was a 45-min wait for a table for two. No big deal, since you could get drinks at the bar while waiting.   Here's where the disappointment starts: -We realize that there were two different \"waiting lists\" started so they had to merge them together and guess when people actually had their names put down, ADDING to the wait time.  -Apparently they don't have buzzers to hand out or take numbers to text your table is ready, so unless you were standing 3 feet away from the hostess desk there's a good chance you would miss your name being called.  -When we finally did get seated, the music (from a live DJ) was SO obnoxiously loud that we LITERALLY had to yell at each other to hear. We asked not only our waitress but one of the front desk helpers if it was at possible to turn the music down or give our table to someone else and take the next table called...she said they couldn't.   So, we left.  No point in eating at a place when you can't even enjoy being there.",

Although many tables were free we had to wait because communication needs a lot of improvement between waiters, waitresses and hosts.   The food though: very good. Both times.  We had the cobb salad, chicken mole, steak burrito and it all was delish!   What I did not understand was that the first time we went there chips and salsa were complimentary-the second time we had to order them.   Anyway: I also had a raspberry margarita which was very tasty.   If you don't mind a lil confused service you won't go wrong with this one.",

I dined Saturday July 12, 2014 for the first and last time.  Our server started out very attentive and inquired if we were ready to order frequently. (there may have been ten tables)  A gentleman with a large tray which appears to be some of the items I may have ordered comes out and circles my booth but doesn't make any eye contact. He circles the area a second time before placing my food on someone else's table. I acknowledged the server and of course he picked the food up and brought it to me. Another server comes out and does the exact same thing to me and my guest a second time.  No one fills the water or even comes back after the mix up the remainder of our lunch. The restaurant was nearly empty you would think these types of errors wouldn't occur!   I was highly displeased with the lack of service and mediocre foods especially  after having another guest served my food before brining it to my table!  $50 for decent shrimp ceviche, excellent chips and guacamole, terrible empanadas, and a yummy Sangria!   My lunch date enjoyed her $15 lobsters and I must admit they looked delish too!!!  I will not recommend nor return to this location but I would try in another city!",

We ordered chips and salsa -plot spoiler, they had the flavor of Tostitos chips and Pace salsa and were not complimentary like so many Mexican restaurants offer. Very Americanized-not awful-just not anything spectacular at all. The \"steak\" nachos were very disappointing... think a step above movie theater nachos. The steak looked so much like ground beef that I thought there had been a mistake. It wouldn't be complete without melted nacho cheese. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't velveeta, but it wasn't melted cheesy delicious. Just very mediocre. I can't speak to other entrees, however overall quality was lacking. I would avoid if you can.",

    "text": "Chayo is a new Mexican style restaurant located in the Linq.  It's right outside the Quad, near the new side entrance to the Flamingo.  The restaurant has a mechanical bull located near the middle of it, even though I'm not quite sure how that relates to a Mexican restaurant.  I've usually seen those type of things at country western bars.  Just seemed a bit tacky to me, but I'm sure it helps the nightlife business.  Anyway, on to the food.  The menu here is not large by any means, but they do have some standard tex-mex type cuisine.  You can get enchiladas, fajitas, tacos, etc.  I ordered the shrimp fajitas, which were $20+.  Just a piece of advice, skip the fajitas.  The shrimp was ok, but most of the other items were bland.  I almost forgot that we did have some chips and salsa, which were good.  The salsa was spicy, although not too bad.  The only drawback is that you have to pay for chips and salsa here ($3), and I know most of us aren't used to that.  Those are complimentary at every other Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, but hey, it's Vegas.  My wife ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were dynamite.  I would highly recommend those, as they are full of flavor.  Two people could easily split them.  Overall, I thought this place was pretty good.  Not my favorite, but certainly not bad.  I'd like to try one of the other restaurants in the Linq area next time.",

The senorita especially BC it was like a strawberry moscato mmmm!   Then we ordered steak fajitas & lobster tacos. Both were so delicious and flavorful...not too spicy but just right & the corn that came on the side was heaven in my mouth!! The blonde manager stopped by to check how everything was, she was really sweet & reminded us to check out taco Tuesday!   Everything was really good & I can't wait to come back with my family. The decor was really cool & everything wAs great. Next time I want to try the sopes & I was disappointed I didn't order the guacamole when the table next to me did and it looked so good, so I'll definitely try that next time too!",

DISLIKE  Pricing is slightly high for what you're actually getting. Server was aloof. Had to ask for napkins for the table even after entrees were dropped off. They \"ran out\" of one of their few specialty cocktails. There's a charge for chips and salsa. $14 drink was served in a plastic cup. One of my ribeye tacos had a piece of meat that had not been cut so I almost choked on it.  LIKE  The guacamole with pork rinds. The decor. The upstairs patio view of The Linq.  LOVE  Nothing.",

We had initially gone just to have a few drinks but decided to order dinner while we there as well.  We had actually stumbled upon it trying to see if the Linq was up and running yet, but we are glad we found it.  The food is tapas style and I definitely recommend the Lobster Taco's and the Sope's.  Both were delicious.  Their drinks pretty good too.  The waitresses and female bartenders have a whole lot of cleavage hanging out which is fine unless you have young kids, but really it wouldn't even hit the Richter Scale of things you don't want your kids to see if you have them on the Las Vegas strip anyways.  Call me conservative.  Very pretty girls though.  If you are going up the stairs to use the bathroom, be sure to check out all the sombrero's on the wall in the staircase.  Very cool.  I loved the decor.  I wished there was more people there and that the mechanical bull was going when we were there but I think we caught them seriously a few days after they opened.    I will definitely be going back and taking friends there while they are in town.",

We went to Chayo when it first opened for my last birthday, and the service was pretty abysmal.  I was drinking that night, and nothing bothered me too much.  However, it took about 40 minutes to get our food on a Tuesday night.  No one offered an explanation, and our table of six agreed that it must have been those bugs that every restaurant needs to iron out at the beginning or the size of the party and didn't hold it against them.  Tonight, however, solidified our original impressions.  My boyfriend and I sat down and quickly ordered our drinks/food.  The server, a tall, blonde woman, was incredibly helpful and we truly appreciated her help.  However, the food runner sat our food down at another table after about 25 minutes of waiting, and didn't bring our refire for an additional 23 minutes.  When he did, the food was cold.  Our server was great and had some of our check comp'd, but the runner was having a really rough night.  At least two tables in our immediate vicinity also had some of their checks covered.  The food is good, but the expiditing and running left something to be desired. Hopefully they can get it together soon!",

We were seated right away and were right next to the mechanical bull pit so we had some entertainment. The food was decent, the Guac, which the waitress claimed they were well known for, was horrible. It had way too much lime juice and was runny. The salsa on the other hand was fire! Well worth the $3 for chips & salsa. I had Carnitas tacos which were good once the guac was removed and my husband had the steak burrito which was good. Our waitress started out well but went down hill thru the meal as it became hard to get her attention and we had to routinely ask for the obvious, like utensils and napkins when our meal arrived. So, decent food but mediocre service.",

    "text": "Im pretty surprised this place only has 3 stars...I really liked it! Growing up in California, I will admit I can be a bit of a Mexican-food-snob. But I thought that everything we had was seriously delicious!  It was our last afternoon in Vegas before heading home when we landed at Chayo. I had scoped out the menu several days prior when I was wandering through the Linq and made a metal note to try to make it back sometime before we left. As luck would have it, it happened to be a Tuesday. As we all know, Mexican food + Tuesday = Taco Tuesday. Score! Here this means half price on all tacos and 2 for one house margaritas. We decided to cash in on both.  We started out with an order of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Man. This stuff is delicious. I don't know if I was in need of some seriously substantial food by now or if their chips and quac really are as good as they tasted that day. Either way, my mouth was seriously happy.  We ordered the Chayo Chopped Salad with grilled/seasonal fish (mahi), an order of the Carnitas Tacos, a side of black beans, an iced tea, and the house marg's (on special) The salad was fresh and yummy. Fish was cooked perfectly and not too dry. Black beans were standard. Nothing over the top as far as they went. I really like black beans though so I was still happy even though they were pretty \"average\". The carnitas tacos were seriously delicious. The carnitas was wonderfully tender. Not too greasy with a really yummy \"carnitas flavor\"- prob my favorite dish. Margaritas were VERY drinkable, despite being the \"cheap\" option, made with Sauza and whatever they use as a margarita mix (not overly sweet) I can be pretty picky about margaritas since its typically my drink of choice and these were solid. Even the iced tea had a great fresh-brwewd taste that was really thirst quenching.  Total came to be about 50 bucks (without tip) For everything we got (...in VEGAS!) that was a seriously amazing deal.  Next time we are in town I will def try to hit this place up again. ...a Tuesday would be even better!",

I had a stomach ache after eating them. My friend got the (fried) lobster tacos and they tasted like rubber. We split a mango and watercress salad which sounded a lot better than it was. It was slathered in honey mustard dressing. Hmmm, last time I went to Mexico, I don't recall that being a popular condiment. When I complained to the waiter that we hated the salad, he just shrugged.

My husband ordered fajitas and they were also not good.  There was a large grilled onion on top which was weird. Are you supposed to make a fajita with a big piece of onion then have no onion left for the rest?? He didn't think the meat (what little there was) was very good either. Next time we go to the linq we'll try some place else. There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.",

Food Order took 25 minutes to come to the bar and it was wrong. Mine came out right but hers was not. There was no sense of urgency with the staff to get the order put in and corrected. I had to tell them that I would like to get this today. So now we have to wait again for the new order.  The food finally came out and the salad was disgusting Just swimming in a very bad tasting dressing. My burger was a sloppy mess. It was cooked correctly though. The bartender did get the salad off the bill because it took so long. No manager ever came over to talk to us. She just walked around the room obnoxiously rattling her keys and joking with staff.  I will not be returning. For a new place to try and attract locals. They need to train staff better and up there game. From top to bottom.",

There is outside as well as inside seating and there are bars up and downstairs. Watching people try to tame the mechanical bull is always a good time.

I ordered a quesadilla because I don't eat meat. Well this quesadilla was strictly cheese. The menu said pickled vegetable but to my surprise that did not mean an assortment with bell peppers. They literally gave me about 5 small slices of carrots and a few piece of onions. Ummmm WHAT!? It wasn't even enough for one slice of the quesadilla if I really did want to eat it. It didn't come with salsa, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, or tomatoes so you may want to ask. Basically cheese and flour with no flavor. A waste of money.",

The food's delicious, the music is lively, and there's a mechanical bull. It's Mexican dining meets Las Vegas Blvd. The ceviche was fresh and flavorful. The roasted corn enchiladas were amazing with just the right amount of kick. The pastor chicken tacos: out of this world delicious. The service here is excellent, I've been several times, and the staff seems to be having a good time as they provide great recommendations and friendly table talk. Finish up your meal with a flan, not your traditional variety but tasty just the same. On top of it all it's a great people watching spot, with great patio seating. The only downside is that along with the fun of being on the Strip, you deal with the crowds of the Strip. Definitely a favorite of mine.",

    "text": "I've eaten here several times and it used to be one of my go to fav spots on the promenade. However, after tonight's experience I won't be back. No smiles at all from the hostesses. Between the three of them they couldn't crack a smile. They wouldn't seat us until half our party was there, even though we said we would like to be seated and begin ordering drinks. After a few minutes one of the hostesses asked us if we would like to sit at the bar until seated. Sure, we said. The bar maid came and took an order for drinks. Our party showed up, neither of the drinks had been made yet, she was in the process of making a house margarita, which we took to the table. We were told to order the pina colada at the table. Then it just went south. The waiter was very unfriendly and difficult to understand because of his heavy accent. I tried ordering the pina colada and he argued it wasn't a good drink and I should have a margarita. I've had their pina coladas many times and enjoy them very much. He took everyone else drink order, after upselling everyone to margaritas. The table received all the drinks except my pina colada. My buddy ordered a margarita which turned out to be awful. He sent it back and got a pina colada. I still hadn't even gotten mine. We told one of the ladies who worked there and she informed the manager. The manager tells the waiter who then goes in to some kind of explanation of why I didn't get my drink flinging his hands around. The food was 'ok', terribly overpriced - which is par for the course being on the strip. Then, when the check came, he refused to split it three ways leaving us to figure who had what, add it up and figure the tax! Ridiculous! I went to the manager and told him the situation, he took the check and they split it three ways. I had no intention of tipping because the service was just plain awful. But because we had a party of 8 they added a tip of OVER 20 percent!  I can't recommend this place to anyone - stay away! Save your money and go to Denny's. They greet you with a smile and it's not over priced. Plus, you get the pleasure of tipping some on what they're worth not being charged for service you didn't receive. Chayo, if your service is so good, give your wait staff a raise. Otherwise, quit over charging your patrons, especially locals who already pay for the parking. I won't be back. Steer clear!",

Very, very well prepared, presented with a solid kick of spice.   I/we will never go back due to the horrific service and waste of 90 minutes that should have been half of that.

I wish we had walked out because the experience only worsened!   1) had to walk up to the bar to place my food order since no one came to our table  2) took another 45 mins just to get chips and guacamole and chicken taquitos   3) took another  30 mins to get our dinner which was taco plates.   4)very tough dry pulled pork, super hard to chew. Mediocre rice and beans.  5) since it took so long, I browsed their yelp (something I should've done before hand) read a review that someone purchased a Groupon worth 50% off which seemed super ideal because I wasn't happy and honestly didn't want to pay full price at this point. I purchased the Groupon. Got the bill and was told by the waiter in fine print it reads can't be used on a holiday!! The holiday he was referring to was Martin Luther King Day on Monday! (I came in on a Saturday night) two days before the MLK holiday! WOW!  ****Zero stars!",

Kind of weird experience with drunk people bumping into us while we were eating. Other than that it's a great place. Came here twice in a weekend, since it was close to our hotel. We ordered chicken fajitas which came in over sauteed onions and bell peppers. The flour tortillas were great. We had To ask for more Bc they don't give enough for the amount of chicken and veggies they give. Also the chicken is all white meat! It's So delicious and juicy. For dessert we ordered the churros!

    "text": "Ate dinner on a Friday night at the back bar, close to the outdoor mall between Linq and Flamingo. Ordered  a named margarita, was far too sweet, could not taste any of the tequila. Tortilla Soup was good but Three Cheese Burrito was not, and shortly after had some digestive discomfort due to it. Two bartenders, who were present, seemed distracted with duties around the other corner of the bar, so service was mediocre. Prices are too high given the relatively low quality of the drink and food. Strongly suggest other Mexican/Tequila options nearby along the strip hotels, I would be back.",

I learned new owners took over 3-4 months ago. The quality just wasn't there. Our bill came out to be $210 for crap appetizers, drinks and sub par service. We paid that much for the best meal at Texas De Brazil the night before- with double the food, amazing drinks and more people. Didn't seem to add up. Overall, the value wasn't there. Much better restaurants in Vegas to choose from.",

Very unmemorable. The one thing I do remember are the margaritas! The margaritas were phenomenal and the decor was absolutely amazing! Besides that, find dinner elsewhere but totally stop in here for a few drinks.  Service was also terrible considering the prices at this place. So if I do go back, it's for drinks and maybe a seat outside if the weather is nice. Plenty of other places to try in Vegas!",

When our food did finally show up, we watched them try to give it to two other tables before us.   My chopped salad wasn't so chopped. The steak pieces were all with large chunks of fat and gristle. I had to take the steak off the salad and cut the bad parts off.  The salad was overly soaked with dressing, weighing the Romain down.  The citrus was a nice touch though.   We sat at 2pm. We finally got our bill, and paid at 335. Prices were slightly above average. Horrible service times and lack of attention. He was friendly but that about it.",

She then realized she completely forgot about us (my boyfriend overheard her tell her coworker).   We got nachos and chicken tacos.

I've had several items on their menu, and I don't have any complains.  The drinks are also very good; especially if you like tequila (duh!).    They need to work on their customer service, though.  The hostesses are nice and very helpful, but the waitresses/waiters we've had are terrible.  They rarely smile, they always look stressed, and fail to check up on you and at least ask if we need anything else, or how about \"how's everything?\".  Just this last time I was there (Sunday), it took them over 10 minutes to acknowledge us!  That's the only disappointing part about this place.",

    "text": "This is a restaurant that has all the potential for being a great place to spend some time enjoying the promenade at the Linq, and getting a bite to eat. The space is open and has high ceilings with plenty of high top bar tables to people watch. The food is decent to good and the presentation as well. Where they really need to improve is in the area of customer service and attentiveness. On three separate trips to Las Vegas, we've stopped in because of its great location and its inviting look. Each time, however, the service remains the same. Once we've gotten seated by a friendly hostess, we have had to wait upwards of 15 minutes to have someone even offer us a drink or acknowledge our presence. I'm not talking about a packed restaurant situation here either. Maybe 10-15 tables out of I'm guessing 75.  The servers unfailingly apologize for the long wait and are friendly when they do show up which is a definite plus, but I'm guessing a little time management training or someone who can lead by example. The food takes a little longer than your typical Mexican restaurant but tastes good, so no worries there. Try to get your check 15 minutes before you want it so you won't be frustrated having to wait for someone to collect it and bring it back. All in all, it's decent food with a less than stellar waitstaff. Would I go back armed with the knowledge of all this? Probably",

We ordered chips and salsa and the few chips on top were big pieces the rest were crumbs. We had to flag down the server to get better chips since they are not complimentary we wanted to get decent chips for our money (not complimentary is no biggie but to get crumbs when you are paying for them is not okay).  Okay finished eating...The food was just okay. Nothing to write home about. My dad thought his carne asada was dry. My moms vegetables were grilled not sauteed like she ordered. My dad and I thought the beans were watery, however my bf enjoyed them. I ordered a Sprite half through my meal and it was flat.   Service never got any better throughout our meal. The server never checked on us. We ran out of water no one ever came to offer us a refill or even noticed we were low/out. We had to get his attention. Overall, I would not come back here. The service itself ruined the meal and the food was not good enough to bring me back.  Update: we haven't received our check we've been done eating for about 15 minutes now just sitting here waterless and he still has not stopped at our table.",

The server came around finally and argued with me that the drink I received was what I ordered. NOT the case. He was so rude.

I came with a group of 6 when no one else was eating in the restaurant. We proceeded to order & it went all down hill from there. We asked for a side of guac & chips to come before our meal, but didn't receive the guac until the meals came & when I asked I was told it was a side of guac that came with my fajitas. We requested to order guac & chips a 2nd time, we were brought the chips at the end of the meal & when we asked where the guac was, they said the guac brought with my meal went with the chips. Then we were told we didnt order the guac & chips & it was a miscommunication. On multiple occasions, after asking multiple people we requested sweet n low, napkins, refills & hot sauce. None of these items were brought until we were done eating, despite reoccurring requests. When we asked for a manager, we waited over 20+ minutes & asked 2x before a manager came over. He never gave us his name, wasnt wearing a name tag & didnt apologize for the service. He comped the corn that came with my meal (which they also messed up)... it was part of my meal, how do you comp that?? & gave us a small discount. We asked for to go boxes multiple times & the waitress Martika was flustered the whole meal, despite us being polite & understanding the whole time.

Their chips are crispy and have a nice spice to them, and the guacamole was buttery but not very flavorful. The salad was good, with a honey-mustard-like dressing, although there was too much of it. The enchiladas were disappointingly flavorless -- basically plain chicken in tortillas with a bland sauce over them and a few garnishes  like avocado slices and onion and radish slices (?).  Service was good enough.  My impression was that the place is trying to be upscale Mexican but falls short on the food. Not a good value.",

    "text": "Getting used to slow service in Vegas but our waitress was at least very apologetic and made up for it. The food was excellent! Great atmosphere and patio seating. Good energy and the bull riding thing was kind of a funny thing to watch. Really good salsa and chips. Only thing is they do cost extra which is a little weird for chips and salsa. But I would for sure go back here!! We all loved our meals! I'm craving that salsa now!",

    "text": "I am a Colorado Mexican food girl. However, this New Mexican style is amazing. We ate there twice in 5 days while in town. The second time we took 10 people with us. The service was amazing! The chips and salsa good. They are $3...who cares you will spend that in 3 minutes in a slot machine.  I had the Rib eye tacos! YUM!!! Delish! So tasty and so full of steak! My hubby had the sweet corn enchiladas. He was in heaven. With beers and tip it cost us about $60 for both of us. We left full and happy. No complaints.  Well one! There is not one near me!",

    "text": "The food was a respectable combination of value and taste. While I wasn't personally blown away by it, I did find our waitress Christina was particularly attentive and considerate. She made sure we were well taken care of from start to finish, and had a very energetic, optimistic attitude that was quite contagious.   I find the atmosphere and the decor inviting, everything from the semblance of rope around the booths, art with various bulls and Mexican cultural emblems, and cool lighting. I would say that the place definitely did look the part, and had the staff to more than accommodate the venue.  I had a steak burrito that had a fantastic sauce, but I didn't think it did anything unusually spectacular for me.  This place is a good, consistent spot that I think delivers what you might expect from an upscale, casual dining Mexican restaurant on the sidelines of a casino.  Our server Christina even gave me a spontaneous turbo massage so that I would remember to give a review. I might be a tough critic, but the review has been delivered. 5* waitress 5* atmosphere 5* staff 4* value (given Vegas standards which tend to be pricey), and 3 1/2* food. It fits a role, and fits it well.",

We waited for a while then decided to just get our own drinks at the bar. While my husband was at the bar another hostess told me the table was reserved. I told her we were just seated here and she argued saying she didn't seat anyone here. Eventually another hostess told her we were seated here. No one apologized and we still had no one waiting on our table.  Between the really rude hostess that basically called me a liar and the lack of service, we won't likely be back.",
