    "text": "Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  It honestly couldn't have been any better.  First of all, sit outside... the ambiance is amazing.  Why would you sit in a dark room when this is available.  There were two 'shows' while we ate... one with a giant frog over the waterfall (I know, right?) but it was great.  It was the puppet frog singing \"Wonderful World\" and the other was a light show, but not in any way cheesy.  It just helped create this relaxed, elegant, but still fun atmosphere.  It's hard to describe the environment... not Vegas, not 'Disney', not touristy... don't know... but very much \"Wynn.\"    Now, the actual dinner.    The service was impeccable.  Our waiter and his partner were spot on, never an empty glass, always asking if we needed anything and if we were talking, they'd wait then come back when you finished... or, they'd sneak in and fill your glasses without you even knowing.  When they weren't \"on camera,\" they were still smiling and friendly just walking around... so many times, waiters put on the act when they get to your table and then you see them more 'real' when they step away.  Not with our waiters.  It honestly went above what I'd expect.  There were also manager(s?) quietly walking around checking on things for quality control.  That's a management team that gives a damn beyond the lip service of 'caring about customers'.  My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  She got a lychee martini and I got a Reisling... both were amazing.  I've never had a better Reisling in my life, honestly... I can't recommend it more highly.  (I don't care if it doesn't \"pair\" with steak, it just tastes great.)  We got a Rib Eye and a NY Strip and split them.  I didn't use any sauce except for a little creamy horseradish here and there but you can eat them without anything.  They were cooked perfectly and the selection of meat was perfect... no gristle anywhere.  They do this way to making it just crispy enough around the edges while maintaining the softness inside.  We also got mashed potatoes, which were also great.... probably 3,000 calories though, haha.      Get a reservation though, that's for sure.  I got mine about three weeks out but it gets tight quickly.    Overall... I can't thank SW Steakhouse enough for a better night catching up with a good friend.  Everything was perfect, top to bottom.  You couldn't have a more \"five star\" review than SW Steakhouse.",

It never disappoints. Make sure you try to come when it's warm out and request a seat outside on the patio so you can view the Lake of Dreams which has a little show every 30 minutes. So fun! Just adds to the decadence.   I've always gotten the Filet Mignon and my husband has ordered the Prime Rib.  Both steaks were cooked to perfection. We've also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Very tasty.   The servers are very formal and attentive.   Overall, this place is an amazing Vegas experience. Highly recommended, Worth every dollar.",

They came in auctioning plates because they had no idea which one belonged to who. At the end more than one person stayed with their plate the way they got it, just all wrong. Although a very nice place, because you're paying top dollar for your steak you would expect better service. I was very disappointed!!!",

    "text": "Worst experience I've ever had at a steakhouse. I called and made reservations for 7 people about four weeks in advance and requested a table with a clear view of the water/show. The day of the reservation I called out of courtesy to give them a heads up that only 6 people will be dining instead of 7, I again reminded them of the request I made to have a table with a clear view. We arrive at the steakhouse an hour early because our party wanted to have drinks at the neighboring bar outside. We checked in with them and AGAIN reminded them that we requested the table with the view. Well we show up at 8pm ready to be seated and the hostess begins to walk me back to literally the last table in the restaurant in the back near the kitchen. I stopped her and said we requested a table with a view, to which she says \"since you called today and made this reservation we couldn't guarantee it.\" I was shocked I responded back loudly and quite pissed off \"I made this reservation over three weeks ago, I called today to let you guys know that it would only be for 6 people instead of 7 out of courtesy to you, so figure out what you're going to do to get us a table with a view.\" We go back to the hostess table to wait for them and they find us a table with a \"view\" it was a long awkward table in the back and half of us could see. If the only problem I had with this restaurant was the lack of view and their incompetence with seating, I wouldn't have taken the time to write this, however I'm afraid the experience only got worse. We were celebrating two birthdays at this dinner, mine and my aunt's. I was in charge of making dinner reservations and I remember this place being good years ago but wow things have changed. First, it took us nearly two hours to get our main courses. TWO HOURS. I understand it's Saturday and it's busy but two hours is insane. I got the king crab pasta that was listed under the \"chef's selections\". When my food arrived it looked as if they found two hermit crabs and put them in a food processor and then sprinkled them on my pasta. It was totally pathetic. My boyfriend, for whatever reason got the vegan raviolis (he's not vegan I don't know why he ordered this at a steakhouse) but his stupid vegan raviolis were much better than my chef selection hermit crab pasta. My mother got chicken which she said was good but nothing to rave about. My uncle got the NY strip and he said it was very good. I'm not sure what the others got but by the time we got the food two hours after we sat down we were all so pissed off. The staff tried to make amends by bringing us a tower of funnel cakes for the table along with our birthday desserts but by this time we had been sitting for three hours. Although the funnel cakes were delicious(when is fried dough dipped in caramel and sugar not delicious)they can't change how long we waited, where we were sitting, and the hermit crab pasta. Looking back on this all I remember enjoying about this 3 hour long dinner was the stupid funnel cakes and the pretzel bread...I feel like at a steakhouse you should remember entrees instead of food you can get at carnivals for much cheaper and for sure a lot faster.",

However, when my Alaskan king crab soup came, the crab didn't taste fresh (was hard and lumpy), and the puff pastry was over toasted and burnt. Then the brussels sprouts came and very soggy. The veggies were undercooked and still hard. My friends ordered the foie gras which came overlooked and had to be sent back. Nothing was as expected. Really disappointing for a meal at over $100/per person. One star is for the tasteful decor, the other is for their bread; which, unfortunately, turned out to be the best part of the meal.",

I don't understand the negative food ratings. Service was great too. The entrees took a little while to come out but the wait was properly balanced out by the three mini lake shows, which again, you don't usually get while spending decent money at a restaurant. The red and blue dancing-balls were our favorite.   Only gripe was the skimpy pour for a glass of wine. Prime steaks came out as ordered, and the veggie plates consisted of quality ingredients.",

I followed with an heirloom tomato salad from tomatoes that had just come into season as were delivered that morning.  It was the first day they were offering that seasonal salad.  Best tomato salad I have had in a while.  For my entree I had the ribeye which was one of the tastiest steaks I have ever had.  It was perfectly cooked medium rare and very flavorful.  The quality of the meat was fantastic.  The sides were good as well.  Definitely worth a try when visiting Vegas.  Be sure to call in advance so that you can reserve a table.

    "text": "How can you call yourself a \"Steakhouse\" and NOT know how to properly cook a steak?  I take my steaks seriously and after seeing SW Steakhouse featured on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\", I had high expectations. However, I left completely disappointed and scratching my head as to how SW Steakhouse even came to be on the show.  On Sunday, 9.11.11, my friends and I (party of 7) came to dinner at SW Steakhouse at 5:30 PM with reservations.  We were seated outdoors overlooking the Lake of Dreams which I had requested; a must for a picturesque dinner.  F O O D *BACON CHEESE BREAD - 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=DIbahOb0BjAVX_-UWzvgJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> Served warm, the bread was buttery with savory smoky bacon bits. The encrusted cheese gave it a subtle salty richness.  *SAUTEED FOIE GRAS w/ Grilled Pineapple, Brioche Toast, Blackberry Jam ($24) - 4 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=BTysi-8pPcSmVUzOOoTTWw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> The foie gras was nicely seared and had a luxurious richness without being overly greasy. The brioche gave it a nice texture contrast and the blackberry jam's subtle tartness help balance out all the flavors nicely.  *42 OZ. CHILI RUBBED DOUBLE RIBEYE (Serves Two; $106) - 2.5 STARS (Please note: You can add the chili rub to any steak) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=Os4j8i4_9JNNoYiy8ug5Zg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> Featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\", the Chili Rubbed Ribeye was sorely disappointing. Though the ribeye was super rich in beefy flavor, it was overcooked. Requested medium rare, our steak was more like medium well. The chili rub which consisted of cayenne, cumin, and other spices was too overpowering and took away from the steak's natural flavor. It was like a glorified carne asada.   Just to note, everyone's steak in our table except for one person was overcooked; that's a HUGE problem if you're a \"steakhouse\".  *SIDES (Serves 2-3 people; $10 each) -BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED CORN - 4.5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=CYLC3lwpL4oeN_U8pd0Rtw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> -PARMESEAN CREAMED SPINACH - 3 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=RqIEXlzqknOsDwf2h5O7AA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> -MAC 'N CHEESE - 3 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=UmWwruy4gLCTLNwilfxVug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> -FINGERLING POTATOES w/ Green Beans & Bacon - 3 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=ThOijLkCcmw-PSFFYVuaxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>  The only side worth mentioning was the Black Truffle Creamed Corn. It was slightly chunky, yet creamy with a fresh sweetness. The addition of the black truffles added a decadent earthiness to the corn.  *FUNNEL CAKE & STRAWBERRIES w/ Anglaise, Salty Caramel and Fudge Sauce ($18) - 4.5 STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=3A-B4f4ztqIfi04VXQGILQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a> The star of the night, the funnel cakes were beautifully presented on tree branches with a accompanying trio of sauces. It was crisp, light and airy. A mixture of the anglaise and salty caramel  gave it a creamy sweetness.  S E R V I C E Having dined at numerous fine dining restaurants, one would have a certain expectation in terms of service especially at the prestigious Wynn. Just like the steaks, the service was disappointing.  Our waitress was MIA most of the night and never once checked on us to see how we were doing; yet we saw her repeatedly go to other tables with older patrons. Perhaps, people should be reminded that Generation Y are the \"foodies\" and \"yelpers\".  When one of my friend's steak was cooked almost to a well done (requested medium rare), we had to wave our hands in the air just to get her attention to send it back. Only then did she ask, if the rest of our steaks were properly cooked. That's when our entire table went silent and I responded, \"No, most of our steaks were overcooked...\"  When you're paying at least $100/person, you should never have to wave down your waitress/waiter at a restaurant of this caliber and for a place that's part of the Wynn family, you would think they would have tried to rectify everyone's overcooked steaks especially having mentioned it. I rarely send back my food, but our waitress should have least offered to make things right but she didn't. INEXCUSABLE.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Classy, modern and swanky. The outdoor dining area overlooking the Lake of Dreams was breathtaking. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=1urgH7YBnqfhIKUG3R82FQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>  During our 2.5 hour dinner, there were two water shows: a frog singing the \"Moon Song\" and two balls mating and having a baby ball. Though it was entertaining and cute, I thought it was a bit cheesy.  After our disappointing dining experience at SW Steakhouse, I can't help but wonder if being featured on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" was merely a paid advertisement.",

We were seated right away and had drinks just has fast.  Once we all ordered it seemed like it took a long time to get the entrees, but it's not a big deal and was worth the wait. Prices are a bit steep but again this is the new Las Vegas and inside the Wynn.   Our meal was really good!  Starting with the 4-5 different bread's  and butter, it was very nice. Shrimp cocktail was good.  Kale and goat cheese salad was ok.   Awesome aged Bone in Porterhouse!  A great filet mignon that needed only a butter knife to cut.  The Dover sole with two prawns over lump crabmeat was good as well as everything else.   My vodka martini was the only thing nobody at the table liked. I think it was just vodka with 3 olives.",

Steaks are consistently cooked to perfection, and the wine list never disappoints (this past trip we had the 2011 Blackbird Cabernet, which was delicious!).  My go-to meal is typically -  - Yellowfin Tuna Tartare appetizer - New York Strip, medium rare - Shaved Brussels sprouts - A bottle of one of their Cabs (and there are plenty to choose from)!  I've tried most of the Steakhouse options on the Las Vegas strip.  There are PLENTY to choose from, including those with some big name chefs.  I've found little reason to keep hoping around.

We made ours for 7pm for a view on the terrace; day of we switched it to 8:30pm and apparently they CLOSE it after 8.  Boo!!   *It's on the bottom floor of the Wynn Hotel - go down the escalators. *The rolls are to die for.  I would seriously come here for the bread alone, it is THAT good. *The bathrooms are so lush and purdy.  Stalls so airtight and quiet you can't hear if anyone else is in there!!  My loud ass sister walked in and I didn't even hear her!! *Food is, as expected, top notch.  Everything is ala carte.   Loved our steaks.  We recommend the cream corn (yes.) and mac & cheese.  Skip the mashed potatoes. *Service is impeccable.  We went with a large group (6), and they do this lovely thing where they wait for the last person to finish eating, then, in a choreographed dance, all the servers clear the table in about 4.2 seconds.  WOW.   *As I said, I was hoping for a little more of a romantic or personal feel considering the price point - I felt pretty close to other tables and could hear their conversations.  The lighting is bright.  I prefer the layout of, say, Prime Steakhouse in Bellagio where you have your own area and it's more dimly lit.   On the bright side, you could totally go here with your mother-in-law or business partner!  Highly recommend for groups, but perhaps not for \"Anniversary Night\".",

We are both trying not to eat too heavy or too late so we split a steak and ordered side dishes of vegetables. The waiter suggested half  orders of the vegetables and splitting the Caesar salad. That was very helpful because half an order is plenty for two people. The salad was really delicious and split is plenty to eat for two.

    "text": "Great disapointment  Took my girl friend for her birthday to what I had in the past experienced as one of the best  steak restaurants. We were greeted with happy birthday wishes. The New York steak was cooked perfectly but it took a workout to chew each piece. I ordered the lobster tail that I had experience other times. The $45  tail was the less than one pound size and way over cooked. This was the type and size of one you would get at Red Lobster. I placed my empty water glass at the front of the table. It remained empty. At the end of the meal as we had coffee it was necessary to remind the server of my girl friends birthday. With a sour face he finally brought her a one inch slice of chocolate with a candle. Some may wonder why I did not complain about the poor food quality. I simply did not want to ruin the birthday dinner for my girl friend. The evening was topped off with a horrible experience when my girl friend went out onto the adjacent patio to see if she could located the British couple who were sitting next to us at dinner and who had invited us for a drink. The patio hostess demanded that my girl friend get off the patio.. she kept repeating that we couldn't go out there and that there is a three drink minimum. I tried to explain that my girl friend had gone out there to locate someone. It did not matter to this hostess. My girlfriend was speaking to the British gentleman when I summoned her and we left the premises. All in all this is not a place I would ever recommend to a friend.",

    "text": "I can count the number of times that I've been to vegas on one hand.  Unfortunately, i don't really drink.. or gamble.. or enjoy vegas in general... (I know~ I'm weird).  But with this last trip to reunite with old college buddies, I experienced the most marvelous steak joint ever.  It was pretty darn epic.  SW outranks any past experience at a steak house I've experienced.  I'd come back to vegas just to eat here.  I hear that SW Steakhouse is a close competition to Del Frisco (which I have not experienced).. but the members of our group who have been to both preferred SW over DF.  We had reservations for our group of 7 and were seated near to but not next to the great Lake of Dreams (which is both pretty trippy and cool.. gorgeous view tho!)  Started off with a couple of bottles of wine and THE BEST BACON BREAD EVER.  It was hard for the girls not to scarf and fill up on this bread.  The cream butter with two types of fancy smancy sea salt was soo good.  Soft, creamy, and melt in your fattty mouth heaven.  I adore bread.  Both the french and the bacon bread were delicious.  (Take a gander which one was better)..  Some of the members had appetizers.. and the BLT salad came with this FAT solid 1 inch slice of premium bacon.. balancing atop crisp lettuce and heirloom tomatoes.  It was a gorgeous sight.  I can only dream of how big this slab of bacon was before being cooked down.  Our meal was absolutely delicious.    BF and I split the Porter for two (I did the math and it was cheaper than the individual steaks).  IT WAS DIVINE.  Came out sizzling and hot in a huge plate (it was a shit load of meat for two people~ i think like 40 ozs?  I know~ fat@ss. haha).  We added the fois gras - which was an awesome move cuz it made everything melt in your mouth.  There was a side of.. not leeks.. but similar to celery root .. just can't remember.. but it was all heavenly.  We got sides to split for the table... and YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY GET THE CREAMED CORN.  I don't normally enjoy creamed veggies but this was ... sex rolled into a winning lotto ticket and a double promotion at work.  Yes.  It was awesome.  The mac and cheese was meh~ not bad but a little bland.. and... I can't remember the other sides but they were all fabulous.  TRUFFLED CREAM CORN. GET IT.  Service was great.  Wine and food abundant.  Great friends. It was by far the best experience second to Chippendales.  Definitely recommend this place and would absolutely return (once I save up enough money haha).  It broke down to about $100 per person which isn't bad considering the quality, alcohol and service.  FABULOUS. Added to the List of Ya Really Gotta.   So GO! :)",

    "text": "This is located at the Wynn. As Wynn is full of whimsy, the SW Steakhouse is awash in white. It was very well appointed and tasteful. The ambiance is definitely spot on. We were seated near the balcony with a view of the waterfall. I suggest you sit facing the waterfall upon sitting. It has mini shows that's very enjoyable while you eat your steak. We made an appt beforehand and were seated promptly. The service was graceful. Everyone has been very nice on this particular Vegas trip. The sommelier came to the table and I chose a moscato by the glass. Then, the bartender came to the table and suggested to mother that she have a lychee martini since she stated that she'd like something sweet. She also asked to add very little alcohol as possible. The bartender assured her that he'll do the best he can. If she isn't satisfied, just let him know and he'll take care of it. Like in any high end establishments, no is simply not in the vocabulary. The lychee martini was delicious. We had sirloin steak as we're fans of a bit of fat in our steaks. I also had foie gras on the side. The rest of my family loved the steak but I thought it was just ok. I had better foie gras. Because of the food, I decided to give this establishment a three star. But its service and ambience screams five star. Perhaps, try its Kobe beef. It's certified to prepare kobe beef. It must be their specialty.",

    "text": "I've been to nearly all of the highly rated steak places in Vegas, and this one was decidedly mediocre. It wasn't even as good as the less-highly-regarded Botero at the Encore, so that alone was disappointing.   We came here for my little sister's 21st. She started the evening off by ordering a margarita. Odd at a steak place (umm you drink martinis and red wine!), but she's 21, so whatever. It was AWFUL. Undrinkable. Her 21 year old buddy got one as well and both of them couldn't choke them down. I figured the $15 margarita couldn't be THAT bad, so i tried some. Yup, decidedly awful. Ok, so we aren't getting off to a great start...  We got beef carpaccio and foie gras to start. Beef carpaccio was boring, but it tasted decent enough. The foie gras on the other hand was disappointing. Probably ranks close to the bottom of all the foie I've had in Vegas. While it wasn't badly prepared, it was just missing something.  My husband and I made the mistake of splitting the filet mignon and adding lobster. The $49 lobster add on was awful. The chewiest, most flavorless awful lobster I've had in a LONG time. EW. The filet was decent. I liked the crust, but the steak definitely was nothing special. My dad finished maybe 1/3rd of his ribeye before giving up and calling it too blah to eat. Yes, we're brats about steak, but when you are paying $60 per steak you expect it to be mind blowing. I've eaten 5 better steaks in the past month! Sad.   The $18 funnel cake for dessert was fun. It was lots of small funnel cakes randomly stuck in what looked like a mini metal forest sculpture thing. They were tasty. My sister ordered a piece of red velvet cake for her birthday. This was NOT tasty. It was dry and flavorless. How freaking hard is Red Velvet cake ???  Service was decent and the atmosphere was nice. Not a bad evening, but not a spectacular one either. At these prices I guess I just expect more these days! Next time I would choose Cut, Botero, Carnevino, or Strip Steak instead to name a few... The dining at the Wynn seems to be going downhill. No more Daniel, no more Alex, and we are left with mediocre steak and vegan food.",

Was really excited to try it as it's rated as one of the top 25 restaurants in the US (at least thats what the reservation guy told me).   Dishes that stood out: -Crabcake was PERFECT. a way bigger portion than I was expecting and very tasty. -Black truffle cream corn... YUM. super good and surprisingly not that heavy. -The bacon cheese bread thing  was super delicious -Rib Eye was cooked perfectly! The creamy horseradish sauce was also really good.  If you order toe foie gras, it's a hugeeee piece!  Reasons why I'm taking a star off: Risotto- tasted really bland and the consistency of it was strange with the crunchy vegetables Service- from the hostess, to the server, nobody was that friendly. Not sure if SW is going for the stuffy pretentious vibe but I felt like they were annoyed to be working or something..kind of off putting considering I'm eating a $500 meal and celebrating a graduation.  With all the highly rated steakhouses in Vegas, I'm not sure if I would come back to SW right away but still glad I came (and mom paid)!",

I was a little put off initially when within two minutest for being seated, 6 different people had spoken with us, but quickly realized they were a finely tuned team, and all our orders and even our name were kept track of. Of course the steak was exceptional, as were the sides. The wine list is impressive/daunting. During evenings they have the music/light show out on the little pond which although entertaining, can be pretty loud and distracting- it's good for a light hearted group, but if you want quieter/more intimate meal ask to sit inside.",

I would expect nothing less from a restaurant named after THE Steve Wynn.   We were seated very politely. First we received our bread basket, which had a greay assortment of baked breads, including a pretzel bread and a cheese biscuit with bacon pieces baked inside. Yum!  For our meals, my boyfriend ordered a T-bone steak, and it looked amazing. He ate is all, except for the fat he cut off.   I ordered the 9oz. filet mignon, and could only eat half of it. It was so much meat. I want to come here again. I will order this and a side dish for my boyfriend and I, and share both. That is more than enough.   As for the sides we ordered, a vegetable medley and  the creamed spinach. The vegetables were OK, nothing too exciting and the creamed spinach was VERY rich, and I felt it had a little too much cheese. I honestly don't think I would order it again.  The highlight of my dining experience was the giant singing frog that  rises above the waterfall. Sitting right next to the lake was also really beautiful and special. I would love to eat here again, just to sit next to the lake and feel the mist, eat and people watch.   It was not perfect, hence the 4 stars, but I still had a wonderful time, and would return again and again when I get the chance.",

I've only been there twice because it is a little pricey, but it is totally worth it.   From the moment you walk in, they do their best to make you feel welcome. I am young, so I get the shoulder a lot of the time at fancy places. The staff is very knowledgeable in everything they serve. I like to try new beers and the waiter was very informative on their selection and even helped me pair my beer with what I was going to eat. The waitstaff is not intrusive when clearing plates and it seems like they do their best to not talk to you with your mouth full of their awesome steak.   As for the food, it is some of the best I've ever had. Last time I went (July 2013,) we started off with some foie gras and the squash blossoms, which I didn't even know was a food. Everything was excellent. My friend and i got awesome New York steaks, you can add foie gras by the way, and my girlfriend got a filet mignon. The steaks were cooked perfectly and were perfect cuts and extremely tasty.   For dessert, we shared some chocolate cake and ice cream, with a little bit of scotch. Again, it was perfectly done.   The thing about this place that makes it so great is it's 5 star service that doesn't make you feel like you need perfect manners to eat there.   Oh yeah, get the truffle creamed corn as a side.",

Last time I ordered a cesar salad(strong and flavorful with crispy parmesan cheese on top) a perfectly cooked medium filet mignon, and a side order of corn - all 5/5.  I know this is a me too review (who doesn't love this place); but I can honestly say I dont always eat this well at the Wynn. For instance the Sushi place, for all its beauty,  I feel the food is just par at best - compared to many other sushi's throughout the city...the sports bar cafe - I downright hate the food there!  AND yes, it's expensive to dine here - its a top quality steakhouse at the best location, in the very best hotel in LV ...

We asked for a table outdoors so we could see the Lake of Dreams but was placed in a table right in between, although by the end of our meal we were glad they did, because it was getting cold and the Lake of Dreams turned out to be lame (one showed a frog singing \"What a Wonderful World\" and another showed two balls making rated R sounds and out comes a baby ball... Really now? =.='').  Complementary bread & butter. I have to mention that I love their butter, I couldn't stop eating the bread because of the butter.  Appetizer: Maryland Blue Crabcake - They kindly splitted the crabcake for us, so we each had our own. We both liked it, it was flavorful and complex, I can't describe how it tastes but it was good.  Main Course: Porterhouse for Two - We asked for medium rare and it was done to perfection. The filet side was oh-my-god good, it was so tender, so juicy, so flavorful. The strip side, although was very good itself (compared to other strip steaks), when compared next to the filet, it was obvious which is the better cut.  Roasted Sonoma Foie Gras - This is my first time eating foie gras, and it's set some high standards for any future ones I'm going to eat. It literally MELTS in your mouth. The flavor is strong and it has a nice roasted aroma that lingers. With every bite, I wonder why I've never tried it.  Dessert: Funnel Cakes - We thought we were going to get one or two, but no, we got SIX. How is two people going to eat six funnel cakes after so much meat?! Anyways... these are the BEST funnel cakes I've EVER had. It was hot and crisp, comes perched on mini tree branches, served with three dipping sauces: chocolate, some sort of vanilla cream, and caramel. Chocolate is standard. The vanilla cream was very good, not too sweet, it's kinda of like melted vanilla ice cream. Caramel was too sweet, and we both have a sweet tooth.  Advice: break your funnel cake into small pieces and dip it into the vanilla cream instead of spreading it on the funnel cake, it makes the cake soggy really fast. Dip it again in chocolate for a chocolate vanilla ice cream taste!",

My appetizers were excellent, but after a prolonged wait for my bone/in ribeye, it was hard and overcooked. After calling for the metre/d, the response was an acknowledgment. I proceeded to pay my bill and tip at 18% to show class. However, I will not be going to SW again and will advise my friends not to do s.",

The initial greeting at the bar was prompt and courteous, with VERY strong drinks as well.  The first time we dined here we sat indoors and sat outside(lakeside sitting) the third time.  We prefer sitting indoors from a serenity standpoint, but being outside was beautiful as the sun set on the  Wynn in the early evening .  The steaks were AMAZING, perfectly cooked, wonderful sear and impeccably seasoned. Our favorite side is hands down the TRUFFLE CREAMED CORN. yes, it warrants being typed in all caps. Lol.  Run, not walk, to SW.  You will not regret it!",

I came here with my girlfriend on a Sunday night and was shocked at how good the food was.    1.) Steak was perfectly cooked (although pricey at $60 a steak, but SOOOOO GOOD). 2.) The bread was out of this world, especially the bacon bread. 3.) The margaritas were to die for, at $16 a piece, it wasn't too expensive. 4.) The service was outstanding.  Katherie went above and beyond to make our experience top notch. 5.)  The layout was great, half indoor and the half outdoors.  We were lucky that we got there early and were seated right next to the lagoon with perfect views of the nightly show. 6.) The show in the lagoon was an added bonus (the singing frog and the dancing balloons).  Overall, love this place and had a memorable experience.  Will definitely be back, hopefully really soon :)",

I'm not sure, but it could've been aged longer, maybe. We ordered the \"tots\" and truffled potatoes for sides. The tots were kinda blah and the potatoes were ok.

The seared Toro at $35 is worth every bite, and the Chicago-style crusted/charred Rib Eye at 20oz is an excellent finish.  Portions so big we could care less about desserts.  Cut the grease with a fine red from their extensive selection, then head out to the bar for a light show and coffee.  Steak has been the staple of many a customer meetings in Vegas, and I'll definitely be visiting this one on my own dime when I'm there.  Preferred the service , meat, and pricing to Prime in Bellagio, which was our destination the previous night.  Would have been perfect if: - the steak accompaniments matched that of Prime - the waiter not knowing what a Caipirinha is ;-)",

Service is 5 star like there hotel, it's the type of place where a waiter is there to refill your water with every sip.  I thought the show is actually distracting while you're eating but it's great why you wait for your table or afterwards with a drink.

We had plans on going to the encore beach club but sitting and waiting there for a long time made everybody tired and took the mood from excited to disappointed. Then our food came. No it wasn't fantastic. I have tasted better steaks and food somewhere else. Also, the reservation was made for a birthday on our party. No slice of cake or mention about it from our waiter or anything close to a nice gesture. Then why would their customer representative ask if there's anything we are celebrating?

The setting could not be more beautiful with the waterfall background as your view from the restaurant. At sundown they open up the sliding door and it feels like you are in some resort on vacation. You can then hear the water and it adds to the experience. The inside of the restaurant is elegant and very clean looking. I love the light colors. Such a great ambiance for a special occasion.   I had the bone in rib eye and it was the best rib eye I can remember having in years, loved it! For the sides we shared a Au Gratin potatoes which usually doesn't excite me but this one was the best I've had with gruyere cheese in it. Creamed spinach was great. We also got the black truffle creamed corn which was very unique and delicious. For a starter I got the Caesar Salad and it was nothing special. Desert was a molten chocolate cake which was excellent and a ice wine the waiter suggested.   Service was great until the last 10 minutes when we were ignored when it came to getting the check and taking the payment. I was disappointed that I told them when I booked that it was my best friend's wedding anniversary and a special occasion and they did not bring them something that said Happy Anniversary. I do see it in the yelp pictures that they do this, so I don't understand how they overlooked this. Maybe they don't do that here or they forgot? They did mention her anniversary at check in though so they did know. It's always nice to get that to take pictures with and I was expecting that this expensive restaurant would do that.    Our night ended with seeing Steve Wynn himself enter the restaurant and go to the back room.   I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "The main reason why I gave SW there's stars instead of 2 was because the restaurant is stunning. No debate about it. It's beautiful and romantic on the inside, and the waterfall and shows are captivating and beautiful as well. We sat on the patio and loved the ambiance. The trees and water are just stunning. There's really no other words to describe how great the atmosphere was.  However, I would not return except for the beauty of the space. Primarily because the service is extremely slow and the food is not remarkable. We were a party of 2 and were there for over three hours - and not by personal choice. We didn't get our appetizer for over an hour after sitting down. After that every single course took another 30-45 minutes to get. It was insane. They'd clear our plates promptly when we were done but the food just wouldn't come out. I'm assuming it's a kitchen issue, not service.   The service was good, but hard to come by at the same time. When our menus were shut they'd come and take our order, when our water was empty they would fill it. But there was twice we needed our server and they wouldn't come by. We watched them standing by server stations, but they just stood there. Being that we aren't the type to wave across a restaurant it was a little frustrating trying to get the server to come by. They were friendly and helpful with the menu once they had come by though.   The last reason why I'm only giving three stars is that it was our anniversary and it was never acknowledge. Nobody said happy anniversary, there was no anniversary dessert, nothing. We told the reservationist twice so it was pretty disappointing not to have it acknowledged.  We ordered the snake river strip, 9 oz filet and the dry aged bone in strip. The dry aged strip had a mild flavor of dry aging so if you're curious to try a dry aged steak it's a good option cause it's not overly potent. The filet was good. I ordered it with a char and they did a great job of creating a crust. For sides we did spinach, corn and au gratin. The corn was the best part of the meal. It was almost like the consistency of grits, but with a sweet corn and truffle flavor. They were great. For dessert we had the molten cake and the cake was fantastic. I didn't love the grand mariner ice cream though.",

However, I took a group of 9 people for dinner and although the servers themselves were great the service was incredibly slow.  I ordered a NY strip, my go to steak, it was terrible, arrived cool, it was so tough it was difficult cut, chewy, not even close to what I would expect at a top end steakhouse.  I gave up on it, barley eating 1/4.  Looking around the table no one finished their meal.  We still had a great time with lots of good wine, but the dinner itself needed much improvement.    Sorry for the poor review, I expected so much more.",

The weather was just perfect, the perfect lighting, and the entertainment above the water was so fun, it was like the extension of the La Reve we saw before the dinner... First of all the bread basket was so yum, so I didn't order any appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared Chateaubriand, side of mushrooms, cream spinach, asparagus and brussel sprouts for the table, this steak was the most tender, one of the best steak ever! All the sides were delicious too. My friends did not have a steak but they said their food was delicious as well. At last, the dessert Rocky road was so cool, nobody expected to come like it did like magic! I will definitely go back next time I take a Vegas trip! And this place is definitely the best steak house in Vegas! Great job Steve Wynn!",

They were on point and did everything expected and more, they are a True 5/5 so thank you for our experience because that is still something. The two stars are for you.   But to be a steakhouse out of all of the things you need to get right, steak is the first one. My filet was over charred leaving a burnt taste every time I ate a piece, the servers did switch our steaks, either that or the chefs do not know the difference between medium rare and medium. This is truly one of the worst steaks I have ever had.  The steak was dry, and lacked actual seasoning, and man it was so hard to cut! I enjoyed the seafood spectacular, my boyfriend did not, he just was not impressed. The wine was good, and the mash potatoes were awesome. The server noticed I didn't enjoy it and offered to replace it with something else, I declined and he kindly removed it from the bill.   I really wanted to like this place, my boyfriend and I don't mind paying for service, food, and experience. But for over 300, I expect a good steak.",

    "text": "I'll just come out and say it: this was one of the fanciest dining experiences of my life.  Now, I'm no high roller, but when you go to Vegas you have to splurge a bit. That's part of the experience. One of my old friends actually works here and suggested we all eat here, so we did.  Don't go walking in with flip flops and some jorts, either. This is a nice place. You can wear jeans and a polo, but anything else might be frowned upon. The tables are numerous, and they're all covered in white tablecloths. The room itself is quite elegant.  It's one of those places where three different servers will come to your table at one time: one guy brings the bread, another pours your drinks, and the other brings you the seafood platter -- which, for a solid $100, is awesome (jumbo shrimp, crab, oysters, lobster, three different sauces).  For dinner I HAD to get the filet, so I did. It was certainly one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life... I'd put it in my top three. It was so tender yet so juicy, and the sauce served with it makes my mouth water from 2,000 miles away. We all split different dishes too: mac and cheese (a nice twist and a very rich cheese taste); brussel sprouts; potatoes au gratin and steak tartar. Every side was scrumptious. Yes, you pay a lot but the portion sizes and the quality of the food is just amazing. We even split a piece of cheesecake for fun at the end, and that too was out of this world good.  Yes, it is pricey. My girlfriend's 24-ounce beer cost around $40. But again, it's Vegas and you're eating at Steve Wynn's steakhouse. The staff is great; they joke around with you but are very prompt on all the food and drinks. They will even take pictures of your group if you request it. Also, I was told Wynn himself is a vegetarian, so the menu has numerous veggie options.  It was one of those meals I will remember for a long, long time. I ate a lot, spent a lot, laughed a lot and had an overall great time with friends and significant others.",

We had to pour our own wine; something we do not expect to go given the prices of the wine. My fiance and I's NY strips were bland and difficult to cut.

It was my wife's birthday and we were going to drop some serious $$$ trying their True Kobe beef steak (estimated bill of $600 after the additions). We arrived only to be told we couldn't bring our 10 month old in. Mind you, she's on the verge of falling asleep and our reservation was at 9:30 (they close at 10:00). So basically they didn't seat us just because of a baby when the restaurant is emptying out. Pretty ridiculous. As if a 5-year old (their age limit) is better behaved than a sleeping baby would be.  Well good. We won't be spending our money with that hotel or steakhouse. Just a stupid policy for a restaurant to have and it cost them tonight.",

From perusing through the menus, this one seemed to be the best for my fiance's liking.   First off, and restaurant and ambiance are fantastic. We had early reservations right when they opened so we got seated right by the water. Unbeknownst to us, there's water lights shows throughout the evening. As expected, staff is first rate and very friendly.   Vegan bread and butter to start, which were good. I still eat dairy, so I tried their other assortments which were delectable.   Our waiter went to verify with the chef on whether or not the crab cake was vegan, and came back with a very detailed response. The breadcrumbs weren't vegan, but we ordered it anyway. 4.5/5 very good.   I ordered the domestic wagyu New York strip. Cooked to perfection and the best steak I've ever had.   Ordered some vegan sides to share with my fiance: whipped potatoes (vegan sour cream) and black truffle cream corn. Both were great, but in particular the truffle corn.   Fiance got the chick'n ravioli which she said was very good. Looked small, but at $26 she could've gotten 4 when compared to the price of my steak!   It's amazing to find and restaurant where I can order steak and my fiance something vegan that isn't just a salad. Top it off with phenomenal service and ambiance, you've got a winner here.",

In fact, it does not taste like alcohol at all. I ended up drinking 3! Oops.   Also, I would really recommend their seasonal specials.Last time I was here in December, the snow crab claws were AMAZING. Unfortunately, they were not in season this time. However, we tried the truffle gnocchi was was equally tasty and also the truffle salt steak carpacchio which also blew my mind!   We also tried their famous chili rub steak this time, however, the meat was a little over-cooked. My boyfriend loved it but I thought it was just okay.   ONE LAST THING - get the Rocky Road for dessert. This comes out in a chocolate sphere and the server will pour a hot syrup over the sphere and the ice cream inside will reveal. It was delicious and really cool.   Reservations are hard to get so make sure you make them in advance. The outdoor seating is so amazing.",

I ask the representative over the phone if she need me to pay for the cake over the phone and she was very clearly that I will pay it together with my bill. So as I expected and the end of the dinner an hour ago I'm waiting for the cake I order and the person that serve us gave me a desert menu. As I got a bit confused I got up to him and ask him to look at my reservation notes. After few minutes he came back to the table with this embarrassing few balls of chocolate!!!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTING AND EMBARRASSING!!!! I went to talk to the manager and the response I got from her was that the cake is pending and she doesn't really have anything to do with that!!! From a high hand place as this and for what you paying over there you looking for a little bit more of respect at least for the manager. I will highly recommend not going there!!!!!",

First off, we had to wait 10 minutes just to be seated at our table (even with a reservation). Given there was a crowded entryway in the restaurant, I could forgive this if it were not for the service to follow. It took 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive and an hour just to take our orders. It would have taken even longer had I not been tracking the waiter down with my eyes and giving her meaningful looks to come over to our table. Basically, my party of 6 had to wait ~1.5 hours for any food to hit our table.  The food itself was great but didn't blow me away compared to other steakhouses. I had the Tuscan Kale salad and the bone-in rib eye. The ambiance was entertaining with the waterfall show and we were seated outside as per my request.  Everything but the service met my expectations. But for the price of the food, that kind of service is just inexcusable. I love the Wynn but not this restaurant.",

Service goes without saying because when you pay 60-70 dollars for a ribeye you expect the service and presentation to be great so I can't consider this as a value added.    Of course what I can critique is the steak.  I got the bone in Ribeye and only the first bite (near the fat before the marbled portion) was succulent. With each successive cut the ribeye began drying up in my mouth.  Typically I judge a good ribeye from the first to last bite being oozing w/ juiciness--not the case here.  The sides left much to be desired.  Nothing special and nothing that can't be found at a buffet.  Winelist was good, again was expected when you're spending this kind of money.  $144 was my total tab and I have to say that  1) STK 2) Craftsteak 3) Vic & Anthony's   Will all be a better \"Tasting\"/Dining experience.",

    "text": "Mixed performance that falls short of expectations.  First the good: the domestic kobe beef steak was excellent and perfectly grilled. A wonderfully complex, savory and creamy delight. Same for the fois gras, and accompanying veggies. The molten chocolate cake with ice cream was an exquisite study in contrast with just the right amount of tartness. Interior decor was up-to-par for this class of restaurant.  Now the bad: the noise level was so high that we could hardly carry a conversation, the steak fries were undercooked and over-fried (i.e. too crisp outside and hard inside - as though the potatoes weren't parboiled with the cook then compensating by letting them fry extra long), and generic pop music is not a wise choice for this caliber of restaurant. I don't really want Maroon 5 with my kobe beef. Lastly, one of the servers picked a used napkin off the chair and placed it on top of one of the plates. Read: took a used napkin off a chair that probably wasn't disinfected beforehand, and then placed it on a plate from which we were going to eat desert.  Given the aspirations of SW, it falls short for this class. So, yes, in this genre, we've had better. Management may wish to study Wing Lei upstairs, for they have got \"it\" down to an art.",

We had reservations and were seated promptly after we arrived.   The bread basket was amazing. It included bacon and cheese muffin looking bread, pretzel bread and small baguettes. It was accompanied by butter topped with Hawaiian sea salt. Great presentation even better execution. You have to try the bacon cheese bread, it was SOOO good!   I ordered the New York strip topped with bleu cheese. I ordered it medium rare, it was cooked perfectly. The steak was super flavorful and extremely tender. I highly recommend the New York strip.    The sides were:  Au Gratin Potatoes: Very flavorful and rich. My only complaint is the portion size is so small. If you have more than three people sharing, order two.   Crisp Potato Rosti w/ chive cream: Skip this one, it was like a giant tater tot. No one at the table was very impressed  Poblano & Smoked Bacon Mac n Cheese: This side was really good. Not the best mac n cheese I've ever had but, it was really good.   Roasted Jumbo Asparagus: You have to order at least one healthy side, right? Well it was healthy until they bathed the asparagus in butter. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but no where near healthy.   Dessert: We ordered the funnel cakes. They were displayed beautifully. The funnel cakes themselves where extremely crispy. I like my funnel cake like I like my woman crispy on the outside and warm and delicious on the inside.... wait what? The dipping sauce were great except for the chocolate. I don't know what they put in it, but it was horrible. I'd skip the funnel cakes next time.   Service was really good, a couple of times our waitress was M.I.A. but, our drinks were never empty and our empty plates never stayed on our table.   All in all, this place is great and we will be coming back. If you are in town, give it a whirl.",

    "text": "$$$$!  As good of a steak you can find without going into the astronomical price ranges - at 62 dollars for a bone-in ribeye, you definitely get an amazing slab of meat. And the bone here is not really an issue. The marbling, texture, and flavor are all top notch. There's a reason why this place is brutally busy on weekend nights!  The meal opens up with a nice little bread basket featuring bacon and cheese bread, pretzel bread, and a standard french baguette. It's served with delicious sea salted butter that's too good to not slather all over the bread. Both the bacon and cheese bread and pretzel bread are very tasty and the pretzel bread is notable for its texture.   As for appetizers, the ones we got are very good but didn't blow my mind. The chopped salad was refreshing but nothing outstanding. Same for the side dishes - I think the creamed spinach was my favorite. Neither the french fries, corn, nor mac and cheese were worth writing home about. I might recommend scalloped potatoes first and foremost.  But really you're coming here for the steak. And it's a really damn good one.  On a second visit here, I was able to try the cheese crusted colorado lamb chops - the lamb itself was absolutely top notch, but I felt there was a little too much emphasis on the cheese crust and not enough on seasoning the meat itself. Therefore, bites without cheese crust were a little bland. Still, I chalked that to a bit of preference as well.  We also got desserts our last time. I'd definitely reconsider the pavlova - I didn't like the textures so much, but it was a unique and well crafted dessert that contrasted with the creme brulee's and brownies with ice cream.  The restaurant itself is huge - people are quickly moving across the restaurant making it a bit of a bustle. One noticeable feature is the large waterfall and pool on one side of the restaurant. The first night we sat outside and had a great view - but the entertainment itself is really strange and eclectic and is in someways a distraction rather than a pleasing display. A singing frog, blue and red sex balls (they moan and have a baby), and freaky faces fail to add to the atmosphere. I get that it's \"art\" but bleh.  Another note worth pointing is out is service was generally good, if not a tad slow at times due to the busy nature of the restaurant. Still, they were very good about refilling drinks and recognizing when we were done with our food. Best of all, they were more than willing to take pictures for us in front of the water with nary a hint of disdain! :-D",

The cocktail prices were not excessive and made to order (I can tell if the servers are paying attention because I always start off with a Bombay Sapphire Martini, up, in a very cold glass, dry like the desert, with three (3) olives. If any part of that order is wrong it is usually an omen for the rest of the experience).    Because the weather outside was cold (in the low 50's) we were given the option of dining on the patio or inside.  Our party of six chose to dine inside.  I would like to point out that SW does not start with an automatic gratuity until the party size reaches eight (8) this was a nice surprise (even though our tips usually are higher).  Each of the meals was prepared to perfection and the service was outstanding.  My wife and I had the porterhouse for two and it was served resting on vegetables.  The table ordered a few sides to share that the amount of food was actually too much.  Some of our party ended taken food back to their suite.  The wine selection is sophisticated and complete (some of the accompanying prices are sophisticated as well).  Not everyone in our party was drinking wine so one of the spouses suggested to the waiter that they bring something out in the $100-$150 range.  The selection was excellent for our preparation.   I would recommend this dining experience to anyone who enjoys a great steakhouse.",

    "text": "I loved this restaurant! The service the food....all of it!   Let me start with the yummy bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal. Soft warm rolls speckled with bits of smoky bacon and butter served with their butter drizzled in olive oil and truffles. This was a great start! I love my carbs so when the bread is good I have high hopes for the rest of the dinner and I definitely was not disappointed :)  I started with the Crab Corn Chowder. So delicious! It was a generous serving served in a small crock pot. It was a smooth blend of creamed sweet corn with nice big chunks of crab meat. It had a slight spiciness to it but still mild where you just notice it. If I'm not mistaken it also had a small bit of a mild white cheese to top it off and a light garnish of parsley. So YUM!  For my main course I chose the pan seared Halibut. Cooked absolutely perfectly served atop a tomato relish/puree. The fish had this great outer crust simply seasoned with just salt and pepper and the inside evenly cooked, flaky and so moist and flavorful! The menu is a la carte so I also ordered the butter roasted fingerling potatoes (I do love my carbs!) as my side. Again simply seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic and roasted in butter till tender.   Finally, to top off the whole dinner they give you these absolutely delicious, chocolate truffles. My friend and I could swear that there was some type of flavoring in the chocolate but we were told that they were pure chocolate truffles, no flavorings added. Sooo very YUM!  The whole staff was very attentive, but not overly bothersome, prompt, very friendly and courteous.   I had a great time and a fabulous meal, I would definitely visit again!",

Medium rare was perfectly executed.  The only downside were the sauces, the white (SW) one was okay, and the rest were inedible.  But, I went for the steak and not for the sauces.  The bread was also excellent, and the sides were fantastic (creamed corn and yukon potatoes).    The atmosphere was wonderful.  Definitely go after dark.  The waterfall is so beautiful with different lightly, giving it a romantic and beautiful atmosphere.  Also, sit outside on the patio if you can.  Cost is approximately $100 per person, but my steak was worth every cent!",

The one thing I didn't like was how the tables were all so close to each other. The restaurant is pretty big but not roomy. Our server was great, he knew how to crack jokes which kept the mood more lively.   Me and the bf both ordered the ribeye which came in a pretty big portion. Although it was missing a little flavor. There wasn't anything special about it so it was just average. I wanted dessert but we were just too stuffed from the steak. I def. regret that! Although our waiter knew it was our anniversary so he brought out a plate with some chocolate and on the plate it said \"Happy Anniversary\". That was sweet and it seriously made my night.

There is only one dry aged steak here, the baseball cut ribeye.  Everything else is wet aged.  Really, wet aged?  That is basically telling me you just left it in the bag for 30-40 days.  You can tell by the flavor and coloration of the meat.   It's fancy and nice ambiance, but there are alot of nice steakhouses in Vegas with nice ambiance.  Best steak ever.... far from it.  I did have a good time though.    Oh and by the way the side dishes were average at best.  Put this all together and that's why it gets a 3 in my book.  They do cook the steaks well though so that helps (for those who think I'm just bashing).",

    "text": "This place is located inside the Wynn hotel right on the Lake of Dreams.  I guess that isn't too hard to figure out seeing that SW=Steve Wynn.  Anyway, my wife and I decided to eat here on our last night in Vegas.  It is a very nice and classy restaurant.  I would consider it to be kind of a hip steakhouse as well.  My wife and I each ordered the 9 ounce filet ($54 each).  I ordered mine medium rare and it was cooked perfectly, while my wife ordered her's medium well, and it was well past well done when she got it.  So, they brought her another filet which was only cooked medium.  My wife ended up liking her filet, but the waiter was nice enough to take it off the bill due to the incorrect temperature.  We ordered the au gratin potatoes as a side($12), and had a caesar salad beforehand (around $12), both of which were very good.  The best part of our meal was the dessert.  We ordered chocolate creme brulee, which was outstanding.  As I mentioned before, this is a steakhouse inside the Wynn hotel, so don't be shocked by the high prices.  It's Vegas after all.  I would say the steaks and accompaniments were very good here, but I honestly thought the steaks at the Capital Grille across the street were better.  Either way, we enjoyed the meal here and our server was great.  We'll be back if staying here again and in the mood for a steak.",

The location, view, decor and atmosphere of this place is perfect. My table had a partial view of the outside, and it was so beautiful and serene. The changing of the light colors outside by the trees is a nice touch.  Not sure if my friend who made the reservations was drunk or if there was some miscommunication, but we had 9 people for dinner. They had us for reservations for 8 people. I was worried there would be some big inconvenience, but they immediately moved us over to a larger table that could accomodate the extra guest. The manager even shook my hand to say it was no big deal. The service was excellent and courteous. Always had my water refilled and another drink when needed.  I was pretty full from a late lunch that I had, so I didn't eat anything before  my entree besides the bread which was really good actually. For my entree I had the Bone In - NY steak. It was cooked perfectly. I savored every bite. We also ordered some side dishes for the table - asparagus was ok, the creamed truffle corn was excellent, au gratin potatoes were tasty and the creamed spinach was delicious. Little touches like having all the waiters come by and place everyone's entrees down at the same time are a nice touch. The waiters were all friendly but one guy was encouraging us to buy some shots but we were all drained from the night before.  I will definitely come here again, this place is great for parties of all sizes, and if you bring a date I would definitely ask for the table outside with the view of the waterfall.      Hopefully you can win some $$$ playing blackjack so your dinner will be free, otherwise it may be a little pricey but worth every benjamin =)",

My group of 6 was luckily able to get a last minute reservation for a Saturday night and we even got a table partly facing the Wynn's beautiful waterfall. Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable as we asked a slew of questions about food choices.   Appetizers: I ordered the sauteed foie gras with grilled pineapple, brioche toast and blackberry jam. The foie gras MELTED in your mouth. The blackberry jam at first seemed an odd choice with the foie gras, however it added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish.  Main course: I shared the 20 ounce bone in rib eye steak with another person...and yes I stole the piece with the bone (which definitely had the sweeter meat on it). The rib-eye was cooked medium rare JUST as I had requested. It was lightly charred on the outside and juicy on the inside. No one dared try the spicy chili and garlic garnish! I'm sure it was great.   We ordered the Black truffle creamed corn, parmesan creamed spinach, and the gold potato puree as sides and each were delicious.. favorite was the black truffle corn. The truffle wasn't overbearing.  Last but not least, we ended with the chocolate souffle. The homemade ice cream and cherries were to die for.   Perfect end to a great trip in Vegas. I will definitely be going back to this restaurant the next time I'm there so I can try the seafood!",

Every time I go to Vegas, whether I'm with friends, family, or business, I have always made IT a point to eat at SW. After this experience, I won't ever go back.  The Four Seasons made an early reservation around 6pm with a request to have a table with a view for my party. When my mother and I arrived, we were greeted by a hostess. She takes us to our table and it faces the kitchen. We asked if we could sit on the patio and she states \"It's all booked\"  SW has a big patio dining area - There were only two couples on the patio at the time. I stated, \"So all those tables are going to fill up within the next hour and half?\"  She ignores me and takes us back to the hostess stand..... Here is where we meet the ASS - Brad. My mother tells him The Four Seasons called and we requested a view of the lake. He answers my mother in a rude, arrogant, tone, \"I have over 700 hundred guests to seat tonight. The table we sat you in, is the only one available\".  I was pissed. Don't talk to my mother that way and frankly I don't give a damn how many people you have to seat.   An hour and a half latter, only half the tables on the patio were filled.  The restaurant was pretty empty but then again, it was early. We left at around 8:30pm.   The servers were nice and accommodating for the most part.  The food was good but not spectacular like I remembered (been dining here for the past 4 years) and the mac and cheese was a little rich. They use to have crab meat or lobster and instead they had gross chunks of bacon (not crispy bacon either).  When you pay top dollar, (SW is super pricey) you should be treated nicely and the food should always be amazing.",

The shrimp cocktail and tuna ceviche appetizers were enjoyed by all of us, and the crabcakes were phenomenal- probably the best I've ever had. And then those complimentary biscuits with the bacon bits in them? Oh man. Best free bread on the planet.   The sides were also delicious as usual...the au gratin potatoes being the best, followed by the mushrooms, mac and cheese, sauteed spinach, and finally the onions and jalapenos.   Two of our main courses, on the other hand, were prepared wrong. One friend ordered her steak medium rare and it was served not even rare, but raw. She lost her appetite and instead of having them cook it a little longer, just sent it back. Another friend ordered her steak medium and it was served well-done. They took one of them off our check, but not both. And for the love of God, what is so difficult about a dirty martini, straight up, served in a regular glass (not a martini glass)? The server got it wrong not once, but twice!  Three out of four ain't bad I guess, but I expected better. It could have been an off-night, but with all the amazing restaurants in Vegas, I may not return. If I do, I will probably eat some biscuits and crabcakes and then leave and go to Carnevino to order steak and martinis.",

    "text": "I want to start by telling you that SW Steakhouse is in a league of its own!  The wonderful time and food will remain tattooed on your brain and taste buds and you'll want to go back for more the very next day.  My husband and I have been to SW about half a dozen times and the experience and food never disappoint.  SW provides an out of this world dining experience with high quality food and service, and entertaining shows on the Lake of Dreams, all so very Las Vegas.  So, you're definitely in for a treat!   The ginormous 42 ounces Chile Rubbed Double Rib Eye is the most tender and succulent piece of meat my palate has ever been graced with.  And don't get me started on the amazing flavors that the chile rub gives the meat.  And then there's the Black Truffle Creamed Corn.  I can't rave enough about this side dish.  This scrumptious creamed corn is a perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess, while the truffles bring elegance and earthiness without being overpowering.  Simply decadent!    Feel free to check my full review to learn more about SW Steakhouse and the other 6 exquisite dishes and drinks with pictures that we've ordered during our many visits to SW, such as Steve's Chopped Salad, Corn Soup (from the Vegan menu), or Bigeye Tuna Ceviche to name just a few:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsimplyromanesco.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F07%2Fsw-wynning-steak.html&s=b3ec0f12cd62a8857d31b2da6f9b1b1cf230644da89e49d8fcb7b62b0e40bd52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">simplyromanesco.blogspot...</a>",

    "text": "Four Star review for ambiance and service, three stars for the food and the prices. The Wynn is a lovely hotel, and dining on the patio was great. The service was attentive without being intrusive.  Echoing other reviews, this is a straight up steakhouse, with the exception of some special menu items found at higher end restaurants like foie gras, caviar and fresh seafood by the pound.   I started with a beet salad, which was good, but pretty expensive for the portion and simple preparation. We planned to order two different types if steak and share.   I ordered the bone in rib eye, which was good, but not amazing. It was properly cooked, but under seasoned and less than I expected, considering the beef was prime.   My husband ordered a small fillet, which was overcooked. As huge steak fans, I am always shocked when this happens. The one place you should be able to expect your meat to be prepared properly is at a steakhouse, especially a prime steakhouse. Although we considered eating the overcooked meat, given the $54 price tag on the 6 ounce filet, we decided to send it back. Although the second filet was closer to what we asked for, it arrived undercooked. Since we were on our way to a show, we didn't have time to deal with it any further and ate the second steak. Again, although it was pretty good, it was not the best steak I've ever eaten.   My favorite part of the meal was the pretzel bread with the Hawaiian sea salted butter- and sitting near the lake/water feature.   This place is lovely if you're dining with someone that has an expense account, or for a special occasion.",

    "text": "SW is no steakhouse. It is an excellent restaurant that serves steak. HUGE difference between the two. Lots of pro's and reasons to go to SW especially if you are lucky enough to get seating out doors. The ambiance is relaxing and beautiful as the waterfall is not only peaceful it serves as the back drop from mini shows done by a giant mechanical frog and glowing balls (hard to explain) among other things.   As far as the food goes, I don't have any complaints outside of the steak. The oysters and crab cakes were very good. The side dishes, especially the potatoes au gratin, were spot on. The desert was nice. But my biggest gripe was the steak. 11 guys went and a majority of us ordered the bone-in-ribeye to be cooked medium. Each one seemed to have a different color. My steak came out medium well and was very tough. The char and crust on it were great. Had it been a little more tender I would have kept it. Any how I sent it back and asked for it be a legit medium. My next steak came out and it was medium rare. It was still very tough. The meat just seemed low quality to be honest and I barely put a dent in it. I was very surprised bc everything was good up to that point. I don't know if it was an off night or my standards for steak are just real high considering Gibsons in Chicago has done it right every time I've been. Or maybe the ribeye isn't their best dish. My crowd didn't seem as unimpressed as I was, but they did agree the steak was nothing special.   Anyhow, if and when I go back to Vegas, I'd consider going back to SW for drinks and maybe a light dinner, but I would order something other than the steak.   Quick note on service. It was decent. A little slow at times but it was a big group.",

I like that when you walk into this place it doesn't feel like other $$$$ in Hollywood or LA, less pretentious, still fun, but more mature.   The waiters were attentive, on point, never missed a thing. Everyone ordered the classic Caesar to start with, I especially liked the baked parmesan stick.  For sides we had the sauteed mushrooms, creamed corn, au gratin potatoes, and creamed spinach this is also my order of preference.  They were all really great but the mushrooms and creamed corn were my favorite! I had the Asparagus risotto for dinner (I don't really even like rice that much), and it was SO GOOD, I literally ate till I could not breathe. The rest of the table had a variety of NY, Bone in rib eye, and chicken plates which they all raved about. Overall it was an amazing experience, the bill for 5 of us came up to about $600, including 8-10 drinks.",

This place is just another pricey steakhouse - Maybe I'm just over the whole steakhouse... Thing.  Unless they can bring something new to the table, it all seems just played out to me.

We were seated right by the lake which was a great way to start our meal. The bread basket came with pretzel bread, banquette, and the yummy cheesy bacon bread which was an ultimate favorite.  We started out with the seafood spectacular which included, two types of oysters, lobster, crab, jumbo shrimp and king crab legs. The seafood was fresh and very fulfilling. Hubby and I shared the dry aged tomahawak chop (Rib eye) with a side of truffle cream corn. The steak was cooked to perfection; juicy, medium and char on the outside goodness. Although I tasted the truffle in the corn, i didn't see anything special about it.   To end our night, we ordered the peanut butter banana chocolate crunch (i think that is the full name). If you like the combination of  peanut butter and bananas, you will love this. The way they made the banana into a mousse, the peanut butter crunch at the bottom and then topped it off with chocolate...oh my amazing!  We had a two hour dining experience and to conclude the evening, we saw the singing frog made the evening more memorable.",

    "text": "SW makes the best steak in Vegas.  Kind of a bold statement for a guy who's eaten at dozens of the best rated steakhouses across the country, and probably dozens in Vegas alone. An even bolder statement for a city known for luxury, extravagance and world class restaurants, particularly its steakhouses.  I went with very low expectations. I love the Wynn and all, but not for its food (can we say most overrated buffet?). But we had some rooms here, and the SW was chosen out of convenience. It was also one of the few my buddies and I hadn't tried yet. The reviews I read were positive, but not gushing which isn't good for a town over-saturated with five star reviews. I was warned about cheesey water-light shows with giant frog puppets. The pictures I saw her on Yelp didn't show me dishes that looked to be particularly special. To be honest I tried to lead my friends over to CUT which had been spectacular on a previous trip. But I relented. And thank God I did.  There was a wait so we grabbed a couple of Macallan's at the bar. And we waited.  Our table gets called and I walk into a giant dining area. It's reminiscent of a giant ballroom with giant glass windows on one side giving a view of said frog puppet show. I wasn't impressed. The decor was less than promising. It didn't scream hip like N9NE, nor sexy and dark like CUT or craftsteak. It looked like the restaurant tried to go for a posh elegance look, but got tired half way. Not a promising start.  Then the food began to come out.  Fantastic. Start-to-finish.   For bread they give you cheesy bacon bread, as if they thought you might not get enough meat during your meal. It was so deliciously salty and fluffy and different. We asked for more than one basket.  The steak I chose was a bone-in rib eye, my go-to cut about 90% of the time. I know when it's good and when it's just alright and this was toe-curling, eyes-in-the-back-of-the-head orgasmic. Perfect sear and crust on the outside. Perfectly medium rare on the inside. It's honestly difficult to get this just right so I usually err on the side of rare+ in case it comes out overcooked. This was medium rare done right, where the meat has the slightest crunch on the outside and almost melts with every bite, gushing with flavor with each bite.  Most sides don't even get a mention in my reviews, but the black truffle creamed corn which we got on a server's recommendation was amazing. I'd go back just for the corn alone. You cannot eat here without getting the creamed corn as a side. The mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes were pretty good too but not quite withdrawal-symptoms-inducing memorable.  As a male, red-blooded American, it is my God-given honor to eat right meat. It's almost a duty, given the forefathers who died to give me this freedom. I vote and I pay my taxes. God bless America and it's cattle industry. God bless the SW Steakhouse.  After awhile, the frog puppet thing kind of grows on you.",

    "text": "As usual, my hubby planned a Valentines dinner for us 5 days before Valentine's day to avoid the cheesy-Valentines crowd. We like to be just a few of the cheesy bunches on these date-night infested fine dining spots. Our first time coming down the escalator for these lake side restaurants. My first impression was how gorgeous the view was. The main dining room in this steakhouse was nice, warm, simple, and posh.   My husband had called a couple nights before trying to reserve dinner out in the patio with the lakeside view. They did warn him that he may not get it because people have reserved them months before. Sure, fine.   We get there, greeted, denied the patio for the same reason. Sure, fine. We'll take any seat you have available on a Saturday night (5 days away from Valentines). My husband was pretty irritated because it was only 5:30pm and the whole patio was empty. He literally wanted to leave lol. But I was hungry and wanted us to have a good time regardless. Btw, the guy working at the reservations check-in booth was a dick and half about it too.   Our waiter, however, was kind and helpful. We shared a steak cooked to medium. This tasted well. Flavorful, juicy, and well-charred. We also shared some king crab legs. This was good, but nothing bone-shaking. Our sides were mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms. Mushrooms tasted and paired well with the steak. Mash potatoes were, well mashed (nothing to woohoo about).   Come 6ish, and the patio was not even half way full. Around 6:30 or so, most people wanted to sit inside because the wind picked up a little. Kind of a blessing in disguise for us, but we are still pretty bummed that this whole patio thing ruined our overall impression and take of this place. They could have easily sat us both (only 2 people) somewhere out in the empty patio At 5:30pm and again around 6 and even around 6:30 when people wanted to move indoors. Funny how they can accommodate people back into the main dining room as they please because they were simply not as busy as they portrayed to be.   Because of this..... I can't even recommend my friends to this place, even if the food was decent enough. They'd probably get better treatment at another nice restaurant with a view in Las Vegas. This same rule applies to the patio dining at Prime in Bellagio, but we always seem to get the patio last minute anyway when they realize there is still some room for two more.",

The grilled octopus appetizer I had was bland & was so much better at Botero (before it closed).  Fennel mac & cheese was overwhelmingly fennel. Mashed potatoes & brussel sprouts were standard issue.  Recommendation: although you might be tempted, do not sit on the patio in the middle of summer! It was so hot that had to excuse myself several times to go inside just to cool down. Unfortunate because the view is so beautiful but it made the meal unpleasant. I couldn't wait to get out of there.  I would give it a go one more time solely based on the fact that I love all things Wynn.",

    "text": "If you're looking for big flavored, spicy steak along with a Vegas water show, this would be your place. It's a 5-star experience because it was immensely satisfying and unique.  We had the 42oz chili rubbed ribeye. It was unbelievably flavorful, be sure to get it cooked medium as medium rare would be too raw for a steak of this size. It was basically too much for 2 people, three would be the right number. I've never had a steak like this, and it's worth the trip. So juicy, so spicy, properly seared - just amazing. Six stars. If you're not into strong, spicy flavors then stay away from this one.  Roasted bone marrow appetizer - not bad at all, nicely caramelized on top, not normally my thing but it's good here. 4 stars.  Sides - we opted for fries, creamed corn, and mushrooms. All were good, the creamed corn was very rich and rather sweet (it was summer and therefore sweet corn season). You can't go wrong with any of these, but please, don't order all of the above for two people as it was too much food. 4 stars apiece.  We also had a couple of glasses of red wine - the house wine ($17) was okay, and the Rioja ($20) was zesty and just right for a strongly seasoned piece of meat - I recommend it. The rest of the wine list was moderately impressive in quality and frankly outrageously expensive, even by stratopheric Vegas standards. However, the above by the glass options were reasonable for Vegas so all is well. 4 stars here, too.  We were seated outside by the lake and waterfall, every half hour there was a music and automated prop show in the water. This was a lot of fun and a unique environment for a steak place. Service was typical high-end Vegas, attentive and prompt. 5 stars for the show and service.  Price - $270 for the above. Not cheap, but I actually expected worse and overall I am happy with the experience and my choice of SW Steakhouse for a nice night out.",

    "text": "Delicious? Yes.  Romantic? Yes.  Upscale? Yes. Worth the $$$? Maybe not so much.   The service and atmosphere here is great. Those two things are so important when it comes to your recall of a restaurant's experience.  Loved that there was a floor to ceiling window with the waterfall view. However, be advised that the water show doesn't start til 8:30.   Food came out very promptly. And I did enjoy the bread basket (a little too much) during the short wait (pretzel bread, why you gotta be so good?)  Shrimp scampi (5/10) - Probably my least favorite part of the meal. They used jumbo shrimp, which lacked juiciness. The flavor was also a bit bland yet was oily.  Maine Lobster (7/10) - Was surprised at how generous the portion was. But I do wish they put a little less seasoning (cheese, garnish, and whatnot) because it took away from the taste and made it pretty heavy.  Bone in ribeye (8/10) - Cooked to medium rare perfection! Tender and crispy. Seasoned well, although it could've used a little less salt.  Kobe wagyu (8.5/10) - Of course this was the best part of the meal. If it wasn't, there would be something very wrong. Juicy and buttery, melts in your mouth. Balanced flavors of sweet and savory for a steak. I did have a bit higher of expectations for it, as it was not very marbled. But, it was still very tasty.   Overall, this was a memorable meal. However, the seafood and ribeye steak quality were on par with steakhouses that are nearly half the price. And as good as the Kobe wagyu was, I've had better wagyu at a Japanese BBQ restaurant in California once .. I'll wait to try the real deal in Japan.  It was a good one time experience , but cost to quality ratio wasn't good enough to make me want to come back.",

    "text": "I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this place has disappointed me to a new level. I made reservations at 7PM months in advance in celebration of my wife's birthday. I even had a $100 arrangement of roses and lilies sent to the restaurant for a nice touch and a nice centerpiece to make this a special night for my wife.  As this was my wife's birthday weekend getaway, I was excited to go back to the SW Steakhouse because we loved the setup as well as the nice lake show that happens every few minutes. Upon arrival, we weren't greeted with smiling faces...Jessica along with the rest of the front desk ladies said with a distraught look to say, \"Were sorry, we can't take your reservation because you have a baby with you.\" I was livid. My baby just turned 2 months old, all he does is eat and sleep. We have NEVER been turned away of a reservation due to having a baby and we have ate at nice a handful of nice restaurants since he's been born. I made the reservation for 3 so the car seat can be placed on a chair or next to my wife in a booth. This place swears like the noise level is low and intimate, anybody that has been here knows it's loud and upbeat. We were at Mr. Chow the previous evening and the ambiance is much more quiet and intimate and they welcomed our baby with open arms constantly checking if we needed anything. I definitely won't be back here EVER again, nor recommend you guys to anybody. I appreciate SW Steakhouse for ruining a planned evening and birthday. Keep up the good work.",

I had a NY Strip that was good, not great. As Jack H. stated i his review which BTW I didn't read and wish I had, it was downright tough and while i ordered it medium rare it was more medium.    My mates had Filet's and both said they were good, not great.  We started the meal with cesars and there was nothing special about those either. The side were good, the creamed corn was very interesting and I would suggest that to anyone ordering sides.  If your on a corp expense account or your happen to  be a high roller this is a good place, however, if you asked me to choose between this and say Strip Steak or Smith and Woolinsky, it would be an easy choose.  The Wine list is very good but prepare for some very $$$$$ prices.",

Our server, Ryan, greeted us immediately and provided us with a wine and cocktail menu. I ordered a pink sangria and my bf got \"The Smash.\" I'm not a big whiskey drinker but the bf and I agreed that this was the smoothest whiskey and easy to take down. Shortly after we sat down we were given a complimentary assortment of bread. We tried each one but the pretzel bread was easily our favorite. I started off with a Caesar salad, which conveniently came out split into two plates so both myself and bf could enjoy it. We each got filet mignons for our entree and split the Au Gratin Potatoes. The filet was so tender that we barely had to use a knife to cut it. The potatoes were the right amount of cheesy with a crisp topping. As if we didn't eat enough already, we knew we needed to try a dessert. We decided to go with the half order of funnel cake and strawberries. The vanilla creme sauce was amazing and complemented the funnel cake well. I wish I could put the sauce on all desserts. Overall, this was one of the best meals I have ever had at a steakhouse. Thank you to Ryan for making this experience so wonderful!",

    "text": "SW treats you like royalty.  Upon check-in I asked for seating with a view of their waterfall, within less than a minute they had prepared side by side seating with an unblocked view of it. (++)  Service was astounding for the most part. Our actual server had a little grumpiness with him, but it didn't affect the wait or availability of the restaurant unknowns, so eh who cares. Our bus boy was the friendliest, he made you feel comfortable, just sit back and relax, he'll take care of things. (+)  Drinks- The ingredients are what separates these from other variations of the same drink. Details matter here, including the way in which you get intoxicated  Ultimate Margarita: Felt double shot, a cheery sipper. (+)  Mango Paloma: The best. You could easily taste the alcohol but the flavors beneath it soothed it out so well. (++)  Starters  Chopped Salad: Everything was fresh but they over did it with the dijon vinaigrette. It tasted like it had been washed in it. It wasn't ruined, but it made it stand out in the wrong way.   Grilled Octopus: I had a terrible version of it at The Lark (Santa Barbara) and so I was worried so much about it that I had to ask if it would actually taste like Octopus. He looked at me like I was crazy, but if he only knew. Anyways, yes this is what I expect when I order grilled octopus, lightly grilled taking out the deep oceanic taste, but leaving enough taste in it to savor it as a seafood dish. (+)  Steaks- both cooked to a perfect medium rare, avoid the sauces, the meat and the butter topping is enough.  9oz Filet: Tender, with a taste that stood behind what you'd hope to get from SW. Not the juices experienced from a bone-in but it matched the taste of the Mastro's. 4.25/5  24oz Bone-In Ribeye: I ran through this like a Saharan lion. One of the best steaks I have ever had. Food perfectionist me wishes it would of had slightly and I really mean slightly less fat but for a ribeye it's probably the best that you can get. The tenderness, the juices all in the flavor of every bite. I could not be distracted away from it. 4.8/5  Sides  Creamed Corn: You must order this. A rich creamy taste that you'll have trouble shaking yourself out of.   Au Gratin Potatoes: Another one. The warmness of the potatoes and the cheeses. I am not supposed to go heavy on the dairy, but SW is where you want to go all in.   I regret to inform you that I skipped on the dessert. I REALLY wanted their funnel cake, but after all of the above I really had no room. Plus I needed an excuse to come back.  After this experience, I would put SW up against any steakhouse, not just in Vegas but in the country. If you appreciate a good steak, don't disrespect yourself by going anywhere else.",

This, however, is what pushed good food to 5 stars. My son has an 'invisible' disability.  In few words, he does not have fine motor skill abilities on his left side.  He asked our server if they would cut the steak in the kitchen. Now usually this simple request is met with no. SW Steakhouse not only graciously agreed, but after being cut they pushed it back together so that his plate did not look different. THIS IS SO COOL!! When serving our sides, server discreetly asked if he would like the broccoli cut. So, THIS is Service. Thank you, SW Steakhouse, we WILL be back",

The atmosphere and ambiance is beautiful. We chose to sit outside which concerned me at first bc Vegas can be miserably hot during the summer months, but the water seemed to cool give a cool breeze. We had reservations and there was no wait to seat our party. Now on to the food. We were told that we should share the a la carte sides which we did and had plenty to go around for our party of 7. We ordered the Mac n cheese, creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes, veggies and I believe something else. We were also advised we could share the meat and they could cut it accordingly. We didn't listen and I regret that. We had tons of meat that went to waste as there is no refrigerator in the Encore rooms. They do char the meat but you can ask they go light on that which I did and my meat was perfect. This place isn't cheap but worth the experience.",

This is the restaurant I spend my money at when we go to Vegas and the experience is part of what makes this restaurant. When we went to check in they asked if we still wanted outside, I said absolutely and we waited about 10 minutes and they sat us in the very back of the restaurant. When we said we had asked to sit outside they said they were all booked. Totally would have been fine but had they told us when they checked us in. We are around 6pm and there were tables open outside the entire time we were there, just disappointing because that's one of our favorite places to go and it has special meaning for us. The food was still great, potato puree is amazing. For a $400 meal I wished there was better communication.",

As the time went by I've approached the hostess and asked to charge my bill to the room without bringing it to the table. She said not to worry and just to stop by before leaving to sign the bill. As we finished our desert the bill arrived at the table...after I specifically asked to hold on to it since I wanted to treat my guests and not to deal with paying in front of everyone. When I went back to the hostess and asked her why the waitress brought out my bill she could not explain it to me. All she said was I'm sorry. I think 5 star restaurant inside of Wynne hotel has to have better approach to the customers and grant them what they asked. Should I add that I was not happy??",

Everything was delicious, but the rib eye was the real star.  I would even go as far as saying that it was the best piece of meat I have ever tasted.  It was so tender and flavorful; the peppers and onions were grilled to perfection!    I hate that this steakhouse is in Vegas, so I'm not able to visit very frequently.  I am hoping they will open one at the Wynn Boston Harbor.",

I ordered mine medium rare. It came out medium, if not medium plus. My friend decided to let our waiter know that I was dissatisfied. All he did was stand above my head and tell me that it was how I ordered it....medium. But I had ordered medium rare!! No apology. No nothing. Fine.   Side dishes: nothing to write home about. Nothing stood out honestly. We didn't stay for dessert because the highlight of the meal thus far had been our salads. So we called it a night.   Simply disappointed with SW.

    "text": "We went to SW Steakhouse for a 40th birthday celebration and were overall disappointed (9 Dec).  The SW is clearly setup for fine dining.  The decor, layout, and quality material are top notch.  I was thrilled the restaurant listed a dress code, \"Business casual attire is required; shorts are not permitted and gentlemen must wear a collared shirt.\"  Upon entry it was clear that the dress code was not enforced.  Gentleman were wearing tee shirts, cowboy hats, and other attire that were anything but business casual.  We, a party of two, checked in before our 1800 reservation and were told it would be just a minute.  We went to the bar for cocktails.  The Manhattan was good, the Hendricks and tonic came with a lime (hint: cucumber.  The bartender should have asked for a preference).  At approximately 1818 we were sat.  Several parties arrived after us and were seated before we were.  Not a great start.  Our table was all the way in the back of the restaurant near the servers station.  Initially, I was very unhappy, but it turned out to be very private and I could observe the staff and clientele.  Our server Anthony was awesome, definitely the high point of the evening.  Very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly without being too familiar.  A+ for Anthony!  The food.  The bread basket was one of the best I've ever had.  Salads -- Caesar and Baby Iceberg both solid.  Main -- pepper crusted chateaubriand.  The meat was so tender and delicious except it had SO much pepper on it.  It was overwhelming and I had to scrape some of it off.  The beef tallow fries were a fail.  The were over cooked, dry and if I had to guess reheated/refried.  The Brussels sprouts with bacon were tasty.  We sensed that the bottom line for the restaurant was more important than the guest experience.  Let's face it, most guests (tourists) will not return, but we are Las Vegas locals.  I don't mind spending well over $300 for 2 people, but the total experience has to meet the price point.  Our search for our high end local steakhouse continues.",

Plus a bonus for the beautiful show that starts at 7pm right outside of the restaurant on the lagoon with a huge mesmerizing waterfall that you can see through the windows while dining or you can come out on the patio and enjoy it with accompanying music.  Recommendations as far as the food: Kale salad light and citrusy- delicious  Pasta with lobster and mushrooms - excellent  Black Sea bass light and full of flavor served with bok choy and tiny mushrooms  My husband had the steak and loved it. All their steaks are premium USDA meat and you can't go wrong here. We also tried the cream corn with black truffles as a side dish - terrific! Decided to go with martinis instead of the wine. The drinks were good,  strong enough and with good flavor. Skipped the desert but there were some good options to consider for the next time. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff makes every effort to make your experience unforgettable just like all of the restaurants of the Wynn and Encore Hotel. Will definitely come back,  again and again !",

Maybe she shouldn't have ordered fish at a steak house but I expected more from the flagship restaurant that bears the hotels name. It was almost as if someone just poured a can of tomatoes over the fish and called served it.   The three starts is more for the service than anything else.  Service was slow. They gave me a regular knife for my steak and not a steak knife.  They mixed up dishes and we had to tell them who had what.  And fish should always be served last and it wasn't.   Again the service was slow and we ended up being thirty minutes late for our show. We felt rushed at the end.   The pretzels bread is amazing and almost worth the  price of admission.",

I think I would go with the filet next time. We ordered three sides, Au Gratin potatoes, asparagus, and a gnocchi that was on special. The gnocchi was some of the best I've had, but it might be a little rich for some. A great dish to share. I didn't care much for the asparagus because the stalks were so big, they kind of felt underdone. The potatoes were pretty good, but tough to split with four people since the portion was a little small. The service was exceptional!",

Once we arrived we were informed that even though we had a reservation booked for outside, they would seat us inside due to others making reservations months ahead of time for the outdoor seating. There was plenty of room outside, so after 5 or so minutes they moved us outside.  My steak was mediocre at best. Slightly overlooked and not flavored how a well marbled ribeye should be. Pretty disappointing since I've had higher quality steaks from chain restaurants.  The service is what makes me give the SW one star. It took us about 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks. The waiter was inattentive and only made efforts to come by twice within the 3ish hours our party was there. We had to flag him down each other time in order to get water, cocktails, and order additional plates. Overall: Fun atmosphere, but a subpar steak and terrible service equates to a one-star review.",

    "text": "Just got back from Vegas and went with friends on the first night to SW for a patio dinner. Great tip for anyone requesting patio seating: make reservations in advance AND come at 5:30pm. Why? Because that is when they open. You can take your pick of tables on the patio if you wish. Perfect planning prevents poor performance. As we were leaving there was a group of young ladies complaining to the hostess why they are not able to sit on the patio WITHOUT RESERVATIONS. HHHMMMM. As I walked by them I just shook my head. I felt bad for the hostess having to put up with silly muppets in mini skirts, taking selfies in a restaurant they are complaining about. I guess they felt entitled. Oh well.  Anyway.....  the service is incredible and the food is delicious. If you want to go all out for a nice dinner in a fabulous hotel, just go to the SW Steakhouse. You won't be disappointed. I won't name names because that is bad karma, but I have gone to my share of \"other steakhouses in Vegas\" and I can tell some negative stories (Bellagio, get your act together guys!). I know there are people that give this place crummy  reviews but I understand, as well as everyone else should as well, that every circumstance comes with different outcomes. With that said, I've been here 4 times on 4 different trips and I am extremely pleased each time. (Add-on the Mac and Cheese side, oh man!)",

    "text": "worst restaurant I ever been!! if there is 0 start rating I will do 0! when we find this restaurant we have really high expect on it,  but the truth is so disappointed. we all order steak that night, so ask the server to pair a bootle of wine for us, and he bring one said he think it will go great with the steak, and open it ask us to TRY if we like it. OK here comes the problem, most of the restaurant I been to ( cheaper than is one or expansive than this one, both ) if you say you don't like it they ask me do you want to try something else right away. ( sometimes I keep sometimes I change just depend on how I really like the taste.) but the server turn his face right away after we said we think is too dry for us. He said if we let the wine decant a little bit will be fine and pour out the wine without ask us if we really want to take it! OK fine. if he feels return the wine is trouble then we take it.  But then we wait a long time to get our food like 30 mints for appetite and 40 mints for the steak. but the worst thing we mad is that people around us that sit down after us already finish their food when we got our food. and we taste the food and feels really sorry about it. it's not a food quality that should comes out from a high class restaurant. the only food that taste ok is the Bread Basket. thats all. other food is totally oily than any restaurant I ever try! not only the steak, its everything!! The Foie gras appetite is so high rating when I read some other review, but when I taste its just nothing that will give you surprise. we ask for to go boxes after we taste a little, cause don't want to wast time on the bad service and so so food. one of our friend is very mad and write down how she feel on the ticket. but no manager come to us and ask what happen, only the waiter come and said the wagu beef is suppose be marble and oily! sounds like we never try before! come on, the wagu beef originally come from Japan. of cause we know how it should taste. and also we try kobe and wagu  all over the place, there are so many restaurant doing lot better than them. we even try the wagu beef sashimi the other night at another restaurant in vegas. no one taste that worst like here!!! I feel really pity for the steak cause they wast a such good wagu steak. I won't said its the worst food I ever try but its worst service I ever got. we leave without hearing they say a words \"sorry\". they are racist I think! cause other white people since been treat very well. so if you are not a white people do not go there to spend so much money and get bad food and worst service. one of my friend said that normal in vegas cause the server get their tips so easy, thats for sure, expecially the restaurant is in Wynn. but if you are truly a high class restaurant that you will train your server to treat every one the same way, the good way! they do not respect you as a customer.",

    "text": "Try it at least once.  Best to make reservations.    We were fortunate to dine overlooking the waterfall.  In the evening there is an amazing bouncing ball light show.  My husband loved his filet.  It was seared and looked like a present.  My scallops were beautiful.  I would have liked salt and pepper on the table.  I am sure our attentive waiter would have been happy to add cracked pepper to my meal.  But, in this restaurant all I could think about is the chef coming out and screaming at me in french like in the I LOVE LUCY SHOW when Lucy asked for Ketchup at a French restaurant.  So I just ate my fish,after all this is a steakhouse.  The scalloped potatoes were the best I have ever had.  They should be for the price they are charging.  Just sayin'  I think (hard to remember) we also order the spinach which we enjoyed.  The best part of the meal (seriously) was their bread basket with their signature seasoned butter.   When in town I am going to just get their bread to go!  :)  As far as dress code ~This is supposed to be the BEST steak house in town.  Yes, the food and service is similar to the Ritz BUT you would NEVER see jeans at dinner in the Ritz.   Would we dine here again?  I think it would be a good idea for Mr. Wynn to offer discounts to his guest who stay at his hotel~ At least a free appetizer or drink.",

    "text": "I read all the reviews about how awesome the Wagyu is so naturally I had to splurge for my birthday. I'd never had Wagyu and I've always wanted to try it. We made a reservation, arrived early and had to wait to be seated until the reservation time. We were seated outside and had a nice view of the water show there, which was a nice touch.  First off, they only had the option of either rib eye or rib cap. I made reservations with the intention of ordering tenderloin, so that was a real bummer.  But, we were only available that night so I went for the rib eye. We also ordered the Ohmi and 3 sides: mushrooms, creamed corn, & mashed potatoes and 2 drinks, which ended up being way too much food and we had a lot of leftovers, but didn't even end up eating them after taking them to go.  The best surprise of the night was the free bread that was served, we ordered seconds and so glad we did because it was amazing! We're not that crazy about bread but this one had bacon and cheddar in it. Mmmm!  The Ohmi NY Strip was probably better than the Wagyu Rib Eye, which was ordered medium rare and tasted like nothing special, definitely not worth the $220 exorbitant price tag! The Ohmi was $180 and although it was a bit of a better \"deal\"... it still definitely was also not worth the price. Also, it was ordered \"blue\" but served more like medium rare.  Apparently, the chef cooks the steak to whatever he thinks is appropriate rather than the way you order it! lol. They did give me a free dessert for my birthday, so that was a nice touch. It was a macaroon plated by being \"glued\" to the plate by some chocolate---this made for a messy eating, especially since no utensils were served--tisk, tisk. But, alas, this was complimentary so I really shouldn't be complaining, right?  Service was ok. But, not excellent. If you're paying such a steep price, your water should be refilled before you get to the bottom, bread crumbs should not be visible on the table, etc. This was not the case. If this were just a regular steakhouse, let's say at a quarter of SW's price tag, perhaps this review would have a higher rating, but I was oh so disappointed. I expected an extraordinary evening that excited my senses and instead I got a mediocre night--nothing special. And it was my birthday! :(   Yes, I groupon and like to find good deals for everything, but I also don't mind splurging ...ifff it's worth it. So I took a gamble.  A party of 2 for a total of $550 plus tip, totally not worth it! I guess I gambled in Vegas... and lost! ;(  P.S. There was a couple seated 2 tables down from us and they were smoking towards the middle of our dinner... this made an already mediocre night, pretty horrible, as all we tasted was smoke!  They should definitely make separate smoking and non smoking sections where you 100% can't smell the smoke.  We definitely will not be returning.",

The restaurant does not offer a list of their wines anywhere though. We explained this to our waiter, the som, and the manager. We were told is such a matter of fact and even rude manner. We were extremely disappointed and ended up leaving without a meal.",

It came out a little rare for my liking, but I figured it would be ok. The absolute driest steak I have ever had. Only ate a couple of bites. The waiter asked if I wanted him to box it up to take home. I told him no way. He asked me if it was good. I replied not at all. He immediately asked if it was too dry. Seemed like he knew. He said he would let the chef know, but that was it. Very very disappointed.     After posting this review I realized they did take my steak off our ticket which was a nice gesture. They also have reached out to me in an attempt to make things better. I appreciate both of those gestures. Nothing is always perfect. I'm going to up my review from 1 star to 3 star. I appreciate their concern, and desire to make things right.",

We ordered a side dish of Sardinian Gnocchi which was under seasoned despite the fact it had grated black truffle and lobster. When the waiter asked how everything was and I told him it seemed like the gnocchi was under seasoned he was a bit snooty and put off in his offer to take it back. I ordered the bone-in ribeye which I ordered medium. It, as well as all the steaks that came to our table, came out charred on the outside which made it a bit tough. I wasn't expecting fork tender but for a $72 bone-in steak at a renowned steakhouse it was a bit of a letdown. I don't believe to get a tender and flavorful steak one should have to resort to ordering off the very expensive wagyu menu SW had. Next time in Vegas I'm afraid I'll have to go with another steakhouse. When you drop as much money as we did in a steakhouse you only get one shot to prove yourself worthy.",

I was pushing my luck with a 5:30 reservation and needing to be out by 7:00 with a group of nine, but the waiter was able to make it happen for us! We requested a window view and it is truly gorgeous with the large waterfall and foliage outside.  Patio seating is available as well...but not preferred when it's 104 degrees outside.    The bone in rib-eye was cooked to perfection with great flavor and sear.  The side that impressed me the most was the black truffle creamed corn...the black truffle helped tone down the sweetness of the creamed corn.  The marble potatoes with green bean and bacon was just average in my opinion but still tasty nonetheless.  The service is top notch at this restaurant.  We didn't quite finish our 20oz steaks, so they offered to pack up our food and not only that they offered to cut up the steak so that it would be easier to eat later.  They also included their amazing bacon cheddar rolls and pretzel rolls in our to go boxes as well.  I can't say enough good things about the bacon cheddar rolls, definitely not healthy, but what can be better than a buttery roll with bacon pieces!  A definite must try if you are a steakhouse lover!  I'd pick this steakhouse over Del Frisco's which is now my 2nd favorite.",

All times I've visited, the caesar salad has been my go-to. It's chock-full of parmesan and tossed in a homemade dressing. I die. Their wedge is also a cut above the rest - it comes with a thick (I mean THICK) slab of bacon on top.   I've had both the filet and the scallops with risotto and both were equally delicious. You'd think a steakhouse would be better at steak, but the scallops were perfection and I could eat the risotto for days. Both times I had the steak, it was seared/cooked/seasoned perfectly.  Unfortunately, I've never had their dessert as I've always been too full to order it. Their service is nothing less than great - the waiters last time I went were so accommodating in making recommendations, letting us take our time and checking in often to make sure it was up to our standards. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Ok I was initially going to give this place a 4 but I just remembered what a good time I had with my friends and how our server, Chris was one of the best I have ever seen.  He was friendly, funny and had the best recommendations.  Needless to say, I had went with most of his recommendations.  So this review is based not on the steaks....well because I dont eat steak.  I knowww...why was I there then?  Well the others in my party had heard really good things about the steak and they were excited about...so why not? As long as they have some good seafood. THEY DID!  Scallops which happen to be my favorite on top of this wonderful black truffle and pea risotto.  OH yea...!  I was too preoccupied with my food to ask everyone else how their food was but I can safely say, they looked very happy!  Next was dessert....I am soooo glad I saved room for the most heavenly Creme Brulee topped with this fresh boysenberry jam accompanied by tiny little french madeleines (I dont think that's spelled right).  Yumm yumm!  We weren't seated in the outside patio, which is great because I tend to get cold a lot, but they were really nice to have a table for us with a great view of the parasol bar show from the inside.",

It is quite amazing that the las Vegas strip is beyond the waterfall and the foliage. The outdoor seating has a serene environment & puts you in an environment that has little to do with Vegas or the casino the restaurant is attached to. Although all this is erased every 30 minutes with the \"lake of dreams show.\" Which while entertaining can be quite bizarre.  We had the tuna ceviche, which was more like a fresh guacamole with really good tuna in it. The tortilla chip strips were a nice textural element. For our entree we shared the chile rubbed 42oz bone in ribeye for two. The steak was spicy and smoky with a nice charr. It was accompanied by char grilled onions and halapenos. We had the lobster Mac and cheese for a side which was tasty yet nothing special.  This is a traditional steak house with a non traditional atmosphere. It definitely makes for a nice night out in Vegas. I do recommend reservations as the restaurant was packed on a wednesday night.",

We got seated on this pillar, hard to describe. I think our server's name was Nina?   starters: maryland blue crabcake - great. fluffy, flavorful, yum! steve's chopped salad - surprisingly, this was really good. no regrets  meal: we shared the following: 42 oz. chile rubbed double rib eye  -wow..great meat, great oils, watch out for the pepper, it's really spicy (green one). I was waiting 3 months to have this, and it almost lived up to my expectations. The meat was good, but it wasn't \"melt in your mouth.\" I still enjoyed it to the last bit. ate both of the ribs on the plate, haah. 2 - roasted sonoma foie gras- this was good, i love foie gras, but my party didn't so we only needed 1, 2 was overkill. au gratin potatoes - if you love cheese....this is no question the best dish black truffle creamed corn - this was a great balancer to the meal. the peppers were so spicy, this helped a lot.  Overall, the service was top shelf. They were not intrusive, observed from a far and knew when we needed their assistance. the corkage fee was over the top, but they did decant the wine in a nice decanter, provide stemware, but still, $50 for corkage seemed steep.  i'll come here again, it was a great gift to my best friend and we left full.",

    "text": "Steakhouses are hard to review. Good steak is not actually that hard to come by. I cannot say that the steak here was somehow \"so much more steak-y\" than other fine establishments.  But I can say that the these guys can do more than just steak. They think they're a french restaurant. The rest of the menu is stronger than most traditional steakhouse. It's good, but I won't say that their other dishes are as good a proper french restaurant.  The steak was good, though. What I would recommend is that you order the steak \"for two\". It's served cut, and the kitchen does a much better job making the initial cuts than you would so little juice is wasted.  Ok, so there's this weird \"show\" that you watch during dinner. Don't get your hopes up here; it stuck most as surreal rather than entertaining or even appetizing. It's very Cirque de Soleil.  The show had to compete with the clientele. I've never seen so many attractive and well-heeled people in one restaurant in my life. Eye-candy abounds. Might want to iron your shirt before you come.  So why only three stars? Low taste/dollar. I guess if you really want great French food in Vegas, you're better off going to a real French restaurant. If you want really good steak, you might as well pay a bit less and go to BOA or one of the many, many others.",

It was way too hot outside, so we opted for an inside seat with a view of the waterfall.  The crab cakes for our appetizers were divine.  Our steaks, mine the filet, his the rib-eye, were both cooked to perfection.  The creamed spinach just melted in my mouth, and the potatoes au gratin was so rich and creamy - to our horror - we just couldn't finish it all!   How sad it was to watch them take it away.   We were too full to have any dessert.  Our waiter was very nice and made the overall experience of the restaurant a memorable last night of our vacation.  As it should be, this is a 'nice' restaurant that prefers their guests to dress accordingly, and I've seen them turn people away.  Nothing irks me more than someone walking into a 5 star restaurant in ripped jeans and a dirty t-shirt, when everyone else is in semi-formal dress.  Make an effort.",

We were staying at the Wynn anyway so I made the reservation.  I can say with certainty that we have both had better.  The setting is nice, service was as-close-to-correct (being Vegas), wine selection was excellent, the food: good but I really expected great. I had a ribeye which was cooked perfectly but just lacked deep \"high end-steak\" flavor, even though it had slightly too much fat which should have helped. I tried to \"fix it\" with SW's own version of A1 sauce but it did not work. My love had the Sea Bass which she also described as \"just not memorable\".  The highlight of the meal (besides the company) was a perfectly made Mojito and the selection of table breads (but I had to ask for it). I enjoyed the Au Gratin potatoes as well but the other 2 sides we ordered ...not so much. Maybe its me, but i feel that for $250 for 2 people the steak should be the star, and that evening at SW it wasn't shining brightly. Would I go back, simply no, there are way better steaks in town (Craftsteak being one). I read in a guest room propaganda magazine that Steve Wynn is a vegan...hmmm??.",

SW broils their steaks (as does Peter Luger and Ruth's Chris) which I think results in better flavor than grilling.  The meat was tender and full of flavor.  The steak came with a few sauces, which I completely ignored since i couldn't imagine putting anything on such a well-cooked steak.  As I was eating my steak, I thought, \"The only steak that edges this one out is Peter Luger.\"  Then I went to Peter Luger's twice in the following two months and no, Peter Luger's did not edge out SW.  SW was, in my book, a much better steak.  The decor was setting was also very nice.  We had a table by the man-made pool thing where we saw some shows that looked like they came from a grown-up Disneyland on acid.",

Choosing to remain at the bar as opposed to taking a table, myself and a friend must have spent 3+ hours sipping, tasting, and socializing in the bar. Nothing against the restaurant dining room, which is like most any other fine dining room in Las Vegas, but sometimes it really kills the buzz to sit-down for a quiet dinner when you're in the mood just to have a good time.  So, instead we sat at the bar and socialized our way through various appetizers, entrees, and bottles of wine.  The chilled Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail was out of this world. Of course so was the price at $20, but it is Vegas after all. Nothing comes cheep, so be prepared to spend. We also had a caprese type dish, which was disappointing because of the mushy tomatoes, but I don't even know if it was on the menu so that's probably just what we get. Making up for that mistake we ordered the Filet with blue cheese that was amazing as well.  The wine list was extensive, specifically focusing on big reds from California, Italy, and France. We had a bottle of Shafer Merlot and a Brunello (this was the second bottle so the name escapes me). Overall, our experience was quite enjoyable as I'm sure the bartender, hostesses, and any guest passing through the bar could attest to. Enjoy!",

It is more private, quieter, and it's elegance doesn't shout at you.  Feel it and breathe it in.  The big plus for those who are used to fine dining from a NY or SF, the prices at Wynn are not that bad.  I took 3 others with me and the bill was less than $500 with cocktail and wine.  The cap of the night was to have Steve Wynn, the modern day Da Vinci, and one of the top business men sit two tables away...10-minutes later Mick Jagger joins Wynn for dinner.  My party were amazed.

MY boyfriend had the Australian waygu and he wasn't as satisfied with it and says it was not worth $150, he tried mine and was satisfied with mine so will definitely go back and have ribeye! all the sides were delish with great flavor!!",

    "text": "This won't be a fair review because we had a show to watch at 7pm but got our food at 6:20pm so we had to scarf down EVERYTHING.  However, I will review the outstanding aspects of our speed eating.  Bacon and cheddar au gratin - OMG, those were SO AMAZING.  It was melty, gooey, cheesy, salty, and delicious. Truffle creamed corn - the texture is a bit odd since it's like chopped up bits of corn, not the entire kernel, but the flavor is still all there.  the truffles add this intense kick at the end, loved it Filet mignon - i ordered mine medium rare and it came out almost well done.  i had no time to complain so i just scarfed that meat down.  it was still very tender and juicy but i'm sure it would've tasted even better if it wasn't so overcooked.  next time we'll schedule out at least 2-3 hours to actually enjoy our meal instead of being super ghetto and asking for the check and to-go boxes right when our food came out.",

My aunt next me ordered the filet well done.....but she got it and it was burnt to a crisp! Lol I couldn't believe it. Sometimes u really don't get what you pay for. I just wasn't impressed.

Our waiter knew the menu inside and out and was extremely helpful in making recommendations.  We started off with the carpaccio, which was good but surprisingly slightly inferior to the one at ToW (the truffle oil used on the ToW carpaccio was great).  I started off with a glass of the Monchhof Urziger Wurzgarten Riesling, which was exceptionally well balanced and one of the better Rieslings that I have had.  For dinner, I had the Wagyu Sirloin, which was a special for the night.  One word: AMAZING.  The cut was perfectly marbleized and melted in the mouth. Everything about the steak was perfect, easily the best cut of meat I've ever eaten. I had a glass of Merlot from Bordeaux with the steak which was good but nothing special.   For dessert, we ordered the chocolate soufle, which was also delicious and a great end to an excellent meal.  Despite the high price tag, the food and service was to die for and I'll definitely be back.",

The sides of cream corn and spinach were to creamy for me but I don't have taste buds or a digestive system that can do creamy anything. The wine was excellent the service was even better.

It was probably normally a delicious meal, just people sitting around my table were on cellphones (or they were ringing), being obnoxious (I thought a $175 steak would weed those types out of the dining room), and just generally not creating a quiet and luxurious environment.  Everything had this feeling (and taste) of being good parts, but together made each dish WAY too rich.",

    "text": "I dined here when I saw Garth for the first time. Loved the show! It was apparent that Mr. Wynn spared no expense with regard to the acoustics. We loved the show so much, we went a second time, and my employer will be taking her husband to see Garth again on November 21, 2010.   My employer, a dressed down Las Vegas attorney, went to pick up the tickets to the show earlier that day. She asked an employee at an Asian restaurant, where the fine steakhouses were located so she could make reservations for us. Looking down their noses at her, they recommended that perhaps she should go to the coffee shop. This reflects very badly on the Hotel in general, assuming she couldn't possibly afford to or have the inclination to dine in a fine steakhouse.   The restaurant was clean, well staffed and rather quiet...Hmmm, still trying to figure out why I had to literally \"FLAG\" down someone to fill my water glass, and wine glass. It shouldn't have been that difficult, since they crammed us into the back corner where we could easily be seen. The staff stood around and jabbered with one another as we attempted to get their attention for service.  A strong indication that our order sat on the line for quite a while before it arrived at our table.   The lobster was delivered cold and chewy as shoe leather...quite possibly, the worst I've ever experienced in my life. I never imagined that a succulent lobster could be transformed into such a rubbery mass. The steak was tough and dry.  Definately not cooked to order, and I wasn't impressed in the least with the cold creamed corn with...what was that, truffle or truffle oil? Didn't taste like any truffle I've ever had that was worth remembering. Honestly, I've eaten better steaks at Ruth's Chris and have experienced a far better quality of service at The Sizzler.   I've dined from Delmonico's on the strip to Dal Rae in Pico Rivera, and I truly expected better quality of food and service from such an esteemed establishment. I am embarrassed for my employer for receiving such poor customer service and being treated by Hotel staff like a low class vagrant. If you're going to pay top dollar to dine, one should expect to receive impeccable service and exceptional food. I love Steve Wynn, but this place needs some sturdy polishing if it expects to compete with the finest.",

The red wine sauce was a good effort. The Chocolate souffle can be skipped.   The service could have been better. We filled our own wine, had to request water to be refilled, and got charged for items we didn't order. How can that happen when we rarely got checked on upon??  There was also no apology for the overcharge. I guess it is a regular occurance. We ordered our dessert with our meal or could have spent an hour longer there easily. Also, even though we ordered the souffle early as it has a prep time, we didnt get it for a half hour after our steak was finished.   The view of the Wynn waterfall is beautiful and adds to the aesthetic appeal.",

It is my favorite restaurant in the world. Everything on the menu is fantastic and the service is simply as good as it gets. I usually get the petite filet and it melts in your mouth. Friends usually get the bone-in ribeye, which makes it difficult for them to visit any other steakhouse. Every single appetizer and side dish is the best I've ever had anywhere. Yeah, it's super-expensive, but worth every cent. The little extras like the types of breads and butter they serve plus the waterfall and frog show (be sure to request an outdoor table) make it the most memorable place you will ever dine. Bet on it!",

Our entree came after at least 30 minutes after we finish all the appetizers and no one came to check on us if we need anything. even the table next us had meal earlier than us and they sat down after we already ordered our food. Then we told our sever we don't feel like the Kobe steak we ordered, and he looked us with a dismissive sight like we never had Kobe before and tell us that is the flavor the Kobe should be. OMG I am not super rich but I still get lucky to try few times of good Kobe ! I do feel they have racism because we are all Asian!

At the end of the meal it took quite a while for the server to deliver the check, this happened at 3 separate restaurants during my stay in Vegas so I've accepted it as a Vegas thing.

The Hotel and casino was amazing however I am not rating the hotel or casino I am rating SW steakhouse. A complete disaster.   We were a party of Six we ordered drinks and appetizer and food and sides and dessert. so we experienced the whole think with this establishment.   The steaks were terrible and dry from the Fillet Mignon, Rib Eye Steak, New York Strip, and even the Chicken.... Wow I can't believe it. they missed the mark on every once order. The only thing that was good was the french fries.... Even the mac and cheese was terrible.   The service was horrible. It was a cooler evening so we asked for the heater to be turned on which is right above our table.... They turned it on and then they turned it off, when asked why they did that they said the table next to us didn't want it on. What!! that table next to us has its own heater what the heck does our heater have to do with their table. They were six people just like us and we ordered more stuff then they did.   I really wanted to complain while we were there, however my group said it wouldn't make a difference. I just told the waiter to compliment the chef on the French Fries... I hope that made sense to him.   I wish we had gone to Ruth Chris and spent the money there. At least we would have got excellent service and most importantly great food. and then went to the Wynn to enjoy the hotel and casino.  Mr. Wynn I don't know what you were thinking about that steakhouse, however I would really would appreciate if you were to go and try it yourself.",

The reason behind the one star is because I couldn't post my review without at least one but I give SW zero stars for the awful service. We are all visitors to LV and I would expect a higher standard of conduct to hotel guests. There was nothing hospitable, kind of personable about the staff at the front. Not one smile or attempt to make the experience pleasurable. You have many other options in this hotel and city, pass on SW.",

The chopped salad and ceviche appetizer were delicious- very fresh and my filet was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got the ribeye and was not disappointed- so tender. We got the creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and hash browns as our sides and they were amazing too! They even offered an option to do half orders for the sides! Loved the ambiance, service and light show as well. Great experience, we will be back!",

Lets start with the matre d, several table open at the windows and refuse to let us dine there. The head waiter was very indifferent to us, he spent much time at his other tables but only came to ours 3 times (ordering,salads, check) Food; the florida crab claws were great, the caesar salad dressing was very good but flat lettuce swimming in dressing does not make a salad  worth eating, the chef special bone-in filet was a beautiful piece of meat that was wasted by bad cooking, i order medrare, was med+ on the edges to nearly raw at the bone, waiter never came by to check on us or our meal.waiter finally showed up, with a $400 bill, no dessert, no happy birthday, not evan a kiss",

The quality of the meat was exceptional, but be warned, you may not be able to finish because the portions are huge.  The wine list is impressive.

I ate so much that I had to throw up to make more space.  I meant that literally not figuratively.  I actually chucked because I wanted more and I had no more space.  I had the Bone in Rib-Eye and it was just wonderful.  Perfect medium-rare and perfect cut.  Now I expected the meat to be good so it was no surprise that it was.  What really got me was the cream corn.  Seriously!  Serio pedo, it was the greatest side to any meal that I have ever had.  Enough said!    I also wanted to discuss the wonderful bacon muffins.  Well I guess I just did.  Overall this place is fantastic; those who complain about the cost are probably the same people who complain that the 007 movies are not realistic.  Come on guys, enjoy the ride.",

I also tried the foie gras for the first time and it wasn't my thing but it tasted like fat.   The side of mashed potatoes we order was not good. For dessert we had a neutella ice-cream/cake which was really good but I barely made a dent cause I cleaned the steak.  This place is hands down the best steakhouse I've been to so far in Las Vegas. I've previously lived in NY and Boston and been to these ranked from highest to lowest in my opinion. I always get porterhouse or ribeye and have it cooked med-rare.  SW Grill 23 Del Frisco Peter Luger Morton's Sparks Smith & Wollensky Capital Grill Old Homestead CARNEVINO  I know these aren't considered steaks but Megu is great for Waygu beef and Lawry's is great for prime rib.",

    "text": "I finally made it to SW...and don't think that I'll make it back.  I requested patio dining, knowing that I may have to wait for something to open up.  It was worth the wait to sit outside.  As others have said, the \"shows\" are a bit different and don't think that they really go with the surrounding restaurants.  Nonetheless, you still can't help but watch it, even if they are a bit cheesy.   After ordering a few drinks and apps, the server was not to be seen.  At a restaurant of this magnitude, empty drinks or empty salad plates should not linger long.  After sitting there for at least 10 minutes we had to wave down another waiter to order another drink and ask him to take our dirty plates.  Finally the main course and sides arrived.  The food was good - highly recommend the creamed corn! It is out of this world.  The mushrooms and steak were really good, but not great.  Again our server was not to be seen.  This time we waved down a manager of some sort and told him our server was MIA.   After that, our server tried to make it up by checking on us multiple times, but the damage was done.  When dropping $150+/person for dinner, I should not have to try to hunt down a server, it ruins the experience.   Hopefully management fixes this...as frequent visitors to the hotel, it would be nice to return, but with such terrible service, it probably won't happen.",

Unfortunately, last night was such an opposite experience from previous ones. It was extremely underwhelming. Our drinks took very long to arrive, so long that my boyfriend and I asked the waiter if he could go check. Our bread basket only had one kind, when in any other time it has had at least three kinds. For our main course we shared a bone-in Rib eye; it was cold, felt a bit dry and not tender. I had spoken so highly of SW to my bf who had never  been, that when we tried the steak I felt almost embarrassed.  Im baffled about how different it was from previous times... the consistent quality of the food and service just wasn't there this time",

We were party of 6 and I was the only one who insist to go there as I had good experience before but this time was really disappointed. We ordered Caesar  salad and Seared Steak Tartare for appetizer which both are good actually but for main course we ordered 3 medium rare plus porterhouse which supposed to be the best cut, but this time was not, no flavor not Tender at all. IT WAS USED TO BE THE BEST CUT BEFORE  BUT PROBABLY I NEVER GONNA TRY IT AGAIN. I also ordered the NY Strip 2 months ago (before my last visit to SW) which was not good too but I wanted to give them another chance and this time, I was embarrassed and feel sorry  because it was my strong recommendation to my friends to go to this steakhouse and none of my friends were happy. Atmosphere was great and our waiter was nice and respectful but food did not meet those expectation at all. Again, I have been at this steakhouse for at least 14 times before but NOT ANYMORE.",

My steak was cooked wrong & when I told the busser he took it away & dumped it. No I'm sorry or getting our server or management. The server did not check on us once after the food was delivered. I wasn't asked if I wanted another glass of wine. It seemed as if we weren't a priority because we were young & weren't going to spend money or tip well. So upset about our experience. $300+ down the drain. I'm giving 1 Star because the property is beautiful. I will be writing corporate regarding my experience.",

    "text": "Well, I felt let down. Decided to spend my 50th birthday at the Encore and dine at SW and see le reve after.  Started great with everyone greeting me with a happy birthday wish! Fantastic off to a great start.  Hostesses and waiter also were aware the show was an hour and a half away. Assured us Plenty of time to enjoy and make the show which is only a couple minute walk. Drinks, apps, bread start coming, \"Excellent Shrimp cocktail\" great bread \"pretzel bread was Great! Plenty of time! Hour +  Table cleared, more drinks. Here is where it fell apart. A lull of about 30+ minutes before we were advised salad is coming,  Ordered the Wynn chopped, honestly think they forget the dressing?  Was very bland, Looking at time before starting salad noticed we have about 20 minutes before we need to go. Advised the waiter about our time, he said main course will be right up. We were less than half way through our salad when the steaks arrive with the sides.  Less than half way through the steak they bring me a happy birthday plate and a bill.  We were told when making Reservation we would have Plenty of time to enjoy dinner. Again assured by hostess and waiter the same. \"They were not busy when we arrived, or during our service\"  Unsure of the 30+ minute lull in service they seem to have forgotten us. Then to ram steaks, sides and dessert and a bill almost at once was very disappointing. Was only able to eat half my steak and a few bites of the sides. 1.5 hours is plenty of time for a dinner service with far less than half a house of people and a complete full staff. Well we made the show on time! And had to leave half of what we ordered behind along with a few hundread dollars. I would think this should have been easy, with extra time to spare all while enjoying everything. Nope ruined a very special dinner. Wish I would have done The Sinatra for my special 50th, the service was 100 times better, and all done in 1.5 hours with no rush 2 days later. And a full house. Food overall 3.5, service 3, lack of following through with complete service on a very special occasion,  after being assured multiple times we would have plenty of time 0 stars.  We did not order excessive, or order hard/long cook items, and it was not busy! THEY just blew it. Think they were more concentrated on the 2 couple party that arrived when we did who did not have a Reservation, but did have a hundread dollor bill in hand slipped to the hostess. They had complete attention by double + staff the entire time.",

I was shocked. It easily could have been split by two. It was very good though and I wish I could have eaten more. My husband and I split the bone in ribeye, medium rare. Quality of meat was excellent and portion size was again, huge! We had au gratin potatoes and sauteed wild mushrooms for sides. The mushroom were the clear winner. I also tried the truffle cream corn but didn't care for it (way too much truffle for my personal preference.) If you like truffle and corn though, you will LOVE this side. We booked months in advance so we had a great view inside but right by the sliding glass doors which they opened up as the night went on. Booking reservations here was the hardest time I've had booking reservations in Vegas, so I'd suggest booking way in advance so you don't miss out!",

    "text": "Their dogs go \"wan wan\".  Cats, \"nyan nyan\".  So what do cows sound like in Japan?  Moo.  Same sound, yes, but wow, do they taste different.  Enter SW Steakhouse, offering the largest selection of True Japanese wagyu brands in Vegas.  All A5, BMS 8-10.  (BMS 12 tops the scale). Translated, nearly the best quality.  Each brand has its own unique flavor.  All show a unique sweetness not found in American beef.  All very rich but the fat in unique; it leaves no cloying oily finish on the palate.  Tip:  Order the steak blue (seared and raw in the middle) to rare.  Best way to savor the fat within.  Tip:  Unless sharing, stick with the 4oz portion of Japanese wagyu.  Very rich.  Props to you if you can finish more.  Tip:  Go with a group and order all the Japanese Wagyu brands and compare them side by side.  Fun and eye opening.  Kobe - Offered in various cuts.  The rib cap is the most tender and flavorful.  Velvety mouth feel as the fat melts on the tongue at body temperature.  Pronounced sweetness lacking all mineral flavor usually associated with beef.  Ohmi - NY strip.  Viscous fat melting below body temperature.  Velvety mouth feel.  Sweet with a distinct but pleasant animal fat aroma (think uncured bacon).  Again, no mineral flavors.  A personal favorite.  Kagoshima - NY strip.  Closest to American Kobe.  Incredibly tender and less sweetness than the other brands.  Has a beef flavor with some minerality.  Prefer an all American steakhouse experience?  SW offers a good selection of more traditional USDA prime, wet and dry aged beef and American Wagyu.  Only tried the dry aged New York.  Cooked to temp with even sear.  Well trimmed with a gentle umame finish from the aging.  Sides?  For Japanese beef, none.  For American beef, the black truffle cream corn is outstanding.  Umame punch of the truffles plays well on that of the dry aged steak.  Sauteed  wild mushrooms; aggressively seasoned with a generous amount of chanterelles simple good eats.   Seafood?  Uhh, this is a Steakhouse although the restaurant does offer seafood, poultry, lamb and vegetarian (yes, I know how silly that sounds) options.  Desserts?  Way to full to sample.  Service is very polished and professional yet steakhouse friendly.  Excellent wine list with some vintage depth.  Typical resort pricing.  An overindulgence for sure but hey, it's Vegas baby!",

    "text": "There are many great places for steak in Las Vegas. However in addition to the excellent steak, outstanding service sets SW above the others. Entering SW is walking into an elegant space. The decor is warm and beautiful. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were immediately seated at a table that I requested which was along the windows facing the Lake of Dreams.  Our servers, Katherine along with her associates were very extremely attentive. Our dining experience began with perfect cocktails. The bread and water service followed and were monitored continuously. I received a recommendation for an excellent Pinot Noir. The food service began with the Yellow Fin Tuna Ceviche that just melted in your mouth. We both ordered the 9 oz Filet Mignon, hers well done and mine medium rare. Both were juicy and tender. Side orders of summer vegetables and Onion Rings were enough for 4 people.  SW Steakhouse continues that over the top dining which we have experienced at other Wynn and Encore restaurants.",

    "text": "During my Vegas trip with my girlfriend for our one year anniversary, we wanted to get something special and we wanted steak so I decided to make a reservation for this restaurant. Making a reservation was easy since you can do it online or over the phone. They had a time that we wanted more when I called so a good tip is if you don't see a time in the website, try giving them a call too! This restaurant has a dress code so do dress up! Once we got there, we were seated shortly after checking in. The decor is definitely on the fancy side and there is also a waterfall that has some light shows. The waiters were patient and very knowledgeable about each of the dishes we asked about. We decided to get the dry aged snake river farms domestic A5 wagyu with a side of truffle gnocchi and au gratin potatoes. They even had complementary bread, which was probably some of the best bread I've ever had. The A5 wagyu we had was cooked medium rare and was very tender. Slicing it was a breeze and one bite into it was an explosion of flavor and oil. It was worth every dollar I paid for it. The au gratin potatoes were thinly sliced and were quite heavy. This was the same with the truffle gnocchi. Nevertheless, the experience here was very memorable and is definitely a restaurant that suits a dinner for a special occasion!",

    "text": "This is hands down my favorite steakhouse and restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Over and over and over again it always proves that it has the elegance, the flavors, and the staff/entertainment that will always top any steakhouse in all of Las Vegas. You must get reservations in advance. You also must dress elegant and expect an elegant ambience. I recommend asking in advance if you can have a patio seat. Because in the evening hours they do a laugh for water shows that are quite entertaining but not as lively as let's say the Bellagio fountain shows. It's great for a date and it's also great for a great big group. The best part about this is that it allows for kosher options for steak and vegan options for anywhere from macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and other pastas and vegetables options. The staff is very attentive. I recommend getting the wedge salad, tuna tartare, the ribeye, and the donuts at the end for dessert. They put the desert on a tree looking  design holding the funnel cake with lots of different sauces such as strawberry and chocolate to dip. Incredible.",

    "text": "While my friends and I were planning a Vegas trip, we wanted to spare a night for fine dining. After some research we elected SW Steakhouse to be our destination.  Made a reservation 2 weeks beforehand, Saturday evening at 5:30pm. It's located at Wynn hotel ground floor. Not difficult to find this place at all so we got there a bit early. Checked in to make sure the staff knew we were there already, and decided to chill at the bar a bit. I myself got a Mojito and it was pretty good - it was quite strong and I knew this is gonna be a nice dinner.  Got sit in right on time. Once stepped in and looked to the right, there was a large door/window openings and a man made, tall waterfall was there - not sure they did any sound effect but it really sounded like a huge waterfall inside a forrest. Nice environment with the natural light! Now the prime time for food:  -) The Bread: A. What a nice start. There were two different kinds of breads, all garlic based and they were just so good and fresh and couldn't stop eating until my friends asked me to stop and save for the steak. Alight... but man that was good.  -) Mushroom soup: A-. The whole soup was concentrated with chopped mushroom, not the usual milky-cream type and that was what made it unique. If it could be slightly less salty it would have been even better.  -) 20oz rib eye with addition of Alaskan King Crab (oscar style): A. Wow what a nice steak! I asked for medium rare and it was exactly my definition of medium rare. The outside layer was slightly crispy and the inside was soooo tender and juicy. Haven't had that good of a steak for a long time! 20oz is indeed a huge portion and I managed to finish the whole thing, it was just too good. The asparagus sitting below the steak received some juice from the steak, and the two tastes mixed and coordinated with each other very nicely. The Alaskan King Crab on the other hand was a bit disappointed. It's actually an option to be added so I did, and it was just slightly too cheesy and it didn't match with the steak well.  -) Mushroom (as sides): A+. Oh man that mushroom was so memorable. With its garlic based sauce and the green onion on top, and the cooking time was right at the point where the sauce went into the mushroom while keeping the freshness of it, that was indeed the best mushroom side I have ever had.  -) Cream Corn (as sides): A-. It was not liquid type of creamy, the texture was more like mashed potato but with corn. The sweetness of the corn was quite outstanding.  -) Mac and Cheese (as sides): B+. Comparatively this was not as good as the other two sides above; but don't get me wrong it was good too; just that it was not anything spectacular and I would have gone with other choices instead.  It was my friend's birthday and the restaurant got us free chocolate dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate with chocolate, how generous!  Needless to say this place is pricey and we ended up paying around $120 per person. But the food and environment was super nice. This place is good for group gathering as well as romantic date (just don't sit too close to the waterfall side if you want to enjoy some quiet time) so definitely I am going to go back someday when I'm in Vegas again!",

First off their restaurant is very beautiful. They have a very clean and elegant look with a waterfall garnishing their outdoor eating area. The service was top notch and very interactive. Appetizers and bread selection were elite as well.  I am a very big fan of steak and have been to other steakhouse here in Vegas and the rest of the work, but I have to say SW is definitely one of the best places I have ever ate at. Their bone-in 24oz ribeye was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and had such great flavor. I could've ate three orders of that ribeye. Definitely looking forward to our next dinner here.",

The cocktails were perfect as was the service. I was looking over the fabulous menu with the bartender told me the chef was doing a slow braised Wagyu Short Rib. I ordered that with the Yukon Gold Potato Puree. While enjoying my pre-dinner cocktail I got an important phone call. My food came while I was talking...bartender politely came over and said, \"Mr. Crawford...please eat that while it's hot\". I kind of looked at him oddly then at my plate...abruptly told the caller I had to go. He was so right. Damn, I make an amazing Short Rib but I was outdone! Best Short Rib I've ever enjoyed. I thanked the bartender for the recommendation and telling me to basically get off the phone and EAT!  Can't wait for my next trip...only stay at the Wynn/Encore.

We were celebrating our engagement and wanted a romantic/upscale experience. The food was delicious. We both had steak and some tasty sides. The starter bread is also very good and supremely above average. The unique show adds to the experience. I would suggest making reservations and requesting outside seating for the best seat of the house. While we enjoyed the food and show, the service lacked a bit. On the night of our visit, we had several waiters come to our table as we didn't have an assigned waiter. Also, the service was a bit slow. I don't know if the restaurant was short staffed on that day, but it was definitely a bit upsetting given how expensive this restaurant can be. In general, we had a good experience.

In other words, the table was a bit large for five. But five is an odd number, so we accepted that, and decided to talk louder.  This review is top rate, but let me give some detail. We started with ordering two orders of the crab pasta, but asked them to split it into five servings.   They agreed, though I could not believe it. This super fancy restaurant wants to accommodate my request to put two portions into five servings? That is so crazy, but they easily accommodated me.  Then, for the next course, was asked to split two mixed salads into five plates. Again, they did this. That is way too nice. I gave my server a $20 cash tip in his hand, because they are being too nice.  For the third course, we each ordered the 9 oz filet. It was so cool, when the steaks are ready, the staff puts them all on the table at exactly the same time. This is very professional!  So...this is the perfect dinner experience. Every detail is perfect. Our dinner server,  Edward, was so helpful. He is the epitome of a professional.  A ten star experience. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "This was a really disappointing experience... We came in this past weekend to celebrate our anniversary + my boyfriend's birthday. We purposely chose this place as a special occasion dinner since my boyfriend had an amazing previous experience a few years ago. However, this visit left a lot to be desired.  We were seated outside next to a space heater, we weren't cold at all - the ambiance outside is SO much fun! We absolutely loved it!  What started our experience off on a bad start though was the wait staff... We couldn't figure out who was actually our server for the first 20min of being seated. The woman who we thought was our server came by again to drop off our drinks - but she didn't even look at us or say anything. She dropped off the drinks and just walked away. We tried talking to her, but she just left. Then our actual server came by. He was not very helpful when we asked for advice on navigating the menu. He was not able to offer detailed descriptions of different entrees, all of the answers were pretty short, and we were a little frustrated trying to figure out what we wanted to order from the selection of steaks. My boyfriend & I agreed that our server was much more friendly later on in the meal...  The food was pretty good. We split all of our dishes & left very full. We had the kale salad + the Snake River Wagyu + a side of the creamed corn. Honestly, we would've ordered more, but the appetizers selection left a lot to be desired. The bread selection was sooo good - obviously loved the Cheddar biscuits. The Kale Salad was AWESOME, we hope we can try to recreate this at home. The Snake River Wagyu (especially with the peppercorn crust) was delicious, and even more so when eaten with the butter supplied. My boyfriend really enjoyed the creamed corn, but I felt it was way too sweet & rich. I could only have a little bit.  The server did bring out a little dessert at the end for our anniversary/birthday celebration, which was a nice little touch!  Overall, for a special occasion dinner, we were pretty disappointed. It didn't knock our socks off like many of the other restaurants in Vegas. We come to Vegas for the unique food experiences and this just didn't do it for us.",

Ordered MR+ and came out Rare.  It's amazing how for the price paid that these types of places so oftentimes miss the mark on meat temp. Its inexcusable IMO.  In addition, the service was mediocre at best - a significant underperformance given the lofty prices.  Overall could not recommend and would not return.",

    "text": "I am uniquely qualified to review SW as I have dined here over 200 times. When the restaurant/property opened in 2005 I became a regular. A few years later another regular started dining at SW every single night and he certainly became the most regular diner here. Well he died, RIP MD, so I think I have regained the title.  The restaurant is beautifully situated on the Lake of Dreams tucked far enough away from the casino to achieve a sense of serenity. BUT, the restaurant is far from serene as it is almost always packed and filled with energy. SW has successfully achieved an indoor/outdoor ambiance which adapts to weather and features mini shows on the lake every 45 minutes. My only harsh criticism is the pace at which new segments are added to the Lake of Dreams. Newbies enjoy them but they do get stale for regulars and it doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to program new content.  The bar awaits you when you enter the restaurant and is great featuring two TVs, top notch bartenders and a full menu. I love watching games here or grabbing dinner if in a rush. Excellent selection of wines by the glass.  The dining room is expansive with outdoor patio that opens seamlessly, weather permitting. There are private rooms in the back that can connect if necessary and a \"private\" patio. Great place for an epic private dining experience. The dining room has great energy due to the crowd and see and be seen design (eye level mirrors throughout).  Despite the great location, design and energy... the food and service steal the show. When the restaurant opened it had an all-star crew including the poet/sommelier Noe (best in town). The entire team was \"poached/recruited\" (you can find them at Scarpetta delivering the same world class service). Fortunately, SW was able to maintain its standards and you can expect attentive, gracious service.  It's really about the food. It starts with the bread basket which has pretzel bread, cheese rolls and corn bread... now French I think. I try not to eat them but always do because they are so good. The steaks are all prime or better and usually cooked to perfection. They are all excellent. Great seafood selection including stone crab when in season and crab legs. There are usually specials most recently Sardinian Gnocchi. Delicious.   You will spend some money here so be prepared. If you want the full steak/wine experience but don't want to break the bank or don't have a comp, try the Meyer Cabernet. In 2006 it used to be about a $100 but has crept up every year as the wine keeps getting better. It's the best value and a no brainer. Probably around $135 now which is the low end of their list. Cheers!  If you want a no risk high quality dining EXPERIENCE, SW will deliver... even if you are a vegan.... there is a menu for that too!",

    "text": "My wife and I selected this restaurant to celebrate her birthday during our stay in Las Vegas. We were seated, given menus and offered water by a server. We then waited 15 minutes before our assigned waitress came and greeted us. We were never told anything about the restaurant or any chef specials for the evening-as we overheard our neighboring tables were. I mentioned to the waitress that we were celebrating my wife's birthday and she casually acknowledged. We ordered drinks-my wife selected a speciality cocktail and I ordered an old fashioned with preference for a particular 'high end' whiskey.  The waitress questioned my choice-\"Are you sure you want that?\" She swiftly brought me a drink menu and showed me the price list-I'm well aware of prices in Las Vegas and this is not our first time traveling.  We then ordered our food-my wife and I shared a 24oz beef cut (plenty of food for two) along with two sides. As we sat and waited , enjoying the beauty of the outdoors, we couldn't help but notice that the guests around us were receiving top service and attention. We were never approached or asked if we were in need of anything or perhaps wanted to order more cocktails. After nearly an hour, our meal was served- the food was delicious. We were never approached during to see how things were...never asked if we needed anything. We finished eating and sat with our empty, dirty plates on the table for over 30 minutes. The staff and our waitress walked by MANY times assisting neighboring tables. We flagged a server down and asked him to kindly remove our soiled plates. He then offered us dessert menus. The restaurant and our waitress were well aware that it was my wife's birthday. As we sat, there were numerous parties celebrating birthdays. They were brought a small desert and a candle in acknowledgement. That was something NEVER offered to us. At this point we were both very upset and honestly felt a bit discriminated against. We waited about 10 minutes (watching others being waited on and treated well) and never were acknowledged by our waitress asking how everything was. We again had to ask the server for the bill- we paid and left. I'm writing this review because I came to this restaurant because I'm a guest in the hotel -I was expecting top service and treatment and was given nothing of the sort. I'm truly disappointed.",

All the sides I had on both nights varied from average to \"are you serious with this crap?\"  The decor, atmosphere and waterfall-lightshow-psychedelic-frog thing were solid, but it didn't make up for the food. The service was standard high-end steakhouse excellence and worthy of 4.5 stars alone. I'm sure there have to be better steak options in Vegas. My sense is that SW gets the benefit of the doubt from a lot of people because it's in the Wynn which is one of the best properties on the strip - shame.  Take a pass on this one.",

As it was raining and the outside shut down there was a bit of a wait but being the fine place that it is they made all our drinks while waiting on the house.  The food is to die for and with our group of 7 there where many appetizers to sample and the crab legs where to melt in your mouth.  The dinner was well worth it even if it's high $$$$ . But do not regret  dinning here at all and we left  a $275 tip as the service and food is that good.",

    "text": "Steve Wynn is a radical vegan these days, so all his restaurants feature vegan options. I am most definitely NOT a vegan...but I like to try new stuff, so a friend took me out for a little sampling one night. We started with appetizers here, and then walked across the hall to Lakeside for our entrees (see my other review).  I had also been here once for dinner, at which time I had steak. I don't remember much about that previous meal other than the fact that the place seemed overbearingly full of itself, and was mainly patronized by the Beverly Hills Botox Gang. Also, my boyfriend at the time had to lie and pretend he was a client of his (a high roller who was staying at the Wynn)...otherwise they were \"booked up\" and weren't able to accommodate us, so sorry (yeah...it's THAT kind of place).  But anyhoo, THIS time, my friend and I had a reservation, and just ordered cocktails and appetizers...all from the vegan menu. We had a sort of molded quinoa salad that was FANTASTIC, plus a butternut squash soup with cilantro that was FAAAABULOUS. We also had some croquettes that were made from some weird meat-substitute that tasted like whatever it is they put in croquettes (peasant fetuses or something, knowing the kind of people who dine here). Everything was delicious, and the waiter and host staff were courteous and friendly, even though we were only having apps and not racking up a huge check. Bonus points to them for that!  Alas, I f*cked up the vegan theme by eating the bacon cornbread muffin from the bread basket. The waiter didn't offer to bring us a vegan bread basket, which they did later at Lakeside...just the regular shtick, which was the usual Holy Trinity of BreadBaskets: pretzel bread, cranberry bread and bacon muffin.  Atmosphere-wise, this is sort of a mix between those clubby old-school steakhouses, and the hip new douchey kind of steakhouses. Muted color palette, sort of country-club bland. I think some kind of equally bland Diana Krall-type jazz playing in the background. Boisterous laughter from the red-faced captains of industry at the tables around us, chortling over their latest acquisitions and tax evasions.  A few cranky old couples in Ralph Lauren and St. John, mincing their steaks in the grim-faced silence that only comes with decades of miserable coexistence with someone you hate, but married because of their pedigree and the lifestyle they were able to provide you. You know....THOSE kind of people eat here!!!  Honestly, unless you want swanky vegan food (and even then), I don't really see much to recommend here, as it is very expensive and not all that exciting of a scene. But...if the last time you slept with your steel-titan husband was during the Reagan administration, and your grandson just crashed the Jaguar you bought him as a graduation gift, and you regularly clean out the La Mer counter at Bendel's in a hopeless quest to regain your tennis-playing youth and firm up your withered jowls......you just might dig this joint!",

So we decided to try SW despite the restaurant being named after Steve Wynn, a vegan.   The restaurant was nice, but it was noisy. Our waiter was sharp, attentive, and helpful. We shared the porterhouse and it was cooked perfectly to our order. The sides were tasty. We were very happy.  Only 4 stars due to noise, stuck in a corner with no view, and food was a bit overpriced.",

    "text": "Two words: lobster macaroni! *nom, nom, nom, nom*  I have some really awesome friends and last week for my birthday I was treated to an amazing dinner here. Dinner started with the foie gras that everyone mentioned. We ordered the sauteed version (there are two variations) and it was different than anything I've ever had. The blackberry jam perfectly complimented the flavors.  For my main course I had the 9 oz. filet mignon and we all shared a few appetizers. Again, the lobster macaroni was insane! It really was a party in my mouth. My friend Alex was crazy about the creamed corn. I wasn't that impressed, but it was good.  Dessert was creme brulee and they served it with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate sauce. It was good and it was a very nice presentation. I jokingly asked if they were going to sing to me like at Applebee's. One of our servers didn't quite know how to answer me, so I tried to help by saying that we paid enough for them NOT to sing and that was okay.  The food was delicious and I really appreciated the terrific service. Everyone was very attentive and professional, but never stuffy. They made it seem effortless, making the experience that much better.",

    "text": "Do you want the good news or the bad news first?  I think I'll start with the good and sweeten up this review and then end it on a bitter note as this is how I feel about this steakhouse.  The ambience of this restaurant itself is classy, romantic and with the giant frog that pops out and starts singing over the waterfall...i'd even say magical.    Service was great.  Friendly servers who are able to make recommendations on the menu and wine list.  Our drinks were refilled and they checked on us just enough.  I saw them watching from afar ready to service us if we were in need of anything.  There were 5 of us in the party and plus tip we each paid $125.  We ordered the Maryland Blue Crab Cake, Kobe Beef Carpaccio, Filet Mignon, Bone in Rib Eye, Bone in New York, Chile Rubbed Rib Eye for 2 (42oz) and wine all around.  We also had the Au Gratin potatoes, mushrooms and 2 orders of the black truffled cream corn based on the servers recommendation.    I loved the crab cake.  It was made out of blue crab so the meat was sweet and full of crab flavor.  The crab cake was light, fluffy and cooked perfectly.  The carpaccio was okay.  I think i've had better carpaccio elsewhere.    I loved loved loved the Black truffle cream corn.  My favorite item of the evening.  This dish was divine.  Creamy, sweet, melt in your mouth delicious.  The mushrooms were also good but it's sauteed mushrooms...you really can't screw that up.  The bad news...which is the steak :(  I tried my hubby's filet mignon.  It was good but slightly cooked medium well about half the steak and the other half cooked perfectly at medium rare which he asked for.  Honestly, I think I cooked filet mignon once at home and we kept saying throughout dinner that it was amazing.  Yup, hands down I make a better steak than SW.  My friend ordered the bone in rib eye medium well but it came out well.  Not the slightest hint of pink at all.  That got sent back to the kitchen and a new piece of rib eye came out cooked medium well...but mainly in the center.  The sides were still medium well.    I shared the 42oz chile rub with my friend and that was only decent.  A good portion of the steak was uneatable as it was chewy and it had a lot of the muscle tendon tough stuff.  Only the middle part was good and even then it wasn't tender melt in your mouth steak.    Overall, I was bummed that we spent a bit of money here and the steak was just okay.  This is a steakhouse after all...but it did not rock my tastebuds.",

For the vegans, they take impeccable care to make sure you know what you can and can't eat - even bringing out vegan butter for the bread! I had the quinoa cakes (amazing), creamed spinach (pretty standard), and the sauteed mushrooms (can be made vegan). The mushrooms were the best I've ever had! The vegan dessert was also amazing.   The light shows start at 8:30, so try and get there at 7 or later to make sure you get to see them!   Will definitely be coming back to try the other vegan entrees soon.",

    "text": "Before I go with the bad, I'll start out with the good. Keep in mind this is my first high end steakhouse dinner and I did come on a Thursday night.    I went with a party of four, of course, with reservation. (2 ladies and 2 gentleman)  Hostess seated us promptly and near the fountain show view.  Ladies  shared 1 order rib-eye medium well.  It arrived 2 halves in 2 separate plates without our request.  We weren't complaining about that, we were surprised that they did it to save us the hassle of doing it our selves so kudos on that.      Gentleman's ordered the 40oz porterhouse medium rear for 2.  *First timers just to let you know this cut will be cooked on a bone and than be for you cut for you in slices in the kitchen for you.  Shared the Crab cake as a little appetizer.   Sides we've ordered Truffle cream corn, Broccoli, and SW Fries.  3 glasses of wine and ginger ale.  Came with 3 different kind of complimentary bread which was pretzel, bacon cheddar muffin, and some other bread.     Services was great. Everyone was prompt and fast.  They even folded the napkins back to the triangle as the ladies went to the restroom which I saw was a wow factor as I am an ordinary guy.  Waters were quickly refilled which out asking.  The view of the fountain is a pretty view.  But the show is kind of odd and usual.  I am not sure if they have different shows but the one I saw is about 2 balls floating on water making love than popping out a baby.  I am neutral about the show but, maybe it will bug others.  I will go in order.  Cheese and bacon and pretzel bread were both good and delicious. The other one was really chewy and hard. It came with butter and i believe it had some sort of black salt on the top.   Crab cakes - It was just okay to me. Yes it has big lumps of crab in it and it's non greasy but there is no wow factor in it.    The rib eye (about 1 inch thickness) the ladies ordered was salty due to the season they used as I am assuming it is some sort of salted crust seasoning.  It was to the point that the person who ate this steak had to start scraping off the seasoning. It also came out a little bit too well done for a medium well.  The porterhouse for 2 is about double the size of the rib eye in therms of thickness which was about 2 inches.  The first bite I took melted in my mouth but, I soon to realized that after the first piece i ate that the steak was not medium rear but medium.  To be sure it wasn't me I asked the person in which I shared the steak with, he said the same thing.  This steak was also coated with the salted crust but, since my steak was a little bit thicker it didn't seem as salty as the rib eye.  The truffle cream corn - truffley (not a word but made up lol) creamy and corns where blended up like baby food.  If i were to eat this as a side i would not be happy with it. BUT it came to the rescue to use as a \"steak sauce\" to help kill the saltiness of the steak.   The broccoli was tender and good but it was also extremely salty.    SW fries - good crispy and season with some spicy seasoning. But would not recommend as it is just fries.    Ginger ale was flat.  I have 2 stars docked off because half the food was simply just too salty.  Both of our steaks was over cooked.  For a steak house at this level and expense is simply unforgivable especially with a house half packed.  Sadly the wow factor in my experiences was not the food but, in the staff it self whom provided with great service.  Other thoughts i wanted to use my hand to finish off the t-bone lol but I didn't since i feel that this steak house is a classy steak house.   I'll update this when or if comeback to this steakhouse. Perhaps it is just my luck.",

The starter of tuna ceviche was well executed with a fantastic combination of flavours and textures. Whilst the crab liguine was absolutely delightful. The steaks were very good and cooked as requested, but overall I still prefer to eat the bife de lomo by Gaucho Grill over the steak that I had that evening, and actually any steak that I've eaten ever. The chocolate souffle was a bit of a let-down from what started off as a very promising night, but it was passable.  A $200+ bill for (2 starters, 2 mains, 2 sides, 1 dessert and large bottle of still water later) we left satisfied if not a whole lot lighter in the wallet.",

So, when I had called to reconfirm, I did mention that we had arranged an outdoor seating by the railing to watch the little shows that go on every half hour on the water.   Yeah, no! Once we walked in... I told the hostess my name (which she found in the system easily, since we were staying in the Encore to begin with). Next, right when she took us towards the outside seating area, she turned right back in and pointed us to a seat looking towards a wall located INSIDE the restaurant! WHAT?!?! I was pretty mad at this moment and said these are not the seats I had requested months prior when I called and reserved. She kept saying, others had misplaced that info from the system and that she wasn't sure about what I was referring to. So, I asked to speak to the manager... she looked at me and had a laughing smirk on her face while she went back to the front desk. As I got up to look to see if she was going to change our seats to an outdoor seating (which by the way was empty!) (supposedly reserved!!!) saw her point at my table where she sat us and started laughing with the manager. She then came by my table and said, \"I'm sorry, I have people that have booked in advance of 1 year, which are scheduled for tonight). Then she started laughing with a bitter smirk on her face again. At that moment, I just got up and walked out as my husband was shocked that what horrible service this was.  Yes, we have ate here before and I must tell you... The view from next to the railing is beautiful, yet the food is very close comparable to BJ's steaks. Lol! Cheap and heavy as they would say. HORRIBLE SERVICE and incredibly rude/non-professional management.  I DO NOT recommend anyone to waist their money here. There are better tasting food locations very close by, for a hint a really nice one in the Shops at the CRYSTALS! \"Ends with the word Ocean Club.\"  Rating: F- (1 STAR)",

This WOULD HAVE been the best steakhouse I've ever been to, but it sadly wasn't.  This evening, I wanted to treat my gf out to a great dinner before hitting up Zumanity.    As usual, we ran a few minutes late, but 10 minutes isn't anything to fuss over at 99.9% of restaurants.  However, it took them over THIRTY minutes to seat us.  Umm...with a show we don't want to be late for, that's some crumby management of tables.  For the most part, the service was top notch and the sommelier was great.  For dinner we ordered the chateaubriand, the foir gras torchon, an iceberg salad, spinach and mushroom sides, and a great Bordeaux wine.  The food was, for the most part, SUPERB.  Even the sides were as decadent as the main entree.  I just wish we had had more time.  The meat in the chateaubriand was juicy, tender, and everything one could hope for as far as red meat goes.  The foie gras torchon was excellent, just a little rich for my palate.  I've had foie gras every way you could have it and honestly, I prefer pan seared.  In the end, we had a rushed dinner because of being seated late, getting the check took forever because of some \"system problem\", and we ended up being late to Zumanity!  GRRRR!  It ended up being okay though, because when we got there, one of the \"actors\" gave us shit about being late, but after we explained what happened, he hooked us up with front row/couch seats!  Thanks, SW for the Cirque upgrade, I guess...",

Yes I know its a steakhouse but this was pretty amazing... never had anything like it. The waiters were extremely nice and helpful when talking about the dishes and helping us decide on how/what to order. Overall: Positive: Amazing food, AMAZING steak (had some of my friend's), very good deserts and a great staff. Negative: Expensive, and be warned - There are 2 Wagyu beef specials that we saw... one for $22 one for $150... we ordered just the Wagyu beef. Guess which one they assumed?? Dont get me wrong... it was amazing, but just mind what you order!",

We had a beautiful table on the terrace that we had.  requested, and exceptional service and suggestions. My mom likes her filet well done (sinful, I know) but they were able to cook it through without butter flying and she said it was the best steak of her life (and that means something coming from her!). All of the food was served sizzling hot and in an excellent manner. We had a show to see but wanted to return after dinner for dessert and to watch the Lake of Dreams. We returned around 10 pm and the hostess informed us that she couldn't seat on the terrace just for dessert and cocktails. But then our savior Corey walked by and welcomed us back warmly, and lo and behold we got an amazing table on the terrace to enjoy our cocktails and chocolate souffle! It was a perfect experience top to bottom and I will definitely recommend SW to others as well as return one day soon! Thanks Corey and Phillip!",

Service here is also great our waiter was Chris and he did a great job. Definitely the best steakhouse in Vegas.   P. S. Make reservations as soon as possible if you plan on coming here.",

The ambiance here is just perfect as it is able to handle large groups with ease and cater to the romantic date nights.  Outdoor seating overlooks the waterfall and when the sunsets, the background is illuminated with multicolored pine trees that fade in and out with different hues every few minutes.   It's absolutely gorgeous.   The service here is impeccable.  We had a table for 8 and when a friend arrived last minute they instantly moved us to a table of 10 during a busy Saturday night.   Now lets talk about the food.   For starters, I ordered the Foie Gras Torchon.  This dish is absolutely perfect as the bourbon macerated cherries complements the foie gras to give it the right balance.  Amazing.   I ordered the Bone In New York, medium rare and it came out perfect.   I did ask for the Trio of Sauces (Bearnaise, Jalapeno Tropical Fruit, SW Original) and trust me you do not need them.   The True stand out is the side dishes.     Here's the overall ratings:  Foie Gras Torchon: 6/5 - thats right 6 out of 5! Truffled cream corn: 5/5 - you have to order this Parmesan Creamed Spinach: 4/5  Au Gratin Potatoes: 4/5 Bone in New York (Medium Rare): 5/5 Roasted Sonoma Foie Gras; 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Price: $$$$!",

    "text": "Very dissapointed in my visit to SW Steakhouse.  I made reservations 2 months ago for our anniversary and requested outdoor seating.  When we got to the restaurant they told me that wasn't on the reservation and tried to sit us inside in the corner.  My husband requested outside and they told us it would be a 1 hour wait.  We ended up waiting 30 minutes and they still ended up seating us inside.  Our service was awful.  We weren't drinking because I'm pregnant and my husband is training for a triathlon and I think the waiter was bugged that our bill wouldn't be as much.   After we finished our appetizer which was the lemon marinated shrimp we waited way too long for our entree.  Our waiter came by and filled up our drinks and didn't say a thing about our food so my husband asked is our entrees almost ready?  Then he said I will go check on it.   Our waiter was AWFUL and our food was ok.  During our dinner they sat a table of 15-20 next to us and we couldn't hear ourselves talk.  So much for a romantic anniversary dinner.  I will never go back to SW and I don't reccommend it to anyone.  There are much better steakhouses to eat at in Vegas.",

It was perfectly seared so it had a nice crisp outside with a smooth, tender center. Perfectly cooked.  I also had the shrimp cocktail which only consisted of 3 shrimp, but they were huge.  For sides we had the creamed corn, potatoes au gratin, and the fries. All were very good. I don't really think its possible to have desert unless you are planing on it the whole time since the first few courses are likely to fill you up.  Overall, it was a great meal and as long as I can afford it, I would probably go again.",

When we get there right on time, hostess makes us wait over an hour and says that our reservation was actually for a later time. She was not apologetic at all and acted like she was doing me a favor allowing me to eat and pay the outrageous prices. Finally, we were sat at a table in the corner of the restaurant completely separated from the main dining room. We could not see the other patrons or the water show as it was blocked by pillars and silly plants that covered out view. It took half an hour for the waitress to come to take out order and another half hour to bring our drinks. By the time  the food came, we were already exhausted from waiting and had to eat cold undercooked meat. We asked for a hot plate, so we could at least make sure the food didn't get colder but never received that either. At the end when the bill comes, we were charged for drinks that we never ordered. And again the staff could care less to accommodate us. We love the Wynn hotel, but this was a below standard, that we will never home back!!!!! Mr. Wynn, time to start checking in on your restaurant and staff. Disappointing.",

As you can tell by the other reviews it has a ton of good options for a meat eater. In fact if you enjoy steak there is nothing you can do wrong here. The only thing might be not eating steak..... and that just makes you stupid. SW steakhouse is one of the most delightful restaurants I have ever had the pleasure to attend. The food is phenomenal, from start to finish. The steaks are obviously well prepared with a nice char on the outside and a melt in your mouth center. The NY strip was particularly delightful.  If your confused the staff works in teams and can easily point you to what your looking for with just a few simple questions.  I can't say much bad about this place other than  BEER. Where are your craft beers... It in truth, this is not their fault cause almost in all of Vegas, craft beer is missing. Well anyway this review is too be shuffled with the rest so if you'd like the abridged version.....  TLDR:   BE SURE TO TRY SW Steakhouse! If you don't you have made an error.",

The food was just OK for me. Husband had chili-rubbed ribeye & I had the butter poached lobsters. For sides: potatoes au gratin, creamed corn & sauteed mushrooms.  We also shared the crab cake appetizer. Everything was just \"pretty good\". Nothing \"WOW\"'d me...and I REALLY wanted it to. I think, honestly, it's because we went to Wolfgang Puck's CUT Las Vegas a while back. It's a little more expensive but so wonderful...especially if you're celebrating a special occasion.  Spend a little more & go to CUT.... You'll thank me later!  ...And NO, Wolfgang Puck didn't pay me for this review, lol. I'm just being completely honest!!",

The creamed spinach was short on butter. The creamed corn was also watery but tasty.  Potatoes au gratin was OK, and my snow crab soup had a nice flavor but the crab was over cooked.  Nothing on the desert menu moved me enough to order any. That said, the ambience was fun, sit outside and watch the \"water show\", that was the best part of the meal.

Keep in mind this entire review is for the service at the bar.  First Impressions - the ambience for this restaurant is absolutely incredible. They have a huge waterfall nestled in a beautiful frame of trees and lights. This is a fantastic place for a romantic date.  The Spread - because we were going out later we split a ribeye and two sides, the creamed spinach and the macaroni and cheese. The steak was absolute heaven, one of the best I've ever had. I would eat here again in a heartbeat just to have more of that steak.  The Service - again, we dined at the bar. The bartender had a great sense of humor, was attentive, and made some great conversation with us. I see a lot of reviews that was disappointed in the service they received, but that was not our experience.  Overall - I would love to come here again with the reservation and sit in a proper table for the full dining experience. But we had a fantastic time and the food was amazing.

I wish I could elaborate a lot more on what I ordered but it was just a barrage of goodness.  I believe I ordered this: Chile Rubbed Double Rib Eye (for two) While this was amazing, I sort of wish I got something more purist like a simple porterhouse or any bone-in cut without fancy spices. Whatever you end up ordering, it'll probably be amazing.  If you're serious about having a great dining experience here, be sure to make a reservation and dress correct. One time I tried to do a walk-in and I was wearing shorts and they weren't having it. You could probably do a walk-in and wait for a table but make sure you're dressed appropriately. If you're trying to get some that night, get a reservation at a table that directly views the artificial waterfall outside.  SW is the truth.",

My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint but rather an observation) is the Steaks are a bit large.  My right steak was 18 oz.  a friend of mine ordered the 42 oz porterhouse and yes, he finished it all.  Later he was in a \"food coma\" but that's another story.

My wife and I don't eat a ton so we usually split everything we order at a steakhouse to minimize leftovers and cost. This was no exception. However, it was one of the best meals either of us have had in a long time.   I started with a glass of Pinot Noir and my wife wasn't in a drinking mood (Vegas did it to her). We spooitna kale salad, 12oz filet, potatoes au gratin, and brussel sprouts. We had the best time sitting by the water and the staff was great! Highly recommend this restaurant if you're anywhere close to the Wynn!",

    "text": "What can I say about SW Steakhouse except that it's the whole package. Exceptional food, service and a magnificent and unique lagoon show. I had learned of SW from a fellow Yelpers review. I had made reservations weeks before and they only had a 9:45pm time slot available. The review mentioned the lagoon show started at 7:00pm so I thought I would surely have missed it. The evening could not have been more perfect. We sat outside lagoon front. I couldn't have asked for a better seat if I would have requested it. The lagoon and waterfall was stunning and shows are played every half hour and each 2 minute show has a different theme. SW Steakhouse is not just about the spectacular ambiance and show, they also offer top of the line steaks. For appetizer we started with the octopus which was served with a harissa sauce and garbanzos. The octopus was tender and the harissa sauce added a spicy punch to the dish. For entrees we had the NewYork Strip and a Crab Pasta. Both dishes were superb and for the show stopper we had the Rocky Road Dessert. The dessert is a chocolate dome, once a chocolate sauce is poured on top of the dome it melts away to reveal the rocky road dessert. The great reveal exposes ice cream, cake, and marshmallows. All and all SW Steakhouse is a must when visiting Las Vegas.   This definitely will not be my last visit. Can't wait for my return.",

They were good but priced too high     There is not a lot of prep work with boiled shrimp.  The side of lobster was okay.  Rubbery to chew.  They do prep the shell for easy removal of lobster meat.  We had to return the side of carrots. They were too salty and over cooked. They promptly replaced them with some fresh asparagus which were much better.  Upon receiving the bill, they charged me for both the carrots and asparagus.  They promptly corrected the error by removing the side of carrots charge.  I found the place to be a bit pretentious.  I will go back to Ruth's Chris as my go to steak restaurant.",

My personal favorites were the black truffle cream corn and wild mushroom. I was not too much of a fan of the steak choices. Also, I drinks have too much alcohol ratio.

We ended up ordering bone in steak and lobster for dinner,  and was comped out kobe beef appetizer and an amazing desert complimentary from the chef.    The meat was cooked to perfection and every bite had an amazing taste that didn't  require any added flavors, as for the lobster it was amazing in flavor and couldnt have asked for more.   Another added bonus to the amazing  dinner was the shows they put on every 30 min that keep you entertained and very unique.    Reason for the 4 star and not 5 was because our server was very bad at following  up on us during our meal, and we would have to flag down other waiters to get assistance.",

    "text": "SW Steakhouse is one of only three restaurants in the U.S. that offer certified authentic Kobe beef. That's why I selected this restaurant as my treat while in Vegas for my sister in law's wedding. To say I was excited to come here is an understatement. I specifically asked to reserve some Kobe. Expectations were at an all time high: could SW Steakhouse possibly deliver?  It's located inside the Wynn. They impressed me immediately. I arrived around 5:30 to gamble, so I had two hours to kill before my 7:30 reservation. Spur of the moment, I decided to head over to SW early, and as luck would have it, they were able to accommodate me. Sterling was very personable and asked me where I am from. Taylor brought me to my table and also chatted with me a bit. There is an aura about the customer service that you notice immediately when you are being serviced by a professional, courteous, and accomplished staff. Similar to other fine dining establishments (e.g. Mastro's), there is an unexplainable vibe that I feel when I dine here. I'm treated like a king; sometimes it almost makes me uncomfortable. I'm just a regular dude. I can see how some people would enjoy being pampered. I guess that's part of the appeal. When you're paying ridiculous prices, it comes with the territory. Multiple different porters filled my water glass constantly. My two servers always called me Mr. L. (my last name). This type of service really stands out, and I cannot compliment it enough. Since I began yelping, I rank the service at SW Steakhouse slightly above Mastro's and Houston's. It was purely exquisite, utterly professional, and wonderfully flattering.  Amy greeted me, and I went for the jugular right away (I asked about the Kobe). She wasn't sure if they had any. I explained that I came here specifically for the Kobe, and asked if they didn't have it, would another one of their restaurants (Mizumi)? She called upon my other server Mike to field my barrage of questions. At this point I was disappointed and panicking. I thought I was going to experience the mother of all wagyu, only to be let down and not even try it?  I think they were fearing that I would leave because I was not getting Kobe. I wasn't thinking of leaving, just trying to collect my thoughts after my hopes and dreams were shattered. Mike answered all of my questions in a polite and genuinely informative manner. He explained that their wagyu is from Steve Wynn's personal cattle in Japan. The marbling score is an 11 out of a possible 12, which is as high as any Kobe beef. (USDA Prime would fall between 5-8 on this scale.) He calmed my nerves and ultimately convinced me to try their A5 grade, marble score 11 wagyu. (Kobe is a specific type of wagyu.)  Exclusive outdoor seating showcases a waterfall show with all the colors of the rainbow.  This review marks the 2nd time I've hit the 5000 character limit (Gyu Kaku). So here's the rundown.  Bread basket - Bacon cheese muffins, pretzel, and classic bread. Great.  Complimentary butternut squash soup - Absolutely delicious. Beautiful flavor and perfectly hot temperature.  Hudson Valley foie gras - Now outlawed in California, a must-try. Superb. Rich, fatty, savory, luscious, magnificent.  Black truffle creamed corn - half order. Mealy, but tasty.  Sardinian Gnocchi: Burgundy truffle, Maine lobster, Parmesan cream - Delicious, creamy, rich, heavy, packed with flavor. Hearty and filling.  To my dismay, the truffles in the gnocchi and creamed corn were not impressive.  Mike asked what doneness I would like. I replied medium rare of course. He said the chef recommends medium in order to ensure that more of the beautifully marbled fat cooks down, melts, and infuses flavor into the meat.  A5 Grade, marble score 11, Ideue Farm, Kagoshima Prefecture Wagyu: 4 oz minimum, $176. $44 per additional oz. I was torn whether to get NY or ribeye when Mike told me I could do 2 oz each.  2 oz New York - Like eating butter. So flavorful and outstanding. Slightly less marbled than the ribeye. 2 oz ribeye - eye only, no cap. This was the single most marbled steak I've eaten in my entire life. Literallty melted in my mouth. Succulent, rich, gorgeous flavor. The best way I can describe it is I ate butter in the form of a steak.  Hawaiian volcanic black salt was available on my plate, along with veggies.  I need to win the lottery so I can eat like this all the time. It must be nice to be rich.  Did the Wagyu deliver? Aside from the initial shock and disappointment of not getting Kobe, the answer is yes. This was the most marbled steak I have ever consumed in my entire life. I highly enjoyed it; it was sensational, breathtaking, and scrumptious.  Would I come back? Absolutely.  The damage was $300 after tax and tip. Afterwards, I hit the casino floor in an attempt to recover some of the money I just spent. This is usually a bad idea, as it typically results in losing even more money. Read my Wynn review to find out what happened!",

It was not one of the hand massaged Beethoven listening cattle cuts, but this $56 bone in ribeye was good regardless.  However the most memorable item of the night was the creamed corn with truffle shavings.  I have thought about it everyday since our visit last week.  The scalloped potatoes were really good too.  I enjoyed the crab soup my wife did not.  It was a light tomato base soup I think, nothing creamy or overly filling.  The tomatoes on the wedge, or whatever they call it there, were quite an assortment of shape, color, and taste.  Service and decor were flawless, just like we witnessed throughout the entire hotel.  Its amazing how they bring elegance and intimacy to the middle of Vegas.  Definitely recommend this place.",

I wasn't expecting much as I'm used to Mastro, The Cut, etc.  But I was pretty much blown away by how tender the steak was. I got the filet while a couple of my girlfriends shared the rib eye.  No complaints from anyone at the table. The only reason why I give it 1 less of a star is because the sides are not as great.  The portions are small as well. We got the au gratin potatoes, cream of spinach, and the mushroom.  Out of the 3, I would have to say the au gratin potatoes wins the sides sections. Definitely a place to try out if you have the $$$ to afford a MINIMUM of $54 (filet only) + tax + tip.",

Decor was subdued but when you walk in, you know there's a theatrical feel to it --after all, the dining room walls and ceiling folds and lights changes every half hour! Hence, the name Switch Steakhouse (wink!). Service was up to par - since I did not write this review right when we came back -forgive me but I totally forgot what we had for appetizers-but I do remember we had no complaints! I do remember what the main meal was- filet mignon bone-in! with side dishes of wild mushrooms, veggies. Let me tell you that the meat was truly like butter! We also shared lobster tails - two medium size ones. Those were delicious also and cooked just right. Needless to say, no desserts for us! too full and happy---and yes, we did ok in Vegas--I actually did not even spend all my 'gambling allowance' but with $200 left over--hubby was ahead by about $300...so overall, a good trip over there. By the way, Wynn is beautiful and the room we had was really nice and large--service was very good.",

We had been wanting to visit for several years and finally decided to make it happen during this past visit to Vegas.    We arrived at our appointed time and the people at the hostess desk were less than friendly.    It took them a while to acknowledge us and seat us.   Once we were seated someone did come by promptly to take our drink orders.   He didn't identify himself so we assumed he was the person who would be waiting on us.   After our drinks and bread were delivered someone else came by and asked us if we knew what we wanted to order.   I asked him if he was our server since we thought the other gentleman was waiting on us and his reply was \"as long as someone waits on you.\"    He was very abrupt.  Never asked us if we had any questions on the menu and never explained anything.  Very disappointing.  Our orders consisted of:  special heirloom tomato salad, 1 1/2 pound king crab leg special, bone in New York strip, truffled creamed corn, onion rings and two glasses of wine.   The crab legs were broiled and didn't have much flavor.   The steak was wonderful along with the creamed corn.   We did not order dessert.   I would not go back to SW due to the poor service.   The decor is not that spectacular for the prices they charge.  I really wanted to like this place but not to be.  I gave it three stars since the steak was excellent and this is what they are known for.",

If you can arrange seating outside during sunset so you can watch the Lake of Dreams, then I would recommend it.  However, a huge warning, if you have a hard time being around cigarette smoke then sitting outside might not be the best idea.  Unfortunately, there is an outside bar right next to the restaurant which allows cigar smoking and the fumes waft over right into your table.  It was so bad, that we had to ask to be moved inside (yeah, were from California, so we got spoiled with the no-smoking laws).  However, the staff were so kind and accommodating that they immediately found us a table inside.  And what was very pleasing was the fact that even inside we still were able to see the Lake of Dreams show.  The quality of the food was marvelous and the filet was so tender I could literally cut it with my fork.  Enjoy",

    "text": "Part 2: Moving next to entrees and sides, the Wagyu passed over in favor of SW's signature Rib-Eye, a Dry Aged Bone-In Strip and the newly added Fish n' Chips, those unafraid of spice and bored with the typical Steakhouse cuts would be well advised to invest $125 in the 42oz Chile-Rubbed Steak with two Ribs and lots of Peppers and Onions, the flavors all playing well off juicy flesh still sizzling in its pan and every bite far more interesting than the $72 Bone-In that lacks in flavor compared to that at Carnevino, Jean-Georges or the recently opened MB|Steak at Hard Rock where the exact same 18oz portion can be had with better texture and richness for $14 less.   Underwhelmed by the Fish n' Chips, a smallish-filet of Halibut that is baked beneath a crust of Malt-Vinegar Potatoes and served alongside overcooked Hashbrown Sticks on a bed of Lemon Beurre Blanc, SW Steakhouse makes up for a lack of creativity in its sides by way of quality and luxury ingredients, the Potato Rosti on a pedestal with Chive Cream a showstopper by any definition while Creamed Corn is still thick enough to have a tooth, though probably a bit more impressive during Black Truffle season.  Not a fan of Walzog's Brussels Sprouts, the Crucifers coming across like soggy slaw rather than the crispy orbs served elsewhere, sides were completed by a late-arriving daily special of Semolina Gnocchi with chunks of Lobster and a few flakes of Summer Truffle in Parmesan Cream, the mixture expectedly rich though quite delicious and thankfully portioned large enough to go around considering the cost of $24.  Cleansing the palate with a double Espresso, its arrival nearly fifteen minutes before Dessert not exactly ideal but better than long after, it was with mild curiosity that the description of a $100 Louis XIII 23-Karat Gold Bar Dessert was read twice, the decision to place a premium on variety eventually seeing Pastry Chef Svetlana Almonte send forth a quartet of sweets tallying $54, the Coconut Tapioca fairly harmless with the Passion Fruit easily scooped aside while both the Bread Pudding and Peaches and Cream were elegantly presented with fresh Fruit, great textures and restrained sweetness, the $22 Funnel Cake and Strawberries largely served for show with the fried Dough hung from metal Branches above a trio of luxurious Sauces.  ***Arguably the most expensive house of grilled Meats in Las Vegas, a fairly inauspicious title considering the competition, SW Steakhouse is a perfectly acceptable choice for those looking to enjoy a Steak and quality sides, but in the era of every Casino having its own signature spin on the genre there is nothing here all that compelling save for lakeside setting and even that seems a little contrived when compared to the dining rooms at Costa di Mare or Mizumi.",

I was actually a little surprised, because last time we were here, the service was really rude and arrogant. We were so blown away by the experience this time, my doubts about SW have disappeared!   Our server, Anthony, was on the ball the entire meal. This really made the experience. He was around enough, but not too much. Friendly, but not too friendly.   To start, me and my brother shared the Caesar salad and my mom and dad shared the wedge salad. Both were perfect. The wedge salad had so much blue cheese, we were in blue cheese heaven. It paired nicely with the bread basket (which was also amazing).    I had the boneless rib eye, which was so so good. It was so juicy and perfectly cooked. Huge. But I had the table to help me finish it. We had it with the fries and hashbrown potato. The hashbrown (don't know if that's the official name), was made of shredded potatoes and looked like it was done in a skillet. Salty, crispy, amazing. The fries were also excellent. This was one of our favourite meals in Vegas.",

I only ended up doing the steak, but can't wait to go back to do a full-on dinner with starters, yada yada. What I can say is that the NY strip is....I mean, dayum. Daaaayuuuummmmm. It was too damn good. Did fries on the side and also dayyyyuuummmmmm.   The steak, which was not waygu...was just so gooooood. Like, it came out perfectly cooked and basically cut like warm butter. Dat cross-section is what we all strive for, I tell ya whut. Dem fries were the perfect crispiness of precision. The best, around. No one is gonna take 'em down.   The bar staff is awesome. They don't take no shit and dish it right out. Cool dudes.   It has also come to my attention that smoking is allowed in the outside dining area...which is my mistake not doing that from the get-go...cause it's going to fulfill my dream of eating a stupid ass-delicious steak with some silly grape drank (wine) after a few scotches while smoking a cigar in public all while discussing the finer points of international trade markets primarily in emerging markets for while wearing a top-hat and saying 'quite' way too many times in an imperialistic accent.   Okay...maybe no top hat.",

The service is top notch and you will have several very attentive members of the waitstaff at your table regularly - all very helpful.  Secondly, the food was spectacular. I think the appetizer selection was somewhat understated, but will have to try more to provide a fair assessment. As for the entrees, both were amazing. The Alaskan King Crab Legs with Orange-Tarragon Butter were the best dish we have had in the entire city. This is a unique take on your traditional crab legs and whoever invented it deserves EVERY award. The Chile-Rubbed Ribeye was a ton of steak for any one person, but was quite flavorful with a little heat.  This is a MUST for any Las Vegas foodie experience, and trust me... get the Crab Legs!",

I am also gluten free and I can say this restaurant went above and beyond on accommodating my allergy. They even had gluten free dinner rolls which were amazing. We had the tuna tatare appetizer and even though I was not crazy about the flavor it was still tasty. The scallops were really the high light of the meal. My boyfriend loved his filet but even said that he was amazed by how flavorful the scallops were. The black truffle sauce and risotto that sits underneath the scallops was heavenly and I honestly would have licked the plate if i was in my own house. We ended with a creme brulee desert and some espresso and that was very well prepared as well. Their wine list is also extensive we picked a featured bottle and enjoyed it. The ambiance of the restaurant is even above and beyond. We ate on the heated patio and really enjoyed the water show. I really cannot say enough good things about this place and as someone who has eaten at several fine dining establishments, SW really sets the bar high. Tempted to book a flight back to Vegas just to eat there again.",

We made reservations a few hours before for 7:30 on a Tuesday and were seated shortly after arrival. The bread they brought to the table was the best pre-dinner bread I've had! It included two pieces of three types of bread, one of which was cheese bread, amazing! (We actually got a second order of the bread just to take home.)  Our waiter explained a few things on the menu and suggested we order 2-3 sides to share with our steaks. We both got the dry aged bone-in New York strip. I usually get my steak medium-well but boyfriend convinced me to get it medium to \"not ruin it,\" fine fine... We settled on black truffle creamed corn and steak fries as the sides to share. The steaks were perfection, juicy and flavorful. The creamed corn was phenomenal and the fries were perfect (came with a side of bernaise sauce). Yum. We didn't finish all the food so requested to-go. They packed the food perfectly in separate containers for each item and included a separate container of butter and a set of utensils as well. So thoughtful! Loved this place and look forward to returning!",

We started with a Caesar Salad, which a a little kick to it with good flavor.

The bread alone should give this place 5 stars but high-end steak restaurants all serve high quality bread so in comparison I'd prefer another steak restaurant.

We ordered two entrees each plus Steve's chopped salad (best vegan chopped salad in the world). Everything was fantastic. To all vegans visiting Vegas, if you can get past the name, you should definitely eat here. You won't be disappointed.",

The food is very good but, the service is inconsistent served with a side dish of arrogance!   There are many wonderful place to eat both on and off the strip.  Go somewhere that appreciates their clientele and leaves the attitude at home.",

    "text": "Two important words: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!  I didn't know until after dining here and going on Wynn's site once I got home, but SW managed to receive the AAA four diamond award four consecutive years starting from 2008.  In one word, HOW?!  My friends and I were in Vegas last weekend to celebrate our birthdays.  After seeing SW on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\", my friend decided to have our dinner here since it was in walking distance because we were staying at the Encore.  LOCATION: Wynn Hotel, across from Chanel, overlooking the Lake of Dreams. Tip: Request a table outside on the patio because there are frog and light shows during dinner (I just learned this while dining)  FOOD: *Complimentary bread: Take a bacon cheese bread, spread the butter, sea salt, and olive oil brought to the table and enjoy!  *Porterhouse for Two (40oz, $106) - Ugh, our meat was overcooked past a medium rare.  Not knowing where SW was located, I called down to the front desk from our room and was told to try the Porterhouse because that's what SW was known for.  My friend offered to split the dish with me and it was so disappointing.  The steak lacked proper flavoring and probably all but one small piece (the very middle) was overcooked.    I wasn't the only one complaining my meat was overcooked.  Out of party of 7, only one was not overcooked.  My friend ate nearly a third of his steak before we convinced him to send it back.   SIDES: *Black Truffle Creamed Corn - Good and a must try!  I loved the sweetness of the dish. *Parmesan Creamed Spinach - Ok, but I think the spinach could've been cooked more. Pieces were still a bit crunchy. *Fingerling Potatoes, Green Beans - The green beans and bacon were good, nothing memorable about this. *Mac & Cheese - Ok, you usually can't mess up mac and cheese.  DESSERT: *Funnel Cake - Order it!!  It was delicious.  The presentation was beautiful with warm funnel cake pieces hanging on a tree branch setup.  The funnel cake is meant to be dipped in one of the three accompanying sauces: vanilla, chocolate, or caramel.  Sadly, dessert was the best part of my meal at a steakhouse.  SERVICE: While our waitress did her typical duties of taking our order, she was MIA most of the time.  She did not check up on us but found that if we wanted her attention, we had to wave our hands in the air.  This happened NOT once, but twice.  The second time, my friend said his steak was overcooked and she said she would take care of.  She then looked at the rest of our table and asked if everyone else's was cooked to our liking with a snippy tone of voice.  I did not appreciate her tone of voice nor her lacking in the customer service/waitressing department.  The servers on the other hand were great and constantly kept our water glasses filled.  AMBIANCE: Like I've said before, request a table on the patio.  Every so often they have light shows on the patio water area.  The frog show was odd, the colors were beautiful (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ&select=q6IWl2qWin2aAxdmYtDnZQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).  The noise level wasn't loud and you were able to hear conversations.",

Our order began close to 8:00 p.m. What tied me over and had me happy was the unexpected pretzel bread!  OMG!! SO GOOD!! I usually only eat a bite to taste or one piece. Once you smell and then taste the pretzel bread, you cave. We all did!! We had to ask for more!! (And I went back the next day just for the pretzel bread (via having a drink in the bar)!!   The entire meal was very good!! My entree was the all natural filet mignon cooked medium rare. It arrived as two 4 oz cuts which I loved as I got full on the pretzel bread and could only eat one of the filet mignon cuts. The next day I pulled the left over filet cut from the hotel room fridge and ate it cold. It was still just as amazing!!!!   Will certainly be back!! Tasting it as I type this review.  Thank you SW!!!  BTW: Would really love to know how to make the pretzel bread!! : )",

    "text": "Definitely try to get a seat by the fountain out on the patio. Let's put it this way, they have weird, funny, somewhat entertaining things going on while you eat. Call days in advance for a reservation!!  I LOVE their steak!!! So why the 4 stars? First, the service was not stellar. I think we just got a bad waiter during our last visit (the first time we went a year ago, we had amazing service). He didn't care to give us drink menus, and when we asked we got only one drink menu and not the wine list. He didn't care to give us bread until we asked. He rarely came by at all. We had other people come by pouring us water and things but honestly, I think we only saw him again when it came time to pay the bill. I totally expect more from an expensive steakhouse like this one.  Second, their side dishes are amazing....but their mac & cheese sucked. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it could be the worst mac & cheese I have ever eaten at a high end restaurant like this. Boo. And I love mac & cheese.  With that said, like I said, I LOVE their steak. I like it better than The Prime, Sinatra, STK and maybe even Craft (but I really did love Craft too).  Despite their mediocre service, which I think was a fluke, and their not-so-hot mac & cheese, I will DEFINITELY be back. Their steaks are that good.",

The food is terrific even if classic steakhouse fare. The Oysters were FOB and a great way to start. Typical salad selection but I thought the chopped was the way to go. Wedge you can get anywhere and Caesar will never be outstanding when not made table side, which it is not. Have had the steaks here many times, which are first class so went with the lamb chops. Very tasty and perfectly cooked. Wine list is over priced but that is a consistent feature of every hotel restaurant, particularly in Las Vegas. Good selection though so while you will pay through the nose, at least you can get a really nice bottle.",

Ceasar salad = to die for.The potatoes au gratin were amazing. The creamed corn was soo good. The funnel cake and creme brulee were insane. Holy shit the creme brulee was magical.

    "text": "2014- this visit was very disappointing. Last time here Stephanie the hostess was fantastic. This time we walk in at 10:10, we had 9:30 reservations but were doing good in the casino and didn't want to leave. The hostess tells us you have to hurry and sit down the kitchen closes at 10:15 and we're like WHAT?  This is Vegas how can u close a kitchen at 10:15.   So we were like should we leave and the hostess was like no it's ok as long as you order by 10:15 you're ok. Well we sat down and we were like stressed out that we had to rush, that our food would be cooked by the dishwasher cause the chef got off work at 10:15. Or the food would be all rushed out at once. It was very unsettling to start the meal off this way..  Our servers were great they calmed us down and made us feel a lot more comfortable. BUT the damage was done.   Now for the food. The FoiGras was fantastic as usual, the bread and sea salted butter was fantastic. However the steaks came up way short. This is by no means a cheap meal! And the quality of the meat should be at the highest level and it is NOT. I ordered bone in ribeye and while it was cooked to perfection it was very chewy. So I sent it back and got the NY Strip and it was better but very pedestrian. It was definitely not a wow. My buddy ordered the filet and it was ok and nothing more.  To me the steak is not premium grade its more like a select choice and for the price it should be select premium. This is supermarket quality meat and not gourmet supermarket either!  I've decided to find a new steakhouse.  Will try Craft and Carnivore and see which will replace SW as my Vegas steakhouse.  SW I bid you a sad Adou   2012 What a great dinning experience from the very lovely hostess Stephanie to the final desert course. We sat outside watched the show and had some great food with great friendly service. Met a very nice couple from NY that we had a great Dow port together after dinner.   Highly recommend you dine here if you're going out for an expensive dinner. Foi Gras was great, all our steaks were cooked to perfection and tender. Unlike aureole where you would end up spending the same amount of money for dog food.  I also recommend Strip Steak, the Kobe Steak is to die for.",

Patio seating is a must as the show is entertaining throughout dinner.  Reservations aren't easy to come by as this place is packed every night of the week.  I won't go into great detail about the food because after all it's a steakhouse and I'm sure you are a fan of steak if you are searching for a steakhouse.  I will share with you that you should smother your steak in the butter they provide you because just when you thought it couldn't get better, it does!  You can't go wrong with any of the side dishes (I especially love the Brussel sprouts).  The wine list is fantastic with plenty to choose from including by the glass.  I haven't tried any of the desserts but I watch in envy while everyone else enjoys them.  Service is phenomenal!  It's very easy to spend $400 on 2 people here.",

Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked medium rare with a perfect sear. Truly memorable. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is in my mind the wine pricing is over the top exorbitant.

I added a Maine Lobster to my steak - - it may have been the worst lobster I've had in decades - over cooked.  The caesar salad was what you would expect.  The octopus appetizer was over grilled - too crunchy (I'm guessing someone wasn't paying attention while cooking it).  The au gratin potatoes were among the best we've ever had...the baked fennel mac & cheese left a lot to be desired.  The cookie butter cheesecake is now among our favor desserts - it was simply delightful.",

The space itself is lovely and overlooks a waterfall and there is a bit of a show experience out there. I thought the dining room was a bit too bright which made it less romantic than I was expecting. The sommelier helped us pick a delicious bottle of red wine and then we ordered our meals. My appetizer was a special they had which was a grilled octopus over chickpeas and tomatoes, it was nice and light. My boyfriend had a crab cake that was to die for! Oh by the way, our bread basket was easily one of the highlights of the meal- it had 3 different kinds of bread and they were all wonderful. I ordered a Filet Mignon medium rare and it was just perfect, perfectly cooked and the sauce on the side was the perfect compliment. I also ordered a side of the sauteed vegetables but unfortunately they were hard and undercooked. My boyfriend ordered a side of macaroni and cheese with bacon which I tried and it was very good. For dessert I had a trio of gelatos and sorbets which I was able to choose from several options, and they were unbelievable! My 2 favorites were the banana ice cream and the coconut sorbet, really rich and delicious. The chocolate was just ok, not quite sweet enough. Our service was very good and I definitely enjoyed this meal.",

The lighted waterfall with accompanying music makes for a lovely visual, but when the rib eye is $62 the meat needs to be as good as the view.  It wasn't.  The rib eye was average.  The scallops were good, but they were served on a bed of bland rice.  Perhaps this is a personal preference, but I like the kernels in my creamed corn to be nearly whole so that there is a bit of crunch and pop in each bite.  The SW's creamed corn is cut so fine it may as well have already been chewed.  On the bright side, the wedge salad was good and came with a delightful side of bacon.   The SW is a nice evening out if you don't mind the price and have average expectations for the food.  It is form over substance.",

The View = We requested to sit by the window so we can enjoy the entertainment from \"The Lake\". But we were disappointed, the so call \"show\" was kinda ridiculous.   Anyway on to the food.  Crabcake: Crispy on the outside with lumps of crab on the inside. Delicious but the portion is small. Not worth the price.  Lamb Chop with a side of Truffle Creamed Corn: Delicious, it was the best lamb chop I've had. It's so tender and flavorful.   Filet Mignon with Foie Gras: The Foie Gras is a must try. I was kinda disappointed at the Filet Mignon. I ordered medium but it's still kinda dry and rough. Ruth's Chris is so much better.  The food are overall decent but it's way over priced.

The bartender made a special blueberry drink (off menu) with fresh blueberries for my wife due to her desire for a blueberry drink.  The hostesses were extremely friendly and their attire was appropriate to upscale dining / classic Vegas.  Our waiter was very good.  He was attentive and offered good suggestions / engaging conversation without becoming a member of the party.  The food was out of this world!! We ordered the Porterhouse for Two.  No need for a steak knife because it was cooked to perfection and fork tender.  The side dishes were just as wonderful.  Be careful of the bread basket. The bread basket offerings were the best we have ever had at any restaurant or bakery.  Pretty big deal for us since we usually have little / no interest in bread with dinner.  We ordered one dessert for my wife's birthday. It was very good as well but we could only eat a spoonful since we had already enjoyed a hearty / wonderful dinner.  Mr. Wynn and his team really know their craft.  This is now one of our top 3 favorite destinations for steak.  We highly recommend for an adult evening out with great food.",

I requested a table with a good view of the lake and they made sure we were right in front with an excellent view.  The front desk attendant was a little dry, but out waiter and good runners were awesome!  The food was excellent... My ribeye was delicious and my wife's filet was more pink that she normally orders but she and I both loved it (literally melts in your mouth it's so good).  We also shared a Cesar salad which was tasty (but not necessarily incredible), potatoes au gratin which were amazing, a half order of black truffle creamed corn, asparagus, and Mac and cheese which were also all excellent. We wanted to sample a number of sides so out waiter recommended that we do half orders instead of full which was a great suggestion and not something advertised on the menu as an option. Even the half portions were really large.  I also really liked some of the small touches that made the whole experience special... The assorted breads and salted butter were great, the after dinner chocolate mints, the tasty beer selections and drink options, and of course the beauty of the lake and the randomness of the shows every half hour.  We have decided that we will be back every time we decide to visit Vegas. Thanks SW for a great dinner!",

Get over yourselves, SW.  Understand the desire to keep riff raff out... But it's vegas and yokels aren't gonna drop $200+ per person.    Service was painfully slow --- was asked 3 times for drinks ... We had questions for the sommelier and they all said they would get him (looked really uncoordinated).  Wine (silver oak), Steaks, salad, and apps (foie) were solid.  Eat at a lot of steakhouses ... Had a better bone in ribeye at Emerils Delmonico the day before.  Post dinner we wanted a particular bourbon from a bar in the Wynn that we went to prior  --- one server said he would get it.  Guy comes back and says it doesn't exist anywhere in the casino.  Said he checked everywhere and even made calls to try to locate it.  A buddy walks out, gets the bourbon, takes a pic of the bottle, and shows it to the server ...who then shot out a bunch of lame excuses about how he couldn't find it.  You can easily do better in Vegas.",

    "text": "We ate here on 9/21 our 1 year anniversary + honeymoon trip in one. I called a week prior to make outside table reservations and was told it would be no problem to accommodate us, especially being our anniversary. When we arrived I noticed several available seats on the patio as well as the inside of the restaurant was virtually vacant. The hostess proceeded to take us to the farthest back corner of the restaurant (inside). I asked her very politely about an outside table or at least one closer so we could have a nice view. She said (somewhat rudely) they were all booked. We were dressed very nice, we were polite, we had a glass of wine in the bar before, so not sure what the issue is unless the hostess need to be slipped $$ to get a nice table!   After sitting for about 45min in our private back corner, we were told they would have a table opening up closer if we wanted to move. The whole restaurant still seemed pretty open to me, but okay, we moved. After getting seated at our new table 2 waiters as well as the hostess made sure to come by our table and \"comment\" that we had moved. Again the hostess was snotty about it. Made us feel uncomfortable.   The service was slow especially since the place was empty. Staff just standing around. We ordered salmon and chicken. Salmon was WAY under cooked, chicken was very tender but had little to no flavor. We also ordered mashed potatoes, and the waitress offered us garlic mashed, we said yes. Once they came we quickly realized the garlic had not been cooked, it was mixed in raw and they were large chunks! It was instant dragon breath and we love garlic!  For $15/glass of wine, I would expect better. I had the pinot grigio. Maybe thats just because I live in wine country.   The bread basket should get 5 stars! They bacon cheese and pretzel breads were amazing!   All in all I wish we would have chosen the Eiffel Tower restaurant or the Billagio overlooking the fountains. Very disappointing memories made at SW Steakhouse.",

Very romantic scenery, however, not very intimate as you have to shout at each other in order to hear over the noise of the waterfall and everything else around.  The service was very friendly and accommodating. We had some trouble deciding on the wine and they offered us samples before we made our choices. Water was always refilled, plates cleared and server checked in regularly.   The bread basket was DELICIOUS. I started off with the appetizer of oysters on a half shell which were amazing. My entree was the pan roasted sea scallops which were cooked to perfection. The risotto complemented the dish incredibly. Boyfriend opted for the Snapper dish which I don't see on the online menu. That was tasty, but I was much more pleased with my selection. We shared a side of the black truffle creamed corn just because it had such rave reviews. It was fine. I did not find it as orgasmic as others seem to have, but it was tasty nevertheless.  Dress code seems to be strictly enforced.  Very enjoyable meal worth every penny.",

Especially those that have been exposed to all things sinful about Vegas. Everything from the dishes to the view from the terrace were beautifully presented.  Service was top-notch. The waitstaff were polite and friendly, yet professional. They answered all of the questions that our party had although I had already had my heart set on something in particular due to a previous visit: a medium rare bone-in rib eye with sauteed Sonoma foie gras. We also shared the black truffle creamed corn and the potato au gratin.   First off, the bread basket of was pretty good. It came paired with sea salt crusted butter and consisted of pretzel loaves, cheddar/bacon biscuits, and some other bread I didn't sample for fear of overstuffing.  As for my entree, the foie gras was deliciously buttery with gorgeous dark golden sears on both sides. My steak was well seasoned and tender. Not the best steak I've ever had but it definitely ranked in the top 10. The creamed corn was savory with subtle notes of black truffle. It was absolutely delicious! The potato au gratin was mediocre and nothing to write home about. My counterparts had the NY strip and the 40 oz. chile rubbed rib-eye which they seemed to enjoy.  It was definitely quite an enjoyable meal so why the deduction of 1 star? My steak was served a tad over medium when I had requested medium-rare. Tsk tsk.",

The butter taste was overwhelming and the meat tasted tough   The ribeye wasn't seasoned well, a bit bland and also overwhelming butter taste.   Stake tar tar was mediocre. Nothing to write home about.   Overall - good Decor, but overall does not live up to the Steve Wynn reputation.",

I believe is more for the name & location, not really the food & service. 4/4 of our med rare steaks were burnt, it might be the flames are too high to begun with. Our friends says it happened to them numerous times. The Salmon that our friend had was delicious, chop salad & crab cocktails were pretty good. Cocktails were on point!

    "text": "SW Steakhouse is located in The Wynn on the Las Vegas strip. We've heard lots of award winning, top notch reviews and had to check this place out. And what better occasion as one of my besties and her sister were staying at The Wynn.  The Wynn in itself has always been an eye catching, jaw dropping, elegant, classy, beautiful hotel!  SW Steakhouse is no different and fits perfectly into the character of this hotel!  So much to say, where do I start? SW is located down the escalators of this beautiful hotel closest to the south entrance doors, or valet doors. The second you walk through the restaurant doors there is the bar/lounge area to your left. There were flat screen TV's showcasing this evenings NBA prime time games.  As we walked further in we were greeted by our friendly and welcoming hosts! As we were heading to our table, this restaurant is huge, beautiful! This place is very elegant and very classy!  I read prior to making our reservation that this steakhouse is amongst the best in Las Vegas! \"Chef David Walzog's Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star Award-winning SW Steakhouse offers steaks that are unparalleled in Las Vegas\", as quoted.  As an FYI, the inside seating area is non-smoking,  while outside they do allow smoking. We were seated at the edge, just inside, but had a panoramic view of the lake and waterfall looking out. Yes, there is entertainment during your dining experience, which I think runs every 15 minutes on the lake and above the waterfall.  A True dining experience!  The dishes are priced four bills ($$$$), but this is not your ordinary steakhouse! The wine menu is a book, literally! I love my wines and champagnes, however, even I had to ask our servers there were so many to choose from! The cocktail menu was its own hook as well! LOL  The dinner featured the highest quality meats and seafood, complimented by a wide array of side dishes and homemade sauces! For you vegetarians and vegans, the menu is very accommodating to you as well! Just because this a steakhouse doesn't mean you too can't enjoy dining here!  Our dishes were creations of masterpieces!  I've dined at a lot of steakhouses but this night was an unforgettable experience! Dining at its finest!  We started with the house salad with two types of dressings on the side, a vinaigrette and a wasabi cream dressing! The dressings were really delicious!  For our main entrees, we ordered the 18 oz. Boneless Ribeye and 9 oz. Filet Mignon and shared amongst us three. Accompanying our steaks were six (6) house prepared sauces! Gosh, what an experience! Forbes rates this place 4-star experience, but my review of the SW is a 5-star experience!  To compliment our steaks, we ordered the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms, Roasted Jumbo Asparagus and a HUGE stuffed baked potato with everything on it! The highlight of the stuffed baked potato is it had real bacon or pork belly! Mouthwateringly Wow! And of course I can't forget that bread basket! Such a wide array of deliciousness!  We were so stuffed we didn't order any desserts, although they looked very tempting! Were we celebrating a birthday in our group so we were able to share what appeared to look like a macaroon but was a chocolate cake filled with peanut butter inside! Yummy!!   Overall, this was a wonderful night with wonderful friends, wonderful staff all around! I look forward to my next experience here!!! This experience rates a 5-star review in my book, and I look forward to my next experience here!!!   If you are ever at The Wynn, be sure to check out SW Restaurant! This is an experience to experience!!! :)",

    "text": "I went here with two of my girlfriends for my birthday dinner and I was impressed! The steakhouse is beautiful, we got to sit outside that provided us a view of the waterfall. It was absolutely beautiful! We had two servers, they were both attentive and made the experience very pleasant.   I ordered the all natural 8oz filet since it said it was only 240 calories... which I really appreciated considering I'm watching my diet. I wouldn't say it was the best steak, but probably because it tasted \"healthy\". I also ordered the truffled cream corn which was probably my favorite dish of the night! I paired my meal with a glass of Cabernet which the server generously comped (I noticed when I was paying the bill)! We also shared the chocolate lava cake which wasn't the best that I've tried but it was still good!   As we were eating, the waterfall show would come on probably every 15 minutes or so. It's a genius idea to enjoy a show while enjoying your steak, however, the themes were a bit weird and didn't really go well with the atmosphere of the steakhouse.   All in all, I would definitely come back to try their scallops, since I've seen many raves about it. If you're looking for a romantic, date night dinner, come give this place a try!",

When we checked in the gentleman at the front told us to hold to wait as I requested outside and was willing to wait. A table opened up right in the middle and in between inside and outside. Perfect.  The water, music, light shows were great. The atmosphere was phenomenal and very enjoyable. Got a drink at the bar first and Billy was a cool guy who got along with everyone and made a great drink. Super friendly and personalized the experience, which was great   The bread assortment and flavored butter were a nice start to the meal. We got the domestic wagyu New York strip and split it and crisp potato rosti along with the baked fennel Mac and cheese. Our server Andres was attentive, very nice, suggested and agreed with our food selection when I asked questions or recommended other items as well. And he smiled throughout serving us.   Overall experience, food, quality, ambience, staff service, and accommodations met and expectations. I'm glad I was able to eat here and I will again.",

We sat out in the patio area overlooking the lake and the big screen that features different songs with some cool graphics and a singing frog. They have outdoor heaters so we were very comfortable.   We started with shrimp cocktails and a lobster bisque. The shrimp cocktail consisted of four HUGE shrimps. They were so delicious. For dinner we ordered two of the porterhouse steaks (split between four people) and the scallops. Hands down, this was the best steak I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection with a nice char on the outside. The side dishes we chose were the carrots, asparagus and whipped potatoes. Also really good but there is no doubt that the steak was the star of the show.  For dessert we ordered the creme brulee and the apple crisp. The creme brulee was fabulous. Just melted in your mouth. I didn't have the apple crisp but it looked amazing. It was also huge and is enough dessert for 4 people.    The service was impeccable. The servers circulate through the tables without missing a beat. There was never a need to ask for anything because they anticipated our needs ahead of time. I'm looking forward to dining here on our next trip. If you're looking for a fine dining experience, look no farther, SW is the place to go!!!",

    "text": "SW is pricey but our meal was well worth it.  We had dinner Friday night at SW.  The place was packed the entire time we were there.  I overheard a hostess say if you wanted a table on the patio overlooking the waterfall you need to make reservations 6 months in advance.  So, be advised if you are wanting that experience.  We had a view of the waterfall from our table, and the weather was nice so they opened the wall to allow the breeze in.  It's definitely a cool place to have a meal.  Service was great throughout the evening.  We had a team of guys helping our table, and we also utilized the sommelier, who was very friendly and helpful.  We gave him a price range and a couple of bottles that we liked, and he provided us with 2 great recommendations.  No attempt to upsell either, which given how nice SW is, that was refreshing.  You are going to get a bread basket with pretzel buns, another type of bread, and these cheesy, bacon rolls.  Ignore the other bread and have the cheesy bacon rolls!  Everyone at our table loved them and I am pretty sure we all had at least 2.  I know I did.  I know everyone says not to fill up on bread and that's certainly True, but these rolls are worth not ignoring the bread basket.  To start, I had the tuna tartare.  The tuna was of very good quality and fresh.  However, there were too many pickled veggies and not enough gochujang for my taste.  The veggie to tuna ratio was off, and the tuna should have been the star of the dish.  It was good to be sure, but the construction was off.  I split the 30 ounce tomahawk ribeye with another guy at the table, and we all shared the following sides:  black truffle creamed corn, au gratin potatoes, asparagus, and mushrooms.  The server advised us that steaks at SW have a crust, and he was right.  This thing was textbook.  It had a slight crunch without being acrid at all.  If this wasn't a perfect steak crust it was pretty damn close.  The beef was dry aged 28 days and had the flavor and depth you expect of a dry aged prime steak.  It was cooked perfectly as well.  It's not cheap but it's a repeat order should I return.  The asparagus and mushrooms were prepared simply.  You have to like both of these items to like these sides, because there was nothing added.  The au gratin potatoes were small but excellent.  We had a group of 5 and needed to order another batch.  They were seasoned well, appropriately cheesy, and had a great crust.  SW may be fancy, but this was a great version of a classic steakhouse side.    While the potatoes were good, the winner of the side derby goes to the black truffle creamed corn.  Everyone at the table loved this stuff.  It had a lot of truffle flavor but it wasn't overpowering the dish.  And, the corn was creamed well, it wasn't too thick, but also wasn't runny.  5 star side.  You are going to pay a bunch for a meal at SW, but if you're eating there you are at the Wynn.  Steve Wynn built his empire on luxury, not deals.  I can't believe it took me so long to get to this place, but I would return on a future trip for sure.",

Beautiful layout.   We were lucky enough to sit by the view of the show they put on at the pool every 30 minutes or so.  Food was absolutely delicious.  Not a single complaint.  Top notch service.  Celebrities sitting nearby and it is just all put together brilliantly.  Mr Wynn has outdone himself.    Prices are high but worth it for sure. It's impossible to get a table there on any given night.  We were lucky to have a great friend that helped us land a table on a Friday night.",

    "text": "This rating is based on our total experience, not the food.  We dined at the SW Steakhouse on January 17 for my 70th birthday.  Steve Wynn also dined there that evening. Not surprisingly, he had a prime table on the patio. But Steve also ensured that the tables on either side of him remained unoccupied while he was there. Thus, he deprived paying guests from sitting at two of the best tables in the restaurant. Steve loves our money, but when he sits his pompous privileged posterior down for dinner, he does not want any of us sitting near him. We learned of this after requesting another table to move away from rowdy diners. The restaurant refused to sit us at the empty table next to Mr. Wynn. When I asked to speak with Robert, the Manager, he would not even give us the courtesy to come to our table. I had to find him. His excuse for Wynn's selfishness: Security.   The $71 filets at SW Steakhouse were tender and perfectly cooked. The sides were disappointing. The service was fine but simply could not compare to the orchestrated extravaganza going on at the Wynn table. He should be embarrassed to have his staff fawn over him while nearby (but not too nearby) his customers are receiving average service for their $175/$200 per person dinners.",

SW was unbelievably fantastic; the food was memorable, and the service was the best we have had anywhere, and we have dined in great places around the world. We had the bone-in pepper ribeye; like all of their steaks, it is charred for a crispy crust, kind of Pittsburgh style, and absolutely succulent inside. I also suggest the Potato au gratin dish, and my son's salmon was equally tasty. Be sure to top off your desert with the funnel cake dessert- that was awesome! Thank you to managers Victoria and Robert and the staff for giving us an unforgettable experience. Very highly recommend.",

Cooked perfectly, seasoning is mind blowing, and I love that it comes with seared onions and peppers. Perfect for two people or one really hungry person.

Service was superb and so was the food. We started with the half order of the cold seafood platter and I loved everything served. The crab salad was particularly addictive. One thing my fella and I couldn't agree on was what appetizers we wanted to try, but have no fear, they offer half orders of all of these so we were able to try everything our heart's desired. My favorite was the creamed corn. I actually wish I had a full order of this side all to myself. It was rich and creamy and so delicious.   For our main course, I ordered the bone-in New York and my fella ordered the Bone-in ribeye. Mine was good, but I only ordered it since the birthday boy picked the ribeye that I usually choose and I don't like to order two of the same thing. The ribeye was the star of the show.   Perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth delicious. We tried to save room for dessert, but no luck. We were stuffed.   Everything was superb, I only wish the waterfall wasn't so loud. It's a nice view, but ever so loud and distracting. My ears were ringing by the end of the meal.",

Service is top notch and always with a smile. We had the kobe filet and kobe cap. My kobe filet was excellent though a bit undersalted. Unfortunately hubby had to send the kobe cap back as it was very chewy and inedible. Fortunately the replacement kobe eye was the best of the 3 kobe steaks and staff had no qualms about accomdating us.  Lobster truffle gnocchi was excellent. Personally i think truffle gnocchi would be excellent sans lobster.   Rocky road dessert is a must for chocoholics. Thank-you Wynn for a wonderful meal!",

I had never been to an SW before, and thought the prices were a little high, so I ordered a 9 ounce filet and a side that included Brussels sprouts. It's considered a modest order for the restaurant but still $150 with a drink. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite as well as the atmosphere. I definitely recommend dining at SW",

Let me start by saying this place definitely DELIVERED!!! From the reservations,  food, view and most importantly service. We were greeted by great host and was immediately taken to our seat. Our server Anthony was very knowledgeable and warmth towards us. He also have given us many options with the menu.  Ordered filet mignon and the tastey unique truffled cream corn. Yummy. Lets talk about the view, it can be hot if you sit outside but try to ask for inside by the window.  Waterfalls just bring a soft essence and soothing feel to the place. Overall experience is definitely memorable.  Thank you SW for making this trip very memorable and have changed my view to \"crowded\" Vegas.  Will definitely recommend and come back here with frienda and family.",

I let them know this was our 25th anniversary night. I requested a table on the patio as close to the water as possible. She said she couldn't guarantee where on the patio we would be but that we would be on the patio. I made the reservations just after they opened to make our chances a little better. Upon arriving the following evening the host started leading us to the back of the restaurant. I stopped him and said that I had reservations on the patio. He said that they could not seat us on the patio. I told him of my conversation with the concierge and he said sorry we are fully booked. I looked outside and I think maybe a couple tables were occupied. I told him I didn't want to sit inside and that we were leaving. I also thanked him for ruining our 25th anniversary. The smug SOB said and I quote \"You're welcome, have a great night\". If it hadn't been such a special occasion I would jumped down his throat but didn't want to ruin our evening. Will NEVER give them another chance. We walked over to Lakeside next door (same patio and view and almost identical menu) and asked it they by chance had any room on their patio for our dinner and explained our situation. They were very kind and gracious and sat us on the patio almost immediately. THAT is how your treat a guest.",

    "text": "Excellent first time at SW. Luckily, we were seated right next to the lake so the table location couldn't have been better. The house bread was great, with a nice piece of softened butter and Hawaiian sea salt to spread with it. For me, the clear winner of the sides we chose was the truffled creamed corn. The potatoes au gratin was delicious, but didn't wow me as much as the corn. The filet was excellent - perfectly cooked, charred, and seasoned. Unfortunately, dessert wasn't ordered because of how stuffed we were.  Service was also great, attentive but not overbearing. Ambiance could've been a little better. Outside, Top 40 music was playing a little loudly so that sorta diffused the \"upscale\" feeling of the restaurant. With the noise of the waterfall and the loud music, it detracted from the experience a little. That won't stop me from coming back though!",

We ordered shrimp cocktail as appetizer, hubby ordered filet mignon, medium, came out well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I ordered the scallop entree, it was delicious but a bit too salty for my liking. Overall the dining experience, the food, the ambience was nice. The missing one star was due to inconsistent service. We had 3 different people came by our table, one was rather \"cold\". However, Baracet, one of the servers, was wonderful and most definitely made our dinner more special tonight.",

    "text": "The ambiance, decor, and service in SW are near 5-stars. However, I had high expectations for the food which wasn't quite met.  I first ordered the cider off the menu, which was an English import. I home brew craft cider and beer, and have an extensive palate for these drinks. The cider was excellent, and among the best I've tasted. Light, dry, crisp, but refreshing. My main course was bone in rib eye with blue cheese topping. The steak was overcooked, and my dining partner who got the filet also had an overcooked steak. My theory is they sat too long on warming deck and cooked too far through. It takes a while to be served, because they bring out main dish and sides all at the same time, which may've led to dry overcooked steak. Also, the blue cheese completely over powered the steak. However, when eating portions not drowned in cheese, the meat still was quite bland. The steak was really a 2-star type eat you could get in downtown Vegas for $10. I finished with chocolate cheesecake, which was excellent. Thick and rich, with chunks of chocolate embedded in the cake. It was paired excellently with the cider.  Overall I got some good food and service, but I can't give more than 3-stars for a \"steakhouse\" that is not serving excellent steak.",

The Cesar salad has an awesome kick to it if you're just looking for something for yourself. The banana ice cream pie is hands down the best dessert on the menu. Now for the steaks, I've actually only ever got one type of steak here, but from others I've been told that the filet is good and the bone in rib eye is tough to beat. Personally, the Tomahawk Chop is where it's at. Light eaters, it can be split four ways, but if your like me and can put food away like a bear pre-hibernation, it can be a one man job.  On a non food related note, the restaurant overlooks the lake which plays cool water shows every 20ish minutes. And the main attraction of the shows, is the robotic frog which comes out over the waterfall and sings to everyone.",

I ate at the bar, basically facing the back wall of the bar, and so it's not the best ambiance. The bartenders were not very chatty and it is a relatively small area.  The dining area looks nice and somewhat upscale. I would lie to go back and sit in the dining room and try some other items. As far as steakhouses in Las Vegas go, this is one of the better ones with typical Vegas prices.  I would rank it better than DelMonico but not as good as Gordon Ramsey.",

Besides my perfectly aged and cooked steak, the appetizer (a gnocchi with bacon, truffles, and a parmesan cream sauce) was one of the best (and most decadent) plates of food I have ever eaten.  My wife had the Main lobster, which was perfectly prepared as well.  Really, everything from the bread (omg the bread is insanely good--they bring you a basket with 6 kinds of bread--it's all you can do to not eat the entire thing) to the entrees was so fantastic you wish you had a spare stomach.  As for the restaurant itself, it is surprisingly understated inside, but the balcony (where the concierge hooked us up with prime seats for our anniversary) is really special.  Service was spot on the entire night, and we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving (reservation).    One reviewer compared this to Prime at the Bellagio and I would have trouble separating the two in terms of quality.  Both are among the best steakhouses I have ever eaten at (food, ambiance, service).",

    "text": "I came here memorial weekend with my girlfriend.  I was not too impressed.  I don't know.  Maybe my expectations for the Wynn signature steakhouse were too high.    First of all, i told them I was vegan when i originally made the reservation, which was a week in advance. I was there a week before but had drinks at Parasol Up/Down and it looked fantastic.  The hostess said that they get a lot of vegan diners all the time and that the kitchen would have no problem accomodating me.   So we get there and we are nicely seated.  Our server, whom i had to tell i was vegan, had no idea what to serve me.  He kept asking me \"what do i want\"?  What do you mean what do i want, i was thinking?  He did have the chef come out and talk to me.  He decided to make me a vegan rissotto with peas and carrots with a grilled veggie plate.    OMG.  This was horrible.  I barely touched the rissotto.  And i LOVE rissotto.  It was just bland, had no flavor and was awful.  The grilled veggies were that.  Grilled veggies.  Not marinated.  Not seasoned.  It was veggies that I coulda bought and held over a gas oven myself.   The only thing that saved my meal was the Strawberry Funnel Cake.  This was delicious.  Which is the only reason why i gave a review of 3 stars versus 2.    I know i know.. you're probably thinking, why the hell would my vegan ass go to a steakhouse?  (1) HOT GUYS go to steakhouses and (2) the hostess ranted and raved that they could accomodate me and that they accomodate vegans all the time.    Um, Yeah... Thanks Steve Wynn, but no thanks!",

    "text": "We picked this restaurant purely on reviews to celebrate our anniversary with a great dinner and a show (La Reve). We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and were asked to wait in the lounge for a few minutes while our table was being prepared. We were greeted by name and congratulated on our anniversary (nice touch). Shortly, we were escorted to our table and seated outside by the edge of the lake...pretty nice spot.   The first person (Sommelier?) to approach us at our table took our drink order and stated our waiter, Mark, would be with us shortly. Mark appeared and ran down the menu for us. We decided to order two different steaks to share, a salad for each and a couple of sides. Our salads arrived and all I have to say is \"Mmmm\". I had the Baby Iceberg Salad. It arrived, plated beautifully, and the bacon was just perfect. Just a small note...Ask the waiters assistant (Ryan is on point) for just the pretzel bread and an extra dish of the butter (you will understand once you get it). As I was nearing the end of my salad, our steaks arrived. The rib eye was cooked ok, but the filet was over cooked. Now, when I go to what is ostensibly one of the best steak houses in town, what is the ONE think you would expect to be cooked perfectly....the steak. They did offer and I accepted to have it replace with one cooked to my liking but the second arrived a bit undercooked but having tickets to a show forced me to accept the second piece of meat. The au gratin potatoes were just average and the Black Truffled Creamed Corn was soupy and reminded me of grits.   The ambiance was nice as the waterfall changed smoothly though a rainbow of colors. The strange thing was the misplaced \"entertainment\" on and around the waterfall every thirty minutes. Really...a singing country frog?!? Not sure why the strange distraction. They could omit this sideshow and everyone would have an uninterrupted meal and not sit there scratching their heads.  Overall, I really would like to have reviewed this restaurant better but after spending $200 for two people to dine, EVERYTHING should have been perfect.",

    "text": "Let's start off with the good stuff: the shrimp cocktail had four huge delicious shrimp.  Also, the bread was very tasty (they had three different kinds, all good). Finally the water show was a lot of fun: of course it's not a real Vegas show or anything, but it definitely makes the meal more memorable.  Now for the not so good stuff.  My wife and I both ordered the grass-fed steak, and my wife ordered the healthy version of it.  The waiter screwed up and gave me a healthy version too. It was incredibly bland, even for me (and I love bland food normally).  Make sure you are very clear with your waitstaff; evidently they can't handle two people ordering the same dish differently.  I also ordered the \"Yukon gold\" potatoes.  I don't know what they think \"Yukon gold\" means at S&W, but to me it means buttery delicious potatoes. What I got instead was very light, very flavorless potatoes.  My wife liked them though.  Then there was the real disappointment of the night: the lobster I ordered with my steak.  It was so overcooked and over-sauced that it literally did not taste like lobster.  Honestly it tasted much closer to the generic cheap fish you get in fish sticks than it did to lobster ... and it cost $40!  As for the service it was ok, but kinda slow given how much the meal costs. The thing that really bugged me was that the waiter didn't once ask me how my meal was, not even after I left the entire lobster dish un-eaten!   Ultimately my bill was about $250, and I really could have gotten a better meal at Red Lobster or Black Angus.  No joke.  If you want a great Vegas steakhouse try Craft Steak instead: their Yukon gold potatoes are AMAZING (as is everything else there). S&W has a great free show, but it's not nearly good enough to justify the low quality food at extraordinary prices.",

I've been to quite a few steakhouses so when I review a steakhouse, I compare it to the likes of Del Monico's, Alexander's, N9ne, etc.   The atmosphere is nice. Not too loud and not a library. The decor is nice and I like the bar setting. The crowd seemed a bit more professional type. At this point, I was pretty excited about this experience since I have never been here. And then......our waiter showed up. Mind you he showed up at our table after about 10-15 minutes of us sitting there sipping on water. Right away he asked us if we were ready to order! Dude, we haven't even ordered a cocktail yet! My friend asked him to slow down and get a Sommelier. The Sommelier was nice, friendly and very helpful. When we finally ordered our food, the waiter kept looking around like he was being stalked by the mafia instead of paying attention to us as we're ordering. Frankly, I'm surprised our order arrived without any mistakes.  I had a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon. The bacon slice was amazing! I could have eaten a bowl of it. I then had the bone-in New York. It was cooked well but was lacking the charred outside which I so desire. It was a good steak nonetheless. I don't recall what I had for desert but I'm sure it was good.  Summary: Food was excellent but the service would keep me from going back there. When you pay $150/head for dinner, I expect great service which I'm used to getting at Del Monico's and N9ne. I don't think I'll be going back to SW (unless of course if someone else is paying).",

My father and I shared the Porterhouse for Two, which was a 40oz slab of pure awesomeness. Expensive, but definitely well worth it. My mom had the Pan Roast Scallops which came with four delicious and suspiciously large scallops. Even though the decor wasn't eye candy, the food was definitely perfect. I'd definitely come back whenever I get the chance.",

    "text": "When the waiter said the chile rubbed double ribeye was the best thing they have in his opinion, we had to get it. We thought one order per couple would be fine since the waiter said it was good for sharing, but it turned out to be a lot of food. I'm not complaining though, because it was the most memorable dinner during our trip. I loved every bite of the steak. The second best thing I did in my hotel bed was eat SW leftovers the next morning. Yummm. The foie gras was good but I could've done without it. All our sides were enjoyable in this order of favorite...truffled creamed corn, mac and cheese, steamed asparagus. I was just amazed by how good the bread was. Bacon cheese bread...there were two of these in the basket among some delicious pretzel and wheat bread. We were trying to be polite and civilized by saying no, you can have it...but everybody wanted the bacon cheese bread! It was so good they brought out another basket of it and so we had bacon cheese bread for all, and no one got hurt. Oh and chocolate mint on the way out, I discretely grabbed two for myself 0;D",

    "text": "Prior to our most recent trip to Las Vegas, my New York friends had been talking about SW Steakhouse non stop.  \"You have to try it, I can't wait to go back, best steakhouse ever\" and so on.  Either my expectations going in were way too high, or SW just didn't deliver this time.    Don't get me wrong, it's a very good, very expensive steakhouse.  But best ever?  To quote Jim Carrey from Liar, Liar, \"I've had better.\"  As for the \"value-for-the-money,\" let's just say that Terrell Owens is proving to be a better value to the Buffalo Bills.  Football fans know what I am talking about.  SW Steakhouse is located just below the main casino floor, overlooking the beautiful fountain (if you are lucky to get a table by the fountain).  We didn't.  The four of us were seated right in the middle of the room, at a large rectangular table with a snow white tablecloth.  The only view we had was that of the beautifully dressed women walking to and from their tables.  Yeah, I had no, ahem, beef with the sights.  Our waitress was incredibly chatty and helpful in the very beginning.  She answered all of our questions and replied to every special request with a cheerful \"That shouldn't be a problem.\"  We talked about steaks, discussed her second pregnancy and contemplated the role of mustard and horseradish in today's turbulent economic climate.  I am not exaggerating one bit.  However, towards the end of the meal, our waitress seemed to have disappeared altogether, resurfacing not nearly often enough to check up on us.  My friends brought 2 bottles of wine with them, and the sommelier gladly opened and decanted them . . . for a corkage fee of $50 a pop.  That's $100 in corkage fees alone, for those of you keeping score at home.  This is definitely on the higher end of the corkage range.  We ordered 4 appetizers ($16-$22 each).  I cannot speak to the quality of the shrimp cocktail or the crabcake due to my extreme aversion to shellfish.  I can speak, however, to the quantity: 3 jumbo shrimp and 1 crabcake, respectively.  That'll be $40, please.  The tuna and yellowtail tartar was by far my favorite appetizer, although the fish dish was simple and unoriginal.  The presentation was all Vegas, but the taste was . . . well, also all Vegas.  The chopped salad was refreshing but on the bland side.  We ordered three steaks: the 18-oz bone-in New York strip ($52), the tomahawk dry-aged 32-oz ribeye ($78) and their signature 42-oz chile rubbed double ribeye ($98).  The strip was mine, although my friends gave up on their steaks pretty quickly, so I got to try all of them.    The strip was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and all but melted in your mouth.  I should not have let my friends talk me into getting the jalapeno rub on my steak, however.  It was deceptively strong, and it overpowered any and all flavors of the $50 steak.  Although I am not a fan of ribeye, I have to say that theirs was delicious.  The dry aged ribeye was served on a gigantic bone hanging off the plate (cue The Flintstones music here).  The dry aging made the beef even more flavorful.  The chile rubbed ribeye was pan fried and juicy.  I was a little disappointed that the end pieces were FUBAR (fried up beyond all recognition).  Still, 5 big stars for the meat, with a 1/4 star deduction for the unnecessary jalapeno flavor.  The sides were $10 a pop, which is at the upper end of the range as well.  For $10 they were extremely small, and could hardly have been shared by 4 people.  The creamed corn with truffles tasted watery.  The mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin were good, but ordinary.  We shared two desserts, the chocolate souffle cake and the funnel cake.  The chocolate souffle was as uninspired as it gets; it tasted very rich but it was no different from any other chocolate souffle you'd get in any upscale restaurant.  The funnel cakes, on the other hand, were phenomenal.  Shaped like funnel donuts, they were hanging off the cast iron twigs set on the plate.  It's hard to describe, but it looked like a mini sculpture of twigs decorated with round funnel cakes.  Wow.  They were served with chocolate covered strawberries and 3 dipping sauces: chocolate, salted caramel and creme anglaise.  Oh man!  That funnel cake dipped in creme anglaise - yum!  It's not like the funnel cake you get at a ballpark or at a state fair.  I mean, sure, it's still fried dough and it's still bad for you, but that's where the similarities end.  Our dinner, including the corkage fee and the top cost us $580 or $145 per person.  I really enjoyed the steak and the funnel cakes, but SW is hardly worth the money.  I would take my business to Morton's, Del Frisco or Prime.",

Wife had the Caesar salad, which I got to taste.  Very simple, very classic, very well done.  The crouton was amazing.  I went for an appetizer special:  Tuscan salami and duck ham over greens and mushrooms.  The salami was excellent, but everything else seemed to be overly competitive on the plate.  There was a lot going on.  I didn't care for any of the sauces that they present with the steaks, but then again I rarely put anything on a steak these days aside from the tines of my fork.  I had a side of truffled creamed corn, which just didn't work for me.  I enjoy hints of flavors and found the truffle a bit over the top and overwhelming.  Wife had the beef short ribs, which were outstanding, though I found the sauce to be a bit on the rich side.  For dessert we shared a nightly special chocolate souffle.  It was amazing.  It was well accompanied by a very nice cup of cappuccino.  The service was top-notch, attentive, and timely.  Overall, a very good experience worth the money.",

    "text": "Simply put- this is one of the best steakhouses in the United States. We started with the chopped salad and Tuna ceviche.  The ceviche was a little plain for my taste, but quality was excellent.  The chopped salad was great when you had a little avocado in the bite. Make sure you find it because it's on the bottom of the tower. My girlfriend had a filet that sliced like butter, and had amazing flavor. I had the ribeye, and it was incredible as well. Compared to another high end steakhouse like say mastros, these steaks were on an even higher level. For sides we did a cream spinach and a mashed potato, both were very good. Every single employee from the water boy to the management was beyond nice. We had several waiters helping take care of our table for two. I would recommend this place to anyone. The views were beautiful as well. I would recommend SW in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "Two stars for the filet mignon, which lived up to expectations and its high price point, but sadly I was disenchanted with almost everything else at SW Steakhouse...  The steak comes with three sauces (SW signature sauce aka bbq, Bearnaise and jalapeno fruit) and their just seemed to be something off with all of them, though the Bearnaise seemed to be the best of the bunch. Appetizer-wise, we had the foie gras torchon. Maybe I'm so used to having foie gras that's been seared, but I thought this preparation (poached) did not offer much flavor. And the sweet accompaniments (white chocolate biscuits, and golden raisins and cherries that tasted too boozey) did not help.  And of course, since steakhouses are now all a la carte, the sides were extra....As in $10 each extra, though they were enough for two people to share (if one person has a smallish appetite). The au gratin potatoes were fine, nothing special.  Besides the meat, the only other thing I really liked was the bread---baguette and bacon and cheese biscuits---and butter---topped with olive oil and Hawaiian volcanic salt.  I was surprised that this place was pretty packed on a Tuesday night. We may be in a recession, but apparently that hasn't quite caught up with the expense accounts of all the invading conventioners.",

    "text": "Went to SW when visiting vegas for my boyfriends' birthday last weekend. The restaurant looked amazing when we came in and had beautiful views. I was very hopeful considering the reviews I had read online... We ordered Caesar salad and the shrimp cocktail to start. The shrimp was large and de-veined perfectly. Our Cesar was great as well and came out with a Parmesan crisp. We were very happy with our starters. Then the main course came out. My boyfriend had the filet and it was great! Good flavor and cut like butter. The char was not thick either. It was perfect. Then we ordered the au gratin potatoes and a Mac and cheese with poblanos and bacon. The au gratin potatoes were tasty and so was the Mac and cheese, although a little cold. THEN came my NY steak and lobster tail... The steak was slathered in so much butter that I thought I was eating a bowl of popcorn. The lobster had so much garlic I could choke. Took two bites of my steak. Took 2 of the lobster. Waitress never asked how my meal was after it was delivered. I was shocked they never asked us to cut open our steaks after they were delivered either. Only crumbed out table 1x as well. Very shocked at the service or lack thereof I should add. For 500 dollar meal for 2, you would expect more service training for the staff and cooks that don't over flavor food so horribly. Thought I was at a Paula Deen restaurant with all the butter flowing like a river. Will not be back to SW to spend my money in vegas.",

The lower rating is because our service this night was really poor.  Waitress came up and just asked if we were ready with no real introduction or tips about the menu. We had to ask her. During dinner she disappeared for a long time and we never really met her replacement. We had to pour all our own wine and rarely got our water filled and they were slow to clear items from the table. We did complain nicely about this at the end and the manager removed the gravity and side dishes from our bill so they were classy about it but I would expect better service for the prices we were paying",

We ordered the crab legs and foie gras for appetizers and they were scrumptious.  If it wasn't a 5 star restaurant, I would have licked my plate in front of everyone!  The bread also melted in your mouth.  They had these cheddar and bacon biscuits that were out of this world!  The pretzel ones are also fantastic.  The bone in Rib Eye is buttery and delicious.  The veal was probably the most flavorful veal I have head - it is extremely well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The scallops are average, but every thing else was so phenomenal.  Also, do yourself a favor and get the chocolate souffle.  We have a fantastic experience from beginning to end and HIGHLY recommend checking this place out!",

    "text": "My husband selected SW based on the most discerning of evaluation processes..he saw Dwayne Wade come out of SW on a previous trip while we were at Parasol Down. Yes folks, that is why we dined there.   The space is very nice and finds a nice balance between trendy and classy, erring on the side of classy. (This is the Wynn afterall). The waitstaff was top notch and dealt with our rather loud party with grace, although I'm sure they have seen much worse. We were just loud.   The wine list left much to be desired so I selected a martini- pear lychee- that was actually quite good. I'm normally not a fan of sweet drinks but this had a real pear sweetness to it and not an artificial flavor. We started with oysters, 2 types, which 2 of our friends loved. My husband thought they were very good, but not the best (reserved for NOLA Gulf oysters).   For my entree I selected the scallops, which were some of the best, if not the best, that I've had since moving out west. One of my friends and I switched entrees halfway through so I could sample the seared tuna, which I found to be incredibly mediocre. The serving size was large but the lack of flavor detracted from the dish. My husband selected the filet mignon, which he said was just mediocre, only because it was a little overcooked. He had asked for medium and thought it was closer to medium-well, there wasn't much pink in the middle - since a filet is a fat piece of steak, medium usually means slightly charred on the outside but still pink in the middle (as opposed to medium rare which is slightly charred on the outside and very pink on the inside, or rare which is charred on the outside and red on the inside).   In the end the bill for a party of 7 came to about $500 which I think is more than reasonable for the caliber of steakhouse that SW is. I would return to SW and I'm sure I will recommend it to friends.",

The Chili Rubbed Rib Eye was on that list.  The view was amazing, There is a beautiful outdoor scenic view, which includes a breathtaking water fall. The view alone is  worth a visit to the SW Steakhouse. Ordered the Chili Rubbed Rib Eye for two, Cream of Spinach, Potatoes Au Gratin  and Steamed Asparagus.  Let me start with the sides: I have yet to find many places that serve the perfect Au Gratin, sometimes it is either undercooked, over cheesy or both. There is nothing worse than a undercooked potatoes. That was not the case with these  Potatoes.  They were cooked perfectly, tender like a good au gratin should be. The amount of cheese/cream was just balanced enough that you could still taste the potatoes. Truly one of the best Potatoes Au Gratins I have had. The cream of spinach was outstanding, did not have an overpowering garlic taste, simple and creamy.  The Chili Rubbed Rib Eye was incredible.  It melted in your mouth, very tender and perfect amount of yummy Rib Eye Fat,,. The flavors of the Chili Rub is a very unique twist on the traditional Rib Eye for Two.  Will be back next time in Vegas!",

That left us with exactly 95 minutes to sit, order, sort through the screwups and pack out of there. It didn't happen.  On a good note...our somalier took some requests from us to find a wine suitable to our likes. It sure seemed easier than sorting through their 12 billion listings.

    "text": "I rarely give a place four stars if I don't plan to return there. SW Steakhouse will be an exception to that rule. Although my husband and I aren't huge steakhouse people, which is especially True when we go to Vegas and want to try something really different or exotic, and therefore probably won't go back to SW Steakhouse, we enjoyed our experience there this past visit and thought that the service and food were really good.   We went with the group of 7 that Kristin S and Melissa H were also part of. I agree with Kristin that the restaurant's atmosphere is really nice--upscale without being over-the-top (a balance that is hard to strike in Vegas, I think). The bathrooms (located behind the bar) were also really sleek. I also agree with both of them that the service was attentive and professional. My meal flowed very nicely, and we were never short of refills on our water or alcoholic beverages.   Speaking of drinks, my husband and I really enjoyed our dirty vodka martinis and thought they were really well-mixed. I also thought that my friend's ginger pear martini was really smooth and had great fruit flavor without being saccharin. I can't comment on the wine or beer selection since I didn't have (or think about having) either.   In terms of food, we started off with a dozen oysters. Admittedly, I have not had the privilege or pleasure of tasting the best oysters our nation has to offer (part of the sacrifice you make by living in California and then Arizona), but I have still had many oysters in my time and thought that these were among the best. Many other upscale restaurants and bars in Vegas serve oysters, but they don't seem as committed as SW obviously did to serving the freshest and most flavorful.   For entrees, I shared the scallops and ahi tuna with my friend. We found the scallops to be really well cooked (not grainy or overly tough) and super fresh (no metallic taste at all) and the accompanying pea/parmesan risotto to be hearty yet delicate, but the ahi tuna was very disappointing. It was overcooked and had a very bland taste to it; we definitely didn't taste the Meyer lemon that was supposed to be the dish's signature flavor. This alone is worth docking SW a star over, since I think ahi tuna is a dish that every restaurant worth the salt should be able to produce a good (even if standard) version of.   I also tried a bite of my friend's steak and found it be very tender and flavorful, but I'm no steak connoisseur, so if you are deciding whether the steak at SW will pass the cut (no pun intended), I would read a few other reviews. The final thing I tried was my husband's goat cheese ravioli (ordered off of the appetizer section of the menu)--while the dish was un-original, the filling was rich and the ravioli perfectly al dente. Definitely a solidly flavorful dish.   Overall, SW definitely delivered, although upon returning to Vegas (which will be soon, I'm sure), I'll probably take the $80 per person my husband and I spent at SW and spend it somewhere with a bit more focus on culinary innovation and creative execution.",

    "text": "I gotta go 5 stars here.  We came for a bachelor party and it was perfect.  The ambiance is great, they have a half indoor/outdoor seating area.  The inside opens up to open air which is covered by a canopy.  You get nice views of the small lake and waterfall fountain.  At night I believe there is a light show that comes on but we didn't stay for that.  You could also sit outside on the patio if you please.  The waiters/hostesses are all very professional.  You feel like a BOSS when you're eating here.  The wine we had was excellent, just bear in mind you're at a nice steakhouse so it's going to be expensive.  Also, make sure to make reservations far in advance, this place gets booked.  Food was delicious and portions are huge.  Some of our group got the steaks that you can share with 2 people, and they still had leftovers.  They are cool items like the double ribeye and the Porterhouse.  I went with the individual bone in rib eye.  A nice add on with the individual steaks that I didn't see come out with the larger ones was the Kobe butter.  Put that on your steak and share the love.  It's amazing.  Everything was cooked to our liking as well.  Side dishes were also good, there is the truffle creamed corn which is solid.  The mushrooms are legit.  Also, it was hard to resist trying the different breads they bring out to you, I would try them but don't get full on them.  Still, it's hard to say no to pretzel bread.  You will be happy you dined here, you get what you pay for.  I'd definitely recommend this for a nice occasion and some solid steak.",

    "text": "This is our first dining experience with the SW Steakhouse located inside Wynn Casino. The ambiance was great and it is not your average steakhouse.  But sadly to report, the food is nothing specular that demands this kind of high end pricing reserved for Fine Dining.   For appetizers,  we had the Spanish Octopus, it was so so so salty that I had to dung it in my King Crab soup which was so bland and has no seafood smell less any hint of King Crab.  It had so much minced vegetable sank to the bottom that I was mistaken it to be a vegetable soup.  Then there was the chef special, a small pasta with King Crab and mushroom.  It was just so so.  For the main dish,  we shared the Dry Aged Tomahawk chop.  The flavor was good but not intensed enough for a dry aged steak to our liking.  At least the bottle of red came through for us to save the evening.  Coffee and Lava Cake rounded out the evening.  Our server could have been more attentive.  SW has a nice setting for special occasions.  We may give it another chance in the future.  Thanks.  12/23:  We treated our daughter, who is visiting from NYC, to SW Steakhouse for her birthday dinner .  For the occasion,  the manager reserved a beautiful table looking out into the Lake of Dreams - thank you Samantha .  For appetizers,  we opted for the Spanish Octopus which was tender and tasty, the Tuna Tartare has a nice flavor and presentation,  and the Steak Tartare was excellent.   For the main course,  our server recommended the 70 day aged Hokkaido Eye Round resting on a bed of minced broccolini.  The flavor was most intensed and meat so marbled that we spent the next four hours savoring every morsel between conversations. The Hokkaido import is indeed more marbled and superior than most similary aged meat we have tried and well worth its $50 per ounce price.  SW has redeemed itself before our second round of cocktails with its world class food and great service.  Our Foie Gras finale was prepared superbly and completed our dinner round. The birthday dessert presentation was a treat, it was beautifully done and decadent.  A melting chocolate Lava domed ice cream against  the backdrop of a forest with its trees bearing fruits in the form of Beignet.  A nice hot cup of coffee rounds out the evening for the birthday girl. Thanks.",

A few lower priced wines added to the selection would be nice.   The major drawback is the ambiance, it is way too loud and too bright in the restaurant,  I felt as though we were eating at a Diner.  I much prefer the experience at John Georges at the Aria, better tomahawk chop and a more relaxing eating environment.",

I've been coming here for several years now. Every chance I have for a celebration, or treating some important guest, SW is on my list of venues to evaluate.  If you're looking for not only great food but also a superb service this is the place for you. SERVICE: Superb. There are several highly trained waiters tending to you and are barely noticeable at the same time.    FOOD: The Bone-In Rib-Eye (medium rare if I may suggest) is out of this world for the lack of a better term. My god the bread buns they bring are out of this world.  Typing this review makes me wanna drive down there.  I hereby declare it illegal to come to Vegas and not try SW! seriously",

I did share a few slices of my steak with my date, but only because I ate more of his 24oz Bone-In Rib Eye which was equally just as mouth-watering delicious! Accompanied with the Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Sauteed Veggies and Roasted Jumbo Asparagus. YUM & YUM.   The Service: ON POINT! From the time the hostess pulled my chair out and put the napkin on my lap.. to bringing out our complimentary SW chocolate covered macarons for dessert.. and everything in between - was perfect.  The Show: We were seated front row view of the Lake of Dreams. The heat lamps everywhere made it feel like a summer night in the freezing cold weather. As I took bites of my steak, I watched the dancing balls. The shows were weird.. yet funny & entertaining!  The Verdict: I'd come back here again and again for the food, but also for the giant singing frog that I somehow missed.",

This restaurant does every aspect of dining at a 5-star level:  Atmosphere:  Located on the Lake of Dreams that offers a quick \"show\" every 30 minutes, it really elevates the dining experience.  Service:  Always been top notch.  Food:  The bread, salad, appetizers, entree, sides and dessert are all amazing.  Here's my recommended order:  Bread:  Pretzel  Salad:  Half caesar  Appetizer:  I skip the appetizer to save room for the entree + sides and possibly dessert  Entree:  Pepper Crusted Chateaubriand for 2 prepared medium rare.  This obviously requires that you split the dish with another person, unless you're really hungry or an NFL linebacker.  Sides:  The Creamed Corn is an absolute must order.  I get it every single time.  After that I recommend the Yukon Gold Potato Puree.  Dessert:  I rarely have room for dessert after a meal of this caliber, so I'm not able to recommend any particular item.",

Never been to a place where the temperature of the meat is different all over. I ordered my meat rare. Some pieces were rare, medium well, well done, and overcooked meat. The meat was so tough that I didn't even finish my meal. Either the chef didn't know how to cook or he's off and they just put someone  on to make something.   We paid $130 for something that taste like shit.   Definitely, never coming back to Sw to eat. I had better steakhouse! Alexander's steakhouse in San Francisco had the best kobe beef and cook their meat properly. Also Killen's steak house in houston is awesome too.",

The decor and ambience is utter luxury and glam......just like the rest of the Wynn Hotel....very romantic.  After we ordered our Whiskies, we looked at the menu and decided to go with the Steak Tartare; 12 oz Bone-in Filet; Corn Puree and the Panna Cotta for desert.  The Steak Tartare was awesome.....full of beef flavor that was so freaking satisfying......almost as a good as a BJ.  I could have left after the appetizer and have been completely happy.  The Filet and Corn were also excellent...very tasty.  The Filet was prepared a perfect medium-rare and was sooooo good.  The Steak and Corn flavors melted very well together.  The Panna Cotta came with a Mango Sorbet ands was out of this world.  The service staff was OUTSTANDING!!!!!  We were waited on hand and foot all night.

    "text": "This review is long overdue but I didn't want to leave SW out of my Vegas chronicles, since our meal there was one of the best parts of my friend's bachelorette weekend earlier this month.   Our server, Juan, and the other gentleman who worked our table that night went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience. We were seated at a large round table right on the patio, providing awesome views for the water shows. No water glass went unfilled, and our (excellently made) drinks were promptly delivered to keep the happy buzz going through the night.   It should be noted that the bread basket at SW is insane. Cheddar bacon biscuits tasted more like mini breakfast sandwiches. Unreal.    Everyone ordered a starter although in hindsight we probably could have split them or shared a bunch because they were huge. But hey, it was our big night out and we were ready to treat ourselves. My crab salad (a special) was really delicious, but my friend's baby iceberg salad looked equally awesome.   Mostly everyone ordered steaks for their main courses which was obviously a good idea considering the place. My knife sliced through a medium rare filet like butter. Bernaise and peppercorn sauces added nice flavor but weren't entirely necessary, either. Sides of creamed spinach, au gratin potatoes, lobster mac and cheese and fingerlings with bacon were portioned to share. All were very rich so a dollop from each ramekin was perfect between the seven of us.   Desserts including one particularly delicious banana offering, along with a tree of individual-sized funnel cakes with chocolate and creme anglaise dipping sauces were divine. Everyone was full, everyone was happy and every penny was well spent. I will absolutely dine at SW again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to come to SW Steakhouse for quite sometime now and after a failed attempt to get a reservation back in April, I was determined to get one the next Vegas round.   We arrived a little past our reservation but we were promptly seated in the outdoor seating area next to the waterfall, which I might add was very beautiful and totally complimented the dining experience. They put on little shows for you as soon as the sun sets, they also have lights reflecting onto the water that change in color. So pretty! =)  APPETIZER SAUTEED FOIE GRAS w/ Grilled Pineapple, Brioche Toast and Blackberry Jam- Oh what a dish this was, the foie gras was perfectly seared (not burned, like the last foie gras I had). The pineapple added a nice contrast to the foie gras, at first I wasn't too sure it'd be a good combination BUT it was. Also the blackberry jam complimented the foie gras very well.  I'M GOING TO NEED MORE WATER 42OZ CHILI RUBBED DOUBLE RIBEYE- Like Cherylynn N. mentioned, this dish was featured on Food Networks \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" so we had fairly high hopes for this dish. SO DISAPPOINTING,  the chili rub was way too overpowering, too salty, too much seasoning, IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH and too much of something can't always be good.  I found myself having to drink a couple of glasses of water because the rub was too overbearing and took away from the steaks flavor! I'm shocked that this would be on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" because this didn't come anywhere close to being the best thing I ever ate. Oh, might I add that our steak was OVERCOOKED!!  SIDELINERS BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED CORN, PARMESAN CREAMED SPINACH, MAC 'N CHEESE, FINGERLING POTATOES w/ Green Beans & Bacon- Our of all the sides, I thought the mac n' cheese was the best. Why? Because I like mac n' cheese, that good enough for ya? =X   THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT FUNNEL CAKE & STRAWBERRIES w/ Anglaise, Salty Caramel and Fudge Sauce- THANK GOD FOR DESSERTS! This was the best out of all the dishes we had. The funnel cake was soft and warm and when dipped in any of the 3 dipping sauces was like taking a bite of heaven.   HI, YES WE'RE STILL HERE! (SERVICE) So, our waitress was MIA more than half the time. I don't remember her checking on us at all but I watched her multiple times go to tables where older customers were seated and checked up on them. The only times we saw her was when we placed our orders, when our friend had to complain about his steak because it was WAY OVERCOOKED and when she handed us the bill. A restaurant in the Wynn lacks service in their restaurants, I'm shocked.   OVERCOOKED Ah, now you must be wondering about the overcooked steak. If not, YOU BETTER START TO WONDER!! =X jk. All joking aside, our friend had to send his steak back because his steak was cooked well-done instead of medium-rare. How in God's name does a steakhouse overcook a steak? How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!   Our waitress then asked our party if everyone's steak was cooked to their liking but she said it in a tone, a tone like \"UGH F%^&, ANYONE ELSE??\" *flips the bird* WHATEVER LADY.  CONCLUSION Never coming back here, I'm so disappointed. The restaurant is a beautiful one but beauty can't mask what's truly inside and what's truly inside, an MIA waitress and overcooked steaks. The foie gras, dessert and enchanting waterfall could not save this review from being 2 stars because I didn't come here for either one of those things. I came here for a good steak and that's NOT what I got, all I got was a bag full of disappointment.",

It was a thoroughly perfect dining adventure.  The wait staff was amazing and so attentive every minute.  I dined on a shrimp cocktail for my appetizer and had the scallops with risotto for the main course. I had been warned to save room for dessert and am so happy that I did.

So we essentially has 3 people assigned to our table (it's been a week but I think there names are right) first Chris asked us about  drinks and got us started,  then Ken  (actually not sure about this one) asked us if he could help us with the menu and took our order.  Then Cesar was our table clearer water pourer. They are extremely attentive and eager to help make your meal wonderful. Unfortunately I am dairy free and they made sure that my meal remained such.  The \"show\" during dinner included a giant singing frog and flowers but was enjoyable.  Decor is warm. Food fantastic.  One minor complaint or annoyance for me on the menu there is an all natural filet.  Now if your into healthy eating you know all natural is bunch of nonsense all natural means mamy different things lots of then not actually being anything natural.  So when I asked what there all natural meant I was told organic.  I hope that was True because that is what I ordered so to the chef you may want to make that clear if it is indeed organic. Would I Return yes!",

I ordered the vegan meatballs with polenta (my stomach was hurting and needed something lighter than steak), tasted like real meat but again, way too salty. Sides of mac n cheese and potato gratin, I was told these were also salty. Get the theme here? Or maybe that's how Americans eat - with tons of salt on everything?  The bread they start you off with are really good though! Especially those bacon bits biscuits. Sloooooooooooooooo service. If you ain't paying the big bucks, you are getting served last, for everything (water, food, bill, etc).  Very nice view of the waterfall area they had.   It's not my cup o' tea and will not go back.",

Service is top notch, drinks, decor and the food are all what you would expect from the only five-star, five Michelin restaurant in Vegas.   We started with the grilled shrimp...perfectly succulent, tender blackened shrimp served with a light, citrusy cucumber salad.   Next the 30 oz tomahawk steak was presented bone in and took. Me. Second to not wanna scream abba dabba doo, but was so tender and juicy. This is their most expensive steak coming with an $104 price tag, but since most of their steaks come in at around $50-$60, it's actually economical and delish!   The garlic broccolini was perfectly sauteed and swimming in garlic goodness.   Get their anytime after 730 to enjoy the show on the lake, and reveal I'm the romance and sin of sin city",

I have no qualms with paying exorbitant prices for outstanding food. I have a slight problem paying exorbitant prices for marginal food. This is marginal food.  The steaks were about as good as you can find at any other steakhouse. Some of the sides, appetizers and salads were above average. I think when you're spending $100+ per plate on dinner, it ought to be off the hook good. Not so at SW Steakhouse.  Slightly upturned face.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed.   My husband and I have been coming here every time we come to Vegas (about once a year) for at least the last 6 years. My husband made reservations for us to go last night and we were so excited for our anniversary date.   For starters the ambiance is beautiful. We sat outside which is our favorite place to sit because of the beautiful setting.  Our server: the reason we were so disappointed with our experience. He started the evening well, but the second we received our food he disappeared for over 45 minutes! No one checked on our food or asked us if my husband wanted a 3rd cocktail or me a 2nd glass of wine. Nope, instead we sat there with no additional drinks and by the time he did roll around he asked us if we wanted dessert and we were just over it.  Food: a couple things went wrong that don't usually last night. My husbands medium steak was cooked well done. Of course we were never checked on for this to be corrected. The au gratin potatoes we ordered were so strange. So salty and all cream (we literally had one small bite and left the rest). Since our waiter never checked on us, another server ended up coming and cleaning our table off (not even asking how things were or why we left our au gratin untouched or my husbands steak half eaten).   When you go to a restaurant of this caliber, you expect a certain level of service which gives you a good experience and honestly, we have been to restaurants before that have food issues (it happens) that were promptly corrected and we walked away with a smile on our face. But when your server doesn't even care to ask you how your meal is and you are stuck eating a rubberized steak and can't have more alcohol and can't eat the potatoes you were dreaming about for the last year you walk away quite disappointed.  I don't know if we will go back on our next trip. We might have to break our tradition and find a new home that appreciates its patrons a bit more.",

I didn't know the type of place we were going so was not compliant with their dress code.  It was 110 degrees outside and I was in shorts.  When I was not allowed to sit with the rest of my party, I went back to my room at another hotel and changed.  I get places having dress codes but we were sitting outside and I have no idea why it was so strict.  The girl who \"talked\" to me was rude and condescending.  I'm sure if I looked like I had a bunch of money, she would have let me be seated with the rest of my group.   That being said, when I got back after changing, we ordered and the food was amazing.  It was one of the best cooked steaks I've had.  The \"show\" entertainment out in the pond was interesting.  I'm pretty sure I saw a red giant ball and a blue giant ball have sex and produce a little purple ball.  I have no idea who comes up with this stuff but we were laughing a lot at the shows every thirty minutes or so.  So for food, 5 stars.  Service 1 or 2.  Gets me to this average.",

My scallops were amazing..pretty much everything was to die for. Our mac and cheese was pretty bland, but i'll forgive them. We ordered cosmopolitians and wine, what a great selection.

None of the shows are that great, but it breaks up the meal, it's a great setting, and the meal was amazing.  I took my (now) wife there for her birthday, and I arranged for their pastry chef to make a cake for her.  Apparently, their pastry chef won some national cake-making competition.  The one she made for us looked like a present with a bow on it!  Pretty amazing stuff.    Steaks and the service were very good, but the outdoor setting is what sets this apart.",

The ribeye was great.  It was no different than any other $60 prime ribeye.  the steak was not caked in butter and seasoning.  it was quite tender and had good marbling and very juicy.  the mac & cheese was a huge portion and very good.  for dessert i have no idea what i ordered but it tasted good.  dinner for 1 adult before tip was $115.  i would definitely go back!!",

    "text": "95 degrees in the SHADE, w/a no shorts policy AND we still dined alfresco.  We're troopers.  And YES, it was sweltering, surprisingly, there were at least 10 other parties on the terrace.  We must run HOT.    The servers were also visibly uncomfortable, seeing as they were fully dressed: buttoned up to the neck, vests, slacks AND even the ladies had to sport a tie.    We lasted through the bread, salad course, and half a glass of wine.  Our server was oh so gracious when we took up her offer to be moved inside.    We were whisked away into the dining room w/o hesitation and seated at one of the tables lining the perimeter.  I must complain about the seating: bench on one side & a plush chair sans armrests.  I need my armrests!!!    Oh and if you're not good at your INDOOR voice, like me, the guests around you will be listening in on your conversation.  I hate that.  Is everyone THAT bored with their conversation that they have to listen to ours?!?!    Dining room was basic.  I really enjoyed the dining by the faux lake.  They have misters, but they are not used b/c they drip on patrons.    EAT the cheese bread.  Subtle flavor with bits of bacon baked inside.  EAT the baguette too, nice and crusty.  EAT IT!!!    Salads: -Great presentation and hearty portions.   -The Caesar had a creamy tangy dressing and the anchovy was coiled on the side. -Beet salad had two types of beets, a fantastic balsamic glaze, crunchy frissee w/NO traces of dirt, and pea sprouts.    Entrees: -Wagyu steak & scallops.  It's more of a scallop dish: strips of thin steak on medium sized scallops.  Very Asian inspired.  Wasn't a fan.  I've said it before, I don't like the Orient coming b/t me and my meat!!! -10oz filet.  Yay!  Charred to the MAX.  I love cancerous char.  Wasn't the crumbly char, it was the CRISPY char.  Plus, the meat was tender and cooked with a nice cool, red center.  Beautiful.    Dessert: Summer sampler: strawberry shake, ice cream sandwiches, sorbet, & ice cream bars.  I LOVE minis!!!  Very whimsical, but TOO much.  Four people can easily share this.  It would have been nice for them to provide some sort of FREEBIE sweet treat @ the end.    Watch for the pictorial soon.",

The only con was when we first walked in the hostest was a little snooty, my friend and I were casually dressed per the weather but I definitely saw guys in suits, maybe it's because we are younger females as well.. who knows? But I asked for a table with a great view of the waterfall.   We were seated about 10 minutes after arriving with a reservation for 5:30pm-- service was amazing, I wish I could remember his name but the guy that had our table was so sweet and nice, very knowledgeable and honest about the portions. My friend and I ended up sharing everything, even a steak and we were left so full  and really satisified!   We got our steak crusted in blue cheese, had the truffle creamed corn (OMG==YUMM) and the Gnocchi with Lobster (I think it was a seasonal special). We had the little fried cakesfor dessert (can't remember what they were actually called) but everyone talks about them.. the display was cute and the sauce was delish. I would probably try something new next time though.   Anyways- we ended up sitting until 8:30pm and no rush to get us out, they actually kept bringing us drinks wanting us to stay since at 8pm they have light/water shows... beware of the really large Frog that sings songs!! But if you never saw it it's pretty hysterical.. don't say I didn't worn you!!",

I thought he would love to see the lake feature and view, I just tried to make a reservation and was told that they dont allow children younger than 5 yo, sure I can understand, PRETTY PATHETIC. I just called Mastros and they will GLADLY accept my $$. Not that SW cares.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here while guests at the Wynn. As their signature steakhouse, this place is not cheap. Expect to pay 15-20 for appetizers and 40+ for the steaks. Reservations are recommended and thy have a dress code. We ate here on a Sunday at 530, the only time other than 10 we could get. I don't know if one can request a table by the waterfall, but if there is a next time for us I will request that. The waterfall sound and effect is much more interesting than being seated in the restaurant interior. We ordered the crab cakes and jumbo shrimp cocktail appetizers. These were good, nothing exceptional. The shrimp were not very jumbo. For an entree we split the chili rubbed double rib eye. This was 42 oz and a lot of meat. The steak was very good and we liked the chili rub. It was also over $100! We ordered the truffle cream corn everyone raves about. I'd say it tastes like sweet cream corn. I tasted no truffle. Overall I give the food 4 stars. The service I give only 3 stars. We had high expectations given what I had read about this place. Our waitress was friendly but inattentive. After we received our steaks she came back once. The rest of the time she spent chit chatting with the hostess or other tables. We waited quite awhile after finishing our steaks before the table was cleared and even longer before dessert was offered. Don't get me wrong, the service was not egregiously bad, and the other staff did pick up some of the slack where she failed.  But it tarnished our dining experience and when you are spending that kind of money you expect better service.",

As many other yelpers have said before, we felt that because we were on the younger side our waitor  treated us as if we were non-existent. All the older patrons around us were getting checked on constantly and we were left with bare bones service. The servers pouring water were really the only ones paying attention to us. When you know you are going to be spending +$100/person I think you can expect great service and this wasn't even close to that.   The food was good, especially the beef carpaccio appetizer. It was so delicious and a perfect way to start the meal out. The steak was overcooked ughh -  we might have tried to discuss it with the waiter if we could just find him. My scallop entree was wonderful and the sauce was perfect.   As many others have said ask to sit on the patio by the \"lake\" with the show that goes on every 30 mins. We requested this and were told we would be out there on the phone, then we were shoved in the far back corner of the dining room. That was just another annoying thing that happened, but we didn't want to make a big deal about it. Now looking back, after the service was so bad I wish I would have. At least then we could have enjoyed the show!",

We asked the sommelier for a recommendation for a red wine between $80 and $100.  He didn't give us a look on the price point, stayed within it and recommended a GREAT bottle of wine. We started with the foie gras - which was amazing and a BIG piece.  Hubby got the filet, I just ordered the wedge salad and told them I would have some of husband's steak and lobster mac and cheese.  Again, no look, just great service.  Took our time before the La Reve show, got to see a few incarnations of the outside show, had a great time and a great meal.

At the last minute she suggested SW at Wynn because she wanted it \"to be something special\". Now in retrospect, going to a steakhouse owned by someone who calls himself a \"vegan\" is like trying to buy an assault rifle from Ghandi and I wish I had known. My girlfriend ordered the crab soup for starters, hated it and did not finish it. The rib eye was just OK with a very small \"collar\", the fatty part that makes it takes good. But the part that stands out was that the waiter NEVER ONCE came back after we got our order to check on us. Just not acceptable in this price range. I may be coming back to Wynn but definitely not to SW Steakhouse.",

I doubt it's that crowded every night but I don't think I would chance it.    The food was fantastic.  Everyone was very pleased with their dish.  I had the prime rib. My mother had the veal.  My father and brother-in-law had the T-bone steak and shrimp, my sister had the scallops and my niece had the chicken breast.  Everything melted in our mouths.  The bread was excellent.  The sides are served family style.  The mashed potatoes were wonderful however the lobster mac and cheese was just OK.  It was seasoned well but I would have preferred more bits of lobster.    We had a table right in the window.  It was too cold to sit outside.  Weh ad a perfect view of the Lake of Dreams water show.  I know everyone loves this show but I was totally not into it.  We only saw 3 of the many shows they do...the creepy frog that sang 'What a Wonderful World', the ginormous flowers dancing with each other and the colored orbs that danced on the water.  Personally I didn't get the purpose of the shows AT ALL.  I think the shows must to have been designed by someone who was on psychadelic drugs.  I would have preferred to just have a view of the beautiful waterfall.  I honestly didn't need to see a gigantic creepy looking frog singing.  But like I said, I know I'm the minoritiy in this opinion because everyone else I know RAVES about this water show.  I don't get it.  But otherwise that, I totally loved the restaurant and would go back again.    By the way, they claim to have a somewhat strict dress code where men have to wear collared shirts and no jeans allowed and whatnot, but we saw quite a few people come in that night wearing shirts with no collars AND jeans.",

SW certainly deserves all the accolades it receives, but you won't find a server in the place that takes this for granted.  I guess I can start there... the service.  We were so busy lauding and gushing over our food, that I actually began to sense that we were keeping our server from our other tables, but you would have never known.  Both times I've visited SW, the service was of the highest caliber.  Absolutely top notch in terms of professionalism and knowledge.  I don't even know where to begin with the food.  I supposed I'll list the dishes I had on both occasions, but frankly, this place outdoes just about any restaurant I've visited.  Oysters... the best I've ever had... ever.  Amous bouche, perfect and savory.  The steak... ohhh, the steak.  Magnificent.  I am not the type to order a steak everywhere it's served.  I would opt for pork or seafood at a nice place, because I'm particular about my beef.  I get the sense that you can pay upwards of $50 for an average steak, while delicious seafood and \"other white meat\" dishes go unnoticed.  This wasn't one of those occasions.  Easily, easily the best steak I've ever had.  Name a Chicago \"chop house\" and I've dined there... this tops them all.  Deserts were fantastic, and the wine... the wine was incredible.  I had 3 or 4 of the best red wines I've ever had at SW.  We had a Pinot Noir, a Cab and a Syrah (or petit Syrah, can't recall), that were world class.  Absolutely special to taste.  Bottom line?  SW is something special.  An absolute can't miss.  The most worthy 5 star review I've ever given.",

We did have to wait an extra 20 minutes for our reservation and hostess didn't even apologize - however it was delicious.    The food was incredible, steak - cooked perfectly.  I had creamed truffle corn?  Um, why doesn't everywhere have this?  The asparagus - more truffle but I am sucker for anything with truffle salt, oil, shavings you name it - put them on a shoe and I am in heaven, so maybe my opinion is biased.  The tomato and mozzarella salad was perfect.    I am allergic to gluten and when I asked for a bread alternative they brought out lentil rice crackers!  Talk about service and going the extra mile :) The server was fantastic and hats off to the chef.    I ordered wine but everyone else loved their drink.  So thank you wine buyer, servers and bartenders.  The dessert - decadent.  But the price? Omg it better be great!  I have never seen a more expensive wine list.  They should have a couple reasonable wines - there isn't one.",

The porterhouse was good, but what really got me was the actual Japanese KOBE beef. omg...amazing.... yummy If you come here, be prepared to shell out at least $100 bucks/person. it's worth it though",

Our party of ten people split appetizers which allowed us to share asparagus, creamed corn, Mac and cheese, and other tasty treats. We inhaled all of our cheddar bacon biscuits- yum!  I did not order a steak for dinner (I know,   I know, it's a STEAKHOUSE) but wanted something a tad lighter so I ordered the seared scallops on a bed of risotto. It was perfect.  One note: the waterfall show during dinner is FREAKY-- it would be best enjoyed while tripping on acid. It's a strange interruption to the flow of the dinner conversation and it takes away from the classy atmosphere.  Overall, it was a lovely dinner, but didn't stand out enough that I would come back on my next trip.",

The stairs leading down to SW was an awesome sight of the Lake of Dreams. Reservations are a must. You need to book at least 2 weeks in advance and request if you want to sit outside. We were seated by the glass doors and under the large heater lamps. They advised us that the winds might pick up, just in case we wanted to sit inside. We went for the winds. The presentation of everyone and how they served you were phenomenal. The frog show or big colored lights floating and moving around was very relaxing. Expect to be there for 2 hours. The ambiance, decor and being around the Lake of Dreams was completely relaxing and totally enjoyable. It's high end dining so expect to break the bank. We ordered the Seafood Spectacular, NY Strip, Filet Mignon, sauteed vegetable, Yukon gold potato puree & sparkling water & cocktails. We love the free bread, very tasty, it's a meal itself, guess we ate too much of that. The steaks were huge. It was so much food & rich that we couldn't even get dessert in. My son was literally busting out of his shirt that he had to hunch over! LOL They also have lovely containers and a beautiful bag which looks like you went shopping when I asked for a doggie bag. High end doggie bag is nothing to be afraid of. I would recommend this place to everyone for high end dining.",

They should of either told me that when making reservation or called and told me because that was one reason I went there. They also don't do anything for birthdays which is bad for such a fancy restaurant, espically when your paying alot for dinner. Least they could do is buy you a 15 dollar dessert.",

First thought was the cool evening but the heaters did the trick and when the goodies started to roll, all was perfect.  Started with Caesar salads, right amout of lettuce to match the dressing and had a New York steak for entree.  Others had Filet's large and small with the Au Gratin potatoes. Had a couple of other sides but the creamed corn was not to our liking even though it was a hit by our waiters standards but reminded me of oatmeal.

But I will give you a review of what we had this time.  The majority of our party got the double chile rubbed rib eye.  I gotta say this was an excellent dish.  Nice chile flavor and the meat was very tender.  One thing the waiter told us was that you can pretty much order the chile rub with any steak on the menu.  A little inside tip for y'all.  This time the wife and I split a tomahawk steak.  It looked awesome when it came to our table and it was very good.  But, I don't know that it was any different than a regular bone in rib eye.    We got morel mushrooms, creamed spinach, and truffled corn for sides.  The sides were tasty especially the truffled corn.  But I had a big problem with the size of the sides.  They cost $18 each and were very small portions.    My original review stands.  Very elegant first class restaurant but the food, for the price, is average.",

So delicious! Melts in your mouth. We all ordered steaks and one had the scallops. Our sides were the Maine Lobster mac and cheese, and the Black Truffle Creamed Corn. I couldn't believe how these two sides can be sooooooo yummy and complimented our meal. I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye which melted in my mouth! Seriously cooked perfectly. and i also tried the Pan Roasted Sea Scallops and WOW this was soooo good. It was grilled nicely and went well with the risotto and the black truffle sauce.

    "text": "This has to be one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. Was staying at the Encore for a business trip and on my last night in town I decided that I needed a steak. Thankfully I didn't need to leave the property to find one.  Since I was traveling alone I was glad to see that they had a bar that offered three full menu. Sat down and was greeted by very friendly bartenders. I found out that they only recently (month or two) started to carry any kind of craft beer. On their suggestion I tried a beer from what they raids was thee oldest continuously operating brewery in the world. This was the first time I've ever been served a beer in a huge, red wine-sized glass.  The bread basket was a pleasant surprise. Definitely the king here are their bacon-cheddar rolls. I could have easily filled up on these alone.  Main course was their ribeye steak and a side of creamed corn. I ordered my steak medium-rare and they nailed it. Thee crust on the steak brought a ton of flavor and did not overcook it in the least bit. I read that they offer several house-made sauces for their steaks, but believe me when I say you won't need them.  The creamed corn was only OK though. Great flavors and not too sweet. My issue with them is that the corn was pretty much pureed and had the texture and constancy of baby food. I much prefer the creamed corn at Lawry's over this.  I would have given them 5 stars except for two things: the corn and the location/atmosphere. This place can get LOUD. It is located right on the hotel's water feature, which goes off about every half-hour. This show, while interesting, blasts its music directly into the restaurant.",

It was an amazing dinner, great service, atmosphere and food.  I recommend reserving a table outside if the weather is nice because eating on the lake with the waterfall shows going on every 30 minutes is so much fun.  We ordered a delicious bottle of Pinot Noir (Cristom) So smooth! And the vegan vegetarian menu was delicious. I had: Beet Salad and Tofu Steak. Wonderful. Tofu steak was nice and crispy on the outside and a great (not to soft and silky) texture on the inside. Topped with great sauce and fresh herbs. Husband had: Chopped Salad and Veggie Risotto. He loved both!  And dont forget the sides! Special side of the day was black beans with jalapeno and goat cheese, grilled asparagus with lemon, roasted broccoli with shallots and delicious fresh cut french fries. (Ask for the vegetarian sauces to dip! Tropical jalapeno and spicy bbq!)  The dessert menu ALL looked so good and I know we will have to come back to taste more of it. We decided on the funnel cake which came with fresh juicy strawberries and chocolate, white chocolate and salty caramel dipping sauce. Its huge. Good to share for 4 or more people! I think you get 5 or 6 small funnel cakes!  It was a perfect romantic night :)",

    "text": "Went there last weekend with 7 friends. Aside from occasional solo trips, we do a yearly buddy LV trip and try to experience new places every time. This trip we decided on the SW at the Wynn, where we were staying. In case you are short on time, let me start with the conclusion: You get much better meat and service at other places in Vegas (STK or Gordon Ramsay's place) and at better or same prices. Skip it.   In detail: we booked a week before, which granted is not a lot of time, so we thought ourselves lucky to get a table. When we arrived with the host they asked us to wait and see if they could sit us in the terrace (nice views of the fountain). After 30 minutes they said they could not so they sat us behind a big column with no views. No big deal since they do not guarantee terrace tables, but kind of annoying to have us wait for nothing. When we sat down the real SW experience began. 8 thirsty and hungry guys sit at your restaurant. What do you do? How about ignore them for the first 15 minutes. Nothing. No wait staff. No 'welcome to our place'. No 'what would you like to drink'. I felt like at a cheap chain where they keep cutting staff to try to stay alive. I finally got up to find a waiter. I had to do this 3 times during the meal. Our glasses were never refilled. they would not clear our dinner plates until we went and told them to do it and getting them to offer us coffee and dessert was like pulling teeth. We consumed a hefty amount, with the bill well over $1,000, yet they treated us like if the cat had dragged us in the back door.   Sometimes you are willing to take really bad service in exchange for a a great meal. This was not one of those times. The meat was a definite blah. Nothing special. The sides were also just ok. Really nothing memorable. At one point I got up and spoke to a bald guy that said he was 'one of the managers'. he listened to me, went back to the kitchen and...never came back! it was hilarious. He just disappeared and the service did not improve. When we left we did not even get a 'thank you for coming' from the hosts at the front. Note that we were neither drunk nor obnoxious. Just wanted to have a good dinner. From what I hear Mr. Wynn cares about his guests having a good time. It is too bad that the staff at his namesake restaurant at his namesake hotel do not have the same attitude. Not going back.   Btw, speaking of obnoxious, the wine list here was very much so. very few wines under $100 and most over $200-$300. And it was not that the quality was so great, just the prices are hyperinflated, I guess to match the bad service.   I think this place survives on one-time suckers (like us) that go for the name and the place, but I cannot see many patrons returning. Many much better options around.",

I chose Mushroom risotto as I am not much of  steak fan, but enjoyed several bites of his. We opted for the au gratin as our side, ok choice. The dessert we chose was the funnel cakes , at $18, we were not sure what to expect, but beautiful presentation and delicious!!

    "text": "I really, really, REALLY wanted to like SW Steakhouse. But the service was abysmal and sadly the food, albeit very good, didn't make up for it. I walked out of SW Steakhouse very, very disappointed.    My fiance and I were getting married soon after the visit, and when I called to make my reservation, I informed the hostess of this and she assured me we'd get a nice table outside near the waterfall. When we arrived, the hostess led us to a table, and with an outstretched hand gestured us to the table located in the back corner of the restaurant. Wait, what?   When I asked why we weren't getting the table we were promised, she briefly spoke with another host and simply answered: \"the wait for a table outside will be a half hour.\" She answered a question I didn't even ask.   On any normal day, we would have left and found another restaurant (hell, there's more in Las Vegas than any one person could visit in an entire month). However, we took the table because we did not have enough time to find another restaurant on a busy Saturday night with an hour and half until our show.   The waiter did not arrive to greet us until 10 or so minutes after we were seated. To summarize our server: he was mostly brief, aloof and completely indifferent. He did not share with us any information about the food, chef specials, or his favorite items on the menu. He simply came to 'take orders', so to speak, and would then leave. His demeanor didn't perk up until we ordered $200 in food and drinks. When I told him of my allergies, he was thankful and assured me that the kitchen would be well aware and our food would not contain any allergens. The food held True to his word.   Honestly, I felt a bit profiled by our server. My fiance and I are somewhat affluent mid-twenty somethings that dressed for the occasion, but we didn't look like the average Wynn guest: mid 40s to 50s and obviously very wealthy. And we likely weren't treated like them, either.  When told we were time-bound, our server made note of it when taking our order. Our food arrived promptly and gave us plenty of time to enjoy it. It's one of the few kudos: they made timing a priority and delivered.   With 20 minutes until our show began, and with our server nowhere in sight, I had to flag down what looked like a manager to give us our bill and he transacted our payment. We may have seen our server once or twice throughout the meal.   The only thing that saved SW Steakhouse from a 1 star review would be the food. The porterhouse was exquisitely cooked and delicious; it will not be soon forgotten. But like most high end steakhouses, exquisite food is to be expected, so I won't bother detailing it. The food is very good, I can assure you of that.   We will not be returning to SW Steakhouse.",

    "text": "I have never written a bad review before I had to write one about this restaurant.  My husband and I have eaten at many of the steakhouses on the strip (Gordon Ramsay, STK, The Steakhouse, Prime, etc.) and are accustomed to the prices and atmosphere of these restaurants.  First off let me say that there is a brand new valet policy whereby you are charged $13 to utilize valet parking along by with a tip.  Since this is such a new policy the valet told us to ask SW to validate our parking since our meal would be well over $100 and \"they should validate your parking\".  That is where the problem started and it didn't get much better from there.  We were seated in the middle of the restaurant which made us feel as though we were in a huge fish bowl.  Also, there are about 10 people too many working there.  It appeared as though there were 3 managers on the floor and about 7-8 too many waitstaff all just standing around.  I am all for having enough people there to be highly attentive to guests but this was overkill and also made you feel as though you were being watched throughout your entire dinner.  Then, as we were seated we asked the hostess about the validation for valet parking.  She looked at us as though we had asked her to comp our meal.  The appalled look on her face and tone in her voice made us feel embarrassed for asking (which we were told to do by the valet guy himself).  Wish we would have never asked.  We were mortified--not how you want your guests to feel.  Valet and the hostess clearly need more training.  Valet needs to know correct info. before telling guests something and a hostess needs to know how to disguise her disgust better!  Now, for the food.  We are not alcohol drinkers so when our waitress came to take our drink orders and we told her we don't drink alcohol again there was an annoyed/appalled look on her face.  My husband had the ribeye steak and Parmesan French fries, and neither were good.  His steak was tough and burned on the outside making it almost inedible. The fries looked like they were three day old Ore Ida steak fries that had been re-heated and rolled in Parmesan cheese.  I ordered the NY Strip and fennel mac n cheese. My steak was great but the mac n cheese was terrible.  It was so grainy, it too was inedible.  Very disappointing meal and could not wait to leave the restaurant!",

I had been a vegetarian almost my whole life and within the last year have started eating meat I had my first steak at Morton's in Costa Mesa and have never looked back.  Getting a reservation was fairly easy as I was already staying at the Wynn.  The restaurant is completely empty yet outside seating is reserved no one ever arrives to sit out there during my whole meal.  The steak came out cold i wanted medium rare but not cold.  The attitude the waiter displayed was very unprofessional if you don't want complaints don't serve me a cold $70 dollar filet.  I was trying to get a nice buzz going on if someone would have came back to my table more than twice i could have have drank more than one $25 dollar martini.  Going back to the Wynn this week for my brothers bday but we'll be finding another Steakhouse inside another hotel I'm sure I can find one where the service matches the price and ambience.",

    "text": "With all of the highly rated steakhouses in Las Vegas, I am disappointed that we chose to dine at this one. The service was decent, but that is to be expected when you have three servers circling your table at all times. The wine selection leaves a lot to be desired in selection and price range. They have non-estate California wines on the menu for $40/glass and up; yet, the same wines are available in the hotel bar for half the price. That was off putting.   Then, the servers...they are not rude but they aren't nice either. They are just there, serving. They barely spoke and were not approachable. Overall their attitude does not match the ambiance of the restaurant. It is an open air steakhouse with outdoor seating that overlooks a water show, so there is no apparent need for the pretentiousness of the wait staff.   The food was definitely a 3 star experience. It didn't knock my socks off but it wasn't terrible. The filet mignon was dry and unseasoned. The cream corn was good but had too much cilantro in it. There was a lobster gnocchi on the menu that was to die for! The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and there was plenty of lobster in the dish. I also had the scallops, but I substituted the risotto for asparagus as the reviews on the risotto were not good. The scallops were very well cooked but severely under seasoned.   In all, I cannot say that I would recommend anyone eat at this restaurant and expect to receive the food and service associated with a 5 star steakhouse. Have a few drinks at the bar and enjoy the ambience, but plan to have dinner elsewhere.",

    "text": "Came out to Vegas with a couple buddies on a spur of the moment road trip from California.  As customary tradition, we like to do one fine dining per trip to Vegas.  Initially we had a couple restaurants in mind, but upon booking our hotel at the Wynn, we got convinced by the front desk to try SW.  Location: SW is located inside of Wynn by the Lake of Dreams which is on one of the lower floors directly across from Lakeside Seafood.  Food:  One of the main reasons why i choose this place was the fact that they served Foie Gras (which has been banned from California) and im a steak lover.  I figured if Steve Wynn was willing to put his reputation/name on the line for a restaurant than it must be good.   Complimentary bread-  One would think complimentary bread would be complimentary bread, but SW took it up a notch and not only offered a variety of bread but they also offered a bacon cheese bread which was delicious.   Seared Steak Tartare w/ worcestershire, Dijon aioli, crumbled egg, chives, and grilled bread-  To my disappointment the steak tartare was very bland and had no worcestershire or dijon aioli flavor to it.  Sauteed Hudson Valley Foie Gras-  Out of all the items i ordered, this was my favorite.  The foie gras was cooked perfectly and the sauces complimented the dish very well.  Also to me and my buddy's suprise they did not skimp out in regards to portion size.  I was very impressed with this dish and it almost made me want to order another one lol.  Bone-In Ribeye-  Due to the fact that SW is known as a steakhouse which has been endorsed by Steve Wynn, i expected the steak to be really good.  I choose the Rib eye due to the fact that it would have the most flavor because of its marbling.  Upon order i had requested my rib eye to be medium rare and told him that i would not mind if it was more on the raw side since most steak places tend to overcook.  In my opinion its always best to be undercooked than overcooked since it can be corrected.  Unfortunately for me, my steak came out overcooked and more on the well done side.  The steak lacked a little bit of flavor and was not tender as i expected it (prob because it was overcooked).  When the waiter checked up on our table and asked if everything was okay, i noted that my steak was way overcooked.  He simply replied with im sorry ill let the cook know and make sure it wont happen next time and did not offer to solve the issue nor have my steak redone (Only had two bites..initial bite and the second bite from the middle just to verify it being overcooked).  Overall i was pretty disappointed with this place.  The only thing that was really good was the foie gras and the bacon cheese bread.  For a place that is considered fine dining, one would think they would fix the problem and make sure its customer's were satisfied with their meal esp in a city where there are many competitors in the fine dining department.  As far as coming back, sandly i am still not sure if i would come back to this place.",

I was so excited to come here but after having Prime, Mastros, Carnevino, etc...the experience was a bit lackluster for me. The restaurant itself isn't overly decorated and the service was just ok. We didn't really get a view of the waterfall but occasionally we would hear the music and see some of the lights from the show.

It was seared perfectly and had the right amount of crisp. Generally, I don't like the salted crust on steaks, but SW had just enough. I mean, enough to barely even taste it.  For our sides, we ordered the black truffle cream corn 5/5; AMAZING! It's blended and very light, balancing the savory au gratin and steak. Au gratin was a smaller side in comparison to the corn 3.5/5.  We also ordered the shrimp cocktail 3.5/5, 3 plump shrimp, presented very well. However, I thought it was slightly over cooked.   SERVICE: nothing over the top. 3/5? Our waitress checked on us twice during the 1.5-2 hours we were there. We asked for the check from someone else, that person brought out a dessert menu... Later on, she did too, not knowing what was going on. When opted not to order dessert (was so full!) the waiter was over sensitive as to why we didn't want any. If I don't have room, I don't have room! you're not a sales person!   Overall, I didn't mind the service but it wasn't superb, esp comparing to the food.  Five stars because of the steak. It was amazing!  Ps,  French bread if the bread basket was crisp and very warm. :)",

When I go to a steakhouse, I always measure them by their filet mignon.  (So obviously this review excludes any kobe varieties cause that would not be a fair comparison).    What i loved about the steak here was the crispy crust, the seasoning, tenderness, and juiciness.  It was like no other.  It was mind-blowing.  And at their price-point, compared to their neighbors, like Cut etc., this is a steal!  oh, and we also had oysters, truffled cream corn, truffled asparagus, and the banana dessert, some nice wine and a fantastic water show outside, all which were great accompaniments to our steak.",

Opentable only had a 5:30 and a 9:00 (and a phone call to the number listed here on Yelp yielded similar reservation times), ultimately got a 6pm, but upon arrival, there were a lot of empty tables.  Gotta think they hold back tables expecting certain clientele, but that really shouldn't be done at the detriment of other customers (particularly the ones who save up for long times to eat at places like this).  Ordered the chili-rubbed double rib eye: Unique and well-prepared.  Certainly no dish like it in any of the nation's elite steakhouses.  My only quibble may be with how the chili rub masks the natural salty flavor secreted by the fat of such a premium cut of beef.  Chocolate Souffle for desert: Normally a nice and rich dish most times it's ordered at a place like this.  SW's version didn't seem to be all to unique though.  The souffle itself was a bit smaller than the ones you'd get a most comparable places, and didn't really stand out as much as I would've liked.  Odd company in the restaurant on this particular night, two tables away, two street-clothes dressed young men ordered nothing but a cocktail and a soda, behind us, a small group of women who apparently ordered nothing but a fruit dessert.    Glad to have crossed this one off the list.  The steak was well-prepared with a unique flavor.  But on a night where the restaurant is likely to struggle to do a respectable cover number, the reservation process should not have been as encumbering as it was.",

    "text": "We had dinner at SW last night.  Had really looked forward to a nice dinner with water show. From a peek at the prices ahead of time, I thought that this was going to be a very special dinner. Turns out, not so much.   We both ordered the baby wedge salad which comes with bacon. In my mind, bacon should be crispy and thoroughly cooked. What was served was a VERY thick very undercooked slab of meat. I couldn't eat it, hubby had no problem with it.   My fillet steak was charred on the outside as the menu states, I guess that I just expected the char to be less thick and a little moister and more flavorful on the inside.  No salt or pepper on the table. Salt would have helped some.  Hubby's lamb chops were too salty by contrast.   I guess that the bottom line is that if this  were a more reasonably price restaurant, I could call it average. But for the prices they charge, I just call it a disappointment.",

Service is as polished as the decor and the food was absolutely amazing!  My boyfriend and I ordered a Chile Rubbed Double Rib Eye (42 ounces) <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/6Tmjg1p2U8EYaySIqHKC3g/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a>  <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/3ANdRKAPaezXHTim2WJ7bg/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a>  with a side of au gratin potatoes <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/AEJ3iNao509CxEEBhrtXfg/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a> .  Definitely one of the best Rib eye steak I have ever tasted.  Cooked perfectly medium rare just the way I like it, it came in this huge hot plate that kept the steak warm until we were done eating it.  I didn't think we would finish it all, but we ended up eating everything. The gratin was good, but it was too much flavor to eat with the Chile flavor on the Rib Eye.  I definitely don't get to dine out like this all the time.  I wonder if I would appreciate it as much if I were to dine like this all the time...    5 stars!  I definitely want to come back here again!",

First, we ordered a bottle of wine, which recommended by the waiter, but after tasting, we asked if we can change to another bottle, the waiter told us \"this is what Cabernet taste like\" with very rude tone... We are speechless. Even if you don't allow people to change, you can simply tell us a yes or no would suffice. Second, we ordered our appetizers and main dish together, but after the appetizers were finished by us, we waited around 30 mins to get the main course! The table next to us had already finished! Third, during our entire time, the waiter never came to ask us how was the food and what not. We had to call for the waiter to come to clean our table. He didn't even asked us do we need a box or something. Fourth, i ordered the domestic wagyu, which is just average, not worth the price. After he served the check to us, we complained that the steak is not very good. He told us\"you should tell me earlier\". We ARE telling you now!  All in all, very bad restaurant with such high price and bad service and bad taste. I can easily find 10 more restaurants have better steak than what they have. Don't waste your precious money in this place.",

We called last minute for reservations on a very busy weekend and the hostess was very friendly and accommodating to get us in. The food was cooked to perfection and the desserts were over the top both in taste and presentation. Our waiter Alan helped make the experience great engaging us in conversation and making us feel like we were the only table he was waiting on. Highly recommend the scallops and the filet mignon with all three availiable dipping sauces. For dessert the funnel cakes chocolate, salted caramel, and vanilla dipping sauces is a must, very picture worthy presentation. To top things off the restaurant is situated next to a water fall feature that can be heard no matter where you are seated which adds to the ambiance. We will be returning for sure",

My mom and I shared everything from the app entree and dessert. No grimaces for sharing no added fee. Just amazingly pleasant server after server.  Most places make you feel cheap for doing this. But my mother and myself are very petite women. Finishing a nine oz filet is a feat.  Not including app bread side and dessert.   You have a main server a hostess the servers that bring water utensils bread butter ect. The service was so amazing I would have gone back even if the food wasn't. But... The filet was cooked perfectly. Not a single lump in the Yukon mashed puree that was piping hot. Selection of bread was fabulous and included white, pretzel and bacon cheddar. Steve Wynn knows what he's doing. I will come here every time I'm in Vegas! Every time!! What a great ending to Mother's Day . Thank you so much SW staff.   As an added tip let it be known you CAN and are allowed to smoke on the outside patio directly located in front of the lake/water show feature. Keep this in mind when being seated whether your pro or con smoking .",

We ordered:  Oysters - very fresh and tasty - 4 stars   Brussel sprouts - super flavorful and perfectly cooked - 5 stars  Macaroni and cheese - unique and well done - 4 stars  Creamed corn - amazing texture and taste - 5 stars  Double cut chili rubbed rib eye (40 ounces) - flavor was amazing but was overcooked - sent it back after eating a few pieces and they were extremely accommodating and apologetic and offered to bring us another cut of meat. We were already pretty full so decided to get the filet. (Was removed from bill without discussion) 2 stars  Filet - ordered rare - cooked berfectly. BEST filet I have ever had and we have been fortunate enough to dine at numerous very well-thought-of steak houses across the country. This filet was easily the best I have ever had. Charred perfectly. It could be cut with a fork - 5 stars!!!  Service was impeccable and better than any high end restaurant on the strip. Extremely professional. - 5 stars!!   View and ambiance - 5 stars   I wouldn't normally give a steakhouse 5 stars that served us overcooked meat; however, even though this was disappointing, the restaurant made up for it in every other way.    Tip: If the weather is decent, the patio is stunning and gives you a front row view to the fountain show starting at 730.",

    "text": "**************************** REVIEW 877 ********************************          SW Steakhouse bears Steve Wynn namesake, you would have thought the place would be top notch from food to service. I've been here a few times since the opens years ago, but this recent visit last week was a disappointment.          The service was a major let down. Our table of 6, sitting by the water show, big deal yeah? Daniel Boulud former resto was next door with the same view no?! That's what I mean. Our server has a co-server which couldn't get us the Champagne after I asked 3 times. There was at least 5 bus boys standing around helpless every time we asked for something. It was a Wednesday evening July 17th to be exact.         I've been to Vegas enough at many top restos... especially I'v been here every month this year because of business, to have this kind of service is completely unacceptable!   FOOD: -Oysters on the half Shell - cocktail sauce, red wine mignonette  - Maryland Blue Crab-cake - shaved fennel, orange, herb remoulade -  too sweet for my taste  - Sauteed Hudson Valley Foie Gras - spiced cranberry, golden raisin-celery root chutney - nice and generous portion.   - Torchon Foie Gras - decent, you can see I go all out because stupid California banned Foie Gras.  - Beef Carpaccio - frisee, fried capers, grilled sourdough, sherry vinaigrette  - BiG eye tuna Cheviche - mango-grapefruit salsa, smoked chile, avocado, sesame crackers - skip it, check out Michael Mina instead.   - King crab salad - was refreshing and good.  - Tomato veggies soup - this was delicious.  - Gnocchi with black truffle - this was a decadent dish, rich and tasty.  - Brocolini, tomato, garlic - good side dish  - yukon Gold potato puree - beautifully done, should order this!  -  The bone in ribeye 20 OZ was only  $58 - this is a STEAL - perfectly cook.  - The 7 OZ wagyu-  $210 was totally worth it. The only option of Wagyu on the menu, really?!? Michelin Starred Alexander's Steakhouse in Nor-Cal puts SW in shame on this selection of Wagyu! With all the money in Vegas, you would expect more!   - Pan roasted Sea SCallops - English pea risotto, pea vines, black truffle sauce - nicely done.            So the food was hit and miss, the wine selection was excellent, the service was miserable. We waited 30 minutes from appertizers to entree on a WED night, with no major conference in town!           Would I return, if it was my vendors pay for my meal. If it was my choice, I prefer StripSteak, Prime or Jean-Georges! Nuff said!",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER. For this year's birthday weekend, we hit up three high end steakhouses, back-to-back. This place does NOT deserve to be called high end with the type of \"service\" they provide.  SOOO RUDE.  So, reservation at 9:30, got there a little past 9, checked in and within 5 min got seated (corner seat, along the wall, cushion seat). No problems yet.   Then comes trouble.  This guy, Alassandro, our server, rushing us and trying to get to different tables. Dude, please, my shoes cost more than your paycheck.   Throughout the night he came by 4 times: when we sat, to take our order, to check up once, and to get the $$$. He literally checked up on us ONCE to refill water. We literally had to call him over.  Another server, the one who brought out the food (didn't get his name) wasn't any better. Brings our steak (the recommended chile rubbed double ribeye $125) and side (black truffle creamed corn $12) and says something along the lines of, \"do you need me to serve you, I mean, the chef already cut it for you.\" REALLY? AS A SERVER YOU'RE GUNNA LEAVE US WITH A $125 STEAK AND HAVE US SERVE OURSELVES?   We beg him to go out of his way, obviously, because he has better things to do, to pleassseeeee serve us and he does.. leaving our black truffle creamed corn in the far corner of the table, out of reach, to just chill. Thanks man, really appreciate it.  and no, it does not stop there.  By now, the BF and I are pretty aggravated and want to just leave before we make a scene. Good thing we just got two things.   We ask for the bill and to get our food (more than half the food) to-go. I'm not even done with my plate, Alassandro doesn't even ask, takes it away. Ok, I guess I'm done. I guess he realized he made a mistake but acts cool and asks the BF, **START QUOTE** U DONE? **END QUOTE**   WHUT?   Even at TGIFriday's they ask if they can clear the table. RUDE!  Honestly, never coming back. These servers act like they're too good to be serving.   The steak sucked. Service sucked. Ambience sucked. I'm sticking with CUT. At least there, they got all three of these DOWN! Best service, amazing steak, clean cut look.",

    "text": "***Update August 2016***  After writing this review and emailing the hotel (both guest and dining emails), there has been no reply. Considering that the restaurant replies to bad reviews on Yelp, itself, yet it didn't reply back to my review shows how classless the restaurant staff has become.  I've thought long and hard about this, but you know what? I think I win. Let me explain. This middle-aged blonde hostess works at a restaurant she can't afford but acts like she is better than everyone (Nothing against people who work in restaurants. I worked as a server for seven years, and I also treat everyone with equal respect in and out of business. I'm just against pretentious people who think they're better than everyone). All she saw was that our eyes were slanted, apparently. Why I saw I win is, while she's on her high horse along with management while being middle-aged and working at a restaurant she can't afford, my parents taught me to treat people with respect, no matter who you are, so good luck with your life and treating Asians and other customers like bugs because you're obviously succeeding in life by acting better than everyone. :)  ***End update***  My parents, husband, and I first came to SW Steakhouse in April for my mom's birthday because we read all the great reviews and wanted to try out the amazing Kobe steaks. Everything was beyond perfect. Food was one of the best meals we have ever had, service was very cordial, and we had a table right on the patio next to the lake. Absolute perfection. It was worth every penny.   This trip in August, we came to Vegas for my dad's birthday as well as mine. There was no other restaurant we wanted to celebrate at than SW Steakhouse. I made reservations for us and requested a table inside by the window. The lady I spoke to was very accommodating. Upon arrival to the restaurant, however, our entire attitude changed. We entered excited, anticipating the delicious steaks and delectable side dishes. From the second we walked in, the hostess with the straight blonde hair in a red shirt and black pantsuit in the front made our celebratory mood go away. She looked at us, said hello with no smile at all and more of an annoyed expression. I told her we had a reservation, which she looked for, and then she continued to tell my husband that men cannot wear shorts to the restaurant. I totally understood. We understand there are rules at restaurants and dress codes. That's why we all dressed up. My husband had a polo on, and the shorts he was wearing were nice shorts, and he only wore them because it's over 100 degrees in Vegas. Her delivery of the statement, however, was the reason I am writing this. She said that men weren't allowed to wear shorts and that there was a restaurant elsewhere, basically telling us to leave because we weren't good enough. Had she explained to us kindly that my husband couldn't wear shorts, none of us would have been offended. We understand dress codes exist. My husband offered to go back to our hotel at Aria to change, and so she sat us......at literally the worst table in the restaurant. She sat us behind a giant pillar when we had requested a table by the window days in advance. There were no other guests at any of those tables at all. I honestly believe it is because she was racist at Asians. She never smiled at us and was very rude and condescending to us, but every other white customer who came in was treated with friendly banter and smiles. WE EVEN SAW A OLDER WHITE MALE CUSTOMER LEAVING AFTER DINNER WITH THE EXACT SAME SHORTS ON!   When we spoke to the manager about this, we weren't expecting any handouts. We just wanted to convey our feelings to him because how we were treated is not right at all, especially at this type of restaurant. He came over, we explained the situation. He said he was sorry it was disappointing to us, listened, apologized, and then walked off. The thing that irks me, however, is that he was talking with her all night and laughing with her, so obviously he is biased in this situation and won't do anything. If anything, he probably went over and told her how silly we were. He went over to her immediately and they both looked over at our table, and then he walked away. That was literally it.   I am so disappointed in the hostess because otherwise the experience would have been amazing again. My parents felt so embarrassed and upset because they thought they were singled out for being Asian, and my husband had to rush back to our hotel fifteen minutes away and change when again, we saw another man with the exact same type of nice shorts. We left a generous tip because it wasn't the waiter's fault. Just Watch out for the hostess with long blond straight hair if you're Asian or anything that she doesn't think is good enough.",

We had higher expectations for a 5 star restaurant where you're paying $125 for a steak.  We had to ask for refills, the plates were not cleared after each course, no one asked us how our food was or if we needed anything.  It wasn't busy so there is really no excuse for the poor service especially when you're spending $800 on dinner.",

    "text": "We have been to SW many times.... I recommend SW to everyone I know going to Vegas for their great food, interesting atmosphere and \"the frog\" or \"balls\" or \"lips\".   On this occasion, however, our experience was instantly tainted by a real stronzo (use google translate to Italian, if you'd like to know what that means) by the name of Fabrice.   Fabrice greeted us... or better, looked us up and down. Me in my Louboutin's, Nicole Miller gown and my husband in his Gucci shoes and Burberry suit... and apparently he was displeased. We had just gotten to Vegas, I had made our reservations months in advance and we smiled, said hello and told him of our reservation.   He said, \"Patio\" and I corrected him saying we'd made a reservation on the glass, on the patio. He intently stared and me, I stared right back and he said that it was 7:30pm on a Wednesday in Las Vegas and there was no glass seats on the patio available. I asked how long we'd need to wait and he said that there wouldn't be one available this evening.   I was not a happy girl. This was, up until now, our favorite restaurant in Vegas. We have been a dozen times, we have had friends go because we've suggested it and we always spend a pretty penny. Being So Cal folks, we love their foie gras, a delicacy we can no longer enjoy in the golden state!   A kind hostess, said she had a great table, wonderful view of the \"show\" and it was 1/2 inside and 1/2 outside... I looked at my husband, who really wanted some Foie Gras and we decided to stay. Despite my better judgement... there are a lot of fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas.   Upon being seated, something because strikingly obvious... there was not one, but two seats for two, right on the glass.   WHAT A STRONZO! We were furious......   Clearly this seems like an overreaction, but when you are accustomed to great service, at this restaurant (and other), this was just an obvious \"he doesn't like us\" \"we don't belong here\" kind of thing and that makes me mad.   I hate being discrimnated against and there was clearly a case of that going on.   As usual, the Foie Gras appetizer was fabulous, the ribeye topped with seared foie gras was  good (not great, the ribeye) our wine from James the Sommelier (Relic Cabernet) was perfect and our after dinner port was delightful.   Mike and Corey, our servers were fantastic, attentive and kind... but it's hard to put a better taste in our mouth after Fabrice.   I doubt we will go back to SW, having dined and spent nearly double at CUT the next night... with EXCEPTIONAL service and flawless food... I think we found a new favorite and a new place to recommend (at our favorite hotel too, Palazzo, where we stay).   All in all, I'm disappointed. We really liked SW... it was special to us. Perhaps one day we'll go back... but if it's Fabrice who's greeting us.... I will walk right back out.",

The brussel sprouts were quite different. They were served with a mustard cream sauce, which may win some taste buds over, maybe just not mine. Would have preferred just a roasted brussel sprout with a vinaigrette or garlic.   We did love the pretzel bread, took that to go. Best pretzel bread ever!",

    "text": "This place...  I had extremely high hopes for this place after reading reviews, and seeing some youtube videos on the chef.  Sadly the night went horribly and I was stuck with a bad taste in my mouth and a 300 dollar check.  Me and a group of friends started planned this outing as we visit high end restaurants around town around every month or so.  It's normally a great light hearted excursion were we cast aside price, and focus on getting some really great food.  We started at the bar right outside, and waited for our reservation time, and were seated a few minutes later.  Me and the GF started with the crab cakes.  These were incredible.  Light and fluffy, yet firm enough to eat with a fork.  By far the best part of the meal as the service slid quickly down hill shortly after.  The GF doesn't eat red meat, so she got the fish, and how can I pass up the 130 dollar big boy of them all... The porter house.  So the time comes for our table to receive our main course, and right off the bat, they forgot my Girlfriend's fish...  WTF?  The waiter checks in note pad, and there it is glaring him in his face that he just botched up a meal that will cost more than he is going to make in the day.  Not a good start.  They manage to hustle one out for her from the kitchen about 10 minutes after we all started eating.  So the couple sitting across from me got the same steak as me, only they were planning on splitting it.  Makes sense, it is steak for 2 right? I wanted left overs, so I got one just for me.  So our steaks come out, along with about 10 people serving our table of 6, and there is silverware, and vegetables flying everywhere as these people quickly and efficiently serve taters, and veggies.  Than comes time for them to serve the meat...  My 130 dollar piece of delicious porterhouse was put on other people's plates.  Let that sink in.  130 dollar steak, gets it's serving botched.  I'm pissed when I see this, but calmly call over the waiter after the dust settles.  He asks me what can he do for me to make me happy?  Good answer right?  WRONG!  I tell him I just paid 130 bucks to have my meat given to everyone else, and I don't think I should have to pay for 130 dollars in steak, when 85 bucks worth of it is sitting on other people's plates!  I'n not going to eat the other couples meat, as they had their grubby mits in it already, and hell that's their steak not mine.  His response was to comp me a Jim Beam and Coke from the bar.  yes...  Comp me a 6 dollar drink...  that should make up for your incompetence.  You ruined my entire dining experience, and now I'm vegan...  Next Christmas will not be spent at this establishment.",

I would have to say the food was executed very well. We had Wagyu steak, King Crab legs which was absolutely delicious. Halibut, Filets, Chicken, Ribeye.  I didn't have one bad thing to say. That is very rare believe me when I say that.  Bread was really good especially the pretzel.   Servers were a little slow at clearing plates. But did hustle when asked to clear them.

The food was great as well... our steaks were cooked to perfection and I recommend getting your steak topped with the crispy garlic and rosemary.  Absolutely fantastic!

    "text": "Very nice---but noisy--place. Why is it so noisy at the Wynn and Encore? Fellow Yelper Jim T. and I went to this place because we like a good steak and will try it anywhere. We decided to split the 40 ounce Porterhouse. Not only do you get more meat, but it is cheaper than getting two steaks of any size separately.   I started with a wedge that I asked to be chopped. They chopped it, but it was way overdone with Bleu Cheese. The bacon was not very flavorful and overdoing the Bleu Cheese only made this dish average.   Now to the steak: We ordered it medium. It came Medium-rare on the strip side, but well done (no pink) on the fillet side. What saved the day here, is Jim T didn't mind the medium rare and the flavor was very good. It was crusted just so, with a hint of salt and pepper.   I asked for the SW sauce and the server brought out a trio of sauces: The SW sauce, (which is sort of an A-1/barbeque blend thingy), Worcestershire, and a hot pepper sauce. I skipped the hot pepper stuff.   Side dishes were grilled asparagus and au gratin potatoes. The sides were very nice and complimented the meal.   After dinner we felt like a drink. I noticed they had vanilla ice cream for desert and asked if they could do a Brandy Alexander for me. \"Sorry, Sir, we can not do that since there is not a blender at the bar.\"  \"No blender anywhere?\" I said.  \"Sorry, sir. It would take forever to get drinks out of the bar if we were blending drinks.\" He said. Really. He said this! Interesting that Applebees and Chili's can figure out how to run an efficient bar, but The Wynn can't? Really?   Anyway we settled for a glass of Port that was very good.   I really wanted to like this place. And will if I have a better experience next time. The steak was very good--if not how we ordered it. So, I will give it a provisional two stars now--may change it later.   Overall I enjoyed Switch more (see my yelp on that) because the steak was better.   And Steve, get the bar a blender.",

Your corporate guests will be over the top pleased.   Located in the Wynn hotel, on the lower level, the restaurant is in cased in all glass with outdoor seating that looks out to a waterfall that cascades into a still body of water. On the top of the waterfall there is a gigantic fabric frog lite up and sways in the wind. Once the show starts, the frog disappears and huge flowers come out from the wall. It's Vegas fabulous for sure. They have the water show about every 30 minutes that will have you and all your guests mesmerized. No one does it like they do in Vegas.

We dined at SW @ The Wynn last night and while the staff was great and the wine list was well rounded I felt the food and the atmosphere were just OK.    The decor looks like just about any hotel restaurant in any big city and doesn't really have an distinguishing features.  The tables are nice and big and our table of 7 had plenty of room for glasses, side plates etc.    As for the menu the starters looked more inter sting then the mains for the most part.  I guess if you are looking for a straight-ahead steak then you'd not be disappointed.  The Roasted Hen was also quite nice as was the rack of lamb.  My heirloom tomato was trying a little to hard and over sauced.    Maybe I'm just not used to the no frills attitude that most steak houses tend to rock and need to adjust my expectations.  The nice thing about the Wynn is that there's always somewhere else to try.",

The only thing really keeping them from a five star rating is the front end service at the hostess stand. I've read that is a problem for some of the other reviewers, so if I was SW, I'd really get to retraining the hostess to learn to handle that front station and first impression of the place much better.  We stood and waited for the hostess's attention for about 8 minutes and finally walked up to someone else and asked if we could be seated. He immediately apologized and sat us at a perfect table waterside with an ideal view of the Lake of Dreams and its shows.  The food was outstanding. We shared a Chateaubriand with peppercorn crust, cooked medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. The Brussels sprouts with bacon and creamed corn with truffle oil were both fabulous and the SW chopped salad and heirloom tomato salad were also perfect.  Service was spectacular with five different people plus a knowledgeable sommelier serving us. Our glasses were never dry, and iced tea and water not just Champagne stayed full, which I think is a great sign of how good the service is.  For dessert we shared a chocolate souffle cake which was just okay as souffles go, really more of a flourless chocolate cake than a souffle. Iced tea was also not that great, which is surprising since the tea at Wynn's Terrace Point Cafe and the former Sugar & Ice (now a pizza place) are China Mist, one of the best.  Overall, a place with killer atmosphere, great views, entertaining shows, outstanding service, fabulous food and only lacking in front of house hostess service, iced tea and chocolate souffle.",

We had a seat right along the waterfall and was treated to some of the trippiest artistic visuals I've ever experience (and I've visualized quite a bit if you know what I mean)    I got the ribeye and wife got the filet with bleu cheese.  We both made grunts and groans with every bite.  I was so impressed.  This was the best steak I have ever had.    Our meal cost a lot of money, but we knew that going in.  This was probably one of the most memorable dining experiences I have ever had.  I hope one day I can go back.",

If you manage to get a table with a window view, you would see the shows while you enjoy your meal.  The food was expensive, but good.  Service was good too.  They have dress code.  Business casual.  Gentlemen require at least a shirt with collar and a pair of designer jeans with no holes.  Jacket is optional.  Of course you can wear anything more formal than that.  No spec for ladies though.  The lack of lady dress code reminds me of the movie \"Pretty Woman\".  I've just noticed I have passed the 200 reviews mark with this review.",

    "text": "We went here for our anniversary and made a reservation requesting to be seated near the window which looks out onto the waterfall.  The view is gorgeous but the the odd piece to this is the two naked statues in the waterfall.  kinda funny actually...  The outside seating was unavailable due to the extreme 115 degree heat (not that I would sit outside anyway, the thought of sweating white eating makes me gag).    Upon our arrival, the hostess seats us in the back of the restaurant in which I complained, however the reply I received was, \"I'm sorry, there are no seats available in that section.  You can speak to the manager if you have any further questions.\"  Then why do I see seats available in that section?  Argh, then what's the point of making an effing reservation.  Anyway, that soured the beginning of my experience with the SW steakhouse.  We shared the 42 oz double cut rib eye and had the creamed spinach for a side.  The rib eye was satisfactory, Kenny liked it a lot better than I did (perhaps I still had a sour taste in my mouth from the whole seating arrangement).    Initially, I give this restaurant 2 stars.  I think customer service is extremely important in any institution. However their redeeming point is that they gave us a complimentary creme brulee dessert plate etched in chocolate, \"Happy Anniversary.\"  Flemmings is still my number one steakhouse",

    "text": "Had some high expectations when we booked our reservation here. Friends from home highly recommended SW Steakhouse for the food, drink, and atmosphere. Sadly, I was underwhelmed with the most important part of that list - the food. The bone-in ribeye came cooked exactly as I requested but it was way too salty. Like whoa - go easy on that thick ass seasoning you guys rub into it. The three sauces provided for the steak puzzled me, as I'm used to eating steak two different ways - the fancy crap that is cooked well enough to eat 'as-is' (shout-out to my boys at Flemmings), and the Denny's cooked meat that I drown in A1 sauce. So yeah - if you need to provide sauce with your steaks, then you'd better be a family franchise with a kids-menu and crayons. I do recognize that some people may enjoy the sauces for some slight variations on their plate... but it ain't for me.  There is a dress code here, but I didn't see it enforced for several people being served that night. I suppose if you roll in with some Uncle Benjamins, any rule can be broken in Vegas. Service was top-notch and the atmosphere is relaxing with the Wynn waterfall right outside the lounge area.  Someone try the Wagyu Beef from Japan ($175 for 7oz) or the Ohmi Beef ($245 for 7oz). I wasn't crazy enough to order those, but I figure if you hit the jackpot, then you might as well try it and tell us how it is... along with the strippers you hire that night afterwards. Word.",

I had the shrimp cocktail to start, followed by the salmon (excellent) and shared a couple of sides with my husband (charred jalapenos, creamed spinach, and a combo of the fingerling potatoes and green beans).. then we were given a truly divine dessert sampler which included chocolate cake (amazing), strawberry bread pudding (pretty good) and the funnel cakes with dipping sauces (excellent). What really makes the evening special is the ambiance and the interesting light/music shows on the lake every half hour. Our server was attentive and we had a really wonderful time.

    "text": "If you're in Vegas and want dinner to be a memorable experience rather than just a meal, whether it's to impress a client, a big date, or for some other special occasion, I'd recommend SW Steakhouse.    It's IMPORTANT to note that when you make your reservation you should request a view of the waterfall; there's no point in going to SW if you can't see it.  Many of the tables are positioned in a semicircle around the waterfall, which cascades into a pool of water.  But the waterfall itself isn't particularly picturesque; instead, what's impressive is the music/light show that takes place around it approximately every 30 minutes.  The night I ate at SW there were numerous interludes including a Garth Brooks song sang by a giant frog (I realize that may sound rather annoying ... you just had to be there).  Other interludes were more low key, including classical music while giant flowers appear and twirl about the waterfall.  The service was top notch and the wine server was very knowledgeable about the wine list (but as other reviewers have noted, the wine is very overpriced).    We enjoyed our steak and the sides of potatoes and asparagus were delicious.  Overall, I'd say the food quite good, but not notably better than at any other quality steak house.  *BUT*, the show's the thing at SW; it turns what would otherwise be a nice but overpriced steakhouse into a noteworthy dining experience.",

My wife ordered a Sangria which she loved. One of our favorite things about SW and Lakeside Seafood right across from SW is they serve fresh preztel bread right out of the oven. Unreal! We couldn't get enough of it. For our salad we have Steve's salad kind of like a ceasar salad with a little more zest, excellent. We split a crab cake for our appetizer which was wonderful, great fresh crab flavors. We both had salmon for our entree which was perfectly cooked, even better than the fish we had at Lakeside Seafood next door. It came with a mushroom sauce underneath the fish which you dip your fish into, very savory deep flavors. I had mine blackened which I loved, just the right amount of spice and my wife had hers broiled, she was very pleased. We ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes which was a garlic lovers dream come True, tons of fresh garlic in there.   For dessert we shared a chocolate cake with a little dish of vanilla custard, it was small but just enough to give us a little finishing touch for dessert. The coffee we ordered was excellent as well. Our waiter Mark and bus people Lea and Jesus did an excellent job of taking care of us.     I almost forgot the show on the lake makes this even more worth the price of admission. They have four or five different 2min holographic shows on the lake every half hour. Really makes the whole night special. Highly recommended.",

There's a nice view of the Wynn waterfalls from inside and out, where ever you might choose to dine. Although in my opinion, the person who designed the waterfall shows is really, um, unique?  Interesting to say the least.  The food was great, from the cheese bread in the beginning to the desserts at the end. The caeser salad, creamed spinach and cheese potatoes are some of the best we've had.  Not to mention the tender juicy steaks.  You can't lose here.  Still not cheap, but a good value in vegas.",

We were told to \"have a seat\", but that it might \"be a while\", since this was a Friday night. Not long after, we were seated at the most awkwardly placed table near the corner of the restaurant. Absolutely no view of the Lake (which was one of the selling points from everyone, and something I was looking forward to!), and we were crowded into a half-booth/half-table between two other couples. The serving staff was nice enough, considering we were terribly disappointed, but they didn't do much to make our experience any more personal, due to the fact that they were taking care of our \"boothmates\" as well. I lost my interest in ordering any appetizers, and focused on the steak. Now, that filet was AMAZING! So much flavor, cooked to perfection, and just wonderful. I was pretty anxious to leave after that, I just couldn't justify spending any more time and money here when I was not having a good time.  So, we passed on the desserts as well (sooooo not like me!). I don't think I will be back here again, which is a shame because the food was fabulous! But right from the start we were made to feel as though we were a bother, since there was a mix-up with our reservation. The decor is beautiful and I'm sure the show is great, but if you're looking for a more intimate experience, keep looking!",

I have eaten outstanding steaks in some of the beef centers of the United States -- the stockyards in Oklahoma City; the stockyards in Fort Worth, Texas; Kansas City; and Kamuela, Hawaii.

Fork-tender, trimmed to perfection, flavored to enhance but not outshine the beef; and grilled absolutely right!  The New York steak was prepared medium as ordered, and the filet mignon was exactly medium rare also as ordered.  The creamed corn with truffle and SW fries were excellent, and the chocolate souffle was warm and decadent.  But the True star of the dinner was the steaks!  If you appreciate quality steaks, you must dine at SW Steakhouse at the Wynn!

There's nothing memorable about the food here. If you're looking for a steakhouse for a special occasion, I would highly recommend Craftsteak at the MGM Grand instead, which has a lot more polish, attention to detail and much better food.  Salad -- Overdressed, but ok. King Crab Pasta -- a terrible, creamy mess.  Mushroom side -- Incredibly salty and inedible. Asparagus side -- ok.  Filet Mignon -- excellent, cooked perfectly. Funnel cake dessert -- really fun, cool presentation, ok taste.   We ordered two bottles of wine at the table and the sommelier was solid. I didn't sit at the bar, but I'd imagine that it would be pretty good there.   Bottom line: If you're staying at the Wynn and looking for a good place to eat and drink, this will do -- the food is good.

Absolutely great. 4 guys split the double cutbrib eye with chili rub. Also great. Sharing was a good idea as it would have been too much food for 2 and we are not lite eaters. Yes it is expens oh very but people who rate a restaurant  low because of the price suck. It is what it is and you generally know what youbare getting before you arrive. Two resounding thumbs up for SW!",

    "text": "SW was an absolutely amazing dining experience. I came with a group of 9. The table we had was right next to the outdoor waterfall area, which was perfect for a hot summer evening. The staff always made sure to check in on how everyone was doing. The 20 oz bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare and was so tender and flavorful. The creamed corn was delicious and the wild mushrooms were sauteed well. The shrimp scampi were huge and a little on the saltier side, but cooked well and buttery. The lobster tail was decadent. Overall this was a great experience and I would highly recommend trying it at least once while you are in Vegas!",

    "text": "LDW 2011 in Vegas!!!! We were celebrating my birthday at SW on Monday night because Sunday night at Mastro's was a bust due to food poisoning from the Lobby Bar in Encore. Read my review and be advised to stay away from the spicy shrimp!!!!   Ok on to SW --  Service - 3.5 stars He was attentive but not annoying. Just wish he could've mustered up a little more enthusiasm. I heard they pool the tips so I guess they don't really have any incentive to pretend they are happy to serve us dinner.  Food - 2.75 Are you kidding me with $62 for a 12oz filet and $12 per side?!  I know it's Encore and I know it's Vegas, but I also know what these things cost at the grocery store and I don't even buy in bulk like a hotel!!!  My husband and I decided to split everything. We started with the iceberg lettuce salad with blue cheese, bacon and tomato. It did not wow me, but it didn't break the bank either.  We ordered the 12oz filet and a side of creamed corn. I like my filets still mooing and he likes leather shoes.  Mine came out medium and his came out medium well.   Not good for a steak restaurant to mess up their main event, but we were in a time crunch, so there was no sending food back to the kitchen!!!   I have to say it certainly was not the best I ever ate and not worth the ridiculous amount of money.  The creamed corn was just plain odd. Our friends ordered a caesar salad, filets, and a side of mac & cheese. They enjoyed their filet, but the mac and cheese was sub par.  The decor and ambience - 3 stars Nothing super fancy especially considering the overpriced food and the view of the dreamscape was a little much during dinner.   Yeah yeah cool your jets!!!  I know it's Vegas, but I want to know what  kind of drugs the creator was on that decided that set up was a good idea. The demographics for the peeps that can afford to eat there and those who may be interested in that wackiness is way off!!!  Bartenders - 3.5 stars for heavy hands on the liquor Watch out the drinks will knock you out with one punch. So order wisely and proceed with caution.  3.5 stars for bringing me mints and a plate with a birthday greeting on it.   Overall 3.0 stars for the experience Would I return to SW? Probably not because there are so many fine restaurants that are truly worth every penny in Vegas. Encore I think you can do better.",

Yes this may seem silly. However, other high end restaurants in NYC and overseas that I have been to will clean the table in between plate change. Second thing, we had a very fine French red wine 2012, released in 2017. This bottle was not placed in a decanter therefore the sediment was in the bottle and our glasses.

    "text": "As soon as I knew I was going to Vegas I started to scout out some pretty nice steakhouses. I read a lot of reviews from other steak places but SW seemed to be the winner and I couln't wait to eat there. So two days before I got there I made reservations for 6pm and had no problems doing that.  So one of the main attractions is the lake and the light show which I missed because I left before it got too dark. I thought it was require to wear a jacket or at least a tie so I wore a tie. When I got there I was the only one wearing a tie and I thought wtf? Well anyway it's cool because I was there for the steak and boy was it good. The service was outstanding and my waitress was Katie who was so attentive. I couldn't believe how GREAT she was and I could probably write a whole review on just her.  Okay so food time, I ordered a Candied Orange cocktail which was very good but very STRONG too. I did like it but I'm also a light weight so I was out of my league with that one. I ordered a NY medium rare with smoked blu cheese and that's what I got. It was very good but I thought it was going to blow my socks off but it didn't. So that's why I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 but the service is definetly 5 stars no doubt about it. I also got some mashed potatoes which they called Yukon puree or something which I thought was funny. I didn't get any apperziters because I had big plans for that NY, plus they give me some very delicous bread with butter that had Hawaiian sea salt on it with olive oil. WOW !!! That butter was so damn good I think they should sell it somehow.  When I come back to Vegas I just may stop by to give Katie an extra tip, yeah she was that damn good. I would most likey eat here again also but I would try a different drink. I had a great time at the SW and can't wait to come back!",

It was a risk bringing friends to a restaurant I hadn't tried, but my co-workers insisted this was a safe bet. They weren't wrong.  We started with drinks and a lovely variety of breads. For dinner my husband and I shared the chile rubbed double rib-eye that lived up to all of the hype. There was plenty of steak and flavor for the two of us. It was perfectly tender on the inside of the slices with the perfect amount of crisp on the outside. We ordered a potato dish that had lavender mixed in and a chive topping. It was a unique twist on the usual potato. My pecan blonde brownie was very tasty and had just the right amount of bourbon flavor.   The ambiance and vibe of the restaurant would make this great for a date or a group gathering.",

When it was time for our reservation, the hostess came to the bar to get us-very good first impression    Our servers were very knowledgeable and super sweet. They kept very good care of us the entire time we were there.   We both had shrimp cocktails and then the 8oz filets which were cooked to perfection. The steaks were delicious and tender.

It was very well prepared and went along great with the 2010 Chianti! Not surprising - their beer selection is quite sub-par. Can you offer draft beer and still be classy? Yes, of course IMO, but guess the glitterati here does not agree with me. In any case they had one IPA - a l micro-brew from San Diego. Loved it!  Decadent desserts were to follow. The group went for it but I preferred the espresso double-shot. Mediocre brew at best. Avoid the temptation - don't leave room for dessert- LOL!",

My recommendations - * creamed truffle corn * porter house (1 serving is enough for 2) * eating on the balcony",

Any and every time there is a a special event, I always pick this restaurant :)  To start, this is the first placed i've tried caviar at, the Kolikof caviar they carry is superior, I swear I wish I could order it every time (but its $$$$)  Appetizers are always delicious. I usually like to order some of the a5 for a nice little appetizer.   Steaks are amazing, I am a sucker for seafood so I always order the lobster tail, the preparation on the lobster tail is phenomenal, by far one of the best i've ever had.",

Oysters on the 1/2 shell and that was sooooo delish!!!! cold and fresh!!! Jidori Chicken Breast ... according to my partner it was juicy and it was like chicken butter. I got the 24 oz Bone in rib eye..(Medium Rare outside crisp). OMG to die for seriously... cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth and i couldn't finish it because it was so big hahaha..... Au Gratin potatoes as a side was delish too!!!... what a treat for me to spend my 36th birthday!!!! will be back again =) Oh and the complimentary birthday cake was amazing too even though I dont eat cake hahha... had a few bites.

To make matters worse, when I asked our waitress about the toughness of my steak, she refused to answer my question and became incredibly rude.  As a matter of fact, the only time we saw her again was when she brought us the bill after dinner.  The cheddar bacon biscuits are as good as ever, but I simply cannot endorse going to this restaurant ever again after this experience.  I used to tell people that SW had the best steak I've ever had.  Sadly, this is no longer True.  Vegas has many fine restaurants at this price point.  Look elsewhere.",

We arrived at our reservation on Sunday at 8:00pm sharp since we were staying at the Wynn. Even though the restaurant was pretty empty, we still had to wait over 10 minutes. We were also seated at the VERY BACK of the restaurant on a very small table top when the restaurant was empty. We had ZERO view and the hostess seated a group of 2 next to our table when the restaurant was empty. We ordered a bottle of wine (+$800), seafood tower (+$100) and Kobe steak ($250). The food and service was great, but I will never be returning to this restaurant after we were seated at literally the WORST table in the restaurant when the restaurant never became full.",

I made the reservation 3 weeks ago and requested a lakeside table which was denied as they give preference to reservations made chronologically.  I was a bit disappointed but so glad we stayed.  Our hostess was young, beautiful and poised. It was refreshing.  The clientele is fashionable, put together and very civilized. The restaurant itself is beautiful, perfect lighting and feels classy. We waited near the bar while our table was being set. The bartenders know how to make a straight Goose martini . We were seated in the far back corner. A very private corner booth table. While we were unable to see the lake show, we did have a nice view of other tables in the restaurant. Our servers were down to earth, fun, friendly and attentive. We were attended to by Nicole, Chris, Jorge, and other gentleman who was also very helpful.  The bread basket was a nice treat. My boyfriend being German, was particularly impressed by the pretzel roll. Don't eat too much bread because the menu items are worth the wait!  We ordered the steak- perfect MR with bearnaise sauce on the side. It was not too rich. We also had fries, lobster gnocchi and the chopped salad. We shared everything and it was the perfect amount of food for the both of us. We were both stuffed and happy. The coffee and cookie cheesecake were a perfect way to end the meal.  Throughout dinner, our servers were attentive but not overbearing.  They had the right finesse when coming to our table and the perfect sense to know when we  needed something.  It was 1130pm by the time we finished our meal and the tables near the lake of dreams were emptying. We sat at one of the tables to watch the lake show. And honestly, it was so underwhelming. In hindsight, I'm glad we didn't sit outside because we were able to focus on each other and our delicious meal. And we had the nicest servers in our area that it couldn't had been any more wonderful. I hope our next visit at SW is just as wonderful. Thank you!",

The waiter we had almost seemed irritated when we asked for a drink, salt and pepper, the check.  No pleasantries from him what so ever. He just seemed unhappy to be there. And for the price we paid for two steaks, mashed potatoes and Mac & cheese, seltzer water and one drink ($$$$$). The service was well under par. Waiter disappeared toward the end and we waited for about 15 mins before he check on us again. The steak (Bone in Rob eye) medium-rare was a low quality meat for the price. There was a substantial amount of grissel in the meat making it harder to chew. I'd recommend well or medium well if order it.",

    "text": "Awesome place to dine. Little pricey, but hey in Vegas your $100 on a $1 machine can go in 3 minutes! Requested a table outside to partake in the outside entertaining show every 1/2 hour and was seated next to the lake. We did go in November and the heaters warmed ya efficiently. Nicole was our waitress and was so down to earth, gave us recommendations that we loved, and so funny and friendly.    Ordered the Ahi Tartare for starters. Splurged on the A5 certified Kobe Rib Eye, filet, 2 lobster tails, and truffle creamed corn and asparagus for sides.  The A5 Kobe is so delicate and delicious I would definitely recommend ordering once in your life. The lobster tails were good size and also included the claws.  For dessert we had the cheesecake which was unbelievable!!   Overall, SW exceeded our expectations with their quality, quantity of food and all the staff are well trained and very friendly. We will definitely be back",

Both steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection.  This restaurant is more of a purest, so you won't find any accoutrements for your steak.  So if your looking for some herb butter or chanterelle mushrooms for your steak you won't find it there. Overall great service great food and you leave very satisfied. You can't ask for more than that!    We ended the meal with a delicious creme brulee. It was topped with blackberries and small meringue cookies which gave a good contrast to the smooth velvety creme brulee.   If your in the Las Vegas strip, definitely make it SW Steakhouse.",

I wish the world was not so ill informed. We paid $100 a steak and I actually had to salt it. I had the dry aged porterhouse and there was no flavor whatsoever. A little taste of charcoaly grill but other than that nothing. Mashed potatoes were runny, octopus was bland.  Service was good and the view of the waterfall was incredible though we were seated in the back behind a column.  To top it all off I would estimate there were about 125 tables in the restaurant and about 60 of them were empty at 6pm. When we left at 7:30pm I would say 40 of them were open. So whose defrauding the people with showing the restaurant was booked solid and why?  Have a reputation to keep?  I wouldn't never waste a precious vacation dinner here again.",

    "text": "As with most everything else at the Wynn/Encore properties, this steakhouse isn't necessarily cheap to dine at, but it's exceptional, and it's worth it!  I came here with a group of 10 at 9:30 on a Friday night for dinner.  We were seated in a private dining area due to the size of our group and the amount of patrons who were in this restaurant when we arrived at our reserved time, but the main dining area and portico have an amazing view of the waterfall, pond and folliage-filled area that make up the \"Lake of Dreams\" just outside this restaurant where the color and texture of the waterfall seems to change every few minutes (due to some high tech projection technology), and a \"show\" plays out I believe every 30 minutes that features music, even more projection and some very cool effects.  Appetizers (salads, crab cakes, tuna civiche, oysters, etc.) average about $21 each, main courses (chicken, fish, lamb, scallops) will run about $40 each, most steaks are in the ball park of $60, and sides to go with your meat or main course are about $12 per side.  An interesting note is that there are a number of vegan options on the menu, which can be a rare find at a steakhouse.  The service was incredible - The staff were obviously professionally trained, polished and were thoroughly knowledgeable about the menu; the food was excellent and the aforementioned atmosphere was pretty amazing as well.  In all, the SW Steakhouse may not be the cheapest dining option in Vegas, but it's well worth it in my opinion, and is definitely a treat in many regards.",

From the amazing rolls to start (the bacon and cheese muffins are can't miss) to the fresh fish on the menu (I had ceviche to start and the scallops as my entree). I also had the chile rubbed rib-eye, which was incredibly juicy and so flavorful.   Save room for dessert, because the presentations alone are worth it - and the flavor matches the presentation. Why not 5-star?  I thought that the service should be a little more detail-oriented for the price.  Our server didn't have strong recommendations, left us way too much time before taking our orders.  The soda that they offer are in the 8-ounce bottles - so you're paying about 5 times more for a diet coke than you would elsewhere.",

They didn't offer us to order something else instead.  While it seems to be a very popular place at the Wynn, it is the least best food they feature and I've been to many of their restaurants.  There are also so many other great steak houses in Las Vegas.  I am only giving it two stars for the ambiance.",

So much flavor! From appetizers we went to the sides: roasted asparagus was very finely cooked while the mushrooms were plentiful and hearty. Was unfortunate to not taste the black truffle cream of corn but had some good reviews from my fellow guests. Finally, the main course! The New York strip was huge, but may had a little too much seasoning. But nevertheless, I've never had a medium rare steak so good before. The rib eye that my partners had was a little too salty. However, the main attraction for me was the pork chops - they tasted fabulous with flavor in every bite. If anything, definitely get the pork chops and foie gras if you go!",

Highlight of the meal was definitely the double cut pepper crusted chateaubriand we shared. It was so tender I was actually able to cut a piece off with my fork! Meal was topped off with a creme brulee that they made special for the birthday girl. All this being said, it is on the expensive side.

I ordered mine Med- Rare but it was a little more towards the rare side, which I didn't mind.  For sides we ordered -  SW french fries - possibly the best fries I've tried in a while! perfectly seasoned, perfectly crispy.  Black truffle cream corn - Very good! a little liquidity but still great flavor especially for corn lovers!  Sauteed wild mushrooms - these don't look like wild mushrooms, more like your standard little brown mushrooms from the supermarket, They are good but nothing special.  Brussels sprouts with sausage and mustard cream - I didn't see any meat in our dish... maybe it all got eaten in the blink of an eye but I tasted no mustard or meat flavor... plan roasted (half raw) brussels!   Glazed carrots - no one really touched this dish. Went uneaten.  We also had the red quinoa farro salad which was really good.  Dessert was the chocolate lava cake with ice cream and cherries on the side, very good! the cherries were soaked in rum and very strong, ice cream was pecan and very yummy!  The best part was the show that happens outside, its very colorful and very weird, if you site for long enough youll get to see more then one (i think they happen every 20min-30min)  Overall great experience, if you have having a special occasion I suggest you give this place a try.)",

    "text": "Came here after watching the Le Reve show.  we were seated right up in front of the show, primo positioning!  The weather was perfect, the seating was great.     Ambience is very lively.  usually it's very hush-toned in steakhouses, but this place was bustling.   The first waiter that approached us gave us menus, and wandered away.  When he came back, i asked for a drink menu, and he walked away to get it and never came back.  The chain-smokin' draggin' lady behind my wife killed it for us.  She was smoking up a storm.  I get that we're in vegas, and smoking is allowed just about anywhere you're at, but for an upscale steakhouse like this, the entire joint should be non-smoking.   Another waiter saw my wife in distress and came over right away to ask if all was ok.  we got reseated inside in a non-smoking area and were still in view of the waterfall, so that was a good thing.  From then on, we were waited on hand and foot without fail.  Mark and the other waiter were totally awesome.    Food:  i ordered the lamb chops and my wife ordered the chicken breast.  both were cooked perfectly and very delicious.  They have a decent selection of craft beers both in bottle and on tap.    I'd give it 5 stars if it were a completely non-smoking restaurant.  -1 star since for such an upscale restaurant i would expect it to be a little more classy.",

    "text": "Make no mistake, you're paying dearly for the \"SW\" name and atmosphere. I read somewhere that back in the old days when Steve Wynn designed the Bellagio, he regretted having those Fountains out in the public because people wouldn't have to go inside the casino (and be tempted to gamble). He also said he wanted a signature restaurant overlooking the fountains.  Well, when he designed the Wynn, he made sure to get what he wanted. The SW Steakhouse overlooks the Lake of Dreams, which obviously isn't quite as spectacular as the Fountain, but is entertaining in its own quirky and eccentric way. My wife and I sat right on the patio overlooking the lake, and with the sun going down, it was the perfect setting for an anniversary dinner.  We started off with a fantastic bread basket, which included some tasty pretzel rolls. But he cheddar and bacon biscuits were clearly the star. Along with a smear of butter, which had a sprinkle of black Hawaiian sea salt, we had to restrain ourselves before the real food arrived. Here's the breakdown of what we ordered:  - Seafood spectacular: a gorgeous display of chilled seafood, consisting of mussels, clams, jump shrimp, crab spread, King crab legs, and lobster tails. Everything was incredibly tender and flavorful, except for the lobster tails which we saved for the end. It was bland and chewy, and drawn butter probably couldn't even save its life.  - Dry aged tomahawk chop (rib eye): requested medium, this steak had great marbling (almost too much fat), tender, well-seasoned, and had an excellent crust. It came with a small arugula salad directly on top of the steak, which I thought was weird. Apparently, this was the only dry aged steak on the menu, but I didn't quite get that robust, beefy flavor that I was looking for.   I thought about getting the much talked about chili-rubbed rib eye for 2, but I just didn't want the spiciness and seasonings to take away from the flavor of the steak. I also got to sample some of their steak sauces -- they all were okay as a dipping sauce for something else, but I just didn't think they belonged on a good piece of steak.  - Truffle creamed corn: an okay side dish for me, as I didn't taste much of the truffle flavor. I don't really eat much creamed corn, so I kept thinking baby food for some odd reason. That would be the most expensive baby food in the world, that's for sure. Looking back, I probably would've preferred some mashed potatoes or some mushrooms for the sides.  - Peanut butter and banana crunch: a stunning dessert, both in taste and presentation. A beautiful \"Happy Anniversary\" was written on the plate in chocolate. I'm not good at describing dessert, so all I can tell you is that it was rich and decadent, without being overly sweet. The peanut butter and banana flavors are so well-balanced, so if you're a fan of both, check out this dessert.  Overall, this was a good meal -- definitely not cheap, that's for sure. The ambiance isn't one of those quiet, dark, and dimly lit steakhouses. It's more loud, vibrant, and airy -- with the water from the fountain as the background noise. We even got a chance to see the giant mutant frog serenade Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" just as we finished dinner. I heard people plan their trips just to see that frog!",

I spent over $100,000 easily at the Wynn/Encore and I can't request patio dining for my Mom on her 60th birthday?!?!?   There is something very wrong with this picture.....     I was even willing to accommodate any of the 4 days my mom was staying at Encore for her 60th bday, but even that wasn't good enough for the ruthless managers at SW.  I had other family members there visiting Vegas, which would of easily made my bill about $2k+ for dinner.  It's very sad when you try to do a good thing for your Mom, and their is some control freak blocking you from entertaining your family.    Go somewhere else...  Johnathan",

    "text": "We were staying at the Wynn and called for a reservation for Saturday evening.  We called around 4 so weren't sure we could get in.  Were told they had a 5 or 9:30.  Didn't work for us, but when I called back to see about Sunday, the hostess said they were pretty open on Saturday until 7:30.  Not sure why the confusion.   When we arrived at 7, there were at least 5 tables open on the outdoor patio overlooking the water.  We asked to be seated there and were told that they would \"see what they could do\".  Of course, after waiting a half hour (and the seats still being open), we were seated in the back.   Our server was very busy with two large obvious \"business meeting\" tables spending amazing amounts of money on wine and appetizers.  Felt like we were a secondary concern.  He was very helpful and knowledgable when at our table.   SW is as expensive as any of the other \"high end\" restaurants on the strip, maybe higher.  What is much more expensive at the entire Wynn resort is wine.  I don't mind paying more for good wine, but $17 a glass to start.  No bottle under $125.  Was prepared to spend $250 for dinner, but couldn't get a decent bottle of wine with that.   I'm from Nebraska, so am spoiled on beef.  The $58 bone-in ribeye was average.  Its prime beef, but was quite fatty and not seasoned well.  My wife had the salmon which was good.  Sides were all excellent (especially Yukon potatoes).   My advice is to get a filet, make sure you call ahead to get seated by the water, and plan on spending a ton on wine if you love like we do.   Best advice is to be in a big group spending big expense account money.",

    "text": "Before I start this review, a quick disclaimer -- I did not pay for this meal, nor see the bill, so I am focusing purely on the food, service, and ambiance!  It has been a long time since I last experienced an unquestionable 5 star restaurant and SW was just that.  Perfect!  I am not a huge red meat eater, so I was incredibly happy when SW nailed every dish, whether meat or not.  What really makes this place special, is the little extras at every turn.  For starters, we had a wonderful window seat overlooking the water show that they do every 30 minutes, which is both varied and entertaining.  Next, came the breads, of which there were two to choose from and came with butter topped with black sea salt.  We sampled several dishes, including the:  - seafood tower -- VERY tasty and loved the extra horseradish that they brought out - tuna tartar -- this was the most surprising dish of the night, as I was blown away by how well they prepared it for a steak restaurant - crab cakes -- no nonsense here folks, just the crab goodness you want - wagyu beef skewers -- served on a salt stone with mixed veggies, small, but terrific - caesar salad - tomahawk chop -- it was shared and they happily brought it out medium rare and took a few pieces back to the kitchen to serve them medium - lamb chops -- tender, delicious, LOVED the fruit chutney it was served on  As mentioned to start the review, had I paid for the meal, my rating might drop to 4 stars, but probably not.  The service, food quality, ambiance, and little touches made this the second greatest food experience of my life.",

We went here for a bachelor party dinner and all of the guys loved it. We sampled nearly every side dish on the menu and they all get five stars.

We didn't get seated till 7:45 and explained to our server that we needed to be done by 9:15. OK was the response.  We all made our selections quickly so we could order everything at once and our server would not have to come back to our table more than once to take our orders.  DAMN if we didn't sit there munching on bread and drinking wine (some other dude came by and asked if we wanted wine and brought it and served it. HE offered the best service we'd seen and came by three times) till 8:20 before our server came back to take out orders.  Again I told her we had theater tickets and to just bring everything at once, don't stagger anything.  Our entrees showed up at 9:07.  Everyone took a few bites of their steaks or fish and we had to leave. All side dished were nearly untouched.  75% of the meal was left on the table.  When the food was being served I AGAIN told her we had theater tickets and to get the check ready as we had to leave in 5 minutes.  She promptly brought the bill. The ONLY thing she'd done promptly all night.  The one bite of my steak was excellent. For me, the service has to match the food to be five Yelp stars. Side note:  server explained the gratuity was already included for party of 8 when she brought  the bill. No expression of being sorry or concern the we did not eat our meal.",

It was awesome!  Our room had a flat panel tv in there and it was a comfortable environment.  The restaurant also has a beautiful large outdoor patio outside and you can take some cool photos when the lights and images flash on the waterfall.  Our server knew a lot about the cuts and types of steaks they prepared.  The appetizers were delicious and the food didn't take as long to prepare as I thought it would have for our party of 9 people.  The wine was yummy... I went with a Pinot Noir.  I ordered a petite filet and scallops.  It was yummy!  Small portion but it was very filling. I sampled my friend's prime rib and steak.  Both had different tastes and very juicy and tasty.   The best part was the desserts!  I had a chocolate souffle with ice cream and fresh fruit. We also had an almond coconut cake, a peanut butter cake, and sorbets and ice cream samples.  It was all so good I had to sample a bite of it all.  YUM YUM YUM!!! You will love this place!  Make sure you take care of your servers and wait staff... they take excellent care of you here!!!

We even made a last minute change and got a table outside with a great view. The entire staff was great, very friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. They have some great selections in the bread basket so be sure to check those out. Had a shrimp cocktail appetizer which I enjoyed. A friend and I shared the Porterhouse for two instead of each ordering a bone-in rib eye. A good call. I had great mac & cheese at Chef Neil Perry's Rockpool in Melbourne so I decided to give SW's a try. Not as good as Neil's but still a nice side dish and worth the money as it can be shared with multiple people. They have a Vegan page on the menu which is pretty cool for a steakhouse. For dessert I went with the daily special which was Chocolate Souffle: AWESOME. I snapped a few pics for your enjoyment... Definitely go to SW for dinner.",

When we got there for our reservation the host was fairly gruff - I guess he wasn't impressed with us. We were promptly seated but walked past all the empty tables with a view of the lake and were seated in the back corner with NO view of the lake. Not the way I was expecting to start off my hot date night with the wife before Le Reve. On to the food. Wife had the ribeye well done. I ordered the NY strip with bacon shallops. Also had a side of potatoes au gratin. Unfortunately they forgot the bacon shallots and mixed up our orders, so the strip came well done and the ribeye medium. We switched which was alright but you wouldn't expect that from this level of restaurant. The potatoes were delicious and the bacon shallots were pretty good too.  So I would say the food here is a solid 4 stars. I was going to give it a lower overall rating but our waitress was very nice and did comp the meal due to their mistake.  Seemed like the staff was a little snooty which is somewhat expected at a nice place like this but it's not like I showed up in sweatpants...",

    "text": "I try not to write these negative reviews, however today, making an exception.  I have been coming to this steakhouse for over 3 years proclaiming it one of my favorite steak joints on the strip from feasting with friends to client dinners.  I ate at plenty of steakhouses and know there are many good ones on and off strip.  I travel to Texas 1-2 a month and have a decent palate for good beef.  Within this timeframe, I probably spent over $12K with SW, which isn't pocket change when it is from my own wallet and it is not comped.  :(  For this dinner engagement, we were celebrating my finance's recent promotion and our post private engagement dinner.  During the reservation process, I made a couple of special requests.  Dining inside and a romantic spot if they had availability.  They did not come through on either, which the later, I wasn't expecting much when sitting indoors at this establishment.  When we check in, they tried to sit us outside?!  It is 114 degree's and reaching record highs!  We asked the floor manager our preference was to sit inside and that I specifically asked to be sat indoors due to the torturous heat.  Instead of informing us they would look for availability, the floor manager became difficult and tried to convince us to eat outside.  We finally said, no thank you, please sit us indoors.  What surprised us is that he became very rude.  I wasn't expecting that?!  Even his congratulatory comment to us was basically sarcastic and unprofessional.  My finance was shocked because she didn't expect that type of comment or service at the Wynn.  I was ready to say a few unpleasant words and then leave the place.  Instead, my better half said, let's just forget about it and enjoy this day.  When expecting to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars at a restaurant like the SW, you would expect great Service from beginning to end.  Seriously, the floor manager needs to be re-train to be considerate to customers and not dictate things to people.  People show up to your restaurant to experience a wonderful dining opportunity.  On the positive, the dinner started to get better when the waiter started to serve us.  He was very helpful and provided A+ service.  We were served a bad porterhouse which was very stringy and difficult to eat.  It happens, so they corrected it and gave us a complimentary bone in rib eye to replace it.  The truffle (something?) was yum, as well as the grilled onions. The filet was very juicy and delicious.  I would say, SW prepares some of the better ones.  Nice and juicy for this cut.  The wine pairing was ok, but that's what happens when you move from NY to rib eye.  All in all, we had a decent dinner and left full.  :/",

The dining room was elegant and had a view of a pond with a light show and the service was world class.   Steve Wynn really out did himself this time. The food was among the best I've had anywhere. To start the bacon and cheese biscuits were to die for, the sides were all outstanding and my steak..oh my god my steak was an orgasm for my mouth. My Meal was prepared exactly to my requests and exceeded my expectations. I just can't say enough good things about my experience here. My girlfriend and I were both wooed.   This is definitely a special occasion place but with this kind of food I'll be flying to Vegas a lot more for special occasion meals.   If your looking for THE BEST steakhouse in Vegas this is it. There are some good ones out there too but for my money SW takes the prize.",

    "text": "We came to SW Steakhouse on a Wednesday night with a group of 10 for a friends birthday. I was surprised at how busy the place was for a Wednesday night.   I love how the restaurant is open to the outside and you can see the show on the water... until you start having conversations and a big table of 10 in a rather noisy restaurant competing with the show. It got old real fast.   We ordered a few bottles of wine and a plethora of appetizers. I wasn't \"running the show\" so I can't speak of their wine selection but from what I drank, I was impressed.   Appetizers:  Grilled Shrimp  Kobe Beef Carpaccio  giant seafood sampler with oysters, lobster...  some kind of Beet Salad  all delish   I had the Steve's Chopped Salad which was quite large and very good.   At the advice of our dinner host/birthday boy. My husband had the Rib-Eye. I had the Ahi Tuna. I asked for rare and it came out more like medium rare, so that was kind of a disappointment. But the rib-eye, ahhhh, like heaven. The spice rub/crust was amazing. Melt in your mouth.   We had quite a few bottles of wine and were in such good company with conversation going on so I can honestly say I didn't pay much attention to the staff or the service. That leads me to believe that all was well, because only bad service is really noticeable. Good service should blend right in!   For desert my husband and I shared the cheesecake. Excellent choice. I was jealous of the people who ordered the funnel cake. That looked amazing and they were quite satisfied. Next time, I'll try the funnel cake for sure.   Overall a great dining experience. Lost a star because my tuna was overcooked. Quite pricey, but can be expected from a fine dining establishment at the Wynn.",

If the weather's good be sure to sit outside to enjoy the trippy little \"show\" they do every half hour or so.  Steaks were supurb (had an ancho chili rubbed bone in ribeye) and the sides were fantastic.  Did the scallops as an app as well and they were stellar.  Very good overall.",

I was hoping to introduce my entire family to an amazing restaurant to share my 50th birthday. I'm not someone who would normally even take the time to write a review, however our experience this evening was so awful that I feel inclined to let others know not to expect too much, even if you have been a customer here for several years.  There are so many other options in Las Vegas, I suggest you try them.  The service was so poor I can't believe these are professional waiters.  After eating at Carbone the night before, with the most amazing food and service I can't imagine why I would come back here.  So very disappointing and disgusted!!! I would try one of the hundreds of other steakhouses that would blow this one away!!! You have lost me and my family as  customers forever!!",

    "text": "Friday 8:30p.m reservation was right on time with a table ready and waiting for us.  Our party of 6 dined at the outdoor terrace that overlooks the Lake of Dreams.   The outdoor heaters kept us perfectly warm in January.  There are a few different water shows that play periodically in the lake which is a bonus to sitting outside if you are looking for an entertaining dining experience.   Some of the shows are odd but still entertaining.  Ambiance outside is great and I would never sit inside here.  I wasn't very hungry so I ordered 2 starters and no entree.  I love beet salad and order it whenever I see it on a menu.  The beet salad here was small and not something that I would ever ordered again at SW.  Most of the beets were grated on the plate with only a few small chunks of red and yellow beets on top w/ hardly any greens.  I also ordered the Steak Tartare.  They put the steak pieces in a metal ring and only usually sear the steak in the top of the ring.  I requested that they sear the top and bottom so it wasn't totally raw on the bottom. It came out cooked just like I had wanted. It included 4 pieces of toasted bread, Worcestershire Dijon Aioli,  crumbled hard boiled egg, with chives. Excellent flavor and very filling for being a starter.  I had a few of my friends steak fries that were phenomenal and seemed to keep their heat for a while. I am sure we can all agree that really hot french fries are the best!    Dessert:  Funnel cake was excellent.  It came with about 6 cakes on a metal tree. It was served with some strawberries and a trio of chocolate and carmel dipping sauces. 5/5 --a must try.  They do offer quite a few vegan options if that is something that you are looking for.  The negatives:  The table that was right next to us had 3 or 4 people smoking and the smoke wafted our way which is always unpleasant.   Smoking shouldn't be allowed at SW even if you are outside--Yuck! We had to look for our waiter to order more drinks which is really annoying.  They didn't keep the iced teas full and I sat with an empty glass for quite a while before I had to request a new tea because they were oblivious.  My friends requested the wine list but they took so long coming back to see what they selected that they changed their minds because it was getting late and most were working early the next day.  A \"fine dining\" steakhouse like SW should give exceptional service for the prices you are paying and should absolutely NOT allow smoking. Don't just drop the food off and vanish.  You shouldn't have to hunt the waiter down for drinks especially when they have multiple servers looking after your table.    Hidden Restrooms: You either have to know where they are located or ask someone where they are???  They are hidden behind the large back wall area of the bar.  There isn't a sign indicating restrooms are behind the wall and it looks like an area for staff only.  The ladies room has frosted glass doors that had smudges and fingerprints all over the doors giving it a grungy feeling.",

    "text": "Had a reservation and were promptly seated.  Waiter took drink orders and came back quickly.  Told him we needed a little while to study the menu.  After they kind of forgot about us, we finally got our order taken.    Had a great time with the shrimp cocktail!!!  Some of my guests at the table did not know what real horse radish looks like (they wrapped the shrimp for the shrimp cocktail around it - see my photos).  So if you're one step ahead of the pack, ask everyone to take a good bite of the stick and then have them tell you what it is..........by that time, they'll know what it is.  Hahahaha......nice game to pass the time.  I have to say, quality of the meat was very good.  We had 4 x the club chop which was very well cooked.  Well seasoned and slightly gristled on the outside and pink inside as we wanted it.    Do order the truffled creamed corn as it is fantastic, as was the potato gratin.  We ordered a nice Italian bottle of wine, rather inexpensive compared to what was on the menu.  When we ordered the second bottle, which took forever to get, they came out with a 2007, we had been drinking a 2006.  As it took so long and was handled poorly, we declined the second the bottle.  Next time, just be up front with the guest, or mention that THIS is the last bottle.  We'd understand.  Don't try and sneak a fast one.  That's not appreciated.  Overall, I'd return.  Get a table facing the window with the show outside.  In between the show, the real thing to watch are the gold diggers pretending that they know what they are eating and trying to look thin.  I mean we saw one bimbo sitting at a table with her GF sitting next to a \"john\" and she was texting someone the entire time and trying not to be noticed doing so.  It was hilarious.  It's great to people watch when the show's not going on.  Enjoy it, its a good time.",

When we got there just on time for our dinner reservations, we were seated promptly, and even asked if we could sit in the patio so we could watch the little show that they show starting from 7:30. My boyfriend and I expected so much from that show based on the yelp reviews, but honestly it's not that big of a deal. The show consisted of barely two minutes of a giant frog singing a song. It was enjoyable to watch however we waited for two hours just to watch this show since we both were curious about it. Other than the show, everything was perfect, the view from the patio is very pretty, the weather made it even more phenomenal, and the food was delicious. We ordered the crab cake, my bf got the bone in rib eye and a side of fries, which in my opinion was not worth $12.00, tastes the same as five guys. I ordered the Bone in New York which the server recommended to get in rare and I'm so glad I did! With a side of the cream corn which is a must try if you're planning on dining here! Soooo delicious! This place is pretty pricy but worth giving a try once the occasion is right! Definitely not a regular place to eat since it is expensive.",

So they take full advantage of marking everything up quite well. The portions are fairly small except for the steaks. They're pretty large and rich. I got the halibut ($38). It was good but a little dry. I tried my friend's steak and it was quite tasty.  The sides are good but small ($12 each). The potatoes, creamed spinach, sauteed mushrooms and peppers were the best.  The wine list is HUGE. Be sure to bring your gold bars for the $60,000 bottles. And there are more expensive ones than this one.  I don't plan on going back. I went for a bachelor party. There were 14 of us and we each paid $130 at the end. I'm sure there are good steakhouses in the area that are a little easier on the wallet and still give you good value and quality.  Get the chocolate souffle. It's very good.  Be aware that the prices may be higher on some items than what is shown on their website.",

We started with the lump crab cake and it melted in our mouth .... The bread basket has some enjoyable treats - pre meal.....  I dined on the New York strip and it could not have been cooked better - just excellent.  I asked for some steak sauce and was presented with a small platter of three outstanding choices -  a signature chipotle BBQ sauce, hollandaise and a spicey mango sauce. We also had rack of lamb and scallops, again cooked to perfection....... A supurb bottle of wine accented the meal. A real christmas treat.  Try not to miss thiswonderful dining spot with the beauriful views. We viewed two fo the water shows during our meal.  You will not regret your choice of eating at SW.",

The fact that I enjoyed my ribeye, cooked to perfection knowing that I had to pay for it even though I could have gotten it for free from a job recruitment dinner says alot (people always know that food tastes better free).  Still enjoyed the meal even though I lost at credit card roulette and payed half the meal with a friend for 7 people with drinks says even more.  Must try is the bacon bread included free in the bread basket.  Sick.  Probably helped out that I won enough money at the tables prior to the meal to buffer the hit a little :)",

    "text": "We came here for my Birthday. In short it's a great steakhouse. Great food and a fun atmosphere. Its not as elegant as the Prime steakhouse in Bellagio. But the food is very decent.  It was a Friday night. And it was a packed house. We had 7:30 reservations and waited 15 minutes to be seated. The crowd was a mix of old school well to do and dome really sleazy looking guys dressed in Jersey Shore style tight Ed Hardy like t-shirts even though they clearly tell you a  few times button down dressed shirts are required. That was odd for me. I felt that took away from their integrity.  What's the point of having a rule if you won't enforce it. then just take if off the front door sign.  We had the bone-in rib eye and the lamp chops. The rib eye was good. A bit too tough for my taste even though I had it medium. The lamp chops were probably the best I've ever had. The literary melted off the bone. The steak sauces were uninspired.  Trendy yes, but tasty no.. kind of disappointing.  The desert was ok. We had the banana bread pudding.  Tip: they allow you to bring your own cake from the hotel Bakery which is amazing. I would definitely do that next time over ordering from  their desert menu.  We had the spinach dip as a side dish and it was OK. I've had better ones at the Cheesecake factory.  The bread was ok. I was hoping / expecting for much more.   In general everything here is fine. It's  a great restaurant well thought out with great meats and ingredients. But I was hoping for much more. I was hoping to be a convert, and that did not happen  The service was confusing. They have two guys tend to you. One for all your drink needs. And one for your food and desert. Even with that we waited 20 minutes to get our order taken. But to be fair the food was  brought to our table within 10 minutes of the order,  which tells me they have very impressive kitchen.  The bill was $250 for an appetizer,  two main courses, desert, and a glass of wine. Nothing here blew me away. But it's good all around.  Where an amazing night out dining gets a 5 start rating. This place gets  4 stars. As they concentrate on volume. It's a Volume joint and attention is not given to detail. The personal touch is not here. For that you'll go to the Prime at the Bellagio.",

    "text": "What an enchanting dining establishment. Our reservation was for shortly after the restaurant opened, so for a short time we were one of just a few other patrons. I will say that not having any background noise from other patrons made the music stand out, and what was playing didn't seem to fit the vibe of the room. Pop and top 40 really isn't what any of us were expecting and we commented on it throughout our meal.  The servers were polite and informative. It was also a treat to have the ladies served first. It's been quite some time since I've seen a server pass over the male patron to serve the female first. Old-fashioned I know, but I still enjoyed it.   I have to say the filet mignon was perfection. I enjoy mine medium rare and with a thick cut of meat, getting the middle of it done just right can be tricky. My cut was done exactly as I like it, and the flavoring of the meat was fantastic. I also have to gush about the truffle cream corn. It was so good I almost wanted to take a bath in it.   We also had the treat of them opening up the shades and doors to the outside seating area part way through out meal. Initially it was too warm out to have done so, but as the evening set in and the sun eased off they threw open the doors to the terrace and let in the sweet desert air.   I will say the attire of several other diners surprised me. Flannel and jeans...really? Couldn't even be bothered to put on a pair of slacks, huh? Listen up, if I can be bothered to put on a damn dress, the least you can do is find a damn tie.   Overall, I enjoyed SW and would recommend it to friends, but the should really enforce a certain level of attire and think about changing up the music.",

Impressive entry down a circular escalator ( how is the possible?) in a brightly lit lobby with \"dancing lighting \"   Three of us went for a Business dinner, but of course my business did not pay because if we did we'd be bankrupt.   Pricey, very pricey. We shared the chateaubriand and bone in ribeye medium rare.  Cooked perfectly medium rare and both obviously perfect cuts of beef. We had the seafood tower as an appetizer it was loaded with goodness.   We sat near the outside on a wonderful night and I really enjoyed the little electronic light and music shows that went on from time to time. I did not know about this feature. It was very creative.   Food all was wonderful and enjoyed bay all. Our waiter was attentive and staff was courteous for the most part ( stepping aside when you walked by and many thank you's and may I's )   As expected the bill for 3 with wine was 600 dollars plus tip.

    "text": "My husband and I booked a trip to Vegas from April 4, 2018 thru April 8, 2018 for a friend's birthday celebration. We stayed at the Encore - we love the Encore....one of our favorites! We had reservations for SW Steakhouse at the Wynn on April 5, 2018 at 5:30 PM. There were 5 of us in the party - one guest, Anthony, arrived after we had already ordered - a friend of the birthday girl - my husband and I just met him at dinner for the first time.  First, I'd like to say, the service was impeccable, the setting was perfect with the waterfall just outside the restaurant and the food was amazing, until...  ...the next morning, my husband woke up nauseated, needing to vomit. I purchased Pepto Bismol from Sundries in the lobby at Encore. This did not help, it just prolonged the inevitable. Just a bit later, he was hunched over the toilet vomiting meat from the evening before - Japanese Wagyu - Kobe, Hyogo Perfecture Rib Eye $220 4 oz + $55/additional ounce - my husband had 6 oz cooked medium rare.  I tried to convince him to go to an Urgent Care but he didn't feel well enough to get dressed and into a cab.  He was unable to eat much at all for 3 days and by the 4th day, he almost felt normal again - of course this was the day we were heading home.  I contacted the SW Steakhouse on Saturday evening, April 7, 2018 by phone and asked to speak with the Manager regarding food poisoning. I was told he was very busy since it was a peak time in the evening - which I understand though they don't open until the evening so there are no other options of times to call - regardless; the hostess assured me the Manager would call me back shortly.  About  1/2 hour later, I receive a phone call from Security asking me if I had lost an item in the hotel or at a restaurant ??? Though I \"now\" understand this is the process for SW Steakhouse and the Wynn with regards to food poisoning - the gentlemen had no idea why he was contacting me. I explained I expected a call back from the SW Steakhouse Manager and since I was told I would receive a call from him, could he please call me back. Security then had the SW Steakhouse Manager call back.  At this point, I was pretty fed up with the treatment I was receiving and handed the phone to my husband. My husband explained the situation to the Manager. After he was off the phone, my husband told me the Manager was very polite and empathetic though we had to go through Risk Management/Security to file a claim for the food poisoning. We were told Risk Management/Security would contact us at 10:00 am the next morning - no one called.  We returned home that Sunday evening, April 8, 2018 and received a phone call around 9:00 pm from Risk Management/Security.  Maybe the Manager meant to say 10:00 pm???  My husband explained the details to Risk Management/Security, to include; *I had ordered the same dish and had an upset stomach for the whole next day and a lot of acid reflux - I ordered my Rib Eye - medium well. *Anthony, the friend of the birthday girl, we had learned from the birthday girl was also vomiting and sick for the remainder of the trip - he stayed in his room for 3 days as well - he ordered the same Rib Eye - rare  A few days later I received a phone call from Risk Management/Security stating they \"investigated\" the restaurant, the food prep process, the clean up and questioned all the employees to ensure they knew the process for prepping/handling food properly which is how the health department would inspect the premises.  I was also told, no one was sick 48 hours prior to our meal and no one was sick 48 hours after our meal.  She questioned the validity of our sicknesses though in the same sentence hoped we all felt better.  I was told due to their findings, our sicknesses were not food poisoning and they were not responsible.  I was baffled by the explanation of their investigation - I honestly thought they had a way of finding out what made 3 of us sick when I was told they would investigate.   I DON'T CARE IF NO OTHER GUESTS WERE SICK - MY HUSBAND WAS VIOLENTLY SICK!!!   I was asked if we had sought medical help.  I've now learned by reading online reviews from others who did seek medical help; this would not have changed their findings. All that have claims of food poisoning from the Wynn received the same result/treatment we did.   We honestly didn't expect a refund even though we were unable to attend any of the Birthday Girl's events planned for the next 2 days (we were told Anthony did not attend these events either) and it ruined out trip but to insinuate we were lying is very offensive.   My husband and I travel a lot.  We visit Las Vegas about 3-4 times a year and love the Encore/Wynn...well, \"loved\" it. We had planned to make many more trips there in future.  We will definitely let all our friends know about the food poisoning and treatment we received. We will not visit the Wynn/Encore again.",

I'm slowly converting to this beef variant, and the NY cut is good since it's marbleized so it's tender and tasty, more so than a standard Rib Eye or Fillet Mignon.  Here, there's an $80 priced 10 oz steak which is perfect.  I've had Wagyu at Wolfgang Puck's \"Cut\" as well as \"Flemming's\" and this is on par to perfection.  If you've never had Wagyu, it's worth trying.  I've had traditional Kobe Beef which is more oily rich and a bit too decadent for my palete at times in comparison 'tho really good, much more expensive, so for taste and value, I'd always go with the Wagyu over Kobe.  The service was friendly and fast.  I also had the King Crab Soup which was zesty and tasty 'tho not a lot of crab in it, it was delicious.",

The hosts were very welcoming unlike other steakhouses where they are just straight rude. My servers kept my water full at all times. He must have asked if I needed anything at least 5 times. My servers assistant even asked if they could serve/plate my food for me. Thank you so very much for asking!   Food.  We had a party of two. So we got an appetizer and two entrees. For our appetizer we got the crab cakes to share. It was basically one crab cake per person. I am a very huge fan of crab cakes and I was again very impressed with the SW's cakes. For our entrees we got the 40oz Porter House and the sea scallops. The meat was delicious, however the meat wasnt as tender as some of the other steakhouses around. STILL DELICIOUS THOUGH! The sea scallops were a different story. It was just ehh, nothing spectacular at all. 4 scallops with a little bit of risotto. The risotto was nothing but salt. For our side we ordered jumbo size asparagus . Very delicious. I would seriously recommend it.   Price.  Not bad at all. Party of two came out to $130 a person. Honestly it was a perfect night.   Dining.  We sat outside and had a view of the waterfall. They have a show like every thirty minutes. It was beautiful.   Check the pictures.",

Unfortunately we cannot afford that on a regular basis, it is definitely expensive. The filet was great. The sides were decent. I would say mustard greens in general is not the tastiest vegetable but I had a need to eat something green. The desserts were GREAT.  Service was amazing. We never had to wait for anything or flag down anyone. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable.",

Very nice restaurant and has a beautiful outside area with a waterfall wall and show every 15 minutes.   We all ordered different steaks and shared: truffled cream corn, mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and foie gras.  Everything came out perfectly, steaks were cooked nicely, some sides were better than others and the service was superb.   If I were to come back again I would get the rib eye, and truffled cream corn. Brussel sprouts I thought weren't too bad but didn't really like the bacon too much with it. Foie gras was okay as well but then again I can't eat too much of it and mashed potatoes were good but not the best I've had. Make sure to try the bacon and cheese bread they give you in your bread basket when it comes out cause it taste the best when it's warm with the butter melted on it. Also has the Hennessy car bomb with a sugar tin which was pretty good and would order again.",

    "text": "Good bye to the ratchet Vegas days of drinking all day and night and MAYBE having a cup of noodle the entire weekend and HELLO SW STEAKHOUSE!  Restaurant located in the Wynn so that alone should scream top-notch. Upscale and upbeat. I arrived slightly buzzed and a little after our reservation, but they were able to seat us right away. We were indoors, but our table faced the lake/waterfall. Every half hour or so they put on a little show... It was cute. and somewhat entertaining (not really).   + 20 oz. bone-in rib eye - Again, slightly buzzed so I let my boyfriend order me a 20oz. bone-in rib eye. Otherwise I would've stopped him because omg that's just way too much food. I think he was plotting though because he had plenty of my steak left over lol. Anyway, I barely finished a quarter of it, but my oh my. JUICY, FLAVORFUL, MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH, HEAVENLY, etc. etc. etc.  + sides - mushroom, cream corn ... staple steak sides that were really good. BUT if you have to choose at least one... get the jalapeno/onion/pepper dish. SOOOO amazing (if you like spicy food). My boyfriend and I loved it so much we went home that weekend and cooked steak just to eat it with our sorry version of that side. SO GOOD.  + foie gras - I've had way better. I would've been happier without it.  Great experience, but still not my favorite steakhouse ever.",

We had the chilli-rubbed steak to share, the mac & cheese and potatoes and everything was perfectly delicious. This is by far the best steakhouse we've tried in Vegas. My only disappointment was the check in. We had called the day before for reservations and unfortunately couldn't get a table by the water, but the hostess could have been a lot more polite about it. Please have people with customer service skills in the front. Initially, her service ruined the expectations I had for this place, but the rest of the service we received from the staff was exceptional. We were very happy with everything else. We will be coming back, next time we will make sure we make reservations with plenty of time so we don't have any issues.",

This is the best steakhouse I've been to so far! Had steaks at many other places, but nothing compares to the high grade quality Kobe beef and cooked perfectly medium rare! Had a very interesting display for desserts.   The service is superb! They have a great view when they open up the restaurant during the evening and the weather is nice outside right in front of a waterfall!   Overall, nice ambience and view. Steaks and sides compliment each well! But one thing, be ready to pay a hefty bill, but it's totally worth the experience!!",

If like great service and ambience, this the place.  Steak are excellent as usual. Later in the evening, the lake has a show usually every 30 minutes.   Must get the hash brown pie for side dish.

I made reservations online a few weeks before our visit and we were seated right away when we arrived. All the waiters were very courteous and attentive. We enjoyed: Bread basket: 5/5 the three complimentary types of breads were fresh and warm. Pretzel was my fav. Pink sangria: 4/5 pretty tasty! Lychee martini: 3/5 this was ok, kinda sweet Tomato salad: 5/5 light and refreshing Cowboy ribeye: 5/5 cooked to perfection. I was able to finish about 3/4 of it. Our waiter said he was impressed. Potato au gratin: 3/5 not what I remember it to be. Texture and flavor was very average. I would skip this. Anniversary truffles: 5/5 these complimentary truffles were absolutely delicious. The white ones were amazing!  Service and steak were top notch. Definitely recommend this place if you need a steak fix.",

    "text": "SW is located downstairs of the Wynn's north entrance. It's a fairly large restaurant and the hostess asks if you have a preference to sit inside or out on the patio. I chose to sit outside which was very calming and relaxing overlooking the water. Although the temperature was was over 100 it was not hot at all.  I was leaning towards ordering the Kobe because I didn't feel like having a large steak. Corey our waiter recommended the Ohmi instead. I'm glad I followed his advise because the texture was different from wagyu that I've had from Kobe or Kagoshima. I really enjoyed it. For sides I had the Black Truffle Creamed Corn (which I highly recommend) and Asparagus.  There were two waiters assigned to a table and service was impeccable. Corey did an excellent job explaining the menu and checking up to see how things were.  SW is definitely a high end restaurant you want to go to if you are celebrating something special. If you are a romantic, ask for patio seating. Will I return? You bet!",

    "text": "SW Steakhouse is a unique steakhouse because of the beefs they offer that are not available elsewhere in USA, i.e, the Kobe beef. Only three places in the USA have permission to import and serve Kobe beef. For YELPers who are not familiar with Kobe beef, do not mistake this for \"Kobe-style\" beef or \"kobe\" or any similar misleading claims/terms at restaurants. True Kobe beef is from Japan and the cattle are literally hand-massaged and feed beer and pampered to death to produce a meat that is unrivaled in quality and flavor. My brother and I chose the \"cheap\" Kobe which was 180 dollars for a four-ounce portion but my brother chose an additional two ounces at an extra forty-five dollars per ounce. I got the King Krab Oscar add-on and requested it on the side as not to interfere with the Kobe. The four-ounces was perfectly adequate amount due to its richness and flavor punch. It has a flavor profile all its own and doesn't remotely resemble any steak or meat you have experienced. Forget your dry-aged hand-rubbed Capitol Grille-type stuff -there is no comparison. Kobe is very rich and, needless to say, tender and the fat is evenly marbled and melted throughout to provide a highly distinct strong gamey taste and a supreme edibility. The Kobe was served with an Oriental-type sauce for dipping but I recommend eating the Kobe straight up or \"neat\" just as you would want to appreciate your Louis XIII Cognac straight up or neat as opposed to making an Incredible Hulk Cocktail using Louis XIII Cognac mixed with Hypnotic. The Oscar was a generous portion at 28 dollars and had asparagus and a hollandaise-type sauce. Moey got a steak which was an 8-ounce grass-fed organic USA steak for 62 bucks with a Maine lobster tail for additional 40 bucks which was a good size tail. Hers was very good and would satisfy any steak connoisseur. All steaks came with excellent veggies and sundries and were garnished with H2O 'cress. The service was great and it was reasonably quiet as it was devoid of families and toddlers. Our octopus app was tasty and tender (for an octopus) and had a slick presentation and ausum sauce. I would recommend SW highly. Please do spend the extra $$$ and get the Kobe beef and you'll see what the hype is all about. See you in Vegas, YELPers! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$",

Restaurant is definitely super gorgeous and very upscale....like no jeans even dark jeans kinda upscale. Came in for dinner on a Monday and place was pretty pack inside, but lots of seating in the patio....sheesh I wonder why? Maybe the sweltering heat had something to do with it. Lol Make reservations ahead just in case. The bar area is super cute and sleek so grab a drink if you have to wait for a table. Hostess was friendly and sat us down right away since I had reservations.   We sat in the patio just cause it was less crowded, but it was definitely hot even at 7pm. It just felt more romantic sitting in the patio facing the water so if on a dinner date and weather ain't scolding do patio. Our waitress and waiter was fabulous!!! It seems each table is assigned to two waiters or maybe just the patio area hmmmm anyways let me tell you it was fabulous though! You don't ever really have to wait for anything except for your meals. Seriously, service was impeccable!!! Our drinks came out fast and I mean many many drinks, we were checked on regularly, our water cups were never empty. Oh, bread basket was the shitzzzz, pardon my language, but the pretzel bread with their butter....hallelujah! Beyond delicious!!!   We order octopus for appetizer, scallops, and wagyu steak for our entrees. Octopus was delicious just the right amount of seasoning and smoky chard. It was super soft and can be cut with a butter knife. Scallop was super tender and seasoned to perfection! It sat on top of this creamy pea risotto and presentation was just gorgeous! It was a good size portion and will definitely fill you up. The wagyu steak was seriously like butter and cooked to perfectly! Our only side we order was the mushrooms. Everything was so rich and decadent taking your time to eat is a must! For dessert we order the rocky road. Yesssss that is a must! We spent close to four hours dinning/drinking and not once did we ever felt rushed. Staffs were just amazzzing and super professional. It was a bonus as well getting to watch the water shows while dinning. From the beginning entrance to the end of our drinks/meal SW deserves a standing ovation!",

Checking up on you continuously and making sure all the dishes are to your liking. 1 of 5 restaurants in the US that has 100% Kobe beef is a distinction in it self but the price is a whopping $260 for 4 oz and you have to order minimum of 4 oz. I settled for their American wagyu from Snake River Farms 10 oz NY Strip which was excellent. The marbling was just right in very bite all throughout the meat which I highly recommend. Desert i chose was their rocky road (boujee version) it was unforgettable to say the least. Not too overly sweet and was a great finish to an excellent 4 hr dinner. Forgot to mention the scallops, mushroom and charred octopus that was also great. My steal was that good",

It was an excellent idea as we arrived close to 6:00 p.m. and simply had a fantastic time in this ultra clean and very pleasant environments. You can sit inside or outside but you better be warned it's like a 109 here in Las Vegas and sitting outside you gonna be really hot. I had a 16 oz New York strip and it was simply amazing. The big portion is good to cause you eating like as if you had a buffet. We had some potatoes and mushrooms for sides as well and that was great.   We have been drinking all day so this talk to text thing is really good and some of you might actually ask why am I writing reviews at this hour? It's for you!

    "text": "REVIEW ON KOBE BEEF: SW Steakhouse is one of 9 restaurants in the United States (and one of 3 restaurants in Las Vegas) that serves certified Kobe beef. I knew I wanted to splurge during my vacation to Vegas and treat myself to some real Kobe beef. I choose SW Steakhouse over the other two restaurants that served it because: (1) SW had better reviews than the other 2 restaurants, (2) from looking at the photos on Yelp the presentation of Kobe at SW was much better, and (3) it wasn't the most expensive option price/oz wise and it wasn't the least expensive option. In hindsight I am really glad I chose to get Kobe at SW. I was incredibly impressed; the steak was cooked to perfection and the meat was incredibly juicy and mouthwatering. (I'm getting hungry and craving Kobe just writing this review.)  REVIEW ON EVERYTHING ELSE: The ambiance at SW Steakhouse is great. We were lucky and got seated right by the waterfall/pool. (The waterfall/pool has a light show with a giant frog that was a little weird but also pretty cool and entertaining.) The service at SW Steakhouse is top notch. I thought the food (that wasn't the Kobe beef) was good, fairly standard for an expensive steakhouse, but nothing to write home about.",

We had Fernando as our waiter my friend said that her and her hubby came here for her birthday and that Fernando was wonderful! Well he absolutely was! He suggested a nice wine for my friend to have with her steak. She ordered the peppercorn crusted 9 inch filet. She also ordered the fennel mac and cheese and we shared a chopped salad. Due to my food allergies I was told that I couldn't have the vegan meatballs. I was really looking forward to having them. Apparently they have red onion in them. I chose to order the ravioli instead. The ravioli had a weird taste. They were topped with olives and peas, sun dried tomatoes and had a lemony sauce. The flavors just didn't mesh well for me. I tried the mac and cheese and wasn't impressed. Loved the chopped salad it was refreshing and a perfect portion size split between the two of us. I saw a basket of fries and they looked delicious so we ordered those. Good thing I did because they were the best fries I've ever had! Nice and crisp and flavored perfectly! Fernando gave us a chocolate molten cake to enjoy. It was phenomenal! Cooked perfectly and the chocolate that poured out of it was to die for! Thank you to Jessica and Fernando for making what started off as a bad experience a memorable one!  The show was great as well it started at 08:30 and a new scene happens every 30 minutes. We got to see 4 different scenes.   Oh, and the bread basket is amazing!!",

We sat at the table facing the waterand it was so soothing and peaceful to have dinner with that view. We were given complimentary bread and butter and ordered the crab cake to start with. I could do without the crab cake next time - there was nothing special about it. Then we ordered the dry aged bone in new york, rib eye, and the jidori chicken. All of it was amazing! The steaks and chicken were cooked to perfection - not one bit dry!",

It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It tasted great.  The tuna tartare was great. Beautiful presentation.   If we come back to Vegas again we will visit this place for sure!",

    "text": "Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #46 - #365  Did you know that, SW are initials for Steve Wynn?  Executive Chef: David Wolzag   That's right! Most of his restaurants are names after famous Chefs who grace most of Steve Wynn's fine dining spots but he wanted to mark his name in one of his restaurants.   Me and my friend were thinking about eating in a nice fancy restaurant after our Le Reve (The Dream) show and decided to eat at SW Steakhouse, plus they had a great view of the lake show. The Steakhouse is located next to Parasol Down, just take the curved escalator down to the Lake of Dreams and it will be located on your left side. We made reservations but still had to wait for a table, I thought was unacceptable, the wait ended being 30 minutes, plus we were a little late so that was a major factor.   The clientele is very classy and mostly an older crowd as Steve Wynn targets for his world renowned resorts. Our server was very friendly and bubbly and made us feel comfortable during our dining experience. He asked us what we would like to drink and we said, \"Ice cold water\" than he started explaining different kinds of water from non carbonated to carbonated, it was just confusing but a fun experience. We were seated right next to the lake show and we enjoyed the view from our table as we ate and drank our $$$$ meal! Sadly, we requested to eat on the patio but they said it's not permitted because of the hot summer weather, which would ruin the ambiance our dining experience.   We ordered:   + Steve's Chopped Salad $17  - Avocado, crisp potatoes, Dijon vinaigrette  +Roasted Skuna Baked Salmon $36  - White asparagus, fava beans, whole grain mustard sauce  +Fillet Mignon 9 ounces  $54 - Aged Nebraska Corn-Fed beef is 100% USDA Prime  We were blown away from the presentation to the taste of the food, this was truly the fine dining experience we were looking for, especially at Wynn.  I will definitely  be back to try more items on the menu and experience the classiness that is of Wynn Resorts.",

    "text": "There are few restaurants in the world I have been to that top my experience at SW Steakhouse. While some of the food was not necessarily to my liking, that is more of a personal preference and not really a reflection of the restaurant itself.  I was in Vegas for work and had a few nights where I was wined and dined by some clients/vendors, and was lucky enough that SW was one of the places we had scheduled to have dinner. At a table for 10, I can safely say I probably managed to have a taste of just about anything on the menu that looked any good on paper.  Let me say first of all that the ambience and service level at the SW is unparalleled by any restaurant I've been to (and not to toot my own horn, but I've been to a lot). The hostess was courteous, and our server Nina was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable and accommodating.  They have a great selection of wine and liquor. We shared a few bottles of cab throughout the meal and I had an amazing glass of Yoichi Japanese whiskey.  On to the good stuff: We started with the Seafood Spectacular, which included oysters on the half shell, king crab legs, lobster, and jumbo shrimp. By far, I'd say that the oysters were the best part. The freshness and flavor were unlike any oysters I've ever had. The jumbo shrimp were also particularly tasty. I personally felt that the crab was a little lacking, but others in my party seemed to really enjoy them. Lobster was also quite good.  For entree, I ordered the bone-in ribeye after reading some of the glowing reviews I'd seen for it on Yelp. I also had some of the creamed corn, creamed spinach, smoked bacon mac and cheese, and sauteed mushrooms.   I ordered my ribeye Rare-plus, which is a sort of middle ground between rare and medium-rare. As a serious steak lover, I am convinced that the flavor and texture of steak is best at this temperature. If you are reading this review and would like to try it though, please please PLEASE only do it at a good steakhouse that knows what it's doing. Anywhere else and you might get sick. Don't say I didn't warn you!  Unfortunately my steak came at what seemed to me more like a medium-rare, almost medium. I hate to do this usually but at a restaurant of this calibre I had to flag down the waitress and send it back. Nina was more than willing to trade it for a rarer one. The replacement they brought out was exactly how I wanted it: rare but warm, almost purple on the inside when you cut it open. I don't say this about food often, but that bone-in ribeye is one of my favorite experiences in the world. My only criticism is that it was a little less seasoned than I would've preferred, but this is not necessarily a bad thing.  I wish I could say such glowing things about the sides. I didn't enjoy the sort of mashed, gritty texture of the creamed corn. Flavor was great, but ultimately it just reminded me of really buttery grits. Creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms were okay but nothing special. I was sorely disappointed by the mac and cheese - I would've rather had Kraft mac and cheese. The flavors they used just didn't work well for me. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy them though, as virtually all of the plates wound up empty at the end of the night.  Either way, I had a very enjoyable time at SW and would happily come back.",

OK the venue is elegant & sumptuous. Sitting outside is essential, next to the Lake Of Dreams & the waterfall. During your dinner you will be treated to a beautiful kaleidoscopic show with multicolored lights, projections and three-dimensional figurines. The setting & decor is money, plain & simple.  There's very few steakhouses that make Mastro's seafood tower & filet mignon look like a total joke. This is definitely one of them. And that should be all you need to know.  If you're in Vegas & you can afford to eat at SW, it's an absolute must. You can thank me later.",

Tips:  1.  Despite the urge to consume the delectable carbs known as the bread basket (pretzel roll is my personal favorite) hold out for the \"main event\".    2. The chile double rubbed ribeye may be the most amazing steak I've ever had in my life (\"Smoke if you got 'em\").  A must try!   3. First time diners are encouraged to book in advance and ask for outdoor seating (weather permitting) or indoor seating with a view of the lake show [begins at 730].    4.  I typically don't stay at the hotel/casino (I'm an M Life points whore) but I highly recommend diners take time before or after dinner to explore the property as it's absolutely amazing (Steve Wynn is a genius and has my lifetime endorsement).    Enjoy!",

Once we had our table out on the lovely terrace that had a very nice mini pool/ pond with a big waterfall and a interesting (to say the least) show that would start every 15mins. The shows were a very smart idea for the restaurant to use, I couldn't tell you how long it took for food to come out cause I didn't even pay attention. Food was delicious, I had a filet with a little of each of the various sides we ordered for our group. Desert came and was truly a great way to top the night off there.

    "text": "We decided to come here because while in Paris we met a nice young man at dinner who was the Wine Director at SW Steakhouse. He gave us his card and told us to stop by when in Vegas. Unfortunately the night we went he was off. Initially when I made reservations I requested seating outside so we could watch the light/water show they have at the Wynn. It was 106 day that day but when we were seated I was very surprised at how cool it was on the patio. It felt like 80.  We started with a couple glasses of Champagne and the Seafood Spectacular. OMG! We were in heaven. There were huge King Crab legs that were already split and ready to eat, a large lobster tail split in half, 8 huge prawns, a crab salad and oysters. It was $85 which actually was a very good deal for such a fancy place. We also split some sauteed Foie Gras which was very rich and buttery. Foie is my favorite. The bread they serve throughout the meal is also amazing.  We decided to order the 42 ounce chili rubbed ribeye. This is meant for two people. By this point we were already very full and struggled just to eat a few pieces of the ribeye. The ribeye was seasoned very well and was spicier than I expected. It was cooked to perfection but unfortunately we couldn't even come close to finishing it. We also ordered lobster gnocchi and french fries as our sides. Both were very good but hardly touched.  Overall we had a great experience at SW. The service was great from start to finish and the food was what you'd expect from a place with Steve Wynn's name on it. The bill was a  little over $400 after tip but is worth the splurge.",

    "text": "After finding out Rosemary's closed it's doors we were on the hunt to quickly find a restaurant to dine at for the weekend in Vegas.  Apparently Robuchon is closed to remodel and L'Atelier was fully booked so we opted for a steakhouse.  Having heard good things of SW, we quickly made reservations.  Arrived a tad bit early to find the restaurant pretty dead with only a few tables being utilized.  SW has an awesome view of a waterfall which you preview while taking the escalator down.  Patrons can be seated in or outside for dining.  Since it was 105, we opted to dine inside.  Have heard so many good things about their chili rubbed ribeye so I knew ahead of time what I'd be ordering.  Quickly ordered a glass of wine and opted for the regular ribeye but w/ the chili rub.  Bread basket  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=iLYHTbVonwM-pGooO9GiXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>).  The bacon and cheese bread was awesome, not as good as Scarpetta's salami and mozzarella but it was very very tasty.  Served with the bread basket is butter seasoned with Hawaiian black and red sea salt (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=UNzDVICa54Dm08njtxOMvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>).    For the side we shared the black truffle creamed corn (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=B5aveYAlN1B7a4OMjVgobA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>).  Not what I was expecting as it was a very sweet side almost tasted dessert like but the black truffles really enhanced the corn.  Bone-in ribeye (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=tlNeFcA82jbTKC-lYEk3HQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>).  Luckily I didn't have to order the double bone-in ribeye inorder to sample SW's famous chili rub (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=kRlnMG-EqrIB8SMTT-Rbxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>).  The steak was cooked perfectly and although I like my meat just sea salt and pepper, the chili rub did live up to the hype.  It added a nice flavor to the steak and wished it was cooked with the sauce instead of being served on the side.  For dessert we ordered the dark chocolate souffle cake (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg?select=v8z1Y4kymU0hTY0_xc0ftw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/L_ZL...</a>).  A great way to end a good meal and the brandied cherries were the highlight of the dessert.  I thought that the souffle cake was more of a molten chocolate cake than a souffle, still was tasty.  Only complaint for the night is that we had little flies buzzing around as they opened up the glass door to the patio and also the fact that it got a little warm inside towards the end of dinner.  Service was awesome and would definitely be back in the future.",

Anyway, as much as I loved this place few years ago. It is no longer the amazing place it was. I would pass on this place and go somewhere else. I dont want to write anymore and sound like a complete meany. So just pass not worth the $$$$.",

    "text": "SW is one of those restaurants where you are blown away by almost everything in the place. The dining room is open, well lit, classy, and clean cut. The food is impeccable. The waitstaff is phenomenal, attentive, and friendly.   The first time I came, I sat in the dining room. It spectacular. I sat with Amanda and Julio. They were both on spot. I did not have to ask for a thing. The second time, a friend and I sat at the bar.   The beef carpaccio is good. The meat is delicious, but the friscee salad elevates the dish. Break off a piece of the cheese crisp and add that to it for the perfect bite. It gives a much needed saltiness to the dish. The beet salad is the appetizer I would go for though. Large cuts of beautiful red and golden beets, tossed in a light vinaigrette, and an aged goat cheese. Delicious. I must have eaten the whole plate by myself. The NY strip is my friend's go to cut. It is charred on the outside and retains all its flavor on the inside. Ask for the chile sauce on the side to dip the steak in. Especially if you go for the cream corn. The balance of fat, spice, and sweetness from all these items are exquisite. The desserts were not my favorite. I had a bite of the key lime cheesecake and didn't get the other components it boasted. At this point, I was stuffed and didn't care for any more.",

    "text": "2 stars are given for the kind, attentive and courteous staff as well as for the atmosphere and to their signature drink called \"The Dream\" which was the only thing I enjoyed in this first time SW experience.  However the remaining 3 stars are lacking mainly because flavor was lacking in everything we ordered for dinner :(   For starters we ordered the Tuscan Kale salad which was nothing impressive and had no hint of Apple.  For main courses, we ordered New York steak and asked for it medium, but when served it was clearly well cooked.  Our server was very quick and accommodating to take it back and oddly enough a medium steak was given within 5 minutes.  So either they mistakenly gave us another table's well done steak or they went ahead and gave us someone else's medium steak since ours was not prepared medium as requested.  It required a lot of side sauce to even enjoy a few small bites from the tasteless steak.  We also ordered their Alaskan Halibut which was very bland and unexpected because the presentation was beautiful but the taste did not mactch, which was very disappointing.  We also ordered sauteed wild mushrooms which were very undercooked and and the Mac and Cheese was extremely bland.  We were both very hungry but didn't even enjoy the food and a lot was left untouched.  The bill was paid, the generous tip given for the kind staff, however we left very disappointed as we had heard great things about this place. We ended up eating pizza shortly after.   Overall, regretted coming here for dinner.",

It is d-e-l-i-c-i--o-u-s. Their crab cakes are also great. Unlike a lot of the crab cakes that are full of mayo, these are mostly crab.  The sides are large enough to share. We've tried the au gratin potatoes, creamed spinach, and Yukon gold potato puree. The were all great!  If you're thinking about going and want a reservation, I would suggest booking it way in advance because the reservations do fill up fast.  You can also walk in and wait to be seated but if you have a tight schedule, I would recommend a reservation.  Can't wait til' we go to Vegas again so that I can get my SW fix.",

    "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Wynn for Memorial Day weekend. We were excited to make reservations at the SW for our final night. She ordered her filet medium and I ordered my bone in ribeye medium rare. I confirmed to the server that I wanted a warm red center. The server was quick to instruct us that because of the lighting in the restaurant the steaks might appear over cooked. I found this odd but thought nothing more about it. When the steaks came out it was obvious that my wife had gotten medium rare and mine was medium. She does not mind a medium rare steak so she ate hers. My ribeye was way over cooked for my tastes. I mentioned it to the server and she apologized and immediately had the kitchen cook another. This steak came out way undercooked. I would have eaten it except the center was cold and I just don't want a cold center in my 92.00 dollar steak. I sent the steak back without hesitation. At this point my wife had finished eating and I was frustrated. The manager came over to apologize. She stated that the chef overcompensated with the second steak and she admitted it was undercooked. Then she told me that the first steak was cooked perfectly. I am not a chef but I do order medium rare steaks often at many less fancy restaurants and never have a problem. I also grill steaks for my family often. The SW is a nice place with beautiful scenery but if you can't cook a steak to temperature after two tries I can not recommend them to other patrons",

The only reservation that was available online a week before was at 9:30pm for 4. However, I called at 8:30pm the day of to ask if we could come early and they said yes! We had to wait about 10 minutes when we got there and there were some nice couches by the bar. They originally wanted to seat us inside but luckily, there was a table available on the patio! There is a really nice fountain overlooking the patio and a bunch of heat lamps so you don't have to worry about the cold. We started with a bottle of wine and the chilled seafood tower. It was delicious and came with shrimp, king crab legs, lobster, oyster, and a cole slaw ceviche. Great to share for the table! We then each ordered a steak: New York, Filet, Rib Eye, and they even have a grass fed one with very little calories for health freaks! Sides cost additional and we got asparagus, mushrooms, and mac & cheese for the table. Everything tasted great but the one complaint is that the outside of the steak was pretty charred, while some parts of the inside were RARE when we ordered medium rare. Maybe that's just their style? The fountain plays a different light/music show every 15-20 minutes or so. The waitress said there's about 15 different ones they rotate through. The service was great and everyone was always checking up on us. They had brought us the baby tabasco bottles for the oysters and my brother and dad thought it was so adorable, they brought us another 5 to take home! Didn't have room for dessert, but we definitely had a great night here!",

We had a nice table right along the railing in front of the waterfall. Theres a dress code but i dont believe its heavily enforced saw a couple guys in tshirts. Everything was super delicious. I think we tried to order almost everything on the menu. Unfortunately my bf had a headache and hated the shows but i thought they were hilarious especially after the wine. So we started with shrimp cocktail and tuna tartare the shrimp were hugeeee! Then i think i got the new york n my bf got filet the only reason i rated 4 stars was because i didnt order the kagoshima wagyu which is my go to favorite! So i cant fully rate without trying that. Side lobster tail bf got the crab i liked his crab better than my lobster it melts in your mouth. We order the potato gratin brussel sprouts asparagus and cream spinach. Definitely order the spinach! Its perfect. Then we shared a banana fostered bread pudding...which my bf scarfed down n barely shared w me! They just combined two of my fav desserts absolute points for that! All in all if youre in vegas definitely check this place out its so delish.  Great food good wine selection great atmosphere.",

    "text": "SW makes me so happy.   The steaks were seasoned and cooked *amazingly* and they give you kobe beef infused butter to melt on top of the it.   The portions are large so you can definitely share a plate with a friend. There were six of us dining and we were all stuffed with just three entrees and three sides.   There seems to be a lot of truffle infused items on their menu. We got the truffled creamed corn. It was delicious but keep in mind that it is not whole kernels of corn it's more of an oatmeal consistency.   There's an extensive wine list offering wine by the glass, half bottles, and full bottles. From what I saw glasses started at $16, half bottles at $80, and full bottles cost more than my hotel room.   I recommend sitting on or near the patio to see the waterfall. If the weather cooperates they will open up the floor to ceiling doors so you get indoor dining with some outdoor feel.   There's a giant mechanical frog that comes out on top of the waterfall....and it sings!! Completely random. I almost choked on my food when I saw it. So creepy.   Other than that, the service is ah-mazing. They even split the checks for us according to what each person ordered.   If you're not staying at the Wynn, there's complimentary valet for those driving. Go early and take pictures with the elaborate foliage at the entrance of the hotel!",

The courteous gestures, such as providing a complimentary soup taste, and no request denied made this an effortless dining experience. The steaks were prepared perfectly and the sides were generous portions. We did experience a lengthier wait for our table as the patio was closed due to the weather. But the hostess did ensure we had our prefer seating and was not bothered when we would inquire about the wait.",

I love this restaurant and it is my go to spot in Vegas",

The steak was very juicy and seasoned just right. The Mac and cheese was creamy and tasted delicious. I like the variety of breads they offered. The pretzel bread and cheesy bread muffin were really good. The service was great feeling your water every few minutes. The waiter kind of disappeared towards the end so service wise I would rate it only four stars but overall a five-star experience.",

    "text": "So this review is a bit late but I just recently started using yelp to actually post reviews so I figured why not post a review about this restaurant now. I visited Vegas in June with my bf and a couple of friends. My bf and I wanted to have a romantic evening at a real steakhouse in Vegas on our last night and we chose SW located in the Wynn hotel.   This place is a great place for a romantic outing. I suggest getting a seat outside if possible we weren't able to since it is a higher demand and we would have had to wait longer and I was starving. Our server(s) were very attentive, and polite. To start we got the kale salad, which was huge and very tasty. We also split the 16 oz steak, which would have been too much steak for us to eat alone and for a side we got the au gratin potatoes, which were delicious and left us wanting more. The steak was a bit more red than I prefer but it was absolutely delicious so I didn't complain. We were too full to try in dessert. All in all it was a very nice dining experience and I would consider visiting again if I'm ever in Vegas.",

    "text": "Sw steakhouse has been on my watchlist for restaurants to visit. At first I though it's a normal steak house, until I read that it had Kobe beef. Kobe beef is a beef from japan. It's made from Kobe cattle and is very good. The cattle are pampered wth fans and rundowns. This enhances the flavor of the meat. Finally I went to the restaurant and it surprised me in more than one way.   First of all, the atmosphere. It was nice. It felt expensive and all of the walls didn't have any stains on them. We got seated and the chairs where very nice. They where very comfortable. Ultimately the atmosphere is fantastic, they shouldn't change a thing.   The staff. They where friendly and helpful. They where willing to meet your demands and always help you anyway the can.   Cleanliness. People say you can judge a restaurants cleanliness. Well sw passes the test. It was very clean and nice. Marble hallways leading to it. Also the soap, water, and toilets where all automated. Good job you passed the test.   Food. Well i ordered the Kobe beef and got the tenderloin. I think I made the right choice. I cant even describe the taste. It was buttery smokey and delicious. On the side I got bok Choy. Delicious as well.  Overall impression. Sw steakhouse has earned a special place in my heart as one of the best places to eat.",

    "text": "One of the most overrated, expensive restaurants I've ever been to with quite average service.  Too many other better places to try in Las Vegas than this place.  Crowded, male dominant clientele (we were taking clients and they wanted a steak place) and we were seated next to wait station so trays etc. were carried literally over a guest's head all night.  Steak was presented on a white plate with nothing else on it so food presentation was hardly note-worthy and it was over cooked for requested done-ness.  The only really great food item that night was the pretzel rolls in the breadbasket.  Salad was enough for a meal unto itself - which I hate when restaurants do that.  Maybe because I just don't love Vegas I was looking for faults but I had a fabulous meal the night before in Sinatra - which I would go back to before heading here again.  Not a fan...",

Upon arrival, we waited in the bar about 10 minutes, but the bartenders were too busy talking to a group of girls (who all had full drinks) to pay attention to other patrons, so we were never served. When we got to our table, I immediately noticed my wine glass was caked with food particles, inside and out. I might expect this anywhere else, but not here. The waitress took it away as soon as she saw me examining it, or I would have taken a picture to post here. The meat was okay, but I have had better (more flavor other than charcoal). The potato side we got was so hard there were parts I couldn't chew. It also tasted like charcoal. It was far too loud in there as well. Had to yell to talk to my husband across the table. Not worth the time, anticipation, or money.",

That's how hard it is to make a resevation here. But it's definitely worth the wait!  I love the ambiance of this place, its so romantic and they also did well on the decor, simple yet looks beautiful and classy. It makes you think you're really beside the lake.  My favorite here are their lobster gnocchi, black truffle cream corn and the Ribeye!

I had the $220 4oz Kobe NY Strip. While it was a unique experience and delicious I'm not a convert mostly due to price.  But for a special occasion or just because it's Las Vegas maybe. The texture is fine and velvety and dissolves as you gently chew. Beautiful fat flavor without the heavy texture of fat on your palate Definitely something like I've never had. The drinks and apps and sides were all incredible. Highly recommend SW at Wynn.",

T.T I ordered the filet and my boyfriend got the bone in ribeye, and we got the truffle creamed corn and mushrooms for our sides. Every single dish was SPECTACULAR!!!!! Even the complimentary bread that they serve you in the beginning was amazing--like, I've never tasted bread at a restaurant that's THIS appetizing! They serve you several types of bread, and all of them were soso yummy! I seriously wanted to eat all of them, but I had to redeem myself and save room for my steak and sides. Must eat here when you're in vegas and craving for some steak! Try to get a table by the water so you can enjoy the view :)",

The outdoor seating is right on a man made lake with a waterfall surrounded by huge trees.  A truly beautiful setting with a show every 30 minutes or so with lights and music.   The service was fantastic too, very helpful servers who can take you through the menu. We had a very simple jumbo shrimp cocktail to start with a kale salad a Cesar salad and a bouwl of soup. I enjoyed the shrimp and my Ceasar salad and was told that the other salads and soup was delicous as well.   I had a 12 oz filet with 3 of there sauces all of which were great. In our group we also had the scallops, halibut, and another filet.  Everyone raved about there food.    The molton lava cake at the end was a nice finish. Small portion but very rich, wouldn't need more than a few bites to enjoy it. Overall a very cool trendy place to enjoy in Vegas. I would recommend to anyone who loves steakhouses or is looking for a great setting to enjoy.",

    "text": "The SW Steakhouse is located on the lower level of the Wynn Hotel and Casino. Hard to believe ten years have already passed since this property made its debut as a supposed competitor to the Bellagio for that best - in - class luxury property on the strip.  The SW Steakhouse is Wynn's answer to Bellagio's Prime.   The view from your table is spectacular. You look out at a stunning waterfall with lush trees and flowers on each side. It is gorgeous yet it gives off a very private feel as the tables are spread out yet SW can accommodate parties of all sizes in its large dining facility.   The top notch service you expect from a 5 star restaurant  is handled by a team of three servers for each table. A water glass never went unfilled yet we never felt they were being intrusive. I like that. There were several sommeliers on the floor to help with the extensive wine list (bottles priced more for celebrities like Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, David Beckham and Posh Spice who dined there last week or high rollers than common folk like us). We settled on a nice glass of Cabernet Sauvignon for 23 dollars each - a bargain on the wine per glass list as far as we were concerned.   The bread basket had mini torpedo rolls, bacon and cheddar muffins and pretzel bread sticks. The butter had a drizzle of olive oil and spices on top. I enjoyed the tasty torpedo roll, she enjoyed the pretzel stick. We each just had a taste.  First course was a split Caesar salad. The Parmesan crisp was incredible. The non- conventional dressing was heavy - perhaps a little overdressed. Still, it was a good choice.  For dinner we ordered the New York Bone In Dry Aged Strip. My lady ordered hers medium rare, mine was medium. Steaks arrived exactly as ordered. As advertised, they were extremely tender. Maybe the most tender steak we ever had. But beyond tenderness here is where we had a different opinion. I was very unhappy with the taste. It didn't stand out. Not for 68 dollars. Compared to steaks I've had at other fine steakhouses, this was a huge disappointment. Thankfully, the three in house sauces made it edible (I liked the more traditional of the choices) My lady disagreed and enjoyed hers very much and thought it tasted great.  We had mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus for our sides and they were more than enough to share.  We were too full to order desert.   There are so many steakhouses in Vegas. If we return, we will seek them out before returning to SW. They are seeking to be world class and in my opinion, they fall short.",

    "text": "Without exception, the best steak I have ever had. We went to SW Steakhouse for my friends bachelor's dinner. We had an early evening reservations and were promptly seated as we arrived. The restaurant has a beautiful ambiance and we were seated close to the wonderful view of the outside lagoon/waterfall.   For starters, we ordered Foie Gras both sauteed and terrine, and Tomatoes with Swiss cheese. Our main course was Chile Rubbed Double Rib Eye, and Double Cut Colorado Lamb Chops. Some sort of onion dish and Black Truffled Cream Corn as our side for the main course. We had Riesling for whites and Optimus cuvee for reds.    They offered 3 different breads, of which the jalapeno(or some other cheese?) with bacon was outstanding. As always, there will be no argument that Foie Gras, both sauteed and terrine, is heavenly; creamy, buttery, rich. My longing for Foie Gras is even more as it is now banned here in California. The Tomatoes with Swiss cheese was okay.  The main star of the show is the Chile Rubbed Double Rib Eye. Its hard to find a dinner table real estate to house this bad boy. It is placed in an manly cast iron casserole, with all the drippings, onions, and chile peppers in it. But the Colorado Lamb Chops didn't fade from the limelight. Four ribs sticking out stimulating your salivary glands: Eat Me. I obliged and took a bite of the lamb chop first. The first thoughts on my mind were: 'this cannot be?!' A well made steak always trumps over any lamb chop. And as far as I can remember, this is the best meat I have ever tasted (of course I haven't taken a bite of the Chile Rubbed Rib Eye yet!) It was so tender, and those little fat marbles melt in your mouth like butter. That classic lamb gaminess is still there, but it so well orchestrated (and no, not muted) its sooo good!   Then I went over to the Rib Eye. As soon as it got acclimated into my mouth, a lot of thoughts came rushing into me. I wish my grad father, who was a steak lover,  is still alive to taste is obnoxious rib eye. I wish I resided in Las Vegas. I wish this meat kept coming to our table. ITS THAT GOOD!!! The skin well charred but not burned. That chile gave a slight kick to the rib eye. Like the lamb chop, the rib eye fat marble melts in your mouth like butter! The meat is cooked perfectly. Everything about it is perfect. The Chile Rubbed Double Rib Eye was sooo good, it took me a while to realize that the Black Truffle Cream Corn was delicious as well.   The SW Steakhouse serves the best steak ever. The bar is set high with their excellent meats and awesome preparations.",

We got to sit on the outside terrace by the waterfall where there was an entertaining show every thirty minutes, each show was different. Attire was business dressy with optional jacket for the men. The ladies were in cocktail dresses.  This place was packed within thirty minutes of opening. Good thing we had reservations! The drinks were good. We had sweet lychee martinis and two bottles of Veuve Clicquot Rose.   Our waiter was very attentive and so sweet, he took multiple pictures for our group, even suggesting fun poses. He had excellent recommendations for wine pairings.   Food  The bread basket, ohhh emmmm geeee! The bacon cheddar muffin was so yummy. I gobbled down two of those, I couldn't help it. But I later regretted it when I was too full to finish my meal. There were also French croissants and pretzel bread too. But the bacon muffins were the best.   Foie gras As a Californian, I must say I have missed eating this back home. Very rich and flavorful.  Bone in rib-eye steak This was a good piece of steak, prepared medium-rare. Each bite essentially melted in my mouth n was very flavorful.   Lobster gnocchi with black truffle I still dream of this dish. The most decadent \"mac n cheese\" style dish I have ever had. There were actual shaved truffles n big chunks of lobster. I would've been happy just to simply eat this as my main entree for the rest of my life. It's so rich n extremely cheesy.  Ambiance is great, good spot to be seen before heading out for the night.",

We get there and we're told first come first serve for window seating.   We were then placed in the back of the restaurant. The service was confusing because we had three waiters help us even though we were supposed to have one. My cocktail had to be sent back due to lack of alcohol.    We orders are steaks and found them to redeem everything else.  Overall service was subpar but food was good. We will not be going back though because you can get good steaks and better service other places.  Oh. Also they allowed a dog in the restaurant! It was with an older man and did not have any service dog tags.  Because if this they lost another star.",

The bone-in ribeye was juicy and the filet mignon was perfectly tender. I also really enjoyed the variety of bread given before the meal. The appetizers weren't too appealing, unfortunately, but the main course makes up for it! The sides are also a good portion so plan on sharing those!   The service on the other hand was a little under par. Our waiter was friendly and nice, but most of the workers seemed uptight and were a little slow.  Overall, I would recommend it to a friend! Might try another place next time I'm in Vegas, but this place is definitely worth a visit!",

    "text": "I have been to SW about half a dozen times, and it is still my favorite steakhouse in Sin City. From start to finish, every single experience I've had here has been nothing short of impeccable. Shall we begin?  NOTE: Book reservations as far ahead as you can! Putting in a request for a view of the Lake of Dreams doesn't hurt either. This place gets packed very quickly and we've never risked going without rezzys.   SERVICE here has always been top of the line. I wouldn't expect anything else from within a Steve Wynn property. Water glasses are always filled and the table is frequently straightened out and picked up, be it actual plates/silverware or the microscopic piece of a sugar packet.   First of all: THE BREAD. OHHHHH, THE BREAD. While I will skip over their baguette type bread, I cannot rave enough about their cheddar-bacon rolls. Sheer bliss. Just take my word for it, especially if you're a fan of salt. However, there is a drawback...one time we were here, I hadn't eaten almost all day, so I quickly devoured almost three of these rolls. I was full for the rest of the dinner...whoops.   THE SALADS: TIP! Make sure you split these with someone else at your table. These lettuce and vegetable concoctions are monstrously sized and are worthy of the cut in half.  --Caesar: Standard Caesar, but I really like the tangier-and-creamier-than-normal dressing and the Parmesan crisp. --(Steve's?) Chopped Vegetable: Phenomenal. The avocado adheres the vegetables together and it is smoooooth sailing.  --Wedge: Ask for the dressing on the side! Also, there is a large offering of thick-cut bacon on the side, just off the cooker. AMAZING. Uhh...is there a trend with the bacon here?  THE STEAKS: I have had steak here each time, naturally. And out of the six or so times, I would say five of them have been incredible. The other one, while good, just lacked that oomph that the others had. I generally get the large Filet and split it with one of my family members or we will get the NY Strip. I prefer the NY.  --Perfect crusting, locks in the juices and is still immaculately cooked inside to your preference. --The trio of sauces you will probably have to ask for; there is a creamy Bearnaise, their house steak sauce (kind of..it's red-ish), and my favorite: Jalapeno Tropical Fruit. Just a dab on each bite really kicks up the taste notch. It's like fruity Tabasco almost.   THE SIDES:  --Black Truffle Creamed Corn: If you don't get this, you aren't getting your full SW experience. So good...you might order a second one (if you have room!) --Mac & Cheese: Not as memorable as the creamed corn. Kind of boring but still good.  --Au Gratin Potatoes: Some of the best I've had, but too rich. I always eat the least of these because they're so rich and filling.  --I know we've had other sides..but I can't think of them at the moment.   THE DESSERT: --Funnel Cakes: I promise you...this will be the perfect cap on your evening. The 5 or so fried dough pieces come hanging on a foot-tall metal \"tree\" presentation, accompanied by a trio of sauces: Chocolate, Salted Caramel, and a Vanilla one. The vanilla one is worth licking the bowl for. Even those are $18 or so...they are not an item to be passed up (...if you have room somehow after the 27 pounds of food you may have just consumed in your 1.5 hour sitting).  ...Oh, and the decor is nice too.",

I requested lake views both nights and they did not disappoint. Even if you do not get a lake side table, the view and visual shows every thirty minutes are not hard to miss.    We ordered the following:   Oysters on the half shell. I don't eat these raw, but the fiance said they were delicious and of different variations.  Jumbo Shrimp cocktail - always a good cold choice.  Tomahawk Chop w/ Crab Legs Oscar style - there are no words for this. My fiance was simply in awe. Perfectly cooked 30oz chop with crab legs and asparagus covered in bearniase sauce on top. YUM.  9oz Filet - Butter-like! Best steak I've ever had and I've dined in some swanky places all over LV. Could not have been more perfect.  Colorado Lamb Chops - Heavenly and of course, perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Au Gratin Potatos - worth every damn calorie.  Creamed Corned - I'm not a fan of corn, tried this one, still wasn't a fan, but my group def loved it.    Their selection of breads is incredible. Bacon muffins?! YES, PLEASE. This place is a definite must try if you're looking for an incredible dining experience with food and service to match.   I over indulged each visit so I didn't get to try their funnel cake dessert! Plenty of tables around us ordered it and it looks divine!",

    "text": "Short: Probably the worst dining experience I've ever had. Want to get full and feel just as disgusted afterwards? Just swing by your local McD's (and that's an insult to fast food everywhere). This birthday meal was so disappointing that it took 8 months of editing to write a balanced review. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere; folks on Yelp sometimes remark that they wish they could award 0 stars but that would be rating SW too highly.   Long: Four knocks against SW that keeps it from being a True fine dining establishment.  First- Regardless of whether the wine is inexpensive or a bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild, if you don't know the vintage, say you don't know! Please don't lie to us when you pour a far inferior vintage to the one you've listed on your wine list. That's borderline fraud. Second- When we catch you, you might want to admit fault and actually offer an apology instead of waving it off as an administrative mistake when the inferior vintage isn't even on your wine list. How many diners have you gotten away with cheating?  Third- If you serve tough, chewy A5 Wagyu (or what you claim to be A5 Wagyu) at $220/4 oz and then offer to replace and comp it, don't turn around and charge us for the inedible piece of meat that your kitchen messed up.  Fourth- After you've messed up A5 Wagyu, try expediting the order so that 1) the food doesn't arrive after the bill and 2) the victim doesn't need to dine alone.  One of the great things about Las Vegas is that you've got quality fine dining in just about every cuisine/genre imaginable. That means as diners, you've got choices! Don't squander a meal by eating at SW, you'll never get your time or money back.",

    "text": "I am giving SW a 4 and not a 5 bc I do believe it is a little overpriced.  But, with that being said, it was very very delicious and the service was amazing.  My husband and I split the pound of alaskan crab legs for 90$ as well as mashed potatoes, and then I got the small filet mignon and he got the boneless ribeye.  Both our steaks were cooked perfectly, the potatoes were great and the bread on the table was amazing.  We werent looking to break the bank, so we ordered the 2 least expensive red wines on the menu for about 25$ a glass, and they were also fabulous, one from spain and one cabernet/merlot mix. They are very accommodating, you are able to split about anything, they even offered to cook our steak at 2 different temperatures if we decided we wanted to split a steak.  The crab legs were okay, im not the biggest fan, but my husband loved them... not so sure they were worth 90$.  All in all the experience was amazing, it was one of the best steaks we have ever had, and were happy we went.  On our next trip we will probably visit another steak house to compare, and hopefully save a little money. Our meal came to about 330$ including tip. And they gave us 4 free little chocolate balls that said happy anniversary on the plate for free, so that was very nice.",

I had the 9oz Fillet Mignon which was good but certainly didn't make me do the happy dance and boss lady had a NY Strip that was just not good, at all.  Very chewy.  Both steaks were barely warm.  However, we did enjoy the Creamed Corn with Black Truffles but how can you f*ck up cream and truffles?  Impossible.  Also, you can't get a bottle of wine here for less than 300 bucks.  And we're not talking about rare, hard to find wines here.  We're talking stuff that you can buy at BevMo for 40 bucks.  The atmosphere is your traditional steakhouse feel.  If I was to dine here again, I'd prefer to sit outdoors.  Indoors was a bit stuffy.    The service was very friendly and if it wasn't for our waiter, I'd give this place 2 stars.  I know it's rude to mention another restaurant in a review but if you're looking for a good steak, trek on over to Eiffel Tower.  Now THAT is good cow.",

    "text": "Hands down the best restaurant in Vegas.  I ate at SW this past weekend in celebration of my sister in laws upcoming birthday.  I made the reservation 2.5 weeks in advance and put a special note indicating my sister's birthday.  From the moment we got there the level of customer service was unlike any I've ever experienced. When I checked in with the host he was friendly and even went as far as wishing my sister a happy birthday, we were then brought to our table which was located dead center and against the glass partition at the edge of the patio. The shows (which occur every half hour) were wonderful additions to the phenomenal food we had. The menu has a great selection of food and is accommodating to those who do not eat steak. I knew we were in for a treat the second we got the bread basket, perhaps the best arrangements of bread I've ever had; warm soft pretzels, mini baguettes and  cheddar & bacon muffins, and that's just to start!! I had a new york strip and it was cooked perfectly. The sides are delicious but I would recommend ordering a few for the table and sharing, we got the black truffle creamed corn (fantastic), mashed potatoes (perfectly seasoned) and the jumbo asparagus (so fresh). To finish off we ordered a creme brulee for the table and some coffee, both of which were great. The staff was so great about letting us enjoy our meal and our dining experience, unlike at other restaurants where you feel rushed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, however there are a few things to keep in mind.  1) If you want patio seating make a reservation!  2) This restaurant is a la carte so don't expect potatoes and veggie to come with your steak. That being said, the sides are large enough to share.  3)  It is on the expensive side but the quality of food and service makes it well worth it.",

A lot of people have commented on the chile rub (which was why we ordered it), and I thought the chile, while interesting, overwhelmed the steak. It was spicy and flavorful but overpowered the taste of the cut. If I'm paying $ for a quality steak, I want to be able to taste the quality. My suggestion would be to get the chile on a less expensive cut of meat, because I did think it was pretty good.   The black truffled cream corn (why hasn't anyone thought of this before?) was fantastic, and so was the house bread. I didn't think the decor was topnotch (felt too plain), and it was rather noisy and bustling because it was packed, but all in all, it was a memorable meal and somewhere I'd recommend to friends and family.",

It was a magical night and we always love dining in his restaurants.",

I alerted the front desk the next day, and the agent offered to comp the bill to my room. However I had paid by credit card. This began a frustrating process that ultimately led to an apology for their front desk agent \"misspeaking\" and refusing to honor their offer.  Great service while dining, solid but not spectacular flavors, overpriced, fun presentation, intestinal distress, awful customer service in the end.",

    "text": "Most of these reviews should not be taken seriously. Not to be rude, but if in your review you're telling people how to order their sides, you've obviously never been to a real steakhouse and should keep your comments to yourself.   I'm giving 3 stars because the food was ok and the manager pretended to be concerned. Aside from that, this place is a joke. You're seriously better off going down the street to Morton's where the food and the prices are better.   We were seated at 7:40 PM and did not get out of there until 10:40. It was an insanely horrible experience.   It took 40 minutes and asking twice to get bread, and when we asked for coffee, we were told that someone would be around to ask us if we'd like coffee. Seriously?  I cannot have coffee without you asking me first!?  Aside from the poor service the food is just ok. The Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly, however it is completely tasteless and served with cheap sauce to put on it. I felt like I was at one of those restaurants where you cook your steak on a hot stone at the table.   Seriously, if this is a dinner you've saved up to afford, don't waste your time or money. Go to Morton's, Fleming's or Ruth's Chris. I promise the food and service are 10 times better.   I do not recommend this place and will never be back.   And just so you know, we eat at restaurants like this once a week.....I guess it's Vegas though. No one will be back, so screw quality",

My wife and I visited here during our trip to Vegas to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary.  We had reservations and arrived 10 minutes early and were seated almost immediately at an outside table right on the water, best seat in the house. The waitress came over right away with menus and the beverage server was very quick to take our order. My grey goose martini was made perfectly and my wife said her specialty drink ( orange rose I believe) was delicious. The staff was very attentive and efficient the entire time.  For an appetizer we ordered the steak tartare. We never order things that are very very rare but we wanted to try something new. It was very good, prepared with a mayonnaise based sauce and toasted bread.   For dinner we both ordered the all natural grass fed filet, mine with a blue cheese crust and hers Oscar style. We also shared the teriyaki green beans. Everything was absolutely delicious, the seafood was fresh, meat cooked perfectly and the beans were crisp and flavorful. The blue cheese crust was perfectly balanced and prepared, I recommend that to anyone that likes toppings on their steak.   The dessert menu looked very good but we had no room left from dinner so decided to skip that.  We were given a few passion fruit truffles as a gift for our anniversary and these were excellent as well.    Prices are high but on par with any other high end steakhouse so I have no complaints there. If you can, be sure to get a table outside so you can watch the light show every 30 minutes. Next time you are in Vegas this place is a must!",

A great special occasion meal.   Honestly can't say enough good things about there entire meal.  This was a perfect celebration birthday dinner.  Very impressed.

The lady asked for how many people. He said,\"table for two please.\"  The lady said,\" we only have outdoor sitting at 5:25 pm and 6:00 PM. My boyfriend then said ,\" we'll take the 6:00 PM. We get there at 5:40 PM and the general manager Bradley Brown was very Condescending. He told us that we were not allowed to sit outside. We reminded him of our 6:00 PM reservation and he bluntly told us that there wasn't and tables reserved for us outdoors. Mr. Brown made us feel so uncomfortable. He offered us a corner table inside and basically told us to take it or leave it.  My boyfriend then just didn't want to stay anymore. Mr. Brown was a real jerk about our outdoor sitting reservation and didn't even intend to make it right by offering us a curtesy drink or anything. Meanwhile there was still a few empty tables outside. My boyfriend and I were hungry and decided to sit inside. Away from the corner table we were offered of course. Once we sat the food and drinks were great as usual but the general manager just ruined our reason for a revisit to this Steakhouse. It saddens me that such a delicious restaurant has an employee with such horrible attitude.  I just thought I should share this bad experience with you. Hope you never feel mistreated by this Manager.",

We walked in knowing what we were going to order based on a friend's suggestion and on a show from Food Network where someone pegged the chill-rubbed steak as one of the BEST things they ever ate.. my friend agreed so, we were sold!  There was a weird seafoodie smell either in the corner where we were sitting or it was a scent wafting thru the restaurant.. it threw me off bigtime. My hubby thinks someone dropped a piece of crabcake in the booth somewhere but.. it was a disgusting odor that, unfortunately, ruined my appetite somewhat and I just knew not to order the crabcake if it was what was stinking up the place!  First off.. let's talk about the bread basket with the adorable pretzel sticks...soft baked, so so warm and soft! They also had a bacon cheddar roll, but I was getting full at this point, as we'd had appetizers a couple hours prior so.. this was gonna fuck everything up if i went crazy with those cheese rolls too! I stuck to the pretzels and we befriended our bus person so we could get even more (oink oink!)  Dinner came and.. omg, that steak was FANTASTIC!! I took a photo, but it does it NO justice.. because the flavors in this steak are where the magic is! I saw someone else describe it as a grown-up Carne Asada and that's about the best description possible. I really could have used some corn tortillas to accompany this steak!  We opted for the potato puree and brussel sprouts. I hated the bacon in the brussels and was way too stuffed to take on more than a spoonful of potatoes!  Food here was amazing, I just wish we could have eaten more! Wine pairing and suggestions were also amazing! Dress code isn't as strict as you'd think.. I saw a man in here in a polo shirt and a poofy vest.. so best believe the folks that work here are not trippin if you're not fancy pantstin.",

However my husband & I took a chance and showed up around 7pm on a Saturday without any reservations and we were immediately seated.  We started with some mixed oysters, which were disappointing and the reason I cannot give SW a 5 star review despite loving everything else. The mixed oysters were small and flavorless. Also, the server never introduced the oysters to us, so we had no idea what we were eating. We also shared a Caesar salad which was delicious and generous in portion.   As a main I ordered the Hawaiian snapper with green olives, tomatoes, capers, lime. It was delicious. Also very generous portion size which I couldn't finish.  The sides, which were great, consisted of creamed spinach and french fries.  I was overall really pleased with the meal and the experience. The only hiccup was the oysters but I'd definitely come back!",

The super cool lake/pond with edgy music and awesome special effects alone is worth it. We started with the chopped salad and the octopus. The salad had some amazing flavor, avocado, and crispy Potatoes... I.e. Fancy but amazing potato crisps. The octopus was very tender and rich and served over a bed of spicy chickpeas. We told the restaurant about my gluten allergy and they brought me gluten free rolls which were incredible-- something I'm not used to when it comes to bread.   Meal: chicken-- was amazing-- with broccolini, potatoes, and carrots over some delicious jus, I was just in awe of how perfectly it was cooked-- with crispy skin. The New York strip was excellent as well.  The sides: sauteed vegetables included squash, zucchini, carrots, and snow peas, all cooked to perfection-and a nice healthy portion- yum!  The fries: cheesy and good. Not the best I've ever had but a large portion size. To be honest, I was too full to eat more than one..  Do yourself a favor and request this one ahead of time: the molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream. Warm, gooey center which melts in your mouth. Typically served with chocolate ice cream but request vanilla! Gluten free and so amazing. So so amazing!  Just wow.  I am so full and so happy. Much better than almost all of the any of the other meals I've had in Vegas. And I'll definitely be back!",

Hostess staff was not very friendly, I am assuming it was because we didn't slip the guy money like the person in front of us. Wait staff was great, very friendly, but were really up selling.  Food...great steak for people who don't know great steak. My brother and I both ordered a filet med rare, both were over cooked and very bland in flavor, probably the worst filet we have ever had. Others in our group had scallops and a strip steak that they both said were pretty good. Our side dishes were ok, we got the au gratin potatoes and the gnocchi, which was very odd for gnocchi but still tasted ok. The ambience was pretty bad, very old and outdated.",

    "text": "Service was great! The waiters and sommelier were very attentive and informative. I shared the peppercorn chateaubriand which was cooked to perfection, however, the natural flavors of the meat were a bit hidden by the strong peppercorn taste instead of being complimented by it.  Our friends got the filet mignon, Waygu beef and rib eye which were all delicious and tender. The menu offers add-ons to the steaks such as bleu cheese which one of us put on the rib eye and enjoyed. Sides were very delicious, my favorite being the creamed spinach (probably the best I'd ever had!). Close seconds were the Mac and cheese and chive cream rosti potatoes. Definitely a nice experience. Good for groups as well!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were guests at the Wynn and looking to get a good steak. We walked in SW and got a table. We ordered the foie gras as an appetizer and the porterhouse for two (sides of fries and mac&cheese). The foie gras was ok, not bad but not great (I thought it was cheap for about 20 dollars so no complains).  The porterhouse was AMAZING ! very thick, very well cooked, the filet side literally melted in my mouth. We could not finish it since it was so big. Probably the best piece of meat I have ever had and for only 120 dollars ! It's a steal, I have had porterhouse for more that were nowhere near to this one.  The fries were not great, a little disappointing next to the steak. The mac&cheese was good but a steakhouse with so-so fries is a little sad in my opinion mainly when the meat is this great ! The other thing is the wine list. They have GREAT wines, but TOO GREAT in my opinion. I was looking at the french wines and they are all prestigious wines (Petrus, cheval blanc)... for a prestigious price... not comparable to the rest of food menu (in my opinion). I was excited to get a nice bottle of Bordeaux (should be around ~200) there was no such thing. I had a great St Emilion a Ramsay's steak for ~150. They do have a Croze-Hermitage for ~100 that was actually quite good.  In conclusion, this is a nice restaurant, great value for the food and the meat is out of this world, the setting is nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would put 3.5 star. The wine list really bothered me... and so did the fries...",

I have to say, I am impressed with the food, service and atmosphere of the place.  Added bonus, dinner was comped by the hotel.  Seafood platter - fresh & delish! I get instant allergic reaction to seafood that's not well-handed. Safe! so that's an easy 4 stars.  foi - fig sauce and light cracker made this dish a hit with those that haven't had the nerve to try yet. * 5 stars kobe / filet - shared kobe roast and filet with a friend and both were fantastic! Connection: ridiculously amazing! *5 stars & * 5 stars lamb - 4 star, it wasn't baby lamb but still tasty. funnel cake - 5 STARS+++! I'm going back just for the funnel cake! I'd call it 'funnel organsimica cake'. (see pix)  Last but not least, 2 bottles of Opus one and 1 Perrier Jouet rose went down smoothly with the delicacy.  Tip to reader: go with high rollers to vegas!",

I split the ribeye medium rare with my mother which came out nice and juicy, and the wife's pea risotto scallops were delicious. Our side of whipped buttery potatoes were also perfect to go along with the steak.   Two other shared the 42 ounce chili rubbed ribeye which i got a taste of and i liked it. The steak wasn't necessarily spicy, but had a nice spice to round out the flavor of the steak. I'm not sure how it is after eating 20 ounces of it, but the bites that i had were good.  On the other side of the table, the other two ribeyes came out medium instead of medium rare, and the other sides weren't very impressive.  The bread basket is also kind of amazing.",

How about asking if you don't know?  Bread basket had a really good bacon and cheese muffin, highly enjoyed that one.  Everything is a la carte, so plan on racking up the dollars to get what you want.  I had the 8 oz Filet in the coffee rub - it came as two large medallions and the steak was a little overcooked for medium.  We shared two sides - the creamed corn - cannot recommend this - more like puree of corn with truffle sauce in there somewhere.  Looked like someone hurled it up and they heated and served.  The potatoes au gratin were pretty good.  These side dishes really only serve two people, so if you have a group, you may need a few other items. Actually preferred Sinatra, which we tried last trip to the hotel.  There is a fun show that happens out the window every 1/2 hour that was impressive.  It was worth the visit to try it, but so many great places on the Strip and even within the complex, that this one won't be on my repeat list.",

We had the first dinner reservation time and were seated outside along the lake.  Lovely spot and great location for the show later.  I do wish the show had started a bit earlier so that we could have enjoyed it more than once.  Our service was attentive and helpful.  Some reviewers seemed to feel it was not attentive enough, but from my observations, the servers in general did not seem to want to be intrusive after they helped you with your selections.    The bread basket was amazing.  Loved it!  The bacon bread was delicious.  The steaks were perfectly cooked.  I was not a fan of the creamed corn, as I have enjoyed a better version in Chicago.  We had some type of banana dessert with ice cream, and although the chocolate was very hard to cut through, it was a perfect dessert.  I loved this restaurant and cannot wait to return.",

The meat that I devoured was deliciously thick in girth and perfect in length.  It was perfectly cooked.  Just right in tenderness, not overly stiff and had plenty of juices flowing.  My god.  Ohhhhh. Myyyyyyy. Gooooooooood!! Oh. Baby!! Babbbbbbbby!!! Ohhhhhhhhh Baaaaaaaaabbbbby!! Give me MORE!! I want MORE!!!  As if this perfect piece of meat wasn't enough in my mouth, I found my mouth savoring in the most flavorful and creamiest Truffled Creamed Corn.  Texture wise, it was pretty creamy and not many lumps . ..  Ummmm ('nuff said) but the taste ... if all creamy things tasted this amazing perhaps more women would swallow more often (I'm just saying)  The sommelier paired my OHHHH baaaaabby rib eye steak with a savory Rhone from the chateauneuf du pape region.  My dessert wine...holy shiznitz, I think I may have bitten into the wine glass to ensure I tasted every last morsel.  The only disappointment was their chocolate souffle.  it was subpar, mediocre, meh, I've had better.  But it's okay because I thoroughly enjoyed the main course.  One thing I also did not enjoy at all was the bacon cheese rolls.  Blech!! But the butter was, yup, you guessed it, Nice and Creamy!!!  OH, and I forgot to mention the Jumbo Shrimp appetizer....my god, those things were HUGE . . . and size does matter, you better be damned sure I wanted my shrimp large and meaty and these shrimps did not disappoint.",

The main problem was that everything was just ok, and a couple of things were good, but nothing was great. We had shrimp cocktail and oysters as appetizers; just ok. We both had filets and we shared the Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts; the steaks were ok and the sides were good. Again, nothing was great - food or service wise.

Dropped 300 for a meal worth 100 tops.   I think I will stay with craftsteak and cut, both providing that bang for the buck and the GI Joe with Kung Fu grip fun, instead of the ol tinker toys....",

    "text": "I had a great dinner at SW Steakhouse! I think 5 start would be a little much because 1. why in the hell is there no website with a menu? I think that would alleviate some of the \"it's expensive\" complaints. Cuz guess what's....it's expensive! 2. this whole \"lake of dreams\" stuff...over rated. It was fine, but didn't make my $120 steak taste any better, wasn't so romantic it was a panty dropper....yea, I said panty dropper. It's ok!   We stayed at Encore and when you turn on the tv it gives you information about Encore and Wynn. The marketing people that created the little informercial added that it is VERY HARD to get into SW Steakhouse. Hilarious that my friend and I looked at each other and both said LET'S GO THERE! I called the concierge and there was no trouble whatsoever getting in. Hmmmm. Darn marketing people! We convinced ourselves it was because we were staying in a suite at their hotel.   We got to the restaurant on time and they seated us almost immediately. We never asked for a view of the lake but we got one. I had completely forgot about that detail..maybe the concierge handled it...I dunno. The service was really good. My friend does not drink but discovered a new cocktail while in Vegas, so we asked for it by name and they were unfamiliar. It's called sex with an alligator or sexy alligator. We gave the ingredients and they came back with a drink - said they looked it up. I thought that was cool - I do want to note that if you google that drink, every link I look at is specific it is a layered drink, this came shaken. No big deal I just read another reviews praise of the unbelievable bar staff. We all have off days.  I had the beet salad which was fabulous. We decided on Chateaubriand - which was SO good!!! Like, I want more now so good. The sides were disappointing and we (ok I) picked potato puree - don't do it! It is not mashed potatoes...it's a major thin, you could drink this puree. Ewww. Not as good but really...who cares - that Chateaubriand was THAT good! Oh, and it was like $120 plus the apps, sides, and cocktails (of course)...just given you an idea of cost. I am pretty sure it is not possible for 2 people to eat here for less than $150 and that is if you don't get cocktails or apps.  BUT if you have that in mind and are prepared...it's a damn good meal.  I would go back - but I don't really care if I am near the lake of dreams...I'd rather have a more private table.",

Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed for long.   The Foie Gras with huckleberry compote was so...amazingly...good!! It made up for the Blue Eye Tuna Tartar that was a bit under-seasoned but very fresh. Now for the steak...it far exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Bone-In New York medium-rare and it came out PERFECTLY! A nice crust with a center that was evenly cooked throughout. It wasn't over seasoned and there was no sauce to ruin it...just a beautiful piece of meal that's beautifully cooked. I couldn't have asked for more...MMMM! My top 3 steakhouses ever.  Favorite: Foie Gras (god, it was soooo good!)  Impressed by: My steak (a friend ordered the wagyu beef that wasn't much more tender or tastier than my steak)  Surprised: The butter they served with the bread (some sort of black salt over super creamy butter, I wouldn't let the waiter take it away!)  Fail: Lobster Mac-n-Cheese (didn't like it too much)",

    "text": "What a terrible customer service for such a pricey restaurant. Can't believe this place is even a fine dining restaurant. I came here for my birthday celebration with my family during our stay at Wynn. I have made a reservation in one week advance to make sure we get a table outside in the patio with good view of the lake. Of course they did told us that it wasn't a guarantee, but I expected them to try their best to accommodate to our special request as close as possible. That's how it has always been with my other experiences at other fine dining places. I have gone to a lot of top notch restaurant and honestly this place is far off from a fine dining experience.  First off, when we arrived, we were greeted by a hostess and she led us to our table... my family was dumbfounded at the table they gave us even though we called in for reservations with special request. They placed us at a table with a view that is not even close to our request, our view was blocked from a gigantic wall column and to make it worst the table was facing the kitchen and the restroom. I mean seriously? We made a reservation and this is the best service you could do? We then discussed about the option of switching to another table, but the hostess said their patio is closed because of the chance of rain. Well, I  don't know what kind of excuse is that when other restaurants at Wynn with a patio sitting option are all sitting their guests in the patio that same night. But alright, we tried to compromise so we asked them to sit us at a table with at least a good view if they can't sit us in the patio but the hostess keep giving excuses after another. She said we have to make a reservation in order to have those privileges, I told her we did. Then she said it has to be a week in advance, this time I got really angry because I can see her just simply lying to us but I still told her politely that we did made a reservation in one week in advance... what's next? She continues saying it has to be a month to be a guarantee... uhm... are you even ashamed? It was so obvious she was lying.  Next, she walked us up to the manager and obviously we also hear  the same excuses from him and what not. When we nicely complained to him how disappointed we were, he didn't even gave us an ounce of respect. He just told us off, \"if you want to leave, then leave.\" WOW unbelievable! Excuse me, who do you think you are to act so arrogant? Besides your restaurant, there are plenty of places I could of gone to. In contrary, you should of been thankful that we chose you.  After realizing how rude and unprofessional their services were, my family choose to walk away and try Lakeside Restaurant, which is right across from this place. Fortunately for us, Lakeside saved our night with a top notch customer service. Every dollar I spent at Lakeside was worth it. Even though they couldn't perfectly accommodate to our request because we walked in without a reservation and requested a patio table, they tried their best to sit us at a good view table after they learned that it was my birthday. Although it was a one hour wait, it was worth it. Advice for SW Steakhouse, you better step up your game. Train your employees better and hire a more professional general manager. You better live up to the fine dining class. I felt that your employees were pretty racist after learning that we are asian.  I'm glad I didn't spend a penny here. I will never come back here or recommend this place for anyone.",

Big group sometimes equals less than stellar service but not at SW, it was perfect.  Probably the best New York strip I have ever had.  Every food item prompted raves except Scallop Risotto which was too heavy on the truffle oil, which seems to be a universal affliction in the high end restaurant industry today.  But forget that - SW is amazing. Go there.  If you have been wondering if it's expensive it is, but worth it. Also the Wynn in general is one of the most beautiful environments imaginable expecially the pool areas.",

Beet Salad:  I am not a Beet Fan, but the wife is...her review: Excellent LAMB :  I thought was a too \"sweet\". It covered up the True lamb flavor. PAN ROASTED SEA SCALLOPS: Excellent BONE-IN RIB EYE 20 ounces:  Minus Excellent.  Not enough flavor...weird right?  I know...I left wishing it was better too. (That's why the 4 stars) TRUFFLED CREAMED CORN :  Holy $hit this was amazing!  GET THIS SIDE!! AU GRATIN POTATOES:  I know what your thinking...its freakin au gratin potatoes...but, man...I wish I ordered a double order.  Desert was the funnel cakes...yes, funnel cakes.  I am not going to give anything away here, but you gotta get the funnel cakes.  Service was excellent.

    "text": "Date: 11/25/2013 Check: 2779 Server: 1906047 Shannon  First off, let me say....we have visited many restaurants on the strip.  I believe Bartolotta at the Wynn is perhaps the best restaurant on the strip.  Well, we decided to try SW Steakhouse.  I called ahead (one week) and requested a seat outdoors so we could watch the light show on the lake.  The people at the restaurant said \"no problem\" and guaranteed me a seat outside.  I asked again, and they said I would have a seat outside \"guaranteed.\"    The time came for our reservation on November 25 of last year.  Our seater came and got us and started taking us through the restaurant and not outside.  I thought \"ok...maybe this is the way to go outside.\"  No.  They seated us inside the restaurant.  I told our server that we are supposed to be outside.  She got the manager and the manager said they have a party going on outside and there is no seating available.  I looked outside (actually walked out there) and there was plenty of seating available.  Nothing was roped off for a party, and the guests sitting out there were not there \"for a party.\"  I know this because I asked them.  The manager then proceeded to tell me the party will occur later.  I asked when....and he said later.  The manager said he would make up for it by giving us amazing food and service.  We will see....I decided to eat anyway so I could at least experience the food and service.  At this point; however, I was not happy.  I just lost money playing poker at Treasure Island as well so somebody has to feel my wrath...might as well be a steak house.  Food:  I ordered the lamb chops.  Perhaps the worst lamb chops I have ever eaten.  So much unrendered fat that they were inedible.  It was sitting on a pool of greasy stuff that they said was a sauce.  I guess the stuff in the grease traps at McDonald's is a sauce as well?  Not their best effort by a long shot.    Service: The waitress was only there one time to ask for our orders and we never saw Shannon again.  I got lamb, and my wife and daughter got steak.  She didn't come by to ask us if our steak was cooked properly or if my lamb was cooked properly.  The only person there was the guy that refilled our water and bread.  I told him about my lamb and he said he would tell my waitress.  She never came.  We never saw her again for the rest of the night.  I believe she is a female version of Bruce Wayne...fighting crime while trying to put up this waitress facade.  She is a crummy waitress, but she makes the world a safer place so I suppose she can have a break from too much criticism.  Oh....by the way.  The party never happened.  Unless it is a part of invisible David Copperfields.  Nobody was out there.  Maybe it was a party for dead people like some weird M. Knight Shyamalan movie.  So...I lost money at TI and was screwed over at SW.  However, I got to meet a superhero's alter ego mascarading as a waitress.  So I now have something to tell my grandkids if I have grandkids.  The lamb I ate might have made me sterile.",

For entrees we ordered the Fillet Mignon, wild Scottish Salmon, and the sushi grade Blue Fin Tuna. The best tuna I've eaten since dinning at Morimoto's in Philly. To top off the meal we ordered the fabulous, little, chocolate souffle...AMAZING!    The whole dinning experience there was unforgettable! The atmosphere, food, service! We sat outside by the water which was just great because it is relaxing and every half an hour they have a little water show.     I highly recommend this restaurant.

Had to wait a bit to get seated, they have a pretty decent bar....but a reservation is supposed to be a reservation, not a 20 minute wait.  Pretty decent steakhouse....not too bad, not too great.....good (but not excellent) service, good meal, etc.  Some might think the environment is fantastic, others may find it tacky and annoying/over-the-top (green animated snakes and bs like that).  But hey, it's Vegas.  The wine was fantastic (the sommelier obviously knew what he was talking about), the salad and appetizers were fine (always a fan of crabcakes), the steaks were decent (alot of people like the bluecheese on top, but I personally would avoid it next time I go).  But were they \"divine\", \"cooked to perfection\", \"spectacular\"?  Nah.  The bottom line is this.....if you've been to solid steakhouses from wherever you're from, then SW might seem average.  For example, if you're from SF, and you've been to House of Prime Rib, Bobo's, etc, then SW is no big deal....just another expensive Vegas steakhouse that'll cost you $150/person.  Is it better than the other steakhouses in Vegas?  Yup, definitely.  Does the fact that it's at the Wynn, it has an \"exclusive\" reputation, and it's packed solid with beautiful people make SW a bit overhyped?  Yup, definitely.",

    "text": "I went to SW with a group of 7 and we had an early reservation of 6 pm. We had a nice table in the main dining room that faced outdoors. The space itself is very chic and well done, although the bathrooms are a bit tricky to find! Our waiter was extremely nice and patient with us, and gave good advice to some in our group on what to order. Definitely top notch service, which is what I would expect at a place like SW.  However, the food was disappointing. My husband enjoyed his steak, but it didn't blow his mind. I tried a friend's goat cheese ravoli, and while they were good and made me wish I had ordered them, they could have used a bit more goat cheese. I also tried the scallops my friends split...those were good; not gritty and cooked very well. However, they didn't melt in my mouth to put them in the truly exceptional category. I ordered the Maryland blue crab cake appetizer. OK I appreciate the lack of filler and that it was almost entirely crabmeat, but it was missing the big chunks of crabmeat I look for in a really good crab cake (I'm from Maryland, so I'm picky). Also, it was much too moist for my taste. I don't like them too moist, but not too dry. The most appalling part of my meal was the caesar salad I ordered. Not only was it not that large (definitely not worth the $14 price tag it carried), but it was almost inedible. The dressing left a lot to be desired and the fact that it was drowning the lettuce did not help. My friend sitting next to me took a bite and if I had a picture for the face he made, it would have summed it up perfectly. Thank goodness I had $14 expresso martinis to drown out the taste of the dressing.  For our group of 7, our final bill came to $500. Our waiter was very nice and reduced our bill by the cash we had and then put the balance on a debit card...not every restaurant is that accomodating. While $500 was not bad for a group of our size, all of whom had at least one alcoholic beverage if not two, I personally didn't feel that the food was worth what we paid. Any place that can't get a salad right...well is just not a place worth returning on a future visit.",

My girlfriend (fiance to be) and I went on a Tuesday night (happened to be our anniversary) Upon entering I found that their was a bit of \"to be seen\" going on in the front bar area. I was a bit shocked to see ladies in short shorts and jeans at an establishment like this. Restaurants of this caliber should have a dress code to keep everyone feeling like their $150 meal is an experience and not just fast food with a large bar tab. The place was dark but extremely loud, all of the staff was very friendly and made us feel right at home. It was romantic but we felt like we were at a sporting event not a fine dining restaurant. Our waiter was impeccable and his recommendations and descriptions were spot on. The food was done to perfection as you would expect at this level. We would defineatly go back but with the understanding that it is not a formal place and is more of a great place to entertain a client not take your fiance or wife for a romantic evening. Food is great but that is to be expected at this level. I would of like to see a bit of dining tradition and formality when spending $300 for a couple's meal.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  At a five star five diamond hotel, in a restaurant where you are going to spend $150 per person, it is reasonable to expect a great experience.  Unfortunately,  there were some rookie mistakes with our meal.  But even before we sat down there were some issues.  First, when my friend and I arrived for our reservation, they made us wait when there were clearly tons of two tops tables.  When we went to the bar for a glass of wine while waiting, the bartender was rude and made me feel like I was bothering him.  Not a great start.  As for the food: For a starter, I ordered the procuitto parmesean fettucini for $16.  When it arrived it looked great, but when I dug in all I could taste was pepper.  Seems the chef went a little bit crazy with the grinder and I couldn't even taste any of the other ingredients.  The pasta was cooked properly, but it was really not good otherwise.  My friend ordered a fois gras that was off the menu for a starter (she likes it seared vs. the terrine they had on the menu).  It was great that they were happy to make something special, but when it arrived the texture was off and it was hard to cut through - which is ridiculous. I'm not sure how much they charged for this item, but the terrine was $21.  I'm guessing this was more.  Moving on to our main courses:  I had the diver scallops ($30 something) and Linda had the filet mignon ($52ish).   The steak was perfect (to me), but was cooked to the wrong temperature for her.  My scallops tasted like they had been dipped in black pepper first.  What is UP with the pepper?????  For sides we ordered the truffle creamed corn and the potato au gratin ($10 each).....yes, it was a carb fest!  Both were very good, but the texture of the corn was a little strange.  The wines by the glass offering was awful.  They had two chards, one pinot grigio and a sauv blanc for the whites and ranged in price from $12 to $20 a glass.  I didn't check out the reds.  Since Linda and I have different tastes in wine, we didn't order a bottle and it's always a disapointment to have such limited options when spending so much.  The two stars are for the service and for the bread basket.  Our server was attentive, funny and even seemed to enjoy his job.   And the bread basket was really good too.  It was filled with mini fresh french baguettes and these yummy bacon, cheddar buns.  The butter was room temperature and had interesting salts and olive oil drizzled over it.",

    "text": "My wife took me here for my birthday and we were both looking forward to a great meal because of all the positive reviews.  The atmosphere was very nice and the service was above average.  However, both of us had the same opinion the restaurant is way over priced for the lack of creativity and preparation of both our meals.  $54 for a 9oz fillet Mignon and $48 for Chilean Sea Bass, and $16 for a side of mushrooms.  My wife asked for the rub used on the rib eye and it almost ruined the meat.  We love spicy but the chef needs to come up with a better rub and learn how to balance the ingredients.  He/She over used cumin and you could literally smell/taste it as it overpowered the rest of the rub ingredients.  My fish was good, but again it was basic and lacked creativity.  We had better Bass at Roy's for a lot less.  Again the chef needs to learn how to season his dishes because the mushrooms would have been very good if they had not over salted them.  The chocolate souffle was very good, but I was perplexed by his choice of dish used to cook it in.  They used a shallow square dish and I hit bottom real quick as I prepped it for the small scoop of vanilla ice cream. You are paying for ambiance at this restaurant and settling for an average chef.  The Wynn should really take a look at who they have and consider either getting a new chef or lowering their prices.  We don't mind spending money on a great meal, but our meals were definitely not great.  In this review pricing played a big role because who ever is doing the cooking does not meet the standards of a $$$$ type of restaurant.",

They were all great, but my favorite is the Foie Gras!!! YUMMY!!! We ordered Seared Hawaiian Tuna, Halibut, Scallops, Rib Eye steak, and Filet Mignon. For side dishes we've ordered Au Gratin potatoes, Truffled creamed corn, and Creamed Spinach...  My Rib Eye was really tender and good... However, we ALL agree that the Seared Tuna was the BEST!!!!!  WOW,  it just melted in your mouth and was seasoned PERFECT!!!  We love this place.. However, the BEST was our most AWESOME Sommelier Noel.   His level of customer service and knowledge he has with wine is by far the BEST!!!!  He is one of the main reason why we LOVE SW Steakhouse so much!!!!   We finished our dinner by ordering cheese cake, sorbet trio, and cream Brulee.. AND by Noel's recommendation, shot of Nocello Walnut Liquor..  WOW, it was so delicious!!!  We walked out FULL and Happy!!!  I can't wait til our next Vegas trip!!!!",

    "text": "Not much mystery about what this restaurant serves, eh? Now, as to the name...Steve Wynn has a healthy ego. This restaurant bears his initials (another restaurant - Wing Lei - is the Chinese version of his name). I'm not really a steak person. However, I had heard good things about SW, and in any case was trying to eat my way though Wynn.  In some ways, the atmosphere is typical steakhouse: busy and noisy. There are lots of browns and tans. The restaurant has a view of the Wynn water show. However, my table was too far away to see anything except for colors reflected off the trees. Service was generally efficient, and courses were well paced. Minor issues: my server was slow to take my order; my server and various assistants came across as a bit impersonal.  On to the meal! *  Foie Gras Duo. The first was pate de foie gras with specs of truffle, some fruit puree for sweetness, and toasted brioche. It was buttery, creamy, smooth, with pretty good flavor. Rating: good to very good. The second was sauted foie gras on a bed of nectarines and onions. It was a very large hunk of foie gras - rich and flavorful. It lost a few points because it was so thick that there was too much soft insides as compared to the seared outside. Still, very good to excellent. *  Filet Mignon with Three Sauces. The filet was about 2-1/2 inches thick, crusty, maybe with butter on it. It cut easily, was tender as could be, but also had excellent flavor - the best steak I've ever had. The Bernaise sauce was my favorite: thick, rich, tangy, wonderful in every way. *  Baby vegetables (string beans, yellow squash, carrots, pea pods). They were pretty good, but too crisp even for me, a crisp vegetable lover.  Of the three steak houses I've visited (including Delmonico and StripSteak), SW Steakhouse is my favorite. That's from an admittedly small group of restaurants, but I was impressed.",

However the experience was horrible.  Our waitress made a point of gesturing to the specials on the menu and then said I won't explain them you can just read them.  Um isn't that her job to explain the menu?! We asked for just the pretzel bread but were given the mixed bread with no explanation of what types of bread we were being given. The restaurant was EXTREMELY loud and my boyfriend and I couldn't even have a conversation because we couldn't hear each other over the noise.  Our food was good.  We had the chateaubriand which was melt in your mouth tender, the potato au gratin and the tuna ceviche.  Throw in a salad and a bottle of wine and your talking about a $300 meal that was probably the most disappointing of my life.  To top it off the waitress never asked how our meal was or why were so eager to get our check and leave.  I really expected more from the Wynnn!",

    "text": "Finally, I got a reservation to this place after learning the trick.  Don't call, just use the online system.  I love to try steak places and this one has been on my list for two years.  I would say, I am so happy to try it. This review is a 2.80 score  rounding up to a 3.  a.  Ambiance - Inside the lovely and luxurious Wynn hotel!  What better place to dine when the location and ambiance is A-1.  This is 5 Star.  b.  The place - The restaurant is located to the right of valet and down the escalators. It is noisy, it is crowded and inside the restaurant, the music is a bit loud and the \"show\" that is in the pool outside of the restaurant is either hokey or dopey, not fitting the grand eloquence of this fine dining establishment.  1 star.  c.  Dress Code - What happened?  When you speak to them or reserve, they tell you their strict dress code.  Dressy Casual or Business Casual, collared shirts, dress jeans.  Hello, I guess they let the \"cool\" people in that are dressed down because they still look trendy funky, not trendy chic.  I don't get it, however, either enforce the code or not.  1 star.  d.  Food - Exquisite!  5 star overall - Appetizers consisted of Bigeye Tuna Ceviche, Crabcakes and Roasted Beets.  My god, these were great, tasty, subtle and just right.  5 star. - Main course - Bone In Rib Eye 20 oz baby! and Filet Mignon - 9 or 12 ounces, we had the 9 ounce.  Melts in your mouth! Vegan - Of course, since Steve Wynn is a Vegan, I had the faux Chicken and Chickpeas. Absolutely Amazing! - Dessert - We were celebrating a big birthday and they surprised us with a beautifully large dish with Happy Birthday written on it and three mints and a candle. While not overpowering, definitely delicate and classy.   e.  Service - 2 star at best. - Check in was 5:30.  We wanted indoor as we said we preferred less noise (due to waterfall) and warmer.  They said outside was heated. We opted for indoor. They sill tried to seat us outside, but got it corrected quickly. - Being one of the few in the restaurant, at 5:30 it is only 10% full, they seated us at the worst place, along the middle where everyone walks and the worst view and the worst privacy.  Not sure how they consider this great or even neutral, as we were celebrating a 50th Birthday, told them this and we are locals as well.  We don't expect the royal treatment, but to put us in the worst spot in the restaurant, I say, not nice. - Our waitress was awesome when she was available. Another person had to step in and help because we were not getting service. He was nice too.  Nice, just ineffective and inefficient.  The guy that fills the water was the best. I must have drank 2 liters of tap water that night and he was right on it!  Overall, a great place, just that the service suffers and the specialness of the place is negated by the poor service. Maybe not poor, indifferent is a better word. From the front desk person or reception, to the person that seats you.  It took our waitress about 10 minutes to introduce herself.  This is when the restaurant is empty.  Indifferent is the best I can say.  I would go back, the food was awesome!  If  you are paying about 100-150 per person, you do expect consistency in the quality service.",

    "text": "Excellent meal, service to perfection, and a room with a 5-star view.    First, what can be said about the Wynn other than it is a modern classic.  SW is a perfect fit with the Wynn.  Descending the stairs from the Wynn lobby, you are greeted by a grand entrance to SW, with an intimate yet modern bar t the left, and a continuation of the refined parasol-theme as you are greeted by the impeccably-coifed maitre d' and elegant  hostesses.  While the dining room is impressive, with bronze and white stone influences, we were fortunate to be seated on the outdoor terrace overlooking the Lake of Dreams.  The view was breathtaking.  After being seated, we were immediately greeted by two of our wait staff who were friendly, professional and well-informed about the menu and specials.  We actually spent a lot of time on the menu and asked a lot of questions as there were so many things that appealed to us.  Our waiter was patient with our questions and was able to answered all of them.    The sommelier was also excellent.  We were at first not too impressed with the wine list mostly because we were nt familiar with the wines within the price range we were willing to pay.  Again, the sommelier was so patient and had extensive  knowledge about the list.  He asked the right questions, getting from us not only what we were planning on ordering, but also the types of wines we likes and the qualities we like in our wines.  We decided to have faith in him as he recommended two diferrent wines -  a lighter, medium-bodied grenache from Paso Robles, to be followed by a bolder, full-bodied and spicy Spanish red.  The sommelier was spot-on with his recommendations. We loved the reds.  As for our meal - we started with the oysters on the half shell.  They were wonderful with the red wine mignonette and cocktail sauce.  I ordered the filet while the three others in our party all ordered the bone-in ribeye with chili rub.  My filet was cooked perfectly.  Great flavor and texture.  I kept it simple - no rubs or sauces, but the waiter was kind to bring some drawn butter on the side just in case.  The 20 oz. rib-eyes were impressive.  My mates could not stop talking about how much they loved their steaks, and they loved the chili rubs.    For sides, we had the black truffle cream corn (so amazing -- I could not get enough of this);  creamed spinach (good, but nothing unique about it); au gratin potatoes (great balance of crisp and moist) and Cipollini Onion & Charred Jalapeno (interesting combination of sweet, tart and spice).    I wish I could tell you about desserts as the menu looked amazing, but we were all so full to even think about ordering dessert.  As a side, we saw at least five of the \"shows\" at the Lake of Dreams.  The shows were on the strange-side for my taste; sometimes beautiful and impressive, other times just plane strange.  Think Circque de Soleil meets Tim Burton meets Salvador Dali.     Overall a very memorable dining expereince.  We will be back.",

Jose and James were our servers and attendant and they were very attentive throughout the whole meal.   We started off with dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives (my favorite!) the only problem was that they ran out of them for the second round which was sad.  We promptly got the bread basket and I can not believe how amazing the bread was.  The pretzel roll and the bacon muffin were to die for.  The butter comes out with a rock salt on it (I can not remember what he said it was) but it was so good!!!  I tried not to eat too much b/c I knew we had a big meal but could not help myself.   We then ordered our steaks, I had the Bone-In Ribeye and the Heirloom tomato salad.  The salad was not amazing but good.  The steak on the other hand was perfectly cooked MR and the taste was out of this world.  I have had some amazing steaks in my life and this one is tops!  For sides we shared the au gratin potatoes, truffle corn, and mac & cheese.  I would skip the mac & cheese if I were you and go for something else.  It was good but have had so much better.   I'm not sure what wine we ordered but it was a fabulous cabernet that complimented the steaks perfectly. All throughout the meal James & Jose were fabulous, water glass never empty and the waterfall show was great to see too. Jose recommended the chocolate brownie for dessert and it was perfect!  They even wrote happy birthday on it for me. We also had after dinner drinks and port to go along with the desserts. I would highly recommend going here, it is a splurge but so worth it.  My one major complaint is the back of the stall doors in the women's restroom were pretty gross.  They could use a thorough cleaning!",

What kind of premium service is that for a place as luxurious as SW steakhouse at the Wynn. Our waiter's name is Juan. The other waiter at the table next mine checked on her table through out their meal.",

We got there and realize that no ones made reservation because we both thought each other did it alright. Lucky I just came up and asked and they had room for us 4. We sat down and order a bottle of wine and look over the menu. Me and my girl decided on sharing the ribeye and order a foie gras on the side. Our friends order the tomhawk and the filet. Everything came out just fine but personally my steak was ok. I had more fun w/our company then actually paying attention to dinner. The dinner came out pretty high like $100 each person. Personally I had a great time but it wasn't the food that I was having a great time LOL If I had a chance to do it all again, I would go somewhere else.",

    "text": "This review will be unique because I do not eat beef.  Nevertheless, you can get great quality food and still spend a bundle as a non-steak eater at a steak house.  The SW (Steve Wynn) Steakhouse is located going downstairs from the main floor of the Wynn.  When you enter, you feel a darkness and intimate type atmosphere (Guys, take your ladies here for a good night of food and drinks).    I ordered Tuna Ceviche, Oysters (shared), Scallops on Risotto, and Several Sides (Shared).  To go with the food, we all shared a bottle of a Spanish red wine (cheapest wine bottle is like $98).  The Oysters came out first, and they tasted very fresh.  I am not a big oyster person, but they had a fresh look to them.  The Tuna Ceviche was to die for.  I literally could have ordered 2 orders of that to satisfy my night.  The Scallops on Risottos was okay and nothing fantastic, but it did the trick to help fill me up.  My bill came out to $150 (including tip and tax).  I had a good splurge and early Christmas present to myself.  I think non-steak eaters can manage to have a solid meal here.",

While some restaurants that were at the Wynn have come and gone (Alex, Daniel Boulod, Okada), SW is a staple there. I've dined there when it opens, during the slower times after 2008, and several occasions in recent years - it never disappoints. Great cuts of steak cooked to perfection.  And depending on when you are dining, and where you are seated, you'll be able to enjoy the Lake of Dreams shows while dining (otherwise viewable at Parasol Down).",

    "text": "I took a hiatus from Vegas for about a year, which was both financially and liver health beneficial. I broke the hiatus for a celebration of a college friend's engagement with 11 other Michigan buddies - a worthy cause. I can only do Vegas for two nights, with one of them usually a nice and fun dinner. One of the other guys planed the dinner for Saturday night at SW, the steakhouse in the Wynn resort. We had a great table outside by the water and waterfall, which apparently does little \"shows\" every so often. Our favorite was a giant frog singing Garth Brooks. Funny.  The meal was very good, but the steak was excellent, some of the best I've had in a while. I started with a cesar salad, but it was in a fun presentation. The lettuce was on the left side, lightly dressed, with a drisle of more dressing on the right side of the plate. The table ordered a bunch of sides to share, and my only complaint is that they weren't that large to share. James loved the truffle creamed corn, which was excellent, and I liked the creamed spinach since it wasn't overly creamy. We also had mashed potatoes and a lobster mac 'n cheese.  But the star of the show was the steak, something everyone agreed with. I went with a 9 oz. fillet and it was tasty. They serve the meat with a nice char on the outside, which made each bite nice and salty with a crisp. I made sure to take intermediate bites of sides so that steak would last, but I loved how this was a great fillet that is different that other fillets of similar quality.  SW might not be the best meal in town, but it was very good with some of the best steaks I've had in a while. If you sit outside the scenery is also great.  Everyone had a great time eating and toasting our \"bachelor\", which only led to more fun for the rest of evening.",

The truffle cream corn was so good. The brussel sprouts are all onion so beware of that. The reason for a 3 was service. It was very professional. And good at the start. Prob was our waitress forgot about us. We didnt see her after she took our order. We flagged down someone else for another round of drinks. And to ask for the dessert menu. Which we recieved at 815. At 845, with show tickets for 930 we figured we had no time for dessert based on the fact our server bailed us. I chased her down for the check. Not a single acknowledgement for the lack of service. Just a \"im sorry i got so busy\" woulda raised this score. But when you spend $300 on dinner, you deserve on point service. And SW did NOT provide that. Great view. Good food. Service sucks. Ill take my $ elsewhere next time",

We ordered a lot, I could barely move after the meal and that was with leftovers.   Head about the chile rubbed ribeye for 2...more like for 3. it was HUGE.  Spicy and oh so good. I've had several of my steaks at high end places kicked back to the kitchen because of poor cooking/firing but here the steak was perfect. They gave you SHUN steak knives...it was so good that steak. Tender, juicy and the chile rub was just the perfect spiciness. Loved it.   Sides were good too. Au Gratin, Creamed Spinach and holy crap, the creamed corn with black truffle. So good in fact, my brother started asking how much were black truffles so he could make this at home.   Starters were good too. Big Eye Tuna Cerviche...awesome. Foie Gras Terrine....awesome.  Only miss of the night was the wedge salad. They used a mini-lettuce head..I prefer the traditional wedge. The pork belly was also a bit too thick..I like the bacon crispy and crunch like bacon bits, not like having a slab of pork bacon over the wedge.   But awesome spot. They opened up the window to the waterfall but didn't stay for the show...maybe next time.",

We were seated in the arranged private dining room and I don't even know where to begin on just this room. The interior design of the dining room was beyond anything I've ever seen before. The mirrored walls with dark wood detail on top was delightful.   The dining team did a perfect job taking care of us. The table was landscaped properly, the dining utensils were placed and refreshed timely, and the menu was explained perfectly. The basket of warm, variety breads was served alongside a very delicious butter that is topped with black/white Himalayan salts. I ordered an Iced Tea, which was served delightfully with lemon and sugar. The Iced Tea was flavorful, light, and refreshing. For dinner, I ordered the scallops. The scallops were prepared VERY well and paired with a pea risotto. While the risotto was delicious, it had a distinct flavor that I couldn't identify...it was great, nonetheless.  Although I didn't order a steak, others in our party were raving about the ribeye and filet.   I will absolutely be back and look forward to dining in the patio area by the lake!",

We were sat in a corner facing the dining room which was excellent for people watching! We were greeted in a timely manner and the wine lists were dropped.  I wish they had more wines by the glass but I found something to drink anyways. I was no carbing but my best friend was RAVING about their Bacon bread , one of the best things on creation!   I love the menu because it has variations of what you would normally see at most nice steak houses but they have \"additions\" or a topping on your steak for the additional cost. I think that set them different from all the rest!! The additions were foie gras ( OMG I was all over that!), scampi, Oscar, I can't remember the others but did I mention foie gras ?! Lol my friend and I had the beef carpaccio with toast points and baked parm and crab cake for apps. Both good but have had better crab cakes. For our entrees we shared the bone in rib eye with foie gras and shrimp scampi addition, scallops, Caesar salad (I asked for no croutons so they gave me baked parm, thought that was a nice touch) pork belly with Brussel sprouts ( wow so good!), and lobster mac and cheese. The funny part was we had a very small table but it all managed to fit with the Bacon bread ! Lol  Overall, it was awesome. The servers were nice, the second server knew we were foodies so asked us our favorite restaurants etc. Very nice conversation. We sat there for almost 3 hours and never felt rushed. Oh, since I was in Vegas after all, I saw Brock Lesnar there too. Can't really miss him lol  It was a great experience and I will go there again!!!!",

Everything about this restaurant is top notch. The decor is stunning and elegant.  Service was friendly, attentive and prompt. They provide pretzels, bread and cheese&bacon muffins to start - the pretzels are delicious!  We ordered two 16 ounce New York Steaks (cooked to perfection), the potato puree and the asparagus. Everything was amazing! The steaks are pricey but the portions are huge!  We requested patio dinning but since we didn't make reservations we were seated inside instead which was still great because we could see the Lake of Dreams from inside and still had a view of the occasional show.  After dinner we asked the hostess if she would take a quick picture, but she insisted we take a picture outside with the view. She really went above and beyond our request, she was really great!",

This is really the cream of the crop of fine dining steakhouses.  They sat us out on the patio and though it was kind of cold in November, their heatlamps were on overtime and it actually felt comfortable sitting out there, not to mention how incredibly beautiful it was.  The restaurant was very busy, but we never wanted for anything.    We each ordered salads, soup, steak and lobster and a couple martinis.  They gave us a complimentary glass of champagne. We also ordered a dessert even though we wanted to explode from eating WAY too much food.  The service was just amazing.  Our server Tim was the SHIET!  They timed the food perfectly so that we were never waiting for anything and nothing was brought out too early.  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  It was truly so much food, but we wanted to splurge.  SW is an example of you getting what you pay for because it is NOT cheap.  It is definitely on the more expensive side for the list of awesome steakhouses on the Strip.  However, it is more than 100% guaranteed that you will be FLOORED by the amazing food, ambiance, and service.  We felt absolutely pampered.  If you are willing to spend the money for an amazing dining experience, I highly recommend SW.  I can't wait until the next big occasion to get the bf to take ME this time.",

The service was impeccable and the lake show was definitely entertaining. The wine and drink list was excellent. For the $$ I'm not sure I'd do it again though.",

Even talked me into the ribeye instead of the tomahawk because the marble rating was higher.   The bread basket they dropped of was unreal loaded with pretzel bread, bacon potato bread and sour dough bread with a side of addicting black sea salt and olive oil butter.  Then they delivered the fresh roasted corn soup. They set a bowl of pipping hot roasted corn, jalapeno and cilantro.  Then they poured the broth into the bowl. Boom, the best soup I've ever had.   The Caesar salad was good but steakhouse average, I would order it again tho but I love almost all Caesar salads.   Then the feast began, with sides of jumbo grilled asparagus, black truffle cream corn, grilled onion and jalapenos, and a baked potato the size of my arm. Every last one of them a home run.   Entrees were roasted chicken and the best cowboy ribeye I've ever had. So soft, juicy and marbly. Plated with a couple of grilled scallops dropped in some spicy risotto.   We didn't order desert because we were too full but they delivered a little anniversary plate with cookies on it.   We had dinner reservations at 5:30 and around 7 they opened up the windows to the patio which was amazing. They also started a little show on the waterfall wall.   This place is a 10+ in my book and I don't give out 10s.",

The bar staff makes great drinks, the wine list is incredible. The frog show and the setting is unique to the Vegas strip and adds to the fun experience.  Go to see Reve after dinner for a great night at the Wynn. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

My boyfriend and I dined at SW last night per the recommendation of a close friend. We were a bit early for our reservation, but they were incredibly accommodating and sat us shortly after arriving. The only thing that topped the food was the service.   We'll start with the food: I ordered the scallops. They were perfectly seared and served over the most delicious sweet pea risotto with a truffle oil drizzle. Holy Moses, they were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the salmon, which has a bit of an Indian curry flavor. Curry isn't my favorite, but the salmon itself was delightful.   The wine: our server recommended a Russian River Valley Pinot noir that was sheer perfection. We aren't big drinkers but wanted to enjoy wine with dinner so our server split a pour between us.   The service: Ken is a rockstar!!! He is observant, pleasant, knowledgeable, and damn good at his job. He spent time chatting with us but was never an imposition. His dinner and wine recommendations were spot-on. And when some truffle oil escaped from a fork and landed on my guy's jeans, Ken noticed us dabbing at it with a linen; he dropped off a glass of club soda without us having to say a word.   Overall: this place gets an A+ from us!",

    "text": "Let's face it...in Las Vegas there are endless dining options. Some good, some bad...some cheap, & some err not so cheap. On the aforementioned scale, SW Steakhouse would fall under \"decent but pricey\". Would I go back? ...if I was stuck down at the far end of the strip and didn't feel like leaving the hotel I would go back but there are just better options in Vegas.   On my most recent trip to Las Vegas we decided to stay at the Wynn (a lovely property which will be separately reviewed). I originally had reservations for Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris but that ended up not working out so I decided to try one of the restaurants in the hotel (which made more sense since I had tickets to XS that evening anyway).   The restaurant itself is located in the front on the lower level. They were fully booked so my friend and I decided to \"walk in\". We were able to snag seats at the bar. I had a vodka martini which considering the price tag was just OK. To start we had oysters and I ordered the King Crab Soup which came crowned with a giant crouton thing (see photo). The soup itself wasn't particularly exciting and the tomato flavor of the broth/base overpowered any crab that was in there. For my main course I had the filet (rare) and we split the poblano & smoked bacon mac n' cheese. The mac n' cheese was the standout of the meal and I really enjoyed the flavors that came out of what would normally be a boring side; the bacon added a really nice texture. The filet was...typical for what you'd find at any high end steakhouse. It was cooked properly (rare), and I'd say it's on par with Mastro's...was it worth the Vegas premium? I would say no. My benchmark has always been Ruth's Chris (I know I'm biased) and I could have gotten a larger filet at Ruth's for less money. I will give SW points for the butter on the side lol. We skipped dessert, the bill was what you'd expect for a Vegas steakhouse attached to a resort. Overall I give it a 3 star rating...if I could do 3.5 I'd give it an extra .5 for the ambiance as the restaurant is quite nice. Will i be back? Maybe...but with so many options in Vegas it might be a while before I repeat.",

SW books weeks if not months in advice so I suggest you make your reservations well in advance so you can actually get in. The food is absolutely amazing, while I got the crab pasta I had friends that got steaks all with no complaints. The appetizers are fantastic and really nothing like I have ever had before.Make sure to order an appetizer and sides even if you don't normally it's just one of those things you have to try if you are visiting. The cream corn I can't even describe, it's so good it just melts in your mouth. I had the fornicate experience of being able to eat outside on a beautiful Las Vegas night by the waterfall. The environment is really nothing else like I have ever seen. They have entertainment in the pond which sits alongside the restaurant. I think SW is just one of those things you should experience while staying in Las Vegas. The service was great, the found I can't even really describe and it's just something that you should do. They also have a great wine selection on top of the food being fantastic.  If you are in Las Vegas and looking for a high end dinner experience look no further than SW Steakhouse at the Wynn. All of the food was fantastic and I will certainly visit again!",

It's an incredible space, high ceilings, great decor and oh yeah, there's a big lake and a light show outside the window.  Nice!  Oh, and I guess I should mention that there is an array of supermodel looking women who could not possibly be eating the steaks roaming about.  Next, I want to talk about the cocktails.  The bartenders here are real pros.  They do an excellent job crafting their drinks.  Go old school and drink what your grandfather would have drank here.  The food is wonderful.  I would rank Strip Steak higher, but by no means should you take that as a signal to bypass SW Steakhouse.  Just go to Strip Steak one night and then SW Steakhouse the next :-)  The steaks are cooked perfectly.  They come with a selection of three sauces.  Try the tropical jalapeno once just to see if you like it.  It wasn't for me, but they have a delightful bernaise and a surprisingly good steak sauce as an alternative.  The sides I've had there are excellent.  I can't speak to the desserts because I typically go right to the extensive selection of fine scotches after dinner.    So there you have it.  Steve Wynn just does stuff right again.",

The tomahawk steak, although pricey at $78 was one of the best steaks I have ever tasted.  It was perfectly seared and charred on the outside and medium rare 127 degrees on the inside.  Yes, really, 127. I've been to Cut, Mastro's, Morton's, RC, Flemings (gross) and besides Peter Luger in NY, this was the best single steak I've ever had.",

    "text": "I recently went to SW Steakhouse @ Wynn for a client dinner. Our party of about ten had a really enjoyable dinner. The menu includes, but goes beyond, typical steakhouse fare.   Although most members of the group stuck to traditional offerings (lots of filet mignon - boring!), I went my own way and ordered the braised \"Kobe style beef short ribs\" for my main, preceded by a salad of green and white asparagus with quail egg, frisee and truffle viniagrette. I also ordered a side of truffled cream corn. In short, truffles for miles.  The short ribs were terrific. Wonderful flavor and as tender as one would expect of the preparation. The meat was lightly coated in an Asian-style glaze that had only the tiniest hint of sweetness. Perfect. The dish was accompanied by truffled pomme puree (amazing) and root vegetables that in my wine-induced haze, I completely overlooked. While I loved the flavor of the creamed corn, there were bits of husk and corn silk mixed in that I could have done without.  Unfortunately we didn't get to sample desserts. Our host very sneakily procured the check and asked us to join him one of his hospitality suites. They had an ice cream bar set up, but during the walk over there, my dinner caught up with me and I was too full for a sundae.  The scene at SW was pretty fun given that the Olympic Men's Basketball Team was staying at the Wynn while in training. As we walked in, we were greeted by Kobe Bryant and family, and during the meal, lots of other players stopped by to great our group which, with one active player and two NBA legends, wasn't too shabby.    I have no idea how many bottles of wine we drank, or even what the red was (the white was a Sancerre...details have been forgotten if ever known), but I would put it somewhere around two bottles per person. When I had an after drinner drink with my mentor (who lives in Vegas) at the nearby Country Club Bar and he spilled port on my new cream colored dress, I was so tipsy that I [almost] didn't care. I do now.    Note: dinner only; reservations suggested.",

I actually, ready for this...hold on for the shock ...spent $180 on a steak. Not a steak to share with a party of four, but A steak. Now I know what you're thinking...5 stars a $180 steak, I must hear more...and you shall.  I have eaten at SW a few times now and never once even come close to JUST happy. I have always left ecstatic! The $180 steak was a True Wagyu Kobe beef steak and something that still brings tears to my eyes every time I think of it. The wine list is incredible and the deserts are out of this world. If you go when its not too hot they have a killer patio over a giant pond that spits out an occasional light show. While we were there the chef made the rounds and asked how the $180 steak was...did I tell you I paid $180 for a steak and was OK with it?  To top the night off, there was a bachlor party of some kind in a private room in the back. At one point during the meal a Korean man came running through the restaurant with a bikini brief a hat with his clothes in his arms...and nobody looked twice.  That;s why I love VEGAS!!!!!",

    "text": "First off, the complimentary bacon and cheese bread was excellent. I always judge a restaurant by their bread, and it was not a disappointment. The bacon provided a nice salt contrast to the cheese.  We ordered:  Tuna Ceviche for the Appetizer - This was one of the best ceviche's i've ever had. The tuna was ridiculously fresh and it comes with sesame rice crackers and some sort of green sauce. Definitely a great appetizer to start a meal  Bone In Ribeye Steak - I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out the way I ordered. The crust was perfectly charred. While not the greatest steak ever, it was still a good piece of meat. I can say that it needed just a tad bit more seasoning. I still think Ruth Chris' ribeye is still the best steak I've ever eaten. It might be the butter.   Lobster Mac N Cheese - This was the letdown of the entire meal. The cheese sauce wasn't creamy enough, which led to an odd texture.  Potatoes Au Gratin - One of the stars of the meal. Anyone who eats here must order this. Really delicious.  Foie Gras - This was the first time eating foie gras, but wow, this piece of duck liver was delicious. I kept thinking to myself what my own liver would taste like (probably pretty terrible since I'm partying every weekend). The liver was pan seared and when you bite it into, it just melts in your mouth and leaves this strange, but great flavor after the bite.",

    "text": "Steve Wynn's Steakhouse is the best steakhouse I've been to in Vegas. Matter of fact it's probably one of the best Steakhouses I've been to period. Im no noob steakhouse diner either, I've been to 8 outta the 12 steakhouses that yelp list when you type steakhouse in las vegas.Imma heavy meateater, and love me some good juicy flavorful steaks. Even after starting off the night in a sour mood, once the food arrived, I gotta say we were all happy campers and the taste was amazing. Starting off with the bread, that preztel bread and bacon something muffin bread, wow. The king crab soup wasn't great but still good, kinda tasted like a minestrone soup with a tiny bit of crab meat. It  did come with a puff pastry that did go really well with the soup. For the sides we had, the potatoe puree, the asparagus, the black truffle cream corn, wild mushroom, bacon mac n cheese, and brussel sprouts. I personally didn't think the truffle and creamed corn mixed well but my friends absolutely loved it. To me, the sides were my least favorite part as all the sides were good but not memorable. Now on to what makes SW one of the best steakhouses.....I've ever tried. I got a simple new york strip cooked medium well. Came perfectly charred on the outside with a pink center for the entire steak. Probably should've got a medium but never the less, it was delicious. The steak itself had great flavor with a bit of crusted salt layered on top. Now if that wasn't enough to get your palettes roaring in excitement,  it comes with the most delicious butter thing-a-jig kinda sauce you have ever tried. I believe they said it was some kinda kobe fat based buttersauce. Rub a little on your steak, and you'll be absolutely blown away. Steve Wynn's Steakhouse for the WIN! Damn, this experience has spoiled me now, I have to find a place like this in LA. Mastro's just won't do anymore. Until next time Vegas, this was quite an experience.",

My husband was looking forward to eating here, and we were a bit disappointed.  The food was good; my steak was excellent, the potatoes and breads were VERY salty, and my husband's salmon was just okay.  Our table was horribly located in the very front of the restaurant next to the reception desk.  Our table had a constant, heavy \"breeze\" coming from the front door.  Before we were even seated my husband asked if there was another table available and was given a simple, \"no.\"  I understand that other people have reservations too, however, several tables were empty the entire time that we were there.  In order to not be so annoyed, I just kept saying that the breeze was like eating outside.  In our opinion, this entire experience was definitely NOT worth the $250 check!",

While the Wynn prides itself on excellence on everything they do it failed us last night with our dinner experience at SW steakhouse. We ate there before and the food and the service were always great; however , last night we had a really bad experience with the service. The waiter was unfriendly and seemed that he just did not want to be there. He took our orders and disappear for half hour. We wanted to order more drinks but no server was coming to our table. When we asked for our waiter he came back with an attitude. My mother in law asked him why he hasn't checked up on us his response was \"what do you want me to do, grab a chair and sit next to you\". We were chocked at his response. We called the manager to complain but he wasn't any better either. He did not apologize for the waiter's behavior or showed any interest in rectifying the situation. He just offered us a different waiter for our table. However that did not happen either and we had to deal with the same waiter for the rest of our meal. There are many dining options in Vegas and no one needs to put up with a horrible treatment like this. Good by SW.",

Here's the scoop on why I award them a 4.0 GPA:  + Seating was very quick, but I recommend making a reservation because this place is uber popular.  + The servers were right on key with EVERYTHING. You definitely get what you pay for. The management here really keep the ambiance and experience top notch with every aspect of the meal. For example, my ice tea (not a big drinker obviously) was always filled. My colleague's 1/2 bottle of wine was poured perfectly + All the food came out in a timely manner! Very important especially when there's multiple guests in your party.  + Our servers were very professional, but funny. Their humor felt real and I felt a good connection with them.  + The food was absolutely excellent: veal (scrumptious and tender with the bone in...) Thanks to SW, I've found my favorite food of all time. crab soup was filling and was presented in a artful way, making it better tasting!  + For me, it's all about the bathroom, but at SW, they gave us this dessert that lifted my spirits so high! Sounds corny, but damn, I was hella happy. I saw in the corner of my eye this dessert structure of mini funnel cakes on a mini tree lined with fat strawberries and 3 dipping sauces. I seriously hope I'm this happy when I get married.   Lastly, know that you're paying for excellence here so don't be surprised. If you have it in your budget to have dinner here, I highly recommend it. And don't forget to try that dessert. Maybe you'll be as happy as I was.",

    "text": "Had one of the best steaks of all time tonight at SW at Wynn.  I have been to too many steak houses that just can't cook the steak the way i request it to be cooked.  I always tell the waiter I want a medium- well steak.  Almost 9 out of 10 times, they bring it medium rare to the point the meat is still red in the middle.  The end result is I have to tell the waiter to take it back and then they grill it some more, which takes away the quality.  This was not the case at SW.  I had a bone in rib eye that was cooked to perfection and tasted absolutely fabulous.  We also got Steve's salad which has a nice assortment of vegetables and tasty dressing.  Not your typical house salad with generic house dressing.  The atmosphere is very upscale and sophisticated.  I was going to take a star off for one reason.  I needed 4 refills of coke.  3 out of the 4 times, my glass sat on the table empty for an avg. of 5 min.  I know at these high end restaurants this is one of the things that should not happen.  There were plenty of guys running around to see this and the joint wasn't super busy.  I was there for a birthday dinner date.  They brought out a plate with one candle and two pieces of tiny chocolate mints that said \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate.  Better than nothing, I guess.  To sum it up, the steaks made this place.  Not cheap by any means... The rib eye and filet were an avg of $60.  The portion was perfect.",

Hostess said no that they \"save those seats for guests who make reservations the furthest in advance.\" Well after sitting and watching who got seats by the fountain it was clear it was determined by demographics alone. Two of the best tables remained empty the entire time we were there. So if you are an older couple dressed in formal wear you will get outstanding service.

Also, the portion was so huge that neither of us could finish it in order to save room for the main course.

Now to some bulleted points.   - Arrived a few minutes late but called 30 minutes in advance to let them know - Also let them know it was a bday dinner for my husband (we'll get to that later) and planned an outside table in advance  - Got there and we had to wait nearly 30-35 minutes regardless of our reservations - Many people waiting looked very upset and at least 10 people that I could recall were deeply angered (some actually left and voiced their opinion before leaving)  - We were polite and asked of the wait time, but received a snappy remark from what appears to be the GM - Front desk ladies were all stoic and did not smile much - very rude and unwelcoming with their sharp answers - GM to the front desk did not even acknowledge your presence (could have easily stated \"we're very busy and running behind tonight so we do apologize for any of the inconveniences. as you wait, please have some complimentary bread or drinks for the inconvenience.\" - DONE!) - It was hard hearing how the GM was talking to some of the other patrons  - The GM clearly changed his tune when people came in that he knew - we get Vegas is about who you know and if you are affluent, it pays - However, don't be rude to the other guests that are collectively made of doctors to business owners as well - money spent is still money spent regardless of who it is coming from - It was my husband's birthday and at the end of the dinner, although we were stuffed, we got two chocolate pieces with a candle on it. Really? No cake even though we would not eaten it? We ordered a bottle of wine and spent over $300. No $5 cake? It's the principle honestly   We didn't get the outside seating of course and the front desk experience really got to us. Instead of saying how great the food was, we remembered how horrid and absent the customer service was in the front. The Asian lady just did not look like she wanted to be there that night and it showed.   To Management and Steve Wynn - maybe you could improve the operations and have people smile. We come frequently, however, there are patrons that save a lot of money and make this a special occasion. It was hard to stomach watching nice people just walking away when the GM was very snappy and the front desk looked unapproachable. This was my favorite steak restaurant that I HAD to go on each visit, but now, it appears that the customer service up front has ruined what the servers worked hard to achieve. Management should ask the employees on what makes exceptional customer service.   Just my two cents.",

    "text": "Have you ever had a meal so perfect that you'll remember it forever?  I did recently; it was at the SW Steakhouse at the Wynn.  Here's the story:  The two of us knew we wanted one splurge-worthy, special-occasion dinner during our brief time in Vegas.  After some online research and comparison shopping of locales and menus, we decided that SW Steakhouse was the right choice.  (Michelle C.'s review was the clincher.)  The word on the grapevine was that Steve Wynn's namesake restaurant is notoriously difficult to snag reservations for, so we called ~2 weeks in advance to make reservations for 9:00pm on a Sunday night.  On the phone, the hostess was incredibly gracious, making sure we had just the seats we wanted.  She even inquired about any special occasions we might be having.    Flash forward two weeks -- and dinner has finally arrived!  As we entered the SW Steakhouse, we were immediately struck by the decor.  Elegant, sleek, and modern, but also warm and inviting, situated right on the edge of the lake.  When we made our reservation, we asked for a view of the waterfall outside, and that's exactly what the hostess delivered.  The tables were spaced far apart, so we had plency of privacy, even though the restaurant was full.  First up: the bread basket.  The most decadent assortment I've enjoyed.  The French baguette was lovely; so was the soft pretzel.  But the bacon cheddar biscuits were orgasmic.  So savory, so decadent, so perfect.  Second: big-eye tuna ceviche.  Easily the freshest and most flavorful ceviche that has graced my lips.  The tuna was so delicate and smooth -- like butter.  The mango and grapefruit gave it an acidic kick.  The avocado cream and sesame crackers were the perfect accompaniment.  My main course: Hawaiian swordfish.  Stellar.  The sear on the swordfish was to die for.  So was the toasted pasta, whose delicate flavor and texture practically danced on my tongue.  It came with such fragrant tomato broth that I could drink cupfuls of if I had the opportunity.  My dinner companion's main course: New York strip steak.  First of all, let me confess that I'm not much of a red meat person.  I almost never eat steak.  However, when I tasted SW's strip steak, I was overjoyed.  The thick, spicy crust on this steak was completely unlike any other steak I've had.  In a city overrun with overpriced steak joints of questionable quality, SW is a diamond in the rough.  These steaks are too heavenly to pass up.  The side dish: au gratin potatoes.  Once again, SW takes a traditional dish and makes it extraordinary.  The creaminess of these potatoes was in a league of its own.    Dinner was leisurely, which was just the way food like this is meant to be savored.  We probably spent 3 or so hours here.  After we each selected a couple glasses of wine to sip (Sauvignon blanc for me, Zinfandel for my dinner companion), whiling away the time became easy.  Our server was so gentlemanly and kind -- never did he make us feel rushed.  His service was the final outstanding piece to the delicious puzzle that was dining at the SW Steakhouse.  Dinner at SW Steakhouse isn't cheap, but the quality was worth it.  I can't dine like this everyday, but I secretly wish I could.  My compliments to the chef and amazing staff of the SW Steakhouse -- when I said I'd remember this dinner forever, I meant it.    I can't wait to be back.",

Their wine selection is huge varying in price from $100 to thousands. We will definitely go back on our next visit to Vegas.",

This year was my 30th birthday so I decided to pick the renowned SW steakhouse because I didn't want anything to go wrong.   I had requested the porch because I wanted to watch the shows on the lake. We were placed in a great table with a wonderful view.  The service was good but was not as attentive as you would expect for such an established and well known Steakhouse with Wynns name on it. Staff took a long time to come around to take orders, and was not very knowledgable of the food. Didn't feel as special as expected  from a establish of this level.   The food on the other hand was amazing. Everything we ordered from soups to steaks was unbelievable.   ATTENTION !! If it wasn't for the food being so great I would of rated this restaurant a 1. Once I got done eating an amazing meal I was engulfed in cigarette smoke. The table behind me all started smoking and ruined the entire experience. I asked the waiter if he could tell them to put it out and he said he could not. It was really sad to end such a great meal in such a bad way. Food was amazing but everything else sub par.",

I actually considered changing our reservations for this reason and I'm so glad I didn't.     Our waitstaff team was excellent, friendly but not intrusive and very helpful.   I keep reading on complaints about the pricing?  Let me remind you that you are eating at the Wynn.  At their signature steakhouse.  You were expecting what exactly?   SW is a spectacular restaurant with excellent food, service and beautiful decor.   My only complaint is that they don't offer group dining for anymore than 20-25 people.  I would have easily chosen this for my rehearsal or wedding reception dinner.",

I didn't partake in any of the appetizers but they looked good, was holding out for the main course.  I went with the 9 ounce filet mignon butterflied and it was the best filet I've ever had.  Came with some herb butter which was a great compliment. Sides we got were creamed corn, asparagus, mushrooms and a gnocchi special.  All amazing but the creamed corn was on another level, so delicious.  Finally got the cookie butter cheesecake which the waiter kindly suggested, absolutely amazing.  The place isn't cheap but you get your money's worth and then some.  If you can try to get a seat where you see the water light show they have by the restaurant, very cool show! Will be back next time Im in Vegas!",

There were always several bussers and water fillers on hand and came at appropriate times to service the table.  The room is also very modern with high ceilings and large windows which look out to a patio and waterfall.  Needless to say my expectations weren't completely fulfilled dining here.  I was surprised at not the biggest selection of cuts (maybe 4) for a establishment specializing in steak.  My rib eye was seasoned very well but I wasn't given as much of a kick of flavor as I hoped for.  As any typical steakhouse, the sides were expensive and small.  I was really impressed with the dessert selection and I noticed other tables ordering some very creative things for their large groups!  Needless to say it wasn't bad, but in my opinion not completely worth the price.  With so many other options in Las Vegas, I would most likely spend my dollar elsewhere.",

    "text": "The food is way overrated. The ambiance, patio, service, decor, and drinks are fantastic, and the shows on the lake are bizarre, I loved them.  The staff were very accommodating as our party went from 4 to 6 to 7 to 6. We asked for and received awesome patio seating in VERY uncomfortable patio chairs. Note to management: get some cushions for those chair backs!   The server was well trained, as were all of the staff. Didn't love the description of what makes beef Kobe, but she didn't hedge with the info and I give her credit for that. Her \"I don't mind, I'm not doing it to the animals\" was a little snarky, but that's ok.   I was surprised that the only grass-fed beef option was a special. I would assume they'd have had more options.   The staff were flexible with our late-comer who I was ordering for ahead of time, and were concerned about when to start his food; they came up with a plan for that, which was very kind.   The patio is great, especially on a beautiful night like we had. The interior is really beautiful, in a very simple, modern way. Very comfortable looking, while maintaining sophistication.   But back to the food--it was fine. My scallops were good though overpriced, everyone's dinners were fine; no complaining, but no raving at all. And this is a food-raving bunch when it's warranted.   There was nothing special about the scallops, the risotto under, or the grass-fed NY strip. The asparagus was fine, the scalloped potatoes were too much goo and not enough potato, and I'd say the only to-die-for item on the table were the sauteed mushrooms. They were heavenly--but with enough butter, anyone can make heavenly mushrooms.  My bottomline: Won't be back here. We'll try Morels or Del Monico's at the Venetian next time, or continue on our hunt for A++++ restaurants at $$ prices. Because that's when something is really special!",

Everyone in my group wished we ate there the last night of our trip, so we wouldn't have to compare everything else to SW!!  The ambiance is simply incomparable to any other restaurant. When we went, there was a light show and really cute entertainment (a giant frog popped above the waterfall and sang, with lyrics projected over the water to sing-along).  The food was great! If you're a big steak eater, I would definitely recommend the porter house. If not, the lobster tail is delicious. And OMG, that bread is to die for (there was a cheddar bacon bread, pretzel bread, and one other that I didn't try). The best bread of my life! It is freshly baked and comes out warm to your table :). Also, the oyster appetizer is bomb.   Dining experiences are never going to be perfect, especially when there are a lot of people at the restaurant. Mistakes will happen now and again. The mark of a great restaurant is how you handle those mistakes. When someone in my party got a vodka-based drink instead of the gin one they ordered, and when someone's risotto was a bit over-salted, our server was on it! He immediately brought back the correct drink, made jokes, and even took the risotto off our bill.   If you're coming to Vegas, dine here! It' expensive but worth it.",

The biggest complaint is that the steaks and sides seemed overseasoned. Everything was salty. It's too bad, because the quality of the meat was outstanding. And I'm not going to lie, I finished my ribeye as it was tender and good, but the salty taste kind of ruined it for me. My wife did not finish her filet and all of our sides had leftovers.   I also thought that the service was good but a little overwhelming. Our server kept trying to upsell us on wine and would come around almost too frequently to check on us. He bordered on annoying.   Combine all that with what was a nearly $500 check for four people (with wine) and I left feeling a little underwhelmed.   I will say that the ambience at SW is five stars. Just an amazing experience sitting outside on the Lake of Dreams and watching all of the shows that Wynn puts on. If you do decide to dine at SW, ask to sit on the patio.  Also, the bread they serve before dinner is really great. I might walk down there and slip someone a 5 for some of those bacon cheese rolls and pretzel bread.   Just not sure if I'll have that bread before dinner there again anytime soon.",

I had never had chopped brussel spouts- I wasn't a huge fan but it was more me than them not nailing it. The au gratin potatoes were delish.

    "text": "Btw they responded to this review and someone from management was suppose to contact me and never did. Just like the service it's a disappointment. Lies all around!!! Lies!!!  From Aug 2016! Cheap etiquette, horrible customer service, overly salty steak, under quality less than average restaurant!   Not sure if Vegas falling under the economy but this restaurant does not do justice. It's prob the worst dinning experience I've ever had in Vegas. We went with a party of 5 and my friends 9 year old son was wearing shorts. The host informed us that we need to get him pants and they had loners there. My friends son did not want to wear someone else's pants, therefore we had to buy him some pants hence the shops at the Wynn is not the average mall shops.   We went to Givenchy and his dad spent 3k to get him pants and some dress shoes. So this would prove to u how excited we were to dine at SW.   Finally we are the restaurant again, the waiter did not give us any formal greeting, he basically gave us our menus and asked if we were ready. No big deal, we were extremely hungry so that did not bother us.  We ordered a round of drinks, water and our main entrees. Everyone had the filet minion and about 5 sides in total for the table. We were anticipating on the steaks only to be extremely disappointed.!!!!! We all got our filets and it was so salty that it was hard to consume. As hungry as we were it was hard to eat. We all asked each other If the steak is too salty and everyone said yes without hesitation but didn't want to ruin the experience so after one confessed that it's hard to take another bite we finally decided to get the waiter.   The waiter did not apologize, he said I will go get my manager and be right back. My boyfriend told the waiter even before he went to get the manager that we were not looking for any discounts bc no one had taken more than 3 bites. So we waited for the manager to come and see he what could possibly do so that we weren't chewing on grams of salt.  The manager never came by. We did not hear from the waiter, we waited over 1 hour to see if we can get the steaks made so we just ate the side dishes and agreed that this restaurant has no integrity, they have cheap mannerism, horrible customer service and simply just rude and to top it off saying the food is mediocre is an overstatement.   We watched the waiter finally come by and he said he was going to comp the dessert lol we ordered 1 dessert for 5 people just to let them know that it was the classless act of not being hospitable and at the very least having the manager with his sharp suit walking around looking on the mirrors had better things to do than to stop by and at the very least apologize. He needs to be fired on the spot.   The staff needs to come to LA and learn a thing or two from restaurants so they wouldn't have cheap etiquette. Stay away from this restaurant if u love your steak and like customer service find STK @ the Cosmo at least u will treated decently.",

    "text": "Came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. We had reservation there at 7:30PM and we were promptly seated. We ordered Fillet Mignon, Boneless Rib eye, Mac & Cheese, kale salad(I forgot what that was, but it comes with amazing pecan), and shrimp cocktail. We had bread as an appetizer, and that bacon and cheese bread was the killer. It really was the best bread I've ever had as an appetizer. Server was really nice, had everything we needed.   Shrimp Cocktail : I am not big fan of seafood (but my girl do), since she enjoyed it, I would not deduct any point based upon this.  Kale Salad : Salad was amazing and maybe next time, I will be here just to have this salad. Trust me, it is that good. Coated pecan harmonized with the dressing and salad, which really  was amazing  Fillet Mignon : Again, best fillet I've ever had, never had as tender fillet as the one in SW.  Boneless Rib Eye : Amazingly juicy from the beginning, but I would not give rib eye by itself as 5 out of 5. I understand that Rib Eye comes with some fat part, but the steak that I had, it was too fatty. Also, by the time that I was eating, I could tell that it was getting dried. It was never been juicy at the end.  Mac & Cheese : 1 star out of 5. Nothing special, too hot to eat, cheese did not go well with mac. To be honest, I was disappointed about their Mac & Cheese, but I would say, I just made my menu selection wrongly. Should not have ordered this.  Overall experience, I had great time. There were some waterfall show that were going on also, which was pretty romantic. But if I have to compare this place with my past experience that I had in STK, I would say I had better experience in STK. Better side dish, as good steak as SW, amazingly friendly and attentive server,  better atmosphere with lighting (I am still young).",

I wish I won a million bucks, but that didn't happen during my mini getaway. Instead, my amazing husband managed to get a last minute outside seating at SW. Don't ask how, I won't tell.  To my surprise, I had no idea how wonderful SW was until the outside \"show\" began. A giant green frog appeared from behind the massive waterfall and began to sing a lovely tune. The next show was two orbs singing and dancing in the pool with a little surprise at the end.  I enjoyed my time at SW, it's an experience and a must go to restaurant during a Vegas stay (outside seating is mandatory!)",

    "text": "We came here for a birthday dinner and were really excited to try the steakhouse.  The ambiance is very elegant and the noise level appropriate.  The pretzel bread was delicious.  The butter was fresh and if you missed it, the olive oil the butter is sitting on, is delicious.  This was a nice start.  The large group ordered different types of steaks, meats, etc.  I had the truffle risotto.  We also did a family style order of sides: Yukon Gold potato puree, steak fries, Cipollini Onions & Jalapeno, Sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Shaved Brussels Sprouts.    The food was delicious.  We may have ordered too much.  The truffle risotto was delicate and the cauliflower added a similar yet unique texture.   The food itself was excellent.  I removed 2 stars due to the service.  This was a special event and the waiter argued with the guest of honor on how to serve his drink.  He seemed grumpy after that.  After our meals were served, our service significantly declined.  Our waiter was not to be seen (if you're on break, let us know or give a replacement).  We couldn't ask for the bill so we sat there.  The bill came 20 minutes after we were done with our meal.    I really enjoyed the food and for an expensive restaurant, the service was sub par.  This is something I've seen at other Encore restaurants and I feel management needs to step it up.  I would want the truffle risotto again but I'm sure I can find it another restaurant.",

    "text": "A and I came with another couple and we've been to the only restaurant in New York that serves real kobe beef so we were excited to come and try this place, which is one of two places only in Las Vegas that serves it. We originally had reservations at Jose Andres Bazaar Meat but decided last minute to change it to here since it was closer in location to us and was also fully booked, which we thought meant it must be better. The pricing is actually higher than New York's but unfortunately, the kobe beef didn't taste as amazingly delicious as we hoped. We all felt we've had better. We tried 4 oz of the rib cap, which is one of the cuts that has the most marbling. In addition to this, we split the 40 oz dry aged steak, filet mignon, SW fries, creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, and crispy potato rosti. The steaks and sides were all very good, as were the complimentary bread basket - I ate too much of the bacon cheese roll and pretzel roll. The fries were especially good but we were so full, we barely made a dent in them and we ordered all the sides in half portions too with the exception of the rosti.",

    "text": "I hate to do this, but I must.  First let me say that some of the following review may have just been bad luck for us.  But at the same time, it was our entire experience, so here we go.  I'll do a brief summary, and then you can read the rest in detail if you still want to know more.  First of, let me say that my Wife and I have always tried to make a trip to SW part of any trip to Las Vegas for the past 10 years or so.  They lost our reservation, and we had to re-book for another night.  MINUS ONE STAR...  The Restaurant was incredibly loud on a Monday night...it was a strain to talk among ourselves at the table it was so loud.  MINUS ONE STAR..  Our Table was tucked away in a corner, with absolutely no view of the 'Lake of Dreams' show, which is part of what helps to separate SW from every other Steak House on the Strip.  MINUS ONE STAR...  Corkage Policy, I dare you to try and find it posted anywhere on their website.  Let me save you the trouble...100 dollars per bottle.    MINUS ONE STAR...  The Full Story of our experience:   I had called and booked a table for our group two weeks prior to our visit.  I called the night before to confirm, but they had no record of us.  We were able to re-book for the following night for our party, which while not ideal, would still work for us.  ***MINUS ONE STAR***  So two days later we arrive on time, and have a short wait to be seated.  The restaurant was packed and seemed far louder than we have ever experienced before.  It's never been quiet, but this seemed extreme.  The Signature SW cocktails are now over 20 bucks each, (our group had a Manhattan and pair of Martini's) and honestly while prepared well, did not provide the sort of experience their price tag would justify.  We were then seated in a far corner of the restaurant, behind a pillar with no view of the 'Lake of Dreams' water show, which has always been part of made dining at SW so great.  And it was LOUD.  So loud that we all struggled to hear one another, really destroying the atmosphere.  I don't know if it was the location of our table, or the if they have added more tables into the space, but after an hour of our dinner, I was starting to get a headache from the noise.  ***MINUS TWO STARS*** (One for no view, one for the noise)  Backing up, this was special evening for the other couple with us (anniversary) and we brought a couple of amazing bottles from our private collections to help celebrate the moment.  As we're being seated, the Hostess asked if we knew they had a corkage policy, I said yes, we've had many bottles here in the past.  I'd like to make a point here...Nowhere on the SW Website, do they list the current corkage policy.  It turns out, they currently charge ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS per bottle.  We discovered that when the bill came.  I don't begrudge restaurants charging corkage, as a wine guy I get it.  But for those prices, the service should have been flawless.  Instead, they ended up with some sediment in both decanters from the wine, and the glasses were honestly low rent, the Riedel glasses you can buy at Target are better than the stems we were given. ***MINUS ONE STAR***  The food was great, expensive, but everything was prepared perfectly, and we have no complaints there.  But lots of places have expensive, well prepared food in Vegas.   What made SW special for us in the past was the total experience.  After this event, we'll probably never be back, and we're sad for that, as we had so many great dinners with them in the past.  One last note, SW proudly displays signage about enforcing a dress code, and in years past it was nice.  But the number dinners in jeans and t-shirts really hurts the image of the place.  At least require a collared shirt for men if you're going to worry about a dress code at all.",

We sat down promptly and had two servers - both extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu.  We started with the tuna tartar, shared the 24oz bone-in ribeye (which they sliced for us since we were sharing), and the seasonal lobster mac and cheese as a side, along with parmesan spinach.  Absolutely fantastic and cooked to perfection.  Don't be turned off if you can't get a reservation here.  You may have some luck (1) eating at the bar, or (2) asking the host if they can squeeze you in whenever possible ;)",

We had a private room in the back by the patio and it was the most beautiful and elegant private room I have ever seen! We had the option of several set menus to choose from which I have to say were absolutely phenomenal! They brought out several seafood platters which had crab legs, shrimp, several kind of oysters, and it was absolutely amazing!!! Then we have the choice of several salads and soups. For the third course it was roasted chicken, salmon, and a few different kinds of steaks all which came with a side dish. Then of course came dessert which was a chocolate mousse cake! I have the bone in ribeye and it was to dye for!! It was cooked to perfection! Our side dishes were mushrooms, broccolini, and mashed potatoes! I had to have more mashed potatoes so I got an order to go!!! They were some of the best ever! The price for each person was 165 and absolutely well worth every single penny! Everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was absolutely phenomenal!  A huge thank you to SW for accommodating us and we will definitely be back. Hey what can I say, I am a sucker for red meat, good food,and great drinks; and SW steakhouse satisfied all three!",

    "text": "This place could have been a four if it wasn't for our unattentive waiter. EVERYTHING JUST TOOK FOREVER. He didn't really came and check up on us much and even when we were done and took a LONG time to bring us our check. It was a bit ridiculous as I decide to give this place a 3 stars.  Honestly, the only thing that really stand out was the Chile rubbed double ribeye that made this restaurant standout. There were a plate full of bread that I really didn't enjoy much. It's not even because I find Craft's steakhouse's dinner roll 100x better but i just didn't like the breads they provided. I thought it was cool that they provided high quality butter with pepper on top and olive oil on the bottom. However, I just simply didn't enjoy the bread.  The things that we did get besides Chili rubbed double rib eye were the truffled cream corn, potato puree, bone in ribeye, and gnocchi  and cream spinach. I thought the sides were really mediocre. The one I liked the least was the cream spinach as the cheese totally overwhelmed the dish that I simply can't forced myself to eat more. The potato puree wasn't anything special and I've definitely had better potato puree. The truffled cream corn was a bit interesting. This is one of those times where don't let the looks deceived you. (TO BE HONEST) I thought it looked like puke but when I had a bite of it, it was actually pretty good cream corn. It's not your regular cream corn that is super creamy. this cream corn is a light dish where the sauce is a bit runny. My complain would be that I didn't taste the truffle at all.   The bone-in rib eye and the Chili rubbed double rib eye: The bone in rib eye was fairly decent as I know they charred the top on purpose to have that burnt look. I didn't mind it as I quite enjoy the charred top. The bone-in rib eye was only decent but as I was smart enough and have the the chili rubbed double rib eye right in front of me, I indulged the regular rib eye with that amazing chile rubbed.   The party of the meal was the Chile rubbed double rib eye which came in a HUGE PLATE. IT was simply amazing and the most unique steak I've had. That Chile rubbed oil sauce was just that cheese to your grill cheese sandwich. I almost indulge everything aftewards(the sides, the other steak ) with the chile rubbed oil. It was that good and it definitely went well with that steak it comes with as it had a great charred to it. A bunch of peppers, onions(mmm), and the rest of the 40ish something oz steak. It is a must get if you haven't tried this place.   I say you should go give it a run with another person just to solely try the chile rubbed double rib eye and that's it. That was a standoff and nothing else on that dining table even compared to this dish. The service could use a bit of an adjustment but I REALLY LOVE the atmosphere of the outside as you could watch the waterfall while eating your dinner.",

    "text": "You can't find a better steak house than this. Personally I've dined at SW maybe 15 or 20 times and I have never ever had a less than perfect dining experience every single time so for *some* of the reviews that are not 5 stars I find to be biased and not trustworthy based on averages. Seeing comments like complaining about about snobbery, loudness, wine corking fees etc., yes this is Vegas after all, room service for a hamburger and fries will run you at the least $65. To bring some perspective to the table they see a lot of millionaires and even some billionaires dine in their restaurant every week. Many are regulars of the hotel and pretty big fish, some are celebrities. That's not to say that if you're not one of these you won't have the most amazing meal and service of your life, you probably will. But don't be upset if you didn't get the best table in the restaurant because you made a reservation in advance. If this is something of your deepest desires you need a great casino host they have the keys to the city.   I have been coming to Vegas for about 20 years and have eaten at Prime, Picasso's, Alex and too many others to count that were all once part of the original Wynn empire, and a few others including Craft which I didn't care for. Out of all of the restaurants to choose from in Vegas this is my favorite. The service is impeccable. You can't just apply to work here these people are scouted and are the best of the best. They know what you want faster than you do, they are more polite than you will ever meet, they live eat and breathe this. When you have a table of 8 and dinner is brought to the table it is like a choreographed dance.   Now the steak... the steak. The steak. This is what dreams are made of. I usually go for the bigger cuts and bone in and never a filet. All though I can never finish it these are the best cuts and where the flavor is. I also always go medium rare so that the steak is at its juiciest. The last steak I had was not on the menu but was a sous vide steak. I'm embarrassed to say had we not been late for a show I may have eaten the entire thing and I don't think anyone at the table would have judged me for doing so. It was the most tender flavorful best steak I've ever had in my life. All their sides are great too we typically will get an au gratin and maybe a veg. Don't fill up on their delicious crack bread, it's a trick you have more amazing food coming. Do get the Caesar salad If I was a Kardashian I would hire the chef who prepares this to make every day. It's really good! All their seafood is also amazing, the Wynn always has the best oysters and caviar. And for sure you must get the Churros you won't have room but that won't matter when they arrive. Try to score a spot close to the patio when they open the doors on a warm Vegas night, and sit back relax fine dining is not meant to be rushed. You may even spot Steve Wynn and his entourage float through the restaurant to the private dining room in the back.",

Do: Get potatoes au gratin they are delicious perfectly crisped cheese and cooked potatoes... but there is one catch... it is far too small of a serving.  Do: Eat the bread because... they have three choices all of them are delicious... the bacon bread, the pretzel bread and the random red head step child bread that was thrown in for fun. Bacon bread yum and pretzel bread yum.  Do: Get a big steak and cook it lower than medium (if you are at a steak ordering above medium... why are you here? go to sizzler and save money, quit ruining meat)  Do Not: Get the mac and cheese. just very underwhelming, and not creamy enough. Dont get it and thank me later.  Do: get dessert because why go otherwise.   THE VERDICT: i think i like del friscos more... wait i know i like del friscos more. Every place has something delicious... this is a good place but if you are going to drop 200 dollars just once in your visit to vegas id suggest somewhere else. but if you like trying new places gotta go yo.",

The service was really good. There was nothing on the dessert menu that really jumped out at me. One only negative feedback that I have was the fact that we wanted to sit by window to watch the water show and were told someone had reserved that seat In November.",

The ambiance was quite nice. But what annoyed me so much was that they were keep turning all the walk ins away  while  during they 2 hour and 45 minutes that we were dining there was there at least 7 tables empty . So they just pretend that it's difficult to book it even though really is something else . To be fair and waiter was such an amazing friendly guy even though he made a mistake in our order but we were really happy with him.  So if you are in Vegas and would like to have some options this one is okay but don't get your hopes so up !!!",

    "text": "I have to say that I'm actually shocked by the fact I have to write a 3 star review for a Wynn restaurant.  I've dined at several Wynn & Encore restaurants and grown accustomed to having fantastic service and food, but this one missed the mark.  I am giving 3 stars since the food was good, but I should be giving less stars for the service.  One thing I will say, maybe the servers were aggravated by a vegan dining at a steakhouse, but my money spends, right?  Every restaurant at Wynn has a vegan menu and I like trying different things.  When I asked to see the vegan menu the male server seemed annoyed.  Not the usual \"any other food allergies we should be aware of?\" .  It just made me feel uncomfortable, like he didn't think I should be/wasn't good enough to be dining there.  While I was waiting to order I saw servers chatting and laughing for a few minutes.  I'm sure I'm just being paranoid, but after already feeling uncomfortable I was wondering if they were talking about me?  Now onto the food...  A female server came to take my order.  She was pleasant.  I placed my order and she said she would bring out vegan bread and butter.  So they brought out my bread and butter, but I'm glad I asked if it was vegan because it was dairy butter and two different kinds of non vegan bread.  One bread was a cheese and bacon biscuit.  I'm vegan due to food allergies of cows milk and eggs, so this is a big deal.  Usually at Wynn I don't have to hound them with \"Is this really vegan?\", but I'm glad I did this time.  They brought out my correct bread and butter, but no one even apologized for the mistake.  My kale and apple salad came out next.  It was good, I was pleased with it.  Very shortly after came my mushroom dish with white bean puree.  It was presently well and tasted great.  Even though my food was good (minus the almost eating dairy/egg filled foods), the mediocre service left a bad taste in my mouth.  I passed on dessert and left.  On my way out no one thanked me for visiting or told me to have a good night.  Rude.  The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance and waterfall is spectacular, but after the poor service, I won't be back.",

Staff was not attentive...periods of 20-30 min with no staff visiting your table.

    "text": "Went here for a birthday dinner, and we weren't disappointed!  This is a high end steakhouse, but the prices seemed similar to other high end dining in Vegas.   Service Booked a reservation and were seated right away. The service was great and what we expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Attentive professional waiter who mainly explained the menu and took orders and supervised the experience while the food was served by other staff members. Very unintrusive but water glasses were always kept full. Very pleasant and leisurely pace for the meal; there were comfortable pauses between courses where dishes were cleared and the table tidied.   Ambiance A very upscale and classy feel inside. Not dark and heavy and leathery like many steakhouses which was a nice surprise.  There is a fountain outside with a sort of a show with lights and effects and music (and a signing frog I think?) every 30 minutes or so which seemed odd at first but was actually pretty cute.   Food Everything was really exceptional. Wonderful cocktails, shrimp cocktail appetizer, and of course amazing steak. Even the bread basket was amazing - pretzel bread!  Need we say more?  Sides are ordered a la carte. We loved the mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The sides are huge; you will likely have plenty to take home. Exquisite dessert; they decorated one of the desserts with a birthday greeting for us which was a nice touch.   Mojo An upscale classy steakhouse with a refreshingly modern interior. Great service as expected in a high end restaurant and excellent food. Prices are high but not more than similar restaurants. Overall highly recommended!",

We chose to sit outside so that we could watch the little light shows that is put on. There are heaters throughout the patio seating so if you go on a chilly night you can still enjoy dinner out there. I started with a red sangria which was very delightful.   I ordered a caprese salad. It beautifully plated and set a perfect tone for what was to come. Two complimentary baskets of warm assorted breads were brought out to our table. The French baguette was amazing and the rest of our table went Bananas over the bacon and cheese muffin. My husband ordered the Alaskan halibut fish and chips. It was a beautiful and delicious spin on fish and chips. I ordered the scallop dinner. YALL.... it was FANTASTIC. The scallops were a beautiful size and they melted in my mouth like butter. My mouth is watering writing this.  The scallops were served over a bed of English pea risotto that was seriously from the heavens. Every bite was savored and nothing was left on my plate when I was done.   The wait staff was excellent, attentive, and kind. We all loved our dishes as well as our wonderful dining experience. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a spectacularly special night.",

Immediately our waiter (Fernando) rushing us to order stating the kitchen closes in 30 minutes when he was taking our order.     Keep in mind with the amount of money you plan to spend at the SW and to get that treatment not a good start.    It was very uncomfortable and to top it off our drinks never came out on time and when we re-ordered drinks some people in our party did not receive them.   The steaks itself were not up to par.   When coming from NYC the SW would not cut the mustard.   The Wagyu beef was a joke compared to many other places we have had Wagyu.   They never even provided a certificate to prove the authenticity.     One person in our party is a well known chef and he personally complained about the quality of the Wagyu and our entire meal.     Our sides were good but not great and the only good steak I have to say was the 30 ounce Tomahawk.     Just a very poor experience and a complete disappointment.",

    "text": "Given that SW Steakhouse is located next to the famed Lake of Dreams at the Wynn, it's only appropriate that the experience was...well, dreamy!  Only a few small hiccups in timing prevented this from being an utter fantasy. To be sure, these did not affect my overall impression of SW, but perhaps next time they'll be ironed out.  After checking in for our 8p reservation, we waited 20 minutes to be seated. I was hoping that this didn't result in the nightmare that is HANGRY, but we were led to our table just before that monster raised his ugly head. We'd brought our own bottle of wine and it was swiftly decanted and given some breathing room.  Our table was probably one of the best ones in the restaurant- right next to the Lake of Dreams. We were able to see 4-5 shows throughout our meal. I consider myself to be appreciative of artistic endeavors, but the Lake was just a little too odd for me. I felt like I'd need some extra \"dream enhancement\" to truly appreciate it. Nevertheless, it was a beautiful view.  Now, to the food! Pretty spectacular all around. We ordered the scallops entree to split as an appetizer, and it did not disappoint. The scallops were meaty, had a good char and seasoning on the outside, and were tender on the inside. The sauce was delicious, like a red wine gravy. The risotto was a bit firmer than I prefer, but did not detract from the dish.  My steak, a boneless ribeye, was very solid. I wish I'd ordered medium rare instead of medium, but it was still very nice. The char and seasoning were excellent, the meat pretty tender. I ordered the lobster add on, and was very glad that I did. Beautiful hunks of lobster meat in the shell, not over cooked, and added to my steak. The side of creamed spinach we shared was fantastic as well. Just enough cream to make it feel decadent.   My dessert, the bananas foster bread pudding was good. I wish it was a bigger portion (hey, a girl can dream), but it was tasty, not too runny, and the nuts added great texture. The ice cream on top was lovely as well.  The only bobble in our dream state was that the speed/service issues did not improve throughout the meal. I'm all for a leisurely dining experience, but some of the pacing dragged a bit too much. Perhaps it was because of the lake shows, perhaps it was just an extremely busy night.  Regardless, my meal at SW Steakhouse was a dream that I'd love to revisit.",

    "text": "You get what you pay for. In this instance, a phenomenal steak. This was my third visit to SW. All three times I made a reservation months in advance. And all three times I arrived a few minutes early for my reservation. I'm never in a hurry when I go to SW, so waiting isn't that big of a deal. But all three times I've had to wait 20 minutes past my scheduled reservation to be seated. So when you go and have a reservation, just know there's a good chance you will be seated after your scheduled time. Now for the food. The steaks are thick, with a mouth watering char on the outside and cooked perfectly every time. I've tried all of the sides(we ordered all of them in a big group once). And all of them are pretty good. When I go back for my 4th time, I'm not sure I'll order a side. The bread you get before your meal might be the best side they offer, and it's free! Then maybe I'll leave room to try one of their desserts that look amazing when staring at other people eating them from afar. They do give you free chocolates after the meal. I thought they were ok. My wife talked about how bad they were for three days. So i guess my biggest suggestion is to change out those chocolates. You never want customers leaving on a bad note.",

As the meat eaters at the table indulged in every single appetizer, I ordered the creamed corn with truffle and made with cashew cream which tasted like its dairy filled counterpart.  It's def a very decadent side and made for a great start. For my meal, most vegetarian options on the menu were made with gardein meat which contains gluten So my options were limited. I ordered the celery root soup which was not a pleasant texture and reminded me of grits or oatmeal. I would stay away from this soup.   The rest of the table enjoyed the well executed steaks and the best was the chateau briand which was cooked to a tender perfection.   We enjoyed the outdoor patio seating with the view of the water and a show that plays every 45 mins with interesting music and art.",

The second one is despite the grandeur of the restaurant I found their cocktails to be rather boring. Every other aspect was phenomenal. The crab cake, although small, was delicious. The remoulade sauce totally makes the dish. The Wagyu literally melted in my mouth & was akin to the best wagyu I've had in other establishments but a premium price being that it's located inside a five star hotel. The scallops were humongous in stature & accompanied with the black truffle risotto were hands down the best scallops I've ever tasted. The lobster gnocchi with black truffles was sheer decadence with the creamiest of textures. Lastly the cookie butter cheesecake was an absolute decadent & rich finale to an awesome meal. I do suggest you request a table closet to the water on the terrace as you'll get a front row seat of the animated spectacle show which takes place every half hour.",

Filet melted in our mouths, the Cheese crusted lamb chops very nice but not the best I've ever had. All the sides we tried were very good but only the creamed corn unique and a standout.  The creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and Potatoe Lyonnaise very good but again nothing outstanding.  Dessert was the funnel cakes and strawberries, molten cake and the deep fried peach pie.

We usually have at least 15 people dining with us (about 5 c-workers and the rest business associates/customers)  It is located in The Wynn on the Las Vegas Strip. It is a great place to take people for business meals.  (Food) The bread they serve is fresh and warm. We always get the Seafood Spectacular to start and it is divine! It has lobster, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cocktail. Very filling and entirely worth it. When I order, I typically order the salmon dish with the kale and honey crisp apple salad (certainly more than enough for me to eat). I am never hungry when I leave this restaurant.  (Drink) They have a great wine selection and the servers do a great job at giving their suggestions. Upon walking into the restaurant there is also a bar to the left where you can grab a drink while waiting to be seated.  (Vibe) There is a beautiful waterfall with outdoor seating. Everyone looks forward to the little show that goes on at about 9/9:30pm and 10pm with the singing frog at the waterfall as well. It is always a nice talking point with new customers that come along with us.  This is a very fine steakhouse that my company has made great memories at!",

    "text": "This is an expensive meat palace which actually serves it instead of going to leer at it. The dress is \"Business Casual\" but then that depends on what your business is. What do you wear if it's just Monkey Business? The place is full of thigh high leather that is fetish free for a change.   The room is quiet for a Vegas venue until the music loop bomb goes off numbing your Vagus nerve. I was shunted into the jammed bar where I ordered a Whiskey Sour that came in a thimble. The Cocktail slinger must have heard me say Whiskey and Soap as I think the bar tender floated some Dial on it. Steve, you can do better.   The decor is Wynnsome. Muted, sand colored earth tones so you'll feel right at home when you get buried by the bill.   It was a \"Lake Side\" table for us \"B\" Listers, but then you can still avoid the Strip and the strippers. Instead you can stare at a 4 story water wall with cartoons, holograms and creepy virtual visuals while consuming your vittles. They just pop up at random cranked to concert volume just when you are about to propose or at least make a proposition.   All of a sudden a peyote fueled steampunk fantasy flashes before you, Native visionaries start warbling at vox alto channeling Tibetan Throat Singers. Wow...no more Whiskey and Purell for me.   The Vibe: Black Chips, fat chippies, drifters, grifters, and booby lifters all steppin' out...or flamin' out.   The Staff: As no nonsense as a Vegas Lounge Act. Whatever cutesy thing you can think of, they've heard it twice that night. It was like heckling Joan Rivers. Prepare to be skewered quickly. Amy was as tough as cheap meat and no heckler gets a winning hand with her. She was a pro (as in Pro Server, don't be cheeky. She knew the menu and required no help with the Heroic wine list. Kudos and a nice toke to her).   The Bar Program: Standards that are substandard as well as a Herculean wine list as large as Steve Wynn's portfolio, featuring mostly wines that only he can afford. May I see the Fanta list please?   The Food: Oh yeah, you came to dine or did you just want to see the dancing balls on the water? (Sounds like the hot tub in the motel after the Pride Parade ends).   A Seafood Tower trumps the lot, thought I. Local caught Lobster, local harvested Oysters, local trapped Crabs (definitely a possibility in Vegas), local gathered Shrimp? All local to somewhere else and when they arrived they were travel tired. Hey, life's a gamble, I guess, especially in Vegas. So, order a Tower and roll the dice or play Russian Oyster Roulette instead of eating a nice Seafood Rillette.   Now, the Bacon Cheddar Muffins were worth the hassle to get to Sin City. Cheesy muffin top and a soft spongy bottom describes them and half the ladies wandering around the Venetian. I ate four of them. (Biscuits, don't be cheeky).   Hold it, out of nowhere Garth Brooks lyrics begin to scroll across the Jumbo Tron, his Jumbo Voice blasts The Thunder Rolls over the music and all conversation is terminated like a dropped call. Hmmm, does that add anything to anything?    Steve's Chopped Salad is a pretty cylinder of chopped Romaine, Avocado, Fried Shallot Strings under a Dijon Vinaigrette. It was fresh and great with a another basket of Bacon Cheddars.   The French Fries were spot on. Nice crunch to the whole bunch. The Brussells Sprouts with Bacon were predictable as were the whupped Potatoes with Chives and the Jalapeno Creamed Corn masquerading as Polenta. Both were a bit on the gluey side. Who want's a gluey side? That's over the wall on the Strip. The Bacon was Maple-ized Belly Bacon with caramelized Shallots were stellar. The sides were no bummers, just ho hummers.   The Dry-Aged Porterhouse as fired just right. Medium, as it should be. Vegas pink on the inside. (Don't be cheeky), with some Maldon Sea Salt to finish it properly and spark the meaty taste. Alas, there was some mystery chew that tagged along for the ride. That's par for the course with steak. You Wynn some, you lose some. The Bone-In Rib Eye played much better.   Four bottles of Beaujolais and we were anxious to be away to play.   So, no dessert except a Birthday spiff. A cake the size of a walnut with a mini candle. How cute.   It may be worth a visit just to see the scene. Watch some lollypop in a pencil skirt so tight that eating a pine nut would have the thing rip at the seams. Palm the Maitre D to get a good seat for that.   Is this spot a Wynn win? Place your bets, and spin the wheel.",

    "text": "Steak was very nice; ambiance and service a big zero. Have eaten at now defunct Botero, Costa di Mare twice for amazing tasting with hubby with graceful and charming/playful atmosphere, and pretty much every other fine dining and/or eatery during multiple stays at the Wynn and Encore (see my longstanding positive reviews about Wynn separately). During a recent, very special occasion my very dear friend selected SW for her big birthday dinner (and no kidding flew halfway around the world with friends for it). The vaunted lakeside dining was too windy so we ate inside. I have to say, the indoor space was fairly charmless and the service perfunctory. Not NY cool and old-world brusque, but simply busy and \"don't really care\". With so many people coming and going I had no idea who our actual server was. Despite being asked multiple times if it were a 'special occasion' upon reservation and check-in (this is key to the let-down that ensued), there was absolutely nothing special about it besides the effort we made in showing up. No special greeting at the door, no \"happy birthday\" verbal acknowledgment, no special cake for the bday girl besides a pathetic quarter sized after-thought that I had to request (and was crazy embarrassed when I saw it being practically thrown on the table-I'm now guessing the server was embarrassed too!). Just us spending 500 dollars on a decent steak with zero vibe or buzz. I won't go into the awful treatment when I spoke with the sub-manager about our sub par and disappointing experience and was met with a wall of pure defensive hostility that I just had to back slowly away from. Vegas and the Wynn/Encore are special to me with over a decade of repeated stays. If Vegas isn't for celebrations and escape, what is it actually for? Thankfully the very gracious Wynn concierge (not associated with the restaurant per se) made an attempt to 'make it right' with a bottle of prosecco the next day sent to the room for the bday girl. Thank you. Recently in my home of DC I celebrated a friend's birthday in the magical outdoor 'igloo' at Bourbon Steak/ 4 Seasons, and was reassured that a steakhouse celebration can be light and fun, with great down to earth and kind service. Our \"birthday boy\" was also gifted a rather small cake on the restaurant (must be a steakhouse thing), but it was delivered with a smile one top of an already comepletely pleasurable evening. What a difference. SW--you so took us for granted. If you are on an expense account by all means go to SW. If you want a  convivial dining \"experience\", I would say there are a 1,000,000 places in Vegas from $ to $$$ to try first. Bon appetit!",

So most recently I was here for a date night dinner. As always the device was truly 5 star 5 diamond. Fast, efficient, knowledgeable and always friendly. That consistancy is huge for me and SW is nothing if not consistently excellent.   With indoor and outdoor seating available I chose to sit outside by the lake. The view of the lake and nightly show during dinner is so beautiful and adds so much richness to the ambiance and experience.   The menu is short but focused on specialty. The fresh gnocchi is to die for. The aged rib eye was melt in your mouth delicious. On the vegan side of the menu, delicois options. I chose the meatballs and mashed potatoes. So amazingly flavorful and savory I needed a moment to savor it.  Overall this was another fabulous experience at one of the best luxury fine dining spots in town.",

The steak was well done that's True but I don't think the cuts are quality the amount of fat was excessive it's supposed to be \"marbly\" but in your cuts it was to concentrated in single place.  And the service felt a bit unrespectful, perhaps it was due to us being a large group and we are a Happy bunch.  The rest was great the fogra was perfect they have a cold version and a hot version both were perfect. The yellowtail tartar and the waygu tartar were nice as well.  I really like the food but the price on the steak is a deal breaker in my eyes and if you see my other reviews you would know I don't mind spending good money on good food...",

I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend and I look forward to coming here.. unfortunately we called to late for a reservation and cannot get in. Good thing Las Vegas is an hour flight away ;)  After writing this review, I decided to call them to see if they have any openings and score!!! I got an rsvp!!

Service was of course on point as every good restaurant in the Wynn is. Tuna tartare as well as the chopped salad was very good and fresh. My bone-in ribeye was served on a cold plate, perhaps they mistook a salad plate for a steak plate. Perhaps a blessing in disguise because I ordered it medium rare, if it were served on a hot plate to continue to cook I would have ended up with a medium well steak because it arrived medium to say the least  (over cooked from the beginning) au gratin potatoes were very good, jumbo asparagus was good but standard. Cheese crusted lamb chops were very good, goat cheese Dijon, finally funnel cakes for dessert such a nice change from cliche beignets it adds a upscale county fair aspect to dinning. Fresh strawberries with Creme, salty caramel and fudge dipping sauces a visual delight but slightly better looking than tasting it was very good don't get me wrong. Personally I felt for the price a lot of steakhouses does it for much better at half the prices......I guess it is Vegas",

Once we ordered, the food came quickly - and was hot and delicious.  Most of our table ordered the steak (8oz filet), and everyone was happy.   The sides we got were big portions (enough for 4-5 people to share).    We got potato at gratin, Mac n cheese and creamed corn.     The bread basket was awesome - they have these cheddar/bacon rolls (muffins?) that were to-die-for.     We didn't do any appetizers or dessert - and honestly, we would have ordered both had the service not been so terrible (see below).     The wine list was extensive, but I'd say the cheapest glass was 16-18 and the cheapest bottle was around 90 (up to bottles for 10k+).  The wine was good, but the prices were very high.    The service - just ouch.   Group of 5 (business dinner) - We arrived at 715 for a 730 reservation and checked in.   The host stand  was very disorganIzed, and we went up at 745 to check on our spot in line.   The hostesses were arguing with a manager, and when I told them our party's name, the manager said 'oh' , and pulled a seating slip from a pile below (not the seating slips that either of hostesses were holding to 'seat next') and brought us to a table.  I'll try to summarize the rest of the dinner experience succinctly:  - 45 minutes - time for the water to come get our drink orders once seated (we ordered one bottle of wine) - 30 minutes later - waiter came to take our order.   We skipped by appetizers at this point since it had been so long  -20 minutes later - our food came (this was the only part of dinner service that was ok/timely) -waiter never came by to check on orders -40 minutes later - waiter dropped off dessert menu.   Didn't ask if we wanted more wine (we would have) -30 minutes later - we flagged a bus boy to get our check.   We paid and left.  Maybe it was an off/short-handed night - the food was good and I'd go back but I'd be hesitant to have another business dinner here",

Then the table had lobster, domestic wagyu  steak , a bone in rib eye, which our friend said exceeded the Golden Steer rib eye he had the night before.  The hubby had the 12 oz. filet which was cooked perfectly.  Now let me tell you about some of the sides...get the Truffle creamed corn!  Do not pass go, do not collect $200 and DO NOT SHARE!  This was AMAING!!!! Also had a Caesar salad that hubby ordered that was nicely dressed and not too fishy from the anchovies and the romaine lettuce was perfectly crispy!! The weak point was their after dinner coffee.  The one cup looked so weak we thought it was hot tea.  But hey, if that was all they did wrong I am IN.  Always a wonderful evening and we all enjoyed!  And don't skip the dessert. They are amazing too!!",

I actually love the Wynn hotel and have stayed here many times.  I mostly stay at MGM properties b/c I like the loyalty program and they are pretty fair about comps they give. If you make reservations be sure to ask for something as close to the glass and pond as possible as they do cool shows on the pond later in the evening.  You'll enjoy it.",

Not only did we wasn't able to sit at a window sit, they placed us on the opposite side of the restaurant, where we could barley see the screen. The last negative point was the Maitre D was going around to the tables greeting the guests and making small talk and yes he skipped our table. The positives....The servers was awesome, the commutations and recommendations was very welcome. The food was good, the crab cake was really good. The scallops was also great. The drinks was very good. Sorry no pics",

Highly recommend reservation ahead of time and be sure to request a table by the lake. Service was very attentive and the menu is quite extensive. SW did a great job in every category of the menu. Menu may be on pricier end but it's all quality. Expect to allocate about 2 hours for dinner.   Appetizers: Complimentary house bread - must try the bacon bread with house butter, but friendly reminder not to eat so much!  Hudson Valley Foie gras appetizer with apple compote - one of the best foie gras! It was tender and the sweetness of the apple compote balance the flavor of foie gras. It was lightly seared and very flavorful. We chose the appetizer instead of the compliment with the steak because the appetizer comes with the compote.   Tuna tartare with sesame wafer - On par with fresh fish serve in a highly rated Japanese restaurant. Actually, this may be more fresh and better then most Japanese restaurant! I skipped the sesame wafer for the tuna tartare alone was fresh and delicious.  Domestic wagyu from Snake river farms NY strip 10oz $80 - Charred and the steak was done medium rare to perfection. The flavor and balance of the fat in the steak was mouth-watering. For a NY strip, it was quite fatty like a ribeye and I enjoyed every bite of it. Complimented with enoki mushroom.   Wagyu A5 from Kagoshima prefecture 4oz $140 compliment with chopped greens (chinese brocoli?) - We ordered both domestic and Japanese Wagyu to compare it side by side. The 4 oz portion was a generous amount of meat and I almost couldn't finish. It was lightly seared to medium rare. As compared to domestic, A5 wagyu has more meaty taste, less seasoning, and less flaming char flavor. It was also not as salty as the domestic one. Both wagyu was very enjoyable and was different in taste.   sauteed spinach - crispy and tasty  carrots - sweet and fresh  funnel cake with strawberry and 3 dipping sauce (anglaise, salty caramel, and chocolate) - it was good, but a bite too much carb to my liking. I only ate one funnel cake and it was very filling. You have the option to order half order with 3 funnel cakes ($10), instead of 6 ($20).",

    "text": "Date night on our last night in vegas!  We decided to try SW Steakhouse at the Wynn. As we went down the escalator at entrance of the restaurant, waterfall show was going on. It was so beautiful! (There is a lounge where you can watch the waterfall but you must put your name down to be seated there. It also has a one drink minimum.)  We went to the restaurant without any reservation around 7pm and hoping to get lucky. While waiting, I got a pom martini and him a jack and coke. We were seated in less than 10min! YAY.  ++pom martini (3.5 stars) I had two of these. First one was perfect. Perfect amount of sweet and alcohol. 2nd time, it was really syrupy and had to ask for ice to dilute the drink. The drink was inconsistent.  ++pepper crusted chateaubriand (3.5 stars) $120 We ordered this and shared as the server suggested it serves two people. Meat was filet mignon so we got it medium. Perfectly cooked. The dish was great but it wasn't the best steak I've ever had. Also felt like the spiciness of the pepper overpowered the flavor of the steak.  The ambience was beautiful. the crowd was mostly on the older side (ie 60s 70s). also were business men and such.   After the meal, we went to sit at the lounge and had few more drinks. We watched the waterfall show 3 times (show is every 20 min) before we left. Btw, the show is different every time.   Overall, I give this restaurant 4 stars. The food was 3.5 stars but with its excellent service, show, and ambience 4 solid stars.",

    "text": "I think I'll stick to the Lakeside next time. During a recent trip to Las Vegas, my husband and I knew exactly where we wanted to go to have a nice dinner...one of the two restaurants overlooking the lake at our hotel, the Wynn. Since we had tried the Lakeside during a previous visit, we decided to give their next door neightbor, SW Steakhouse a try. I need to remember to stick with my first choice in the future.   Half the fun of eating at either SW or Lakeside is sitting on the patio overlooking the lake, but since it was \"cold,\" they had the patio closed. Therefore, our reservation requesting a view of the show on the patio was None and void. Since the patio was closed, there was minimal seating along the window and although we had a reservation with a lake view request, a window seat wasn't available so rather than wait another hour, we decided to go with whatever was available. That turned out to be the table furthest away from the window, in the back of the restaurant. However, I wasn't going to let that get me down! After all, we were still at an incredibly delicious restaurant! My favorite part of the meal ended up being the cheese rolls they bring out to begin the meal. I gobbled up every bite and immediately regretted my decision as I felt myself filling up! But, I found room to continue. Our first course was the wedge salad which I really enjoyed. For my entree, I decided to order the lamb chops. This is where disappointment comes into play. Here at this incredibly expensive, high-end restaurant, my lamb chops arrived to the table cold...or should I say, cold to lukewarm. I tried one bite and thought it was just a bad bite but then I had a second and confirmed my suspicions. Now, knowing this restaurant and how they pride themselves in their service and products, I expected complete horror in the eyes of the waiter when he realized the issue. However, when he came over and I told him that my food was cold, he didn't seem very phased and didn't apologize. Instead he just took the food back and I waited ten minutes to get hot lamb chops while my husband's food had been there the whole time. After this less-than-par experience of my incredibly expensive entree coming out cold, the waiter never once apologized and when the bill came, there was no mention of this situation. I wasn't expecting the lamb chops to be comped (although in most situations, the restaurant would do that after such a thing happened), but nothing so much as a drink or side was discounted to apologize for the mistake. This showed their lack of customer service and their lack of truly caring about the customer. It was the complete opposite experience that I had at the Lakeside. Moving forward, I will only eat at the Lakeside next door.",

Now I would have to say at first that the ambiance of the steakhouse is not my favorite. I like the darker more intimate steakhouses. The SW had more of a sterile wide open feel to it. The SW does have a nice wall of windows overlooking the Wynn Waterfall.   The service is second to none. I would have to say that you will never have to get your waiters attention. They are always there to take care of any of your requests. I ended up splitting a steak with my Dad and they had no problem and didn't charge extra. Steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Sides are a little less exciting than other Steakhouses I have been to, but were nice.   The price is a little higher than I would like to pay for the food and atmosphere, but the service lived up to the $. I think the Society restaurant offers just as good of food at a better price and more intimate setting.",

    "text": "Friday (9/12/14), right before the dinner rush:  Having heard a lot of good things about SW, I was very excited to try it.  When we arrived at 6:00 pm, we were promptly seated and the place filled up quickly soon afterwards. The inside is modern with one wall opening up onto a patio for outside dining.   Drinks: We started with a Boulevardier ($16) and a Negroni ($12). Both cocktails were well-made, strong and served straight up. A little pricy but I appreciated not having the drinks slowly diluted with a large amount of melting ice.  Appetizers and bread: The bread basket consisted of two French rolls, two pretzel rolls and two bacon rolls. I have heard people rave about the bacon rolls and they were savory but also very oily and heavy; not exactly what I wanted to fill up on right before a heavy steak dinner.  We ordered 3 Kusshi and 3 Rappahannock oysters which came in the standard ice tray with sides of mignonette and cocktail sauce ($21).  The oysters tasted fresh when we ate them. The burrata and tomato appetizer consisted of two thick large round slices of tomato with a much too small dollop of burrata cheese on top of each slice ($21). The cheese was good but the proportion of burrata to tomato was way off (perhaps they were running out of cheese and were trying to stretch what they had left?). We also got a crab cake ($24). The crab cake was a deep fried hockey puck shaped disk of crab meat. The meat deep inside tasted ok but the outside fried homogeneous crust was unappealing and overcooked.  Dinner: We ordered a medium rare bone-in NY strip steak ($68) and a medium bone-in ribeye ($60). Both steaks were cooked to the right degree but were bland tasting. Each plate comes with a small ramekin of Wagu flavored garlic butter which provided an interesting taste when spread over the meat. The SW house steak sauce was far too sweet for my taste so I ended up asking for some A1 just to get some additional flavor for the bland meat. The side dish of cream corn was unusual ($14). It was more like highly ground corn meal mixed with cream and had the texture of grits. There was a definite corn flavor although no recognizable pieces of corn remained. It would probably be a popular dish at a nursing home for people who can no longer chew their food. We also ordered grilled asparagus which was crunchy and perfectly charred ($16).  Dessert: We ordered the key lime square ($14). Served as a square, the crust was mixed with rice krispies which tended to clump together and stick to your teeth when you chewed, much like a rice krispies treat. I understand the pastry chef wanting to show what they could do but this was just unpleasant. Perhaps trying to make a good tasting pie would be a good place for them to start before attempting to be 'creative'.   The service was great and the waiters were very attentive however, at the end of the day, the food was forgettable. The place charges premium prices but only delivers mediocre tasting food. As other people have already noted, there are much better high end steak houses on the strip with fantastic food and service for the same prices that you are charged at SW. Why not go elsewhere?",

Everything there is superb. The service, the ambiance, the water show....by far one of my go to and favorite places. Never had a bad meal. Great selection of wines and side dishes. Cuts are cooked to perfection. Desserts....oh desserts, we've had almost every including specials and have never been disappointed. Good for a nice dinner date, a group gathering or special occasion. Outside seating on a beautiful Las Vegas night is the best!",

At the end of the meal when asked if we wanted coffee by waiter #2 and we had already order coffee from waiter #1 I barked back and stated we just ordered it 30 seconds early.  Seems like a small deal but when asked \"do you want more bread\" and then \"do you want more bread,\" followed by \"do you want more water,\" then \"do you want more water\" and so on...it made the meal rushed and choppy.   We have not been to SW in years.  It was  always a great experience.  I am not sure what we were expecting but after the endless video loops playing everywhere at the Wynn about the restaurants, including SW, we expected the same great experience as we had enjoyed historically.   The food was no different than any other high end steak house.  Much of the decor appeared dated.  The waterfall show was unchanged, tired and dingy.    We will not go back.",

    "text": "This place definitely has extreme hype due to lightshow at night and the glamorous location inside the Wynn.   Most of this establishment lives up to these expectations. The service is super professional and classy. These guys have hospitality down!   Most of the food was definitely good. I wouldn't say it was outstanding to the point that it was memorable. I've been to many more less expensive steakhouses outside of Vegas (but at the same time, it is Vegas).   Highlight of the meal was the Wedge Salad and the Wild Mushrooms. Both were delicious!   The steaks are tasty, but a little disappointing. First of all, like another Yelper mentioned, I can't believe they don't serve high quality grass fed organic beef here! For the price, I find the corn fed regular beef a big turn off.  Aside from the lightshow, I would say this place is worth 3.5 stars (especially for the high prices!!). However, sitting on the patio watching the show makes the whole experience awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed the numerous \"skits\".   I wouldn't say this place is a must stop, but the experience is fun and the food is pretty tasty overall.",

    "text": "I'm basing this review solely on food, for the service was excellent.  Five grown men needed meat on this bachelors getaway.  We started off with the sauteed foie gras and this foie gras pate with nectarines.  Since it is now banned in california, why not?  Both were absolutely amazing, although I enjoyed the sauteed one more because I've had foie gras in the pate form many times.  I cannot forget the slight char on the sauteed foie gras.  We also had the heirloom mozerrella salad, which was also tasty and balanced.  We paired the foie gras with a riesling, which was a mistake because both dishes were already sweet.  If i were to do it over, I would go the Sauvignon blanc route or pinot grigio route.  For the meat, we decided to get the lamb chops and the chile rubbed double cut ribeye, as featured on \"best thing I ever ate.\" First, let me say that I am really not a big fan of lamb, and I have only enjoyed lamb at a couple of places, but this lamb chop was just perfect.  See my pictures.  I cannot forget the balance of juicyness, temperture, sweetness and just enough game flavor to remind you its lamb, but not too much to remind me why I don't eat lamb a lot.  If I were to come back here, lamb chops will be ordered again.  Next, the chile rubbed ribeye.  Wow.  When it arrived, I was scared they over cooked it.  It was nice and charred inside, and it was till sizzling in that big skillet.  When I took my piece, I was shocked on how beautifully pink and medium it was, as we requested.  Charred fat outside, juicy pink meat inside = perfect ribeye to me.  It was served with onions and jalapenos also cooked on the skillet.  The rub was not really that spicy, and the seasoning was perfect.  All together, I really have to say it was a perfect ribeye, and I've only had perfectly cooked medium ribeyes and not too many places.  I would def order this again along with the lamb chops.  I've read descriptions that it is a glorified carne asada.  I can see how that descriptionis accurate.  Many of the steak purist might not enjoy the way this is cooked.  Some days, nothing can beat meat grilled to char then thrown into oven for proper color inside, then finish off with salt.  But on a day you want a flavorful, spicy kick, this is the perfect piece of meat.  All 42 oz of it was evenly cooked.  Again, see my pic. hahaha  We paired the meats with a bottle of shiraz/cab blend from paso robles.  Worked out great and didn't hurt the wallet.  I really didn't care about the truffle creamed corn.  The dish was so sweet, it overpowered any hint of shaved truffles.  I would never order this again.  Should've just gotten some potatoes.  Do not listen to anyone who says this is great.    I would not hesitate to come back here if craving a steak next time I end up in vegas.",

The wedge salad of all things. Big wedge of lettuce, with a blue cheese dressing that was full of crumbles that melt in your mouth. Alongside the wedge are heirloom grape tomatoes that scream Summer and a huge slab of pork belly that sent my heart all a-flutter. The combined tastes are orgasmic.  Beautiful view of the Lake of Dreams, impeccable service and killer steaks. A place worthy of the Wynn name.",

For anyone going for the first time, here are my recommendations:   Seating- try your best to get near the waterfall  Apps- the raw seafood tower was excellent. It included crab legs, oysters, shrimp, lobster, and tuna tartar.  Steaks- The bone in 20 oz Rib-eye is the way to go. Several in our party split it as we had a lot of food.  Sides- typical ones, and were good.  Deserts- we had the funnel cakes and choc souffle. Def a must.   We also ate at Craft, and I thought SW steaks were better. Craft was slow service as well.   The only issue we had, was at the front bar, we found the bartender ignored us as we wanted another round. In fact, everyone at the bar was laughing at him, bc he kept blowing us off. Minus 1 star!   With so many places to go in Vegas, add this to your list to try.   We still had a great dinner bc the steaks were so good.",

That is not the problem--it is the food. It is expensive so you have an expectation that the food will be top of the line.  It is not. It is just OK. The Caesar was bland; no real flavor. You would think for the prices you would get a Caesar that tastes like it was tossed tableside even if it is made in the kitchen. The real problem is the steak. Both times I got the bone-in rib-eye--their signature steak. The quality of the meat was USDA choice, at best. It definitely is not USDA prime. I can assure you that Costco's prime rib-eyes are ten times more flavorful and tender than these. The flavor of the steak, like the salad was flat--primarily because of the quality. The first time, I thought it was just a bad cut. But this time, it was exactly the same. If the restaurant is truly buying prime beef, they need to change suppliers. This steak tasted like something you would get at the hotel cafe, not a $65 steak at what is supposed to be one of the best steakhouses in town.  Very disappointing.",

    "text": "SW was a very good steakhouse, but nothing extraordinary. The environment is what you'd expect, crowded, loud, and dark. We had to wait a bit to get our table, even though we had a reservation, but no big deal. The service was attentive and professional. One warning, the corkage fee is high!!! I believe it was somewhere between $75-100! Now onto the food...  Appetizer: Caesar Salad and Asparagus Vinaigrette Mix. Both were large enough to be shared and tasted good. I did not care for the asparagus dish, but my date loved it, so I assume it was just me.    Entrees: Two steaks, one fillet and one new york strip. Both were cooked perfectly, and tasted great. Exactly what you would expect from a premier steakhouse.  Sides: Creamed Spinach and Crimini Mushrooms. The mushrooms were great ad the spinach was just average, ever since I had a quail egg on top of my creamed spinach (at CUT), I can't go without it.  Price: I think it was right around $300 for the two of us... Not Cheap  Overall, its a good steakhouse. Good service, wine list, steaks, and atmosphere. I would go back, but not as a first choice.",

    "text": "I had expected this to be better, as it was the main steakhouse at the Wynn where we were staying, but I left feeling a little underwhelmed. The filet I ordered was great. But I am VERY picky about steak at steakhouses. If I'm at a steakhouse, all of which are pretty much the same, I expect the steak to be perfect. It's the wine list, service and other dishes that make or break it. And in this case, the tomato and mozzarella salad was less than mediocre - they used tiny shriveled tomatoes without much flavor. The sauteed veggies on the side were a bit soggy. When I order a side of veggies, I'm trying to balance out the heart attack aspect of the meat, not clog my arteries with more oil.  The wine we had by the glass was lovely and the service was fabulous, as was the dancing froggie in the Lake of Dreams. I would recommend SW, but again, wasn't wowed by the experience. Next time, go to DB next door for a much better and more interesting meal.",

    "text": "hands down - the BEST steak i ever had! i am a True red-meat lover and have had some really good steaks. up until my experience at SW - peter luger's was at the top of my list...but i have to say, this was a great dining experience from start to finish. (i am glad that we didn't eat much that day to save our appetites for dinner!)   we were a 4-top and started with the foie gras ( we asked for it grilled instead) and kobe beef carpaccio. both very good - and a perfect start to dinner. 2 of us had the 20 oz bone-in rib eye and the other 2 had the special \"tomahawk rib eye\" (40 oz!) - everything was cooked to perfection! (see pictures). we also went with an array of sides - truffle creamed corn, parmesan creamed spinach, au gratin potatoes and onion rings. they were all excellent but if i had to recommend one over the others - it would be the creamed corn an au gratin potatoes...mmmm. dessert - check out my picture of the funnel cakes! great presentation and it was awesome.   i have to also say that service was excellent. nothing could ruin a meal more than bad service - but we had wonderful and attentive service from john (i hope i remembered his name after the food coma).   dinner was about $400 - this included all the above food, drinks and over 20% tip. worth every penny. can't rave enough and i can't wait for another visit....   fyi - business casual dress code (jeans are okay) and better make reservations well in advance.",

    "text": "SW steakhouse is by far one of the best steakhouses anywhere.  There are few restaurants that I would give 5 stars too, because there's almost always room to improve.  I think SW is at the top of its game.  The service was outstanding.  Our waitstaff was headed by a very friendly woman.  The rest of the team was intuitive and nice.  This helps set SW apart from many other steakhouses in Las Vegas.    The food was also outstanding.  Everything was top notch.  I was told that the bread was amazing and that was right.  It's baked fresh on premises and excellent.  I didn't want to fill up on bread, but I could have.  It set the tone for the rest of the meal.  My caesar salad was excellent and the rest of the table loved their seafood appetizers.  We went off the menu with a slice of bacon.  This was also awesome!  I ordered a strip (as always).  My strip was fantastic.  In fact, it was one of the best I've had in a while.  The steak was perfectly cooked.  There was a nice amount of char on the outside of the steak and the inside was soft and pink as I wanted.  I believe the steak was seasoned with just salt and pepper.  The salt stood out, but wasn't overbearing and the meat tasted fantastic.  I don't recall all of the sides ordered, but the photo above shows that we had parmesan creamed spinach.  I'm pretty sure that we also had the truffled creamed corn, butter roasted fingerling potatoes, and steamed asparagus.  All of the sides were excellent.  Overall, one of the best steaks and meals I've had in a really long time.  I'm looking forward to my next trip so I can sit outside and enjoy the show.",

    "text": "I was surprised...but not in a good way.  Knowing the level of scrutiny that overshadows everything remotely associated with perfectionist Steve Wynn, I expected more than was served last night.  The first ribeye had to go back...it was quite obviously not \"prime\" caliber...to say it was too fatty and gristly would be an understatement.  Our server told us that the butcher had recently changed the way he'd been cutting the steaks due to a shortage of Prime quality beef.  My response: please raise prices to maintain your margin but do not deviate from the standard SW fans have come to expect.  I would stay away until the issue is addressed - you can certainly find a better place for steak on the strip.  On the brighter side, the scallops were on par with what we'd had in the past.  As always, service was top notch.  Rating 3 stars because \"steak\" is in the name of the restaurant - SW I hope you can help get things back on track!",

The biggest objection that I had in addition to the food was the pricing on their wine.  The standard that you see is a 2x mark up this is why I was very surprised that it was 5x.  (example Joesph Phelps Cab $25 dollars retail and it was $140 on the wine list!)  I recommend if you come here to bring your own wine and pay the corkage of $35 per bottle.",

I've always wanted to order lamb at a high quality restaurant to see if there was a difference in the gaminess of the meat. Big difference! So I had the lamb and sauteed mushrooms. The meat was cook to perfection. However, i was a little surprised by the amount of the side of mushrooms. It was only enough for 1 person. Not like Craftsteak at MGM where you can order a few sides and share them with your guests. But overall the lamb was good. I had a bite of steak from my husbands plate... The steak, in my opinion was average... but i think it had a lot to do with the way my husband eats his steak. I like mine medium rare oppose to his... medium well.",

I also can't get my Mom to go into a nice restaurant unless they allow you to wear jeans (she thinks it's too frou frou) - thankfully we were weighed down w/ shopping bags and she was pretty tired - so dinner at the bar it was.   The crab cake (yes there is only one) was awesome.  The kobe carpaccio (a big 'ol plate of it) was amazing. The fried capers made it perfect.  The cesar (they split in half) was good as were the yummy cheese crackers on top.  Cocktails were good and strong.  Bartenders were funny and provided great service.   I was excited to eat somewhere in Vegas that actually tasted good - it was sorta like eating at home (in SF that is) and I like that. I will definitely be back - hopefully in the summer so we can watch the show that goes on outside every half hour.   4.5 Staaaaars",

    "text": "The 2 stars are given based on the quality of food that I got compared to the price range of this restaurant. With that said, this place left me quite disappointed. They are slightly more pricey than Mastro's, my all-time favorite steakhouse, yet did not deliver the quality that was even close to it.  My bf and I ordered the seafood spectacular, Russian osetra caviar, bone-in ribeye, and truffle creamed corn to share. The seafood spectacular had some hits and misses. The crab and oysters were good, but the lobster and shrimp lacked flavor. Caviar was good, but then again, a restaurant really shouldn't mess up caviar when it costs over $200 for a tiny jar.  Now onto the biggest disappointment of the night: the steak. My bf and I shared the 24-oz bone-in ribeye. The cut of the steak was actually not bad, but it was ruined by how HORRIBLY it was cooked. The outside was beyond charred; it was BURNT. We could literally hear the crunch as we were biting into the steak, not to mention the unpleasant, bitter taste of burnt meat. We asked for medium rare and the steak had 3 different temperatures going on all in one piece of meat: rare, medium rare, and medium. For a steakhouse at this price level, that is simply unacceptable. We wanted to send it back but we had another reservation afterwards so we decided to suck it up and eat it. The truffle creamed corn was more like grits and a bit too sweet for my liking, but my bf liked it.  Long story short, go spend your money at Mastro's or some other steakhouse in Vegas. In fact, instead of wasting $70+ on this sadly cooked piece of steak, I would rather have had a mediocre cut of steak at Fleming's that's at least COOKED right.",

It can easily be for two people.   The service was also very good and all the staff kept complimenting my husband and I on how we were dressed.

The sides were good for sharing.  Brussels sprouts and carrots along with the mac and cheese were very good.  Service is top notch.  We never were needing anything and always attempted to.  Great location with a view of the water show.",

When check in, I also remind the host that I had reservation for patio, she told me that she knew.  When sit, they walk us to a corner table inside by the kitchen. Again, I remind the host that I had reserved the patio sitting. Her respond \" oh! Wait here.\" When we finally get our table at the patio, we have to clean our own cushion. Caused it was so dirty. While we sit and wait for our waiter/waitress, I noticed all the customers do the same \"clean their own chair\" before sitting down, while the waiter'/waitress stand around and chit chat. It take awhile for our waiter/waitress, and every time we need something, we have to raise our hand. They never come by the table to check on us. However, the bus boy did come and check on us. As for food I have the chicken and it very bland, no flavor. We will not be coming back. Don't recommend this restaurant for the price and service you pay.",

There is no better resort than Wynn/Encore and no better steak joint than SW.  Thank you, Mr. Wynn!",

Not the case with the service we received tonight. We had to ask to order, ask to order another bottle of wine, pour our own wine, ask for plates to be removed when done, ask for dessert menus, etc etc etc.  Very disappointing.",

When we arrived at 6:00 pm, we were promptly seated by the most beautiful African American Hostess in the world. She was unbelievably attractive, polished and professional looking. I'm talking modelesque here people. If you go here you'll immediately know who I'm taking about. Anyway, make reservations as the restaurant fills up quickly.  We sat outside on a perfect Vegas night. It was probably in the high 60's. The patio was heated but the heaters weren't on and they weren't needed that night. The tables outside are the best seats in the restaurant. The tables are lake front and the show on the lake that takes place every 20 minutes was really cool to watch.   My friends have raved about the bread here. The bread basket consisted of French rolls, pretzel rolls and two bacon rolls. Although the bacon rolls were savory they were also dense and filling. I actually preferred the pretzel rolls. The wedge salad was the best wedge salad I've ever had. It is great to split between two people, and comes with an insanely thick slice of bacon. You can't go wrong with any of the steaks, but I went with the 12 oz filet. It was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I would compare it to Fleming's quality not Mastro's or Cut. The kobe butter they bring out on the side it's rich and delicious. I actually preferred it over the 3 sauces; bearnaise, steak, and jalapeno passion fruit sauces that were also brought out with the steaks. However, you don't really need them as they just mask the flavor of the steak.    The service was great and the waiters were very attentive. This wasn't the best steakhouse I've ever been to, but I'm glad I experienced SW.",

I'll make this review about this particular night:  She had a prawn? daily special and seriously it was the largest and scariest shrimp I have ever seen in my life. That single shrimp was bigger than a small lobster. I did not take a photo of it because it grossed me out so much...anyway...she said it was wonderful.   Father in law ordered a steak of some kind and he said it was the best steak he has ever eaten before.   Hubby ordered the roasted vegan mushroom entree and wow it was amazing. It had about $50 of beautiful roasted mushrooms. He also ordered a small house salad prior.  I started off with the vegan mushroom soup which was a wonderful creamy delight. Thick, warm and yummy I crave this and try to replicate it at home.  For my entree I ordered the quinoa cakes. The portion is huge.  I always love the vegan cheesecake for dessert and for this particular birthday night they brought out a huge piece of cheesecake for her.   Perfection. Every time.",

But I can't bring myself to give SW more than 3 stars because I would rather save $106 and pay a little more for a simpler steak! I prefer my steak to be simple so I can taste the beef. The chili rubbed ribeye has a lot of spice which I think takes away from really enjoying the meat.  The beat salad here is very tasty, if you like beets. My favorite side dish is the truffle creamed corn. Delicious! The scallops and risotto are also a good choice. Definitely save room for dessert too. Last time I was here, I had the funnel cake (which everyone orders) and the warm sticky toffee pudding. The pudding is really good!!  Service at SW is great and everyone is very attentive, which they should be if you're spending that much for your dinner. It's also nice to be able to sit by the Wynn waterfall and watch the show that takes place every half hour. If I come back, I think I'll try a different steak so I can write a better review.",

THe steaks here are the best I have ever had and is why we keep coming back.  My bf gets the new york strip and he eats it without his usual A1 cause it has just so much natural flavor and is super juicy so need for anything but a side to go with it like theere creamy mash potatoes are also very good.  I have tried there steeak as well and their lobster pasta dish whihc were both very good and very filling.  The lobster pasta dish was very full of flavor amd creamy and not over powering like i thought it might be .  They also have this wedge house salad that is freaking awesome and is great to split between two people it had basically a head of lettuce cut in half and then served with tomatoes and this nice thick cut clice of bacon and an swesome ranch sauce.  We get this everytime.  The portions are very good size, and pricing isnt bad compared to the rest of the steakhouse on the strip.  Plus what i really like is we maade a reservation for one time but wasnt going to be able to make it to an emergency so we called and they said they could push it back for us to whatever time we would like and that if we need to call back and push it back further cause of the emergency they could do that as well.  Which was great considering we were going there for our anniversary dinner. We had to clal and push it back twice and it was extremely busy for the summer and on the weekend and we didnt have to wait or anything.   This place is nice no matter where you sit but if you can sit outside and see the show they have out there, its worth it . Will be coming back to this place for some awesome food this summer and i can't wait  my mouth is watering already.",

The staff were awesome about keeping their cool that they got my note about the bday and didn't even say anything to me that they could do a little something for the occasion. Everything tasted amazing. Presentation was lovely and staff were very attentive (to the point I jumped when they came out of nowhere to refill a glass that just dipped below half full). Our waitress (I forgot her name but I know she's from upstate NY and she was great!) helped our friend who wanted to try lobster into trying it and was very attentive to all his questions - he loved it btw. My husband had a filet mignon that melted in his mouth!  I've never tried a steak that nice before and we've tried a few of the upper end steakhouse out here. His lobster tail was also very nice - being from the East coast we take our seafood seriously and this was prepared just right, we were impressed. When we were all done and didn't order dessert (I had a cake at home) they brought out a French macaroon with a candle for him. It was the perfect, sneaky ending to a great bday dinner.",

We had a porterhouse for two people and we were not able to finish it. The wine list is great and they have a great selection of Barolo.   The view is spectacular, the restaurant is located right in front of the Lake of Dreams in Wynn. When you make the reservation, do remember to ask for the table next by the window so you could have a full view of the Lake while you are enjoying the food.",

    "text": "While in Vegas for a conference last week, my company treated us to dinner at SW Steakhouse and while the steaks were fantastic, the rest of the meal left us lacking.  The waiting area is extremely small and there are only about 6 stools in the bar, so large-ish groups like ours (5 at the time, 7 in total), can find themselves standing around for quite a bit.  Once seated, the service was extremely slow as we sat, ready to order but unattended to for at least fifteen minutes.  The wine that was recommended to us, although okay, was nothing special and, they only had two bottles, meaning we had to switch mid-way thorough the meal.  Every quality steakhouse I've ever been to has always notified us of a low inventory BEFORE serving the wine, especially when we've had a group of 5-7 people.  Not a major issue with SW but it just shows a lack of finesse, especially when paying a minimum of $54 for an a la carte steak.  On to the food...  As I mentioned, the steaks are FANTASTIC.  The veal chop that was ordered by a fellow diner also received rave reviews.  I had the smallest steak offered, a 9oz filet, cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Another diner had the same steak only cooked medium well and his only (small issue) was that had specifically requested it be cooked with a thin line of pink and there was no pink at all.  But, he had zero complaints on the flavor or the texture - it was buttery and juicy and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rib-eyes were ordered by the rest of the table and all greatly enjoyed their steaks.  As with most (all?) high-end steakhouses, all sides are ordered a la carte.  At SW, the sides are $12 each with the sauteed wild mushrooms and grilled asparagus being the exception as they are $16 each.  All the sides are large enough to share but the potatoes gratin is quite small and unless everyone takes a very small portion, it would only serve 3.  And although the rest of the sides we ordered - creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms and black truffle creamed corn - were more than enough to serve all 7 of us, I have to wonder if that was due to the poor quality of the sides. No one went back for seconds on anything except the mushrooms. I can say that I highly recommend them,  The potatoes gratin came out lukewarm with the cheesy crust already solidified.  The potatoes were undercooked and we had to use a knife to remove the servings as the spoon was unable to cut through the hard potatoes.  The creamed spinach was not creamy. At all. It was all water without any of the normal creamy goodness that you expect to be clinging to the spinach.  It was swimming in water when it came to the table and once spooned on the plate, the water went everywhere, affecting all the servings on the plate.  The black truffle creamed corn was just weird. The black truffle, of which I am normally a HUGE fan, was just misplaced here.  It was almost like an afterthought and simply added to attempt to validate $12 for a $3 dish.  The corn itself was just mush. There were no kernels of plump, sweet corn and in mid-summer, the height of corn season, that's just sacrilege.   The grilled asparagus were thick and perfectly grilled and perhaps with a seafood dish they would have been more well received.  Or in hindsight, squeezing some fresh lemon on them would have probably made a world of difference.  Their charred smokey flavor too closely resembled that of the steaks and therefore they didn't have any real oomph of their own.  A drizzle of  Hollandaise would have also given them their own identity.   All in all, I would not go back here again unless invited (and paid for) by someone else.  Cut by Wolfgang Puck will be my next LV steakhouse adventure.  If invited back to SW again, I would at least make sure that we had a table with a view of the Lake of Dreams show. The little peeks that we were able to catch from the corner of our table were very impressive.",

    "text": "AMAZING!  This place is seriously one of the BEST places I have ever been to in the United States.  If you are ever in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and stop here.  My friends & I made reservations the night before.  We were seated right away when we arrived on a busy Friday night.  Our waiter, Christopher, was very welcoming and friendly.  He was attentive all through dinner and made sure that everything was OK.   We ended up ordering 4 different meals to share: big eye tuna ceviche, seafood spectacular, ribeye steak, and crab cake.  The ceviche was delicious.  It just melted in your mouth as soon as it touched your lips.  Best ceviche I have ever had.  The seafood spectacular was the best thing that we had.  It was a combination of jumbo shrimp, oysters, crab legs, and a crab salad.  All the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  No other seafood compared to what we had here during our trip.  The ribeye steak was perfect.  Charred to perfection on the outside and juicy in the middle.  Orgasmic.  There is not much to say about the crab cake.  It was kind of a disappointment compared to the rest of the food.  But despite that, I still give this place 5 stars.  I will be back here for sure during my next trip to Vegas.  I wish there was a Chicago location!",

    "text": "Ok, so great environment.  The dinner shows are pretty unique and entertaining.  Food- if I could give 0 stars I would. Maybe It was my high expectations but Damn it was bad.  We were a group of 7 and we were foodies on a mission.  (Tried kabuto omakase which was awesome, try to hagashi chu toro, foodgaism in your mouth!!!)  What we had(6 steaks, 1 couple shared, and 5 out of 6 steaks were overcooked, including my $330.00 kobe beef:( very sad)  1. Kobe beef- 6oz, $50-55 per oz. Ordered rare- so supposedly 1 out of the 3 steakhouses in the US that serves authentic kobe beef from kobe,  japan. I don't know if I was scammed or the cook was horrible, but 1st the meet was not as Marbled as expected, meaning the fat on the kobe beef should be marbled evenly throughout the piece of meat. The fat of the kobe beef should literally melts in your mouth even if it wasn't cooked. I believe the fat of kobe beef melts at like 65 degrees or something like that. (Did some research before eating it lol) I asked for a rare kobe beef (usually get medium rare for kobe beef) but the beef came out over cooked, close to medium. Also, instead of one piece of meat at 6oz, they cut it into 2 piece?!?! What was that about? For such a expensive beef you would think they wouldn't want to waste or provide an overcooked meat, but sure enough they did. Once the meat came out, the steak overall was not what I've tasted in the past. Either wynn/sw is fake or the place I've been to in the past is fake. (Killians in Houston)  2nd chili crusted steak - rare- ok and cooked consistently all the way around, some pieces were overcooked, like medium well, but the worst offense was meat was chewy as hell. The seasoning was awesome on some parts but than other parts was overloaded with the seasoning.  3rd tomahawk ribeye- rare- rare on half the meat, but the the other part was like medium well. Biggest offense was the meat in the bone portion was over well done. Great steakhouses who serve bone in ribeye makes the meat on  the bone perfectly cooked and delicious. Meaning if ordered rare, than the meat on the bone should be rare also.  4th, cheatuebrian steak - ordered rare, came out well done. Sent it back and even our waiter was like wtf. By the time it was ready to come out, we were all done so we said no to the 2nd one (actually, the waiter didn't even place the order and came by about 30 minutes and was like ummmmm...do you still want the steak? ....no)  5th all natural rib eye (not bone in) from ururaguy or some place. OK but ordered rare, but still came out medium.  We ordered 4 to 5 sides and the eyes were ok at best. Off the menu mushroom risotto was the best.  Dessert- a moth decided to kamakeze my gf in the eye and pretty much added on to the epic disaster of a dinner.  I don't know if we were scammed with the quality of beef or if the chef that night was just off or what. Very disappointed.  We though of going to mizumi sushi at the wynn, but after sw we were like hell no. Kabuto off the strip was superb (hagashi chu toro!!! $$$)  Wine was good though, LA sirena,  but paid close go 300 per bottle. Ice wine they had was pretty good for dessert  Anyhow, if anyone knows of a legit good steak house let me know because next time I'm in vegas, never going back to sw.",

The first server seemed to lack the attention span or the willingness to give us any attention.  He was better off speaking with others working at  the restaurant.  The second server seemed a little more attentive, but he never introduced himself.  On with the food, the 9oz filet was mouth watering and just melted in my mouth.  Second was the bone-in rib eye which had the same mouth melting characteristics with a little bit of marbled fat for flavor.  The new york bone-in was pretty good as well, but it may have been a little too chewey.  All meats were served rare as requested.  For the sides, the black truffled cream corn had hints of corn but otherwise seemed like a corn chowder, although still pretty good.  The asparagus was good as well, large pieces.",

For apps your musts should be: Crab legs, oysters, shrimp. Best I've ever had.  If it's cold, all of the soups are bomb too.  For entrees: Steak-obviouslyyyy-I love the filet. Scallops are also Delicious here.  For sides: Truffle cream corn (so unique) and french fries.  For Dessert: Everything! The molten chocolate cake, the donuts & strawberries w/dipping sauces, the cakes, OMG everything is amazing!!!!  Not only is the food out of this world, but you get to sit with a view of \"The Lake of Dreams\" as Steve Wynn calls it, and watch many amazing water shows every 30 minutes. Make sure you get a seat where you can clearly see the waterfall as that's where all the shows are projected on to.  Hopefully the chef is reading this review b/c there are 2 minor dishes that need to be tweaked here: the mac n cheese side and the tuna tartare app. We've been dining here long enough to know that the mac n cheese has gone through 2 changes, and honestly this has never been a side worth ordering here, but that needs to change! Please change the recipe again chef! Something with 4 hearty cheeses, thick consistency, and a very light breadcrumb crust would be FAB!  Tried the tuna tartare app this past time, and it was unfortunately flavorless.   Can't go wrong with SW; we go several times a year.  1 of my friends is a Billionaire, and he often flys his private jet to Vegas just to eat here...LOL-jk, but he wishes and so do we!!!",

I did some researching before deciding on where I wanted to eat my birthday dinner and I finally settled on SW because I read a magazine article that said they were the only restaurant in the US that had the license to serve real Kobe beef from Japan.  We made reservations to sit on the patio and even though they couldn't guarantee a seat on the patio, we got one anyway.  The weather outside was perfect, our server was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly.  For an appetizer we shared the seafood platter but we also received an assortment of breads and it seemed like every bite we took was more delicious than the last.  Then my steak arrived and it was phenomenal, I savored each succulent bite.  At some point a huge frog emerged from the waterfall and lip synced Louis Armstrong's Wonderful Life.  We stopped to enjoy the moment and take in the words of the song, it made me grateful for my surroundings.  This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in my life and it was due to the delicious food, our amazing server and a giant frog of all things.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at SW steak for the 1st time on 4/21/17 after seeing Le Reve (which was absolutely incredible). The best way to sum up this review is by saying it was just OK. Unfortunately, I was expecting great. I wanted it to be an experience that left us in awe so bad and it just...didn't. We sat outside by the water and the staff were very friendly. There were several large parties around us so it felt like we were forgotten at times but service was still good. For our app we ordered the foie gras. It was good but the other ingredients were the star rather than the actual foie gras but still good. For our main courses I ordered the ribeye \"chili rubbed\" and my wife the scallops. We shared a side of scalloped potatoes that were recommend by the server. The scallops were good but just weren't real hot. Maybe they had sat for a while before being brought out to us. The steak was by far the biggest disappointment. How could the \"best thing I ever ate\" be bad? First, the chili rub was a thick paste slathered on top. It had the flavors of any local Mexican restaurant. It wasn't cooked or seared on the steak. Maybe I should have asked but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting. Next, it was the cut of meat that was the real disappointment. I have honestly had better ribeyes at Outback. It was very very fatty and tough. About half of the steak (fat) was left on the plate...inedible. The potatoes were also nothing special at all. At one point I bit down on a hard bone like piece in the potatoes. I still don't know what it was but needless to say that was my last bite of potatoes. Finally, the ambiance outside was great, that is, until the \"shows\" came on. They were just plain silly. Any feeling of a \"high end\" restaurant goes completely out the window when the giant frog comes out and starts singing \"friends in low places\". Overall my expectations were to have a memorable meal...one that we would always remember and unfortunately it was a let down. The only thing I will remember is how much we spent for a subpar meal.",

I took off a star just for the fact that I hate it when you got to fancy steakhouses and you pay $50 for a steak all by its lonseome on a plate- that's it. Not only does it look silly as presentation, it is just ridiculous to not offer a side with a $50 steak. That being said-it is a fine dining experience you will not regret.",

The night we went here, it wasn't that busy but our server pretty much forgot all about us. We heard her chatting with the other table next to us and decided that since they were ordering the $135.00 steak, she thought they were more worthy of her time than we were. My steak was alright, nothing special and I have had better. Our sides were ok as well. I don't think I would go here again because if I had the money, I would go to Delmonico's in the Venetian instead.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place, especially since Steve Wynn has his name (or initials, at least) attached to it. After eating at many A-plus steakhouses in NY and NJ, I was expecting the same, if not better in terms of food quality and ambience. SW left me feeling rather cold, though.   First of all, the atmosphere is kind of dull. Yes, the restaurant opens up to the \"Lake of Dreams\", but if you don't sit outside or near the door, like we didn't, then you don't get to see any bit of the lake or the waterfall. The interior of the restaurant is kind of sparse and cavernous, and just didn't feel very comfortable. Unfortunately, the food was no better:   Appetizer: Caesar salad. Meh -- nothing special about this. Just your basic Caesar salad.  Main Course: Rack of Lamb. Sad to say, this was not good at all. While the flavor was good, the lamb was loaded with fat and there were two pieces that I could barely eat at all. I know, I know, you go to a steakhouse to eat steak and not lamb, right? Well, the lamb is on the menu, so it should be just as good as everything else. And this was not.   Dessert: No thanks. I was still turned off by the lamb.   All in all, not a very satisfying experience. I'm sure there are other steakhouses in Vegas that are much more worth my time.",

    "text": "I know, I know . . . two stars for SW . . . shame.  But SW just did not live up to the hype and prices.  I was expecting to be launched out of this world . . . instead I got a pretty lame bounce on a pogo stick.  Um, Mr. Wynn, what drug-induced over-priced Madison Avenue design firm did you hire for this place? Krap and Ass-ociates? Dude, it was like walking into a cross between some stupid buffet and a government cafeteria. OK, I get that places can be crowded - I really do. But when you are a freakin' high end, supposed top of the food chain restaurant, cramming the peeps into a space that's no bigger than some super-mall DMV office is just wrong. One should be able to walk with some serenity between tables. Uh-uh, not at SW. Look, I'll admit I'm certainly not the smallest tree in the forest, but this place made me feel like a freaking super sized redwood. A regular sized male should, in an upscale restaurant, heck, even in a regular scale restaurant, be able to fit nicely between tables with little to no effort . . . but not here. Maybe that's supposed to be part of the experience - getting head-cocked by strangers, literally. Ooops, excuse me ma'am, didn't mean to put the package in your face . . .  Anyway, I hadn't tasted the food yet, so, again, I let the design and decor issues wash away.  We sat down and waited. Soon, I believe three or four or five different servers came to our table - I'm not sure who was in charge. I think eventually they just left us with some cute girl who didn't quite belong as a waiter in that place.  First up, appetizers. We ordered some sort of seafood platter. This was good - very fresh.  I should have stopped right there - had I done so, SW would have gotten 4 stars.  Up next was salad. For me, nothing says steakhouse than a perfect Caesar. I did not get that at SW. Whoever made my Caesar there should be brought up on charges of first degree saladcide. Since when did it become OK to make a salad with more parts dressing than salad? Really? This is supposed to be good? I swear I could hear the anchovies crying. Sorry little guys.  I definitely should have stopped right there.  Down to three stars.  Instead, I had the great pleasure of being served one of the most disappointing cuts of meat EVER. Forget the piece of dog shank I got at Golden Steer last year - this thing they served me was a joke. I will admit I had set up expectations quite high - really - I mean I wanted this steak to be so good that I could cut open a slit on the side and French kiss the juices out of it. I wanted to LOVE the steak. I wished it would be so good that I would have to right then and there declare my undying love and book a honeymoon suite . . . .  Nope.  I got burned.  Internally, I wept. How could SW have turned into such a turd? It was not fair. I took about four bites of my steak before deciding I had had enough and did not want to risk barfing on the restaurant floor. I noted that some of the other crew did enjoy their steaks a little more - but nobody was floored.  Tale of the tape? Six dudes, appetizers, salads, steaks, and I believe four sides, plus three or four bottles of wine . . . . $140 bucks a piece.  Final judgment - If you are looking for a steak joint that has the following qualities, then by all means, go right ahead and book a table at SW:  (a) Elitist front desk personnel who make no effort to seat patrons in a timely manner;  (b) Elitist front bar waiters who display attitude when you cannot think of what you want to drink within .025 seconds;  (c) A dining room so overcrowded with people that it requires Mission Impossible-like stealth to maneuver between tables and chairs;  (d) Decor that is reminiscent of the very best that your local Wal-Mart deli or Circle K hot dog bar has to offer.  (e) Waiters who don't get jokes and certainly don't understand tongue in cheek sarcasm;  (f) Saladcide in the first degree.  (g) Steak that tastes like it was cooked under the hood of an old Buick.  Can I find anything good to say about this place? Yes. As I said above, the seafood appetizer was good. Oh, and I did like the men's bathroom. I swear the stall doors hermitically sealed themselves.  That was cool.",

    "text": "This is hands down the best steak experience I've had in LV (for a casual quick steak fix that's always solid, N9NE steakhouse would be my other choice).  SW has everything I'm looking for in a 5-star restaurant: nice decor, spacious and comfortable seating, attentive and informed staff, full bar and extensive wine list, and of course, excellent food.  Try to set aside a couple hours to enjoy your meal as they purposely don't rush you here (especially if you plan to run through a couple bottles of red).  I've had one dinner that lasted easily three hours here one time (it's that relaxing here).  This is a great place to take a date or celebrate any occasion.  Anyhow, here are my dining comments:  Wine: Ok, everyone has their own favorite varietals and labels so I won't go much further here...just wanted to mention that everytime I've asked the sommelier to surprise me based on the type of wine I like, I've never been disappointed. Appetizers: -Oysters on the half shell (the seafood here is always fresh and this always hits the spot on those hot Vegas nights) -Kobe Beef Carpaccio (it's good but nothing special) -Foie Gras (If you're a fan, I recommend you try it as I thought this was excellent) Entrees: Well this is a steakhouse so I've never honestly ordered otherwise but I have tried a friend's roasted sea scallops and they were pretty darn good. -Bone-in 20oz Ribeye (this is a home run) -Porterhouse (this is good when on a date as it's meant for two) -Veal Chop (juicy and tender but gets 8 out of 10 stars) Whatever meat you end up eating, make sure you order all three sauces on the side (Bearnaise, Jalapeno Tropical Fruit, and the SW Original). All the sides are ordered separately and I usually go for the garlic broccolini, au-gratin potatoes, or the creamed spinach.  Last time my friend ordered some french fries and when dipped in the bearnaise, it's pretty good. Dessert: I've always gotten the Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake which takes about 15-30 minutes to prepare so order it with your entree (Dr. Mean has made me a fan of this dessert). Misc: Reservations are always helpful but not necessary.  Expect to spend upwards of $100-200+ a head depending on how much you plan on spending on wine.  I've seen ppl get away with shorts here but it is a 5-star restaurant so dress accordingly.  Lastly, don't bother with trying to get a window seat to watch the waterfall show, it's pretty lame...unless you sit outside when it's not too hot.",

I wanted to hire the waiter to come teach the wait staff in Miami (where I live) what real service looks like. He knew that silverware crossed on your plate means your still eating and he was polite and efficient. We had a mistake with one of the caviars we ordered and the waiter graciously gave us a new order (that's three caviars people). The caviar was fantastic but I love caviar. Grilled shrimp was brushed with a perfectly flavored lemongrass sauce and all the sides were terrific: fries, onions and jalapenos, cream corn, etc. And now presenting the steak: normally, new york strip is tough and for this reason I don't eat it. However, my husband's steak was soft, buttery and delicious. For me, the top is a little too charred but everyone else at the table thought it was great. The lobster was terrific as well. Overall, I really liked this place but if I had to spend close to $500 dollars here to eat I might have thought differently. Cocktails and ambience rocked as well.",

Make sure you ask for the \"great tables\" during reservation.  Tell them you're a star or you're bringing a star or a CEO or whatever.  You're going to want a great view for this show.

    "text": "Went to the SW for a Monday night dinner with colleagues. None of us had been here before. The appetizers were fairly meh, quite frankly. We got the Seafood Spectacular (mix of a king crab legs, shrimp, scallops, oysters, and something else that we couldn't determine what it was). The side dishes themselves were also bland and unexciting. We got the black truffle creamed corn (barely any black truffle taste, more runny than creamy.) Ok, so why the 4 stars then? Everything I've written so far should be indicative of 3 stars... maybe. The steak... wow. Well, this place IS called a steakhouse for a reason. I had the 9 ounce fillet, medium (I know, how boring... but I wasn't super hungry and my significant other didn't want to share the chateaubriand). It was perfectly seared, the perfect color of red/pink in the middle, tasted heavenly and once the plate was empty, not a single drop of blood to be found. OH, I cannot believe what an amazing steak that was. Finally, the desserts were fairly meh as the chocolate layer cake, vanilla creme brulee, and peanut butter banana fudge brownie were just okay.",

    "text": "The bf and I decided to check out SW, a steakhouse named specially after the man himself, Steven Wynn. Our reservations were on Monday night at 8:30pm and when we arrived, we were asked to sit and wait. The restaurant was full of what looked to be like groups of businessmen having dinner after work and old married couples. We had to wait 20 mins for our table so I was expecting this to be a great experience with it being so busy on a Monday night and filled with people that seemed like regulars. The first strike was our table, we usually like to sit next to eachother but they placed us at a table where you had to sit across from eachother and it was unusually long, making it harder to hold a conversation. In addition, we got stuck in the corner right next to the kitchen. With the night being so full, it was obvious and understandable our server would be busy but he was not attentive at all.  The bf ordered the lamb chops ($42) cooked medium with creamed corn ($10) as the side. It was cooked right and not gamey at all for him, but he didn't like the bleu cheese crust on it. The creamed corn was ok, it was a bit too liquidy/runny for my taste.  I ordered the appetizer portion of the lobster fettucine for $18, their dinner size was $36. My dish was good, the lobster was meaty and plentiful. The appetizer portion was about the size of your hand but it was filling enough for me.  For dessert we decided on their selection of homemade ice creams and sorbets. Our choice of 3, we chose passion-fruit mango, lemoncello gelato, and mixed berry. The passion-fruit mango was very sour, we couldn't even finish it. The lemoncello gelato tasted like vanilla bean with a lemon kick aftertaste. The mixed berry was the winner of the 3. It wasn't too sour or sweet but a good balance, the bf said it reminded him of a dole ice cream bar.  All in all, I don't think this place is as great as it is hyped up to be. The food was alright. The hostesses seemed snobby. Our server wasn't friendly. He walked past us several times after it was obvious we were ready for the bill. This was an experience but definitely not a restaurant where we'll be having dinner again.",

I had ordered my steak medium-rare and it was somewhat unevenly cooked, but I think this may have been due to the size (gigantic) of the steak.   The sides were okay-- all were quite small which I thought was silly and annoying.  The potatoes au gratin were awesome.  The asparagus and mushrooms were so-so. The chocolate souffle was amazing.  The funnel cake was disgusting.  It was over-fried and tasted only of oil.  There is no reason this should be so inferior to an amusement park. The sommelier helped us pick out an amazing wine which was one of the very few bottles that was under $100.   The service was barely adequate.  For a fine-dining experience, I expect a waiter who is knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  Ours was none of these. For the steak and wine, 5 stars. Sides, dessert, service, 2 stars.",

Two caveats, 1. expect truly pricey (about $100 pp without wine), and 2. although the grotto/minilake is a beautiful setting and a lovely view, there is a \"show\" put on every half hour or hour that is way below the elegance of the restaurant--it is clearly \"cheesy\". It's not a part of the restaurant, but I would suggest getting a table AWAY from the view unless you have a easy going sense of humor. As to some of the mediocre reviews, either the restaurant had an off day, or the reviewer has a spoiled and pampered off life. :)",
