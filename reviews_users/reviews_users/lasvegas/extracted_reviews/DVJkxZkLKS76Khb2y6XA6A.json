The place its self is pretty cool i like all the pictures they got up on the walls & and the massive tv. i got the Aloha Burger with sweet potatoes on the side. The burger was a bit dry the chicken was a bit over cooked in my opinion. I also think its a bit pricy. Idk maybe next time ill have a better experience!",

Even better I pay for it and sit down and the owner tells the cashier to come up to me and say we're out. Really?? You can't even come up to me and say it yourself. Oh it even gets better they offer to make me a bowl for $8 without acai... CRAZY! I asked when they would receive acai they said they didn't know. So instead of eating healthy I went to bread and butter so i wouldn't be so pissed after having a sugar high. Never ever coming here again.",

First issue was with the staff with a bad attitude/bad service.  She didn't even say hello and seemed annoyed like she didn't want to be working.  Second issue was with the staff completely forgeting our order.  And it wasn't even busy.  We had to ask the cook (rude staff person was no help).  He did his best to rush the order.   Finally issue was that they completely forgot the juice that we ordered.  We almost had to get out our receipt to prove we ordered a juice, which was disappointing.      It was $30 for two people and one juice, which is a little high for ok food and bad service.  Definitely a bad experience.    On a good note, the place seemed clean and in order.  It seems like a good concept,  we just didn't fit in with the \"meathead/gym culture\" which seems to be the tone of the place.    Also if you are not wearing gym clothes, enter at your own risk.  Weird place.",

No high chairs though so it seems not a kid friendly place.  I guess people that work out done eat out with their kids?? I was bugged by that.",

I have never had such tender meat. It was really so good. I ate the whole thing - though it easily could have been spread over 2 meals. We also ordered the pancakes to go and had them later. Just as good heated up I'm sure as they would have been in the restaurant. Steady flow of traffic which means they are doing well! :)",

    "text": "I think I am one of the first to get to experience this place and let me just say ..ah now this is what I needed. It's like a Tropical Smoothie meets Greens and Proteins meets Coffee Shop that was spliced with a healthy Egg Works. Lots of options meat, salads and vegetarian dishes, breakfast, coffee, smoothies. I can see this as being a healthy option for those doing shows, working out, training for fights, on Paleo or looking to indulge while staying healthy.  I ordered three things, I like to eat what can I say? The best I can do to stifle my inner fat kid is to force-feed him healthy meals a majority of the time. 3 steps forward, one step back. Anyway, I got the bison cheeseburger, PH breakfast, and BBQ chicken bowl with quinoa (with BBQ sauce flavored with stevia instead of sugar, damn they're on it for those of you that like to drizzle sauce all over your food). A little more expensive from most places but about on par when I'm ordering things like bison, which isn't cheap. When I first started eating it, of course I wanted to compare it to Greens and Proteins but it's not really the same thing. Greens and protein is healthy and has good health alternatives for vegans and vegetarians but outside of several items it lacks sufficient protein options for me. So where Greens and Proteins lacks Protein House makes up in protein (meat, chicken, egg whites), alternatives for customized shakes, and smoothies, and easier to stay within how my friends and I eat. So can't really compare the two, they're both good. It's like comparing apples and oranges, both fruit, but they are both in different categories.    In any event, they're still working out some kinks but this place has the potential to continue expanding and get better. Now I know some of you picky eaters will complain that it's just okay but I also heard this from the same person who dislikes fish and complains at sushi restaurants. Wtf! Hey it might just not be your thing. But it's simple, if you need your protein, you need your veggies, you need your carbs and you need healthy, this is the spot. This isn't necessarily a place I would go to indulge but it is exactly the place I would go to keep me on track during the week so I can indulge later in the weekend. (See fat kid reference above.)",

More than willing to come back and have another meal but the price of the food and quality/taste may not be too worth it for me... I am also not a fan of the atmosphere. I like the layout, tables, colors and flooring but the music is loud and makes me feel like I am out at the club. I, by no means am a person who wants peace and quiet but it is too loud to enjoy a conversation with someone I am with and I am sorry but the photos on the wall are just interesting... I understand it is a health and fitness conscious establishment and I am all about it and love that but the photos on the wall are over the top fitness pictures. (Sorry I forgot to take a photo, it would help explain my thoughts) And this is a very casual place. All in all, not bad but I will drive 5 minutes down the street to greens and proteins. Usually my go to for a healthy dish.",

The woman at the counter was rude and short with us- I told her it was our first time and she handed me a paper menu, not explaining anything or asking any questions.  You'd think they would want new customers but based off her attitude that was clearly not the goal. We both decided on acai bowls.  They were absolutely phenomenal- five stars for food. It's unfortunate the customer service didn't match the food. My husband is a professional athlete so we were hoping we'd found a new \"spot.\"",

You have options of vegetables for your sides. You have different protein meat options. You can even choose how much protein or sides you want. For instance, 9oz. of bison, 1 cup of brown rice. If you're on meal prepping, this place is even more perfect. You can many anything work for your macro intake. Most importantly, you can place your meal prep orders here. They have a meal prep menu. You can customized your meals and they actually measure your food properly so you don't go over or below you macro intake. Everything on the menu from breakfast, to smoothies, bowls, salads, proteins shakes, coffee, cookies, brownies, lunch and dinners is simply PERFECT! Seriously!!!! If you want to eat or need the protein intake, this place is for you. They make protein pancakes with protein syrup, coffee protein shakes. My favorite is \"Vanilla Gorilla\". This place is for everyone. I take my entire family here and mg kids love it here too. They love the protein pancakes, the protein brownies, the steak and much more. They also carry meal prep bags large and small with containers inside of them plays the ice packs to freeze. They also have workout gear for both male and females and hats. They have sale what you need for before, after, or during gym sessions. They have protein shaker cups, water bottles, all kinds of fitness drinks and even coconut water. They great natural juices with BCAAs and natural teas. The water they serve isn't like other restaurants. There water actually tastes good and clean too. I can keep going. This is Olaf was sooooo perfect, I would love to o w day be a franchise PH owner. I love a healthy lifestyle and this restaurant is just perfect for my lifestyle and it can be perfect for you too. Please try this place at least once. You won't regret it. One more thing, they now do catering. What more can you ask for? and all of their ingredients are fresh too. Another new thing they have now are healthy shots. For example, ginger tumeric etc. Shots. Literally everything they offer is healthy for you and your entire family.",

She took my card and rung it up from her register. She told me the owner has had problems with cards that swipe (normal credit cards) and only excepts cards with chips in the future. The chip takes longer and is just as susceptible to hackers as the old cards. They are just inconvenient. There's literally zero advantage to using them.

It consists of two HUGE chocolate chip pancakes topped with bananas, walnuts and sugar free chocolate sauce. It was delicious but with a bit too much of an artificial sweetness to it. I could only eat half since they were so big plus loaded with protein.  I wish they used all natural ingredients though. That was a downer in my opinion.  I also ordered a Southwest Bowl to-go. Lean steak with black beans, veggies and brown rice. I had that later on my ride home. So fresh and good!  I really enjoyed the food there although I was disappointed with the quality of the protein powder they use for their pancakes and other recipes. It contain artificial sweeteners and ingredients that are not healthy, so even though the pancakes were high in protein and sugar free, I still considered them \"unhealthy.\" I think Protein House has a great thing going, but they should change the brand of protein the use to make it TRULY a healthy eating place.",

I usually just come for a post workout smoothie. I typically get the Green Blast, which is lower in carbs. Their plant powered bowl was everything. I got my veggies, quinoa, and protein. They provide a nutrition menu to account for macros. They have options for bread like wheat, Ezekiel (which is good for my blood sugar). It's 5 minutes away from EOS and Vegas Discount Nutrition. Great location and food. Service has always been great. It's worth a try, so just venture out here and order something.  The only thing I would recommend is making the portobello mushroom buns a little softer!",

We ordered the: S.O.S, $11.99 Grilled Salmon, Spring Mix, Grapes,Celery, Apples, Walnuts, Feta, and balsamic vinaigrette. I loved it, the Salmon was moist and great testing, the fruit and veggie combination was perfect, so was the vinaigrette.  The SHRRD Salad $11.99 Chicken, Quinoa,Spring Mix, Cucumber, Baby Tomato, Spinach, Avocado, Peas, Hard Boiled Egg, Balsamic Vinaigrette My husband loved it! Chicken was tasty the veggies and everything in it was delish. Couple of hours after lunch the Salmon was still in my mind!  My husband was making plans for our next lunch there.  The place was clean, neat and quite. The food is well worth the price you pay. I just feel they need a larger menu board.",

Cashier had no personality, didn't feel welcoming at all. I waited 30 min for my juice! It was an hour before closing after a workout, they were slow and 3-4 customers after me got served before I did. And they ordered food! It was near closing and I finally asked the other employee where my drink was. She was apologetic and the one who helped me didn't even bother to apologize. I'll stick to Greens and Proteins for better service, better food and ambience! The folks at Circle K have better attitude and service!",

Same thing when asked what white dishes do you guys have? Is there oil in that sauce? What about sugar? These things are important for people on specific meal plans. It's frustrating when you do not know anything and seem too annoyed to find out. Though the food is good I'm afraid to eat it in fear that it will have something I specified I can't have.

There was only one other person in there who already had their order so it seemed like it took a bit too long to throw together two chicken Caesar salads. Salad was alright, but skimpy on the dressing. Not sure what they were using as the \"lite\" dressing we think it hurt our bellies afterwards. For the price I would have hoped that at least the lettuce was organic, but I don't think it was. The atmosphere was not what I expected - and the EDM music was way too loud. I'm all about eating healthy, but this place was more annoying than anything else.   Also - read the menu before you go in. A lot of the sauces or parts of dishes include things that may not be ideal to one's diet such as stevia, agave nectar, etc. I guess it just comes down to your own personal diet preferences.",

My favorite thing is...well anything with bison. Bison helps make Protein House unique; a lean meat that they serve many different ways (from in a breakfast bowl to a burger). And lots of vegan options for my vegan friends/clients.  As a personal trainer I have sent a number of my clients to protein house after a workout...I tell them what they need (as far as carbs, protein amount etc) & typically one of the staff members or the owner will help choose the right shake for them. No one has been disappointed!   It's not as 'fast' as fast food for obvious reasons (freshness & preparation) & it's worth the few extra minutes.",

The SHRDD Salad (lots of quinoa, chicken, eggs, and veggies) and Skinny Bitch Bowl (with salmon, quinoa, veggies, and a cilantro sauce, a little basic) are some go-to items for me, often purchased in advance for weekday lunches and very filling. One of these days I'll try their protein pancakes.  I do appreciate that they have a ton of condiments (hot sauces, liquid aminos, etc) to dial up the spice or flavor in your dish.",

You can never go wrong with the Sexy Bitch Bowl (snark snark), sans the red onions (because I dislike everything onion except for green) and 'shrooms (just because). It had the perfect blend of quinoa (noms), broccoli (yum), avocado (AVOOOO!!!), asparagus (bye bye water weight) and squash (I barely ever eat this stuff) - my only wish is that they have tomatoes or lime for me to squeeze onto. The salmon was soft in texture but not so buttery as I would like it to be. Needless to say I was filled and my burning insides were heartily satisfied. This would be my go-to, that's to say if I come here often after working out.   I asked for a citrusy juice and they recommended the Summer - it was indeed citrusy however nothing extraordinary as any other blended healthy drink.

The shakes are perfect size, taste, and enough to satisfy your hunger. Not too sweet either. Bison burger is the best. Awakens your taste buds! Not just a bland or fatty burger. ProteinHouse is definitely in the forefront of what most places should take after- healthy, good, quality food with flavor and made fresh on the spot.

This is the first place we've found so far in Vegas that serves bison meat.    They have great cooks here, because a little seasoning goes a long way.  They do a good job keeping the food clean, not too much oil, not too much of anything that allows the natural ingredients to take on it's flavor.  If you're looking to add more flavor, they have probably 10 different types of hot sauces, sweet sauces that you can add on yourself.  For example, they have an omelette made with 6 egg whites, a little bit of ham, folded over, topped with a few spoonful of cottage cheese and voila, protein packed meal.  They serve this meal with a variety of freshly cut fruits like melon, pineapple to end on a sweet note.    The average price is around $11 for a meal, but check them out on Groupon for better deals.  Download their app, so you can rack up free meals or smoothies with the online frequent card.  The current promotion with Yelp check-in for 10% off your order.    We recently discovered the protein pancakes topped with their protein frozen yogurt and it was definitely a fun dessert.  I can't see how this was even good for me, but it wasn't overly sweet and I didn't feel disgusted, so it was just right up my alley.  Totally hits the spot to satisfy that sweet craving.  We like to take out of town guests for a healthy meal because we really like it here.    One last thing.... Don't be intimidated by the jack-up looking dudes that eat here too, because everyone is friendly here.   Check out my delicious pictures. Yum!",

Area is clean & desserts are bomb. Try it out, you won't regret it :))))))))))",

The next morning drove from the strip back to PH, I  had the PB & J Protein pancakes. Umm still craving them today! My mom ordered the loaded oatmeal which she loved! Then our last day in Vegas we drove back to eat there one last time. I had the Froyo pancakes and my mom had the veggie omelet. If you have a chance to eat at any of their locations do it! You wont be sorry! Im so sad where I live we don't have one near us at all! Amazing food, even better prices, quality products !",

Anyhow, this place is definitely for your protein fix.  You can even find some drink specials on Groupon.  We didn't come for the drinks, we wanted to try the food that was available.  I had the Sexy Bitch which was Salmon sitting on top of quinoa and veggies.  I thought it was rather delicious and portioned to my liking.  I wouldn't say it wowed me, but it was healthy protein eats.  We weren't sure to leave our dishes on the table, but we did bring it up towards the counter.  So that was a bit confusing.    I like that the menu is detailed and lets you know what ingredients are in it, consumers should feel happy about that!  This is def a place for my hubs now that he trying to bring sexy back (after putting on some sympathy pregnancy weight) and I wouldn't mind tagging along with him.",

Portions are BIG, menu is varied and full of options and the customer service is good - the gals and guys at the counter are always pleasant. :)  Smoothies are to die for delicious. Vanilla Gorilla & Peanut Butter Dream are my picks. Also try the peanut butter protein cupcakes. They're DELISH and good to take on the go.   The fact that you can build your own bowl, burger or salad is dope, too. And you can choose your protein size portions! The ahi rocks and the pancakes are a must try when you feel like breakfast.  Protein House is casual, tasty and reasonably priced. Plus you never know who you're gonna see in there - athletes, fitness enthusiasts and healthy eaters from all over flock there for the food....and a hopeful glimpse or meeting with IFBB Figure Champ and badass owner of PH, Larissa Reis. She's the boss lady and happy to snap a picture with ya in front of their branded wall. Great spot - Awesome Food - Good Peeps",

For a 24 oz size it was almost $8, which is high for what I got: fruit, yogurt, and ice. In fact, the smoothie is quite bland, not much fruit taste. It mostly tastes like ice and yogurt. I could make about as good (or better) at home.   Their effort was definitely more for the weight-lifting and fitness crowd. Most of the food menu was \"jacked with protein.\" It took a long time to get service because you order at the counter and everyone in front of me was customizing their orders. I literally had time to go to the bathroom and get back in line without it moving. (Also, there was a mirror above the toilet in the women's bathroom???) They really need to move to an order from tables method if customization is such a big thing.   The menu did have some unique items like bison, quinoa, and acai. Can't say if the food was good. My smoothie is subpar and the wait in line was way too long.",

She was rude, did not know how to answer any questions about the menu, and when taking the order wasn't asking important things like what do u want on your sandwich!  The restaurant was messy, dirty tables, things not stocked, ect. My favorite pRt was when we asked for lemon for iced tea, and she walked away from the cash register, picks up lemon wedges with her bare UNWASHED hand and just hands them to me. Really??   A young girl came in for the night shift, immediately started bussing tables, and cleaning up while the other cashier leaned against the counter and watched her! It was ridiculous!

We sat here for 30 mins and with no other customers and no one thought 1) what are they waiting for? 2) who does this to go order belong to?  Food was pretty bad too. Go to Greens & Protiens for good food, good service.",

Just a simple review from a loyal customer hopefully they see this and address what am sure not the only one with the same thoughts.  John.",

    "text": "I was REALLY excited to try this place since I follow them on Instagram and actually it was the first thing I did as soon as I landed in Vegas.  We got there Saturday morning and it was empty. We looked at the menu for about 5 minutes and there were a couple of girls at the registrar that didn't bother to ask if we had any questions despite our confused looks. I decided to play it safe with the breakfast burrito and some much needed coffee after a 5am flight. They use illy coffee which is one of my favorite coffees and one of the best coffees out there. The cookies and cream coffee with almond milk was amazing.  Something interesting that happened was that once I placed my order I received a number, however no one delivered my food. I had the cook loudly yelling my number several times like if I was in a meat market. Who by the way was not friendly at all and looked like he hated his life the whole time.  The breakfast burrito was bland and had to soak it in Cholula sauce to make it taste better. Along with my burrito on the side there were some pieces of fruit (pinneaple, melon, and something else) the fruit looked and tasted old, you could tell that it was cut at least 1 or 2 days ago.  Before leaving I TRIED buying one of their tank tops however it's a mess and they are all scattered in no order next to the registrar. After looking for about 6 minutes and seeing that the girl at the registrar was not going to offer any help I asked her if they had some more in the back with my specific size. She replied with \"that's all we have\" and then I asked when were they receiving more since I was going to be in Vegas for the weekend and was willing to drive back to the restaurant to get the shirt. She replied with \"I don't know when we are getting more, maybe next month or 2 months.\" I decided to not buy anything and left the restaurant.  To say the least I was disappointed with my experience, however I will give them another chance and check them out next time I'm in Vegas, hopefully their customer service and food gets better.",

    "text": "All talk no walk.  After this places was hyped up to me and my bodybuilder by another close gym buddy, we came here to eat after the Olympia Expo.  The concept for this place is great and I fully understand the clientele they are marketing to.  So here is the break down:  The lack of communication between back and front of house is out of this world.  You're out of product and you don't let anyone know?   In fact you let customers order and only inform them once they send food back.  If you ask for anything to be different on your entree, you will not receive it, or you will receive what they want you to have.    Attention to tickets and menu items was a miss for our group as well.  Main ingredients missing for 2 of our 4 entrees, extras not received upon delivery of our food.  Customer service was strange as well.  The Co-owner was friendly when he took our orders and was happy to add additional items to my bowl and other adjustments to 2 other orders. I saw the other owner Jill running around and doing an excellent job. The two of them get an A+.  However the thick girl with the hipster glasses doesn't have a clue what she is doing other than bringing food to a table.  When confronted about the incorrect orders the response was \"um...so....um ok well I guess, what do you need?  let me see if we can do that\"  this alone blew my mind.  I work in the hospitality industry and server when I have to, this is never a response you should give a customer.  Maybe more training is needed with line staff and servers.....it can only help.  The food was ok otherwise.  I'm not use to food that is so under seasoned.  A little cumin or pepper never hurt anyone.  I get the salt and holding water aspect so salt isn't a big deal.  I would like to give this place another try though.  Everyone has an off night.  - Cara",

Before I go on with my review, I will say my other two friends who ordered different dishes enjoyed their food. My other friend and I ordered salads (low carb day, ugh) with the seared ahi on top. I got a side of the sweet potato sticks. The seared ahi was so not fresh, it was kinda gross. I was a little nervous to eat it but I was starving so ate it anyway. It looked like frozen ahi that was thawed and it tasted really fishy. I was not a fan. The sweet potatoes were so undercooked, they may as well have just served them to me raw. I'm not sure if I'll come here again, if I do I definitely will not be ordering the seared ahi salad again. Great idea for a restaurant though.   P.s. Why does the ice machine have a bunch of grime around the mouth of the dispenser? That was also a nono.",

    "text": "We are long time customers here. And we come here often and spend a lot of money. But it seems to be going downhill.  We had to stop for a last minute meal prep because we were working late.  We placed a $94.00 order, which included two wraps with gluten-free wraps.  When we got home we got wheat tortillas.  We were super bummed out because this is our favorite thing to get here.   We returned the following night because we are in the production industry working a show and had a 14 hour day.  Again we ordered a gluten-free wrap and sat down. The cashier came over after we had already paid and informed us they were out.  I mentioned the experience the night before and she said it's because they were out.  She didn't even acknowledge that our order was wrong or address it at all. And if we were allergic to gluten it would be a HUGE deal but we aren't we just love them. It might be a wise choice to let people know instead of just using whatever is available.   When my husband's wrap finally came out he said it looked weird. Not the usual. He couldn't even eat it and returned it and got a refund. It was thrown together with who knows what, clearly because the staff wanted to go home for the night. And we walked out completely dissatisfied.   I am really sad that our favorite place has turned into such a disappointment.  We might have to try Proteins and Greens from now on.",

When we got home we noticed there was not any avocado on any of the salads???  Really???  3 Salads and all 3 were. It made with all the ingredients as stated on the menu?  Why is it so hard to pay attention to detail and prepare foods the way it's stated on the menu?    I don't come here often, my daughter and son in law do and when you pay $14 for a salad, you should be given everything the menu says and what you are expecting.  The salad was good but it was very disappointing there was no avocado on the salad.  I guess now we can't trust that we are getting what we ordered and we need to inspect our food before we leave the place.  We should not have to, management should be making sure all food coming out is prepared properly.  I may give them another shot but it's iffy as this was a huge let down.",

Texture, color, flavor and smell are completely opposite. When they changed the product and didn't tell me, I knew something was off on my first bite. I have a very sensitive palette and can sense even a tiny change. The impossible meat smelled and tasted like wheat, dry consistency and breaks apart easily. I used to order this 3x's a week and now I don't even want to order it anymore. Please bring back BEYOND meat!! Thank you.",

I was a personal trainer for 10 years, over 30,000 sessions under my belt!  So I finally gave in and drug my butt in there after my morning workout for some breakfast!  YUM! YUM! YUM!  I was very impressed with the interior, great setting and ambiance to sit down and eat, the staff was very professional and I had a chance to speak to the owner/manager!  Awesome Team and the drinks and food was prepared great and food came out quickly!  I had a awesome veggie drink \"so good for me\" and I had a egg white omelet with some fruit!  It was so good, good for me and gave my body the replenishment of protein and carbs needed after a strong intense workout!  I definitely recommend this place to all who have fitness as a lifestyle or just want to eat healthier!  Great place to stop and get a protein shake After that intense workout! Yum - So Good For You!  A MUST GO FOR ALL!",

I arrived, waited in line for at least 12 min (2 people in front of me) and by the time I got to the front of the line, I was asked to wait at least another 5 min. Well, it's now been another who knows how long!! There are 3 people working. One the the front area and two who look like the cooks in the back area. In my opinion, it's not worth the wait. Everyone in here right now is extremely pissed! the cooks are giggling at the girl that they forgot to make her order. She had a pick up time of 7pm. She walked out at 7:44pm!! Well, I'm finally leaving at  7:53pm. AVery disorganized, lack of communication and lack of customer service!!! The girl at the front is not the nicest at all, doesn't greet you, doesn't even make eye contact or smile at you. I was just asked by one of the cooks what I was waiting for at 7:50pm!  Ow he is making my bowl and not too sure of what he's doing. Hey, at least he's trying.",

Pros: - Macro counts for each menu item clearly posted on the menu. -A good amount of options and choices. -my friend's smoothy was good -my bison burger was cooked to order  Cons: -Staff had little customer service skills and no energy not sure why since the place was empty -The food was okay. I ordered the Bison burger and it was just okay. The bun completely collapsed and had to eat it with a fork and knife. NOT WORTH 17 BUCKS -the sweet potato fries were burnt on the edges. -few sugar free drink choices other than water and stevia drinks. ( And FYI plenty of bodybuilders drink diet coke and sugar free beverages and I'm allergic to stevia) -the chocolate protein brownie was hard as a rock and tasted like a salt lick. I tossed it in the trash.  -VERY PRICEY",

I was expecting something different when I walked in, but was pleasantly surprised to see clean white lines and sleek look of the room.   The menu sort resembles an Instagram meal plan page and a weight trainer's cookbook, just the basic needs. Which does makes sense because the owner is an IG famous fitness trainer and can most likely kick your ass; as one her hobbies is UFC training. I went with the Thai Monster Bowl; chicken, lean top sirloin, broccoli, asparagus, green onions and a Thai peanut sauce on top. This was delicious and flavor packed, all the veggies were steamed and the protein grilled, there was literally no oils on anything and just lightly seasoned.   This bowl was a lot deeper than it looked and filled me for a good chunk of the day without feeling like I was stuffed and bloated. Seriously, this place is surprisingly good and definitely worth checking out. They also offer a decent assortment of protein shakes and espresso. yeah, espresso. Cray.   Pump up that meal plan brosef!",

Walking in feel pretty welcoming with lots of things to look at. We ordered the bison burger without bread and was pleased with how it tasted. This is not gonna be a gourmet burger but when trying to eat healthy it really did hit the spot.  The item on their menu we liked most was the real fruit smoothies. It didnt seem like it had any added sugars or even those fake sugars like turbinado or aspartame.  Really liked the fact that you cant even choose to drink a soda because they don't have any.  Pricing will seem a bit high but I think its mostly spot on with how expensive organics and grass fed beef stuff is.  Owner seems really nice.  I have one complaint and its really a small one. When we were there they were running one of those little vacuums that is only a little noisy. I don't know if the owner is OCD but a vacuum while eating is just an itty bitty complaint. The place is really spotless.  All in all I really like t his place for giving me a choice to go to for when I'm trying to eat clean. There really isn't a lot of places like that in Vegas. I am going to go back as I find that its worth it.",

Meat was cooked well had a great taste and the salmon was a very generous portion and cooked perfectly soft and perfectly cooked not over done at all.. Fresh wheat buns and yummy slices of avocado! I was impressed. Food was tasty yet very healthy. Perfect portion sizes. Also Ordered a green monster vegetable and fruit juice blend. I really liked it because it wasn't overly sweet. Overall great great experience and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to experience this new place.  I am pretty open when it comes to my food even with watching calories.    I ordered the PH Pancakes and my hubby ordered the Bison Burger wrapped in lettuce.  The pancakes were a nice multigrain, whey protein and it seems like a touch of cinnamon.  I have to say they were awesome.  My six egg whites were delivered on the side and were good as well.  I mean, you can't mess up egg whites.  My hubby was disappointed in the Bison burger as he felt it was rather bland, nor real seasoning at all.    Now, the reason I gave them 3 stars was all about the service. Service here is horrible.  We ordered our food and it took 45 mins for it to all be completed.  There were two other couples that ordered ahead of us and were already seated when we walked in the door to order.  Several other groups of people were served before we were including the two couples already seated.  I went up to ask if our order was misplaced.  My hubbies burger had been sitting on the counter for 10 mins and they didn't call us as they were still making my order of pancakes.   One of the other couples there said they had the same problem.   Now the place itself is a great industrial design.  But they have the music blaring so loud that  you literally have to be sitting next to the kitchen to hear when your name is called for your food.   If you are into healthy food, I have to agree they are good but if you can, call ahead for pick up because the wait is just not fun. And be prepared to pay a little higher for your food than other places.",

Serving sizes are generous, unlike many health oriented restaurants, and mine (teriyaki bowl with salmon) was perfectly prepared.  Salmon was moist and the vegetables still had some crunch. I would recommend it highly.   Oh the service.  Yes they do seem a bit disconnected, but not a big deal IMHO.     I hope they make it.  The world needs more dining options like this one.",

During a recent getaway myself and my girlfriend enjoyed an array of items on their menu.  Muscle boy breakfast = straight and forward everything was cooked my liking and delicious  thai monster w/ brown rice = delicious and highly curious on to whats in their peanut sauce marinade  steak breakfast burrito = best thing ever (keep in mind ive been on a chicken rice diet for the past few weeks so red meat was like crack at this moment) it was like the perfect helping of red meat and egg whites.   gf had the salmon salad at that too was crazy flavorful and delicious.  we also tried a peanut butter protein smoothie = OH GOD (bigseanvoice) i seriously need to figure out how to make that thing.  While we were waiting the manager noticed our anxiousness and decided to have us try out some samples of a new smoothie they were working on. Its little aspects like this that really give an impression on the type of business theyre running. Even the busboys were nice to even see how our experience was when he picked up our plates.   my only want would be a macro count on their menu cause im very curious to see the calorie count/macro ratios on some of their items.",

Great variety of interesting, delicious sounding healthy things on the menu so deciding was a challenge.  I opted for the Vegan wrap and man was it good.  Super fresh ingredients, lots of flavor and holy cow am I full.  Great place for you to eat whether a mean eater or a vegetarian.  5 of us ordered a variety of things and were so pleased we had to stop for breakfast again on our way out of town.

I met the owner,  Larissa Reis, when I ate there and she is very down to earth and personable.  The staff seemed friendly. There's an array of condiments from sugar free ketchup to Sriracha, which again is fantastic for those with specific diets. The portion sizes are perfect,  leaving you satisfied. I wasn't too fond of the peanut butter smoothie which seemed too watery for my taste  but I'm used to tropical smoothie and Jumba Juice,  which really isn't fair for me to compare. The only con is I wish there was a Protein House on the north side of town...perhaps near the new LVAC ;)",

I ordered the Aloha Signature burger which comes with grilled chicken, pineapple, red onion and teriyaki sauce. When I received the burger I thought it looked a little... Plain. I noticed they had forgotten the pineapple. So I took the burger back to the counter and asked for pineapple. The cook didn't seem to speak English and did not understand me so the cashier was explaining they didn't have the regular pineapple slice.???? But they could cut some up and put it on in chunks. They seemed almost put out by my request. They put the pineapple on in chunks with a really shitty presentation so as soon as I tried to pick it up the burger contents fell all over wooden plank plate.   The fact that they tried to short me the main ingredient on my burger then implied to me that they were put out by adding it and then was a terrible presentation makes me not want to return again.   Very poor customer service and rapport with a local who knows a lot of locals.",

We both had the Steak Burrito and it was delicious!!!!!  I would most definitely recommend this place to ANYONE, not just the health nuts.  Yes the decor caters to bodybuilding and fitness buuuuuut after all it is a healthy place to eat and the amount of time and effort that is put into those competitions, I would have my photos on the wall as well!  To all the negative reviews on here due to decor and or uncomfortable due to photos on the wall, save it.....I am probably the most unhealthy person that has walked through those doors and I loved the vibe and motivation this place offers!  Keep up the good work Proteinhouse, I would also like to get some franchise opportunity info if you happen to read this review.",

It is located in the plaza off of Eastern and Richmar near Grimaldis.The restaurants is spacious with a modern flair to it. It had abundant seating between the sleek tables and comfy couches. The menu had standards items, or you could build your own masterpiece of healthy deliciousness. They serve breakfast, burgers, salads, bowls, juices and smoothies. I opted for the Greek Bowl: ground up turkey burger, roasted tomato, black olives, feta cheese, cucumber, and red onion. These items come on top of your choice of either brown rice or quinoa; I went with quinoa. I tossed some sriracha in there, because I am an addict and I admit it. It tasted phenomenal and the portion size was enough for two meals. The price was a bit steep - $9.99 plus tax for the bowl. The Yelp check in was 10% off, but I am not sure if they still have that promotion. It is definitely a great option for when you are trying to eat well, but not skimp on the flavor. The staff was friendly and patient. I am excited to try more of their menu.",

I called and spoke to the cashier and she was not even helpful in resolving the issue or suggesting another way to get their food to me.   When an employee doesn't show passion for what they do it is a deterrent to want to continue to deal with them.  I am that person when I have a problem I don't even take the time to comment or explain I will simply move on and find another satisfier for my cravings.  I just happen to really like this restaurant and I will go back but as far as ordering...naw I'm good on that.  you won't get that money anymore, but I will occasionally go into the store in the future.",

The food took half an hour to come out (our friend had her meal in 10 minutes) and we had to send part of it back because they neglected a food allergy.  Told the manager, and she just told us to come back tomorrow and they'll be better.  (Not after that) Very expensive disappointment, and super unimpressed with the manager who didn't even offer up an apology.",

And that's to be expected especially when a restaurant has 10-20 lazy people that didn't want to cook come and eat good protein food. The guy in front of me threw a baby tantrum! A full grown man!!! Lol Wow dude, you were such a show.. if you didn't want to wait  15-20 min to eat you should've cooked yourself. Anyways my favorite is the Southwest bowl with Quinoa rice.. I highly recommend this plate, but if you're not a fan of healthy don't get Quinoa get something that's fits you, the best part of this restaurant is the options, Customize your food girl/ boy I'm definitely not scared to try anything on the menu.. ( do it, do it) food should be good and simple and they have simply perfected that. Try the sample drinks too!",

    "text": "I've given Protein House a handful of chances, but each time I'm left very underwhelmed. They are consistently very slow. The cashier has little to no personality, and usually makes me feel like I'm burdening them in having them do their job. And perhaps this is just me, but I figure a restaurant that is solely focused on being health conscious would be more accommodating to special requests.  I grabbed an early dinner here and walked in already knowing full-on what I wanted. I ordered a PH Chopped salad with the dressing and cheese on the side, to-go. I had to repeat exactly what I wanted 3 times as the cashier was disinterested, hardly looked up at me, and couldn't crack a smile if her life depended on it. Eventually she repeated back to me exactly what I wanted, asked me what temperature for the steak (I ordered medium-rare), and then offered me a cup for water while I wait which was a nice touch.  20 something minutes later, they are finally calling my name with my to-go order, which they shouted 3 times as apparently I am not fast enough moving from the table to their counter as they would've liked. Hey, I waited 20 minutes for this bad-boy, give me and my sore legs a chance to react, would ya?  While walking out, I did a quick check in the bag, noticed the dressing nicely packed on its own, and no utensils. Scanning the front for any plasticware, I saw none. I figured I could hold off until I'm at a friend's before eating, so I didn't sweat it.   Finally getting down to eat my meal, I took one bite and realized they hadn't packaged the cheese on the side at all. It was crumbled and viciously mixed in with the rest of the salad. Now to be honest with you, I probably should have told them to hold off on the cheese altogether. It's not that I don't like blue cheese (I love it), but it's just not on the menu for me right now. You'd think a restaurant catered to dieters would be more careful...  The steak was cooked to medium, which was actually a pleasant surprise as last time I ordered medium-rare they decided to obliterate the crap out of it until it was a nice, grey, chewy mess. But maybe next time if they don't overcook it, I won't have to wait 25 minutes for a salad. I could have gone to Cafe Zupas and gotten the same salad, done correctly, and for a fraction of the cost. Sad for a health conscious restaurant. I would not recommend. Greens & Proteins is the only way to go in the area.",

The tuna was seared wonderfully and the flavors in that salad were awesome. I took out the celery and had cucumber because I'm not a fan of celery. The portion was large and I'm actually very glad about that because it lasted me all night at work (10 hour shift and the hospital's cafeteria wasn't open during my shift). It was filling enough for me to eat a little bit and come back to it. The produce was very fresh and the tuna was fresh and seasoned very nicely. I had the balsamic vinaigrette dressing and it went with the salad nicely. Next time I'll have to try the dressing it comes with but it wasn't an option with the online ordering.   It's definitely not hard to find the place when you park. It's very clear with the nice big sign outside. I haven't dined indoors yet but it seemed inviting. I like the little impulse-buy sections they have with protein bars, drinks, etc. I'm excited to try more of what's on their menu. Next time I'm on that side of town I'll be trying out something different. It seems like it only gets better each time for most patrons! :)",

But no joke this place doesn't lack luster in any of the food items on the menu! Seasoning is all there to tantilize your tastebuds! Now im a Paleo, zone, eat right freak who cheats once a week to feel like I don't send my mind to the imaginary food gauntonimo bay!   But the food is amazing. I had a general bowl and a monster green juice. It was so well balanced and filling! My bison was cooked perfect! I even had to fulfil my sweet tooth and pick up some homemade protein balls! Needless to say I ate those before you could ask to taste one!  I do croasfit, I'm crazy, but I'm Italian and I cater so I know food food! This is GOOD HEALTHY LIVING FOOD FOR AN AMAZING PRICE!

I should have known from my 25-minute observation while waiting for our 2-item order that I should not have stepped foot out of this place without checking my order. So, here I am stuck with a lunch I won't eat. I ordered ahi, cooked all the way through... No pink, I explicitly stated. Ahi I got was as pink as can be. I ordered brown rice. No rice to be found. I tried calling the restaurant just to let them know and it goes straight to voice mail.

While this place is a great idea and has unimaginable potential, they are not quite there yet with her food preparation. I had the teriyaki bowl to start. The menu offers rice and quinoa, but I was left without the option when she took my order. I settled for rice, which is not my favorite, and was quickly disappointed by it being undercooked. After giving them the benefit of the doubt and not yet having my hunger satisfied, we ordered the bison burger that the rest of the reviews suggested. It is a big mean burger, that is for sure, but again we were disappointed with the food preparation. She gave us the option of how we wanted the meat cooked and we requested it be cooked \"medium.\" Unfortunately, the meat was cooked very well done. Like I said before, the restaurant and its food has so much potential, but the way it is prepared influences and is impressionable on its customers most. If customers are going to be given the option I'm have something will be cooked, then that is how it should be cooked. I was under the impression that the folks who are running the grill we're under experience, and therefore we would be willing to give this place a second chance.",

However, the only bad thing I can say about the place is how my order always seems to get messed up in one way or another every time I order here. Whether it be something added that I didn't want or something that I did want that's not put on the plate, it happens every time! I also don't like how they do not keep the restaurant clean at all times. Whenever I'm there, there's crumbs on the floor or tables not cleaned up after, which I guess the white tile, walls, and furniture don't help to hide but still, ewww. There's always at least five to six people working so I would think they would keep it clean at all times. Other than that the atmosphere is really chic, plus it makes me feel expensive and healthy all at the same time. I would recommend that if you were to order a breakfast item, to get the Protein Pancake Combo! I'm addicted, it is so good and so is every other item on the menu.",

Came here on my fourth day in Vegas and the food was fantastic! Also ordered a strawberry banana protein shake to go along with the chicken salad I ordered. My mom enjoyed here chicken salad as well as my grandmother who enjoyed her burger. Will most defiantly make a trip here again when I visit Vegas next year. The restaurant was clean, quiet, wasnt to busy the time we came, and our food was made quick. Wish we had a place like this back home. Overall I had an amazing experience with Protein House.",

The low rating was because of a noxious cigar smoke smell that led me to go back home and wash my hair and clothes. Someone was smoking a cigar just outside the entrance.  Every time the door opened (which was frequently; it's a busy place) the smell permeated the entire place (and we were sitting at a table nearly the farthest away from the door).  The staff (much closer to the door than us) had to have smelled it, and did nothing.  Finally, we gave up waiting for them to take some action, and spoke to the manager.  The manager did go out and apparently speak with the smoker -- but nothing changed! The smoker continued to smoke and the staff did not seem to do anything else. Disappointed to say this, but we will think twice before going back.",

As far as food you can't mis, everything they have is healthy. I usually go with the PH Chopped Cobb or a Teriyaki Bowl. Prices are a little high but its worth it for the quality of food. There are many things on the menu that I would like to try so I will definitely be making a trip back soon.",

The food here is very delicious, freshly made with fine ingredients. there is a ton of things to choose from, they even have breakfast & healthy deserts they sell. Portions are pretty good here, i usually cant finish my bowls, they are filling. Greek bowl & south western bowl... YUMM. The brownies here are amazeballs!! can NOT believe that they are healthy. The reason im giving this place only 3 stars is because of my experiences here, the staff isn't as nice or lively as i like, its like they are too cool to smile or something especially the guys! I will also say a few of my clients that are a over weight have told me they feel a bit discriminated coming here/ unwelcome because of their size. But i dont really think this place is inviting either and im pretty fit. Also this place is on the pricey side. Might as well go eat at an actual restaurant where people serve you the food and refill your drinks, just saying. I am not hating on this place tho i will definitely be back because the food is to my liking.",

Walked in and it smelled like a sweaty gym locker, not sure if that was intentional from the slogan \"eat clean train mean get lean.\" Menu was on the pricey side, but I consider worth it for its healthy alternative nature. Had the PH burger and a PBJ protein smoothie. Both excellent, the burger comes a little bland at first but there are a multitude of condiments to tailor your food your liking, or as I saw it, level of healthiness. I added just katchup, and some salt to the sweet potato slices that came with it. The lettuce was chopped into tiny chunks which kept falling out, I would have preferred larger leaves to stay together better. Overall I'd come back, not sure how old the place is but it could use a little tweaking including decoration which was a little sterile. It seemed endorsed by one athlete named Larissa Reis whom I've never heard of but her picture was everywhere. She looks fantastic, if that helps the place any. Get some air fresheners.",

Surprisingly, they don't have a lot of vegetarian options so I ordered the berry acai bowl which was listed for $7.99 and recommended to me by a friendly female staff member. A friendly male staff member rang me up and told me it would be $10.00. I told him it's listed on the menu for $7.99. He said \"oh, that's for the smoothies, the bowls cost more\" Well, that would be ok if it were actually listed anywhere on the menu, but it clearly states \"smoothies and acai bowls $7.99\" I thought maybe it was just a mistake on the menu so I looked above where they have the entire menu written on chalk boards. Once again, clearly listed \"smoothies and acai bowls $7.99\" I then asked the female employee if the price listed was wrong. She said \"yes, the bowls are more because there's more toppings\" I said \"then you really should change the prices on the menus\" she said \"I know, I told him (the owner, manager??) that\". The whole thing just seemed wrong to me. On top of that, it wasn't even that good, I've had much better acai bowls for less money and considering they were in Orange County where things are usually more expensive, that's saying a lot.",

I feel bad for people who are out of shape that have to be surrounded by posters of fitness models.  CONs: First, the Feng Shui is off. If you are facing the bar, you would expect to order on the right and pick up on the left. It's the opposite here. Awkward place to stand while you order, claustrophobic space. During lunch I watched every single person who ordered get confused by this.  Customer service was terrible and I did not tip. The female cashier was very meek, lacked desire for life and had zero enthusiasm.   Men's restroom is full of cleaning/maintenance equipment(ladder) that overflows into the restroom stall. Lastly, I was given a number to place on my table as if a waiter would be bringing me my order. Instead, I was beckoned by a chef to pick up my order at the counter. If I am dinning in and you give me a number to place on my table, you should put those double doors to good use and bring out the $12 salad to my table.  PROs: Himalayan Salt and  cracked pepper at table. Berry Salad was a 4 out of 5. Lettuce tasted a little dirty.",

They used a nut based seasoning on her \"Mediterranean  Wrap\"! She had an instant reaction when we got home and she took a bite. We rushed to the hospital and luckily we live close by.  If you're serving food shouldn't you need to know what ingredients you are serving. I'm absolutely infuriated with this type of service. You are playing with people's lives. Your employees should listen to their customers instead of assuming. A business like yours show list that you use nuts or any other commonly known ingredients that may cause allergic reactions...  Your employees need to be trained on how incorporate safety for its customers. We are not just $$ money coming into your doors!",

    "text": "A new restaurant in the valley named Protein House.  With a name like that, of course I need to see what's really going on.  Located off Eastern Avenue near LVAC and Gold's Gym, Protein House is another restaurant that offers healthy eats with a ton of protein. But to me, PH is not just another healthy meal stop. PH offers smoothies, breakfast, burgers, bowls, and salads. To order, you can either go straight to the counter and place your order off their menu. Or, you can take their order checklist, select your meal, and then hand it to the counter.  You also have the option to build your own burger, salad, and bowl.  Because this was my first visit, I decided on their biggest and baddest burger, their Muscle Builder Burger. This burger is 12 oz of ground Bison, onions, cheese, and Canadian bacon all served in a whole wheat bun. I had this medium well and swear that this is one of the best bison burgers I have ever had.  Most exotic meats like bison come gamey and with no taste. Here at PH, they found a way to create this burger with flavor.  By the way, trying to up your protein for the day? This burger has to be close to 70 grams of protein.  Yeah buddy!  As for the restaurant itself, I felt that it is a little small. But I love the ambiance, decor, and service. One things for sure, there's a ton of fit peeps eating here. I also got the opportunity to meet one of the owners, Andrew Bic. To be successful in any venture, it comes down to how you treat people. Andrew got this right. He took the time to chat it up, ask for suggestions, and gave a little insight of what PH is all about.  I didn't get the chance to meet the other owner, Larissa  Reis, but look forward to it on future visits.  If you're use to the taste that a 1000 calorie burger joint has to offer, then maybe Protein House is not for you.  If you're looking for some quality macros with high amounts of protein in a burger, then give Protein House a shot.    Wish List: -Ostrich:  With about the same amount of protein as steak and with calories/fat that rival chicken, I think ostrich should be on their menu. -Nutritional Information:  For a place that specializes in selling healthy meals, I think this information is necessary.  Per the owner, this is in the works with a dietitian.  PS: Like all other healthy eating locations (i.e Whole Foods, Greens & Protein, etc), expect a higher price tag here.  But through their build-your-own, you can actually get a meal fairly cheap.",

The location looked clean and lean so they did a great job keeping it in theme.  The staff was friendly. Loved that.  I ordered a veggie omelette and a peanut butter dream protein smoothie. Both items were packed with flavor. I probably should have just ordered the smoothie because I'm now stuffed.  My co worker ordered a bowl that was also delicious.   You can't go wrong coming here. Healthy , yummy and  clean ! I will come eat here at least once anytime I'm in Las Vegas.",

Since I follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons, I inquired about the Teriyaki sauce and it's soy sauce/gluten content. The staff was unavailable to give me an answer, so I decided to go with the Chicken Caesar wrap, with the gluten-free wrap.  Once I got the box to go, I check inside and it was a whole wheat wrap. I asked and they said they didn't have any gluten-free wraps available. They were going to knowingly let me walk out with something that I didn't ask for and that could actually hurt me. So, she asked if I'd like it in a bowl. I begrudgingly agreed.  I got the bag and walked out the door, just to find that they added croutons into the bowl. I was too frustrated to even go back in to get a refund. I'll eat the cost and the time.  The lack of communication, knowledge, and the level of carelessness made this an awful experience.",

Today I go in and ordered a smoothie, changed my mind and ordered a bowl instead and got a smoothie in a bowl. Not only did they add coco flakes but they also forgot the granola. The first time I got the bowl, the coco was sprinkled on. The second time, it was blended in. Coco makes my mouth itch so it was a little irritating that either the barista was too lazy to make a new bowl or that the counter girl didn't remember the 5 times I told her no coco extra bananas. It would be helpful if the cashier listened to their customers. Really unsatisfied with my visit this morning.",

Mind you I chewed a lil piece while I was eating, almost threw up the texture is weird to me which is why I didn't want it! I paid for extra sauce but didn't see it so I had to ask for it. I'm glad i checked my bag. The best part was when I was eating my macadamia cookie. This was my first time eating from this place so i was thinking wow this cookie is really chewy as i was trying to eat it. When i spit it out and i see a piece of rubber glove. The pieces of rubber glove was literally in the middle of the cookie. Thanks Protein House!",

At one point, they signed me up for a rewards program, but when I asked clarifying questions, they had no idea how it even worked. Baffling.   The last straw was on my visit today, I called to order a protein shake, and of course the girl was incredibly rude and miserable on the phone. I took my first few sips of my protein shake when I left, and felt what I thought was fruit skin or something of the sort. Nope. It was a produce sticker left over from whatever they blended in my drink. I'm including a photo for reference.  It's a shame. I like the food here (usually) but the blatantly rude customer service, lack of consistency, and then this... This place has got to go.",

Pretty addictive place, as even the pancakes are done in a manner that are so good, so want to experience their bowls. They are also great. The bowls with salmon, avocado and brown rice / quinoa are excellent. You certainly will see the hard core workout guys in this place. Can't say you are in the wrong place to try to eat healthy. Downside - it is not cheap. You really need to work around the menu to experience everything. Not as massive as greens and protein as far as a menu. The quality is really good and even when you think that there was not enough food - your body will tell you otherwise. It is filling. Frequent guest program needs work. Even if you don't work out or want to have a super clean diet plan - it is well worth trying.",

I had the bison cheese steak wrap, and it was filling, tasted good, and came with a side of fresh fruit instead of greasy fries/chips.   They also have a cooler full of energy drinks (including my current favorite - Bang) in addition to a protien shake bar and normal soft drinks.

Again, the foods good but there seems to be a lack of communication (or attentiveness) between the person who takes the order and the person who preps it.",

We had the Chocolate Monster Pancakes, Acai Coconut Bowl, kids teriyaki chicken bowl and the steak burrito. Along with various coffees that were amazing (Snickers, Mocha Loco, caramel macchiato). Also, love how the drinks have BCAAs.  All in all, I am sooo glad there's a place where one can eat out and healthy. Thank you Protein House!",

Would have liked the more traditional homemade taste.  Still, I will return especially for the fresh fruit and fresh veggie smoothies especially. Staff is friendly.",

So if you want to go there so you can take some selfie's and tell people via social media you're there, so you can get some likes. That's definitely the place to go for that. Me no thanks won't pay extra for below avg food just to say I'm there. For $25 I can go to Echo & Rig and get a nice skirt steak.",

    "text": "How could you pass by a place with a name like Protein House and not stop in? This place is a bodybuilding fuel mecca. For those looking to eat clean with macros, portion sizes, or protein intake in mind this place can cater to your needs.  Upon visiting I elected to go for the $14.99 Muscle Builder burger cooked medium rare. Two bison burger patties topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and a slice of Canadian bacon on a wheat bun with a side of sweet potato sticks. In one word, this thing was phenomenal! I've had bison before, but this was the best I'd ever had. It's crazy how something so good for your body could taste so good. Upon ingesting, I immediately felt the nutrients rush to all of my major muscle groups and felt them start to grow! Slight exaggeration there, I apologize.  When I had originally ordered my meal, the cashier turned her iPad screen around and it allowed me to input a pre-calculated tip. After I did so, she gave me my water cup and I filled it myself. When my food order was up, I had to get up and grab it myself. Not certain why a tip was necessary for that, but now at least I'll know for next time. Also, don't forget to check-in with the Yelp app and receive 10% off your entire order!",

I will continue this pattern as the foodis well prepared, healthy, fresh and filling!  The staff is wonderful and the on line advanced ordering system is easy to navigate!

I ordered chicken with greens and asked to add three fried eggs. She took my order and I sat down with a number waiting on my dish. They called out my number, which is weird considering that you are given a number on card holder so I thought someone was bringing me my order. Oh well, no biggie.  I went up to the window to pick up my plate and sat down. The food wasn't bad but it was a little bland. The eggs were over cooked. I like to have some yolk but it came with the yolk cooked all the way through. Could have been my fault since I didn't make it clear on my end. The food was okay, the person taking my order was friendly and the place was clean so I'd say it's a three star.",

They had all kinds of stuff like bowls, sandwiches and wraps. They are strive for healthy and organic food. I went for a bowl with cauliflower rice, veggies, and teriyaki chicken and it was super good. They also gave me a cup try to BCAA drinks I tried the watermelon that was really good. Definitely a place to go to after a workout. This place is awesome. I highly recommend coming here great place and great people!",

I asked for a \"To go\" bowl which was already dirty with food in there. Not sure how the staff missed that. What's also disturbing is how much money this place makes and they want to be cheap on the sauces and put water in them instead of buying new ones right away, I posted pictures. Gross! Just stick to the shakes and juices.",

    "text": "Even though I'm only giving this place three stars I plan to go back and I really hope to have a better experience. First off, let me just say they have a ton of vegetarian and vegan options! And not just basic options like tofu or veggie bowls, they have some really interesting food and all of it looked good- a main reason I'll be going back. When I received my food, however, it was cold. I think the food sat for a while before it was finally bought out because it took longer than it seems it should have considering the place wasn't busy in the slightest.   I ordered the PH Vegan Burger and it was good, just cold. I could tell there were flavors and spices but they were hard to detect at that temp. I do really love, love, love that this place has HEALTHY vegan/vegetarian food- no GMO's, organic, etc. This, along with the variety of food choices, is why I will be going back, hoping for a chance of redemption. I ate most of the food besides maybe a quarter of the burger and was pleasant satiated.   If you're health conscious, this is definitely a great place worth checking out. Their food and drinks options are aligned with a healthy lifestyle and it's conveniently located right down the street from LVAC. It's pretty pristine and modern inside, with outdoor seating as well. Crossing my fingers next time will be better! I really want to love this place.",

This place is seated in a nice plaza with other interesting restaurants that I'd like to try some time. Plenty of parking as well.  On the inside, I loved the vibe of this place. Very sleak, clean, everything had an almost white & greyish, kitchen metal tint to it, and on the walls were graphics for the menus and images of other high profile people who've eaten there.  In terms of food, I love their variety and options. I ordered one of their bowls, and was really glad that they are willing to customize your order based on what you like. One bump down would just be the pricepoint. Depending on what you order, this place would not be your spot for a typical lunch.  But still very good! Would definitely come here again.",

Right in the main restaurant area on Eastern, it is very easy to find but has limited parking spots due to the extremely populated area.  It is super clean inside and gives healthy options. If you do not work out, have an active lifestyle, or need the extra protein, the smoothies may not be the best choice. The smoothies have a strong protein powder taste to it, but as I have an active lifestyle I do enjoy it!  The food is cooked right on spot and you can even see the chefs working on the food. I have only gotten salads here and all of them are amazing! I recommend 10/10. Especially when needing an extra health kick, this is a great place!",

In this instance, the yolked Brazilian owner was getting screwed by her staff and gets busted.  I saw that the scene took place here in Las Vegas, but never thought to look the place up.  Anyhow, the place is a lot like Greens and Protiens, without the rush and with a more user friendly menu with much more enticing names,  if you ask me.  Sexy Bitch?!?  C'mon now...just imagine,  someone eating out a sexy...well you get the point.  The ultra-modern look also adorns the dining area,  similar to G&P, except this place uses tougher colors,  yeah!  It's like Cobra Commander eats here while Oscar the Grouch eats at G&P with Kermit the Frog.  I wouldn't even flinch if I heard someone slamming their plate to the table after 3 rep bites with an emphatic grunt....Arrrrggghhhhh!  The ginormous screen was also playing some NCAA games,  which was a plus.  Seems like they do everything big up in hur, I swear that TV needed Olympic doping tests #pacquiao...and so did my PH Burger.    Being in this place gave me the feeling to go big or go home, the no pain no gain mentality.  I inquired whether I should opt for the single patty, or go for the Muscle Builder Burger, 2 bison patties topped with bacon.  The girl at the register said the single should suit me just find, when in fact I can picture her saying, \"not with those puny arms,\" like in the State Farm commercial with Discount Double Check A Rod.  She was right tho...  The wifey ordered the Sexy Bitch without hesitation,  just cause she is.  The bowl was a healthy dose of lightly grilled veggies and quinoa topped with a nice slab of salmon.  I took a few bites and nodded in approval.   Overall, the Protein House was pretty good and a great option for meatheads, health nuts,  clean eaters and average Joe dodge ball...check it out for yourself and don't forget to check in for 10% off your entire meal.

The not so friendly cashier said they only offer one juice, the Green Monster.  I chose Green Monster and Earl chose the Berry Blast Smoothie.  The ingredients used to make green monster includes spinach, coconut water, honey dew, pineapple, lime, ginger, cucumber, and kale.  Tasted like kale and spinach juice though.  There was no hint of sweetness from the fruits.  Earl's berry blast smoothie, which we could only taste whey protein.  Overall, glad we tried it, so we know to get something different next time.  I like to try a place thrice before writing it off, therefore, Meh for now.",

It has a really nice appearance outside and is very spacious inside. I love the contemporary ambience that this place has. From the lights to the dining room layout to the chalkboard menus, this place has a nice interior which gives off a modern, relaxed vibe.   I love the whole concept that this place has. A healthy lifestyle is never out of style, and I enjoy their twist on it. The entrees make people realize that you don't have to eat a boring ole salad to eat healthy. Their menu consists of so many options that I can't wait until I go back to try more. They use healthier alternatives to certain foods such as egg whites, whey protein, quinoa, and stevia. I had the \"Sexy Bitch Bowl.\" I loved the combination of flavors that this bowl had, which I would've never thought to combined.   As for the service, it took someone a while to greet us and to let us know that they had a smaller more condensed menu. We were so overwhelmed by the chalkboards and kept having to walk back and forth around the counter, trying to look at everything. But the workers were very kind nonetheless.  Other than that, I highly recommend this unique place. Will definitely be back.",

For a place that is run by a bodybuilder I thought there would be nutritional information available for each dish. We ordered Larissa's Thai monster bowl and the signature teriyaki bowl.  Thai monster bowl- chicken was slightly raw; lacked seasoning; peanut butter lovers will like the spicy peanut sauce  Teriyaki bowl- teriyaki sauce? The teriyaki sauce here is orange in color and if I was blind folded I never would have guessed it was teriyaki sauce   I forgot to use the 10% check in deal so Larissa gave me a chocolate protein brownie instead. I wanted to try the chocolate brownie in the beginning but for $4 and the size I didn't see the value. The brownie ended up being the best thing I tasted here. It was very moist but I was hoping to know the nutrition facts.   I will be back if I'm in the area and in need of healthy food. However, I will not go out of my way because of the lack of nutrition information; high prices; sauces not tasting the way they are described.",

She seemed as though we were interrupting her by placing our order!!! I am sorry that my purchases are paying for you to have a job young lady... is how I felt!!!  There are advertisements that specifically state they use Illy coffee. So I proceeded to order one for my aunt who only drinks this particular brand. The staff member told me they were out. I stated ok, but you advertise you sell Illy coffee. She said, that she would have to make more and that it takes a while so I would have to wait (with a attitude mind you). I stated that was fine and I just wanted a cup of coffee. After much hesitation and a bit of attitude she made a cup. Upon arriving back at the hospital with our food and the coffee... The coffee was not Illy!!!! It was bitter and acidic, nothing like Illy brand. The bowl we ordered was so spicy it was almost too spicy to eat and I grew up with spicy. So I have no idea what they did to this bowl.  I won't be returning... I feel that overall the food is overpriced and the staff is extremely rude. I won't be going back and warn others to take precautions.",

    "text": "Talk about some hearty healthy food but with flair since my first impression walked in was is this ultra lounge for body builders or workout fanatics. Really not often you walk into health conscious restaurant see lounge area that can sit down got just about every fitness magazine laid out for reading pleasure (from muscle & fitness, just about every one can think of) but yet still have bar stools and tables relax have meal. One more thought with different. If ever lost in the world of fitness or IFBB need too know who current just walk into the bathrooms. Think kind of weird but too each his own.   Now what really matters the food. It was my first time so really had no idea direction too go. It decent size menu so had just about every healthy option can think of. I like  the way the menu is structured from bowls, salads, burgers, and drinks. Each list typical healthy options comes too if want switch around protein, carb, add, or build your own healthy creation. I stuck with standard since was my first time. I went with the Southwest Bowl and Berry Jubilee for my drink. The Southwest Bowl was AAAwesome! I went with whole wheat pasta for my carb choice between brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta. I loved the fact that it was HEARTY healthy bowl. I always associate healthy with bare minimum of portion. At Protein House not cheating you out of your protein/carb! The top sirloin was cooked too my exact temp and combine the avacado, roasted tomatoe, roasted red pepper, cheese, and black bean salsa. Nice light sauce neither oily, greasy, and just light/refreshing pasta bowl. I could eat healthy everyday. It between pricey and cheap so not sure if could eat Protein House style healthy everyday. But without doubt you get the most bang for your buck hands down compare too other health restaurants. Look forward too trying more of the menu.  The service was fabulous. One that make point not too go at the last second. Really wanted too try Protein House. 30 minutes is broader line. The whole staff never rushed us although my guilty conscious made me eat faster... Even when I apologize when we first walked in asked if ok they greeted us with smile and walked us through the menu for newbies.",

At this time, I watched as one of the employees climbed onto the food prep counter to grab a container of protein powder that was above her reach.

Would not have been that big of a deal...but she didn't disinfect the counter or even wipe it off before she started using the exact same surface to prepare a smoothie for the next customer.  She put fresh fruit and vegetables on the counter in the exact spot she was just standing.  She saw me watching her and didn't seem to think it was a big deal.

The cashier then told us our total and immediately sounded wrong but I didn't say anything initially, I paid her and she said our meal would be called by number when ready and was ready to ring up the next customer. I had to ask for my receipt and she seemed irritated. We got the receipt and and noticed a $4 charge. We were charged $2 extra per burger for the choice of Ezekiel bread. It's only $4 and we would have no problem paying BUT it does NOT state that there is an extra charge for different bread on the menu. It actually says \"with your choice of...\" Or something along those lines. AND the cashier did NOT mention that the bread is an additional cost. Again, the money part doesn't bother us but the lack of communication from the cashier AND that the menu is MISLEADING. This is just straight bad customer service and SHADY. We brought it to her attention and she acknowledged that it does not state the extra charge on the menu but it's on her computer so she had to charge us. Hopefully these cashiers will at least be courteous from not on and let paying customers know. She did offer our money back but we declined because that wasn't the point. Also, I ordered sweet potato \"sticks\" and they are NOT sticks. They're cubed sweet potatoes. Annoying. Not worth the $34! I'm all about paying extra for healthy food but when places are shady with pricing and customer service is crap that's where I draw the line. I think Daily Kitchen is WAY better and Greens n Proteins as well.  The burger was good but not good enough for me to ever come back. I hope the owner reads this and takes this into consideration. Ps, they also don't have free wifi which the other places do. That's an important factor to me as when I visit these places I tend to do some work which free wifi is a nice complimentary gift in my opinion.",

We have few and far places in Vegas for healty eating. Every item on the menu so far has been packed with flavor..Im in love with the bison burger and sweet potatoe fries. If your lucky the owner Larissa will there hanging out and for being a super fitness model is more than sweet and approachable. Keep up the good work Protein House!",

I have tried the breakfast burritos, bison burger, and the Greek bowl. All are awesome for the clean eaters.  Customer service is so-so, they all seem pretty quiet and reserved here.

Located conveniently across the street from the Gold's gym on Eastern near Serene and down the street from LVAC, this has been a good spot for us to eat post-workout.  Breakfasts, burgers, bowls, salads, juices, and smoothies are on the menu, with options to choose from one of PH's creations or make your own, which I prefer.  I've had a turkey bowl and a sirloin steak bowl, with either the quinoa or brown rice, adding mushrooms, tomatoes,or broccoli.  I monitor the portion sizes of my protein and carbs, and PH's menu helps by listing the ounces of their servings knowing that there are other people like me who want to know those details.  Andrew, the co-owner and the picture of muscle and fitness himself, has been there each time we've eaten there, manning the register and always checking on us after we get our orders. He said that nutritional info for all the menu items is coming soon, which will be another feather in PH's cap.  Eat clean, train mean -  try Protein House if this is your mantra.",

Tried it last night and was disappointed.   Ordered two Italian Stallion salads. Two salads are quite pricy ($12 each) and came to just over $25. For that price we expected great salads. To our shock the salads were TEENY tiny. After leaving a tip, paying almost $30 - we were given two salads that we both finished in about three bites. The chicken portion was very small and laughable. The \"dressing\" was clumpy and looked \"off\" (we used our own vinaigrette). If I was to guess I would also assume these salads were not made fresh and prepackaged, as the lettuce was wilting and soft, had some brown edges and asparagus was soggy?   Hard to mess up a salad but somehow they managed it. Felt slighted for the amount spent. Next time I want a good salad I will go to Cafe RIO next door and save $$$.   Going to wait some time and give PH some time to make improvements to their menu and operations before I return. It's a great concept, just need to step up quality and adjust prices slightly to better reflect the area. Have seen way too many places come and go in that immediate area. Hope they can make it!",

I came in late one evening and ordered a veggie and rice bowl. The restaurant was not busy and yet it was a mess. Where I stood to order my food you can see the kitchen area and there was food every where on the floor. If it were busy, it would be understandable.   After ordering, I sat down to wait for my order to get made and realized that one table was customers and another was employees and friends of theirs. The dining area had boxes, papers and junk all over the place. The floor was dirty and so were most of the tables. This annoyed me because it seemed they were almost over staffed and yet it was a huge mess in the place. They did chose to make the restaurant mostly white so I am sure this is why the mess stands out so much.   They had music playing and it was that music you would hear in a 'pump you up' cycling class. It was way too loud! I asked for a to go box and felt like we need to shout to hear each other. Too much. Who wants to eat with harsh base beats pulsing in their ears? That can not be healthy.   I ordered the veggie bowl with brown rice. It was decent but, I would not go out of my way to come back here. I do not remember if it seemed over priced or anything but the experience as a whole was 'meh'.  If I heard that things improved at this place I might give it another go but for now I will be passing.",

I was going to place my purse on the floor near my chair as I waited for my \"fresh\"  made-to-order Super Power juice but stopped when I saw stickiness on the floor. The glass table was just as grungy. Hoping the juice would make up for the sloppy table area, I waited...a long time.   I sipped and wanted to spit it out. It tasted spoiled! I juice at home frequently with a Vita Mix and now a Ninja. I know these flavor profiles very well and like them a lot when they are made fresh. I couldn't believe my taste-buds. How could fresh juice taste spoiled? I did something I rarely do. I went back to complain. The lady smiled and offered me another type. I tried the Detox, substituted cucumbers for celery. Although this one didn't have the Blah factor of the first one, I threw it out anyways because it tasted old.   When she was preparing my second juice the mystery of spoiled juice was revealed. This IS NOT FRESH JUICE. They have plastic containers in the fridge where they pour out OLD juice made in the morning, (the way my first juice  tasted SPOILED, I doubt its all made in the morning. You don't have room for fresh veggies? ( That's what I was told), what else don't you have room for? Now I get why the staff looked so serious. I hope the owners fix this soon. Paying 6.99 for stale juice is fraudulent when people are thinking they are getting fresh juice.",

Patrons consisted of alotta gym folk and lunch break goers, but it wasn't crazy busy so it was a good place for me to get some work done (free wifi, plus a couple of outlets for electronics--yay!).    I really like their bowls.  Fresh in quality and flavor.  I made my own bowl which consisted of steak, red onions, tomatoes, mushroom, cilantro, and feta over quinoa with a side of cilantro-lime vinaigrette.  It came out to about $14--not bad considering the quality of the food.  I also tried the lolo bowl (~$8), which was chocolate/peanut butter whey concoction, topped with granola, honey, strawberries, and bananas.  The foods really filling, and I had leftovers for another meal.    Service wasn't bad.  They serve things up on real plates and clean up after you when you leave.  The place is really well-kept and clean--including the bathrooms.  The back walls and bathroom are decorated with a bunch of pictures of fitness folk--bulging muscles and all--not my cup of tea, but I don't mind it.  They also have a huge TV for patrons to catch the latest sports highlights.  Overall, a good healthy option to try.",

When I pickup a takeout order I always look in each box to make sure everything is right, I failed to do so this time!  I took a quick peek at a few boxes, seemed to be right but I was wrong!!! When I got back to the office we opened our boxes and two out of four were wrong.  The two that were wrong were mixed up.  I drove back, they remade it but did not seem concerned about the quality of their services.  One staff member tried to bring me a left over smoothie to help out, cool dude..left over?  Uggh no thanks.   About a week later the office wanted to try it again, so this time I made sure to look in the boxes....well 3 out of 4 were right!  Of course, mine was the one they messed up on AGAIN!  I even looked in the box and it seemed to look good.   I did the \"make your own bowl\"  but I guess what I had asked for was too complicated for them because they ended up making a signature bowl they already offer.    ON THE TICKET/RECEIPT it is listed correctly so I do not know who is being lazy in the kitchen!    I did not go back to fix it, it just wasnt worth my time.

Protein House is in a strip mall in Green Valley.  I didn't have any problems finding the place nor parking.  I walked in and sat down and checked out the menu.  They have a pretty extensive menu that could fill all of my nutritional needs.  I decided to go with a protein bowl, called the Lolo bowl.  The bowl had Chocolate Whey Protein, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and oats.  It was really filling and a perfect treat for a hot summer day.  Loren and Skyler had a Mahi Tuna sandwich that looked amazing.  The decor was interesting.  There was a wall full of posters of hot fitness competitors, called the wall of fame.    I am pretty sure that I would return here to have a P.W.O. meal again.    I would love to see a nutritional breakdown for their meals there.  I am one that keeps tracks of my macros.

I love the idea of the place and I want it to do well but this is more of a place to go when you want to eat out but not feel guilty about it, but like any place that promotes healthy food suffers in the taste department.",

    "text": "Greens and Proteins on actual steroids. The walls are covered in bodybuilder photos, and the food is actually cooked rather than assembled down the way at Greens.   It is pricey, though. The cheapest thing on the menu is a $4.99 post-workout shake that is frothy and fluffy and delicious and a good thing for my post-yoga muscles. The bowls will run you $10-14, but I definitely have had enough for two meals so it's not too terrible.   Parking is kind of a drag since it is in a very cramped shopping center, especially during the lunch rush since there are so many places to eat in here. Recommended for healthy options in this area!",

Not happy about this, people have jobs and things to do.  When I came to pick up my order after I didn't receive the second email promised they notify us that they just received the order ! This is 45 minutes after I received two email confirmations about the order by Chowdown and by Protein. Pretty disappointed.",

Compared to something popular like SkinnyFats where they won't advertise their nutritional information, Protein House is all about giving you the information.  The food:  Signature Bowls - They have many types of bowls that are good sources of protein served over quinoa, brown rice or 50/50 both.  Each has a bit of veggies on it.  The El Jefe is a bit more expensive due to the amount of mean, since you are getting about 12 ounces of lean protein!  Southwest Bowl - Top Sirloin. Greek Bowl - Ground Turkey BBQ Bowl - Chicken Vegetarian Bowl - Bunch of good Veggies Teriyaki Bowl - Salmon El Jefe - Turkey and Bison  Signature Burgers - I haven't tried these yet, but we are talking Bison Meat, egg whites, chicken, turkey in their variety of different choices on the menu.    Smoothies - I also haven't tried these yet, but we are talking some serious healthy ingredients! 240 to over 600 calories depending on what you want.  Protein amounts will vary.  Breakfast - Love pancakes and I often don't eat them due to the carbs.  Here, they have multigrain Whey Pancakes with egg whites.  Whoo Hoo!  They also have plenty of other items like Hash, Quesadilla, and even loaded oatmeal that you can add protein to!  The place:  Great music, TV, and either tall boy tables, couch seating or regular tables. Clean, friendly, helpful.  This is generally a order, pay and pick up your food type of place.  The Extras:  If you like low sugar Quest Bars, they sell them here!.  They have coffees and Frappuccinos as well as some specials and juices!  I like this place, be sure to check it out!",

Items ordered today; BBQ grilled chicken bowl with half quinoa/half brown rice. Loads of broccoli, bell peppers, onions in a fluffy bed of quinoa and brown rice, chunks of grilled chicken with Paleo BBQ sauce, slices of avocado, it was filling and tasty. I also ordered the Sweet Greens juice, full of spinach, lime, cucumber, pear, Apple and agave, I asked for loads of extra ginger- zing pow! Hubby got the Peanut Butter Dream smoothie with almond milk and no yogurt, it was like a dessert. He also got the Muscle Builder burger (sin cheese) with a side of sweet potato mash. He said it was excellent.  Interior is clean and modern. Service was friendly.  Portions are big, but no organic options which is a bummer, but everything was still quite nutrient dense, good food combos.  Will return again.",

They have a very extensive menu which was a bonus and I might try them out for lunch (I had breakfast this visit). I got a Berry Blast Acai Bowl and while the portion was gigantic (For $11.00 Im glad it was) I only had a few bites because it honestly wasn't that good.  Maybe its me coming from San Diego, home of the perfected Acai Bowl, but this place was lacking. I've tasted crushed ice with more flavor.  On top of the lack luster food the people who work there are like really intimidating. Would it kill any of you to smile? They were seriously unfriendly, but after eating my Acai Bowl I understand why.",

If you're looking for a healthy place to grab a bite and refuel your muscles with lean protein and veggies and whole food carbs, this is where you come!   My favorites are the SHREDD bowl, the Vitamin c juice, and the PBJ pancake! -- their bison and steak in any meal are super tender and delicious! The PBJ Pancake has to be a favorite of mine when I'm having a sweets craving! It's made with whole wheat pasta and whey protein and sugar free jelly and peanut butter!   If you want to add flavor, there is a large assortment of condiments ranging from Sriracha to Liquid aminos!  If you download their app, you can get rewards and earn points towards future meals!   There may be protein cookies and brownies by the front counter too!",

While I struggle with having to follow a very restrictive diet this is one of the easiest places for me to order and not feel as though I'm being shorted on flavor.  This place also works great for my boyfriend because he loves to double up the meat. Online ordering is super easy and my takeout orders have always been correct. For a while I always ordered the Sexy Bitch bowl, but lately I've been leaning more towards the Hardcoreis Bowl. I don't really understand the name, but since I'm not really a hard core worker-outer I'll assume it has something to do with that. Lol Also the fresh juices are great. The prices here are a little high, but the quality is good. Definitely recommend this place.",

I must say, I look forward to trying out different bowls everytime I come. My favorite is the PH hash (Ground bison, egg whites, grilled sweet potatoes, red onions, celery, peppers) it travels well for breakfast and lunch on a Monday after traveling in a Sunday from LV to LA. I noticed they do meal preps as well and will look into that the next time we are in LV!   Today's purchases: cookies & cream iced latte, caramel macchiato iced latte, a teriyaki chicken bowl, and the el jefe bowl with no pineapples. Extremely satisfied with our choices today! Can't wait to try their plant based menu next time we are in town!",

After looked at the menu, I decided that I wanted to try the South Beach Pancakes because they are gluten free. I noticed the large black jugs of Muscle Infusion protein stacked on shelves above the food preparation area....and they did not appear to be an all natural whey protein brand.   I asked to review the ingredients of whey protein that they used in the pancakes (Muscle Infusion brand). This protein is LOADED with CORN SYRUP, SUCRALOSE, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED COCONUT OIL, and other unhealthy crap.   Being a healthy restaurant must extend beyond the marketing of a business; the ingredients used in your dishes must also be healthy.   God idea...bad execution.   My suggestion: Use an all natural brand of whey protein (whey is used as their protein ingredient in dishes) and stop putting artificial sweeteners, corn syrup, and other unhealthy stuff in your food.",

Then what I received was a a bowl with steak and chicken. Once they remade it I got disgusting salmon that was over cooked and with rice, even though they still up charged me for quinoa.

I am by the way the least muscular patron in here.  All in all a good experience.   Thank you all for taking time to read my reviews.",

Coming inside open minded, we stopped by the menu on the right to let the other people get in front of the line.  Out of the whole time, us looking confused (cause we've never been there before), no one offered to help with the menu.  We had to stop someone.  Food was mediocre.  Not a big fan. Seemed like the owners didn't appreciate our business.  Didn't feel welcomed at all & the food was too much for such mediocre taste",

It was both my friend and my first time here, the girl at the counter didn't seem interested in offering any suggestions or helping us. I decided to try the Greek Signature Bowl, turkey burger, tomato, black olives, feta, cucumber and red onion, and I chose quinoa for the carb. This was really lacking in flavor and for $9.99 I was really disappointed. I also didn't like that they didn't have the nutritional value available.  They don't sell soda or have a soda machine, yet they sell Crystal Lite and have 10+ sugar free syrups behind the counter, artificial sugar is just as bad as soda.   I don't see myself returning.

    "text": "---Rant---  If I could give this place **more than 5 stars***, I would~  Service-wise, I got a pretty good description of the food from a few different servers/staff.  In fact, the first time I was ordering their Peanut Butter Dream (protein shake) and asked for 3 extra scoops, the huge guy behind the counter (who I assume is also the owner) said \"no you don't want that because each scoop is 25 grams of protein, so that plus the peanut butter and the egg white...\"  I was totally stoked when he said that because most places like Jamba Juice and such give you a measly 10 grams of protein per scoop, which is total weaksauce!  Protein House gives you a whopping 25 grams of whey protein per scoop as well as different flavors!  EXCELLENT~  So over the course of a 7 day climbing trip, I ate here 5 days, mostly for dinner.  Tried the PH Hash, a DOUBLE Bison burger, their Quinoa Bowl, all of which were amazing, tasty, and most importantly for me, LOADED with protein!  Bodybuilding must be big in Vegas because the walls were plastered with signed autographs of some seriously hot IFBB Figure Competitors like Larissa Reis (actually there was A LOT of Larissa Reis all over the wall, and understandably so.  She's hot~).  My only negative comment is that there isn't one of these in California!!! I guarantee people in Newport Beach would pay more than what they charge in Henderson for this kind of quality and type of food!  Rock Climbing is like ALL DAY strength training/power lifting for your back/biceps/forearms.  Protein House gives me exactly what I need to recover from a long day of hard bouldering and class 3/class 4 hiking. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you want a great tasting, generously portioned, high protein meal for a reasonable price.  ---Overall---  Service: A, stellar  Food: A+, amazing food, high quality  Atmosphere: A+, Larissa Reis...'nuff said.",

    "text": "The Protein House on Eastern in Las Vegas Left Me Disappointed  My hubby and I are kind of health nuts, by that I mean we work out 5-6 days per week and eat a 98% non processed vegan diet.  I was with my son at Sams Club right nearby and was starving, so I thought that I would go out and check out the Protein House. I thought for sure it would be a healthy menu that I could get something I would not regret eating.  Walking in the Protein House, I felt a little uncomfortable, there was a huge guy, likely a body builder or fighter hovering over the cashier, and he didn't seem extremely friendly. But, I did take this as a good sign that bodies were the focus in this place and I liked that.   I was right, it is a healthy menu, however I do have a problem with a place that calls itself the \"Protein House\" or \"Greens and Proteins\" for that matter and they have not gotten with the times, that a lot of people do not eat meat anymore. This place does get \"kudos\" for having a vegan protein on the menu, which Greens and Proteins does not, but its vegetarian and vegan options for food are a little on the \"down low.\"  Why don't you have tofu options for your salads, bowls, etc? or Gardein? Heck the Yardhouse has an entire Gardein menu, get a clue!  They have a black bean and quinoa veggie burger and a veggie bowl. The veggie bowl can be quinoa or brown rice and I love both, but they don't come with a sauce. So, I asked what the sauce was and they looked at me like I was crazy. It doesn't come with a sauce they said, do you want a sauce on the side, and I said yes. What do you have?   The girl was very nice and said we have bbq, teriyaki, balsalmic, blah blah many others. Ok, so I went with teriyaki as I am vegan and I figured this would be the least likely to get messed up with some cheese or cream or something so I chose that one. I specifically asked for NO mushrooms, its the one veggie that I hate.  I had to ask how to get my bottle of water and it was uncomfortably quiet in there while I waited for my food, except for the massive TV with the SF 49r's game on and my six year old which were great contributions to the action. They have a table set up in the back that appears to be their office, I found that tacky... now I have some ideas if they want them to make that table cool and fit the theme, like make it a judges table, autograph table or nutrition booth or something, but to sit out there in the public like that is just unprofessional.   When I did receive my food, it was FULL of mushrooms, but I was starving and it wasn't meat or cheese so I attempted to pick them out as I went along. The veggies were gorgeous, asparagus, peppers, cauliflower, zucchini and the quinoa was cooked perfectly. My only suggestion is for them not to cut the veggies up so small, this is the main part of the veggie dish and they were diced teeny tiny seeming like I was still missing the main dish.  Oh, the sauce... well the first sauce was my teriyaki and it looked creamy! How does teriyaki get creamy? I don't know, but I'm not eating it. I asked for something else, I got the balsamic. It looked chunky and not like any balsamic I have ever seen. So, unfortunately my opinion on the sauces is very poor. If you serve a bowl of any kind, don't you need a sauce?  I guess I'm the only one who ever asked for a sauce as they looked at me like an alien when I asked for one. Last but not least. SALT. I know, its not the best for you, but I need flavor on my food.  At the Protein House, I walked around and found pepper but no salt. And, they couldn't find salt. I mean I know you are a bunch of manly and womanly body builder types, but 99% of the population wants some salt on their food.  They finally found me some in the kitchen in a cabinet and had to put it in a little dish for me. Wow, Gordon Ramsay would have had a hay day with that episode.  All in all, I appreciate the whole idea of the place, its supposed to be trendy and focused on body building, but they have to be realistic that the bodybuilding population is such a small percentage of their potential revenue, that they have to open their minds to all the other healthy people out there that might want to eat there.  After today, I will not go back, unless of course I see a change of the way I was treated or (sized up), the menu and the atmosphere. Otherwise if they were going on food only, minus the mushroom mistake, the food concept is one that I would love!",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times mainly because I didn't feel like cooking my own protein meal/making a juice/shake. I've had their Teriyaki Bowl with quinoa and their Muscle Burger as a lettuce wrap. It actually looks like they've changed their menu since I've last been here... they don't have juices anymore but I've had a juice that was called like the Hang Over Cure or something... and some other juice that tasted a bit better than whatever was in the hang over one.  The Teriyaki bowl was okay. The salmon was a bit dry. The bowl could have used more sauce/flavor. I was really hungry when I was eating it and rushing over to a photo shoot though, so I wasn't exactly sitting and enjoying the meal, moreso shoveling it into my mouth.  The muscle burger as a lettuce wrap was impossible to eat as a lettuce wrap. I had to take my knife and fork to it. And there definitely wasn't enough lettuce or onions. Really just a ton of meat and cheese. And it definitely wasn't cooked medium. I only got this because the owner, at least I'm assuming the owner, recommended it. I barely put a dent into this monster when my stomach decided it wanted nothing more to do with it. I knew I should have asked for it without the cheddar cheese, but I didn't, and I literally couldn't function for the rest of the day. I'm assuming the cheese and resulting grease was the culprit as I've been on a really clean diet for a couple months already.  I took the rest home where I discarded the cheese. The meat ended up tasting pretty bland. The sweet potatoes were good though.  I haven't been a fan of the customer service. The girls at the counter always seem aloof, looking like the girls who get dolled up to go to the gym and act like they're better than you. The other workers who look like body builders just seem to keep to themselves. The only friendly interaction I've had with a worker was the guy who recommended the muscle burger to me.",

    "text": "After so many trips to Vegas, my buddies and I decide to head out and eat something healthy, after this week of overindulgence. With it being the anniversary of Protein House, we figured that it was about time. As you enter the establishment, you can tell that its not kept up very well. The cashiers was kind of nice, but I couldn't tell since she never smiled. There was one petit girl who was busing all the tables, and she was the reason I left the tips, since she was having to tend to all this solo. Ordered the Muscle Builder, and BBQ turkey Burger, with mashed sweet potatoes and sweet potato pieces... It might be healthy, but you can definitely be more creative in making food taste better. I never went back for the water, because that dispenser was filthy. I'm not talking about just a little splash back, but hard water stains, and other colored spots. Mind you, this only dispenses water and ice, so there's no explanation for the other stains. The water in the catch can was overflowing, with things in it. I never went for water, so that I could keep my meal down. The 2nd star was for the 10% check-in offer, but I gave that money back in tips. I might've just not tipped at all, if I knew you had to get your own food at the serving station.   On a side note... The clientele and some staff must've been on a low carb week or something. The vibe in that place when stepping in, eating, and exiting had a very strong air of \"douchiness\". Call me crazy, but I like to eat good food, in a clean and happy environment. Even with good looking physiques, there was a lot of overcompensating from the men and women in there. Not sure I'd be back, because of all these factors. You can find comparable food, for the same or less.",

Perfectly cooked salmon over a bed of quinoa! With some veggies. It was Phenomenal! You can taste the fresh ingredients!! Also an honorable mention would be the fact that they have no soda machine! I love that! I hate seeing a health based restaurant serving soda! If you're like me it's hard enough to be watching your weight. With that said will power is damn near non existent! So it's nice to not have any temptations! The only thing negative I would say is the prices are somewhat high! I would definitely suggest this place to anyone!!!",

I've read a few other reviews on here & if you're not into \"clean eating\" than this place probably isn't for you.    The food isn't doused in sodium, there aren't any soda machines & their condiment options include stevia.  Now this is health at its best.  Don't let the wall of bodybuilders intimidate you.  If anything, the staff is really friendly.  My only complaint is that my muscle-head BF & I would love to see another location in N. Las Vegas :)",

    "text": "Was excited to go, as it was recommended to us by friends. Unfortunately, it was not all we had expected.   Service was OK, as the person who took our order didn't know the nutritional value of the menu items, which you would expect in a \"body builders\" paradise. The menu had a lot of choices, with some specific GF options, however, anyone who is Gluten Free knows that any meal can be combined to make it GF. What about wheat and soy free?  What about other allergies?  They are not addressed at all.  Also, if you're seated, they call your number or name from behind the counter, rather than bringing you your order.  I don't need to workout and get my meal, if I'm sitting sipping tea with friends/colleagues and picking up our meals in plastic bowls with plastic utensils just added to our disappointment, and without trays, took a few trips to the counter, which took time away from a nice lunch. Add a tacky \"tip cup\" at the register, made the obligation uncomfortable as there was no \"service\", as after the meal, we had to return our bowls to the counter.   The restaurant was clean, with a nice vibe, contemporary, but a little over the top with the owner overly self promoting with her photos everywhere and we  were tired of looking up at the walls.  Then it continued all the way into the bathroom. Exhausting and overdone.   Focus should be in the food, service and ambiance. Like any good food establishment, especially one that is supposed to pride itself on nutrition, there is no nutritional values attached to any item on the menu.   It's a place to visit ONCE to try the assorted menu items, as I always give the opportunity for improvement, which is why I gave it 3 stars, rather than my first choice of 2 stars.   For the price and service, there are too many other great options in the area to eat in or take out a great, nutritional meal. I feel that this is a promotional platform for the owner, not a nutritional, \"stay fit\" establishment.",

My favorite thing on the menu so far is the \"PH burger\". It's a bison meat burger with an incredibly fresh wheat bun.  The environment is relaxed with an upbeat vibe. EDM is typically playing throughout the day, which keeps the atmosphere young. The restaurant itself is clean and well maintained by a staff, and the owners, who care about food, fitness and their customers.   No complaints about this place other than the chairs being a little squeaky ;)",

I was never greeted and I did feel a bit like I was bothering them when I gave them my order.  The space is great and everything I ordered was very good.  So good, that I was back a few days later.
