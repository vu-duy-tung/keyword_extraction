    "text": "Delicious Italian! We order the same meal each time we go: shrimp cocktail for an app with the complimentary garlic bread, then for your entree get the meatball with ricotta appetizer (one HUGE meatball) and an order of spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce. Do this instead of ordering spaghetti and meatballs - better deal. Then, save room for dessert and get the Oreo Zeppole, 6 fried Oreos that you dip in a vanilla milkshake. It's sinful but oh so amazing and you will be craving that meal until your next trip to Vegas!   My only complaint is the really loud, bumping music. Take it down a notch!",

    "text": "RESTAURANT: I went to Lavo on a Saturday night with my sister for dinner. We made reservations the day before and was surprised the restaurant wasn't completely booked yet. We shared  the caesar salad and the four cheese ravioli. I had read on yelp that the caesar salad was great so we decided to try it. The caesar salad was the business! It was huuuge and delicious. I think it was the best salad I've ever had.  The pasta was okay, I think we should have got the spaghetti insead. For dessert we got gelato - vanilla and caramel, which was amazing. Our server could have been more personable and friendly, not so matter-of-fact but he did his job and we were happy with our meal. The restaurant is very beautiful and has a sopshicated, sexy vibe yet laid back. I will definetly come back on my next trip to Las Vegas.  CLUB: My sister and I decided to check out Lavo after we went to Tao on a Thursday night. We weren't hotel guests, weren't on the guest list nor are we locals but we got in for free with no fuss which was nice. The club is upstairs and very small/intimate. It was pretty packed.  The go-go dancers looked bored and had no rhythm. I was surprised the the DJ was playing latin music, since I thought the club played top 40/pop/hip hop like most other clubs, but maybe it was latin music night? Not sure if I would go back to the club, unless the music was better. I think this place is probably hit or miss.",

On my most recent visit, it was unbearably crowded, but I'm not sure it's fair to fault a club for that. The crowd itself is quite friendly, and everyone is having a good time. Be careful if you're really drunk or wearing very high heels (high probability for that in Vegas), because you have to go up quite a bit of stairs to get into the club area.",

TINY, Cramped, and Terrible!  My girls and I met a promoter who put us on a guest list so we got free admission and free drinks... well, they told us be there at 10:15 but doors don't open til 10:30. Fine. We get upstairs, free drinks don't start until 11 pm. That was annoying because that was all we went there for. Actually, it wasn't even worth the free drinks.  This club shouldn't even be called a club, it's just so small. Few bars and not enough bar tenders. I'd never buy VIP at this place because you get a tiny little table and maybe 2 seating spaces. For me VIP is about having your own little space, well you don't get that here.   The music was TERRIBLE! The DJ was horrible, didn't know how to mix the music, and it was a total buzz kill. Thank goodness we stayed less than an hour and made our way to Surrender...   I'll never go to Lavo again!",

As you walk in, you cross over the main restaurant via an overhead walkway. On both sides of this walkway, small marble fountains illuminate your path. As you enter the club, at the base of the stairs, two hot dancers are feeling each other up seductively in a bath tub. Drinks are strong and the music is fantastic.   Only reason for the 4 stars - too crowded. There wasbhardly room to stand let alone buy drinks, walk to the dance floor and dance. Someone spilled their drink on my shirt.

Before we got any food or drink, a waiter tripped and dropped his serving tray on my shoulder. It startled me and it also bugged the crap out of me that he never apologized. My own server said she was sorry but he did not. Usually when something like that happens the manager comes by to make sure you're ok, but here, nothing. I let my server know I was bothered by his lack of interest that he conked me on the shoulder but she didn't seem to really care that much. If I really wanted to get into it I could have gone to the manager but due to the fact that I was with a larger party and uninjured, I let it ride. The music during dinner could have been more quiet; we had to shout. Nightclub was fun, since we ate there, we could walk upstairs for free. DJ was really good, and the vibe was fun.

We enjoyed the almond-crusted french toast very much! The fresh squeezed orange juice was a delight and the coffee had just the right amount of kick to ease us into our day. The restaurant itself is beautiful, adding to the enjoyment of the meal.   The breakfast panini looked nothing like the picture of it on the website and was a bit flat. The fruit plate was flavorful (particularly the persimmon), but the plating was disheveled.   We will happily return and urge you to make it part of your next Vegas itinerary!",

I called to make reservations and was excited to go there as a late dinner because we wanted to hang out at the lounge after our meal. I specifically asked the girl that I booked reservations through what time the dj comes on and made our dinner based in that (she said 10pm). we get there at 9pm on a Thursday  (it's pretty empty)and have a drink at the bar and ask the bartender where the lounge is and he says \"oh he lounge is currently closed for renovations\". So that was a major bummer be we had based our night around that. So anyway we had dinner and it was Good-shared a bunch of things from the grilled octopus to the meatballs to pasta. All food was good but overall I was disappointed based on the lounge situation.",

Our seats were sooo close to the other table I felt as though we were being listened to and there was zero sense of a romantic evening in our future.   We sat down and our waiter soon came, very nice guy (forgot his name) ordered our drinks and then took our orders. We started with the polenta fries and the complimentary garlic bread. I loved both but hubby didn't care for the polenta fries, he's super picky. Then on to our dinner, my hubby ordered the chicken parm and said it was just meh. For $28 it should have been wow! I however loved my dinner! I ordered the spicy pasta with clams, scallops, huge shrimp and mussels. It was spicy but I loved that! Oh and the scallops were sooo tiny but there was so much other yimmyness in my bowl I didn't even care! Overall, this place was nice but we won't probably be back. For $200 for a nice dinner out we should have been wow'd and there was zero wow factor for us! Way to many amazing places in Vegas",

    "text": "We are locals and support the 3square restaurant week. We narrowed our options for the last night to Charlie Palmer or LAVO. We decided LAVO. When we arrived we were asked if we would prefer to sit inside or outside. We said inside and then the hostess proceeded to walk us to our table. She took us outside. We told her we asked for inside and she said she misheard. We told her it was a nice night so outside was fine. She then had us wait for her to go and talk to her manager? So then when we finally were sat we felt like we were unwanted and rushed the whole time. Our waitress seemed annoyed that we were there. She had an attitude when we told her we didn't need the full menu because we were there for restaurant week and literally made me feel like she thought I was poor and not worth her time. She didn't even take the menus when our order was placed, like usual. When she did come back for them I told her I'd like to keep the cocktail menu and she threw the rest of them back on the table with the same \"I'm wasting her time\" attitude. I ran out of water and she passed my table many times and never noticed, while addressing the tables around us regularly. Finally I had to ask a passing bus boy for more water after I got desperate. (Sure asking for water isn't a huge deal but LAVO is supposed to be elevated and not cheap). The food was delicious but when it came time for dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and without telling us they ran out, they just brought us 2 of something we didn't order or want. A Nutella cake..... again it was tasty but not what I wanted and to bring it as a replacement without even asking or telling us about the mishap is unprofessional. They finally offered to let us choose a new dessert option after the manager came over and apologized for the dessert  but it didn't make up for it, and I'll never be going back. That didn't make up for the rest of the night. The 2 stars I gave were for the food taste only. The lack of the 3 were based on the unprofessionalism, and attitude towards customer service.  We should have went to Charlie Palmer steak or a Jose Andres again.",

That is how we chose to go to LAVO on a Saturday night. Between four girls we ordered the meatball with salad, truffle fries, margherita pizza, spinach and artichoke pizza, ravioli, and rigatoni. It was SO much food. We could have split two pizzas and the meatball. But, the food was all delicious. My spinach and artichoke pizza was one of the best / most unique pizzas I've had in a while. The ambiance of LAVO is really cool and they play good music, just loud enough so you can still chat with your friends easily. Service was friendly and attentive. I'm giving four stars instead of five because the inside of the meatball was cold and the truffles fries were a bit cold too. The main dishes were awesome.",

    "text": "So this place is technically located in the Palazzo and not the Venetian. It's better to walk on the street to get to the entrance than trying to go through the casino to get between the two. We went here for a New Years Eve party and I have to say I had a great time. The food they had was standard bar fare, but delicious. The tempura shrimp was the best part. Honestly, everyone was more interested in the drinks anyway. Luckily, they had multiple bars set up all over the downstairs and the upstairs part of the club so the line wasn't too long. the bartender mixed us some pretty amazing LITs all night long.   I think this place would be really nice as a regular restaurant during the day as well, but by 12 on New Years Eve it was just trashed. They really needed to have a better clean up staff. There were empty cups and half eaten food everywhere. Having a hallways filled with sinks with running water is a nice decorative touch, but to drunken guests on NYE, its just another place to vomit. Also, after midnight, people started to leave to the sister club, Tao, for Snoopdog's New Year party so the place cleared out pretty quickly. The patio was a nice place to watch the fireworks, but obviously way too crowded to be pleasant. Also, you can't really see the fireworks on the rest of the strip from there. We had a good time, for the time that we were there, but clearly, this was just a place to start the night for some people.",

We were staying at Palazzo & had a pretty crappy ratio (more guys than girls overall, though last minute, some of the guys decided not to go clubbing & we had an even ratio) so we decided to try our luck at LAVO. Especially because it was FREEZING outside and no one wanted to trek out of the hotel. If you are a guest at the hotel, you can get yourself on the Concierge's guestlist. But honestly, I'm not sure how strict they are with guestlist because the promoter/bouncers didn't even check a list. All they cared about was how many females are in your party.   the good: - guys can (potentially) get in free if you have at least a 1:1 ratio. which we did have, but SOME SHIESTY PARTY OF GUYS in front of us absorbed our party and TOOK OUR FREE GUY PASSES. What d-bags. So our guys had to pay $30 each.  - we were there for Vice Sunday and the music was REALLY GOOD. Mostly hip hop & the mixes were awesome.  - Lines were pretty short around 10:30pm.  - they threw out free glowsticks!!!   the bad: - dance floor is ridiculously small. packed like sardines. which is serious buzzkill for those of us who likes to dance!",

My biggest problem with Lavo was the service, from start to finish. Checked in for my 830 reservation & was told they were \"running a little behind\". Fine. 45 minutes later we finally got seated. No apology. No \"let me buy you a drink while you wait\". No manager checking on us or offering anything for the inconvenience.  Tables are, of course, on top of each other. Waiters do a good job, but are over loaded. They are running constantly. Do not look for too much attention.   Lastly, we had a \"mystery charge\" on our bill, which I assume most people pay unnecessarily if they don't read the check. I understand mistakes happen & I wouldn't mention this as a negative except that I noticed the same waiter had the same \"mistake\" with the couple two tables away from us immediately before we paid our bill. I guess we weren't ordering enough to run up the bill so they did it for us. Of course, no apology was forthcoming from, the manager upon his correction of this error either.  With all of the restaurant choices in Vegas (or just at The Venetian for that matter) I am surprised this place is surviving.  I'll never go back.",

The ratio was literally 4 girls to 1 guy and more girls just kept coming in.  Once 3:30pm starts the lights go down and it becomes a nightclub! Super fun and chill environment.   Food was good at the bar and the drinks are strong. There is an outside patio too which was nice.   Tiesto was there when I went and he was partying it up. You get Champagne goggle glasses to protect your eyes and it's just one crazy party!   Definitely coming back during non-pool season",

An ornate space clearly befitting its trendy nightclub roots with friendly, though somewhat cocktail-pushy service and excessive hyperbole (no, your chef did not 'create' the cronut, nor was he the first to coat chicken with the cap'n) it was with the aforementioned bread basket, freely refilled coffee, and a cocktail that our meal began and with the basket particularly impressive given its complimentary nature it was much to my delight that the rest of the cuisine followed suit; substantial delay due to our waiter flirting with two tables full of sorority girls notwithstanding.  Electing to sample two sweets and two savories it was with a trio of selections and the smooth, dense, and semi-molten-centered bread pudding to follow that our meal progressed and attempting to abstain from exaggeration I will simply say that if I returned I'd be hard pressed not to order the exact same thing, the French Toast harkening a fruit infused Bostock and the pasta a peerless example of knowing how to use truffle oil with restraint, the end result a dish warranting an extra slice of focaccia to sop up every drop of the eggy aromatic cheese.",

So we ended up with all the servers behinds in our face and them bumping into us to serve the huge party their food. My fiance had us moved and to where? The patio. Was basically empty and more quiet. We started off with some female server then another server came up to her and accused her of stealing his table? So we ended up with him instead now. The other wait staff was really nice and attentive. my fiance had the \"Dominic crispy chicken\" there was nothing cripsy about it - merley browned if that. I had the chicken parmigiano and it tasted great but the chicken didn't look cooked. Looked extra white. Next day both of us woke up with stomach issues. For the price of Lavo they should know how to make chicken. Come on. We are locals and will not be back. I would recommend to go to maggiano's instead. I always read about how they make birthday desserts anniversary desserts - I put on The reservation we were celebrating two anniversaries and we got offered nothing",

    "text": "Amazing as always. For those who complain about reservations and getting pagers, they can't control when people sit there talking for hours after they're done eating. The experience is worth the 10 minute wait. On a Friday night at 9:30pm, we were seated in 2 minutes.   The restaurant has a live dj, and the atmosphere is a little loud. There was an older couple next to us who really didn't like the music (typical dance music with some 90s remixes), but there was a few bachelorette parties who seemed to enjoy it.   Their signature drinks are amazing (try the white tiger) or call your own. The bartenders are friendly and have a heavy hand if you put your phone down and talk to them.   Food. Beef carpaccio is worth every penny if you're into the raw stuff. After trying it at dozens of restaurants in Vegas, I can say hands down, this is the best. The pizzas are to die for, and the spinach and artichoke is no exception. Spaghetti and meatballs is great to if you want pasta, and the steaks are just as great if you're craving meat. I'm not a seafood person but people I've gone with, rave about the fish as well. The (free) garlic bread they bring you, will fill you up as well because you can't stop eating it.   When you're done, try the Oreo zeppole and hope you've saved room. They're battered and deep fried and come out very soft. The other desserts are good, but this one is the best - ask your server, it's the most popular.   Needless to say, I will keep coming back.",

I think next time I'm gonna try the food here =P  But anyway, came here on my last night in Vega$$$ (sunday) with 4 others and had a good time. My friend's friend was celebrating her birthday and apparently got a table so that's why we decided to hit up LAVO or else I would have had no plans and just chilled for the last night since I went clubbing both Friday & Saturday nights and my feet were sooo beat up from being stepped out, my new heels breaking in..etc. =T  But nonetheless, had a good time with good company. Pregamed with captain morgan (ugh) but it did its job and got me prettty buzzed by the time I got in the club. ^_^ Luckily, my friend was a promoter so got us in pretty quick. The lines weren't that long yet 'cause we arrived around 10. The club has a nice interior, much smaller, and it was poppin'.   Drink prices are the usual. Forgot what I ordered for my homeboys, pineapple and vodka/rum? I forgot.. and they don't even remember. LOL  The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars though... is the crowd. Mehhh. Got to the dance flo and wasn't that pleased even when I was buzzed! But it's all good, still had a good time!! Danced with my girlfriend all night long :o) Got so tired around 1 and left 'cause we were getting hungry.. so we missed DJ Vice's birthday celebration.    P.S. I loveeed walking through Venetian. Sooo purttty =)",

A promoter stopped my twin and I in the street and invited us to go so we said why not.   It was a Sunday and I had no clue what the parties were like on that day, or how the crowds or bouncers would be. But the bouncers were nice and we got right in and headed up to the club. When I hear \"nightclub\" I think monstrous open space. That would make Lavo a lounge...a pretty small one. We got there at a decent time and it was already pretty full, but an hour later it was just too cramped to enjoy (I'm more of a sexy lounge type of girl).   As others noted, the crowd was most definitely Asian. I was there with my sister to have fun so I really didn't care, but people looking to pick up someone (or be picked up) should keep it in mind if they're expecting a more diverse selection.   But regardless, I did enjoy myself (without alcohol, I might add) and might check it out again if I was in town. The DJ was pretty awesome that night and I still have my foam glow sticks = )",

The dance floor was crowded, like, just move your shoulders up and down crowded. We did that for a couple of songs and just headed to the bar. The entire club was packed and we actually got good service from the bar tenders. We found a little area by the back bar and just danced there and ordered drinks.  Dance Floor = Small, but fun MUSIC = I liked it! Bunch of great beats for Dancing. DRINKS = A little pricey, but, it is Vegas! My wallet wasn't hurting after a night of drinking. VIEW = Lots of good looking peeps to check out.  We had a GREAT time here and would come back again. Others may have been disappointed or upset, but, I don't go out to clubs as much as I used to, and this was just plain fun! You do need to get over the fact that you get pushed and sometimes there is a line for the rest room, but, it's a club and you will find that at any other club, no matter how nice it is.  I would definitely suggest finding a VIP promotionto get into this place. We did not wait long in the VIP line.   Looking forward to going back!",

Like the name implies, it's going for a bathhouse motif. Walking across a bridge with running faucets that overlooks the restaurant and up a staircase where two scantily-clad hotties in a bathtub are making out and into the club which features about 40 tables, two go-go dancers doing their thing, a moderate size dance floor and a bar area. Awesome.  A more mature, sophisticated crowd. Everyone seemed to be having a good time, I know I was. DJ played it safe and inoffensive, nothing but classic hits.  I will say that the drinks were pricey. I get that it's a club, but $19 for a gin and tonic? Really?! I haven't paid that in SF, NY, or LA, so why is Vegas charging that??) I also find it interesting that they apparently have gender-based prices: my wife and her male cousin both ordered the same beer: hers was $5 and his was $9. Huh. Never seen that before.   Bottle service starts at around $550 and run upwards of $3k, but the table hostesses all seemed hot, friendly and they dance at the tables, so you're probably paying a bit more than usual but you're also getting more too.  But at the end of the day, I had a great time and I'd go again.",

    "text": "I came here last Friday for dinner (see Public House review).  I'm Local, and this was my 2nd visit in 5 yrs or so. ATMOSPHERE- Just the way I like, dark, rich and great decor.  We were 'walk-ins' around 7pm or so.  Hostess did not 'insult' when we said we did not have reservations. We were seated at at 2-top in about 10-15 min. No bad. But 2-top so close to next 2-top we almost had \"dinner guests\". We had a glass candle holder-nice, two glasses of water along with salt/pepper...I asked the waitress \"where are we going to put our plates, and salads on this tiny table?\"  Note to self: NEVER AGAIN. FOOD- (my guy and I usually share because we don't like to take food home). I told our waitress we planned to share and would need extra plates.  She was very kind and upbeat.  We enjoyed the garlic bread with marinara sauce --complimentary. Our order: wedge salad, eggplant appetizer and of course one of their famous  'Meat Balls'  ($22), we both had a glass of ZIN.  What a pleasant surprise- the waitress had our salad divided BEFORE serving.  This was the largest wedge salad I have ever seen.  I am sure the price was high, I don't remember- but I was impressed... And the taste was also great.  Here came the 'meatball' (we ordered the one with Ricotta on top and it looked like a mtn of whipped cream)  YUMMM IS ALL I CAN SAY! and this 'ball' is big enough to share with 4 if needed.   Now to the eggplant, our waitress said it was her 'favorite', but 'heavy'.  She explained the eggplant is sliced lengthwise in very,very thin sheets and layered like lasagna.  This was delicious, but a meal for 2 hungry or 4 to taste and enjoy--yes very filling and I had to take home and gave to my daughter.  So, with that said, the salad and meatball would be perfect for two. SERVICE- great. NOISE- NOISE and, oh I almost forgot-NOISE- This place was the loudest with yelling people trying to talk over each other that I've been in for longer than I can remember.  The music in background, OK, the yelling, crazy.  Our 'almost dinner guest' next to us actually screamed to get some friends passing by to see them- this scream right into my ear, I actually jumped.  The friends then huddled around our teenie table and one actually used my guy's chair back to lean on all during their over 5 minute visit.  Yep they were going to 'Old town' and yep they would meet up later and yep they reviewed their food YA-DA-YA-DA. This, not the fault of LAVO, just rude people. PRICE- \"Vegas Gourmet\"...you got it... $$$   That's a mea-ta-ball!",

If my group hadn't thrown down for bottle service ---LET ME HEAR ALL YOU OUT OF STATERS ---there is no doubt this place ---- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, UUUUUGH ----would have gotten one star ---RIP MICHAEL JACKSON---. It was really crowded ---PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU WERE BORN IN THE 70S OR 80S-----and the dance floor is really ---WHO'S FROM CALIFORNIA-----small.   The DJ spinning the night we went was horrific, but he seems to love to hear himself talk and somehow he thinks he's \"world renowned\". For the entire night, there wasn't one song he didn't interrupt. There are some songs that just shouldn't be messed with or interrupted but he couldn't make it 45 seconds without hollering. It messed up the groove and wrecked songs.   Luckily nothing can get a bachelorette party down.",

Even if I could get in here for free (which, being a reasonably unconnected regular dude, that won't be happening), I would not.  I don't know what is wrong with the bartenders here, but when you get not one but two AMFs that taste like water, that's a BIG red flag.    Also, the club itself is pretty darn small so it gets crowded VERY quickly.  Trying to get from one side of the club to another anytime around midnight is an exercise in futility that only the brave and flexible should attempt.  This makes it extremely uncomfortable when you're trying to do anything useful like, say, breathing.  Or moving.  Or getting away from the drunk cougar who's trying to put her hand in your pocket.    Which reminds me, the crowd here is definitely older.  Avoid this place entirely.",

If you compare this place to Carluccio's Tivoli Garden or Buca di Beppo, the quality should be better, and it simply was not.   I was here when the club was packed. Lines were filling up the entire casino corridor and I felt like I had to get through so many people just to find the group to which I was joining.   If the dinner wasn't free, I would have been an unhappy person that is for sure!  Comped dinners probably don't allow you to order whatever you want, so that may be a factor in my experience, but I was still not impressed and this is what I have to share about this place...",

We actually had to wait 30 minutes beyond our reservation, but the resulting choice of a free appetizer was complete redemption (calamari - best I've ever had.)  I had the Spaghetti with Kobe Beef Meatballs.  As a huge Italian fan, I think spaghetti is the real measure of a restaurant, and this was as good as I can remember.  The portion size is overwhelming, so eat the meatballs early, or you will suffer pasta remorse.  As a side note, my wife's Chicken & Mushroom Ravioli was great as well, but couldn't compete with this.  Dessert sounded appetizing, but as much as we wanted to, neither of us could handle it after the main course.  I'm coming back next time I'm in Vegas.",

She offered to take us outside for our second drink (both Proseccos as we are celebrating our 40th anniversary!)  we sat outside on comfy couches with a view of Treaure Island and theit pirate ships all lit up. t was a nice way to end an evening.

To be honest the setting is great - nice lofty, extravagant restaurant feel you want when you're in Vegas but the food was just a bit 'meh' and the worst thing was the air-conditioning. We had to ask to be moved to a more central table just to get body heat off the rest of the diners and we saw other tables do the same or put their jackets back on.   We were a group of 4 and share 2 pizzas and 2 salads - which were all just ok. The pizza's were fairly dry as they only seemed to use chopped tomatoes as a sauce base rather than any passata and the salads were measly for around $18-19 a pop!  It was Ok but I wouldn't rush back.",

I ordered the fettucini alfredo that could have come out of any Italian restaurant.  My sister's pasta was overly adante....or more like undercooked.  The service was slow and inattentive for a popular restaurant.  They brought out the appetizer before giving us any plates.  We even had to ask for plates haha maybe they wanted us to go at it savage style.  The best part of the meal was the complimentary garlic bread.  The decor and atmosphere was very nice.  Good for business meetings, dates and friends' outings.    The reason for the extra star is because we came back for the nightclub and they put us in front of the line and gave us a complimentary table and drinks :)  Way to make a customer feel special!  The club area was small as well as the dance floor.  The music wasn't really my style as they were playing some random oldies.  The stairs on the way out were poorly lit, or rather not lit at all, causing my sis to fall.  But a second after, we were surrounded by flashlights and 8 gentlemen catering to our every need so plus to them for noticing!  I would come back again for the club, maybe not the restaurant.",

But before I get into my ordered food, I have to discuss the garlic bread. If I told you there was crack in here you'd understand and still eat it. This is the best garlic bread in the world.   For an app I got the calamari, which was excellent. Entree I had a chicken parm that was only 10% smaller than my plate. I was shocked when it didn't come with a side of spaghetti, but honestly it would've gone to waste. This was the emperor of chicken parm.  And lastly but honestly you should probably eat this first because it's so good is the Oreo zeppole. Dip it in the shake, eat it whole, take small bites, do whatever you need to eat this little piece of heaven.  Whenever I'm in town again I'm guaranteeing another trip.",

Highly recommend it - $65 per person and gives you a well rounded group of items. A few included : 2 cuts of steak - Filet & Bone-In Rib Eye - which were the best items we had. The Center Cut Filet literally melted in your mouth and came with an amazing home made steak sauce. So much favor. Also included their famous Meatball (with that we were all literally eating the excess marinara sauce off the plate by itself once we finished the meatball, it was that tasty), Chicken Parm, Salmon with zucchini noodles, 2 types of pasta, pizza, calamari, and more.

    "text": "Disappointed again. Gave LAVO a second chance out of convenience since we were staying at the Palazzo. With all the restaurant options in Vegas I won't be giving it a third.  First...host was rude.  Second...the tables are just way to close together.  You are practically bumping elbows with your neighbor. Third... they had one house Cabernet by the glass option and it was $25 a glass!  However, they had 4 other red options for $15... most people who order red wine  by the glass just ask for a Cabernet so this seems like deceitful.  The food....was cold and over priced.   We got the grilled octopus appetizer.  Lacked flavor. We also got the sauteed mushrooms.  Luke warm at best and again no flavor.  How do you mess up mushrooms?!  We also got the beet salad.  It was ok.  We decided that since we were unimpressed with the apps we were not going to order the $40 dollar entrees.  Server was inattentive and after he realized we were not going to order entrees he put the check down and was rushing us out of there.   They need to work on their customer service and although their menu is really nice, their chefs might need something to get them excited again.",

My husbands only complaint was he could have done with more shrimp in his seafood Alfredo. Definitely will visit this restaurant again the next time I'm in Vegas",

    "text": "I see and read about situations such as this in the news, and I know people say it all the time, but it is True! I NEVER thought I would be a victim of racial profiling.  I am an honorably retired veteran who was forward deployed to 4 war zones to uphold the rights and freedom of all Americans!  This is an injustice that I must speak out about.  It was simply wrong!  On June 29, 2019, around 11 pm.  I entered the Lavo restaurant at the Venetian/Palazzo casino to meet up with some friends.  I went to the hostess desk and said that my friends were already inside seated and I wanted to join them.   After I finished my sentence, the manager that was also standing at the hostess desk, said that I could not enter the restaurant.  I asked him why.  He said the restaurant kitchen was closed.  I replied that my friends were already seated, and they ordered my food already.  He repeated that I could not enter the restaurant.  At this time, I called one of my friends, who was waiting for me and said, the manager will not let me in, please come to the front so that he can see that I am not lying.  Shortly after my friend came to the hostess desk.  When he arrived, the manager told him she could not come in.  My friend asked him 'Why?!\"  The manager did not respond.  My friend then looked at me and said, \"OK, do not worry about it, we will pack up your food and bring to you.\"  I replied, \"OK,\"  then my friend went back to his table.  I pulled out my cellphone camera and began recording in the direction of the manager, and asked again, \"Why aren't you letting me in the restaurant?\"  He did not respond.  I asked him again, and I said,  \"There have been others entering the restaurant since I have been standing, why can't I enter?\"  As he moved, I continued to follow him.  Then, HE PUSHED MY ARM that was holding the phone and said: \"Get that out my face and stop recording me!\"  Once he pushed my arm, I asked for security to be called and continued to record him.  As I continued to record him and follow him around, he pushed my arm a second time, and this time he knocked my players card out my hands and my ticket voucher.  I repeated my request to call security.  Once security arrived, one of them went directly into the restaurant and spoke to the manager who assaulted me, and three others stood by me.  I continued to record as the security guards stood with me, and I informed them that the manager assaulted me twice and knocked my items on the floor.  None of the security guards responded to me. However, I was advised that the manager WHO LIED, told the police officer I choked him and that was the reason they called.  I said are you kidding me?!  The manager assaulted me and knocked my items out my hand!, I asked for security to be called! Lavo, it is not OK to racially profile!   It is not OK to push anyone!   It is not OK to LIE!  My daughter was awakened in the middle of the night and hauled off to Child Protective Services, was not told what happens to me and was not able to call me and did not speak to me for over 40 hours. She thought she was never going to see me again.  For what?!  Because the LAVO Manager on duty profiled and lied on me!  A great thing I have video!",

I would give them 5 stars, but the service was a bit off. We had 3 people stop at our table before our actual waitress did and the table location wasn't the greatest as we were sat next to a huge group that was congregating for some sort of a corporate function. With that said, the food came out promptly and as ordered. Another win for Lavo!",

Quite honestly, we chose this place based on rave reviews of their garlic bread (one of the birthday girls has an obsession).  The garlic bread was tasty, but I think what made it so great was the delicious marinara sauce we dipped it in!  The sauce was some of the best I have tasted.  We ordered a few of the 16 oz meatballs for appetizers and they were covered in the sauce as well - they didn't last more than 2 minutes on the table! One of our friends loved it so much he even ordered another one as part of his meal.  Highly recommend.   For dinner I ordered the filet mignon with truffle butter and it was fantastic.  The meat was cooked to perfection and the butter came on the side so you could use as much or as little as you'd like.  Each bite melted in my mouth - well worth it.  My boyfriend got the veal parmesan and it was massive.  Literally the size of the entire plate!  He devoured it all and said it was tender and delicious.  The only complaint from our group was the snapper, but other entrees included various pasta dishes and seafood Alfredo - all of which were thoroughly enjoyed.  Our waiter was also very nice and attentive.  He even brought over dessert for us at the end!",

The kumamoto oysters are great, the Meatball, the grilled octopus, and many others.  This is almost one of those places where you could order a bunch of appetizers and feel satisfied afterwards. Our waiter recommended the Cavatelli Bolognese and it was fantastic.  He also recommended the spaghetti and meatball but we ordered a meatball already. The house garlic bread is second to none, it's nicely seasoned and it comes with a marinara sauce on the side for dipping.  Don't forget the yelp check in for the Oreo Zeppole which is like a deep fried battered Oreo.  I'm not sure how bad the wait is if you just walk in, I've always made reservations through Open Table and I've never had any issues.   Can't wait to come back to Vegas to eat here again.",

We were asked if we wanted to sit outside instead of waiting (there was a high wind advisory in effect).  We waited at the bar until our table was ready.  We checked in twice with the host and both times he acted like he didn't remember us.  As the host you should remember a guest when they ask multiple times if their table is ready. Once we were seated, the candle was out at our table and we asked a member of the staff to light it.  Instead of just doing so he and another staff member started arguing right next to our table about who would light the candle based on who gets the tip for our table.  Appalling! Very petty behavior at an establishment such as Lavo. We were told roughly four times that our garlic bread was coming, finally we got tired of waiting and asked for it but it took almost 25-30 minutes for it to get there.  The bread was amazing though.  Finally our waiter came and took our order, but by this point we were already tired of the poor service.  As soon as the food landed on our table (I say landed because the person who dropped it off was in such a rush that it felt like the plates were just tossed on the table while walking by) our waitress asked how the food was so far.  I hadn't even grabbed my fork yet.  The food was really good though.  The pasta was amazing and the lobster my wife had was also really good.  Service was so horrible we didn't even want dessert though a few items did look very appetizing.  Very disappointing night for the amount spent.",

The place is beautiful with a bar/lounge area and lots of tables in the back. My friends and I started with the meatball with whipped ricotta ($24). It was amazing. Literally the best meatball I've ever had. The sauce was on point and tasted great with garlic bread. The meat melts in your mouth. To drink, I had the cocktail (meadows-$14). It was ok, a little to sweet for me and reminded me of a mojito. For my entree, I had the penne seafood alfredo ($33). I loved how light the sauce was and there were 3 large shrimp and a couple of cut up scallops. Overall, an excellent pasta dish without making you feel bloated. The service was also wonderful. I'll definitely be back for dinner!",

I honestly think that the price is worth it with how expensive mixed drinks are in Vegas. May as well get your own bottle and dance on the table after you're done eating!! It was crazy and the music was awesome. We can't stop talking about the experience and are so glad we did it!!",

The bolangegse was OK, thought that it would be better with the flavor of the meatball. The calamari was tender, but needed a little more flavor. Drinks are expensive, as they are everywhere in Vegas. Ambiance was nice, but it was busy. They had a DJ playing great music and made the enviroment fun and enjoyable. I really wanted a straw for my water and that took 4 people to get, but I won't knock them for that! Overall, great dinner at a moderately priced restaurant in the Palazzo.",

At the bar and then was seated. It was my Birthday so we wanted to relax, enjoy the view and pace the meal. After we initially told the waiter we wanted a few minutes to look over the apps he returned. When we told him we weren't ready to order he informed us we would have to move to the bar if weren't ordering food. Really? Whatever, we ordered apps and put it behind us. Fun doesn't stop there...he returned a few minutes later, prior to the apps arriving and asked for our entree order. We told him we weren't ready to order yet. Apps arrived, we finished them quickly as they they were tasty.   I went to the restroom and when I came back my wife told me she ordered (we already discussed what we were having). Apparently the manager came over with the server and told her if we didn't order entrees we would be moved to the bar. Seriously? if I would have known that happened I would have left. Never coming back. If you want the worst service ever...come to LAVO. Too bad as the food is good and I love the Venetian and many of their restaurants.",

    "text": "*** Review for Spring Restaurant week 2014 menu ***  What a great way to end Restaurant Week!  I had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the Terrace, the occupancy sign says).  The sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind Treasure Island.  It was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding Las Vegas weather.  I was seated a few seconds when my server, Casey, came and took my drink order.  My iced tea was delivered quickly.  A different server came to take my order.  There was no Restaurant Week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  After making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  Super garlic bread and very good marinara!  Back to ordering.  For course one, I went with crispy fried calamari.  It came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  The serving size was huge.  This would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  I sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but I could have finished the plate.  Lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!  I chose the penne alla vodka for course two.  It was a good sized serving and it was very good.  I slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.  For dessert, I opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  The top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a creme brulee.  There were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.  Service was excellent.  Casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  It was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing.",

    "text": "Too much money, to little value.  Firstly, full disclosure, I am a snob.  The positive first:  they have outside balcony seating which save the evening.  Temperature in April made al fresco dining a delight. We did not have a reservation but we were able to get outside seating with a 20 minute wait (Saturday night? might have been a clue).  Sadly, it went downhill from there.  The food was expensive and average or below.  The wine markup was 4.5x.  That may be normal for Vegas, I don't know.    For starters I had the beet salad, which was good, my wife had a mixed green salad with red wine vinegar which was so drenched in vinegar, it was a struggle to eat.    Half way through \"enjoying\" them (and certainly the fresh air), out comes the main courses!  No apology, no \"do you want me keep this warm inside\", they unceremoniously plopped it on the table.  They sat there while we finished our starters.  When finished, we switched the plates and began on our mains.  The empty plates sat there through our entire meal, and only cleared it when they came by to collect our mains.   I had a grilled fillet of Red Snapper that was filled with fish bones.  My bread dish was filled with bones.  The flavor was good, but certainly not great (certainly not worth $38). My wife had $34 spaghetti and meatball dish.  The meatballs were good (you could taste the flavorful sausage in it), and she reports the sauce  was good.  Again, really disappointing and not worth the money for average food, and below average service.  We don't recommend.",

WE started with the Margherita pizza than had the sea salt baked potato and baby asparagus. And for our main course i had the rigatoni sausage bolognese and the maine lobster and an order of the mixed wild mushroom. (i split the main course with someone else.) seemed like a lot of food even for me.   After dinner, We made our way to the second level which had a more of a club vibe, great tunes and they gave away free drink to the ladies from 11 to 1, i think. which was great for half our party.

The meatballs are still godly, and this would have been a good meal had the waitress not pissed me off.   She greeted our table and asked us if we would like sparkling or still water. But not like \"Would you care for some sparkling or still water?\"- you know- like it's optional. It was more like \"Would you like sparkling or still water?\"- like you have two choices...what kind would you like...the fancy kind, or the regular kind? I said \"Uhh...I guess  I'll have the still water. \" She brought over a bottle of water with the restaurant logo on it, which is common for complimentary water served at upscale restaurants, and poured us a couple glasses. I didn't think anything of it until a busboy came around a little later with a normal aluminum pitcher and asked us if we wanted refills on water. The waitress ran over and said \"Noooooooo!!!! They wanted still water!!!\" I then interjected and said, \"Wait a minute...did I just pay for  water? I'm sorry...I didn't realize I was being charged for \"still\" water. Jesus Christ, just give me the free water. Tap water. Whatever the fuck you call it.\"  So that pitcher of \"still\" water ended up costing $8.00 and the waitress didn't seem very remorseful about it. Look...I'm in Vegas. I obviously am prepared to pay ridiculous prices for drinks. But I'm not cool with paying for tap...oh sorry... \"still\" water. I'm not fooled by the fancy bottle with the Lavo logo on it. Come on. It's the same shit. Admit it. So I didn't like the deceptive upsell tactics. If you were more up front with me, Slim Shady, I would have left more than a 15% tip.  I probably won't come here again.",

The service was great, but to the point where it got kind of ridiculous...someone was checking up on us almost every 5 minutes during our meal so it felt like too many interruptions.    Our waiter recommended the meatball appetizer, which turned out to be pretty good...it was the size of a softball and good enough for 4 girls to share.  It was flavorful, but not spectacular.  We were hoping our entrees would turn out better, but things went downhill from there.  I had the seafood Alfredo, which was shrimps and scallops in a light cream Alfredo sauce.  It was so incredibly salty that I only finished a fourth of my plate.  My boyfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass.  The fish itself was well cooked, but it was lacking in flavor.  We also had an order to roasted potatoes with sweet caramelized onions, which was also salty.",

We were seated within 10 minutes and our waiter was very attentive, helpful, and friendly.   We ordered the kobe rice balls for an appetizer and they were nothing short of delicious. The rice was similar to a risotto. They weren't the japanese rice balls that I had in mind. Instead, they were fried and had marinara sauce, but still it was deeee-lish!  For our entrees my boyfriend had the chilean seabass and I had the chicken and mushroom ravioli. Both were perfect, the fish was extremely juicy and tender and the ravioli was flavored quite nice and the added arugula made for a nice accompaniment.  Overall, our meal was spectacular. The only slight and I mean SLIGHT downside is that the pricing is a little steep. But then again, you get what you pay for.",

Some notable dishes were the flatbread pizza with truffle oil, pistachios and carmelized onions, as well as the chilean sea bass, which was cooked perfectly.  Pop in for an early dinner for manageable music levels and to avoid the nightclub crowd.",

We had just suffered horribly from our experiences at TAO, and was trying to salvage the night, so we went here.  The club is chic, and I liked the decor very much. My only complaint would be the amount of stairs that I had to climb to get to the main club/dance floor, but that wasn't TOO bad. The music choices were good, and people were much friendlier than TAO. These all lifted my spirits. The floor was packed, but what would you expect on a Saturday night?  My gripes with the club would just be the space (the dance floor and club area is tiny), and the lack of dividers between VIP and everyone else. I think all clubs should take a page from PURE, and section off the VIP areas so not just anyone can go and sit in there, and so there would feel like there was a difference for ppl who pay for the extra space vs ppl who did not.",

The food was really yummy and the prices seemed reasonable for Vegas (maybe that's because I had just returned from living in over-priced SF for four months).  There were about 8 of us and most of us ordered various pastas.  One of my friends had the steak and she seemed to enjoy it.  Our waiter was really fun and he made sure my friend (who was having her bachelorette party) had a great time.  After a filling dinner, we headed upstairs to the club.  It's kind of weird that there are little faucets on the bridge part before you enter the club.  My hands were not that clean from dinner so I washed them there. Haha, I'm sure that's not why they put them their but that's ok.   My friends wanted to leave the club after 10 minutes but I was having a good time.  Oh well, maybe next time.  It was really small and extremely crowded.",

The perks of knowing peoples right?! I got scared in the beginning because this was all through phone calls and never physically meeting with the guy that HOOKED us up!!!!!   When we had said we had a table at the front door of LAVO, the bouncer was giving us a hard time. Kept looking over his clipboard, and talking through his earpiece the whole time....Then soon enough he unhooked that velvet rope and let us through escorting us to our FREE COMPLIMENTARY Bottle Service Area!!

I waited like 20 min for my table with reservations...  Anywho...I ordered the giant meatball with the cheese on it...the best meatball eva! It was so tasty, not dry, perfectly seasoned...my tastebuds are salivating just thinking about it lol. I wish they could ship me a meatball lol. I had it with some spaghetti. It was good, but adding the meatball made it taste awesome. They gave us some table bread with marinara. That kept is going while waiting for the food. Also they have a live dj inthe restaurant spinning beats. I was dancing at the table the whole time too which was pretty cool. Made the waiting for your meal not so bad while eating the bread.  I told them it was my birthday and they brought me a strawberry shortcake dessert! It was also very delicious. That was the best birthday dessert by far from all the restaurants I ate at. And it was free! Just make sure in your reservations you tell them you are celebrating your birthday and voila free awesome tasty dessert!  We went to the club afterwards...I suggest dining where you want to club as you get line cuts and don't have to wait and it's free.   After getting up there...lawd it was too crowded and people were pushing..we got the heck outta there and went somewhere else..oh well..no matter I just went to bed and the next morning had leftover meatball for breakfast lol",

    "text": "This is a review only for the nightclub.  We came on a Wednesday night and had arranged for the guest list ahead of time.  We got there around 10:30 and one of the promoters arranged for us to go in the restaurant and get free drinks before the club opened (essentially free bottle service, but there were a number of girls there already so we didn't get to sit).  Once the club opened, the promoter walked us into the club, got us free cover and open bar wristbands.  He even offered to arrange for us to get on the guest list for Tao the next day, but unfortunately we were leaving town then.  If I ended the review here, I'd still give this place 5 stars.  This club knows how to treat girls!  The decor is really beautiful, classier and cleaner looking than Pure (the only other Vegas club I have to compare with).  We got basic cocktails with our wristbands.  The ones I tried were really tasty, but expensive if you're not getting them for free (but really, what else can you expect?)  The bartender we went to was fast, attentive and very cute :D  There were a surprising number of places to sit down, unlike other places where you can only sit at tables you've reserved.  Nice when you're on your second night dancing in 4-inch heels.  It is True - the dance floor is small, but I found it way more fun than the one at Pure (which is huge).  The floor was packed almost immediately after the club opened up, which I really like.  I hate that awkward first hour when all the guys are too shy to go dance and the only people on the floor are couples and groups of girls.  The lighting is phenomenal and there's a chandelier that shoots out foam every once in a while.  I thought the music was good too - mostly Top 40s and Hip Hop, and well mixed in my opinion.      The only downside is that this place seemed to cool off at around 1:30 - 2am -- a little early for my taste.    I'm pretty sure this is the only major club in Vegas that's open 6 days int he week, so you don't really have an excuse not to go!",

Decor: Amazing, had the theme of Tao but \"newer\"  Service: Our cocktail waitress was very attentive; I like that kind of service, especially since she made 18% of our total bill, I really liked how she was always refilling things, lighting up our stogs, keep people away from our section and made sure the girls that were really drunk were getting taken care of.  We also got buy one get one, which I thought was nice cause even though the bottle are over priced and over-rated, you are paying for the service and the VIP treatment.  People: Mix crowd, no rowdiness like most areas; There were a group of NFL football players, which I thought was cool.   Bouncers: Our bouncer that monitored our booth/area was very attentive, he kept weirdo jerks away from the ladies.   Music: Something I have on my IPOD, jaminn' to all the time.   Overall, the service was great, music was something I have on my IPOD and I will be returning my next time around to Vegas.",

I didn't know that both were related seeing as each have a different ethnic menu. After attending TAO on a Thursday night, I expected LAVO to be just as magnificent.   Since we had our wristbands from the previous night, the security directed us to the shorter line and we were in within 5 minutes. Unlike TAO, LAVO had a much shorter line suggesting that we were dealing with a much smaller night club. When we entered we had to make our way to the top floor seeing as how the first floor was the restaurant and a single bar. When we arrived upstairs, the music was bumping loud and the dance floor packed. We struggled to make our way onto the dance floor, dancing for a small amount of time before becoming claustrophobic. The security guards essentially herd people like cattle from the entrance in hopes of keeping it clear to no avail.   We finally made our way to the bar which covered one whole area and from this single bar with no more than three bartenders, everyone purchased their drinks here. Again, they seemed overwhelmed and undermanned. There was no real place to sit on the too floor and it was just two crowded with my personal space being violated. Much less satisfying than TAO was. Seeing as how it was just too crowded and we needed to rest our feet, me and my girlfriend made our way to the lower level to find a seat. I ordered a Margarita which was great as we sat there and relaxed on the couch.  We noticed that LAVO close at 2AM that day as they did not allow my girl to come back after going outside to talk to her friends. I chugged my drink and left saddened by LAVO's short comings. If your within the LAVO (The Pallazo) area, you should check it out otherwise go to TAO for a much better experience that doesn't end at 2AM.",

    "text": "My favorite club in Las Vegas. I'm a local too, so perhaps that carries a bit more weight.  I'll have to respectfully disagree with the 1 star reviewers here. They just don't understand how an exclusive Las Vegas club works. I had the good fortune of going to a soft launch as well as opening night which was the most fabulous amalgamation of beautiful people I have yet to see in Las Vegas. What makes this club great is its intimacy. I'm not a huge fan of these supermarket-style clubs in Las Vegas. Lavo is a breath of fresh air. From my perspective, it's manageable. The club is on the second floor above the restaurant and you can actually see the entire room from the bar area or corresponding VIP area on the other side. Allows for greater connection with the crowd and understanding of everyone's geographic location.   Sound system is amazing. Service impeccable.  The guys and gals at the door are the best in the city. If you can't get in or they're telling you it's five grand for a table, it's because you're probably not dressed appropriately or they're going to sell that table for 5 grand to someone else if not you. This club is owned by the same folks at Tao - the most profitable restaurant in the country. Don't take offense or take it personally if the guy at the front desk tells you something astounding. He's telling you the truth. That's what makes this group so successful and that's what makes their service so exceptional.  And this place has exceptional service. Akin to Tao. So if you want a more intimate experience with a phenomenal sound system and a gorgeously appointed North-African style club...go to Lavo. And, unlike Tao, I recommend going here with or without a bottle table as you can easily get drinks at the bar and make a short walk to the dance floor with relative ease.  Ask for Lynn, a fabulous VIP host if you're with a group. Bonus: there's a hookah lounge outside the restaurant which is a great place to relax with a small group of friends and enjoy an amazing smoking experience with a highly knowledgeable group of guys who mix their own tobacco into gorgeous flavors and aromas.",

    "text": "This review is for LAVO as a nightclub.  The review is: it sucked.  It was tiny.  Very small dance floor.  main bar is tiny and takes forever to get a drink because of the stupid design around the bar.  It's basically a big bottle neck.  There are so many better places in vegas to go to.  When we got there, it was still before 11, which is really early for vegas.  The bouncer immediately asked if we were on the guest list.  We told him no and he told us that we weren't going to be able to get it. WTF?  it wasn't even 11 yet.  The place was empty.  The line was short, although i think they were trying to make it look like they had a line.  The bouncer said to talk to the main promoter, who basically said the same thing.  you can tell it was a very well rehearsed speech.  I asked if he was refusing to let us in, and he backpedaled.  he said 'let me see what i can do', like i should be grateful to the SOB.  When we got to the front of the line, they let us in, no problem.  Of course cuz they were hurting for business.  They needed our $30 cover.  While in line, i heard the bouncer and promoter run the same scam on other people in the line.  Either they wanted us to bribe them, or this is the slimy tactics this club uses to try to not be pathetically sad.  They can certainly chose to try this used car sales sleazy approach, but my group don't have to go back, can tell everybody about how much this club sucked when anyone asks about our trip, and write them unfavorable reviews wherever we can.  Hey!  That's what we did do.  Lavo, you suck.  Mainly because of your sleazy promoter and tactics, which is driving the types of customers you get...or are not getting.  this club will die soon and become something else.",

    "text": "AWFUL CLUB, terrible service, never met a dumber group of bouncers. Got kicked because the table next to us was being rowdy even though we spent upwards of 700$ on a bottle. Idiot manager couldn't even give us a reason for kicking us out other than \"someone in your group was misbehaving\" if you saw someone acting stupid in a club, would you kick out the people around them? no. club was DISGUSTING is it that expensive to hire janitors? Also I couldn't believe how prostitute invested the club was, I wasn't aware clubs hired prostitutes to up the ratio of guys to girls, super low if you ask me. Extremely unprofessional staff. Again i can hardly put into words how stupid the bouncers were, met this 17 year old at LAVO who used the jenkiest fake ID to get in and he said he didn't have a problem, him and 3 of his friends had no problem getting into a 21+ VEGAS NIGHTCLUB. I didn't feel like I was in vegas that night but maybe Atlantic city or some club in Fresno. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GO TO MARQUEE OR XS.   PS the DJ SUCKED, dj scratchy or scrappy? some lame dj from LA i could have found better talent on my list of facebook friends.",

Want to get cheaper shots, buy them through the female waitresses. they always walk around and u can get 2 shots for $12 instead of $13 for a shot if you buy it straight from the bar in there. during weekdays, you get in for free :)",

My coworker had the filet and said it was really good. We had sides of sauteed spinach and one other side I can't recall. Their long islands were strong but balanced. Our view was great but unfortunately they aren't doing the pirate shows across the street right now due to renovations or construction or something. But what a meal!!!",

We had gotten there really early, since we had free drink tickets, but when we got in the bar was so crowded it took us forever to get our drinks.  Plus, the drinks were much more diluted that I'd like... There were girl dancers laying around, dancing, fanning themselves with these feather fans, which was pretty cool, and the music was actually REALLY great to dance to and we ended up staying the whole night until closing.  The DJ played great hip/hop songs from way back when...like Hot in Here by Nelly, that just brought back memories of great high school days.  However, the venue is just too small, and I'd recommend going next door to Tao.",

The bartenders took freakin' forever and the bar was a bit of a messy area. The place isn't that big, but it was fun. Super crowded, and with weird funky birthday music playing every now and then. I did love the trip up and down the stairs with all of the running water. That was pretty amazing. Overall, it was a good experience and I enjoyed it. Better music could've been played however :)",

The boyfriend and I went here on our trip to Vegas this past March and I loved this place so much that he recently took me to the one in New York. I didn't love my food at the New York location as much as I loved my food at the Vegas one. Seriously, it was just that good. After our delicious dinner (accompanied with wine and dessert) we went to the lounge/club area upstairs. I remember it was a Thursday night and there weren't too many people at the club but I still had a great time. Lavo brings back so many wonderful food and dancing memories that I would recommend it to everyone going to Vegas.",

    "text": "This review is for 2 parts - the Day club/brunch and the Night club!  1) Day club brunch: My girls and I showed up for the day club (dancing only, no food) on St. Patty's day and was promptly whisked in. The biggest drawback is the layout of Lavo (the first floor at least). The majority of the space was taken up by diners (with amazing smelling food) and thus left almost no space to dance. My group of 8 found a small space underneath the dancer girl in bathtub (don't ask...she was hot though).   Music was solid (mostly house). Drinks were standard price ($14?) and the free green ish being passed around was an added plus. Green foam sticks, green glow sticks, green shamrock head gear - the works! We were next to the go-go dancers and we could not stop drooling at this one mixed Asian chick. She was weeeeeerking it! I'm in love.   2) Returned later that evening with our cute little Asian promoter. She walked us in, got us a table near the bar and a round of drinks! We started dancing on the couch before a bouncer stopped us ... and told us to dance on the ledge instead! There is a cushion on the couch that can be removed and the sweet waitresses told us to keep all our purses in there! So accommodating :') Music was mainly hip-hop, so definitely got back to my roots.   Lavo is a solid part of my Vegas club rotations :) Definitely check it out!",

    "text": "I came with my friends on one of their Industry Nights on a Tuesday.   My friend put us on the guest list and even the guys didn't have to pay cover! Yay! We got wristbands so we got free drinks/open bar from 11:30-12:30. Awesome! The bar was pretty crowded and crazy but the bartenders were amazingly fast! The guy we had was super nice and sweet too. Not rude/attitudey at all. Huge plus for that.   Overall ambience is nice. It's like a Mediterranean bathhouse type theme. A lot of people complain that their dance floor is really small and I admit, it is definitely on the dinkier side compared to other Vegas clubs... but it's similar to a lot of dance floors in LA. So I guess it's all relative.    Music was really good in the beginning - hip hop, top 40s, etc. but then towards the middle of the night, the DJ changed and it turned into house/trance music which I'm not a big fan of. They also gave out these huge long styrofoam glow sticks that look like pool floaties. LOL that was interesting...  Overall, I'd say LAVO is a good place to pre-party for the open bar but not a club I'd wanna stay at the entire night.",

    "text": "Really good food and service!  (This review is for the restaurant only.)  We rarely venture out of the Cosmo or Encore for food when in Vegas, but we had some friends staying at the Palazzo this go around so we decided to give a new restaurant a try.  We decided on LAVO due to its location and becuase it seemed to have a cool vibe.  Half of our party arrived fairly late, but the restaurant was very polite about it.  We hung out at the bar and watched the Hawks lose to the Bruins.  The bartender was nice and friendly as were the other patrons at the bar.  I didn't check out the bar too much as I was too caught up in the game so can't really comment on that portion of my visit.  The remainder of our party finally arrived and we were seated at a nice round table in the middle of the restaurant.  We had awesome views of the entire place...including the upstairs area which I assume is used for the nightclub (???).  Our waiter, Scott R., was super nice and funny...cracking jokes with us the whole night.  Our table ordered the meatball ricotta, calamari, mixed salad, carbonara, 8oz filet, 3 peas risotto, spaghetti with meatballs, wild mushrooms, and the 20 layer cake.  Everything was delicious!  The portions were huge so everyone kind of just shared everything.    We got the check and I and my husBAND decided to pick the bill up for the table to say thanks to our friends.  I am in charge of payments and tips in our house so when I looked at the bill and saw $354.20 for 6 people I was thinking we had gotten off cheap (that's like $59.00 per person WITH drinks and coffees, espressos, etc.).  We had a great time and thought Scott R. was awesome...so we left him an appropriate tip.  As we were leaving, Scott R.  came over and stopped my husBAND and told him that a 20% gratuity was included in the $354.20 total and that he did not have to leave an additional tip (I apparently missed that on the check...DOH!).  My husBAND was blown away by his honesty and decided to leave him a small portion of the additional tip we had intended on giving.  So...that means our check was even less that I had thought...great food at a decent price...in Vegas...what???  So, in summary...the food is good, service is amazing, servers are HONEST, and the food is decently priced.  We will definitely be returning to LAVO...perhaps to even check out the nightclub.",

There was a hiccup in the kitchen and we accidentally received more garlic bread - it comes with the meatballs - so we really benefitted from the kitchen's snafu! =)   The waiter was great. I am the type of person who always asks for recommendations for everything - appetizers, entrees, drinks, etc. He quickly noted this and recommended the sausage ragu and saggio cocktail. For entrees, we got the carbonara and the ravioli. To end - the oreo. Wonderful from start to finish.    It is on the noisy side but we expected that. We did not take advantage of this but dinner earns you entrance to the club.   Added bonus: if you don't finish your cocktail, they give you to go cups =)",

We have done a few group dinners and birthdays here and the food does not disappoint. The kobe meatballs are awesome and the various pasta dishes are all very good. Everyone in our group is usually very happy with what they ordered. Definitely a restaurant to check out if you are looking for a hip/trendy place, although it can get loud due to the crowd, lounge inside, and music.  The Nighclub - It's a lot smaller than most of the other mega clubs as it upstairs from the restaurant. Only one smaller dance floor and two elevated areas that houses the tables and main bar. I usually get bottle service here and it is definitely far less expensive than some of the other mega clubs in Las Vegas. It has its own unique smaller club vibe, but can be hit or miss in terms of the quality of the crowd. They do have good nights on Sunday and Tuesday (industry night) and the Friday/Saturday night is packed, but definitely not to the scale of the other mega clubs in Vegas.",

Our group walks up for our reservations after getting around the line it was not problem.  We walk in to dine we are seated at a nice table and can enjoy the view of the room.  I did no eat much because we did munch earlier so I really cannot review on the food. My friends seamed happy the setting in nice that time of the night if felt like more of a lounge then a restaurant but we were fine with that.  We moved upstairs to the nightclub after.  Tons of stairs kinda reminded me of what I would think it would be like to walk through the inside of an pyramid!  Maybe it was the little person with a large fan fanning the scantily clad woman we passed in one of the halls?!  Lavo\" means \"to bathe so the theme here is usually gogo dancers and lingerie clad beautiful women dancing or lounging in tubs.  The club itself is small the VIP and bottle service tables are nice.  Tip: If you come to Vegas and do a night club the only way to sit in any of the clubs in doing bottle service.  The price was comparable to other places, the table service/waitress was beautiful and took care of us all night.  All in all nice place but I left unimpressed just kind of ehh so 3 stars.  Good but not great.",

    "text": "LAVO tries really hard to be good at the three things it is: an upscale restaurant, a club, and a lounge.  It really excels at none, but is worth going to none-the-less if it's a slow night, especially if you're staying at Palazzo.  As for the food, get the Kobe (obviously not proper Kobe) stuffed rice balls and just be happy with those - they're absolutely phenomenal.  Go outside for a hookah on the balcony if it's nice enough out, then head upstairs for some shoulder to shoulder dancing on Vegas' smallest dance floor.  The VIP area behind the DJ booth is nice, but if you're able to get a table on the side of the floor, it's considerably better.  Drinks are weak and overpriced but you already knew that.  Music at the club ranges from crappy to okay ... I was never really wowed.  If you're a Palazzo Prestige cardholder, you get to skip the long line and if it's not jam packed, they'll wave your cover.",

The lobster ravioli was a little bit overrated because for $38 a plate you would think to be able to taste the lobster and the dungeness crab that was drizzled on top. The layer chocolate cake was huge, good for 4 people to share. It was very rich in flavor. Our waiter Casey was awesome. To drink I had the pomegranate lemonada it was to die for. I love the ambiance of the place.",

    "text": "Good food.  Good drinks.  And it's L.O.U.D.  Sure it's considered a nightclub, but we really weren't there during nightclub hours.  It was happy hour for us, so we stayed in the bar area were the seats were ample and spacious and despite it looking crowded from the outside doors, there definitely was more than enough room inside.  I mean, the space is HUGE....which I guess makes sense if this is also a nightclub.  Coming from New York, the prices were comparable, but generally, still pricey.  They offered a good slew of food items on the bar menu, which was great since one of us was a vegeterian (eggplant parm was yummay).  The drinks were great, though I did wish they had some kind of happy hour special.  Then again, this is Vegas so who am I kidding.  Like most bars/nighclubs, the ambience was dark and loud.  But for happy hour...I thought it was a bit too dark and too loud.  You definitely should not go hear if you intend to have any kind of conversation.  Well, maybe not inside the bar/restaurant space.  They apparently have some nice tables, couches outside that would probably be more conducive to conversing.  But it was a bit too cool that night (they do have heating lamps outside) and those areas were already taken.  Despite it's eardrum pounding noise, I definitely would go back with friends looking to drink and have a good time.  Maybe even dress up a little bit, as business casual attire didn't seem to cut it in this particular atmosphere.  I would even consider coming a bit earlier to check out the restaurant aspect as well.  You figure if the bar food was great, the actual entrees must be awesome.",

I dont know what the holdup was but it was very annoying and frustrating. Also, the crowd was not very poppin because I think there was an event going on and everyone happened to be in their 40s or 50s. Talk about bad timing. The music here is slightly less EDM than other Vegas clubs which I appreciated but I was definitely not feeling the crowd.   The only silver lining to going here was that my friends and I were dancing near someones table and they were super drunk and/or having a good time so they just started to make it rain with dolla billss. I think in total my group made $40-$50 from just going to the club haha. These experiences wont happen again so I will not be heading back to Lavo.  **TIPS** 1) From my one time going there, the crowd tends to be a lot older than XS or Marquee. 2) Enjoy!",

Well that was what the plan was til the cocktail waitress reccomended a few snacks they had on their menu.  Ok so I caved...I swear we were only getting drinks. I had these figs with amazing cheese in the middle just little gems of a treat a bit ackward to eat but the taste was sublime.  My husband upped the annity and got a lobster flatbread that was AMAZING. So now were full, well sort of, so we think we'll skip dinner but on our way out we stop to get reservations.  Alas it was not to be (trendy place better make reservations WAY in advance) but not to be put off we come back a few hours later, with our friends, and squeeze into the bar. Luckily we were offered the full menu because I found their tomato lobster bisque fra diablo.  I think we had other food too but after eating this soup who cares?  Seriously if you never eat another thing again you must, must, must have this soup.  Its smooth and just flavorful.  YOu taste the tomatoes as if you've just picked them from the garden its almost sweet enough to be a dessert, but in a good way not in a sugary way.  Then there is a hint of pepper when you bite into the glistening morsels of lobster.   I'm salavating just thinking about it now.  All joking aside I'd go to Las Vegas just for this soup.",

    "text": "My experience at LAVO is the epitome of how you just need to straight up talk to the people who work there in order to get hooked up (pass to the front of the line, table & bottle service, etc etc etc). My boyfriend asked one of the bouncers outside if there was someone we could talk to about possibly getting bottle service on Thursday night during Halloween weekend. So we ended up getting hooked up with a table and bottle of Skyy vodka for under $200 for 3 girls and 2 guys.   At first, we were pretty pissed off because we got seated downstairs where it was really quiet and all the action was upstairs. But after about 10-15 minutes of debating on whether to stay or leave, we luckily got moved to a table upstairs. It was Latin night so most of the music we heard was Latin-based with a little hip-hop set in between. And because it was Latin night and there was a costume contest that might have been televised on telemundo (not sure though), it felt like we were in Mexico for one night instead of feeling like we were in Vegas... imagine that.  Because the overall space upstairs is pretty small, it's difficult to navigate your way to the bathroom on the left side of the room when the place is crackin'. Also the tables (along with the spaces between the tables) are pretty small/narrow so you're bound to have spilled drinks when you yourselves are drunk + the people around you are drunk, too. You never know because the girl you're making fun of who happens to be dancing near the DJ booth might just be the same girl who hella stumbles and falls onto your table, spilling all your mixers and knocking them off the table.",

I'm sure the restaurant was beautiful too, but frankly I was so focused on the well-prepared and abundant food that I really didn't notice the decor.  We started off with some amazing garlic bread served with marinara--delicious!  And an amazing looking Kobe meatball (I don't eat meat) that easily was an appetizer for 4-6 people.  I had a terrific Heirloom Tomato Bufala Mozzarella salad with Fig Basalmic.  For my main course I decided on a carb fest and ordered a Spinach and Artichoke Pizza, with black olives and roasted garlic.  The pizza was about 5 inches wide by two feet long, could easily have served 2-3 people and lasted me well into breakfast the next day.  I also tasted their roasted chilean sea bass that was excellent as well.  The food was plentiful to be sure, but was prepared with style and finesse.  Lavo is on my list of restaurants not to miss when visiting vegas!",

Well \"chef\" had no right to not allow sides of pasta based upon how the rest of his food tasted. The chicken was overcooked to the point that it tasted burnt even under a layer of cheese. This wasn't even the worst part. The chicken parmesan was covered in so much garlic that not only could I not finish it, but it tasted more like garlic bread than the actual garlic bread did. Not impressed conisidering the amount of money I paid.",

We stopped by at about 10'ish. KC did his magic, and next thing you know GG and I had our IDs checked, got introduced to our personal hostess and we were seated at our table.   Half an hour goes by and the club starts to get packed. I wasn't even able to see the dance floor from our location. There was no way in hell they will give you a good location on comped tables. We were working 1/3 way down the Belvedere bottle. I m not sure what was going on, but GG was having some random convos with a group of grenades infront of our table. With the grenades was this hot looking posh spice look-a-like ( later found out that she even played soccer). I decided to rap with her. The conversation was flowing, and things were going great and next thing you know GG was like .. \"Look bro, Tryst is getting packed, we gotta get down there\". So we still had 2/3 of the bottle left, and KC decided to let the grenades have at it. I couldn't be a clinger on to Posh Spice. The girl was from Canada and didnt even have a phone on her. I had to old school it and slip her my # on a LAVO napkin. She thought I was her hero.   Either ways, we got out of LAVO alive and I didn't take any shrapnels from grenades like GG did.  GG has been voted as MVP at LAVO.   PS. I m going to skip the Tryst review. I have like 500 of those.",

    "text": "The short version is that this place is too snooty, even for Vegas. The  food at the restaurant is probably 75% miss, and the club is even more pretentious than the restaurant. Yelpers, watch as I disect how Lavo will thoroughly disappoint you.   The biggest thing I have to warn you about, whether you read the entire review or not, is that if you're eating at the restaurant, beware ordering sodas. This is the only restaurant with cloth napkins that doesn't do refills but rather charges you for each additional soda.   -----  So we go through a lavishly decorated restaurant. The ambience shows clearly that whomever was responsible for the design of this place went through a great deal of thought and effort in the creation of the experience. I went to the washroom to wash my hands, and there are these clay vase type things that are very big. You use your foot to push a pedal and the water comes down from a showerhead about 3 feet above you. The design looks cool, but practical application leaves much to be desired. Well, that's about all there is to be impressed with.   Service: They dropped our entrees in the kitchen. So we spent an extra 15 minutes waiting for everything. Not related to us directly, the server dropped an entire table's food on top of this one guy who was wearing a white shirt. I presume his jacket was on his chair so that probably was ruined too.   We order a myriad of things from the menu. There are, a bunch of us eating. I'll just go item by item.  1. Kobe beef sliders. Excellent. Why? It's kobe beef. But it's he size of TGIF sliders and it cost 28 bucks.  2. Margherita pizza. Flat bread with toppings. Nothing special. 22 bucks. 3. The striped bass, or some kind of whole fish. Oooh, awful. The fish was bland on the top, and when you got to the bottom it's as though all the seasoning settled on the bottom. I wish I had known all the flavor was at the bottom of the pan when I was eating my bland fish. Oh, and it's served in this iron pan, so you can't really cut into it with a knife and fork. It's like dishware from the middle ages where forks and knives weren't around.  4. Shrimp Scampi. Make sure you have a small appetite cuz you're going to get an appetizer sized portion. 5. Tuna Tartar. HAHAHA. Imagine a cracker the size of a half-dollar. Now put a small amount of tuna on top to cover the cracker. 4 pieces. 16 bucks. Thanks.  6. Salmon - Overdone and super lemony. When we asked the salmon be less cooked, they came back and gave us smaller pieces of salmon.   Suffice to say I was less than thrilled with our dinner. And our bill was about $500 because each soda was $4, and when 6 people each have 2-3 thinking that it's refills, we got overcharged by almost $60 at least in my opinion. Had someone explained that each soda was an additional $4, I don't think people would have ordered sodas.   So we pay the bill, and we then plan to go to the club. Okay, we just spent $500 at your crappy restaurant. Can we get comps into the club? Of course not. They were, however, nice enough to give us 2-for-1 admission for the girls on Wednesday night. Yeah, it was Thursday. Only because I asked, did we get our hands stamped which supposedly allowed us to jump to the front of the line. Yeah, they didn't.   We go into the club. It's standard. Nothing extraordinary. Except the kinda naked lady with the midget fanning her. Okay, that's the frikken ambience of the club? I asked to take a picture with the midget and he was more than happy to, but the jerk bouncer wouldn't let me actually stand next to him on the platform so in the photo you see the midget and my head next to his foot. Oh yeah, and the drinks are weak. I mean, they're strong if it's your first night in Vegas. But if you've got any kind of tolerance or have ever drank before in your life, be ready to drop another $100 or so in drinks.   Well, that's about all I have the stomach to write. Go if you've been to every other place in Vegas and you're going for that streak. But overall, you can totally skip over Oval. I mean, Lavo.",

A $325 dollar bottle can slip into your card as a $450 bottle (happened the second time) and you get 'admin fee' and compulsory gratuity (for bad service) ...ends up being $590. hmm...a little bit too much of a gross up to get away with it.   Music: good when there is a decent band.   Dance floor: super tiny ...you spend the time doing the 'move from people walking' dance all night...so not fun at all, at all!  Crowd: \"I'm so beautiful, I can just stand here coked up and look amazing, and inside me somewhere I think I am having fun..but I'll look neutral in face and not dance\". Please people...it's a club  - let go!  Summary.....Don't waste time here....hit Cielo, even Pacha when it is 21+ or anything in the MPD. Leave this one to the egos and people who don't care about what the ethics of 'billing' are.  If you do go because they have your fave act, drink beforehand or pay cash upfront for your bottle.   Terrible dishonest people. Theives even.   I'm sure upstairs is different, but leave the basement to the rats.",

Came with a big group and were quickly and efficiently taken care of. The only problem we had is that we were very surprised to see the extravagant cost we were charged for water. Maybe it was naivety from it being our first dinner out with a big group in Vegas, but seriously did not expect to pay $70 for water - if I had known, I would have asked for tap or stopped drinking it because they refill you as soon as you take a sip.",

I checked in with yelp and got the free oreo dessert which was out of this world...it came with a cup of ice cream(which was melted) with an oreo stuck on top and 6 deep fried oreos covered with batter, yum!  This is a must have so just check in to get it free. The caesar salad was delicious $19...big enough to share.  The halibut  ($38) was recommended and it was out of this world delicious!.  The seafood linguine ($38) was just ok, a little lemony for me.  The garlic bread came with a marinara dipping sauce, which I liked.  What I noticed was we didn't get the small condiment plate ( i think it had olives, etc).  Noticed other tables were served it.  We were finished with dinner and on our dessert when I noticed other tables with that dish, boo!  Other than that service was excellent,  waiter was very attentive and even the manager came by and asked how we were doing...I like that the managers actually care about their customers.    Can't wait to go back to try other items.  A great find in the Palazzo Hotel at Las Vegas.",

The main courses were equally superb and the group favorite was the rigatoni. Pictured is the dessert platter with tiramisu, cheesecake, fried oreos, and bread pudding. I'd never actually had a fried oreo before and they were to die for, especially with the mousse that they brought for the top. A lovely meal perfect for a special occasion.",

Unfortunately for my group, we were headed out to a concert after dinner, but we were ready to curl up and dream about the meal we just had because it was that good!   The restaurant is dimly lit and had fun music playing in the background.  This restaurant is legit Italian, but I don't think I ever heard Italian music which was a bit weird, but playful.  They bring freshly baked garlic bread and marinara sauce to the table once you've placed your order.  And, bless their hearts for having mocktails on the menu since I was prego - I could still join in on the fun with my girls!  I ordered their Penne Seafood Alfredo dish that was packed with jumbo shrimp, scallops, and lobster butter....uh yeah...melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  I started with their Lobster Bisque though which was like fireworks in my mouth.  So creamy!  We had so much fun here and were still talking about the food on the plane ride home.

    "text": "***EDIT: I was written an email by a manager, who offered a free dinner at one of their restaurants in Chicago. When I replied back and was told what restaurant I wanted to go to, I was ghosted and never heard back from them!!!! They tried to fix things, but again, goes to show you how well they care about their customers.   Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is for the food when it was finally right. Service was the worst I've ever experienced in Vegas. Restaurant was only half full, and it would of been faster to go out to the casino.. sit at a slot.. and get a drink. There was a specials menu put on the table... and when I ordered from it, they informed me they no longer serve the item. What a joke. Then, for a party of 7, everyone ordered and he ended up walking away not taking my order. Food came out and all the staff looked half baked while they were trying to figure out who ordered what, and then a item had to be sent back because it wasn't right. There was a manager walking around aimlessly the whole time and never once checked on us. Bottom line.. you're better off elsewhere. Food was good, but not worth the horrible service",

For an appetizer we had THE MEATBALL and it was super delicious.  How could we not order something called THE MEATBALL!  And I had the Chilean Sea Bass, which was so perfect with a crispy outside and tender inside.    And to top it all off they brought a Happy Birthday dessert with enough for all four of us to have a good portion.  Thanks LAVO!",

We went for a work dinner with 12 guests, they accepted our reservation but when we showed up to the restaurant it was then we were told a private party rented out the entire inside and if we wanted to eat it would be on the patio. It was about 50 degrees out so they had patio heaters everywhere but we were all still very cold. Deduct 2 stars for not letting us know in advance.   Food and wine was excellent. The meatball appetizer was freaking amazing... and HUGE! I was very impressed with this being cooked perfectly given the size! And the sauce was delicious as well. Main course I tried was carbonara which was prepared exceptionally well. The pasta was al dente and sauce was thick and rich! I was very happy with this meal.   Would go back but would make sure we could sit inside if it was cold.",

My steak dish was great, especially by adding butter, I'd only recommend that next time I'd get off the bone . And of course bread. I was a bit confused that every table also got a giant plate of calamari.. such a waste since you could see many didn't finish it, having already ordered the appetizers they wanted. They also have meal dinners where you can chose options for a less pricy full meal.",

There are other items included that are made to order, like the great eggs benedict.  We also added the meatball for a small additional charge, but at a huge discount to its usual price.  The bottomless drink options are a great deal too.  My only complaint is that our waitress was very slow to check on us.  She was out of sight most of our time there and hard to find.  We were able to sit out on the patio on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and relax and enjoy ourselves.  Save room for the desserts.  They all were amazing!",

    "text": "I have a very long-standing history eating at Lavo restaurant in New York, so I thought it was a safe bet to impress my client; I made a reservation a day early.   I must say that my experience eating at Lavo in Las Vegas was honestly the worst dining experience I've ever had in all the years of visiting Las Vegas.   Yes, it was that bad.   First, even though we showed up 10 mins early, we were asked to stand around and wait for 50 mins while other parties of same capacity were seated. Maybe we didn't fit the demographic they like to see as patrons? My clients felt unwelcome.  Literally as we were walking out to find a different restaurant, we were told they had a table for us... but, actually upon being lead toward the table area, we were asked to wait again another ~7-8 mins. It may seem like a short time, but after the 50 mins wait, hungry and embarrassed, those 8 mins were horrendous. We were told that they would \"comp some great appetizers since we had to wait so long\". So they admit poor treatment, and hope that comping an appetizer will make things better. Interesting.   Our waitress arrives another 10 mins later, we just want to eat. We order, the food arrives, my client does not like his food. He doesn't touch it. Our waitress didn't hear me call for her when walking past our table to address the food, so we all just shared our dinners and gave my client some off our plates.   It's concerning that when the waitress saw that my client didn't touch his food, she doesn't ask if everything was ok? Or if there was a problem, nothing. Second guy, asks if we need a box for it, \"no\", and also doesn't ask why on earth an entire entree is untouched.   This was the theme, the staff just didn't care at all. Literally the expression on their face was complete indifference.   This restaurant would not survive in New York, not in a million years.",

The place is huge and very classy. Our server was Josue and he was heaven sent. We told him we were on a staycation and he made it his life's goal to make sure our glasses didn't reach the bottom!  The meal starts off with water (bottled or tap) and a fresh basket of bread appetizers such as pretzels or croissants. As for the food, I ordered the steak and eggs with home fries as a side and my wife ordered the chicken and waffles. The steak was already pre-sliced which makes it so much easier to enjoy. Seriously, who wants to spend most of their meal cutting their steak ?  The chicken was breaded with captain crunch which is a nice difference from the norm. Our order was cooked to perfection while being nice and hot as it was served. We lucked out since the place wasn't busy at all so there was little room for error.  We didn't get to experience outside since it was so windy but we hope to next time!  Be sure to come by especially if you are staying at the Palazzo! I can't quite put my finger on it but there is something missing which is why I didn't give a Five star rating. Definitely want to see what their dinner service is looking like so we will be back!",

We started off with some wine (pics attached) and Tuna tartar! The wine was really good for the price! The tuna tartar was good but a little cold, which took away from the taste for me a bit. Usually, if it's at room temperature, it tastes a lot better! Well, finished with the appy's I got the Chicken parm. The weird thing was that the pasta had  to be ordered as a side but I wasn't really hungry and just decided to go with the Chicken parm and man o' man did I chose wisely! The chicken parm was the biggest I've ever had! It was HUGE! I have a picture of it on here somewhere and it was big!   Overall, LAVO was good! It isn't fine dining but the portion sizes are good and the staff was really friendly and great with us! It's a great place to grab a good dinner!",

The manager Pascual was very friendly as well, also charming and handsome for a guy his age! (I'm 22 he's not actually old just older than me lol). We had the meatball, the lobster, the chicken parm (all delicious) and when we finished our meal they brought us out complimentary desserts (the tiramisu and oreos- both delcious) which said \"happy anniversary\" in chocolate! Everything we had was so tasty but the portions were so big we had to take some of it home! We are headed home with our hearts happy and our tummies full. At LAVO you come for the atmosphere and the food but you stay for the staff that takes the time to make a great impression. We will definitely be returning.",

Go up to the host and let him know it'll be for two people he then asks if I have a reservation I responded with no and. He responded with a dirty look while rolling his eyes. I then proceeded to look to the side of him and the place was dead ! Maybe three others parties four at most. I was just thinking well this isn't a good start so he says it'll be a few minutes I was ready to leave at that moment but my gf was hungry and tired so I stayed. We were seated after a couple minutes after that moment I wasn't even hungry anymore but decided to have a small bite. The service was good but I can't speak if it's always like that cause like I said. Place was a ghost town all of not most servers were just standing around talking so it wasn't to hard to get service when needed. I just went for a Caesar salad nothing special about it tasted bland I've had better salad fro a bag. My gf went with the meatball and we shared a baked potato. The potato was cold the butter seemed like it just came outta the freezer. I didn't even it wanted anymore so my gf tried it with some bacon bites on it ( I don't eat pork ) they looked hard and over cooked and I was right that's exactly what she she told me it tasted like. As for her meatball (pork again ) she said it was okay nothing special just average. To sum it up this place is overhyped , unwelcoming and underwhelming I won't be back at all but hey don't let my review stop you.",

    "text": "We came across this restaurant thru Facebook. The only reason we really came here was for their 20 Layer chocolate peanut butter cake. My husband got the Chicken Marsala and I got the Chicken Parmagiano and we were not disappointed. Probably one of the dinners we've had in Las Vegas. We finally got to the dessert, we got the 20 layer cake and the Oreo Zeppole Dessert, and they are to DIE FOR!!!!!! Both had the most amazing taste my husband and i have ever had. If you're planing on dinning her I would highly suggest leaving room for dessert.",

The food was delicious and the garlic bread that comes at the start is everything.  All the portions were large and plenty big to have on your own or share a few. We used the yelp check in for the Oreo dessert and they were also great. There are a ton of Italian options in the Venetian/palazzo but we were able to get in here last minute and had an awesome time.",

I understand there's an expense for being in Las Vegas but not worth the price. The pasta was nothing special for the mixed seafood linguine. And the tuna was decent. Service was good at least. There was an obnoxiously loud table that arrived after we sat down and ordered. And the waiter accommodated our request to move to a different table. It was just a blah dining experience though nothing to hit home about when it comes to other places I have been for similar price.",

A month ago, I visited LAVO with my girlfriends as we were celebrating a bachelorette and I can't emphasis how much we enjoyed our time being there with the experience we had with them. We had reservations for brunch and once we saw our food and tasted it, we were amazed and in awe how delicious the food was!! After our brunch, I asked the server to grab us the dinner menu to help us decide where we wanted to dine. Seeing the menu, I was rest assured that LAVO would be the most ideal place to dine at. At dinner time, we were mind boggled with the yumminess of the food, servers, and the beautiful ambience. When asked, what we were celebrating, we were given a free round of champagne to enjoy with our Italian food. Cant complain to host the most perfect bachelorette with the most amazing food!!! When in Vegas, I definitely won't leave without having a meal at the LAVO!!!",

They didn't hold up the lines or anything, so even guys got in pretty quick. Alot of the ladies in line got open bar wristbands, so it's nice that they show love to the cute girls and the grenades here lol.   The venue itself is really nice, but really small! I do like the layout of it; with the bar being on a higher level then the dance floor. But if anything i would classify more as a lounge with a dancefloor rather then a nightclub.  Maybe because it was a Sunday? Don't think I would come here again unless I got the 3 in 1 wristband for Tao/Tao Beach/Lavo.  Really a 3 star rating, but an extra star for good music. The DJ played Sisqo's THONG SONG! hahah",

It's not like you can dance to the techno as you're eating. So what do you do during the dinner portion of the dinner? Stare awkwardly at your party because you can't really talk.   The food is fine, although a bit too salty, and expensive. But the atmosphere makes the place rather unbearable.",

Main dish went with Spaghetti Carbonara it was good but wasn't there to really grab me the only thing that really made me like it was the cream sauce and bacon.

The night club we went after we walked our dinner off and pre-partied with some friends. its nice and much better then 1 Oak but it was good. Music was well rounded and the DJ was good.

We came about 10 minutes after my 8:15 reservations , and they asked us if we wanted to be seated immediately outside or wait a few minutes inside for a table.  We sat outside on the hot night but luckily there was a breeze & got a view of Treasure Island's Sirens of the TI show.  The garlic bread wasn't bad and had a tomato dipping sauce.  I wish they would've refilled it, but the portions of our pasta dishes were huge, we didn't need refills of the bread & we took leftovers back to the hotel.  I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara which was so good!  It may have been the best Carbonara I've had.  And the cream sauce was light.  The bf had the spaghetti with Kobe meatballs which I had a taste of, and the meatballs were soft & yummy! My friend looked like she enjoyed her Rigatoni Melenzana, which was rigatoni in a tomato sauce with eggplant & mozzarella.  And ladies, you must order the refreshing fruity Lavolini, which is Prosecco with passion fruit syrup, & St. Germain Liqueur (made from Elderflowers)! The waiter also gave us complimentary Birthday Tiramisu!  OMG it was huge & deeeeelicous!  The best Tiramisu I've had in a long time!   We got our receipt from the waiter and showed it to the hostess for each of us to get a pass the line stamp.  Since it was still early we went back to our hotel room before clubbing it up upstairs at the club.  I'd definetely come back to eat at LAVO.  Restaurant: 4.    NIGHTCLUB: It was Lavo's 2 Year Anniversary so maybe that's also why is so packed last Friday night.  Or was it because Kim Kardashian & LMFAO were in the house?  Dance floor was tiny, Miss Kardashian's table took up a decent portion of the dance floor as well.  Music was decent however songs would switch up after only a minute or so of playing.  One of the girls that worked there had a clipboard asking for email addresses for the mailing list for a free drink ticket so my friend & I took advantage of that.  Thank goodness I kept my old teenybopper email addresses open & I put my Yelp name on the list.  The bars were packed however, and my friend ordered our two drinks, Rum & Pineapples, however, mine tasted so bad, it tasted like all rum and ice!   This is definitely Tao's younger sister...packed, hot, and got the girls in the bathtub/ottomans grinding up on each other.  Club: 3ish.   =Between a 3 & 4...but I'll round up because of the restaurant's food.",

    "text": "We went on the last day of restaurant week, which was $50 for each person. It's a 4-course meal including dessert, and we thought it looked decent so we booked a reservation. We walked right in, and people were already chowing their dinner or having drinks in the bar area.  As far as the decor, it's pretty much the usual \"dark\" Vegas decor. Since these are the same people who started Tao next door at Venetian, it's got about the same vibe. It was cool that the balcony outdoor area faces the Strip and a view of all the pyrotechnics from the TI Sirens show across the street.  On to the food. In a word to describe it all... heavy. 2 words? Very heavy. I know, this is Italian food, which is heavy, but this is Italian food on steroids. We had to request the restaurant week menu, and the waiter let it be known that the food portion sizes would be smaller than the usual. That was fine with us. But every dish that arrived was huge... either they just gave us normal portions, or I'd hate to imagine what even bigger portions looked like!  My wife and I both shared the calamari and kobe stuffed rice balls for appetizers, sea bass and seafood penne pasta for entrees, broccoli rabe and haricot vert (longer, skinnier green beans). Honestly, by the time we finished the apps, we were just about stuffed. The calamari were decent, thickly cut, crispy, and not too oily. I didn't taste much meat inside the rice balls, perhaps they skimped out on them.  The roasted sea bass was cooked very well, very moist, and drenched in butter. The penne seafood alfredo had some very good sized shrimp, but there wasn't much else. Maybe a few microscopic sized scallops, and I didn't even see any lobster meat. The haricot vert was very good, well-seasoned. The broccoli rabe, on the other hand, I just wasn't used to. Extremely bitter in flavor, I thought it would at least taste similar to Chinese style gai-lan. They couldn't be any more different, lesson learned.  By the time dessert rolled around, we just about had to unbuckle or belts and slip on sweat pants. They brought out a tiramisu dessert with a candle and Happy Birthday written on the plate, which I thought was a nice touch. Again, good dessert but very heavy. To top it all off, we also had a bread pudding dessert that we had to take to-go. Service was very good and friendly. We wouldn't come back again, but we had a good time nonetheless.",

    "text": "Came to brunch Saturday morning after finding a video on Instagram of how they do brunch, only to find out the \"party\" nightclub type brunch is only done in the winter, when pool parties are typically closed. Everything started off good, we had a reservation for 4 of us, we were sat quickly and right away asked for the endless mimosas. As we found out they are endless, we had tried 2 out of the 3 flavors when the champagne \"ran out\" according to our waiter. That was extremely disappointing, specially after we all see bottles of champagne being served to other guests. So as far as food goes, I do not recommend the chicken pesto panini. My sister ordered the french toast, and they were pretty delicious, tasted more like a dessert but still good. When we were ready to leave we ordered a cup of mimosas to go, since we had seen several guests walk out with LAVO plastic cups with drinks in them. To get those drinks took maybe 15-20 minutes, not to mention waiting for the check seemed like an eternity. The place was not packed but not empty by any means, but we felt abandoned at some time and that irritated us. I would come back just to experience the brunch I was expecting in the first place.",

My husband had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was breaded with a Captain Crunch breadcrumb mix. My daughter had the blueberry pancakes and was a huge portion. She hardly made a dent in it. It was loaded with blueberries on top and you really didn't even need the syrup. I had the chicken parmesiano and it was one of the best I've ever had. It was pounded thin enough to my liking as I don't really like the chicken to be too thick. Overall, this place was great and the food was delicious all around.",

    "text": "I think restaurant Lavo could best be described as the nightclub scene, but in restaurant form without the music.  It was crowded and instead of styled-up people hanging on the dance floor or bar, they were seated at tables.  On the plus side, if you are interested in going to the club later in the evening after dining at the restaurant, the hostess will stamp your receipt and that will work as a club pass.  My waiter first provided the table with garlic bread and a bowl of their red sauce.  He said they were known for this sauce.  I liked the garlic bread.  It was served hot, fresh and in foil.  Dipping it in the sauce was a good combo.  This is a good way to try their red sauce without having to order a dish that includes it.   For my entree, I had one of the specials of the night.  I don't recall the full name, but it was basically a risotto that had mushrooms and blueberries.  The risotto was creamy and mixed well with the mushrooms.  The blueberries added a different twist to the dish.  A good entree, but nothing life changing.    Bonus points to Lavo for having some good people watching during dinner.",

Free admission for guys & girls (even ratio) and free drinks for ladies from 11-12 (Wednesday night).  We were mainly the first ones in so we rushed upstairs to start happy hour.  Definitely had to do work to keep all of us double-fisting but after an hour and some change, we headed to the dance floor.  Oh, those shots were spectacular - like liquid candy!  (The ones they pass around)  Less one star only because this is small.  I always thought TAO was small, but this is tiny!  If last night was a Wednesday, how crazy packed does this place get during Fri/Sat?!  Bartenders did their best but one girl, oooooh, she really made us wait for ever and ever.  Would we have had 4/5 star worthy fun had fiance & I been with anyone else?  Probably not.  The Hidalgo cousin vibe definitely kept everyone's buzz level pretty high.",

    "text": "I think I've always had a negative attitude about Lavo because it is associated with being a night club and located in a Vegas casino.  Those two factors alone always seem to always bring my expectation of food down.  Lavo proved me wrong.  I was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of food AND service at our recent outing as a big bachelorette party group.  The Food: Garlic Bread (compliementary) - super garlicky and butter and perfectly crispy.  Just the way I like it  Meatball - They have a choice of meatballs and I thought that it would be a few meatballs, but this was one HUGE tasty meatball on a bed of fresh greens and flavorful garlic crostini  Tuna Tartare - refreshing mix of chopped tuna and avocado.  Not bad.  Kobe Stuffed Rice Balls - Aracini stuffed with kobe beef.  Interesting, yummy and filling.  New York Strip Steak - we ordered medium because we were sharing family style.  Actually cooked perfectly and delicious  Rigatoni Sausage Bolognese - The rigatoni itself was al dente.  Nothing impressive about the sauce.    Spinach and Artichoke Pizza - Soggy pizza.  Enough said.  Crispy Zucchini - Deep fried shoestring zucchini.  Yum!!  Garlic Mashed Potatoes - .... what garlic?  Service: Was it me or were all the servers handsome male models?  The service was actually really attentive.  Waters were filled, wine glasses never empty, napkins folded whenever we went off to the restroom.  Conclusion:  I would say that the restaurant offers a nice variety of crowd pleasers with some nice service and eye candy.  Overall, 3.5 stars because the food was a mix of mediocre to very good food.  Definitely not your momma's homemade Italian, but good for a fun night out on the strip and you can get a view of Treasure Island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window.",

However we were not on the guest list for that night. We talked to the bouncer guy and he told us to talk to the \"host\". The host was nice enough to get the ladies free drink wrist bands and comped for entry. The bar area was quite impressive. Circular bar so easy to wait for service. The bartenders were a little picky with the \"free drinks\" for ladies but that was okay. We were early so there was hardly any wait. I have to admit, I loved the music that night.

The music was a great mix the night we came. We loved the fun dance music, go go dancers and really nice bartenders. They served the drinks fast, and we barely had to wait, even for how crowded it was.   Its easy of course to get in if you don't have a guy in your group, with that said, they should have stopped letting people in at the point you couldn't move going up and down the stairs.

We ate at a nearby restaurant and we walked by Lavo, no line at 10:15. We come back at 10:45 (doors open at 11) and there were multiple lines, sigh. We end up in the VIP line that led us outside of the doors to stand in the freakin' cold. Pregaming early might have been a bad idea since this was on a Tuesday night. However, Sander Van Doorn was to be playing, so we did expect it to reach max capacity. The line barely moved and bouncers were no help. They even said the tickets wouldn't work since it was past 11! But after much discussion, we convinced them to let it slide anyway, at 12:30 when we were about to go in.  It's suuuuuuper crowded. Dance Floor way too small. Creepers everywhere. And I mean everywhere! Won't get into personal stories, but I must say, this was a sketchy ass club, and yall aren't even good looking. Yeah, people here were rude, stuck up, unnattractive, and were a waste of space.   Pros: -Decor is really cool. I wish I took photos because I was in awe. -Some good ass dj's come here. Mainly on Tuesdays, take advantage of it! Because weekends here are even worse and not worth the money. -Cool effects lights and the place is bumpin bumpin bumpin. -You can visit the restaurant, lounge, AND nightclub.   Cons: -Security is everywhere. Even on the dancefloor. Goddamn, get out of the way and stay on the sides or something. -Creepers. Creepers everywhere! Some old, most came solo, and all our obvious about being creepy as shit.  Why the 3 stars? Sander killed it! Such a good set, I kept wanting to dance. I wish I stayed til 4 but hey, shit happens. Overall, for a weekday clubbing night, it was chill. Who wouldn't love a 4+ hour set for free with sick visuals from some of your favorite dj's! =]",

Open bar for ladies, so we just went back and forth feeding drinks to our guy friends so that they won't be the sober party poopers.  Spent most of our time upstairs where the dance floor wasn't TOO big, but an alright size to get your shimmy on. Music was pretty good since I kind of remember dancing for a long time lol.  Not a bad place to stop by if you're planning on bouncing around to a few other clubs that night but not too sure if you want to stay for the WHOLE night, unless you spot a PFBD (potential future baby daddy)",

We got sat right away, were greeted by our server ( who btw not only was awesome but very handsome) . They are also dressed very nice with suspenders. The coffee there was great. And i' m super picky as I drink coffee everywhere I go. Brunch was also awesome, they served us different breads-pastries while we waited for our meal which was delicious to say the least. Everyone there was super nice and even stopped to converse with us. I would definitely go back again. 5 stars on my list.",

A power 106 dj was spinning when we went. Usually it's a girl spinning. They are all very good!!!   The tables here are super cool. You can put ur purses and jackets in a drawer hidden behind the table so no one can steal it. Love that!!  You can go up on the ledge behind the table to dance too. Super fun!!  There is always a waitress standing around to serve you the drinks. They also dance very good and entertain you.   The only problem is that the place is kinda small, so even if you have a table and there's rope around, it is overly crowded.",

The decor was modern and inviting. What we loved the most were the very attractive waiters, like everyone who was part of the waitstaff was very attractive, but not in a model or fake way. The food was good. Get one of the meatballs, but be prepared to share, as the serving size was huge. The service was great and our waiter even asked if we were going to the nightclub after and provided passes to get in. We had already put ourselves on the guest list earlier, but it's good to know for the next visit.  The nightclub was fun too. It had 30 something crowd and was smaller than other Vegas nightclubs, but not too crowded. The music was great too!",

The atmoshpere is beautiful and compliments the great service.The freindly staff is  not smothering  or rude. The utensils are super clean, no  dried water drops.

    "text": "I stayed at the Palazzo this past weekend with a group of friends of 4 guys and 3 girls.  With that kind of ratio, it's a b*tch to get into any club.  One plan after another fell through which is how we ended up at LAVO at 11:45PM.  Short line in comparison to TAO and no guestlist needed since we were staying at the hotel.  Free for girls, $15 for guys, which you really can't get any cheaper than that on the Strip on a Saturday night IMO.  I very much enjoyed the music and the scene is definitely not as pretentious as the major nightclubs which is probably why I liked it.  However, no matter how much I enjoyed the music, I HATED how crowded it was.  So crowded that by 1AM, I got stuck in the middle of the dance floor trying to get out and a tall (quite handsome) man had to pick me and place me at the bar because I was freaking out and no one else was caring that a 4'10 little girl was about to get stampeded on.  That's what you get when you're being a cheapass on the Vegas strip I guess.  I really did like the music a lot though.  A lot of hip-hop, R&B, top 40s, mixed in with some 90s rock, and some house.  A good mix.  House has taken over Vegas and it's not my cup of tea when I'm in a short dress and heels.  Just a shame that I had to play babysitter that night.  And that I almost got trampled.  Would I come back?  Maaaaybe.  Yelp 365 challenge #5",

    "text": "One of my most favorite places to eat & pourty while in Vegas!  I went here last weekend with some gal pals and once again, such a delightful experience.  The food is soo delicious.  I tried to warn my friends that we would get full real fast, but they were starving and excited to eat.  First off, I am not a marinara fan, but the marinara sauce they bring out w/ the garlic bread is definitely the best I've ever had.  It is a great dipping sauce to an even more awesome garlic bread.  For appetizers we got some calamari, and a kobe meatball on top of a arugula salad and crostini.  After this, we were already so pleased, satisfied, and pretty much full, yet we went forward w/ our entrees.  I got the special ravioli of the night, filled with ricotta cheese, soo good.  The other gals got the shrimp scampi and seafood alfredo.  Both were also winners.    After we stuffed our face til we just couldn't stuff it no more, we changed into our flats (it's Vegas... heels in the club can only last you so long, and you don't want to walk barefoot on those streets either!) and went to the LAVO lounge/club portion.  Luckily, we were staying at the Palazzo, so we were able to bypass the long line and get in para gratis.  The upstairs club  is pretty small, compared to the other ones on the strip, but it was still on and crackin'.  We danced a little, then went back downstairs to the lounge and kicked it outside and danced.  The outside patio is perfect cuz it is right on the strip, and you can watch the Sirens show at TI.  It also helps that the weather was about 101 degrees, so it was a beautiful night.  So, we danced the night away outside, inside, upstairs etc.  Great selection of music both upstairs and downstairs.   LAVO is just fabulous! Great food, great service, great music, and possible celebrity sightings... (last time I saw Robin Leach & a playboy bunny).  Definitely a must every time I am in Vegas.",

They also give you neon glasses, glow sticks, sweat band, and foam glow sticks! Definitely a hipster/raver party haha. They do have an outdoor area for you to smoke. Weird to come out to see the sun and then walking back into the club with glow sticks everywhere. Haha only in vegas. The Dj was pretty good, played mostly electro songs. Their go go dancers are pretty hot too, especially the asian girl. ;)  Overall, I would definitely come back here. B)",

    "text": "ONE BAD THING TO NOTE ON LARGE GROUPS: When reserving a large table, they make you fax over a form (that they e-mail you) on which you're required to include not only credit card info but also a copy of your driver's license, to hold the reservation.  Now I'm not saying Lavo is definitely responsible for what ultimately happened (because I have no actual proof of it aside from circumstantial evidence), but when I returned from my Vegas trip, I found out that someone went on a shopping spree (in & around Vegas) with the credit card # I had written on the reservation form.  Through process of elimination, I figured out it might have been someone who works @Lavo behind the scenes, who happened to have access to the fax I had sent over, w/my credit card info on it.  My credit card # wasn't exposed anywhere else on my trip except Lavo when I made the reservation (my party didn't use my card to pay for our bill, we all paid in cash - & I didn't use this card anywhere else on my trip).  This idiot also bought herself a plane ticket with said credit card. She doesn't realize that because of this, her name was on my credit card statement & I now have a name to add to my Kill Bill Hitlist. I called Lavo to ask if this person works there & they said they're not allowed to reveal any personnel info.  I still think it's a great restaurant, the food was absolutely delicious & service was very good. So I downgraded my original review by 1 star due to this credit card fraud thing. Would've only given it 1 star but I actually would like to go back here (because the food was that good) - & pay in cash!",

It is decorated in a French 1920s bisto type of very elegant way.  First the service was top notch as is the drink menu.  The menu is varied with pizza, steaks, pasta and main dishes.  Their signature app is their kobe meatball.  I dont eat meat, but when in Rome....The meat was fantatstic as was the richness of the sauce  For the main, I had the pasta, which was fresh with a very good red sauce.  Italian restaurants should have a good red sauce.  My colleagues had assorted pork, sea bass and steak dishes and enjoyed them thoroughly(then again I was buying)  For dessert, I was urged to order the Oreo(waitress was awesome, forgot her name, but she just turned 30)  The oreo is underneath a beinet, a french donut...I went to school in New Orleans, where these little hunks of fried wonder originate...great choice, great meal",

Tip..if the little area by the smaller bar/elevators is free, take over it as your own little VIP area and skip the bottle service.  The restaurant is a solid 3 stars. The food is pretty average italian food, but with a meal you get free entry into the club and get to skip the line. The service was good, but our waiter just seemed to brag about all of the celebrities that he's met and how much those celebrities like to spend on drinks. It was kind of cool to hear that kim kardashian and the kid from jerry maguire were there that night, but hearing him go on and on...kind of got old..fast..",

Just ask nicely. - We arrived about 12:30 am and since there was no line we went straight in. $20/man, or $10/man with the club pass.   - Lavo club had a typical ratio, I'd say about 60% guys, 40% gals, and average age of 30 or so (whereas Tao crowd skews younger, average of age 25 or so).   - Bouncers and bartender were all cool.  Cocktails are $13/ea. - Compared to the megaclub Tao, it was easier to dance in Lavo since it wasn't crowded, it was easy to find seats in the bar area (no bottle service required) and a more mature crowd.  I would have liked to stay at Lavo but my friends wanted to go to Tao so we moved on.",

    "text": "Review is only for the nightclub.  I have never had a bigger \"Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde\" experience out there.  I had read reviews that said that this club (along with the Bank and Vanity) were the best clubs to go to on a Sunday night.  We had gotten the $50 wristbands that gave us unlimited access to Tao and Lavo for the weekend, and despite getting a free pass to Pure at Caesar's Palace, decided to check this place out instead.  We got there at 10:30, only to be told that the club didn't open until 11.  By the time we returned about an hour later, the place was absolutely packed, which isn't a great thing because unlike many other clubs in Vegas, this one was quite small.  I suppose that's the difference between a \"megaclub\" like Tao, Pure, Tryst, etc. and an \"intimate nightclub\" like Lavo (and apparently, Surrender).  Anyway, the talent was absolutely lacking when we first entered, and the ones who did show up were, let's just say not that fun.  It actually got so bad that we left at around 12:30.  Of course, after walking through the Palazzo and doing a bit of gambling for awhile, we realized that it was 1:30AM in Vegas on a Sunday night, and decided to give Lavo one more (last) try.  These are things that you would never do except in Vegas.  Completely different experience, and it suddenly became a great night (or a regular night in Vegas, by my experience).  The place was still packed, but moving around didn't feel as difficult anymore.  Most of the snooty girls had left (or passed out in the bathroom, I hope).  And of course, as soon as we walked in, All of the Lights came on, with the accompanying light show and everything was good again.  Still, can't give this place a glowing review because before it was good, it sucked, badly.  And yes, even when it was good, it wasn't awesome, because some of the residual lameness from before was still there.  If nothing else, Lavo certainly proves more than anything that, \"in this town, your luck can change just that quickly.\"",

Aside from Lavo, we also went to Rain, Ghost Bar, and Playboy club, Lavo was the best of all these clubs. The layout of Rain is much better than Lavo, as Lavo is very small and a bit cramped. Regardless, the atmosphere at Lavo is pretty awesome. The small layout actually makes for a more intimate club setting. The decor is reminiscent of a dungeon in a way because of all the antique looking chandeliers - not that it was a bad thing.   There is only one bar so naturally it takes a while to get a drink. The drinks were good and relatively inexpensive by Vegas standards. For example I ordered a kamikaze which used aboslut vodka for $8.00. The best part of Lavo though is definitely the music. The DJ that night was an Asian guy (didn't catch his name) but he was really good. They play your typical tops 40's music, with some hip-hop classics and then nice dosages of house/trance remixes. I wish I remembered his name because the DJ truly made the club.   I'm not sure how much the cover is because we got in for free via a promo through the Venetian hotel. Either way though, you won't be disappointed.",

This time it was for my co-worker/friend Nicole's 22nd birthday. We received a comp dinner and free admission into the club.....ahhhh...the pluses to being a girl in this town. The food was delightful....fancy bar food...which I adore. The calamari and the flatbread pizza were the highlights. We also received a comp cocktail tree full of shots...it tasted like baybreezes and a cocktail (I had the Pompeii...Bacardi o, pineapple, grenadine and I think Malibu was in there as well...very tasty) . Our server was lovely and fun to chat with...plus his glasses were cool.  We roll into the club and we had to wait for about 5 minutes because we had some guys in our group. The bouncers looked visibly stressed (I guess the IBM convention guys didn't know how to behave at a nightclub). One bouncer was a bit rude to my friend because he didn't have a sport coat on...but he was one of the hottest guys there...again go figure. When we get inside and it was like a computer geek sausage fest. Needless to say it wasn't the ideal crowd (some serial killer looking dude was trying to freak on the birthday girl).   Overall it was a fun experience. The food was tasty, the service was great and the music was fun....just remember to steer clear when the IBM convention is in town.",

    "text": "I actually went to Lavo, located inside the Palazzo, by myself. I did not dress up. I wore jeans, a tee, and a hat. I was the only girl not in a bubble dress. If one dressed as a gangster or gun moll they could drink from an open bar open till 12am. The club opens at 11pm, so you'd get an hour of free drinks if you were first in line. I saw not one person in line dressed up for the theme except employees. I do not know what gangsters and gun molls from the 1920's have to do with bombshells and Burlesque. Someone at Lavo marketing didn't do their research, mixing the 1920's with the 1940's and 1950's doesn't really make much sense. I think I was the only one there that noticed it though.   The night's entertainment was to be The Cheeky LaLa's. I feel like I'm pretty aware of most Burlesque performers and troupes but, I had not heard of The Cheeky La La's before. So I did a Google search and couldn't find a thing on the troupe before I went to Lavo.   The DJ for the night did not play theme appropriate music, it was then same old hip-hop and house they play at every other club. I made my way to the bar to get a beer. They were serving \"Burlesque cocktails\" for their themed drinks and for the open bar. The two cocktails were 'Blood and Sand' and 'Clover Club'. I get naming a drink 'Clover Club' on Burlesque night, but 'Blood and Sand'?   The bartender was great and super friendly. He asked my name and remembered it the whole night. I told him I was there to write about the night's event and The Cheeky La La's for The Las Vegas Burlesque Blog. I was kind of uncomfortable, being that I was there alone and in jeans and a tee, and felt I had to explain myself. He bought me my beer, he must of thought I was a real writer. He shared with me the Cheeky La La's were to hit the stage around 1230 or 1.   For the hour and a half I stood around waiting to see The Cheeky La La's perform I took in the whole club and watched. I saw some pretty amusing stuff. Every time a party that had bottle service ordered a bottle of champagne, in addition to their bottle service, the music would change, lights were flashed, and the bottle was delivered to the table in some amusing manner. I saw Superman, held up by security to give the illusion of flying, present a bottle. I watched a lot of ass grabbing and dirty dancing on the dance floor. The club had go-go dancers on boxes raised up from the dance floor. I've go-goed for events before, but not like these girls go-goed. These dancers popped and clapped their \"booties\", and most of them were chewing gum.",

If you were on the dance floor you couldn't even move, much less dance.  We danced in the VIP area for a little while, the bouncers didn't really care and it was less crowded there.  We went solely because I heard they played good music (top 40 mixed with some 90's) but maybe we went on the wrong night.  Don't remember what songs they played but do remember countless shout outs to various people celebrating various things.  Really?  Play some freakin' music and shut up!  Will not be back.",

It has dim-lighting and it's romantic. It was pretty empty so the ambiance was lacking a bit, but our table made for it. They served us family style: rigatoni, chicken parm, pizza, salad, truffle fries, and calamari.  I must say, most of it was pretty bomb, except the pizza. I thought the crust was super soggy.  I also did not like the salad - too much onion/shallot and orange slices were a weird addition. I loved the tomato cream sauce on the rigatoni, but my favorite dish was the calamari.  It had just a tiny kick of spice to it, but it was SOOO good.  Probably some of the best calamari I've ever had.   The service was great.  The food took a bit, but they were always quick to refill waters and get us anything we needed.  I'd go back if we were going up to the club one night.  Overall, a good dining experience.",

    "text": "The service here was awesome.  Our waiter, a transplant from NYC whom we affectionately called Suspenders due to his uniform, was above reproach.  He was funny, personable and patient with our large group of girls out for a night on the town. He cracked jokes with us and showed us pictures of his young son.  Also, he wasn't bad to look at.  The ambiance was of the trendy lounge-cum-restaurant variety.  The same cookie cutter recipe seen over and over in most cities. Think exposed brick, low lighting, brushed cement floors and ambient music heavy on the bass and low on vocals.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing to write home about either.  I could walk right now to about 50 places that fit that description.  The food?  Underwhelming.  To say the very least.  I ordered the gnocchi and was warned prior that it was made of semolina, so I should expect it to be denser than what I may be accustomed to. That may have been the only interesting thing about the dish.  The truffle cream was simply adequate, the rabbit ragu was meh and the whole thing came out tepid.  It seems that whomever was doing the timing back in the kitchen should have waited for the Chicken Dominic that my fellow diners ordered to be nearly done before putting my dish up in the window.  The assessments from the other people in my party (of 7) mirrored my own.  The Chicken Parmesan was 'okay', the Chicken Dominic came off as 'something I could make better myself' and the Chicken Marsala was actually deemed 'worse than the Marsala I made at home last week'.  There was one bright spot in the group: the Lobster Scampi Pizza, which my friend ate up with delight.  Overall, I can't say it was the worst place I've ever eaten.  But it was forgettable.  And a little disappointing.  Perhaps a little more spice, a little more flavor and some better timing in the kitchen LAVO could elevate itself to 4 stars.  But I just don't see that it will ever have the legs to climb the rungs all the way to the top.",

Has the potential to get crowded quickly.  Started off with the Meatball with whipped ricotta. Ive definitely had better Kobe meat balls (Sorellina in Boston). If I eat there again, I will not order the meat ball. I had Chilean Sea Bass and it was a very good dish with very bright flavors and cooked perfectly. Our server was excellent. I believe his name was Arthur.   This is not my favorite place in Vegas but it was an overall good experience.   My biggest gripe was how much hell the staff gives you about going up to the night club after you've paid Vegas prices to eat there. The bouncers are the worst, unnecessarily rude and on some stupid power trip.  Once in the club, we found a good spot right at the bar, closest to the dance floor.  this is a very small club, but they were playing awesome music.",

It was a little windy so we had the terrace to ourselves on Fathers Day evening dinner. The waiter was friendly. My wife ordered the Lobster. I ordered a Caprice Salad. We were excited for our dinners untilled they showed up. The Lobster was super small. There was barely any meat on it. Extremely disappointing. My salad was a plate was full of delicious lettuce with a few pieces of very hard bacon bites. They gave me a couple of tomatoes. The garlic bread that's usually is very tasty with red sauce to dip in was horrible. The garlic bread was cold and chewy. The only thing that was still tasty was the red dipping sauce. We were very disappointed eating here. The waiter could feel our disappointment but could do nothing since he did not cook the food. It wasn't his fault it was terrible. The Ambience is beautiful and service is great.",

To be honest, we expected an over the top party brunch, but it was nothing like that (which ultimately, turned out to be EVEN BETTER!).  We sat outside on the balcony since the weather was perfect and had a wonderful experience from start to finish.  The hostess who sat us was the sweetest, engaging in small talk that really showed she enjoyed her job.  Our server Michelle became part of our group - so attentive and she kept refilling our bottomless mimosas -unlike other places that doesn't make Bottomless worthwhile.  And to make it even better - they serve Prosecco, not some cheap champagne.  The food was INCREDIBLE!  Our favorite was the parma pizza.  Perfect to share.  Overall a really beautiful afternoon on a killer balcony overlooking the strip.  We felt very well taken care of from start to finish.  Very much recommend Lavo.",

    "text": "Review is for the NIGHTCLUB portion only:  Located inside the Venetian and run by the same people as Tao, it's a restaurant that turns into a nightclub venue after hours.  However, the bar and dance area seem to be separate from the main dining area below.  To get to the bar/dance area, you have to go up some stairs, cross a catwalk with a bunch of running sinks, and then up some more stairs.  Odd right?  In any case, it's a decent venue but fairly modest in size.  There's a fairly large triangular shape bar with a bunch of tables lining the wall on one side for those that get table service.  They have a dance floor on the other side of the room that got really packed as the night went on, along with some additional tables around that and the VIP area on one side.  There's also a second, small bar by the dance floor, but I'm not sure if they are stocked like the main bar.  Maybe it's because LeBron James was in the house the Friday night we went, but this place was just INSANELY PACKED.  At it's peak, we were basically stuck standing in the same place as it was just too crowded around us for us to seek shelter somewhere.  Fortunately for us, our spot was right at the counter of the bar, so easy access to drinks while we stood there.  And stood.  And.....stood.  I have no idea if there was anything else beyond the triangle bar, dance floor, and table section since it was just too hard to move, but it didn't seem like there was.  The staff is very mixed.  The bartenders were all really nice and the one we bought all of our drinks from (by default) was really friendly with us.  She seemed to be relatively generous with her pours so that was a nice plus.  The security and hostesses on the other hand, were a few pegs below the bartenders.  Granted, it was crowded, hot, and kind of loud, and all of these buzzed people were a little slow in reacting to them waving flashlights in the air to get people to move.  But really, literally pushing people out of the way is largely unnecessary.  I mean, it's not like they were leading LeBron himself to a table...just jamming their way through to clear the area for people who are still making their way upstairs.  If they wished it wasn't so crowded (I certainly felt that way)...then maybe they shouldn't have let so many damn people inside!  Although we ultimately didn't need them, my friend and I were chatting with the cab driver on the way to Lavo and he was nice enough to give us some drink coupons and discount passes on cover.  Definitely helps to talk to your cab driver if you can, though you can get some passes at concierge too if you are staying at the hotel.  And for the ladies, you may want to try to come early if you can.  We ended up making it to Lavo by about 10:30 or so after dinner, and the girls scored free drinks until 11:00 I believe.  Thankfully, they were kind enough to pass along some drinks to us guys as well.",

I must confess that my Italian Great-Grandmother's recipe is better, but I did enjoy having them in a restaurant.    For my entree I selected the ravioli.  It was stuffed with cheese and so much better than what you purchase in the grocery store.  The filling was a little salty for my taste, but it could have been the cheese since some varieties can be a little on the salty side.  Other than that, they were good.  Our server was as sweet as she could be and gave good recs as far as what to order.  I always appreciate that info.  I would have loved to have ordered dessert, but I was waaaay to full to indulge.

The Lobster in the eggs Benedict was chewy, rubbery and just tasteless. The hollandaise, the English muffins and the eggs were not bad.  The Lobster in the Salad Louie was much the same.  My son tells me that the oysters were very good.  Now to the service. Our server was friendly and amiable. But fairly uninformed. Had to think about what khan no of oysters were on the menu. Then could not tell us which oysters were which on the platter. His attention was mostly directed to the table next to us whose 4 occupants had ordered the bottomless mimosas. We on the other hand had stayed just with water.  To his credit and to the manager's, they comped the Lobster Benedict. Good recovery.  In short this was a disappointing experience.",

Just stick out party in the corner and don't even make an effort to accommodate the situation, beyond ridiculous.  I don't care how good the food is, never been treated worse at a supposed high end establishment in my life, -5 stars  -Edit to say our waiter did a very good job and the food was tasty, unfortunate that the manager led to the 1 star",

Maybe it was bad luck or an off night, but the chicken parmigiano dinners we both ordered were both so mediocre, we both stopped trying to eat them half way through. They were surprisingly gristly, especially for that kind of money. What really turned us off is that the manager refused to adjust the bill, as though the experience was somehow our fault. My default before resorting to Yelp is to contact the restaurant's customer service, but after a month they haven't bothered to respond. I hope you have better luck than we did.",

    "text": "Well Lavo what can I say. I have loved this restaurant for many years, we always come here for dinner when we are in town, and probably have been here over 20 times. The past few times we noticed that the service and food have slowly been going down. When we ate there this weekend it was horrible and the last time we will be coming back. Our waitress had an attitude from the moment she walked over to our table, she was not friendly and every time we asked for something she acted like it was a hassle and most of the time just didn't return back. We asked for a drink refill and after 15 min she still hadn't come back, we asked her again, she mumbled some stuff and walked off. After a 40 min wait for dinner, neither steaks were cooked correctly, our waitress never returned back to ask how our dinner was and if everything was ok. We asked the bus boy for an extra plate, he never came back out, so we used a dish that one of our sides was sitting on. So for over a $600 diner I would expect great tasing food prepared how it was order, a waitress that checked to see how everything was and a pleasant attitude. So sad about this place and our experience.",

Margherita - flatbread pizza with basically no basil and too much cheese.  It's for 2 people around 10 slices. Very crisp.   Medium Filet mignon with a bernaise sauce - meh. So so so salty. But the quality of the meat wasn't that bad.   Garlic mashed potatoes - decent. Very flavorful with a crisp layer on the top.   The fact that the place was busy is bizarre because the food quality and preparation is disappointing.",

They finally took us to our table, one side booth and the other side a chair. The booth side, where I sat, was very low to the ground so the table was above my chest. Again, no biggie. The server brought us garlic bread (big NO-NO in a supposed \"Italian restaurant\".) which was okay as well as some pickled vegetables, olives, and parmigiana. We ordered the Eggplant Parmesan which was OK. It was a huge piece, so I recommend sharing with a family of 3-4. We then ordered a standard plate of Spaghetti and Tomato Sauce which was AWFUL. It tasted like PURE garlic. We asked the server to pay for the eggplant and we then left. I give it two stars for a nice atmosphere and a nice server. Other than that, a tourist trap at its best.",

The website was no help in informing us that the reservation we made was not legitimate. Had to find out from a bouncer once we were inside that ordering food requires purchasing a table. Would've given 1 star but they did give us free drinks and I would be a fool to be mad about that or turn it down. Wish we could've tried the food, but ultimately had to go elsewhere because we couldn't even get a measly mozzarella stick and we were starving. Girls gotta eat!",

We (party of 3) had calamari- fried just right and was tasty. The 1 lb. MEATBALL was so flavourful.   I highly recommend this dish. Reminded me so much of Zia Giuseppina polpetta's. We had shared everything from the gnocchi, chicken  Parmaggiana and the T-bone steak. Each was prepared and presented perfectly. Your eyes made you more hungry with every dish that came out. Everything tasted amazing and was prepared perfectly. All of the dishes came to the table promptly and were hot when they arrived.  Desserts were abundant with sharing in mind.

    "text": "I've eaten at LAVO twice - both remarkable experiences. They're a restaurant on the Strip that actually has quality food and service with portions at a fair price, and I'm surprised they're not rated higher!  Let me first point out that the ambiance is awesome. I ate here on a Saturday at 7:30pm with my boyfriend, and there was a good crowd. The noise level is loud with conversation and music (they had a DJ), so don't expect this to be a completely intimate place. I would suggest it as a great place to hold a birthday dinner, or even an anniversary date where you're looking for good, hip vibes.   We ordered - Drinks: Pinot Grigio (5/5) and Riesling (3/5) Wasn't as sweet as I had hoped - Complimentary bread and marinara (5/5) So glad we didn't order appetizers! This bread was fresh, warm and fulfilling.  - Spaghetti and Meatballs for him (5/5) My boyfriend swears this is the best spaghetti and meatballs of his life. They're known for their waygu meatballs so they certainly delivered. - Penne Seafood Alfredo for me (4/5) The description says it's a \"light cream butter sauce\", but I would've preferred a heavier parm sauce. Comes with 2 scallops and about 4 large shrimps. Scallops were cooked to perfection. I usually have leftovers, but I ended up finishing my entire dish feeling 100% full and satisfied. - *FREE YELP CHECK-IN DESSERT* Fried Oreos and ice cream (5/5) Comes with six, yet we could only finish three between the both of us because we were so full! Such a delicious treat for a free dish.  Cost: two drinks, 2 entrees, and complimentary dessert was $105 after tax. Not bad at all!!",

A nice looking place, the ambience was great and the relatively dim but not dark setting made it a little more intimate--great for a nice dinner with your significant other, but more than bright enough for a family dinner as well. The perfect balance.   Our server was Adam--and he was a gentleman from the get go. The table next to us was an older couple who was having an issue with their card and payment--and Adam and the manager handled it like professionals. I knew we were in for a great evening.   The menu was great, a nice selection without being \"Cheesecake factory like\" with 400 choices. Adam recommended the giant meatball appetizer. He started ya off on a great foot. It was EXCELLENT!   The pasta was homemade and perfectly cooked. The chicken dish was perfect, and our water glasses were never less than two sips from empty--Adam was right there filling them back up. He was as attentive as you can be--but far from annoying or overbearing. A True professional. On point the entire evening.   The food was excellent, the service top notch, the atmosphere was great. Dinner experience over all was a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10.   The dessert and espresso was above average as well, and there is no doubt I will be back when I am in town. This place is by far the best Italian I have had in Vegas bar none. And Adam's professionalism was a key factor as well!   Enjoy the homemade food in a great environment!!",

    "text": "Where to begin ?  First off ... the service was an absolute 5 stars !!!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient. The bus help was also efficient. No complaints here.   Food ... we had 4 in our party. We ordered a dozen raw oysters which were fresh. The species they serve here are small and thin ... not the huge humongous kind that would fill your tummy with one. Clams covered with bread crumbs placed on a garlic sauce were ok. Seasoning was light but not robust. Main lobster appetizer was very good. Whole lobster split in half on a bed of ice with cocktail sauce and chips. Lobster was fresh. Minestrone soup was very light ... not the tomato-y kind that I'm used to.  Mixed seafood with penne pasta was ok. Mixed seafood with linguine was good. The marinara sauce is a little spicy. Seafood was mostly fresh except for one mussel which tasted a little funky so I had to discard that. Spaghetti with meatballs had mixed reviews. Meatballs were excellent (Wagyu) .. very tender and tasty. Pasta was undercooked ... some parts were still crunchy.  Bread pudding was good. They served it with a small scoop of ice cream. This bread pudding wasn't smothered with that super-sweet sauce that I was hoping for though. The entire meal was ok but nothing outstanding comes to the forefront except for the service.   I've read yelp comments about the noise level being high with loud music but we didn't experience that. Music was subdued just how I like it.    The value I thought was reasonable. The entire bill which also included 2 beers, a glass of wine and a bottled water. So .. everything was over $300 ... with gratuity I paid $405.    Would I return here ?  I might but I'm kind of adventuresome so it wouldn't be after trying out a lot more Italian restaurants first. Maybe Buddy V's next ?  I'm not a gambler so I don't get to Vegas a lot but you never know.",

We arrived around 8 and our table wasn't ready. Then our entire group was led into the back of the restaurant, only to be sent to the front again because our table still wasn't ready.   I got the chance to try the seared octopus, calamari, truffle gnocchi, and carbonara. The octopus and calamari were good, but I didn't really taste the truffle in my gnocchi despite the giant flakes of truffle visible. The carbonara is probably the best bang for your buck, since it comes as a mountain of creamy noodles that will most likely make you full after a couple swirls of the fork.   I've had good Italian food for much less, and while this is Vegas, I think there are hundreds of better restaurants that are more worth trying.",

I ended up eating at the bar, where the bar staff did a good job of taking care of customers, and making good drinks.   For dinner, I had the Chicken Marsala, and a side of a simple spaghetti with tomato sauce. The spaghetti wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably order something different. The Chicken Marsala was very good, and wouldn't have a problem ordering it again. I'd like to go back when my plans don't get messed up, so I can really appreciate the restaurant. I liked the atmosphere, and it seemed like a nice environment to have a meal. I wouldn't have any problem recommending LAVO.",

The place is dim and intimate. We decided to sit at the bar and catch up over some drinks. They weren't extremely busy so I don't understand why we were ignored for awhile before we were serviced. When we finally got a bartender to help us, we ordered a few drinks figuring it'll take awhile to get their attention again. It was perfect timing because we received our second drink right when we finished our first drink. They have a decent selection of drinks at the bar and I would go back but hopefully service will be better next time.",

Service was so sloooooow.  Also, the entree I had was nothing special.  I ordered three eggs any style (scrambled egg whites) with potatoes and toast which was all just so very bland.   They didn't give any jelly or butter to go with my toast and when I realized it, our server was nowhere to be found.  I wasn't crazy either how they had to take my phone to process my restaurant certificate that I had.  To top it all off our table was so close to the party next to us and we had to overhear their annoying conversation.  The couple of things I liked about that visit were the complimentary pastry and the homemade granola that I ordered.    I recommend coming here if you aren't in a hurry and sitting outside if the weather is nice (we were inside on our second brunch visit as we wouldn't have to wait for a table then), and ordering the breakfast Mac and cheese if you come here for brunch.  Now that was very tasty!  After that last visit though, we were put off and won't be coming back soon.",

    "text": "What a location to ring in the New Year in Las Vegas.  The famous restaurant and nightclub from New York City is situated in the main lobby of the Palazzo Las Vegas.  Walking by the restaurant, it is not completely clear whether it is a nightclub versus a restaurant.  After been through a complete dinner service there, I would classify it as somewhere in middle, similar to a supper club - the meal started out as typical classy restaurant vibe, however, as the night progress the DJ slowly increased the music vibes and lighting slowly lowered.  By midnight, the restaurant was closer to ultra lounge.  Service was well executed with a knowledgeable server providing a good recommendation on the selections - this was especially helpful for a restaurant focused on shareable appetizers and entrees.  For a busy evening, the dinner was well coursed out.  For an upscale restaurant the dishes are heaping with food - and great to share.  Favorites were the fried calamari, the giant meatballs, and chicken parmigiana.  Wrapped up the meal close to midnight to enjoy the restaurants sprawling outdoor patio overlooking the Las Vegas strip. Chilly in January, but I imagine this would be great spot to get drinks during the warmer months.    Great experience, and will be back to check out Lavo in Las Vegas.",

Everything was fresh, tasted amazing and was just superb. It's not cheap and I get that I could probably go somewhere else for less, but I was in the area and wanted to try it. The Meatball was so good. I don't like red sauce much, but I even enjoyed the meatball in the red sauce. My wife loved it.  We tried the Wedge Salad as well. Hard to mess up a wedge, but the dressing was excellent and with the crumbles of gorgonzola, tomato halves and the pancetta, it was exceptional. Main Course, my wife tried the Melanzana and I tried the Sea Bass. We were both very happy with our choices. The Bass was perfectly crispy on the edges and tender and flaky on the inside.  Finished with the Oreo Zeppole. I didn't know that oreos could be cooked in a doughnut, but it blew my mind. If I wasn't so full from all the food, I would have eaten all 6 myself. Amazing dessert! The Service was beyond all I expected. I wasn't dressed up much and felt like I would be judged or forgotten. I was VERY wrong. The server was busy so one of the other service team was immediately helping us. He was very courteous and extremely helpful with the questions we had and recommendations for us. The server came by later to check on us and introduce himself and was as friendly as I have ever had in all my experiences. Throughout the meal, but not so often that you get annoyed, we had people check up on us. Drinks were refilled, how is the food, is everything good, etc.. Just a great experience.  If you have been here and had poor service, I would highly recommend DJ & Fender. They, along with the busers and others who helped, were the best I have ever experienced anywhere. Even the managers Chris and Joseph spoke with us and were polite and helpful.  Thank you for that night, it was our last in Las Vegas and the food highlight of the trip!",

For desert you get a free oreo dish with yelp check in, and do it! It was so good. The other deserts tasted very good too although the table was split on the tiramisu.  If you have a reservation, make sure you all show up at the same time or they wont seat you.  Overall was a great experience and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.",

My only complaint (if you can call it that) is it was too much food! I've never had this much food for $50 in my life. The meal included steak, it was cooked medium which is just how I like my steak. It was OK, not the best steak I've ever had but it was seasoned well. I rate my steaks on flavor and whether or not I need a sauce to go with it. A great steak doesn't need anything extra added to it in my opinion, this steak needed a little sauce. Which they have, it wasn't classic steak sauce but it did the trick. The Brandon was good. My first time ever hearing of this fish let alone eating it. It was grilled and tasted delicious. Overall everything we ate was good, it was just a lot. I left nice and stuffed.",

    "text": "My favorite thing about going to Vegas is trying new clubs, restaurants, and hotels. I was excited yet hesitant to spend my 22nd birthday at Lavo this year (10/10) because of the lack of reviews and hype surrounding the club. I made reservations to Pure as well (one of my all time favorite clubs). After a promoted pretty much talked my group into at least checking it out, the night began.   First off Lavo is TINY. Even with table service, all the tables/couches are squeezed together and it doesn't provide you with the ultimate experience because everyone is stuffed in like sausages and it made it easy for people to just walk up and dance and sit in your space. There was no separation from the regular dancing area.   Second, the service is less than impressive. Our table server Megan was rude did not help make the occasion special but actually took away from the experience.  Third, the music was horrible and even intoxicated found it difficult to dance too.  And finally after only one bottle of kettle one was consumed we were kicked out without warning because they thought my friend was \"too drunk\". With a whole bottle left you can imagine I was less than thrilled.   I couldn't believe this club shares an owner with Tao, it was awful and I will never be going back. Please don't make the same mistake I did, and go somwhere else (Tao, Pure, LAX, Rain).",

We were here for my bachelorette party and made the reservation weeks in advance. After our entire party of 9 waited for 30 minutes, the host gave us a round of drinks while \"two large tables paid their checks\". The bar had ONE BARTENDER and the poor girl was swamped. When she wasn't making drinks she was dealing with people yelling at her that they weren't getting their Bud Lights fast enough. Hire more bartenders! After another 25 minutes, we still had not been seated. This leads me to believe that the host was lying about the tables paying their checks or the staff was too incompetent to collect the checks. We were being told the tables were there for over 2.5 hours but they couldn't ask them to leave. Living in New York City, I know that there is a polite way to ask large groups to move their conversations to the bar if they're no longer ordering at the table and just taking up another reservation spot. An hour after our reservation time we were seated and proceeded to have a great meal and excellent service. Bottom line - don't expect to be seated on time. Even though the waiter and the food were great, I can find better food and not wait 60 minutes.",

Back then I had a Caprese salad with green tomatoes and it was delicious.  I went back there and there was a similar mozzarella tomato salad on the menu but it wasn't the same.  There wasn't enough balsamic vinegar, which turned out to be a good thing because it was sour.  My husband had the Caesar Salad which was great but over priced.  We also had the chicken Parmesan which was too salty and definitely over priced. They didn't serve it with anything which was disappointing for the price. I asked for the dessert to go and confirmed that they were packing the strawberry shortcake but I ended up with the cheesecake.  Cheesecake was good but the cherries was sour.  Aside from the food, the music was fun and I liked the decor.  The waiters were friendly.",

As my husband complained to our waiter, we are not at in and out. When paying $28  for  old pasta, expect  a lot more.  Very clear not just from our experience but from others their goal is to turn tables as fast as possible to a point it felt insulting. At the least after we voiced complaints the waiter could of at least offered to comp a drink that didn't show up for at least 20 minutes. Go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I came on a Saturday night, and for once, I didn't actually look at Yelp reviews beforehand so I didn't know what to expect. I just came because some friends of friends were all into this place. At first, I was like, wha?? entree = club admission? What kind of decent, respectable place does THAT? And my mind was confused as it did not match the flashy style of previously-mentioned friends of friends.  So a bit reluctantly but also curious, I went. Inside, I would describe the restaurant as dark and lusty. Yes, I said lusty. This is Vegas after all. Anyway, we were able to sit in the front bar portion without a reservation which was nice since it was a last minute thing.   The menu items don't actually sound that appealing to be honest. Rather plain, ho-hum descriptions. But when we ordered, my god, the portions were HUGE! I must've missed something about family style, but lordy, you could've fed a whole village of my ancestors. So of course, we ordered WAY too much food. But my favorite dish was the beet salad. I wish I lived closer to you, beet salad. I'd totally order you again and again. I also got a lobster bisque - too salty for me though, and a little creamier than I like. We had the risotto with short ribs which was sorta the oddity on the menu (one of these kids is doing his own thing). The waitress told us it wasn't ordered a lot, but I still wanted to try it. It was good, not the best. One of my friends loved it, but I probably wouldn't order it again. We got the meatball - tasty and the size of a softball. Then there was a veal dish that I didn't try. But back to you, beet salad. You were the best beet salad ever. Perfect balance of beets, goat cheese, greens, candied nuts, etc.   So I was about to roll over from being so full, but I love dessert so I ordered the bread pudding. Again, a huge portion shared by about 4 main people, and 4 supporting cast. It was yummm-my. A keeper.   Then onto the club part and time to work off the billion calories just consumed. The waitress stamped our hands. We wandered around inside The Palazzo a little, then headed back to Lavo for the club portion. It was a little chaotic around the entrance/elevator, but the stamp allowed us to enter without waiting or paying. Big plus. Up the elevator, to the club. It's not very big, and all the tables are reserved with bottle service. Annoying because as a girl, you just want to have a place where you can sit or put your purse, coat, etc. Anyway, we danced but the place soon got VERY crowded, the DJ was just alright, and again, the fact that you can't really sit anywhere around the dance floor was a negative. So we left to meet up with a friend who was at the circular bar in the Palazzo casino. Honestly I had just as much fun, probably more, in the casino bar.   In the end, Lavo's food was a pleasant surprise, I didn't care much for the club, and I'd consider going back but it wouldn't be my first choice. I did like the casino bar though. I'd go there :)",

    "text": "I couldnt hold out any longer and finally came out to a nightclub for the 1st time since being a new Las Vegas resident. I had heard about Lavo before (I always thought it was a pool... kinda like Wet Republic) but never went. Also, the thing about Vegas is, if youre a dude and you wanna go out to these popular nightspots with your boys (and plan to get in in a decent amount of time) you either gotta 1. spend $$$ like theres no tommorro 2. get lucky (walk in with some girls you just met, come up with some bs story about how you know someone there, etc) 3. come in late (past 130 or so) 4. or have a hookup.... Fortunately we had a hookup so off we went.  The downstairs (restaurant) part of lavo is nice. They were giving us appetizers and drinks (on the house) all night, so no complaints there. A sizeable group of saints fan (congratulations!) were at the bar partying up. At about 11:30 we walked out and walked right past the line to the club (thats were the hookup comes in handy). Lavo reminds me alot of The Bank Nightclub at the Venetian. SMALL. We had bottle service, but there was no rope to keep away the straglers, so everyone was just mixed in (just like at The Bank nightclub). I thought the whole point of bottle service was to have your own space? The DJ was beyond terrible. I kid you not he did not play one song that was made after 2004 until right before I left. Just all Lil' Jon songs. Im not a DJ, never have been, and probably never will be, but I could have came up with a better list. The chick who won the first season of \"For The Love of Ray J\" (I think her name was cocktail?) is a gogo dancer there. I mean I had fun I guess, but there are definitely better places.",

I could not stop eating them, they were a perfect balance of Garlic and cheese.   After dinner the hostess asked if we wanted a stamp so that we can you to the nightclub, we said sure and headed out to the nightclub.  After looking at the line we practically ran the other way.  Trashy, young...did I say trashy?

    "text": "Club only review - here's why it's not worth your time.  Went on Sun, March 14  One main dance floor, absolutely no room to dance. You're just elbowing other guys back and forth.   5-8% of the girls were HOT (as in prime) AND unattached, 25-30% above average. You see groups of butt ugly girls getting in without waiting. The majority of the girls' attires were somewhat unfashionable/nothing unique. 25-30% were dressed sexy.  Dancefloor - most of the normal looking girls weren't really stuckup/uptight or anything.   Guys are mostly alright looking, 5-10% prime hot guys. Guys attires weren't bad, the usual mass untucked dress shirt over jeans wasn't as bad. Moderately young crowd, 21-33, with a few older couples. It was not ghetto. We waited  almost 2 hours to get in. You might as well as pay general admission and get in earlier than wait long only to be past the 1am guestlist deadline, then it's just the same price. Make up your mind beforehand, don't just wait in the guestlist line for an hour and then decide to switch to gen admission.  Club ambience and decor - better than average, felt somewhat stylish but not luxorous. Minus points for the really bright strobe/flash lights going off to 90s hip hop in the middle of the dance floor.  The WORST part is the P.O.S. DJ, absolutely horrible. Plays songs from the radio and 90s old school crap at the height of the night. He changes the song every 60-90 seconds so by the time you get used to the beat, it changes. Every five minutes, he breaks into the song to call lame shout outs like \"who's from cali?\" \"who's from cali drinking?\" \"whose birthday is it?\" @ around 2:30? 3am, started playing some slightly decent trance/house.   It was pretty packed for a Sunday night in March, and there's barely room to dance already. The deal-killer was the DJ. I don't know where that guy gets is music/playlist. Hearing him for that first 5 minutes totally ruined the mood, especially after the wait and paying full price. I'd prefer Tao over Lavos.  *I'm really burning the DJ because I expected a lot better from a club like that, go back to DJing for local clubs/stripclubs please!!!",

    "text": "Don't eat here.  I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.  They seated our party in a semi-circular booth, with me sitting in a chair at the edge of the table.  People were running in to me the whole 2 hours we were there, and we were there for 2 hrs because it took over an hour and a half from when our order was placed until our food was brought out.  When they finally did bring out the food, they had dropped my meal so I had to wait another 15 minutes before I could eat.  They didn't even offer to take anything off my bill for the inconvenience.  All of this would have been at least tolerable if the food had at least been good, but it wasn't.  I ordered veal parmigiana, and the meat was so thin and the cheese piled on so thickly that you couldn't even taste the veal.  This was definitely the worst dining experience of my life.  Next time I'm in Vegas with people wanting to go to Lavo, I'm skipping out on it and going to In-n-Out Burger.",

    "text": "Review for the lounge only.  Came here with the BF and a huge group of coworkers and friends. You have to walk through an empty restaurant to get to the nightlife area, so my first impression was that the night didn't seem too promising...  We had a table right next to the DJ with ropes separating our area from the relatively small dance floor. Our bottle service girl was wonderfully attentive and poured our drinks for us all night. The crowd was a bit older and thankfully the dance floor wasn't terribly packed. That being said, if I were a bachelor, this wouldn't be my first choice to meet a hot group of biddies.  All in all, my group and I had a great time. I'd only visit this place again if I for some reason stayed at the Venetian, and even then, it wouldn't be the main attraction of the night.",

    "text": "Nice restaurant. Good music but a bit loud because its popular. Good service. Fair prices.   They start by serving hot garlic bread and marinara for free. Garlic bread is a bit greasy and I didn't want to ruin my meal so I didn't have too much. Kobe meatball with ragu and ricotta $22 is good not spectacular. Veal chop parmiggiano was big too and only $33. Veal is breaded, thin, very good quality. Cheese is all over and a bit overpowering. Sauce was limited and mostly below the veal. I used sobe if the marinara from the garlic bread to supplement the meaty spicier sauce. The hostess will stamp your wrist if you want to go to the nightclub after your dinne is paid. Also, have outdoor seating overlooking the Bellagio.",

    "text": "Our server was fantastic, although his name escapes me at the moment (tall, very short hair). I complimented the manager on the entire experience. At fancier restaurants, I tend to notice that my boyfriend and I (both in our early-mid twenty's) do not get the same attention as the group of businessmen that are sitting at the table two down from us. I understand the stereotype, especially because younger people usually can't afford to eat out at places of this one's stature. However, this was definitely not the case here.   Our server greeted us right away and offered us cocktails, although we both only ordered water. He walked us through the menu, giving suggestions, explaining the food & specialty items and answering my  myriad of questions with patience and a smile.  We started with the Tuna Tartare Appetizer, which was out of this world. The tuna was fresh and the sauce complimented it perfectly.   I had the minestrone soup after that, which was also good, but nothing extraordinary.  For dinner, I had the rock shrimp lemon zest risotto. And WOW, my mouth still waters just thinking about it.  My boyfriend had the Bone in Filet. The flavor was unmatched. I've been to many a fancy steakhouses, but this was the best bone in filet I'd ever had. Although it came out EXACTLY as our server described it, there was no irritation when my boyfriend asked for it to be cooked a little bit more before we packed it to go.  Overall, everything was wonderful. I wish I didn't live quite so far away, or this would quickly become a weekly favorite.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner with another couple at Lavo's on August 21, 2015.  We had seen a show on TV espousing the 1-pound meatball there, and were excited to try it.  We ordered one as an appetizer for the four of us, and it was one of the best meatballs any of us ever had.   Why only 2 stars for this place?  My first objection was that our table of four was served what looked to be about a half loaf of a small Italian garlic bread with marinara on the side.  If we had been a party of two I can't imagine they would serve us half that portion.  We all ordered cocktails, salads, and entrees, ( in addition to the 1- lb. meatball that we shared), and while we waited for our food we gobbled down the garlic bread.  So I asked our waiter to bring us more.  He told us he'd be happy to, but there was a $6 charge for a second helping!  What?!!!  If all we had ordered was cocktails and appetizers, maybe I could forgive that!  But that seemed outrageous to us!  However, The plain Italian bread with marinara was no extra charge. We asked the waiter to space out the entrees when our salads came on top of the meatball, and he said he would see what he could do. The Caesar salad I got was wonderful, but the second thing I disliked was that our entrees arrived before we had even finished the salads! The third thing that disappointed was that I ordered the chicken Marsala, and it was paper thin and tough, very salty, and the mushrooms were overcooked and black with the texture of leather.  I had a few bites and had the waiter take the rest away.  I told him to tell the chef it was not good, and the waiter asked if I would like to speak with management.  I replied no, that I wasn't looking to get a discount on my meal.  I just wanted them to know.  I really hoped he would tell the manager anyway and send him over, but he didn't.  We had ordered more drinks and declined dessert and coffee, and, are you ready for this?!  Our waiter asked if we would like to take our drinks into the bar to finish them!   We said no!  Please!  We had been seated there for all of one hour!  I don't call that over-staying one's welcome with the money we spent there that night! All in all, I don't think a great meatball is worth returning there.",

    "text": "Loud club music at 7pm. Too early and loud.  Chicken Marsala didn't come with pasta which isn't always the case so no worries there. When I asked for pasta as an add on, I was told the only pasta was penne with tomato sauce. Who in their right mind as a server in an Italian restaurant would even offer tomato sauce with marsala? It just doesn't go together. So I ask about some linguini, but the only have full portions and again with tomato sauce. So I said skip the pasta and give me a side of the garlic mashed potatoes.  I got the meal and it looked great they brought mashed potatoes (if you can call it that) and penne pasta with tomato sauce. The mashed potatoes came in a ramekin and was covered in cheese and tossed under the salamander (broiler). It was watery, oily and extremely salty. In what's supposed to be a fine dining establishment this looked and tasted worse than some hole in the wall place.   The Marsala was overly reduced into a glaze, scratch that, more of a sweet syrup. It was also quite salty. I only managed to finish the main course and I had to force myself to do it. If I wasn't out with others for the occasion it was, I would have escalated the issue to management.   The tomato sauce was tasty but by the time I tasted it, I had so much salt in me that I wasn't sure if it was the sauce or me that was salty (no pun intended).  All in all it wasn't a great food experience. Perhaps those who enjoyed it liked the ambiance and the club and were drinking a lot. Non of the others who were there with me that night were impressed or remembered the meal.  On a plus side, I did get to see David Spade there.",

I had to scrape it all off and just eat the piece of chicken, which was not worth the price. Strawberry shortcake for dessert was more scone textured and without a lot of flavor.

    "text": "LAVO should be known for their meatballs AND Panna Cotta Cheesecake!!  *This review is for the restaurant only*  After hearing that LAVO had the best meatballs in town and good food overall, I just had to go and try it for myself. We came here with my good friends from Hawaii. I made reservations on a week night when there was no special event going on at the nightclub, hoping it would be less crowded.  At first, service was good. We had 3 different servers who said that they would all be helping us. However, after our drinks were delivered, we got stuck with one server, who was kind of an airhead. I'll be nice and not mention her name, but this is how it went down. We were all obviously ready to order because our menus were closed and stacked nicely on one corner of the table. Server: \"Are you all ready to order, or do we need a few more minutes?\" Us: \"We're ready.\" Server: \"I'll give you a few more minutes.\" Us: \"Umm, we just said we were ready.\" Server: \"Oh ok, go ahead.\" Then later that night.... Server: \"Are you still working on this or do you want me to take the plate out of your way?\" My friend: \"Still working on it.\" Server: *reaches out to grab the plate* My Friend:\" No, I am STILL working on it!\" Server: \"Oh, ok.\" Geeez, she had serious issues! Also note that we ate here right after they opened, so the place wasn't crazy loud at the time. If she's deaf, she shouldn't be a server. She really needs to get her act together! Horrible!  Anyway, the food was awesome and we all enjoyed our dinner. We ordered the Meatball with whipped fresh Ricotta. Good thing we split it between the 4 of us because it was huge! Very flavorful and melted in my mouth! I wanted more, so I ordered the Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs. My husband ordered the New York Strip Steak and said it was one of the best steaks he ever had. Now I know what to order next time! Our friends ordered the Chicken Parmigiano (also huge) and some other pasta dish. And now for the best part, Dessert!! Thanks to my friends, I am now addicted to the Panna Cotta Cheesecake! I don't know how to explain it, except to say that is was a big delicious slice of heavenly, creamy berry goodness! Sometimes Cheesecakes can be too rich, but this one was light and not overly sweet. Slices are big enough for 2 people to share, but I honestly think I could eat the entire thing on my own. I would seriously do a take out order, just for the cheesecake!  Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. Hopefully, service will be better next time!",

The dance floor - Packed! in a good way, not overpacked, and the people were appropriately good about it and were there only to have fun. The bouncers were professional, a big plus.

The salads were pretty small and the crudos plate, which was like sashimi in some kind of oily sauce, was far from amazing. One of my friends ordered pasta which tasted the best of all our entrees. We also ordered wine, which for some reason was served in drinking glasses. I guess they ran out of wine glasses. The atmosphere,  however, was great. Nice bar and great decorations.. Check out the bathroom too.  After dinner, we went to the club upstairs.. It was quite small but not too crowded. Although it doesn't compare to its counterpart Tao, Lavo had good music, friendly bartenders and a decent crowd.",

My wife had the Crispy Chicken Dominic.  Wow, both dishes were very tasty and we couldn't decide whose dish we liked the best... They were both delicious!  Darn that Paris buffet we had earlier...it left us with no room for dessert. Yes we will definitely return to Lavo on our next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "We went to Lavo's nightclub our first night in Vegas for something chill, and ate at the restaurant our last night to go out with a bang.   What we got was something.. average. For all the hype and celeb appearances surrounding Lavo I was expecting a unique party scene but it was more cookie cutter and mainstream than I'd hoped. Like a really upscale Cheesecake Factory. Hopefully that doesn't come off as bad as it sounds.  We might've gone on the wrong night for the club, seeing as how we wanted something chill but still fun. But it was too chill..  and quiet? The club isn't really condusive to dancing and the DJ was just okay. But it's nice, in a dark but clean, pretty cocktail waitresses kind of way. Maybe we were the sober ones but we ended up leaving after about an hour.   On our last night in Vegas we wanted a celebatory girls' dinner so I made reservations at Lavo ahead of time. Now, the best part of Lavo is obviously not the food. The food was okay. (My short ribs risotto tasted strongly of seafood. The spaghetti had a sauce so acidic I had heartburn the rest of the night. But the fried calamari... yes!!) It's the people watching and scene that Lavo's known for. Most of the crowd were in their 20's, but there were also a couple older folks.  One thing I loved about the restaurant was that it was a mixed crowd, and for a glitz and tits kind of place, I didn't feel uncomfortable and I doubt other people would either, given they know what to expect. There were couples in their 50's enjoying a romantic night out, a group of 15 doing the cha-cha (literally) around their table, groups in jeans and sneakers, and the staff is surprisingly unpretentious.  Lavo's a cool place and I think if you want that 'night out' vibe at dinner then it's worth going to at least once. But there isn't enough to make me want to run back.",

    "text": "**LAVO the RESTAURANT - Thumbs Up***  ///PROS/// - Great decor--(reminded me of Tao NY), lighting, ambiance and menu - Get the meatball w/ a salad--plenty of food for a late night dinner for two before dancing. The meatball is amazing--plus we were surprised by the price in a good way. One would think this to be more given the size. - Shared servers--but all were very nice, hospitable, friendly and attentive. No complaints at all. - One waiter did try to find better olives for my husbands martini's in the kitchen, he did bring some albeit not actual martini olives. Much thanks for trying! - Great tunes (a cross between electronica and top 40 dance)--made for a fun atmosphere  ///CONS/// - Host/Hostess appear bored/annoyed--you can almost see their eyes roll inside their heads - If you like martini's with good olives this is not the spot. My husband was very disappointed by the baseline bar olives (and surprisingly they are far worse than say a Cheesecake Factory (when we go with our son). Martini's are all about the quality of gin or vodka--and olives. We were quite surprised for an Italian menu that olives were not a core here.  ///IF YOU GO.../// - You'll get access to Lavo the Club w/out a huge line/fee  ///NO COMMENT/// - Outdoor seating. We'd actually had a reservation for outside-but decided to stay inside as the ambiance seemed like a lot of fun. We noticed there were lots of smokers out there--so we probably wouldn't have liked that very much anyway.  ///WOULD WE EAT AT LAVO AGAIN?/// - Definitely, but kind of unlikely as we don't plan to stay at The Palazzo again  ***LAVO the Club - BRIDGE & TUNNEL ****  ///PROS/// - Very short wait coming from the restaurant - Amazing hall between stairs and club--cool sinks with water on lined both sides of a floating walk-way. Very cool. - VIP tickets to Tao Beach (although we'd planned on going to Azure so didn't need them)  ///CONS/// Where do I begin? - Bridge & Tunnel--that's what we'd call it in SF in terms of the people, messy drunks, dress, attitude, atmosphere and music - Hip Hop Galore. We'd asked one of our waiters about Lavo/Tao (bc we were looking for electronica DJ's) so we knew this was probably NO the spot--and it was confirmed. THANK GOD my husband had not secured a table (as per our original plan) bc we lasted 5 min. I simply can NOT stand the music and vibe. - So friggin' small--even if you like that sort of music. The \"large screen\" behind the DJ was smaller than our projector at home. And the laser \"art\" laughable. The DJ looked like they were spinning on a (horrible) Carnival Cruise I'd experienced circa 1994. Everything about the design was off/wrong--and def. NOT cool/modern/hip. To improve--I'd suggest changing that screen to something larger--and put something on there that is hip/fresh in relation to the music. For hip-hop--gritty city photos (style of How to Make in in America would be good inspiration). - Did I mention you cannot move--let alone dance (again if you like the music) without seriously rubbing up against some sweaty bodies? Ew.  ///IF YOU GO.../// - Go to the restaurant to shorten access time (we did notice non-restaurant folks were in a huge line that was not moving--and it was seriously packed upstairs) - Get a table if you need a seat, a breather from sweaty/drunk folks and just need a lil' space.  - Investigate the DJ before you plop down any dough--and make sure it's tunes you dig (we would NOT have been happy had we spent any cash on this one) - Have low expectations of a club. If you've been to clubs in Paris, NY (Limelight, Tunnel, Webster Hall), Philly (The Bank, Tracadero, Black Banana), SF (1015, Ruby Skye) to name a few--you will not be luvin' this club regardless of the tunes.  ///WOULD WE TRY LAVO THE CLUB AGAIN?/// - Hells to the NO.  ***SEE OUR OTHER REVIEWS***  + The Palazzo + Lavo + Lavo the Club + Azure the Beach Club + Tao Club + Sushi Samba",

The service was fantastic - they were on top of all our individual drink orders & kept checking back frequently (and remembered what we were each drinking).  The food was all excellent!  We had so much (family style), it's hard to pick favorites.  I never saw a menu because food was ordered for us, but some of the standouts were: beet salad, giant meatball, cold seafood tiered plate (with prawns, lobster, crab meat, tuna tartar & oysters), sea bass, green beans, chicken parmesan and chocolate rolled cake.   I'm not a fan of the battered & fried oreos or the tiramisu, but other people at our table enjoyed them.    I would definitely come back here & look to try the Lavo in NY.   PS - towards the end of our dinner, we noticed it turning into a club - there were A LOT of attractive people hanging around. Must be a hot spot.",

It was SO worth it. And we didn't feel out of place at all.  Amazing. That is one word to sum it up. We requested to be seated outside, and we were promptly taken out. Amazing table with view of the Siren Show at TI. BONUS! Plus just the vibe of sitting above the strip has such good energy!  The bread that comes out is great, the marinara sauce is a bit plain, but by all means is not bad. We shared a Caesar salad, and my goodness it was HUGE. It was a great salad. The dressing was so good. Quite enjoyable! Our server was excellent. Fast and not pushy at all. I ordered the Margarita  Pizza and my husband ordered the Chicken Parm. My pizza was exceptional. Flat bread, cheesy. Delish! His chicken plate was HUGE. It was very yummy.   Tiramisu was great. Some of the best I've had. It tasted so fresh.  I would definitely eat here again!! Well done Lavo!",

Well, I guess it's not really required to tip - but don't be an asshole.  As far as the night club goes, it's pretty decent. They have open bar for ladies from 10 to 11 I believe? Maybe even until 12. And they make their drinks pretty strong, which for me, is always a plus.   In comparison to other night clubs - it's nothing special. I go to Lavo, simply for the open bar. If it weren't for that, I probably wouldn't go there oo often.",

If you're a hotel guest admission is free.  If you have a Grazie Card, you don't have to wait in line.  Nice place to count down the new year or celebrate a birthday!!!",

    "text": "The guest list line was OUT-THE-DOOR when we got here at 11pm.  Because of that, I stepped out of line to find something to snack on and subsequently missed when they were handing out wristbands for the guest list people.  Fail moment.  Fortunately, the men holding the list gave me a wristband no questions asked.  Thanks!  Came to LAVO on a Tuesday night (yehyuh) with my girls.  No cover charge for us so we used our open bar privileges and ordered 3 Long Islands and an AMF.  The bartender made these 4 drinks all at once, and so quickly.  She was definitely hasty because my drink was much stronger than the rest!    I was really feeling the music the ENTIRE night (and I'm usually critical of DJs).  This DJ threw down some favorable beats with good mixing; I danced for an hour straight at one point.  We were showered with foam at points in the night.  Foam gets stuck in your hair and stings your eyes if you look up!    The dance floor was petite compared to others that I've been to.  You know when the dance floor is small when you keep running into the SAME guys throughout the night.  It gets crowded, for sure.    The ladies room was next to the coat check area & the line was minimal at the restroom!  At the end of the night, I realized that I dropped my driver's license somewhere on the dance floor. :(  The rest of my trip would have sucked without it.  I talked to a bouncer, who calmed me down and gave me tips to contact the lost-and-found.  The club recovered my license and I was able to pick it up the next morning.  I am forever indebted.",

He pointed us upstairs. THANK YOU SIR! We proceeded to the upper level of Lavo.. OHHHHH so this is where the party is at!

It's located in the Palazzo which is a sister hotel of the Venetian. If you're a guest at either of these hotels, they provide you \"tickets\" to the club. These \"tickets\" do not bypass the general line nor the guest list line. It's not even free! You still have to dish out $5 extra (if I remembered) for each admission... I was really intoxicated at that time, but I believe the entrance and exits are through different sides. It was confusing just to get out!  I did not have a good experience at LAVO and will probably not come back unless I was dragged here.",

Pretty small place, so it gets super crowded quick.   I'd definitely recommend coming here for the FREE open bar for ladies, but probably wouldn't spend your whole night here (unless you came with guys who had to pay to get in..that'd be just rude if you asked me).",

The linguine didn't feel completely cooked (I was later informed that this is how the chef cooks it) and there was just too much going on on such a small plate!  I then ordered the penne alfredo and it was a bit better but still saucy and too overwhelming.  I'm getting a bit nauseated even thinking about it.  The service was awesome however.  The man checking on each table was very sweet when I asked for a change and made sure the alfredo was rushed through.  I think the food was entirely too heavy.  Ambiance is nice but a bit crowded.

One dessert wouldn't have been enough for the 3 of us, but the layer cake is huge and rich- we couldn't finish it between the 3 of us. The desserts were very delicious and affordably priced (for Vegas). This was the best part! The only redeeming point of the visit, unfortunately. The service was really poor. Our waitress was pretty neglectful. I could be more understanding if it was a peak time of day or if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't. We could see her chatting and laughing with other staff/hostesses at the front of the restaurant for extended periods of time - not quick banter, but  long conversations. Long periods of time would pass before she came back to check on us and our water glasses sat empty for a long period before tracking someone down to ask for a refill.  The restaurant's ambiance is pretty and the desserts were tasty, so I wish the service was better to complete the experience - but definitely lacking on this visit.",

We came with a party 11- we were seated immediately, and received great service. We had a tall young man with dark hair (comb over- very handsome) take care of our table. He was outstanding! Very attentive & kind.   Good was fresh and flavorful. The decor made you feel warm and comfortable.   We started with a couple aps- two of the outstanding 1lb meatball with ricotta, the octopus, and the fried calamari. All were excellent, except for the octopus- it came out cold. Other than that, solid choices. They do give fresh flavorful bread with some antipasto, yum.   I personally ordered the pasta with shrimp and scallops. It was absolutely delightful. Bravo. I did have to ask for ricotta because I'm extra haha. Flavor was definitely there.  Also, we had many sides of the truffle Parmesan fries- YUM! Warning: the portion is a little big, you will be tempted to eat all of it.   As for the other 10 plates, delightful. Everyone in the party was truly satisfied.   We did skip dessert because we were so full, but once I come back- I definitely will not miss out.   Great service, warm decor, fresh food. Win.   I absolutely cannot wait to come back. As I am a regular to Las Vegas & The Palazzo.   Thank You LAVO for making my experience superb.  Savannah",

Service was excellent and servers suggestions on the mark. Not super expensive. Definitely a good choice if you are confused and have no definite plan. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.   No room for dessert. But coffee was good.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  I met with a group of friends here for a birthday brunch. Lavo has several brunch options depending on the size of your party. We ended up at a good sized table, but the chairs were a bit to crammed together on the side I sat on leaving not much wiggle room. Our servers were nice and good about checking on our group. The decor is really elegant and nice in some areas and then it can look really ugly and twisted. For example if you go upstairs to the Lavo Casino, the last hallway of stairs you go up has these lanterns filled with feathers inside it. It straight up looks like a birdcage where a bird exploded inside of it and was really disturbing to see in my opinion. There's a hallway just before the previously mentioned disturbing stairs, but what happens in that hallway stays there, so no comment! Then they have chandeliers with lampshades on top of them in the downstairs restaurant, wtf?! It's just a real mix of decor like they couldn't pick a theme to go with. The waiting area right where you enter has a very beautiful and peaceful setting. I really loved the sound of water and design they did there.  Coffee ($4.50) - Very good. Tasted great and complimented my meal nicely.   Almond Crusted French Toast ($17) - Cinnamon, panettone, fresh berries and bananas. French toast is one of my go-to choices for breakfast, so I had to try it. I'm a girl who likes real maple syrup with my french toast and pancakes and I was very surprised that this dish did not come with any! Kinda weird, but my friend who got some with her pancakes shared with me. The berries and bananas were very fresh and delicious. The french toast was thick with a tasty, sweet and crunchy crust. Overpriced for the portion, but delicious.   Applewood Bacon ($7) - I figured they would only bring out 2 pieces, so I was surprised to see 4 on the plate. Our group had yelpers in it, so naturally we were taking pictures of our food as well sharing our food with each other. Having 4 pieces meant there was more to go around and I personally thought it had great flavor with the sweet and crispy edges being my favorite.   Chicken Apple Sausage ($7) - Sweet and tasty flavor. Comes with 3 sausages. Try this if you are going to eat here, trust me. It's really good.   Margherita Pizza ($19) - Fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil. If you know me, you know I love pizza. This pizza was not legit. Maybe they don't serve the pizzas hot here or maybe because we had a large group it was sitting out before being brought out, but the pizza was barely warm. I can't even get into the crust it just wasn't legit.   16 oz. Kobe Meatball ($22) - Way over-hyped and a total novelty in my opinion. They have a larger one on the dinner menu (32 oz.) and these large meatballs are what most people come here to try. I was really excited to try it and then not so excited after doing so. It just tasted like an average meatball and it wasn't very moist, at least the section I had. Folks, it was mini meatloaf covered in tomato sauce instead of ketchup.   Blue Skies Pancakes ($16) - Blueberry compote, yogurt pearls and whipped cream. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious and the blueberries tasted great. Not sure like the french toast if the portion was fair for the price, but it did taste great.   They have bottomless mimosas for $30 during brunch which isn't a bad deal and they have other drink options also if you don't like that type of drink. I like that they offer a variety here instead of just the mimosa giving people options.      Depending on the weather, you could ask to be seated outside on the patio and enjoy views on the Strip while you dine. I definitely enjoyed more than I didn't and wouldn't rule out returning at some point in the future.",

    "text": "I came here last Memorial Day Weekend because one of my local friends wanted to hang out. She was able to give me some Free Passes for the girls in my group but the guys had to pay $30. It's a pretty nice venue with decorative splurges on the same level as Tao but not as nice as XS or Tryst. There's a catwalk to the second floor that has all these sinks with water faucets turned on. This bothers me because I consider myself an \"Environmentalist\" and this wastes a lot of water. In my drunken stupor, I was frantically turning off all the faucets. WTF? There are some cute Go-Go dancers and the girls rubbing on each other a la Tao-style.   Pros:  -According to my friend, on Sundays, ladies have open bar until midnight.  -Nice venue.  -Decent music. Hip hop and Top 40 but nothing new. The typical popular songs that have been played in clubs for the last couple of years.  -Bartender was fairly quick with the drinks.  -Doormen were pretty friendly. Very rare in Vegas.   Cons:  -Kinda ghetto crowd. Younger people, early to mid-20s.  -WAY too crowded. I felt jostled to death. If it wasn't for my hubby looking out for me, I probably would've caught a dozen elbows to the head on the dance floor.  -Bouncers yelling \"Can't stand here. Keep it moving.\" It's so annoying even though I know they're just looking out for our safety and keeping it clear.   Overall, Lavo is a-okay. It's not my first choice but I wouldn't be opposed to going again.",

My sister and I shared the mozarella balls and my god they were so good! We still talk about them! The portions are good sized and its authentic Italian food so if you order the shrimp scampi youre gonna get shrimp. Not olive garden style where it comes with pasta and never ending salad and breadsticks (shout out to the party pooper of the group ;D )  Its in the Palazzo so if you are staying there or are in Vegas and want some good Italian food give it a try!",

KC also recommended a drink that wasn't on the menu that was made or Rose wine and some type of blueberry vodka that was just absolutely divine! Omg this place is soooo yummy and the service was the definition of impeccable we will definitely be going back to LAVO with all our friends on our next Vegas trip!",

So I came here for a date with the special lady because I really wanted to get some good food and I figured I would give Lavo a try.  So the best thing about this meal for me were two things: the garlic bread that is fresh baked and served with marinara sauce, and the DAMN KOBE MEATBALL.  Both were so freaking good.  I had most of the garlic bread myself and had to fight off my lady with a butter knife for it.  The sea bass and tiramisu are pretty good too, but most definitely come for the garlic bread and stay for the meatball.  On a side note, their in-house cocktails are really really good.",

Dinner here was perfectly adequate for an Italian restaurant, however it was nothing special.  Price wise, I would say that this place is rather overpriced, as I don't feel the meal we had was worth it.  Also, the waiters can be kind of iffy, which I felt was a shame.  The portions are large, but not family style large.  My cousin and I split two appetizers and one main and were plenty full.  Decent wine list, but I would actually expect something better for an Italian restaurant on the Strip.  Overall, was perfectly fine, but nothing special.  I'd say save your money and go elsewhere.",

When you first walk in, you walk over a little bridge that overlooks the bottom floor and leads you into the main dance floor. The bar area is very tight especially because most people find themselves just standing there to stay away from the overcrowded dance floor.   The drinks were odd... gin and tonic tasted like rubber and my jack and coke needed a heck of a lot more jack! I think the reason why I didn't enjoy this place as much as I thought I would is because half the people here were terribly uptight.. kind of reminded me of LA which is a big turn off for me. This is Vegas people, be drunk and loosen up for crying out loud!  Besides that, the staff at the front door were really nice. Yea.. that's it.",

We spoke with the door man and he told us that he could not accommodate 17 people, unless we purchased bottle service ($1500 minimum)....as they were letting about 20 people into the club who were not together. We asked if we broke our group up into smaller groups could we get in and and the bouncer said \"No you already said 17, so you have to get bottle service or we cannot let you in\" WTF!? Trying to force bottle service is tacky at best. What a joke. So we got out of line and wondered over to V Bar, where they were more than happy to accommodate our group without bottle service. Later I was told that Lavo was run by the same people who ran Tao Nightclub and it all made sense..... both places radiate douche bag ambiance. I expected more...",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I had a pretty poor experience at LAVO despite of the great interior design, funny bathrooms, good music, and above-average desserts. I think the problem with this place is the price/performance ratio. The complimentary garlic bread was decent. We ordered 2 appetizers: calamari and eggplant parmegiano. Calamari was barely OK but eggplant was good. The main platter that I had was seafood pasta for $38 and the dish was super salty and acidic due to overuse of tomatoes. My wife ordered one of the fish dishes over which they poured balsamic vinegar without double checking with my wife. She was so disgusted with the fish she had to send it back. The next fish she got was salty as well but at least she thought it was well cooked. We finished the dining experience with an order of 2 desserts and both were above average. Overall, pretty average food that you can probably get elsewhere 1/3 of the price with a much better taste.  My biggest problem was our waitress. After she took our drink and appetizer orders, she disappeared for 20 mins. When our appetizers showed up, I asked another poor fellow whether we are gonna be able to order the main dishes if our princess waitress decides to show up. She came over in another 5 minutes, didn't even apologize and pretended like nothing happened. We had to wait for the main dishes for another 30 mins. We didn't get water refreshments and I think we have been only asked once if we need more drinks in that time. When the food came, I was already feeling filled but ate the whole thing because I was very angry (and it is super hard to make me angry).  When my wife's food turned out to be bad, the manager came over and apologized so +1 for the manager.  Overall, we paid for 4 people about $350 w/o a bottle of wine or anything like that. If we only paid $150-$200 I could have been still OK but at this price range I expect high quality services to be delivered. Really disappointed in LAVO, never coming back and never sending any of my friends there. Sorry, Palazzo.",

The DJ was okay but not memorable. Service was very good and very friendly.  What we ordered- KOBE BEEF MEATBALLS and SPAGHETTI: Delicious. Really great. The meatballs were soft and flavorful. Sauce was thick and hearty. The whipped fresh ricotta really pushed it over the edge too.  MARGHERITA PIZZA: This was better than expected. Nothing too great, but definitely good. My only complaint was that it had a lot of crust. So I hope you like crust if you order this.   GARLIC BREAD: Complimentary. Very garlicky and delicious, but a little too toasted. Almost impossible to chew.  WINE: I ordered a glass of prosecco which was delicious.   DESSERT: Skipped it but menu looked good.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT: The tables are so close together that the waiters can barely move. They have obviously tried to make the most of the small space and it shows. I think they could stand to lose about 1/4 of the tables in the place in order to give patrons a fighting chance in case of fire or flood. ;)",

We had the kobe meatball as an appetizer and it was the best meatball I've ever had.  The garlic bread was amazing.  All of our pasta dishes and the carne pizze were very good.  They even brought out a tiramisu as a birthday desert for my fiance.  The decor was beautiful inside - we ate outside overlooking the strip and got to watch the treasure island show from our table.    They also give you a stamp to come back to the nightclub for free - which is worth a lot in Vegas.  We did come back for the club but it was way too crowded to hang out.  We waited at the bar for 5 minutes before going back down the restaurant bar to get drinks.  We went back up to dance but it was just too crowded to stay.  I think you definitely need a table on a saturday night to have a good time here.  It reminded me of Tao since there were women washing each other in a bathtub.  Overall - dinner was amazing but the club would only get 2 stars for me.",

I love catching up on all the gossip mags and I have noticed a lot of hype for Lavo Restaurant and Nightclub so I knew that was my next destination. If the celebs go there I want to be there as well!!    One of my girlfriends was having her birthday dinner at Lavo so I was very excited to try out their food.  I was stunned at the amazing decor and ambiance of the place.  The pictures that are posted do not do it justice.  Its AMAZING!   I love the vibe dining feel with the DJ spinning great tunes and the buzz of the Lounge/Restaurant itself.  We all grabbed a drink at the bar before our dinner reservation and I was impressed by their speciality cocktail menu.  I tried two drinks and highly suggest the Uva Bianco (white grape vodka martini) and the Lavolini (passion fruit style bellini) YUM!  The bar staff was very friendly and its hard to find that in Vegas.    The menu was amazing! Everything sounded so good it was hard to decide.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable with the menu and their extensive wine list.  We had some Vino and some really great food.  I highly suggest everything we ate: Calamari Kobe Beef Carpaccio Ricotta Stuffed Meatballs Veal Melenase Chicken Parm Chilean Sea Bass Oreo Zeppole for desert! Apple Cristata YUMMMMMMMMMY!  You better believe I was tasting everyone's dishes.  The portions were very generous vs. the pricing of the dishes.  I am all about value :)  After our amazing dinner we went up to the nightclub to check that out.    I love that this nightclub is more like a boutique style nightclub. I really do not like the huge monster clubs so this had a nice intimate vibe.  The bartenders were very attentive, fast, and attractive.  Its nice to see smiles on the faces of your bartenders! As for drink prices, very standard for Vegas if not a bit cheaper than some of the bigger clubs.  For all of you that are upset at the cost of drinks, Welcome to VEGAS!! Its like this all over the strip so ask prices before ordering to save yourself the shock.  Other venues charge $20 a drink!   All in all, we had an amazing time with amazing service and I will totally come back to Lavo.  A+++++  to the service, staff, and management.  Thank you Tao group for another great concept!",

    "text": "If you want some amazing Italian food on the strip with a view Lavo is it!  The service and food were amazing!  First, you have to start off with \"The Meatball\" which is a 16 ounces of Fresh Ground Imperial Wagyu, Italian Sausage and Veal. Served with Fresh Whipped Ricotta.  I am telling you this is amazing with all the seasonings playing together then you get the creaminess of the Ricotta.  Next level Meatball.  Then for pastas I could not just pick one so I got two.  Haha.  The first pasta dish was the Cavatelli Bolognese which is Sausage Bolognese Sauce, and Fresh Ricotta.  Once again amazing flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  The second dish in my opinion is the best pasta dish and that was Spaghetti Carbonara which is Pancetta, Prosciutto, Bacon, Onions, Light Cream Sauce.  This is one of the best pasta dishes I have had.  You get the creaminess of the sauce then the saltiness of the bacon with the Pancetta.  This was the money dish.  For dessert we had the 20 Layer Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake which is devils food cake, peanut butter mascarpone.  This cake was massive!  The devils food cake was super moist.  So, moist you can set the fork on the cake and the fork will just sink and cut you your own piece.  Then you get the richness of the chocolate mixed with the creamy peanut butter that just melts in your mouth.  Amazing, moist, very rich cake.  You will not finish it.  I do recommend that you sit outside on the patio where it is a better view and more intimate.   The only knock I have for Lavo is that it is very loud inside the restaurant and you cannot hear the person next to you talk.  They do have big portions but this is not a family style Italian style restaurant.  Highly recommend.  BrandonFitFoodie",

The waiter was extremely professional and friendly, as it should be in a place like this.  They offer a variety of fancy cocktails and drinks. Me being a simple guy, opted for the classic jack and coke. Drinks came in pretty fast and seemed to always be refilled on time.   Ordered the Wagyu meatballs as an appetizer and they were delicious. A little pricey, but worth it. Most of the dishes here are served family style, which means the portions are big enough for everyone to split and share and dig in. No complaints here though, as doing so helps everyone split the check and get to try different kinds of selections from the menu.",

We arrived at 1:30pm and waited on the long line for people on a guest list. The REDUCED cover for guys was $40 and at 1:30pm LAVO looked packed! As I got my bag checked I was told I wasn't allowed in with my GoPro. I was confused and asked why. The guy who checked my bag said they don't allow cameras like that inside and I'd have to check it in with the bell desk. I tried to check it in but since we weren't staying at the Palazzo they could not check it in for us. I told the guy and he said I can't go in with it, I'd have to bring it to my hotel room or car. We stayed at the Luxor which is on the opposite side of the strip. I have NEVER been denied to go to a club for such a ridiculous reason. Don't people take pictures and videos on their phones? The same thing a GoPro does? I forgot I had my GoPro in my bag. Had I known I wasn't going to be allowed in with it I would've left it back. I would've never paid for a cab to go to the Palazzo, get denied, go ALL THE WAY BACK to the Luxor, drop off my GoPro then go back to LAVO. I'm very upset with how I was treated and there were no accommodations made. If you plan on going be careful with what you bring - they might not let you in because you have a phone that takes pictures and videos!",

    "text": "Went to Lavo for dinner last night for my 30th birthday and had a wonderful time. Erin was an amazing server. She was very kind and fun, and gave us great food recommendations.  I have been to Lavo once before also for my birthday. A lot of my friends got the spicy lobster bisque that time and they passed it around because it was so good everyone had to try it. I got it last night and it did not disappoint. It has nice chunks of lobster in it and a very light spicy flavor. Sometimes lobster bisque just tastes like a bowl of butter but this had a lot of flavor.  For an entree I got the spaghetti and wagyu beef meatballs. OMG mouth watering. Also insanely filling... or maybe that was all the garlic bread I gorged myself on.  The meatballs are of course delicious, the pasta is perfectly al dente, the marinara sauce is the perfect mix of flavor, and then as if that wasn't good enough, they put the smoothest ricotta I've ever had on top. Sometimes ricotta can overpower a fish, but this ricotta is the perfect complement.   You do get complimentary garlic bread with marinara.  The garlic butter was perfect and soaked all through the bread. The crust was chewy and yummy.  They also brought me a complimentary strawberry shortcake which was great.  I wish I had seen the check in offer because that dessert sounds even better!  I loved my drink. It was the Vecchio Stile which was an old fashioned with rum. The rum had a light, delicious flavor and there was just enough sweetness along with the bitters to make a delightfully flavorful drink, that wasn't sickeningly sweet and just smoky and smooth. Yum yum!   Lavo is one of my favorite Vegas restaurants in my favorite Vegas hotel... so I'll definitely be back!",

Great design throughout, even the bathrooms are gorgeous.  Came with a large group for Cathey K's birthday brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and portions after several lackluster Strip brunch experiences. Dishes are about ~$20/ea but portions are hearty and everything was well executed. The menu has several options from traditional griddle fare to Italian specialties and shareables. Neli T and I split the breakfast pizza (with scrambled egg and smoked salmon), the 16oz Wagyu meatball (still unfinished despite the table of ten!), and the Louie salad (with two small crab claws and tons of shrimp). Everything was super fresh and we had plenty of leftovers!   Service was at times spotty but they were fairly busy with several large groups- I recommend making a reservation, family-style meals are available with flexible rates. Their Yelp check-in special updates seasonally to allow for a free dessert, so don't forget to use your app.  NOTE: Though they're really pushing the Saturday Party Brunch, Sunday's \"regular brunch\" was a better choice for us. I come to brunch to catch up with friends and share some tasty dishes, not to dance on a table to ear-splitting EDM. But hey, if that's your thing...",

Our reservation was for a patio table, however since the only tables available were in full sun, it was decided to go for indoor seating in the dining room.  The dining room has a beautiful decor and soft lighting The room is very conversation friendly. Immediately after being seated we ordered water and cocktails. This was followed a complementary dish of garlic/butter bread with a bowl of red sauce.  Next our server Josue explained the menu and was helpful to determine our selection.. Many items are large portions that can easily be shared. We finally decided on sharing two items. The  meatball with sausage ragu is made from fresh ground Wagyu, Italian Sausage and Veal. Handcrafted with fresh herbs, imported cheeses and topped with whipped Ricotta. The meatball is 16 oz (yes 1 pound). The second item was a side order of Pene Pasta with tomato sauce. The meatball was cut into four pieces table side We managed to eat half of the meatball and half of the pasta. This left enough for a take home meal. The kitchen accommodated our request for extra pasta sauce.   Las Vegas has no shortage of great Italian restaurants and  Lavo certainly serves one of the best meatballs in town. Juicy and tender Waygu accompanied by a rich sauce.",

While it appears at first that Lavo is designed for larger groups, you can request a more intimate setting to celebrate your anniversary even on your first dates!  Keep it PG though!!  No \"smoochin\" on the first date!!    When it comes time to order, may I suggest their Fresh Whole Main Lobsters? It was mouthwatering and comes with butter sauce. My choice and favorite here would have to be their Chilean Sea Bass.  It was quite tasty and love that there was a bite of crunchiness to it.  Full of goodness!  And whatever you do, order their special grilled octopus. Man, it was so tasty that the tentacles slurped right in my mouth and even goes great with salad (see my photo). If you are considering steaks, definitely their Filet Mignon.  It was so tender and moist. For dessert, get their Mascarponne Panna Cota with Pineapple Anise sorbet.  Mmmm, mmmm good! It wasn't too sweet which was very refreshing.  Ambiance here is definitely primo.  It does get very loud and busy so you may need Ethel Merman's projecting voice to hear each other. But after a few of their New York State of Mind drinks which is a concoction of Knob Creek Rye Whiskey, that puppy will for sure send you to the moon and back, smiling and wanting a few more glasses thereafter!  Remember what they say, \"Everything Stays In Vegas.\"  PS - checkout my review with LAVO in NYC here (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?q=lavo&userid=yD1aRxezQ8XjrKogEfuShw\">yelp.com/user_details_re...</a>).

    "text": "Nice place for large group meetups.  As we did for a birthday brunch; Lavo is able to accommodate even 15 or more.  On our Sunday morning visit there were several tables with large groups.  Their dining space is like a luxury home's open area concept with a bar and lounge.  The walkway leading to the casino sports bar lounge is a centerpiece above the dining area, rather than in the middle of the room.  During brunch, menu items available are breakfast, lunch, and dinner type of meals.  There's a bottomless mimosa option and a pre-fixed menu at special pricing.  Ask about them if you dine here with a good sized group.  The food portions are average, EXCEPT their known-for 16oz. meatball.  The dinner size meatball is a ridiculous 32oz. meatball.  I dare you!  My choice was their Margarita Pizza.  I'm still on a hunt for the best flavored one.  No, this didn't meet the mark.  It was okay and I almost consumed it all.  My pizza wasn't hot.  The difference from others I've eaten was the oblong shape of the crust, which I think is common in Italy.  It was served on a flat board with a handle.  They spend time on food presentation which is something I would expect for this type of dining.  Table set-up appears semi-formal, but you can dine in casual attire.  We received good service for our large group.  Water and coffee refills.  Waiters checking on us.  Upstairs is a sports bar casino lounge, so casual is okay.  Interior decor has a lot of fusion going on for an Italian restaurant.  I saw influences from Asian or Mediterranean flare especially in the design of the shutters above, the pottery fountains, and what appeared to be a thin wooden curtain with candles.  Wasn't sure what to make of the different style chandeliers above.    Lavo really has a beautiful interior.  Let that at least invite you in.",

    "text": "Food The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either. I was in a group with ten people and we were told that it was a menu designed to be shared. Although most of my party opted for dishes such as Chilean sea bass, the meatball, the eggplant parmesan, and the chicken parmesan. However, I found it strange because the portions sizes didn't allow for all of us to share. Then a few of us opted for the pasta, like the chicken agnolotti, penne seafood alfredo, and the carbonara. I personally had the agnolotti and it wasn't bad, but the fontina was a little too overpowering. The texture was crumbly and I didn't mind it but I tried searching for the taste of the wild mushrooms and sage. The sauce with the agnolotti was sort of sweet which helped to cut through the cheesy taste. The other two pasta dishes were also heavy due to the creamy nature of their sauces, and they weren't bad either. Although the main dishes felt as if they were missing the overall 'wow' factor. I should've mentioned this earlier, but the appetizers like the complimentary garlic bread and antipasto, the Caesar salad, and the calamari were all pretty standard tasting. The only real redemption of the entire meal had been the tiramisu, it was moist but not to the point where it fell apart. It also had tiny dark chocolate malt balls for texture and overall it was the best-tasting thing I've had in the entire meal. We even did the Yelp check-in, and we were limited at one oreo zeppole per table. I understand why they limit it (and I shouldn't complain because it is free), but we were a party of ten so I wished they would've allowed us at least two of them.   Service Our dinner reservation was at nine, which I understand it pretty late and people get tired. But for the price and location, I expected a lot more. Our waiter, who didn't even bother telling us his name, was older and he just wasn't approachable. I felt as if every table touch was forced and uncomfortable. The other servers who helped seemed more approachable and significantly better than the one we were assigned.   Ambiance The interior is dimly lit and gives off a classy but not uber classy look. The design was cool and I really loved the bathrooms (which even had an attendant), however, the music didn't completely fit in with the image. It was cool to see a live DJ, but the pop music with the image of the restaurant was just a little off.  Overall, I wouldn't go again. It was a nice to know what a dining experience would be at LAVO, but with the okay-ish food and the not so great service. For the price points given, I'd rather go to another restaurant.",

The drink menu is large and creative- drink prices are very fair. They're famous for their meatball... but I'm vegan so I couldn't tell you about it. They bring out antipasto and garlic bread with sauce as house starters. I split a beet salad with no cheese with someone and it was INCREDIBLE. Who ever has fond memories/ cravings for a salad?! (Me). The spaghetti with red sauce is vegan, and some side dishes. I ordered mixed mushrooms, and garlic spinach with my spaghetti. The mushrooms were very good, the spinach was boring and oily. I'm giving 3 stars because there seems to be no thought in the vegetarian option... I always feel strange paying stupid money for one serving of spaghetti and sauce.",

The focaccia and side sauce was a nice complementary side dish, but should be served warm (it was cold).

I sat at the bar which isn't something I typically prefer, but it was the best option on a crowded night. The full menu is available and the bar tenders were very kind. Aware of a the patrons and excellent at timing their visits. I enjoyed the Chicken Parm, side of pasta and garlic bread. All very delicious and worth the 2 mile walk from my hotel.  My first visit was with colleagues and we enjoyed the meatball app, eggplant parm app and different entrees. If you've never been, you have to try the meatball. This will probably always be my go to place when I'm not sure what I want. Reliably delicious and a nice but casual atmosphere.",

We received free garlic bread (delicious) before our food came, we ordered fries and wild mushrooms as we mostly came for dessert. The fries were good, nothing too special, but the mushrooms were fantastic! They were perfectly soft and mouth watering mixed in with olive oil. I then realized we could get a free Oreo Zeppole for checking in to yelp, so I did. I checked the menu and thought I saw it say the Zeppole is a milkshake, my mistake. So, mistakenly I ordered the strawberry shortcake with our free Zeppole. When they both came we knew I'd misunderstood...the Zeppole was much bigger than I thought! It included 6 hush puppy sized balls with a cup of ice cream to dip them into. They were so DELICIOUS! They taste like funnel cakes with soft Oreo sweetness inside, they went perfectly with the ice cream. We finished the Zeppole and had to take our entire strawberry shortcake home with us. I was very surprised Lavo gave such a tasty and large dessert to customers for free. This is probably the most delicious dessert I've gotten free from a restaurant by checking in on yelp. Try Lavo out, you will not be disappointed, I promise! I will definitely be paying them another visit.",

We were in Vegas during restaurant week and 4 out of the 5 of us ordered off the pre-fixe menu. We shared one of the kobe beef meatballs with ricotta and tomato sauce to start. This was amazing!! Served in a mini cast-iron skillet and served piping hot. Gah. Amazing. We were also served fresh garlic bread, right out of the oven. One of the best starts to a meal I've probably ever had. We also had a bottle of Malbec which really set off all the rich dishes.   For my pre fixe menu, I had the arancini, penne ala vodka, and strawberry shortcake. Unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't quite live up the start, but everything was still fantastic. Arancini was soft and fluffly, and penne had a great vodka sauce (penne was a little al dente in my opinion). I only had a couple bites of my dessert since I was so full at that point, but that was also wonderful.   Service was absolutely fantastic. We had several different waiters buzzing around us throughout the course of the meal clearing plates, filling water, and checking on us. Our server was super friendly and outgoing- even bumped my mom out of the bad mood she was in. Wonderful Italian on the strip!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to dine at while in Vegas. Since my husband and I usually stay at the Palazzo Hotel it's very convenient to grab a late night bite before heading back to the room. The restaurant is very elegant with dim lighting and several beautiful chandeliers throughout. I always order the signature meatball, which is the size of a small child's head, and the veal parmigiana, which is also plentiful. The entrees are a bit pricey, but everything in Vegas tends to be, so the large portions are a plus compared to other restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 12 people.  We forgot to make reservations but they were able to accommodate us at such short notice.    I ate here twice for dinner and  I can now say that I am not a fan of their food.    The first time I came here I had raw oysters (which I enjoyed- then again I love raw oysters) and their rigatoni sausage pasta dish.  I felt that it was a pretty \"heavy\" choice of a meal since we were going out afterwards.  In Italian cuisine, the sauce is what makes the dish,  their tomato sauce lacked a lot of flavor.  This dish tasted like the pastas you can order at the Italian fast food joints located in shopping centers/malls.  The second time I came here, I had the roasted chillean sea bass and it was okay.  The portabello mushrooms were over powering the flavor of the dish..unless it were meant to be the \"main\" flavor.     The pasta portions are pretty huge, so if you're going to get a pasta dish, you should probably split that with your friend/date.  Make sure you pay attention to your bill because they charge for garlic bread.  The waiter brings it out to your table, as if it were free, but it's not.   The seating is pretty close to each other. I feel like I can sit and hear the conversation of everyone around me. Excellent wait staff and Pinot Grigio.",

    "text": "I visited LAVO with a bunch of friends on our final night in Vegas. Maybe it was because we had just gone to Marquee the night before, but I left the locale pretty disappointed.  LAVO has a deal where you eat dinner at the restaurant, and then get free admission to the nightclub that evening (if it's open). It seemed like a pretty good deal, and since there were a few of us, we decided to jump on the deal.  Dinner: 1.5/5  We asked for the latest possible reservation so as to just head over to the club right after dinner and were given a 10:45pm table. On the way to the restaurant, we hit a little traffic in the cab and were running late. We called the restaurant to inform them, and they told us that we had a \"15 min grace period\" to get there. I found it hard to believe that we'd lose our table, especially since the restaurant wasn't exactly packed on this weeknight.   Anyway, we got there right in the nick of time and were seated right away. We ordered a variety of entrees, ranging from pasta to pizza. Average price was around $25. The waiter informed us that we'd have a \"better\" chance of getting comped at the club if we also ordered cocktails and appetizers. Since the hostess said that all we needed were entrees, we declined.  The food -   meh. Some of the portion sizes were downright comical, including one friend's ravioli, which we joked the waiter must have dropped on the way here, since there were only about 4 pieces of ravioli for a $24 plate.  No one was really \"wowed\" by the taste; in fact, I think the happiest of us were the ones that ordered the carne pizza ($24). It came on a long bread (think loaf of French bread as opposed to circular pizza). Not bad, but definitely not worth $24.  The ambiance was nice and the waiter was friendly enough. We paid and quickly went on to the nightclub  Nightclub: 2/5  The hostess had informed us that we would have to wait on line again for the club, but there was a separate, shorter line for dinner guests. She also said that we could just show our receipt and get our free admission into the club.  We went outside and waited on a short line (the general admission line was about 50 people long by that point). One of the men at the door decided to give us a hard time because we didn't have any stamps from the restaurant (which no one mentioned). He then asked to see our dinner receipt, and said that it would only be good for 2 people (even though we paid over $30/pp at dinner on a night when admission to the club was $20).  We didn't want to make a huge deal, so we went back to the restaurant, asked the hostess to stamp our wrists, and then got back on line. From here on, we had no more issues and were able to get inside with no cover.  Inside the club  The club is often advertised as an \"intimate\" club. I guess that's a nice way of saying \"small\".  In fairness, it's not exactly tiny, but after having visited Marquee the night before, the place felt like a watered down, smaller version of Marquee.   Music was almost exclusively electro/house.  The dance floor was decent, but not as lively as other places I've been to in LV. All in all, not very happening, even though the place was decently packed.  Downstairs  The downstairs bar was also open and had some music, but there were very few people down here. It made for a quick escape if you needed a drink (or wanted to smoke, as there was an adjacent outdoor patio section overlooking the strip).   In the end, we wound up leaving after about an hour. The decor was certainly very nice, but give me a fun place with average decor than a fancy, dry place any day.   Overall  I definitely would not bother eating here ever again, and the club itself was nothing to write home about.  Overall 1.5 out of 5, rounded up to 2 because the decor was nice  Pros  Very nice Decor Free entry to the club if you have an entree at dinner  Cons  Overpriced entrees Small portions Feels like a junior sized, watered down version of Marquee  Protips:   make sure to wear a collared, button down shirt at minimum for guys. They specifically said no polo shirts at the club (although I sported a blazer with a polo and was not given any problems)  make sure to get your hand stamped by the hostess before leaving dinner and going to the club in order to get free entry.",

The hostess did offer us a free round of drinks to compensate. We had the pomegranate limonata, which was made well. The restaurant does have a nice ambience upon entering, but looks much bigger than it really is. They had a DJ playing good music in the lounge area. Once we were finally seated, the restaurant manager came over to apologize for the wait. Luckily, the food was very good. We ordered tuna tartare, beef carpaccio, meatballs with ricotta, creamed spinach & a 12 oz steak, which was more than enough to split among three people. Service was great & attentive. Bathrooms were clean, but a little dark inside. We were able to access the nightclub after eating.  As for the nightclub, the music was horrible! It was rap all night. Not r&b that you could dance to, but rap that you couldn't understand the words with disgusting lyrics. The DJ did not know how to transition from one song to another. There was an older crowd there, so with it comes creeps. The comped drinks we had were not good on anything except beer and champagne. Not what I pictured the party scene to be after eating at such a trendy restaurant.",

I'm still confused why it's called a Brunch at 2PM, but whatever,  Everyone got in free, including dudes, if you have a good promoter. Only the bottom room is open where they have all the tables set up.   It was open bar for the girls as well from 2-3PM and the bartenders were not stingy about that AT ALL.  There's an indoor dining area, the bar, and an outdoor patio area.  They play loud club music with the windows drawn, but there's no dance floor if that's what you're looking for.   Inside seating is reserved for table service.  Outside is first come first serve.  Nice place to chill and get your (Free) drank on.    Crowd was kind of bougie looking to be honest, but then again, it is Vegas.  It was a nice pit stop before hitting up a buffet.",

    "text": "Hmm, the first time I came here to eat, I was very disappointed and did not enjoy my meal at all!  The food was bland and did not entice my taste buds.  Now the second time I came here, I came with my friend who was visiting Vegas for the weekend.  It was a late meal and we were both HUNGRY!  haha.  Walking around the strip, the restaurant Lavo caught my friend's eye and we looked at the menu and she wanted to dine there.  I was a bit hesitant, but since she was the guest, I complied and asked for a seat for two for dinner.    As we got the menu, we were trying to decide what to order.  We ended up decided to order family style.  This mean, 2 friends, 5 dishes, ranging from salad, appetizers, a main entree, and including dessert!  We ordered their famous meat ball with ricotta cheese, the truffle fries, a lobster scampi pizza, and a fish dish with a delicious crouton salad that I forgot the name of!    The meatball was actually really good!  I can see why everyone talks about it!  It is one full pound of wagyu beef (very tender beef)  cooked with lots of flavors and topped with marinara sauce and ricotta cheese.  Eating it by itself was a bit too salty, so I paired it with their complimentary garlic bread.  Both of use only had 1/4 of the ball since we wanted to try everything else.    When the truffle fries came out, it was DELICIOUS!  Now this is how fries are suppose to be!  Semi burnt! ;-)  Hahaha.  I loved burnt potatoes!  Not of those light gold colored fries you get at McD's, but the dark brown, crispy fries that has been in the fryer longer than it was suppose to be!  hahahaha.  Topped with parmasean cheese and truffle oil, my mouth was dancing in joy with each bit!    Next up, the Lobster scampi Pizza and the fish dish (which was not memorable besides the crouton salad it came with).  Now Lobster scampi on top of a flat bread pizza...need I say more?  It was DELICIOUS!  No complaints there!    As for the fish dish, It was okay...but the croutons side dish was so good!  I swear what they did was cubed bread, deep fried it to a crisp, tossed it was cucumbers and tomato and served it!  Simple yet amazing!    Last but not least...dessert....not I know Lavo is known for their deep fried oreos...but after hearing about its texture, I was not appeased to even try it!  The waiter basically told us it tasted like oreo dough...in my mind (oreo soaked in oil)  Ouch...heart attack!  So instead, we chose to order the toasted marshmellow 7 layer rolled cake....such a great decision because it was what we both were craving!  It was a thin layer of chocolate cake, rolled with a vanilla type of cream and covered with chocolate ganache.  Very sweet, but perfect ending to such a delicious meal!    Now I wasn't impressed with my first experience here, and after giving it a second chance, LAVO has won my taste buds!  I'd recommend my friends to come here, so you should come and try it too! =)",

He comped us 3 drinks & 3 desserts. Awesome. It's my 30th birthday after all. We sit and are greeted by a sharp waiter named Eric. He was attentive, friendly & caring. We all order the lobster bisque. Pasty. So we send it back. Next, we order 2 sea bass' and a Caesar salad. We received our food at 1030. Mind you, I have another reservation at 11 that we cannot be late for. Now we are rushing to eat, barely touched our drinks and weren't even offered a to-go box. I ask for the manger. A man named Leo approaches our table, explains that it is also his birthday, comes to no resolution and simply walks off. As if, my problem is no longer his concern. We felt disrespected and saddened by the situation. He didn't apologize. He only offered a poor solution to my problem. I felt that because we were a table of women, our problem didn't matter. Had my husband been sitting beside me, I'm sure Leo would have been more than accommodating. The server offered to bring him back over, I said yes although I was running very low on time. He never came. As we walked out, we saw him hiding behind a plant. Like I said, not his problem.   DO NOT EAT HERE. Especially if it's a special day. Spend it an establishment that cares about you and appreciates your business. I'm disgusted. Pick another restaurant!!!",

I wasn't there for that long cause I couldn't take the music but I only saw one bar which was extremely crowded. Around the bar were \"tables\" which was really just a booth style seating with no privacy because thats the only pathway to get around the bar.   Additionally, if I were dining in the restaurant I really wouldn't want people leaving and entering the nightclub to be walking above me with the chance of someone who had one too many sips of alcohol to hurl over the balcony when walking in or out of the club.",

    "text": "This was the first place we went to once we got to Vegas, our 9 pm dinner reservation meant we were starving.  Our table wasn't ready when we got there so we opted to get some cocktails, we were just going to go to the bar and get drinks (that's what we do in New Orleans), but a cocktail waitress took our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Forder.it&s=dd2a3d3bc4e5181189dd3b65e1f42a0ad869c228ea92c2a0599ba4f503838645\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">order.it</a> took 30 minutes for her to take our order, deliver the drinks, deliver the bills, and to never pick up the receipts. The hostess didn't want to sit us until our bills were picked up, but it was already 930 and they were threatening to give up our reservation.   We ended up walking over to our table with your drinks and checks in hand.  The bread and sauce appetizer that is given to the table was delicious (first is free, second was round is charged.)  I opted for the chicken parmigiana with a side of pasta (the portion is so big you do not need the pasta).  The chicken was thinly pounded and THE SIZE OF MY FACE! Seriously, iced never seen such a large chicken! I was able to eat about half (my cousin ate the second half later) and took a few bites from my cousins meatballs and spaghetti and Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge - I wish we would have tried the meatball.",

The restaurant was fairly empty and had just opened, so I would have appreciated a bit faster and more frequent service (it took a couple of asks to get salt--which wasn't on the table and was instead served in a small shot glass with a spoon--and a side of bacon).",

It came out well done.  My waiter saw it and ordered another.  It tasted fine although either the burger or the fries had an over abundance of truffle oil on them, it mustve been on sale.  ANYWAY, I returned to my hotel room within about an hour and started feeling ill.  the feeling got much worse.  After several hours of pain and other things I finally started feeling better.  I tried calling the restaurant to warn about the meat but after calling 3 times and being put on hold for at least 10 minutes each time after asking for a manager I gave up.  Customer service doesn't seem to be their strong suit, neither does their food.  I can understand bad food, but not food that will make you sick.  STAY AWAY.",

The gnocchi had an okay flavor, but I think it was mostly that it was served cold and we were all so hungry that I just didn't say anything.  The others at my table got a nice steak, three cheese ravioli, and spaghetti and meatballs. They all loved their meals.  Major positive: if you check in here you get a free strawberry shortcake dessert. The dessert was delicious.",

The kitchen delivered 10 of the 12 entrees at the same time, brought the 11th a few minutes later and then completely forgot about the 12th.  Of course we were comp'd the 12th meal, and we were given a free dessert, but this was inexcusable for a nearly $900 meal.  In other visits, we've had perfectly excellent service, but the atmosphere is not for everyone.  Sure, there's beautiful people waiting on you; but it can be relatively loud so take that into consideration.    The food is very good - some of the dishes (like the meatball) are amazing.  Lots of drinks to choose from as well.  Be sure to get reservations ahead of time.  Arrive early, have a drink and don't expect to get seated until the whole group is here.",

We had a table of 7 and of the entrees we tried our top 3 favorites were the comfort food ones. 1. Truffled Mac and cheese was a hit and a must order. 2. Chicken and waffles are a classic but yummy and 3. Back to school or grilled cheese with tomato soup. Side note- they serve croissant and a berry bread and it was delicious!   Again all of these items may not seem spectacular but it was the taste that sold us. For example we had a beautiful order of Nutella and Banana Crepes and it was good but not great. Beautiful for pictures though. Same with the classic Benedict. It was pretty and nice but simple.   The staff was actually fantastic and really took great care of us. This options were very good and I liked the variety they had. I had a hard time choosing. Definitely a nice spot for brunch.",

I personally loved the sea bass! I'm from California, so I've had fish  and I can be hard to please. They had an excellent wine list with interesting selections. I can't say enough positive things about the service which of course creates the experience and influences your memories. My daughter was treated very special and very respectfully. Before serving her the complimentary \"blow job\" shot, the waiter spoke to my husband on the side to find out how he would like this handled. They served her w/o naming it. She had a great time and enjoyed the experience so much. If you're concerned about cost, it wasn't bad for nine adults (eight drinking), our bill was $645 not including the tip. So, for nine entrees, drinks, dessert and phenomenal service that's well worth it!",

And of course, the food was savory, and the waiters were too. After eating at the restaurant, we moseyed upstairs to the club.  AS FOR THE CLUB: it's not \"kind of small\", it's hella small! For sure it's small, what the hell. Some would call it \"intimate\", and I would disagree. The crowd was rough, people were pushing, and it was impossible to dance, which sucked, because the DJ was actually spinning great music...and I wanted to dance! In my opinion, they should've stopped admitting people into the club, it was just too sweaty, rowdy, and gross.  However, I won't completely shortchange LAVO, it has an open bar till 11PM, and still honored it 10-15 minutes passed the hour. And its interior design/decor is nice, I vaguely remember fountains, seashell mosaic artwork, and lots of cream and cerulean blue colors. I also won't overlook that we met some nice fellas that bought us two rounds of drinks, either. Needless to say, we left after only being there 35 minutes because my friend was about to get in a fight with a guy, my friend's a girl. We're classy ladies, what can I say.",

I went there Saturday night and had no problem getting the reservation on Thursday, even though I overheard the hostesses telling people trying to get in that they had been reserved for months.    So my review is for the restaurant only.  It is a trendy, beautiful place.  The ceilings are very high and magnificent.  I am not sure about the glass upstairs with bathroom sinks in view?  Especially when the bathrooms are on the first floor.  This being Vegas, of course there was that exciting vibe going on.  The food is fantastic.  Of course everyone knows about the huge yummy meatballs, but they really are delicious and perfect.  We also had several other items we loved including the pizza, pasta with vodka sauce and green beans.  The green beans were even exceptionally delicious.  It was my son's birthday so we even got the fried oreos and I know it would be hard for that not to be good, but they went to the trouble of writing happy birthday in chocolate on the plate which was nice.  The only real issue I had was with the hostess stand.  When we went in, there were several people in line.  I noticed that with 5 people standing at the hostess stand, they didn't even greet anyone.  It was funny that right after I mentioned that, one of the other people in our party came up and said the same thing to me.  When we were greeted, we were handed a pager and told to wait in the bar.  Even though we had a reservation they didn't give us a wait time.  It wasn't bad, only about 15 or 20 minutes.  However, we noticed that there were a LOT of empty tables in the restaurant and realized they were doing it on purpose to create the demand.  I know this is common in Vegas, but I prefer a restaurant that cares more about their customers than their image. Our service was great once we were seated.  Our server was delightful and attentive.  However, we were sitting right next to a bus station and it was loud with banging right behind my head several times.  At one point during the dinner, the bussers came in a broke down a round table to a square and were banging around and not being careful not to disrupt the diners.    So, it is what it is.  It is Vegas.  It is beautiful and trendy, but also with surprisingly delicious food.  I am torn between 4 and 5 stars, but I am going with 4 because I think more attention should be paid to the diners to make it a 5 star restaurant.  I was contacted by the restaurant to come back, although they never followed up with anything.  I went back and it was much better, so I have changed my review to 5 stars.  I went on a night that was very quiet in Vegas so they were almost empty.  That might have made a difference.  We will find out next time.",

In addition, no fresh parmesan cheese (no cheese for that matter). 3.  Food was very salty - 2 of the 6 meals in our party were almost inedible. 4.  Loud, obnoxious club music playing throughout the patio for evening dinner.  I'm all about partying and the Vegas vibe but playing it on the patio at dinner just really ruins the atmosphere.

The service was terrible -- our waiter, who reminded us of Joran van der Sloot, spent most of his time flirting with a table of young women rather than attending to his customers.  Thankfully a fellow waiter took pity on us and brought us water and drinks.  The electronica dance music was way too loud and sounded more like a rave party than a restaurant.  We won't be back.",

We got to our Table and it was located in the corner by the upper bar which I actually prefer.  Our cocktail waitress was amazing all night!  She was super nice, made good/strong drinks and made sure crowd control was a high priority.  The two tables on either side of us decided to pack in about 20 people on a 2 bottle minimum and management picked up on this.  They quickly rectified the situation and it was back to comfy seating after that.  I have been to many clubs and have never seen them act so quick when someone is trying to exploit their table agreement.  (2 bottle min for 6-7 guests and then 20 people show up at the table after they have been seated)   This alone will assure future business from me.",

Although, the downside was that my friends weren't on and had to pay cover. The line was already long and I had noticed there wasn't a line for guestlist so what I did was walk up to one of the \"hosts\" and asked them about if I had to wait in the line and he was really cool and said we could cut the line since I was guestlisted.  Okay so what you people really care about: yes, the club is very very tight (as in small) and you have to go up A LOT of stairs just to get there. I don't even know where the men's bathroom is. It isn't obvious, I'll tell ya that!. Music was alright, at times it got a bit repetitive and old but picked up. Thank god Wayne Brady was there to catch our attention while the crap music was playing. Good crowd but super small dance floor.  Notes: Cover on a Sunday: 20 bucks (free if you guestlist). Pretty crowded despite it being a Sunday night. Just talk to the dudes at the door. The one I talked with was pretty cool. You just gotta talk to the right one (and no I did not slip him a bill or two.) So there are decent and good bouncers out there! Good Music, good looking chicks, Happy Fella.",

The good part is that we got in fairly quickly...didn't have to wait in line or pay (helps to be an all-girl group).  The bad part however...  We stayed mainly in the lounge area and not really the club part, but for a lounge they sure make it hard to get a drink!  We were standing around the bar area for a while, and finally got a drink after some guy offered to get us drinks (thanks random guy!).  When I went back to get some more, the bartender basically ignored me and filled all of the servers' orders first.  I got tired of waiting and went back to our seats but servers were nowhere to be found to take our order either.  Finally saw one of those chicks selling cocktails and got 3 shooters for 6 bucks each, they were pretty bad, but at least we got some alcohol in our system.  Finally left since we were bored, I was nowhere near buzzed, and my friend was getting hungry.  I probably won't go back to this place...with or without the girls.",

    "text": "I've been to Lavo twice. First time was a Friday night back in April. We got the hookup so we didn't pay to get in. The music was bumping and I loved that they played some dirty south hip hop for a while. Since it was crowded and the dance floor is tiny, we just stood and did a little bounce and two step.   Second time was on a Saturday night after partying at Tao. We got in free but instead of heading to the upstairs club, we hung out at the downstairs lounge. There were plenty of seats and as long as you ordered drinks, you could sit anywhere. The music downstairs was good, chill but something you could still dance to if you wanted. You could even go to the outside patio where there were couches and views of the strip.  I like the concept of the restaurant/loung/nightclub and the decor is nice. It's supposed to mimi a Greek bathhouse. If the dancefloor upstairs was a little bigger it would be nice. -1 star for the psuedo-lesbian girls dry humping on display for the guys. Instead of go-go dancers, Lavo has these girls dressed up like Greek concubines who pretend to be all lesbionic with eachother. If you're going to do all that, at least LOOK like you enjoy it. Most of the girls look bored. At least get real lesbians. I'm just saying..",

    "text": "This review is for the restaurant, not the club. After talking to our concierge at Encore, we decided to try Lavo. It was 7:45 and she said she'd call over for an 8:00 reservation, which I didn't think was necessary on a Thursday night, but I'm glad she did. When we showed up, the place was 75% full, and by 9:00, it was packed. The dining room is very cool - dark and sexy, with thumping house music, as you'd expect from a restaurant/nightclub from the TAO people. Service was just okay - our server seemed bummed when we told her we weren't having any drinks, and when we told her we needed a couple more minutes to look at the menu, she disappeared for about 20 minutes. She got nicer as the night went on, though. We shared the baked clams oreganato to start. At the same time, they brought out an entire loaf of garlic bread with marinara sauce to dip. We noticed that they always wait to bring this complimentary garlic bread until after you order - probably because it's HUGE and you'd order way less if you knew you were getting this. The clams and garlic bread were very good. Then we had the caprese salad, which was very nice, although personally I could have done without the green tomatoes. For entrees, we split the veal milanese and the pasta with vodka sauce. The veal was just okay, but the pasta was delicious. Word of warning: the portions here are ENORMOUS. We overheard the waiter telling another couple that when Ludovic Lefebvre was chef and they served Mediterranean small plates, people were all complaining about the tiny portions. So now they so overcompensated with these obscenely ginormous portions that it's really wasteful. They should tell you about the portion sizes before you order. We left over half the veal uneaten. So just know, if you dine here, that one app or salad and one entree are perfectly enough for two to share. Prices are reasonable to begin with, but when you see the portions and that you could share, it really becomes quite inexpensive. For good but not exceptional Italian in a very hip vibe, head to Lavo (especially if you want access to the club, which I hear is quite nice).",

    "text": "Lavo is absolutely fantastic for happy hour or dinner. They lounge and dining area are gorgeous, service is perfect, and the food and drinks are relatively decently priced for Vegas and absolutely delicious. The club on the other hand, it's ok. We were there on a Sunday, which is still a good party night in Vegas (every night is, basically). The club opens around 11pm, pretty standard, and at 11 the line was already out the door of the Palazzo. We had VIP admission and line passes, so it was pretty sweet to skip the line and not have to pay admission. The club was awesome earlier on in the night when it wasn't too crowded. Issues: they let way too many people in so that the club was overcrowded and even the walkways/hallways were packed; the tables are below knee level, and not blocked off by anything (other than ropes), so when it gets crowded it's way too easy to be knocked over one; bartenders are rude and inconsiderate. A member of our party started having trouble breathing (probably related to the strong smell of vomit coming from the mens bathroom next to one of the bars), and the bartender (girl) wouldn't give her a glass of water--just completely ignored her. Our friend was hyperventilating pretty obviously. So we had to grab one of the crowd control guys to help us, and escort us out because the crowd was too thick to get through. Last issue: the DJ was horrible. He played random music that wasn't good to dance to, and changed the song every minute as if it was a power-hour mix. People were literally standing around confused at various points in time.",

The Chicken Parmesan was a large portion, definitely worth the value and was seasoned to perfection. Great flavor. They also had a really good blueberry cocktail that I recommend! The dessert...

My suggestion is park in the Palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into Lavo. They do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nights.   After three weeks of low carbing, pasta was the only thing on my mind. With a plethora of Italian restaurants off the strip, out of all the reviews, Lavo seemed to fit.  I chose to sit out on the patio, despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93F outside. With EDM playing in the background and the glimmering lights from the strip, it gives Lavo a very trendy feel.    They start you off with complimentary garlic bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm. Paired with a red dipping sauce, it melted in my mouth. What was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once I began to devour the little bites of heaven.   On to the entree. Spaghetti carbonara had my name or should I say my stomach written all over it.  The plate looks deceptively small but once you dig in to the mound of pasta, you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion. The spaghetti carbonara did not disappoint. It was rich in flavor and solid meal all around. It's not the best I have had but considering the location and the ambiance, Lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.    I finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but wow, what a surprise. It wasn't overpowering or too sweet. It had all the warm elements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste. I had had gone into carb heaven a almost went comatose.   If you are looking for a trendy Italian Las Vegas hot spot, Lavo will not disappoint.",

    "text": "I made reservations here expecting to have a great dinner. It wasn't terrible, but you can do much better in Vegas. Our steaks were properly cooked based on what we ordered, but somehow both were dry. It was the first rare but dry filet mignon I've ever had. The steak serving situation was bizarre. The steaks came with a lemon (?), and entire head of roasted garlic (!), and a small dish of what I initially thought would be some type of Demi glace or a wine reduction but turned out to be A1 or Heinz 57 (!!!!!!!!!!).  Yes, they automatically serve the steak with a big ole helping of steak sauce.  They messed up our entrees but we still ate them because they didn't need to be remade for the small issue (wrong toppings on both steaks).  Without telling us, they comped us two desserts, neither of which we wanted nor did we eat aside from one bite of each. The fried Oreos were...not good. The tiramisu was also very odd in texture and full of mini chocolate chips. I wouldn't have been happy with either had I paid for them. The best items of the evenings were the drinks, which were well made and well thought out, and the roasted beet salad which 100% delivered on the beets and goat cheese.",

Their oysters are always spot on and come with tiny bottles of hot sauce with is cool lol. Their drinks are great and handcrafted as well as they have some very good wine. I want to say the meatball is around 23 bucks or something so if you had a couple drinks and the meatball you could get out of here for less than 50$ per person which is vegas is pretty cheap and the atmosphere is def upscale. If your feeling groggy afterwards you can go upstairs to the night club where they have a bar, dance floor and a few tables at which I took around 1700 from them at. lol definitely try them out. You won't be disappointed and it's def a place worth visiting more than once",

Slightly unfair for me to fully rate as we came full and all I could order was the burrata appetizer but it wasn't good-way too soggy as the tomatoes and burrata were drenched in an oil/balsamic mixture that made it taste like it had been sitting too long. Reminded me of when you try to save a salad that was dressed and go to eat it the next day and its completely soggy and inedible. The others I were with did not like their steak. My husbands meatball was HUGE and I can see why they are known for these but he said it did not compare to the ones he had earlier at Buddy V's and he's Italian after all so he knows his meatballs.",

My faves:  Branzino panzanella (light, delicious tastes combine in your mouth with small branzino fillets), Spaghetti and Kobe meatballs (seriously, if you could only eat one dish here, this is it), and then the ribeye, which is done northern Italian style, and oh-so good. You can trust these guys to do a good job on your meat.   Don't go without a reservation, and be prepared to wait in the seating area an extra hour if you're dining on the late side, but they do make nice cocktails, so enjoy!  There's a club upstairs if you're so inclined.   Best casual restaurant in Vegas.",

Sure the decor is kind of unique with the sinks lining the pathway in.. sure it's nice to see such lovely female scenery on the stairs as you enter the club.. and of course, it's always nice when the ladies in your group get hooked up with free alcohol and pass on to the guys..  BUT DAMN.. none of that can make up for the amount of DICKERY that the security guards have when corralling you and suffocating you on the tiny dance floor.. Seriously, we couldn't stand anywhere, unless of course it was in the mass of sweaty, stinking, rhythmically challenged bodies.. To top it off, they played the typical top 40 hits with nothing else really worthwhile..  And on top of that, I had to fork over 20 hard earned dollars.. whaaaat??",

    "text": "I see Lavo as the \"it\" place to be in Vegas..super exclusive, and totally worth it..... Ok, so Lavo means to bathe or cleanse, and after a night here, that is just what you will have to do, in a good way. The restaurant is GORGEOUS! From the Moroccan tables, twenty foot ceilings, and the glass/wood screen bridge that leads to the club...they knew what they were doing when they designed this place.  Honestly, this place is beautiful, and it of course doesn't hurt to have Grecian beauties bathing themselves in copper tubs, extremely hot waiters, and cocktail waitresses in short little dresses with AMAZING shoes! The restaurant...where do I begin? Since the girls and I were enjoying a \"girl dinner,\" aka a free dinner because we are hot, we never saw a menu and our waited just brought out food he thought we'd enjoy. So I'll try and describe is as best I can. First came the amuse bouche-deconstructed bloody mary shots....ummm....HELLO DELICIOUS! Tomato sorbet, vodka gelatin, and celery foam.....really, out of this world, if i could eat 12 more....I would Margarita pizza- ok, I thought it was delicious, and so did the girls, but I probly would opt to order the other things first next time... Salmon with black caviar..OMG!!! Order it, my mouth is still watering Borccolini...garlic goodness, excellent side dish PROSCIUTTO FIG PANINI WITH HONEY!!!! I cannot begin to express how wonderful this was, we literally licked the dish....the combination of the salty prosciutto, the sweet lavender honey, and the fig just take you to food orgasm....ORDER THREE!!!! Sadly, we did have a noodle dish and a white fish that I can't remember, but they were good, just not AMAZING The food here was Delicious, and from the other reviews, who orders sliders at a restaurant like this?   The Club has A LOT of stairs going up to it....and on the way up you are greeted by multiple bouncers, fat women being fanned by midgets, and bathing goddesses. Once you enter the club, which is on the small side, so I see it being VERY exclusive, you are greeted by a gorgeous circular bar. There are tables around the dance floor, and one table that is against the wall which has like towel rings on it, so you can stand up on the seats and hold onto the wall while you dance....ummm....GREAT foresight!!! The dancing girls add just what I like in my clubs, and on one more note, the bathroom has a holder for your drink!!!! This place is amazing, it's not very crowded yet, but once word spreads, this place is going to be fantastic.",

    "text": "Sister's 21st bday in Vegas so i looked for the hot spot to take her to dinner and she said italian so LAVO popped up first. Made reservations on a Saturday night and we were seated right away when we arrived. Nice decor, dark and very loud music just a hip modern atmosphere to get our night started. Our server was prompt and we started with drinks, now don't ask me to name them off their cocktail list I cant remember the weird italian names but they were good. Unfortunately later on the music was so loud my server heard something completely different and brought the wrong drink but it was good and drinkable, she even offered to comp it and bring the correct one but I didn't mind. For appetizers we ordered the oysters and the evenings  special squash blossoms, they arrived quickly and before that we ate some of their delicious garlic read so yummy! The oysters were delicious and fresh but when they came out we thought they were trying to jip us since there were 3 large and 3 extra small so we brought it to our servers attention and she informed us they were different types of oysters ooooooh.... ok we get it now but I dont remember that description in the menu. The squash blossoms were disappointing, heavily deep fried and bland, when i heard it was drizzled with honey truffle I thought they would be amazing but i wouldn't recommend them. For our entrees I asked our server which was more popular the penne with seafood or spaghetti carbonara...she picked the spaghetti and man it was incredible! Highly recommend this dish, cannot get it out of my mind my mouth salivates thinking about it. My sister had the shrimp linguine special which was ok not as flavorful as the carbonara, my friend ordered the seabass which I thought for the price, I've had much better for much less. Should have tried the meatballs that everyone talks about, in my reservation i wrote celebrating my sisters birthday and again in front of our server said \" lets start with the birthday girl!\" so I was disappointed when we did not receive the bday dessert I've read about and maybe I should directly asked but I didn't want to be annoying. Enjoyed our evening never rushed like at Tao and service from hostess to server was good also.",

    "text": "This is a review for Lavo as a nightclub:  Sooo we basically snuck into Lavo via the door closest to the front desk of the Palazzo lobby. I'm not sure how or why there was no bouncer at the door, but wooohoooooo for no cover! I'd stopped by here in the daytime for drinks before on previous visits to Vegas, but this past trip was my 1st time coming to indulge in its nightlife scene. Bottomline is that we got what we were looking for, loved the decor + had a good time, but I'll probably try other nighttime hotspots on the strip before coming back again. Check out my photos of the place!   =)  Location - It's on the right side from the front doors of the Palazzo, across from the front desk. Easy to find + so there's no need to wind around the casino searching for it. If you're walking to it from the strip, there's outer awnings with LAVO printed right on it.   Parking - As with every casino, Palazzo has it's own free multi-level garage at the back. They have an entrance from Las Vegas Blvd or on Sands Ave.   Venue - A bit on the smaller side but very nicely themed dark, Mediterranean decor. Downstairs there's a full bar w/ an ample seating lounge area of couches + cushions. Then upstairs you'll pass by some decorative urns as well as a hallway of water basins that actually have running water in them. This leads to even more stairs (thank goodness for handrails...), at the top of which is another bar + finally the dance floor. This bar has more comfy seating around the wall + is far enough away to have a decent conversation away from the music. The dance floor is on the small side + is surrounded by the special reserved tables. The bouncers try to barricade the tables from the floor by using those velvet ropes, which only leads to people running into them because the dance floor is so packed... not very efficient. There's a stage at the back wall of the floor + a slightly tacky disco ball that hangs on the ceiling above it.   Cleanliness - No problems here, but then again it's so dark that it would have been difficult to tell anyways. At one point in the night I did see employees wiping a spilled drink at the edge of the dance floor, but other than that, I take this as a good sign.   Crowd - We went on a weekday so the only part of the club that was packed was the dance floor, where everyone seemed to be having a good time. The crowd was young + fairly diverse on multiple levels. Not too many older or creepy people.   Music - They played different music downstairs + upstairs, the latter of which was a bit too much on the loud side for my taste. Anytime where it's kinda difficult to have a conversation with a friend right next to me can't be good for the ear drums. It was your typical top-40's music, danceable but not too memorable for being either awesome or bad... just loud.  Bar - As previously mentioned, there 2 large bars: 1 upstairs + 1 downstairs. As it wasn't too crowded on this weeknight, there was no problem getting the attention of the bartenders, who were quick + attractive as well as attentive. During our last round of drinks, I asked for mine on the lighter side + the bartender complied while saying that she added extra into my friend's drink to be fair. Nicely done; she got a good tip.   Drinks - This is Vegas so of course the drinks are expensive. Everything we ordered was about $10-$15 before tip, but the drinks were stiff + as mentioned, they came quickly.    Bathroom - I'm not sure about the downstairs, but there is a nice bathroom upstairs between the walkway of the dance floor + the bar. The bouncers stand around there + flash their flashlights to clear the area so you don't have to fight the crowd to do what you gotta do.  Price - Cover on the weeknight we went is $20, but since we snuck in, we paid nada, muahaha. If you stay at the Palazzo, you get complimentary entry into Lavo as well. There is also a guestlist, which can get you in free, but you have to either know a promoter or get friendly with a bouncer. The club is open until the wee hours around 4am, but they stop letting people in soon after midnight.",

Also many sinks to wash your hands in from the entrance of the club to the bathroom ..no im not kidding....that is all",

    "text": "Lavo's Vice Sunday was easily the best night of the trip for me.  After a long weekend we were all ready to indulge one last time and Lavo provided the perfect atmosphere for that.  We managed to have a table for the entire night, I'm still not sure how bottles kept appearing, but it was a blast.  The music was the perfect balance of old school, hip hop, and current jams.  Lavo tops the list for me because it was laid-back, lacked pretense, and was filled with people genuinely enjoying Sunday Funday in Sin City.",

    "text": "(This review is for the club)  I happened to be in Vegas on a weekend when there was a boxing match taking place, maybe that contributed to the crowds. If possible, get one of those club-hopper passes so that you can also get into Tao if you're into having a really long night.   By the time we arrived the place was hopping! Awesome music, and if I had it to do all over again I would have worn some more comfortable shoes. For some reason there seems to be a Vegas sisterhood between all those brides-to-be running around in their little veils. It's kind of cute.   Do whatever you can call in a favor to get on the VIP list because I felt really bad for all the sorry well-dressed suckers waiting in line outside.",

    "text": "I know that Lavo sits in a 5 Star Resort, and Maybe thats why I expected something awesome. But Seriously we ordered the Chicken Parm. and it was awful. The Calamary was good but not great, luckily the Tirmisu saved dinner from being a complete fail but 4.00 for DRIP Coffee is rediculous. Add in 12.00 for a shot of Baileys and you have a 20.00 disaster. This is a 6.00 drink at best.   We spent 2 days at the Palazzo and for convience we found ourselves at Lavo both nights. The first evening in the nightclub was much better than the 2nd (especially since we never made it into the club). Observations from the first night: The feather dusting girls on a chaise lounge act is cheesy; the girls look bored. Ladies with wristbands can get free drinks but you should take a paying male customer to the counter with you for faster service. The DJ was decent and the club was crowded. It was a fun enough experience that we did want to return the second night.    The second night we ate at the restaurant and the consierge at the hotel made reservations and added us to the nightclub guest list. We were told that the wait staff in the restaurant would take us straight upstairs after our meal. This was NOT the case. In fact the waitress had no idea how to actually pull this off. She sent us out the door and the bouncers outside Lavo tried to thrust us into the general wait line.  We stopped to discuss our options just out the front door and were quite rudely told to move along and keep the corridor clear. I asked the bouncer at that time why do you have a guest list if you aren't going to stick to it. I was told pretty flatly that the wait list just keeps growing and growing and then you end up with the line that we see. So we moved down somewhat and again the man continued to rudely shove us toward the lobby. At which point I was frustrated with the treatment I was receiving. At a 5-star hotel where room rates range from 250-500 a night I expect a certain level of royal treatment.  As I turned to explain that I was a guest of the hotel, we'd just had dinner at Lavo's restaurant and had been told doing so would gaurantee entry into the nightclub.  He wasn't kind or apologetic, he simply stated that the consierge was half right, and that I would still need to provide proof that I'd eaten in the restaurant with my reciept or a wrist stamp as proof. So, now I've been called a liar as well. He never asked for a name on the reservation nor did he try to accomodate our party.   In my frustration I decided not to patronize the establishment and I walked away, evening ruined.  I won't be back.  You can be treated like this at any hotel, so I'll pay less and get more somewhere else.",

We stayed at the Palazzo so getting in was cake. Some friends stayed at another hotel and found getting in pretty easy as well. We have promoter friends though, so I don't know how it would be for the general population. I think one of the main reasons this club isn't so 'hot' is because it's smaller than other clubs. It has a lounge vibe, which is cool. It's just not somewhere to go pop bottle and hook up with models. However, it's a good place to pregame.",

I'm a fan of Chef Lefebvre - 1st tried his food at the L'orangerie and then i thought he really took it to a new level at Bastide ( though i preferred Chef Giraud's food at Bastide - why can't any restaurant succeed on Melrose Place ?!?! )   I figured his creativity would blossom in Vegas - hmmm, after tonight's meal i'm not sure.   The roomie and I enjoyed the restaurant design - nice to see the fireworks across the street at TI , too.   Tried a pomegranate lemonade at the bar ( $13 ) - waaay too sweet !   ordered baked clams, caprese salad, the crudo plate ( a Mediterranean sashimi plate ? ) to start. The clams had too much breading and salt, the broth was tasty. The caprese salad - the tomatoes were delicious, the cheese did little to improve the dish and the basil ? what basil - a lone fried leaf in the center of the plate - why ? The crudo -ok, did not care for the salmon but the filet was nice.   main entree - roomie had the paella. i went with the sliders, the lamb quesadilla and we shared the wild mushroom pizette.   The paella - loved the rice, the seafood was a little dry, the chicken tasted old and the chorizo ? it actually tasted more like pepperoni !   the lamb quesadilla's ? Are you sure it was lamb ? The sliders - bread a little old and way too much sauce. The pizette - the mushrooms were great , a tad too much salt, but overall, full of flavor.  We shared the chocolate bread pudding with the leche sauce ( caramel ) and vanilla bean ice cream. the ice cream and sauce were very good. The chocolate bread pudding - looked like two french toast sticks with chocolate chips in them - decent taste but i had a hard time calling it \"bread pudding . \"   I came in with high expectations. Left a little disappointed since i've had some amazing meals created by this Chef. I feel obligated to try this place again.",

    "text": "On our \"Girls NIght Out\", we came to Lavo for dinner.  We weren't sure where to go for dinner, so Jeff, from VIP Red Carpet, suggested Lavo and we werent disappointed.  Its located at the Palazzo, a short walk from the Mirage.  The decor was pretty cool.  It was pretty dim inside, but I really liked their chandeliers and lighting.  Anywho, we started with 2 of the tuna tartare and 1 caesar salad, which was more than enough to split amongst us 4 girls.  The caesar was pretty good, and the croutons were HUGE!  The tuna tartare wasn't that great for me...maybe im just used to Fusion, but I was expecting some kind of chip to go with it, and I didnt really like the lemony taste it had.  Next, they brought out some amazing garlic bread that you can dip in marinara sauce...pretty yummy.  They also brought out a pitcher of Saggio (kind of like a blueberry mojito)...they suggested the pitcher because it was cheaper than ordering individually...that probably lasted 1.5-2 rounds for us.  I really liked it...it was very light and summery. Perfect for those hot summer Vegas nights!  For my entree, I went with my favorite fish, the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by a breaded/fried portobello. Man was that good. I was a little upset that I was getting full and couldnt finish it.  It was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was great.  My friends ordered the grilled swordfish, the penne ala vodka, and the filet...no complaints from any of them.   Keep in mind that you have to order trimmings and potatoes separately for $10 each.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, and another friend ordered the roasted potatoes.  Its pretty huge, so you can probably split with the table.  I actually could've done without it, it was a little dry and I didnt want to waste whatever room was left in my tummy, on potatoes.  Last, but DEFINITELY not least....DESSERT!!!  We ordered deep fried battered oreos with a side of milkshake to dip them into.  PURE HEAVEN!!! It was so good...now im starting to drool again...lol.  This is definitely a cool place to check out for dinner.  The outside patio has an awesome view of the strip.  The ambience is great, the staff was friendly and they offered a ton of great suggestions.  They also knew we were in kind of a rush, so they happily accomodated.  I would definitely go back again.",

Right next to the check/checkout area and straight across the casino floor if you're coming from the hotel rooms, Lavo seems like it was designed for the tourists.  We went there around 11... the walkway to the actual club reminded me of Tao.  It was pretty empty at first.  In less than an hour though, it filled up quick!  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were pretty friendly and quick.  We never had to wait long to order.  The setup was a little frustrating.  Everything was compact so it seemed like we were always waiting in line whenever we wanted to go anywhere.  All-in-all the club was decent, but we only stayed a couple hours before going elsewhere.",

We were walk-ins at about 6pm with a toddler and they were more than accommodating.   Many of the dishes including the Caesar salad and desserts are family size which we were unaware of so we had plenty of food!   The pomegranate lemonade was an excellent cocktail as was the Ill Bello!   The Caesar salad was the best I have ever had in my life! It had a good amount garlic (maybe to strong for someone who doesn't like a good kick in the pants!) It was so good everyone at our table agreed that we could just keep eating that and cancel the rest of our orders.   The 4-cheese pizza I got for my daughter was fabulous, as was the Salmon that I shared with my Sister-in-law.   Dessert was to die for!!  There was an Apple pie with cinnamon ice cream that was fantastic and the chocolate cake was divine!  We can't wait to go back for more!",

Certainly not the case here. I am a Vegan, so I ordered the broccoli, it literally came out with two partial heads of broccoli (not cut up at all) needless to say I had to cut all of the pieces myself while my colleagues looked at the monster head of broccoli and just giggled. I will certainly pass on the broccoli in the future. The bread dipped in marinara was yummy- but again it's pasta- just pasta...nothing that special. Seriously the Olive Garden makes a marinara sauce that might even be better. I would never go back. It's not worth the money, the wait, the experience etc. Total waste of an evening in Vegas if you ask me.",

Bitchy bartender looked at us like we were stupid when I asked her a question about a cocktail and then when we were making small talk with her. It was apparent because we were over 30 we must be pretty lame and not worth her effort to be nice to. The tip she got reflected her attitude towards us. When we entered the dining room it was like entering another world. TOTALLY different atmosphere and service. The service was just right, waiter was funny, knowledgeable and attentive in the right amount,  food was wonderful, the best calamari I have had in some time, and enough for 4 or 5 people. Hubby and I both had basic pasta dishes which the portions were just right and the bread they kept us supplied with was Divine! Nice \"by the glass\" wine selection also with some affordable choices since hubby was drinking something harder that night. Atmosphere was dim lights and a warm setting and I'd recommend it for couples or groups. Not really a place for kids, tables were somewhat close together and it just wasn't a place to take kids. Parents have mercy on the couples trying to have a date night in Vegas and take your kiddos to Grand Lux.",

He also got really upset that his little rope barrier kept slowly moving outwards because the club was so full - mostly because he was pushing people into it as he went past.     Not sure if was some scam to get a bigger tip, but the barman decided that he wouldn't take the $2 bill that was part of my parent for drinks...   Of couse after it was politely pointed out that its legal currency and we could discuss with casnio management he backed down, but given that there are so many places with friendly staff and good service, why go back?",

    "text": "we went to the restaurant and the club, so i'll review both.   love, love, LOVED the restaurant!! i was a little nervous after reading all the reviews but we were so happy with everything. the decor is stunning. i went with a party of 4 girls and it was fantastic. we had reservations at 8, and they kept us waiting at the bar until 8:40 or so, so we got a free round of drinks - we'll take it. got sat and ordered a pretty cheap bottle of wine (for vegas especially). delicious garlic bread!! i ordered the tuna tartar - AMAZING!!! it had tuna and avocado with an amazing cilantro lime sauce. so refreshing and delish. then me and my friend split the salmon - herb crusted with some sort of zucchini salad. so yummy. my friends enjoyed their meals too - one ordered penne vodka and the other ordered... um... well i had a bottle of wine so i forgot. so yummy.   they came around and stamped our wrists and then we went outside to go upstairs. there was a long line but i guess we said the magic words because we were let into the club first. we could sit anywhere until that table was claimed, so we camped out at a sweet table for 2 hours til we decided to leave. the club became super packed and played pretty good music. i wasn't blown away by the club, but i think that had to with my company and not the club itself. loved the bathrooms. and loved the decor! 4 stars for you, lavo. i will definitely come back for that tartar.",

The hostesses will purposely wait to seat you. My friend and I overheard the ladies talking about not seating us right away because we were 10 minutes late. The hostesses claim we were 30 minutes late but it was only 10 minutes. They will also not seat you unless your entire party is there. And I mean the entire party even if they are sitting at the bar. You must be absolutely ready to be seated or they will NOT seat you. It's unfortunate that the whole entire experience was not pleasant but most of it was.",

    "text": "I am leaving 1 star because 0 stars is not an option. I went to Lavo last weekend for my best friend's bachelorette party in Vegas, and unfortunately Lavo was the absolute low point of the whole weekend, solely because of their crappy customer service. We had a table reservation for bottle service, we arrived on time, and somehow they had messed up our reservation - we were supposed to have 1 hosted bottle and were promised the table for the night although I had indicated that we would probably buy a second bottle. When we got there they demanded a credit card and said there would be no hosted bottle to start. We said we only wanted to buy one bottle then, but they insisted there was a 2-bottle minimum. It is extremely common for a large group of girls to get 2-for-1 bottle service in Vegas, as I have done it many times, so this was already BS, but I didn't want to make a scene and stress out the bachelorette so we just told them to call us when our table was ready and in the meantime they handed us a few free drink tickets for the trouble (geez thanks, that totally makes up for it - NOT). We went upstairs to order 8 vodka sodas, drink tickets in hand, and they asked what kind of vodka, I shrugged and said 'Ketel's fine'. When she brought over 8 drinks and I'm about to hand her the drink tickets when I discovered they only gave us 6 tickets - again, thanks hostess for not even giving us one drink per person, Geez...No big deal I will pay for 2 drinks, I hand her my credit card and the 6 tickets. The bartender then proceeds to tell me these tickets are only valid for well vodka, not premium vodka. Umm you saw them in my hand and knew we were using them so why ask me what kind of vodka we want??? I asked to see one of the tickets and kindly showed her that NOWHERE on the ticket did it say ANYTHING about any specific vodka types or any order limitations whatsoever. In California this would be a breach of contract but apparently in Vegas where the house always wins, it didn't really matter. I asked to see the manager and the manager gave me the same incredible attitude. I said nevermind then can I please have 8 \"well vodkas\" and left the \"Ketels\" on the bar. They refused to make us new drinks and would not give me back my credit card unless I paid more than $80 for all 8 drinks. Ridiculous. At the same time, downstairs called me to tell us our table was ready - fine I will deal with this later. I go downstairs to get our table but now they can't give us the table without my credit card to hold it - ahhh! That's upstairs being held hostage! I hadn't stashed any more cards into my little clutch so I had to go back upstairs to reason with the idiot bartenders who were probably the rudest staff people I have ever experienced in my life. I just asked for the bill (for the 8 drinks which had been left on the bar and were now cleared off so we technically didn't even get the merchandise I had to pay for!!!) and when I opened it my credit card wasn't there. I asked them where it was and they were literally holding it away from me until I signed the bill!! Unbelievably disrespectful and rude!! I asked her to give me my credit card so my friend could run down and register our table while I settled the bill but they refused. The B**tchy bartender just stood there with a smirk on her face saying \"no honey, not till you sign your bill and pay what you owe!\" Ummm is that even legal?? Anyways I tipped her fat *ss zero dollars (although keep in mind I literally paid over $80 for 8 drinks which not one of us ever touched, and I had 6 free drink tickets in my clutch!!), and she pretty much threw my credit card across the bar at me. I really was being way calmer and more reasonable that anyone would have been because I didn't want to upset the bachelorette or make her feel bad but after all that, I decided there was no way in hell I was giving this SH&&Y club $2000 for bottle service. It was small, crowded, loud, and the music was just ok at best. The crowd was terrible too. They should have been begging us to stay haha. It's frankly so old that it's not that cool anymore (I never really thought it was great to begin with)...So I gathered up my girls, called the 8 more on their way, and we all met at the club at Encore (XS) which was amazing! Avicii was playing and we got an awesome table in the center of the club where the guys next to us ended up sending us nice bottles of champagne all night and we danced on the table all night! Thank god the night was salvaged the second we left this disaster of a club they call LAVO. I will literally never be back and will tell everyone in Vegas how crappy they treated a customer willing to drop thousands and bring in 16 girls! Unbelievable...Oh the best part was they tried to add a mandatory 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more (which I found out when I got my credit card statement) but I called up Amex and called their bluff and they reversed the whole charge hahaha you lose LAVO!!!",

    "text": "This review is for the restaurant, not the nightclub.   Our second night in Vegas and I'm in the mood for some Italian. The first thing I thought of was Lavo, because I had heard they recently opened and are from the same people who brought us Tao. Wasn't really sure what to expect food-wise, but I figured we might as well try it.   First, the atmosphere: definitely a club first and a restaurant second. A DJ stood ready off to the side of the bar area, which was obviously going to be the dance floor once they got all the tables out of the way. The decor is like a combination of an old Mediterranean villa and a NYC nightclub. One thing that struck me as funny was what the waiters were wearing -- White shirt with an open collar, apron, and black suspenders. It looked like that scene in Godfather when Clemenza was teaching Michael how to make sauce, because everyone in the room was dressed like Clemenza. Anyway, on to the food...  Appetizer: I had a giant Caesar salad, which was really enough for two or three people. I only ate about a quarter of it, but it was good. My friend had their signature rice ball, stuffed with Kobe beef. I tried a little bit of it and it was absolutely superb. Ridiculously good.   Main Course: Rigatoni Melanzane (rigatoni pasta with eggplant). Pretty good, but nothing special. I've had the same type of dish at many other Italian places before, and, honestly, it's not the best I've ever had. But not the worst.  Dessert: Chocolate Bread Pudding. I can say without a doubt that this might be the best dessert I have ever had. Rich, thick bread pudding that looked almost like strips of French toast, infused with chocolate and drizzled with butterscotch. Wow. That dessert really made the whole dinner worthwhile.    So all in all, not the best Italian place I've ever been to, but the service was quick, the people were nice, and the decor was nice, if not a little amusing. Maybe next time I'll go back and see how the club is.",

    "text": "LAVO is just amazing from the food and drinks to the service. Well, let me explain.  DRINKS First we started at the bar while they were setting up out table, which was only a minute or so. Brittany was tending bar last night. She was super nice and she is a great mixologist. I'm not just saying that, but I tested her skills last night. Generally, if a place does not have my usual drink, Macallan 12, then I will either try a specialty cocktail or test the bartender. Last night, I ordered a Nuts and Berries shot. She knew what it was, but I asked her if she knew how to make it. She responding by asking if I wanted it made with Frangelico. She hit it right on the nose. It came out perfectly and just how I remember. Five stars for Brittany, her service and her mixology skills.  FOOD The food here is AMAZING! This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. My family and I love to eat good food, and the food here is to die for.   Appetizers - There are two things I always must have when I go to a restaurant that has them on the menu, and that is Charred Octopus and Lobster Bisque. Here, both are delicious and I highly recommend having at least one, if not both.   Main Entree - This first time I ever came here I had a Macadamia Crusted Sea Bass. It was FIRE and it literally got me hooked on this place. Even though is has not been on the menu since, everything I have had since has been spectacular. Last night, I had the Chicken Parm. I've included a picture so you can see what you are actually getting. As you can see, the portion sizes are huge, so plan to taking food home for lunch, because you are going to want to save room for dessert.   Dessert - So there are two things on the dessert menu that are just wonderful. Every time we come, I must have either the Fried Oreos or the 20 Layered Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake. Even though the latter is my favorite, they are both mouth watering and I highly recommend getting them. The cake is amazing even the next day. I will eat it for breakfast the following morning. As for the Oreos, they are not soggy like you would expect. It is more like a doughnut with a warm, crunchy Oreo inside. They are so good, and my mouth is watering just writing about them. Both desserts are a must have!  SERVICE Jo Jo was our server last night. She was excellent. She gave us the best customer service because she was so attentive, she knew anything about the menu, and she was very nice. When I'm in Vegas I drink a lot of water. I usually have to ask for a refill at every restaurant. Not here, Jo Jo and her team were on top of it; my water was never empty. The food came out in courses. First we had our appetizers. Our food did not come out until we were done with our appetizers. That is one thing I hate, when you are in the middle of eating an appetizer and your server is standing at your table with you meal. It makes you feel rushed. But, I digress. The food came out after we finished the appetizers and empty plates had been cleared away. This also was the case with the desserts. After our plates were taken away and leftovers packaged, then the dessert came out. Why can't all restaurants have service like LAVO?  MANAGEMENT Everything here runs like a well-oiled machine. Jason was the manager last night. He is very nice and will make sure you have a great experience. He came over a greeted us at the bar, and then came and chatted with us while we were at our table. He was also visiting other tables that I could see. This is a great management style because the manager is on the floor interacting with the guests and not just in the back or the kitchen.   CLEAN LAVO is always spotless! I never see anything on the floor. The silverware and glassware are always polished! There is nothing worse than getting a glass of wine or scotch and the glass being all spotted! Not at LAVO, every last detail is perfect.  CHECK IN  When I checked in last night, there was a free dessert coupon. It was for or Fried Oreos. As previously discussed, you know how much we love those.  Overall, the drinks, food, service, and management are amazing. It is clean and you get a free dessert when you check in. LAVO is amazing and I highly recommend everything.",

    "text": "I am pleased to report that on my most recent outing here with Diane and friends, everything was back to five-star level: five-star food, five-star service, and five-star ambiance as we sat outside at a table on the elevated patio facing Senor Frog's on the Las Vegas Strip.  Complimentary Garlic Bread was again juicy and superb, served alongside very nice Mediterranean Green Olives.  Crispy Fried Calamari was golden and delectable.  A Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail contained four elongated, very large, and tasty shrimps.  And I enjoyed a fine bowl of Vegetable Minestrone Soup packed with several fresh vegetables.  My main dish of simply grilled fish was a giant flattened Branzino perfectly seasoned and prepared in Olive Oil, accompanied by very good Crispy Truffle French Fries and good but hard Brussels Sprouts and well-cooked medium-sized Asparagus Spears.  Even the Jasmine Iced Tea was first-rate.  Service by multiple staffers was stellar.  Drinks were regularly refilled without request, and I was given a cloth napkin and soda water to help blot out food stains from dropped food on the front of my shirt, which has been a regular occurrence for me of late.  (At Nora's the next night I requested an extra cloth napkin, tucked it in at the neck, and Diane finally received a break from additional clothes washing on account of my recent spate of food spills.)  This was a memorable meal, and I will surely return to Lavo for another fine dinner, next time much sooner than in the past.",

Had called to book a table for 7:30 but they said they can only do 8:30. Fine, no big deal. We showed up at 8:20 and checked in only to be told that 'others guests haven't left yet' and it we will text you when ready. We waited for 45 MINUTES!! Despite having confirmed reservations for 8:30, didn't get to sit till 9:20 for dinner. Was beyond embarrassed in front of guests. They had over booked for the evening. When we finally ordered food, it took forever to arrive and we didn't actually get our meals till 10:30. They threw in some finger foods to make up to us but damage was done, guest left in a bad mood.   Jason Strauss needs to look into this.. food is okay but the the management and service levels are not worthy of the price you pay.",

    "text": "Normally I come to Vegas for the day parties at the pool but since pool season is over, we decided to try the Lavo Party Brunch. We all loved it! Even the people in our group who hate day parties had a great time.  Guys will have to pay cover (when we went it was $30 each). Make sure if a bouncer in line quotes you a price, you remember who you talked to. Because when we got to the front they tried to increase our cover and change it on us. But the cover is worth it if you have girls in your group to get drinks from the open bar.   I recommend coming early because the open bar is worth it. We probably got around 12-15 free drinks just in that one hour. Also, they give out free stuff like shot glasses, sunglasses, and hats. And when we went, they were giving free drink tastings at the front.  The patio outside is really nice and we got some great pictures in front of the flower wall. The inside eventually turns into a club with dancing once they start playing music and blocking out the windows. The DJ was great and overall it was a good party scene.  The only issue we had was the girls' bathroom. There were only 3-4 stalls and the line goes way out the door. Considering how many people are in this lounge, the line could take up to 45 min or more. We ended up leaving towards the end when we couldn't wait any longer, but probably would have stayed if there were more bathrooms because we were all having a great time.",

Ordered the carne pizza which wasn't burnt or cold. Perfectly cooked and filling! A little pricey but you're on vacation, so why not?   One notable thing that did happen was another customer had fallen down and had trouble getting up. They had an issue with their hip. My cousin and I helped this elderly woman and the manager thanked us and gave us a drink on the house! Very much appreciated, cheers!",

My group made a reservation for 8:15pm and checked at exactly that time with the front desk. After 15 minutes for our check-in, we went up again and asked how long the wait would be. They promised only a few more minutes and that they were cleaning our table as we spoke. Another 15 minutes went by and we once again went up to the front desk asking how the long the wait was, the manager said to take us back to our table but there were people fully sitting and eating... they took us back to the front. We told the front desk manager that if they did not have a table, we were going to leave. He said that it would be a few more minutes, so we left.",

    "text": "Disappointed:  My friend and I were very happy to get a reservation for 8pm at the prestigious Lavo restaurant. We were even more delighted that we were able to be seated 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, as we made it there in record time.  We happily sat in a wonderful out door setting overlooking the Palazzo fountain and sidewalk with gorgeous landscaping.  My friend, being an avid vegetarian, was delighted the truffle mushroom gnocchi was vegetarian. I was happy to order the Bolognese Rigatoni (sausage based sauce) with fresh ricotta.  Then the wait came. After approximately 15 min our delightful waitress Shani states it was taking a while while in the kitchen, and some fresh bread would be out shortly. 15 minutes later a salad to share was brought out by another person in the wait staff. Shortly after our waitress Shani came by and again apologized for the wait and stated the manager would come by shortly.  Another 17 minutes came by and our food finally came out. We were overjoyed to see our food and happily began eating it. Our waitress Shani, still gracious and polite, came by and again apologized for the wait stating the manager knew and would be by.  After our meal was completed, my friend and i decided we would not get dessert, despite the complimentary Yelp coupon. Then a minute or two later Shani came by stating she wanted to verify our allergies, and would bring something nice to the table.  Shortly after tiramisu with the inscription \"happy birthday\" came to our table.  Shani even gave us a candle, lit it and gave us a wink stating \"make a wish, it's your birthday\". A truly sweet gesture.  We shortly thereafter paid for our meals, and departed. I let the manager Timothy B (whom i asked for a manager at the front desk), that my friend and i considered walking out before our meal multiple times, but Shani was so wonderful that we stayed.  Timothy B did apologize and state he would pass along the information to the Chef. He also provided a business card while stating to please call him in the future.  Please note our bread never came. The manager, never did come to the table. We never did get asked if we wanted another or different cocktail.  The food was mediocre at best. Quality & texture were 2/5. Presentation was 3.5/5. Wait time & delay for food after ordering 0/5. Shani's service was by far the only thing going for this restaurant.  I will most definitely never go there again. I am thankful that the wait staff made a poor night, tolerable.",

I went here for my birthday and completely felt like I got my money's worth. It is $50 per person for buffet style brunch and an additional $25 for bottomless drinks (mimosas, rose, bloody mary, bloody maria, etc). SO WORTH IT! (especially the drinks). I tried the lobster fettucine, spaghetti, and caesar salad for my main dish but wish I tried their breakfast options. I think I felt somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of food on display lol. However, I did take advantage of their bottomless deal and tasted the bloody mary, rose, and mimosa. All food options tasted amazinggg, especially the pasta. Perfectly seasoned and still hot! For dessert, I only tried a couple of their small pastries andddd the chocolate fondue station with dipped strawberries. Let me tell you about the fondue station though!!! As a chocolate connoisseur, I can verify that it is, in fact, the best fondue I've had in a while. To top that off, my waitress even brought out my own complimentary tiramasu cake for my birthday. I took it easy on dessert since I brought my own birthday cake however, I definitely plan to take advantage of all stations the next time I visit Lavo's weekend brunch.",

The shrimps are dry and tough.... we did not taste the lobster or king crab legs. We spoke to the Manager, we want to return and cancel the order.... he told us that once the food on the table, we cannot return.  Of course we told him it's not acceptable... finally he removed the plate.  Our entrees and desserts were excellent.",

We ordered a bottle of wine and shared the Lobster Bisque, which was fantastic.  They pour the Bisque table side over the toasted bread and lobster meat.    My wife had a lobster and I had spaghetti and meatballs.  We shared a creamed spinach side.  She said it was the best lobster she's had....it's her go to for special occasions.  We utilized the yelp check in promo for a free desert and they brought us a second second desert for my birthday.  We finished with an espresso.    It was a very indulgent meal.  With tip it ended up being $215.  Expensive yes, but reasonable considering much of the check was wine.  You could have a great experience here for $80-$100 with tip.

Idk what the occasion was, but all the go-go dancers were dressed up like super heroes. Quite the experience.  I really wanted to go day clubbing in Vegas, but Marquee Dayclub Dome was closed this weekend and obviously pool parties aren't happening in the middle of January. This was a fun afternoon alternative before our night out! Thanks to our wonderful promoter, my friends and I (a group of 4 girls) were on the guest list and walked in for free with a very minimal wait.  Open bar for the ladies from 2-3 PM. Top 40's music. It was a little crowded with more tables than dance space, but hey free entry, free drinks, I'm not complaining. If you're looking for a place to sit and rest your feet, head upstairs (past the row of sinks, and up another set of stairs) to the ultra lounge. There's also quite a few TVs there so in between dancing and other merriment, it was the perfect spot to catch the Chiefs game!",

For dinner, my colleagues had the seafood linguine (not a bite left on his plate, the Bolognese (again, cleaned plate), and the seared yellowtail (which was delish!). I was in a weird combo mood and had the tuna stack appie and a baked potato (I warned you it was weird!). Both tasty. Also, they bring some killer garlic bread, also served with marinara, to the table - some of the best I have ever had! Finally, we shared a comp dessert, fried Oreos, compliments of a Yelp check in. Wow!  Our server, Ryan, was a rockstar in all categories. Funny, knowledgable and super friendly. Be sure to sit in his section. Also a shot out to all of his support team, refilling water glasses and delivering entrees.   -1 star for the noise factor, but we are in Vegas.   Try it!",

However, we were very disappointed. As brunch starts around noon, we were starving and excited for the amazing brunch food that is seen in all promo videos for the party. My group as well as many other guests attending soon realized an RSVP isn't going to get them the ability to eat. Since we were starving, we spent about 30 minutes there before dipping out. I get that it's a day club during those hours but it just seems silly to call it brunch and not be able to eat...",

A nightclub feel but still intimate and quiet enough to talk. At the advice of our very attentive waiter we split the chicken parm and seafood pasta. We also ordered the famous Waygu meatball, and it was huge! It was covered in sauce and super tender, but the taste of it did not wow me as much as the presentation. The chicken parm was huge and sooo good. Perfectly done! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! Covered in yummy cheese and just the perfect amount of sauce. The seafood pasta was probably my favorite. The sauce was to die for! So creamy and buttery I could have drank it with a straw! The Suggested Wine pairing was pretty perfect as well. Overall really yummy, good atmosphere, and great service. Money and time well spent. Oh and The tiramisu they brought out for my birthday was the icing on the cake!!! It was so good with its creamy chocolatey layers!! Yumm",

I've been to enough Vegas pool parties to know that I absolutely did not want to attend one for my bach.    Sin City's summer season ends late September/ early October when day clubs at the pools switch gears for day clubs located inside the casino hotels instead.  Namely at Palazzo's Lavo Restaurant and Lounge, the HOTTEST dance party held during the daytime!  My girls definitely know how to spoil me...decked out in all their beautiful blush tones for one of THE booziest brunches on the West Coast!  You know me and brunch honey...my favorite meal of the day! Add in some griddle faves, some greasy carbs, endless shots, bottomless champeezy and you've got yourself one helluva bash!  If you're ever wondering what's the haps in Vegas during winter, THIS IS IT!!!   Cannot wait to return before the season ends for another round at Lavo's Day Club Brunch! I'm sure I can wrestle up the posse for a repeat! ;D",

We had an assortment of menu items and from all appearances and grins ... pretty happy.  Portions were HUGE, but I guess this is Vegas.  I had the salmon and I thought it was quite good.  Excellent prep and ideal seasoning.  Very good flavor and not overcooked.  Al dente!  Drinks a plenty and attention to service was quite good considering the mob on a Tuesday.  Did I mention the waitresses were hot!  Again though, I guess it's Vegas and so they have to flaunt their clientele.  The nightclub upstairs is a quaint affair, but it's intimate enough without being overcrowded.  Liked it a lot and this night DJ Helena was on the scene.  Good fun til the wee hours.  Excellent bartending as well.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this one two combo of restaurant and nightclub.  P.S.  Did get picked up by a pro, but I guess this is Vegas...",

The promoter also promised the girls a Full Open Bar until 11:30pm, which was another huge incentive for us to come.  Right before we headed over there, the promoter apparently changed his mind and said that guys had to pay $30.  What the... not cool.  We hoped the free drinks would offset the cost, so we went anyway.  The Full Bar only consisted of basic drinks like vodka/tonic, rum/coke, redbull/vodka but nothing too fancy.  Oh well, it was good enough.  The dance floor is TINY, but we still had a lot of fun here!  Much more fun than we had at Tao.  We enjoyed the Deejay and the music he played.  Good times.",

BUT tonight my waiter had to be on DRUGS, he asked my friend to see her passport 3 times because he \"couldn't read the passport \" hopefully it's just because it's almost closing time but hes definitely off. Another issue I had was I ordered chicken parm (was sooooooooo good) but when I asked a passing waiter if the chicken parm came with pasta he said yes of course.... what do you think happened when the chicken came out? It was al a cart like I thought. Had to wait an extra 10 mins into my meal for my pasta side to arrive. Not the biggest problem but in a restaurant such as this you would think they would at least know their menu MISINFORMATION is kind of annoying when you have to wait   ... anyways hope next time will be better !!",

The meatball was fantastic and the garlic bread was also very tasty.  My entree was the crispy chicken which was weird because I was expecting it to be like a fried chicken plate but was pleasantly surprised to see it was grilled.  It came with potatoes and was very good.  They gave a pretty generous helping of chicken.  There weren't a ton of potatoes that came with it, but after finishing my entree I felt full and content.  No room for dessert, so I can't comment on their dessert offerings.    The price is high, but not too crazy for the ambiance and the portion sizes.  I was expecting to get less food than I did, but was pleasantly surprised.  The nightclub was a little small, but it was a fun time.  Apparently Jerry Rice was there, but I was too busy getting shot down by every woman on the face of the planet to notice that.",

That was our first issue, never go during the holidays because you'll pay 200% more for everything that time...even though it doesn't change from the weekend before or after. Well, maybe it will be less crowded.  Anyways, we were the first ones in line for the guestlist. Girls were free, guys cover was $60. All the boys sucked it up and paid that amount. Since we were some of the first people in there, we took full advantage of the open bar. We snagged some drinks for our guy friends as well.   Within the next hour, it got very crowded, since it is such a small venue. The music was a little outdated...early 2000's. We found a little spot between the VIP area and a walkway. It ended up getting way too crowded, that we decided to leave around 12-1230.  Like other people have said, it's a good place to start out at, but it's not a place that you'll stay all night at, unless you have a table and don't have to be smashed next to everyone else.",

My friend and I dined here on a Wednesday summer night, around 9 p.m. We got a table right away. Our waiter was extremely friendly, and pointed out that there were coupons in the Grazie book. (Inquire at the Venetian to join for free.) We decided to pass, since you essentially got two big bottles of wine, and we were only two people. But it seemed like a good deal, for Vegas.   I had the chicken and mushroom ravioli. It was in a garlic butter sauce with arugula on top. Holy cow! I only got 6 ravioli for something like $28, but won't soon forget it. The rav, and my friend's penne pasta, AND the garlic bread, were all delicious.  A few observations:  -The wait staff is all very attractive. -Our water was never below half full. -LAVO has a pretty romantic atmosphere.  -The place was decently crowded at that hour, but not packed. The nightclub didn't seem to be happening just yet.  If the prices were a LITTLE less expensive, and the portions a LITTLE larger, I would have given it five stars. However, (it's Vegas, and) as I mentioned, the flavors and service were terrific. So if you're looking for a fancy Italian meal on the Strip in Vegas, go here.",

    "text": "Lavo had quite a reputation to uphold.  Tao's European sister, it comes from the same creators of the restaurant which made the most revenue at one point out of all the restaurants at its level.  It's pretty difficult to find a stellar Italian restaurant, but Lavo comes close.  A client and I went there for dinner and we ordered a bit more dishes than we can handle because I didn't expect to come out of that restaurant with a full stomach.  This review is coming 3 months late, so bear with me.  The interior is pretty interesting.  It doesn't look like an Olive Garden (because Lavo is Sicilian based, I'll talk about this more later), and it really looks like.. a bathhouse.  The ceiling terrace is lined with Mediterranean-style bathtubs.  Moroccan lanterns fill the numerous alcoves that are located in the restaurants, and pots of water spill into small fountains in other places.  It feels as if you've been transported to Turkey itself.. if only the waiters were replaced with belly dancers wearing loincloths and sequins  I didn't remember much about the food, probably because I've eaten at other places where the establishment is very chef-driven.  Lavo seems to play its cards in the nightclub sector, so I understand its food not being up to par.  I remember ordering the carne pizza and the spaghetti with basil and tomatos, and they were both not bad.  They are worth the 20-something dollars, but I'm giving them only four stars because I definitely would like to see better food worth remembering.  Other than that, service was very nice.  Like I've said in a previous review, I like seeing a waitstaff that thoroughly knows their dishes.  Our waiter was able to describe to me that the restaurant specializes in Sicilian-style cuisine, meaning that they use more red sauces than white, and that makes sense because now that I think of it, I can't remember seeing anything pesto-based either.  You really can find better European food on the strip.  I can't write a review on Lavo based on its clubbing because I also know that there are much better clubs on the strip.    However, if you want decent Italian food, then this place will suffice.  If not, then go to Wynn's Bartolotta- Mediterranean food from the gods themselves.",

Waiters were friendly.  Since both time that I came was on the weekend and during dinner time, the atmosphere was dark (as if getting ready for a club) but was very noisy.  Eating outside would be better if you prefer the Las Vegas Blvd view; plus Treasure Island music and the occassional show.  I would recommend checking LV weather before deciding to sit outside.  One gripe I had was the additional waiting.  I still have to wait ANOTHER 30min even though I made a reservation.  However, reservation is still recommended; unless you come at and off-peak time or if the bar section has available seating.  Since I was a party of two, I felt they made us wait until a \"table for two\" was available and you felt cramp sitting next to other guests.  The worst part is seeing bigger groups of people just walk in and and grab seats before you.",

This place is fantastic if you Re ready for dinner and party immediately after. I went in hopes of a more romantic dinner but this music in the places EXTREMLY loud and apparently a dj comes in at 9:30 to play in the restaurant. So if your in the mood for a nice expensive dinner and a party come here! If your looking for a romantic dinner with superb service, skip this place. Our waitress was uninterested and more attentive to her larger tales, just rude (that's why the 3 stars)",

There is a winding stairway that takes you past a bunch of sinks with running water. I seriously thought it was a place for people to wash their hands or throw up. But I digress. After you pass the weird walkway of sinks, you have to keep walking up the stairs before you finally get to the club. When we arrived, the place was PACKED with people. We arrived around 10:45pm after we were unsuccessful at TAO.  TAO was even more ridiculously packed than LAVO.  The music here was really good. I enjoyed the music. But that was pretty much it.  The drinks here are approximately $13 each.  Good luck getting to the bar though. The bar was packed as well. We waited a good 20-30 minutes to get our drinks.  The dance floor was small. The perimeter of the dance floor is surrounded by people who reserved table service.  Unless you have a table, there is no where to sit inside Lavo.  After about an hour, we had to leave because there was no room on the dance floor.",

For appetizers had the four cheese pizza and fried calamari. The fried calamari was thick rings of delicious fried calamari goodness and the four cheese pizza had a crunchy thin crust that stood up to being lifted up without the toppings sliding off due to sogginess. The heirloom tomato burrata and pesto was delicious. The burrata was creamy, the tomatoes were fresh, and the pesto was fresh and a great compliment of taste to the burrata and the heirloom tomatoes. For the main course I had the NY strip steak that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The mixed wild mushrooms were full of earthy mushroomy flavor and a nice side to the NY strip steak. The polenta fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, nothing I would order again though. I also tried the imperial wagyu meatball with whipped ricotta. It was ok and didn't taste any different than a non-wagyu meatball, nothing impressive from my end. The ending to our meal came in the form of a strawberry shortcake, which was not too sweet and a good ratio of cake to cream to strawberries.     I would definitely come back to Lavo again as the ambiance is great along with the food.",

I ordered their chicken dish and it was so dry I had to chase it down with water to even swallow it. My wife ordered the Pena Ala Vodka and it was dry wife no sauce. Like it had been under a heat lamp for hours. Bottom line: Over rated. Dry food. Simply blows!",

No huge majestic staircase, no huge long winding corridors, just a simple layout with the bar, couches/ lounge chairs surrounding it, and a dance floor down a few steps.  Positives: you won't lose your friends in here!!  With regards to the open-bar drinks, I believe the best we could come up with was when we requested the bartender to make us something \"fruity & strong\".  I don't know what was in it, but it suited its name.  Also good here: pineapple + vodka, redbull + vodka, yes a lot of vodka...   The restroom attendant was very nice.  Made small talk, she was friendly, handed us a towel after we finished washing our hands, and recognized us as the night went on!  Well-maintained restroom that is VERY CLEAN!!!!  Sometimes hard to come by.  All the bartenders were nice, attentive, and NOT RUDE.  :)",

I believe he has a very easy job considering how terrible he is. Just select a playlist, hit play and keep his mouth shut. But apparently, that's just too hard for him or something. He would open his mouth every 5 seconds to shout out random words that nobody cared for. Yea, I know there are single ladies in the house; I'm dancing next to them. Stop interrupting the music and just let the music play!  Another thing DJ Reach could not do is transitioning from song to song. You know what he does when he wants to transition to the next song? AIR HORNs!!! What the hell? When he does that, it's annoying and it doesn't make any sense. Songs don't match up? Doesn't matter because DJ Reach has his AIR HORN sound mapped out on his keyboard. YAY! Here's a quote from Wikipedia: \"Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing, and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dancefloor.\" I should go to Wikipedia to remove \"beatmaching, phrasing, and slip-cueing\" and replace with \"AIR HORNing\".  Oh yeah, the club is too small for the amount of people they stuffed inside.  P.S. the night before, I had the pleasure of listening to DJ Jazzy Jeff over at club RAIN in the Palms. Now that's a freaking DJ!! Unlike this DJ Reach...blergh!!",

The bone in rib eye was tasty and cooked perfectly medium rare. The deep fried oreos were also really delicious.  Bad - any high end Italian restaurant that doesn't make all of their own pasta is a rip off. I wanted to order the chicken parm. It was around $29 and did not include pasta. What kind of Italian restaurant at any price point doesn't include pasta with chicken parm. When I asked what kind of pasta I could order as a side dish I was told it would be penne which was not homemade. I was also told the $29 plate of spag and meatballs does not have homemade pasta. I can boil noodles at home. I can get boiled dry noodles at olive garden or fazzolis or sbarro and feed the entire family for less than $30.  I only came here because it was on the company dime. I would feel totally ripped off if I was paying.",

Total incl gratuity: $?  Before starting the madness on industry night, we stopped by LAVO for a fairly light dinner.  We ordered an array of different appetizers, entrees, and desserts.   The wait was lengthy and unfortunately, the food and service were only mediocre. Considering the prices - averaging $20/appetizer and $30-$40/entrees, I think the food could have been a lot better.  I was more impressed with the appetizers than the actual entrees.  The beef carpaccio had nice flavor and was served with parmesan crisps, which was a nice touch.  The tuna tartare is worth ordering.  Fresh tuna with just the right pinch of citrus.  The pasta and lobster were both sub-par; they were both lacking in flavor.  Nothing that was worth paying premium prices for.  If you're big on desserts, try the deep-fried oreos. It sounds ridiculously fattening, and I'm sure they, however they are heavenly.  Little warm oreos deep fried in batter and served with vanilla ice cream.  Do I really need to say more?  Overall, LAVO is convenient and a great comfortable setting for getting together with friends, although don't come here expecting a magical culinary experience.",

    "text": "Lavo is the new nightclub/restaurant located in the Palazzo from the creators of Tao. It opens officially next weekend, but there appeared to be some form of a soft opening this weekend.   Restaurant: They are trying to be some sort of mediterranean fusion tapas place. All dishes are small and pricey ($7 for a slider, $15ish for a small tapas sized sih), and they don't offer any entree sized portions. We tried the kobe burger, fries, twice baked chicken, and a breaded veal dish. All were good, and the standout was the veal dish. Nothing was spectactular. Drinks were tasty and cost $12 each. Atmosphere seemed trendy, but contrived like everything in vegas! Servers in the main part were dressed like crap in jeans and tennis shoes but perhaps this was for the soft opening? We ate in the lounge part and the cocktail watiresses were hot and well dressed.   Nightclub: Even though they weren't even open yet officially and obviously weren't packed, they still made us go through the ridiculous fanfare of going through 6 bouncer checkpoints to get into the club. One guy told us \"You're lucky you came now when it's easy to get into... once we start advertising this place is going to get REALLY exclusive!\" Ok, ouch, so I'm that ugly that I'm not going to be able to get in once this place gets \"cool\".. mmmk whatever. Also they made my bf tuck in his button down shirt which I thought was weird.   Anyways, once we got into the nightclub I really didn't feel that impressed. I think Tryst is way better. Although the dancefloors seem to be similar sized, at Tryst you can dance all over the place.. this place was small and cramped outside the dance floor, so I think once this place fills up more the dance floor will get too full. The rest of the place is all VIP/bar area. The bar area was cramped and you definitely had no room to dance if you were standing anywhere but the dance floor. Seemed like it could get annoying.  Ok another issue I had.. so the theme is bathhouse. Kind of a fun/cool theme. HOWEVER they sucked at the decor. It's all black pretty much. There's a bizarre pseudo-sexual ugly painting in the back. There's towel rack handles on the wall in a weird pattern. At Tao they have all these cool bathtubs everywhere but then they build a place called a freaking bathhouse and have no such decor.. it's really odd. I mean the place was pretty and everything, I just wasn't blown away. Also, there's no outdoor part in the club part. There is a patio in the restaurant (however no service out there!), but once you get into the club there is no stepping outside.   Last but not least.. the music. Again, Tryst wins out. They played a lot of \"old\" songs, but not fun 70's/80's songs.. songs that were just well old. Like Nelly's \"ride with me\" or Gin and Juice by Snoop. Just lots of songs that are very \"tired\" but not classics if that makes sense. Either play trendy cool music, or play me some Bon Jovi.. none of this cool 10 years ago crap. Tryst had a nice mix of songs of the moment and 80's stuff. This DJ needs help.   Oh and one last complaint. So the line for this place is OUTSIDE. Yes, it is August and they are going to make you wait outside. We only waited 5 minutes due to the aforementioned emptiness, but if this place ever becomes cool and actually gets a line I would hate waiting outside for an hour + in extreme heat or even the \"extreme\" cold of the Vegas winter. EIther way , waiting outside blows and that was poor planning on their part.",

The restaurant is beautiful and the staff is awesome... The food however is HORRIBLE. Every single item we ordered was not only bad it was amateur cooking night at best. I started off with a basic salad which literally tasted like lettuce drenched in a vat of vinegar and red onion. It was so acidic I felt like my tongue had been rubbed on the carpet. I then ordered the buffalo mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes I literally could've gotten better quality at the local grocery store. I almost never salt my food and literally had to because it was bland and flavorless.  My husband ordered the Bone in filet mignon which had to be returned because it was so overcooked and dry we couldn't eat it. I ordered the vodka penne pasta which wasn't cooked at all however they left it under a heat lamp for several minutes so when it got brought out it was dry, and stuck together but somehow still not cooked. They were very sorry about the food and brought me a new plate however it was still not correct but I ate it anyways because I was starving. Sad that the $50 steak literally had no flavor and the bone was bigger than the meat. Whatever you do don't eat here you could sit enjoy the atmosphere and have a cocktail or glass of wine but do not order any food you'll be wasting your money.",

    "text": "LAVO is a stunning restaurant. It's one of those Las Vegas restaurants where the ambiance and atmosphere are equally as impressive as the food. I will say I'm a lover of Italian food in general, but I really enjoyed everything we ordered. My husband's mother is a simple eater in that she usually only orders a burger or pizza. She loved her margarita pizza, so that relieved my stress for the evening. I ordered the seafood pasta which was amazing. There was a lot of seafood, and the shrimp were huge. The sauce was spicy and very flavorful. My sister-in-law ordered the seafood alfredo, which was equally great. They sent a desert for my birthday which was a strawberry shortcake with biscuits serving as the \"cake\". The cream was perfect and berries were fresh. The service was timely and professional. It wasn't particularly warm or friendly service, but it was professional and quick. We were seated right away and our feed came out quickly. The prices are also very reasonably especially when you consider that you're in Las Vegas, dining at a big name restaurant, and for the portions and quality of the food served. Overall great experience.",

    "text": "oldie but goodie   There are very few places that are open on Sundays in vegas for clubbing. It was either Lavo, XS, Bank and Hakkassan. We chose Lavo because we've been there before and it's always a good time with my girls plus I don't like XS because we want to dance not sit by the pool; The Bank is just a pass; we had already gone to Hakkassan twice that weekend.   Lavo is a small venue but they play top 40/hip hop. They had a stretch in the middle where the DJ played some EDM but luckily it wasn't for too long. The crowd is usually pretty diverse but I think it's starting to get a little older like 30+. I will be honest and say, I don't think everyone who comes here will have as good of a time as we did because 1) we got bottle service 2) we were a bachelorette party of 11 crazy girls.   My promoter, Paul Burboa, hooked it up!!! He made sure our we got a good deal on bottle service! They seated us all the way in the very back by the bar....slightly disappointed but we made the best out of it. The liquor started flowing and so did the good times and lap dances =). Some of the girls were dancing on the platform behind our table and we started mingling with the tables next to ours.   We were soon approached and asked to relocate to a better table that was right behind the DJ. We had great views from our new table to enjoy the champagne shower contest. We ended up getting moved for a second time to fill an empty table that was right next to the dance floor! We didn't mind all the moving because we kept getting upgraded to better tables. After all that moving, the manager came over to thank us for being his best group that night!   The security guards were AWESOME! The club was packed so they made a pathway for us to make our way to the new tables. They stopped creepers from getting into our area. Some guy tipped our bouncer $2 to try to get into our bottle service, needless to say he stayed on the outside of the ropes LOL. I mentioned earlier that lap dances were going down and I guess they're not allowed in nightclubs so the bouncers would come over and tap us to stop. When we saw them coming, we already knew and just smiled like we weren't doing anything wrong. At the end of the night, they escorted us out of the club. Oh, I can't forget to mention, they had cute busboys too =)",

We had the pizza and calamari for appetizers, salad, Spaghetti, chicken Marsala, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and dessert. The dessert was just ok and I felt the calamari could have been more crispy, but other then that I thought the food tasted GREAT! The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was perfect for our bachelorette party and after dinner we were able to walk right into Tao's night club (Bring your dinner receipt). Well worth the money. I highly recommend it!!",

    "text": "(only for the nightclub)   Safe to say.... this Vegas local will never be back here again.   I may be biased as nightlife is not my thing, but I also still have enough knowledge to justly weigh the good and bad of things. I was really expecting good out of Lavo because the Palazzo is such a gorgeous and elegant hotel.  I was in a large party of 10+ girls and we were referred there by a promoter. I give props to him as he was very persistent, welcoming, and was working EXTREMELY hard. When we got into the restaurant part of Lavo I could see he was working on multiple tables of parties that he had obviously lured in to the club. He poured us one small cup of... citrus vodka... and juice?? And we were ushered out and up to the club.   The club entrance is not attractive in my opinion.  As Lavo does mean \"wash\" in Italian.. the theme is unattractive... running sinks & bathtubs. Plus, how can you feel clean and washed with a group of the scariest and most antiqued people I've seen all gathered into one big mess of a crowd.. I am not saying that the old(er) demographic should not get out and have fun, but this crowd looked like those who should understand life and alternate ways of fun.   Of course, the bartenders and hostesses were very attractive and eye-catching, as were the girls who were invited to sit at tables as we were. If you are looking to look at women, this would be a good spot to come... but I assure you there are an abundance of other places I would recommend before Lavo.   If you are looking to dance freely and have a little air to breathe, looking for a place that holds more adventure and a larger layout, and looking for somewhere to spend your entire night... go elsewhere.",

From the lighting, to the decor, to the people, to the loud bumping music. You walk in and you already feel lavish! When I walked in I bumped into David Spade! I couldnt help but take a double look when I saw him walking out of the restaurant.   They have the cutest fully stocked bar. With GOOD cocktails. And well their dinner menu is impeccable!  Try their fried oreos for dessert!  I assure that  YOU WILL DIE AND RESURRECT!!   Just a couple of FYI's If you want to have dinner there make a reservation! They get extremly busy for dinner! Also, if you have dinner at LAVO you get to go to their nightclub for FREEE!   NOW FOR THE NIGHTCLUB  I wasn't too impressed. The entrance leading to the club is rather intriguing. But the actual club is small and If you dont have a bottle you have no where to sit.  ASIDE from that good crowd, good music bumpin, and good times!",

But you know that going in to any trendy restaurant on the strip.  Definitely go for the Kobe Meatballs.  They are fantastic, definitely the best meatball I've ever had.  The calamari is good as well.  Our party had 3 pasta dishes and a prime filet.  All were very good.  Dessert was the 7 layer chocolate cake.  Anytime the wait staff mentions an item is shareable, believe them!  3-Stars cause it is Vegas strip expensive.  The meatballs make me want to give it a 4th star, but no.",

It was nicely decorated. But the place was too small. There were FREE drinks for females until 11pm, which is great. You have to tip the bartenders so they keep coming back to serve you.   A couple steps down is the dance floor. Trust me, this place is very, very, very small. It was packed with people when I went and maybe that's because of the small venue. It was really hard to dance and have fun with people next to you, at least shoulder apart.  If you're looking for a bigger dance floor with multiple bars, try going to TAO, XS, Marquee, etc.",

    "text": "Lavo is a smaller, less interesting Tao. At least our group got in with no cover charge. And there was open bar until midnight.  We went on Lavo's opening night (this past Saturday). Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes, Angie Harmon, Mario Lopez, and the Hilton twits were among the celeb appearances of Lavo's premiere. Let me just say that Jamie Foxx is an attention whore. Apparently he made an appearance at Tao the previous night, but when no one noticed him, he picked up a mic and sang along to one of his songs when the DJ played it. At Lavo, for literally about an hour, he perched atop the back of a seat at his booth texting/ emailing- probably himself- with his shades on. His bulldog was a rotund man who splayed his wide physique over Jamie in attempts to shield every flashing camera from the crowd (whatever Jamie, you live for it). Such devotion was promptly rewarded with lap dances from JF's groupies. Ew.  Lavo played songs from the late 80's to early 90's- a la junior high school gymnasium dances- with a sprinkling of Rhianna's newest album (I can't stand her nasal voice). Sometime around midnight, when the dance floor and bar areas were \"fire hazard\" packed, Lavo kissed the asses of their celebs by playing Busta's hits and JF's Golddigger hit. Very VEGAS.  The bartender guys n' gals were cute, prompt, and not stingy with their alcohol (even during open bar). Very ho-hum restrooms for a \"bathhouse\" nakesake.  I really don't see this place lasting for more than a year amongst clubs like Tao, Tryst, and Pure.",

    "text": "I'm gonna go with 3.5 stars and round down, because of the club. Here's a review for both the club and the restaurant:  RESTAURANT: Well, the night started off poorly. We had reservations (5 person group) for 10:15. After arriving at 10:00PM, we checked in and were told to expect a 10-15 minute wait. No big deal, we were early. But after 35 minutes, especially since we thought it'd be quick and didn't bother to hit the bar, it began to become a problem. We let the hostess know, and she told us that it would be a few minutes.  Here's where I pause to say that if you DON'T know, or you DO know that it'll be longer - just be upfront, or have someone else talk to us. I know it's a late night on one of their bigger club nights (Sunday), but let's be reasonable. After another 15 minutes (we've now been waiting for 50 minutes after being told 15), my wife spoke to a manager.  The manager was VERY helpful and accommodating. We were told our first round of drinks would be comped, and she sat us right away. Okay, definite plus marks there. Great customer service goes a long way.  On to the service and the food: The service is GREAT. Our waiter, Casey - was extremely knowledgeable, funny, and attentive. He didn't have to be told by us about the comped drinks, and gave great recommendations on the menu. Although, BE WARNED - the food is served a la carte, and as such, they are relentless upsellers (as to be expected, really). The sides and appetizers are fantastic though, and are quite big portions for both the apps and entrees.  I got the Chicken Parm, which was pretty good but nothing fantastic. It is HUGE (I finished about half). However, my side - the asparagus with lemon and pepper was GREAT. My wife got the spaghetti with Kobe meatballs which was EXCELLENT (and is in need of no side dish whatsoever). Our table also got an appetizer - the fried zucchini - which was also very, VERY good.   Again, great service - and their specialty drink, the Saggio (blueberry vodka, sage, lemon juice), is HIGHLY recommended. Their garlic bread with marinara that they bring out is also just fantastic. Bill was around $300 for the 5 of us with a couple drinks a piece (granted, one comped round).   And now, the club:  UGH.  Well...I should preface this by saying if I hadn't had so much fun at Vegas clubs in the past, and this was my first experience, I would have hated it. Not because the music was bad...in fact, it was GREAT (the DJ downstairs in the restaurant was also excellent). The sound system? Fantastic. I am a DJ and a bit of a music snob, so I am a bit hard to impress when it comes to this stuff. But on that level, they nailed it.  Unfortunately though, it was packed like sardines. Not like a typical packed Vegas club - I mean it was packed wall to wall with VERY little room to move. There were very few security guys keeping walkways open, and it had to have been over capacity. There is a difference between a full club, and an uncomfortably packed club. They were NOT holding the line, and every single inch of the club was just hot, packed, and uncomfortable. Not the greatest environment.  However, the decor is great, the music is great...it would have been much better to see some organization and management of the crowd and line.   Overall, I would return to the restaurant, but I doubt I'd be back to the club.",

Ok, so we got in, but we didn't go in. Long story.   Anyways, after Tao didn't exactly pan out.....one of the girls mentioned LAVO. We walked over to the other side of the Venetian to where LAVO was located. I was pleasantly surprised when I didn't see a line outside. (Why does that make me happy? I must be getting old.) We walked upstairs through a corridor of old Italian designed sinks to the dance area, where the club was located.   At 1am - the club area was so crowded. There was no place for nine girls trying to celebrate a bachelorette party to dance around and make the bride to be do some tricks! The music and mix was great, but we opted the chill in the bar area down stairs. We chilled in the bar area, which had an equally good mix of music, wasn't too crowded. The decor was pretty nice. The crowd was also a little older than the groups hanging out upstairs. (God, I'm old....why does that make me feel better.) Plus the staff did let us chill in the reserved areas of the bar area. There was no one there and we were ordering drinks, so win, win!   If I was just judging the club - I would only give it 2.0 stars. If I was only judging the Bar, I'd give it 4.0 stars. Let's do an average of 3.0.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here when we just missed getting into Maggiano's before closing.  I wish we'd gone for fast food instead.  First of all, LAVO restaurant is kept very dark, which I guess is for their 'nightclub' area.  I like to be able to see my food, but considering the quality of the food you get for the prices you pay here, I can understand why they keep it so dark.  Second, when the waiter came he offered us either tap water or bottled water.  I asked for the bottled water.  After he brought it out and poured our water into glasses, (enough for 3 medium glasses at most), I asked how much the bottle of water was.  $7 he said.  It would've been nice if, when I asked for bottled water, the waiter would've indicated there was something special about it or was up-front that it was $7 per bottle.  We asked for tap water after that.  I ordered the kobe (wanyu) beef meatballs, and they were way over spiced and salty.  The dish came with no sides... just meatballs, spaghetti, and sauce.  I actually wish it had more spaghetti to try to diffuse the over-spiced meatballs.  And though admittedly tender, I'm not sure what the point is of using a tender beef that gets blended up and mixed with breadcrumbs to make a meatball anyway?  As it was, I was only able to choke down half of the 3 overpriced kobe-wanyu meatballs, and I definitely didn't get the rest to go.  My friend ordered chicken parmigiana and that's all that was on the plate.  Just a big slab of flattened breaded chicken with cheese on top.  He wasn't impressed either.  He got a glass of red wine too that was only fair.  $13 for the glass, and it was probably from a $5/bottle wine.  All told, we wasted $100+ at LAVO, and would've been happier eating anywhere else, or not eating at all.  And having traveled for work many times, we've eaten at and appreciated fine eateries elsewhere in Vegas, SF, DC, and Texas... so we know what quality food is, and have been more than willing to pay for it.  But you won't find that at LAVO.  Don't get suckered by the pretty decor... LAVO is a shockingly bad and overpriced restaurant.",

Perfect for a date in the evening.   I've been here twice for the nightclub.

The first time I came the DJ was blowing my mind, the second time around I can't even remember what he played. To be honest, I was bored and was wondering where the real party was at. I was also thinking where the hell did all these old people come from. Shame on you! And don't you dare spill your drink on me you drunk ass bitch!

I had originally made reservations for four but our flights was delayed and then we were late getting ready so I had to call twice to change our reservation times and I had no problems doing so they were really understanding. When we arrive we were seating promptly...love the decor and bathrooms..the food was delicious and our waiter was awesome  This is a must when visiting Vegas. Our $240 tab for four including two bottles of wine was worth every penny",

    "text": "This review is solely based on my experience with the restaurant.   I had the meatball with ricotta cheese and it was absolutely heaven and I had some calamari which was super delicious.   For dinner, I had the filet with the chimichurri sauce and spinach which went above and beyond my expectations. Also, the salmon is spectacular and the fried oreos are a must. I was extremely pleased with this meal and pleasantly surprised to see how well priced things were-- especially compared to other restaurants in Vegas that don't come close favor-wise.   I'm giving it 5 stars because the food was delicious and our waiter was so nice and patient with our rather large party. I will definitely be coming back here any time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "We went here for our bachelor + bachelorette dinner while we were in Las Vegas.  We had a group of 35 people and did the pre-fixe menu since we had a larger group and were trying to make it in time for a show at like 9pm (and we made reservations ahead of time).  The inside of the restaurant and club is very nice and was a nice setting for our dinner.  Our dinner was awesome-- we loved it!  Even with 35 people, all of our food was served together at the same time and no one was left waiting for their food while everyone else was eating.  There were three or four options for each of the three courses and everyone seemed pleased with their food.  We also had someone in our party with special allergies and dietary needs and they were more than happy to accommodate them.  The portions for the pre-fixe menu was the perfect size and we didn't feel like we didn't get enough food.  The vote from the group was that the bread pudding for dessert was the best.    After the meal, the manager or someone from the restaurant came and spoke with our group and then offered all of us admission for later that night for no cover for the nightclub.  A smaller group of us went back to LAVO around midnight and they let us in right away without any charges.  The club is smaller than most of the clubs (ie Tao or Pure) but was still a great place for dancing and drinks.  We all enjoyed our experience with LAVO.  It was great for a large group (with reservations) and the food was so good!",

    "text": "Las Vegas...I ask you:  What is the deal with reservations?  Is it customary to make one, and still have to wait?  Are we reserving a time to come to the restaurant to wait?  Seems kind of redundant.  But hey, if that's your policy, fine, just want to make sure we're on the same page.    Although Lavo complies to the Vegas idea that reservations are not for tables but actually just make sure you have space to wait around near the bar, the drinks at said bar were pretty awesome.  And when we did get our table, we split one of their meatballs and that, too, was freakin fantastic.  Not everyone at the table was in love with their food but I had a caprese salad which was enormous, for one thing, and also very tasty.    Do yourself a favor and get the garlic fries with that mayo sauce on the side.  And the meatball.  Then go dance it off if you can still move.",

    "text": "My Wife made reservations for us at Palazzo for my Birthday. We had read that Lavo was great for the Sunday Brunch so we decided to start the day with the Brunch. Lavo opened at 10:00AM and we arrived a few minutes before opening. When we arrived there were already people in the waiting area therefore we figured that it would be best to check in with the hostess in case they get busy.  Upon greeting the hostess we were given a strange look like what are you doing here and then she said can I help you. We told her we were there for the Brunch at which time she said they were not open and we could wait. Remember, we were three minutes early. We walked around until we noticed a couch near the dining area and we decided to wait here. After 20 minutes of waiting and watching an unorganized staff the hostess came to us and asked if we were waiting for a table. We told her once again that we were waiting for a table and she then proceeded to a table in the dining room for us to have a seat. We asked if the terrace was available as we had read that the terrace was nice. She did not know and had to ask a server who told her yes. The hostess then directed us to the terrace where we were seated and provided menus.  After another 15 minutes of not being helped or even acknowledged we got up and walked out. As we left all of the wait staff was in the area and not one of the staff asked us if we needed anything. as we walked past the hostess station there was another employee there that appeared to have some level of authority as they were in business attire. As we were leaving I said to her that we were leaving after 30 minutes of waiting and there was not response. We left and went to Mario Batli's Enoteco Otto where we had a wonderful experience.",

Located in the Palazzo Hotel this nightclub is the best place to pre-game for drinks or a place to unwind from a wild night.   Bouncers and promoters are alway chill and quick to lend a hand to groups of girls. Luckily, we had help from a few promoters to get our night cracking! Leading up to Lavo you walk a small balcony over looking the dining area. Its cool how they have open sinks on the balcony leading to Lavo. The nightclub itself is small. Nothing to grand about that the place. Its plain with nice interior design.   If you catch yourself going early sometimes they have free drinks for ladies. An even added plus is when the promoters have free drink tickets and then forsure the drinks will be coming your way.  The bouncers themselves are very nice. They even help you up on the ''stage'' to dance. the dancefloor is small.. real small but I have found that it doesn't get to crowded like other nightclubs.   What I most like about Lavo is that it is not to crowded. Its not overwhelming like other larger venues and it is nice that you can just chill and hangout.",

    "text": "MEATBALLS!! That's all you gotta know about Lavo (the restaurant)   Staying at the Palazzo means having an array or restaurants to choose from. My friend and I wanted something convenient, Italian, with outdoor seating availability. We chose Lavo.   We actually took quite a bit of time looking over the menu; having trouble deciding on a pasta dish, meatballs, or a signature dish.  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our appetites. After having decided on an order of Kobe Meatballs with Ricotta, Salmon Oreganto, and the Chicken and Mushroom Ravioli, we quickly had a change of heart.  The waiter gave us fair warning that the first two dishes would be sufficient, and boy was he right.  We cancelled the ravioli and ordered:   Kobe Meatballs with Ricotta ($22): holy meatball.. this thing was ginormous! The waiter wasn't kidding around, this could easily serve 3-4 people; especially after serving us the complimentary garlic bread. The meatball was juicy and tender, although a bit salty for my taste (I am very senstiive to salty foods) but to anybody else I'm sure it's just the right amount of salty.  Perfect when paired with the garlic bread.  Definitely something I would come back for in the future. Hell, I'd even come, sit at the bar and order just the meatball.  Salmon Oreganato ($29): this too was a bit on the saltier side. We honestly probably could have done without this had we known the garlic bread would be so filling.  The fish was pretty good, not too dry and very flavorful.  The cucumber nestled underneath the salmon helped balance the saltiness of the fish and was very refreshing.    20 Layer Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake ($13):  This was quite a hefty-sized cake.  Pretty good bang for your buck if you're sharing among 4+ people.  Between the two of us, we barely made a dent.  It tasted like a peanut butter cup... and I LOVE peanut  butter cups.  I will say, I am not a fan of the chocolate shavings they put on the outside of the cake.. too crunchy and adds to the already over-sweet taste of the dessert.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what the highlight of our evening at Lavo was.  It was, to put it simply, stellar.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly and the service, in general, was excellent.  Shortly after arriving, we were brought some of that legendary garlic bread wrapped in foil with a ramekin of marinara sauce.  It lived up to its reputation.  The drinks were quite good, although my Lavotini(?) was a bit too passionfruit-y for me.   My husband's* Amaro Is Another Day was divine.  The DJ who spun that night was quite talented and my brain exploded into candy when he played Modjo \"Lady,\" my jam during a Caribbean cruise my junior year of high school.    Dinner arrived quickly.  I ordered the chicken and mushroom ravioli which were flavorful and had a satisfying texture, topped with greens.  Mike's crispy chicken and potatoes with a balsamic glaze was equally delicious, however our entrees were subsequently outshined by dessert.    La piece de resistance: OREO ZEPPOLE!  These were even better than the street fair favorite deep-fried Oreos, especially when dunked into the glass of vanilla malt they came with. We were given five of them on a plate upon which that the chef had etched \"Congratulations\" with chocolate syrup plus the malt had a candle in it.    I had my doubts about checking out Lavo after reading some of the questionable reviews of the NYC location, however, after eating at the fabulous sister restaurant Avra a few weeks ago and hearing how good the food would be, I decided it deserved a visit.  When I asked Mike last night what he wanted for dinner tonight, he said, \"Can we go back to Lavo?\"  At least his second choice was my homemade quiche, and I would welcome any opportunity to return to this sexy resto-lounge that is sexy in both atmosphere and vibe.  For one thing, the ricotta and Kobe meatball may require our investigation.  *That was my first time referring to him as such in a Yelp review.  : D",

We had reservations for 22 people. They seated us at 2 tables next to each other.  Then about 30 minutes later the guests at one of our tables were told that we had to move.  The owner of the club had friends that were coming in and they gave our table to them.  So half of us were left standing.  We were never given mimosas or a food menu.  After an hour or so they threw some plates of food on the table, but no plates or silverware.  My daughter was in tears the whole time because this was not the experience that she paid $2200 for.  It was not even close to what they advertised.  And they didn't care one bit that they ruined our day.  I will NEVER set foot in that place again and if you're smart you won't either.",

    "text": "This was our first stop for a bachelorette weekend in Vegas. Be careful with the bottomless breakfast mimosas! They are $30 and the price per drink lowers more quickly than you'd expect...Tip:  if you go, request Elton as your server! He's fantastic. (Elton even gave us to-go cups for our mimosas as we were leaving!)  Food prices are reasonable for Vegas. I had the spinach, tomato and goat cheese omelet. It was excellent!  We arrived mid-morning but were told party brunch didn't start until 2 p.m. Despite being misled on the phone while making the reservation, we went ahead and ate. At first, we were seated outside to enjoy the sunshine. The balcony was just a little too windy so we came back inside. This is when we had to switch from Elton to Matt as our server.   Elton was a great and friendly server. Matt, not so much. The restaurant was almost completely empty when we ate (around 11 a.m., which is very early by Vegas standards). So empty half of it was curtained off. My friend sat her purse down on an empty chair next to our table. When she got up to use the restroom, Matt came over and switched the chairs. He told us it was rude to put her purse on a chair and \"against policy.\" What first seemed like he was joking ended up coming across as very rude, especially when she returned and Matt decided it would be appropriate for him to lecture her about \"common courtesy.\" We immediately requested Elton as our server again! Fortunately for us, the balcony was still empty (because it was so early), so we were able to switch servers.  After the encounter with Matt, the manager Alissa began checking on us periodically. We told her what happened with Matt. While I do want to speak very highly of her, she did come across as refusing to pick sides. She was very defensive of Matt, claiming he was joking and it's because we just don't know him, but also acknowledged that this is the hospitality industry and his attitude was unacceptable. Alissa is a peacemaker, and we appreciated her concern though wish she would have held a firmer ground against rude service.  As we left, we did get stamps so that we could come back later for party brunch if we wanted. Since the pools had just opened the weekend before, Alissa told us we would also have access to Tao Beach at the Venetian. We mentioned Alissa's name to the bouncer and that got us in.   Overall, it was a good spot for brunch and a great start to the weekend--dampened just a little by Matt's rude service.",

The first courses arrived where the server never checked to make sure everything was correct. The spicy lobster bisque was bland. When the main courses arrived one of our meals was forgotten. Rather than owning up to the servers mistake on the matter, he got argumentative on not one occasion on inquiry but two. If you're attempting to provide a \"semi-fine\" dining experience, then perhaps manners need to be taught. I would have had a better experience in the food court.",

We shared the beet salad which was one of the best we've had and we shared the chicken parmesan which was the perfect combination of crispy and cheesy goodness. We finished the meal with the 20 layer peanut butter and chocolate cake - sinfully excellent. We took it back to the room and enjoyed the rest of it the next day.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I never actually tried the food.  I was interested in the Night Club portion of this establishment.  There are several people on the outside trying to ensure that everyone stays in line.  Depending on who is checking names and stamping wrist, this can be a time consuming process.  I did not have too long of a wait either time I went.    Tuesday night, down stairs, in the lounge area, they were playing a nice hip hop/r&b mixture, and you had sever inebriate people making attempts to look cool dancing, which is always a plus for me!  The design is puzzling because the decorum is nice for the lounge area, but they forgot to include a dance area, so people usually dance in the walk way leading to the outside seating area and/or around the bar.    Upstairs was techno night.  LOTS of energy in the place.  I really enjoyed the energy, even though Techno music is quite repetitive in sound.    One of the club promoters saw me before I left and told me they wanted me to come back Wednesday and that they were putting me on the guest list.  Wednesday, I am back to see if it was worth my time.  Turns out it was the 1 year anniversary of hip hop Wednesday.  Downstairs had nice music and a nice crowd.  Upstairs was crazy packed with all kinds of people and the energy in the room was bananas.  I was enjoying the nice mixture of every coast of music and in walks Reverend Run of Run DMC fame and takes the energy and fun to an entire different level/hemisphere/planet!    Needless to say, I enjoyed myself here.  I don't know what the food taste like or I may have just given this place 5 stars.",

We were starving so jumped right into to the complimentary garlic bread with Marinara dipping sauce.    Like I said, we were starving and our service was relatively slow so I was getting antsy, but one my seared tuna with sundried tomatoes and artichokes came out I was happy. Food stellar. I'm a pescaterian at the moment so I had to pass on the signature meatballs unfortunately.   Warning-still water comes at a hefty price, we were blinded by the price and needed up getting charged $56 for water. $56 for water is ridiculous. Would have like some warning on that one but you live and learn.  The restaurant was beautiful and the Italian infused dishes are so tastes but this only gets 4 stars for some spotty service.",

    "text": "My experience at Lavo couldn't have been any worse unless I'd gotten food poisoning...luckily, the food was so inedible that that wasn't a problem. My list of grievances:  - They \"lost\" my party of 6's reservation. Upon finding it again, we still waited AN HOUR before being seated, and were told twice during that time period how they were \"just getting the table ready now\"...yet when we finally arrived at said table it didn't have any plates. Or forks. Or glasses. Or enough chairs.   - We were asked if we wanted sparkling or still water. Half the table went still while the other half went sparkling. We were never told if there was a charge or how much it might be. Being a classy gentleman, I assumed that the sparkling would cost something, but imagine my surprise to see a combined charge of $32 for water at the end of the night. $32 for tap water and some sparkling that was likely made with the same tap water and an in-house carbonator.  - Being an Italian place, I went with my go to dish, the Linguine Pescatore. Absolutely inedible. Beyond merely \"salty\" and somewhere beyond the tipping point where the dish is actually more salt than pasta. I coerced two people at the table to try it to confirm that I wasn't just tasting it weirdly and they confirmed that it was horrible. For some context, I have NEVER sent a single dish back in my life until this one. So thank you Lavo, for helping me with my bucket list. When asked if I wanted something else, how could I possibly say yes? I instead grazed on my girlfriend's pretty mediocre bolognese pasta and my friend's also incredibly salty but at least edible chicken parmesan. All in all, the entrees were terrible to mediocre from what I was able to try.  - The bill. With a 20% tip (more on that later), the bill came out to around $450. That seems reasonable at first, except I didn't actually have an entree, and a husband and wife pair in the group split one. So doing some math, that's around $112 per person for food that was incredibly sub-standard. I do not mind paying for quality. I DO mind being ripped off.  So what were the redeeming things about Lavo, if any? Only two that I can think of:  - The meatball appetizer that we got free as part of an apology for leaving us waiting for an hour after our reservation was great.   - Our server was very attentive, very accommodating, and gave us impeccable service. His 20% tip is the only part of the bill I don't regret.",

There were a lot of girls in groups who were looking for guys to dance with and there are several places people can stand on to get a better view.   We had a drink in the bar before the club opened and I liked the vibe. The bartenders were smoking and the clientele were chill. Inside the club they also have shot waitresses coming around and you can see by the girl in the left's pic she got pretty $hitfaced.

We were on a guest list.  It may not have mattered except we paid no cover, and our wristband granted us free drinks for an hour. Just make sure to tip the bartenders!  We crawled up a TON of stairs...we overlooked the restaurant at one point.  WHY does Vegas insist in putting in a f*ckton of stairs that girls in 7\" heels have to climb up, and then stumble/fall down later?! This makes no sense to me.  Annnnyways...the club upstairs was smallish, compared to some of the mega clubs in LV.  They were playing great music though, the bartenders were friendly and attentive, and the ladies bathroom attendant was a blast!  I def had a good time here.  Not super packed like some of the new clubs, which can be a plus or negative, depending on what kind of night you are looking for,  I wouldn't NOT come back if someone insisted, but it would not be my top go-to club either.  The restaurant scene looked nice and trendy with lots of youngish people (as young as can afford a nice dinner) and I could see a lovely night with dinner and clubbing all in one location here.  Bonus: free drinks for an hr. (but that was specific to my guest list) Bogus: so many freaking stairs in heels!!",

I felt that the tables were too close to each other on the patio.  I don't want to go in details about my dinner as it was so ordinary that I frankly do not care to remember what I had. It just wasn't memorable.  What was memorable was that while we sat at our table on the patio, we noticed that Chewy from the Chelsea Lately show was next to us at a different but larger table.  He was surrounded by a couple of very young and pretty girls however the whole thing did not match. It was loud out on the patio and the last thing I wanted to do was to stretch myself and listen to Chewy (the little nugget) having a conversation with his entourage.",

We got complimentary baked goods (croissant, churro, etc.) at the start of the meal which were warm and fresh. The meatball is amazing as is the breakfast mac and cheese. Tyler also came by to check on us/ fill our waters and he was equally friendly and professional. The atmosphere is relaxing and upscale (theme is bath house). We definitely would come back and recommend this place to our friends. Thanks guys!",

After this, server was not as helpful as previous trip.  For food, ordered baked clams as appetizer; it was over baked and salty and difficult to eat.  For main dish ordered Penne Seafood Alfredo; this again was too salty.  Lastly, ordered Rolled Chocolate 7 layer cake; this was good.  Manager comped me for appetizer because of the delay.  Overall, atmosphere is great; but, food and service appear to be hit and miss!",

Also tried to club which I remember was decent and not that crowded.   Recently, on our girls trip to vegas we stopped here for a drink on thursday night. I had the Saggio which was delicious!!! but expected a little more when it cost me $14. Friend got the pomegranate lemonade which was yummy and the other got a peach vodka tonic by recommendation of the waiter. It was so dead it was pretty sad, and there was a lone DJ spinning for himself. The decor is gorgeous and the bartender was nice enough, but they closed around like midnight on Thursday night so we were only there for 30 minutes.   It's fine, but a little disappointing for the dead-ness.",

It took 55 min to get to our table before it was followed by our cold dinner   Atmosphere( 4 star) solid setting, decor and lighting. Lovely   Summary: I'd go back for drinks and the meatball.

    "text": "***Club Review***  My friends and I got in without having to pay the $20+ cover because we were in town for NAB and our passes got us in for free. That was the one of the few good things of our experience here. The DJ and the music was also pretty good. No complaints there. I'm not even complaining about the $8 I spent on a Newcastle.  I am however complaining about the staff with attitudes that work here. I'm also raising an eyebrow at the staff about our missing items. Here's what went down:  Sunday 4/15 On the dancefloor, a random patron taps my friend on the shoulder to ask him if he lost a cell phone. My friend looks at the phone, says it's not his, then witnesses the patron turn the phone in to the DJ. Several moments later, my other friend realizes that his cell phone is missing only to find out that this was the same phone that was found earlier. Both friends go to club security with the info that the phone was given to the DJ only to find out that club security took it to hotel security. Hotel security has no record of it.  Tuesday 4/17 While in line to get in, one of our friends steps away to find hotel security to hopefully get more info on his missing cell phone. When he returns, the club bouncer immediately extracts him from the line. I understand that he was only doing his job and not letting people cut. But rather than telling him to get to the back of the line, he flat out tells him to leave. He wasn't gonna let him into the club! I mean, our friend wasn't even intentionally cheating his way in. I'm sure that the 2 people in line behind us didn't mind that we saved our friend's spot in line but even if they did, we wouldn't try to disrespect them. The bouncer just wanted to throw his power trip around on a tuesday night. After some major ass kissing on my friend's part, the bouncer finally let him go to the back of the line.  On the dancefloor, another friend realizes that her clutch purse is no longer on her wrist. In a panic, our whole group is searching the entire club for the purse. Club security notifies us that it was found but when they hand it over, her iPhone is missing. One of the guys in our group continued to question club security about the missing iPhone who claims that they haven't found one. But in desperation, our friend says to security \"I'll pay you $20 for the iPhone\" and security's response was \"Wait, what color did you say it was?\" WTF??? Why did security suddenly change their story the moment my friend offered a bribe?  I do however have to say that the random patrons that we met at this place has been extremely cool and genuinely concerned with all the bad stuff that kept happening to us throughout the night. We even got invited to hang out in the VIP area for table service by a few different groups. Again, I understand that staff is doing their best to make sure that the tables stay reserved for those who reserve it. So when one of the waitresses told us that we had to leave, I tried to politely explain to her that the people who reserved the table invited us to drink with them. She responded with the biggest attitude: \"Don't yell at me!\" Um...hello? I wasn't yelling at you. I'm just talking loud because we're in a club and if I don't talk loud then you won't be able to hear me!  The staff here needs to get over themselves. SMH.",

We told our waitress this and she said no problem.  My wife ordered a soda from the waitress and it never came.  They put us at the end of the table, right where the walkway for the waitstaff was.  Two out of three of them bumped into my chair each and every time they went past.  I scooted in as far as I could go.  The menu is a la carte, so get ready for Vegas food price gouging!    At 8:32pm, our food still had not shown, so we left.  Went to the show and had pretzels and beer.  When we left we went back to the Ventian, but not to LAVO.  Not EVER!  Had a good late night meal at Grand LUX Cafe.  Good food there! Please see their review that I did.",

Each table can really only sit 4 people so if u want more people to sit at once you should get separate bottle service packages but not needed if some people are dancing while others sit.

    "text": "While on our wild vacation out to Las Vegas, my wife and I wanted to try the restaurants in Vegas, aside from the well established feeding grounds of buffets and $5 steaks.  We decided to go to LAVO    While everyone waits for Tao, you can save some headaches and sore legs by going to this sister restaurant.  When we went to LAVO however, with a reservation mind you, we still wound up having to wait for half an hour for our table.  However, it wasn't all that bad.  The bar and lounge area are very comfortable and inviting, so we ordered a few drinks and sat around talking and watching the game on the television.    After we were seated, I finally noticed how small the dining area actually was, which could have been the reason for delayed seating.  Seating was probably limited to approximately 20 - 25 parties inside and some seating outside.  Outside seating would be nice, aside from the still blistering heat and trove of cars rolling up and down The Strip.  You could also enjoy the show at Treasure Island across the street.  Still, we decided to stay indoor and enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant itself.  The waitress, who looked like Leslie Bibb, immediately came over and went over the menu with us.  She was really nice and assisted us with a wine recommendation with our meal.  The wine turned out to be quite good and matched the equally delicious kobe beef meatball, A MUST HAVE.  Actually, we ordered two, even though one was more than enough.  The tartare was quite delicious as well.    The piece de resistance was the Chilean sea bass.  Cooked just right and tender, the bass was just pure heaven.  Never had I had fish that was on any level comparable to the fish I had here.  I would come here every time when I'm in Vegas just for it.  Didn't go to the nightclub though, since we head so many negatives about it.  Still the restaurant was well worth it and hopefully won't be affected by the reviews of the nightclub.",

Did I say, \" FREE?\" Yes, I said, \" FREE!!!!!!!\" Now listen up y'all, I was there in the beginning of January of this year, so I don't know if that is still applicable, but keep your eyes peeled for it. Can't beat that for Vegas, as drinks there seems to cost an arm and a leg, unless you have connections. It helps if you know someone that lives there, ( kind of like the kama'aina discount,) then maybe you can get on a few guest lists for clubs or whatever. Anyways, it's right across the way from TI. We sat outside on the balcony with a nice heat lamp to accompany us, and  got to see the free show with front row seats, and we each had a nice flight of about four wine glasses to ourselves generously  poured!!!   Gratis in Vegas is alllll good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okole maluna!",

It was just a bunch of the same stuff I've been hearing on the radio for the past year, but what do you expect? If they at least threw in an old (or even new) hip hop song with a bangin' beat, I'd be a little more happy, but they didn't. I almost slipped on some drink spills a few times because no one came over to clean it up, but I guess that's hard to notice. The bathrooms were very dark and kind of small. The one thing I thought was pretty cool when I went was that they were giving out free Styrofoam glowstick things and glow necklaces. It was pretty cool until some ghetto guy came up to me and jacked one from my hands. I actually took a picture inside the club and didn't realize how many creepy crunk people were there until I looked at the picture afterward (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F_7NLWpbuT1muUTdVQvKzfA%2Fl.jpg&s=1ab6b677b25b902f5679ee3ecce1a048bd3b942f60803c6229838d020e2de723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>).

They had open bar from 11-12 when I went. There isn't much space to move around, and people are constantly spilling drinks everywhere. Getting from one point to the other is insanely difficult due to the small space. The tables are close together and barely even visible in the crowds. The crowd is mediocre, although the guys I met were more than willing to buy girls' drinks. I went on a Tuesday night and found it way too crowded for comfort. Find a promoter to get you in for free--I wouldn't pay to get in here.",

Back in 2009, I saw several celebrities also partying here to note Paris Hilton among others, though it was not overly crowded and the music was enough to keep you having a good time. The venue is always beautiful, especially with the live models as decoration. This past December 2012, I also had the same fun and experienced great livelihood without being stampeded in crowds. Drinks and entrance was free and we even got glow in the dark gear that everyone else wanted for the rest of the night.",

He was starting to get so annoying and rude to the bartender and demanded attention, showing off his many black creditcards and namedropping his own name (!) all over the place.  I was more into someone else and not him which pee'd him off more and I went and hid. Long story short: the bathrooms are FANTASTICLE! really ellegant and once you figure out how to turn on the water in the sinks you are good to go!  The lighting in there makes even the biggest cellulite bump dissapear.  The music is really good and the food is better.  The bartenders are really nice people, so be nice to them people!!   The lines are long at the club so go eat first then go upstairs. Its worth it and good pick up place if you are into little asian chickeroos.",

But NO...we did not get that. A friend and I ordered the $70/ea Tomahawk steak to be cooked medium and 2 other friends ordered the $60 ribeye medium rare. The dinners came and the meats were cooked INCORRECTLY for all of us. We ended up switching//trading steak pieces all night. DISSAPPOINTING to say the least. Paid good money for a messed up order! I explained this to the waiter and he said \"So your ok?\"... Meaning we messed up the order but since you switched your steaks around... Your all good!?!? NO YOU IDIOT! We're not ok!!! I expect my food to come out right not having to cut into the steaks to see if its worth eating and hand it off to my friends. If they want repeat customers, this is not how to conduct business. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone. The bathroom is outdated, they use a pump of softsoap and they have black toilets which looks dirty. Bartender could not speak to the speciality cocktails and we could not understand a word he was saying. THIS PLACE SUCKS COW BALLS!",

Got in free on Friday night, and everybody is incredibly nice, from the bouncers (thank you, bouncer inside, who held me up as me and my drunken friend switched our shoes) to the bartenders. The music was GOOD, and I never stopped dancing for a second. This particular night LMFAO was performing (or so I was told the next morning...my memory fails me as the entire night was a blur).   My only gripes about this place was that it was incredibly crowded and thus it was hard to sift through the crowd.",

It is run by the same people who runs TAO but I feel like the crowd is significantly different. The good thing about LAVO is  that you have the same nice decor inside with great music minus the TAO crowd! It is definitely refreshing to go in a club in Vegas and have room to dance and move! The last time we went, we seriously got hooked-- our own table and a comp bottle of vodka. What more can we ask for?",

We got there around 15 mins early and they asked us if we want the outside table.  I said yes and they told us to wait for 5-10 mins.    After waiting for 15 mins, I came to ask about our table and the lady told me that they made a mistake and gave our table away.  Common, how can they make this kind of stupid mistake.  So, we patiently waited for another 45 mins until we got our table.  This is ridiculous that we have to wait for an hour with reservation!!!   On top of this, there were 4 different waiters and waitresses serving our table.  They're running around like a lost dogs.  I asked one waiter for something and never saw him again.  So I had to ask another person when they come by our area.  I don't think they deserve the high-end restaurant mark in their services.",

The conversations are pretty loud, so it's hard to have a discussion over dinner as the tables are rather close to each other.  Our group ordered the following dishes:  1) Spaghetti and Meatballs 2) Linguini Seafood Alfredo 3) Bone-In Filet with Truffles and Carrots on top   The meals were done pretty well as the pasta tasted really good (not over-cooked) and the sauces were tasteful and flavorful.  The steak was cooked well and I had a great meal.  The pricing was pretty decent for the quality of the food, so, we didn't feel that we were spending way too much for a nice dinner.  Maybe next time, we'll come back for another dinner and also for the nightclub upstairs.  Recommend.",

Meatball, tender , pretty good, Lobster Ravioli, very good. (Another pasta  dish) forgettable! Pasta was was undercooked, when we mention it - was told oh it's typical for it's a thick pasta; really? I disagree. They did offer to make another and or replace. We ordered 2 side veggies, Asparagus and Rosemary potatoes =  Nothing great about these, just what it is, but WAY small portions and WAY over priced! Had some great cocktails.  Dessert =  20 layer cake , really good, rich  but good worth it. Fried Oreo Z's. AMAZING! A must try.  I think over all I'd give these guys a  another try, just different items next time.  NOTE: If your going to charge that much,  make it worth it including the ambiance. Just was off with that crazy music you played. Beautiful decor, just whole place didn't blend, off?",

The meatballs are very good - definitely worth trying and I would say splitting one with someone else is a good appetizer since they are huge! Ordered an amaretto sour to drink (very good) and had the cheese ravioli for my main course. The ravioli was good but the portion was very small for the price point. Service was fantastic both in the restaurant and at the bar. If you can and if the weather is nice try to get a table outside it is really beautiful overlooking the strip. Overall if you are in town check out Lavo. I'm a local and i'll be back because of their outstanding service and delicious Italian food.",

And the tables are TINY, so... it got pretty crowded. Anyways, open bar till 12:30AM, then bottle service with the promoters so it all worked out.  There was a convention of some sort so the beginning of the night saw a crowd of older folks, so the DJ catered the music towards them. Once they cleared out, he started spinning more hip hop, which was great cuz hip hop is hard to find in Vegas.  The security guard assigned to our table was awesome, really funny and he even escorted my friend to the restroom cuz she didn't know where it was.  Watch out for those tricky tables! The glass is sloped at the end so if you place your drink too close to the edge, your drink will end up all over your shoes.  The club is quite small (it's the same size as a club in Vancouver! Lame) so it gets pretty packed on the dance floor.  A night of highs (free drinks, great music & people) & lows (too many free drinks, people getting kicked out [not me!]), but a great time overall.",

Not a bad deal.   Unfortunately, drinks were watered down, even the ones we paid for after midnight. so the BF and I were barely tipsy after about 7 drinks in.  The played more hip hop than anything else, which was just ok for me. I don't listen to house music on the regular but I like variety! They also played a lot of old music which wasn't what I expected.   What I really didn't like was how small this place was! It was packed and the layout wasn't the best. Staff was ok. Bartenders were pretty good at staying on top of things. The mix of people here wasn't too bad. But for a place that keeps being advertised as associated with TAO I expected a little more.  I had fun more because of the people I was with than because of my experience with Lavo. I probably won't come back, except maybe to try the restaurant.",

    "text": "I honestly don't know a single thing about how the food was - I came here specifically for the club.  So this review will consider all things CLUB wise.  The only thing I really knew about Lavo is that it was the sister to Tao, the insanely popular restaurant/nightclub located in the Venetian.    First of all, the line-up they've been getting have been awesome as far as this House Music Fan is concerned.  My man BT, Gabriel and Dresden, just some powerhouses as far as trance goes.  I'm all over it!  I was a little wary, though, as I've gone to clubs to go see a particular DJ/artist and had to spend bank and wait forever and be subjected to someone's judgement if I was tall, rich, hot enough to be there and just waiting to see if the actual experience itself was good enough to justify the trial to get in.    WELL, how did LAVO measure up?  I came on a Tuesday night about 11:30pm.  I was dressed in all black with dress shoes, button down dress shirt, and dress pants.  My partner in crime came punk-ish and we had a concern that her in her boots and torn but fashionista style would be barred.  Thankfully, we were let in about a ten minute wait in line and after presenting IDs, were let in for free.  Woo!  I'll admit, it is a little off-putting to walk over the restaurant to get to the actual \"club,\" as you are looking down on the diners and such but it quickly gives way to the actual club space which makes you forget exactly where you are.  The Roman Bath theme is pretty nice - understated but elegant with abstract lighting.  The rows of fountains leading in are nice touch as well.    The actual dance/bar/lounge space is a little smaller than I'd like but we did find a corridor that allowed us to  talk and hang (right outside the girl's bathroom), so we were able to enjoy our drinks without feeling too impacted.  When we walked in I was NOT too happy as security was rushing past us with a group of people trying to find a place for them.  My partner in crime informed me that one of the people in the group was a Kardashian so that explained the unmitigated, UNNECESSARY hysteria that was that entourage.  Wanting nothing to do with that circus, I made a point of staying as far away as I could from that.   (Sorry, I don't watch television, don't care about celebrities, don't care that you're famous for basically contributing nothing to society in terms of science/art/charity/concepts.)  BT comes on and does an hour and a half set between two DJs.  I thought this set was a little short but WHO CARES, he's my favorite artist and he did a few of his own songs which was pretty cool.  YAY BT.  The swag was pretty cool and I got a kick out of the golden dancing Buddha.  I wonder if they got him on loan.    FRIENDLY bouncers/security.   BONUS POINTS for the security guy who saw someone trying to light their cigarette and offered them a light.  Gentleman you are, sir.  SHORT VERSION:  On a Tuesday: 10 minute wait to get in.  Slightly crowded.  Vodka/Cran = $9.  Friendly staff.  Would go back again.",

I was surprised that the dance floor was so large, compared to the rest of the club.  I spent most of the night on the dance floor due to the lack of seating in VIP.  Thankfully, the DJ was playing some very passable selections.  Nothing of note, but decent enough to keep the dance floor packed and my robot in motion.  There were tons of cougars on the prowl on Friday night.  Apparently, a cougar convention had just finished up earlier that day at the Hilton and they all migrated to Lavo for appetite satiation.    Was I someone's prey?  I was locked-in on, but I was elusive enough to escape their grasps.  I slid my way to a walkway that overlooked the dance floor and kept my eyes peeled for predators.  I don't think I'd visit Lavo again.  It's got nothing to do with the cougars and everything to do with the size.  It's just too small.  Besides, I still have a major crush on Tao.  What was that...",

First off, the place is stunning from top to bottom and the bathrooms are beautiful and well kept! Our servers name was Jessi and she could not have been more hospitable. She had great recommendations to make my birthday meal one to remember. She suggested the cucumber mojito which was just perfect for me. We enjoyed the spaghetti with carbonara and truffles as well as a nice steak. To end it all she suggested the fried Oreos! Thank you Jessi and the entire Lavo team for making my birthday something to remember, we WILL be back!",

    "text": "I think my rating might be a bit unfair. I was having a dinner meeting here so I was more engaged with the conversation vs. the food. However the things that I noticed were the following:  - The portions are too big. Some might enjoy it but you'll be so overwhelmed with the appetizers that perhaps you won't enjoy the main course as much.  - The ambiance is great. Well put together and the lighting is nice too. I would have thought the presentation of the food would have better suited the theme that they created   - Quality of the food is definitely 3stars. Again. Nothing that I wow'd over.   It reminds me of being at a really fancy restaurant while being served food from maggiano's (nothing wrong with maggiano's)...but it didn't live up to what I was expecting  The staff was very friendly and our server was beyond helpful. Supporting staff was always attentive as well. Perhaps I came in with a different impression and got something different?? I'm sure I will try it again, perhaps with a more casual group.",

    "text": "Not good for bigger parties. Went here for a friends birthday last night and I left very frustrated at the service. The food was good, we sat outside and it had a nice ambiance, the price was high, but you can expect that from a fine dining restaurant on the strip. What you shouldn't expect is having to do math at your table, outside in the cold for 45 minutes because your server won't split your check.. We had to literally sit and write each persons card number down, what they ate, how much each persons tax was and how much we needed to put on each card, with no help from our server. And to top it off when we brought it to him he said it wasn't the way he needed it and we had to start over. I don't go to a restaurant to practice my math skills, just split the tab. I work in a restaurant so I understand things aren't perfect but this was ridiculous. Our server didn't seem to take us very seriously because we were a younger group. Not ok. For big parties, prepare to close out and organize your check with no help.",

The wait staff was attentive, polished, knowledgeable, and importantly, flexible when we had to order off-menu a bit.  The food was enjoyed by everybody.  The chicken parm was a generous, tasty portion. The four cheese ravioli was hand made and big and delicious. The noodles in the pasta were fresh.  The only negative was the hostess was overwhelmed and young, but I kept on top of her and got our table within a few minutes of our 7:45pm reservation.  The check totalled about $120 for four.",

Isn't that the point of a reservation? So you Won't have to wait?? .smh. Anyway., the night was great, the food was good and we got to see Chris Rock and David Spade. We were maybe 3 tables away from their table. And there's a club upstairs., that we didn't check out since our night was booked. Maybe next time :)",

After a 30 min wait, we walked up expecting to pay $30 by club promoter hearsay. Ugly lady working the register, \"$40 cover\" after a little wtfusaytomeb*tch, I relented, along with a few of my buddies. A couple resorted to going back since clubbing isn't really their thing. Our girls got in free along with free drinks till 1AM.   Drinks were STRONG. The girls had no problem getting 3-4 drinks in an 1.5 hr span.  Club is TINY. and that's an understatement. We went to the dance floor and I thought we were at Walmart for black friday.   Giving this place 3 stars only cause TYGA put on a good performance, otherwise it would've been 2.   After TYGA's performance, we left to go play some craps and who shows up at our table? TYGA. After droppin' a few 'hunneds' we bounced and bid TYGA farewell.  Overall a DECENT night at LAVO. TYGA's performance and rollin' dice with him.",

    "text": "I visited on a Wednesday evening with one guest at 9:30pm. Here for Restaurant Week.  Verdict: Come here if you want a great Italian meal before you bring your expensive entourage of fine ladies to your table at Marquee. Don't come here if you want to bring kids or to escape the common heathen scene: It's too loud and people look like they're heading to a club.  Ambiance: 4/5 Yes, it is nice: Dark interiors with Mediterranean accents set the stage, with each choice lighting proving a visual delight. The house music pumping through the air reminds you that this is also a nightclub. The CONS: Can be too loud/raunchy to be considered intimate, dark enough to make your eyes strain, and tables are too close together. My guest's seat got run into by a rushing waiter.  Service: 4/5 Reservations process was smooth? Check. Greeted and seated with a smile? Check. Genuine and sincere service, even though things were busy? Check. Table checks throughout the dinner? Check. What they missed: In between our table checks our glasses were empty. We were 3/4ths of a way through our entrees, which proved to be heavy-handed on the salt so we needed water to continue. Our waiter was either on break or dealing with someone else, but no busser was available. Finally got filled 5min. later. Not end of the world, but not 5 stars.   Food: 4/5 Kobe carpaccio is all sorts of buttery and yummy: Full-bodied yet not salty. The Kobe rice balls, while balanced, is reminiscent of risotto. Our bread that came at the same time have herbs and butter baked on, with marinara for dipping. My penne alla vodka was perfectly al dente. Strong bacon flavor. However, salt levels became intolerable. A pity, because it is a well flavored dish but someone was heavy-handed with the salt. Dessert: Might be an Italian thing, but they were quite heavy. Tiramisu was too creamy for my preferences, and did not pair with either entree. The cheesecake was large, light, and sweet. Kinda like how I like that one guy out of Shaolin Soccer. BTW, Food was timely.   Value: 4/5 Portion sizes are filling. Not Mcmullan's-ginormous-Irish-nachos, but we brought back dessert. Plus, you definitely taste the quality of the ingredients. Now, I am comparing this place to Panevino, Trattoria Nakamura-ya (yes, I know traditional Italian does not have uni, but this is my review and uni pasta is my postmodern Italian), Cuigino's, and Olive Garden (lol, I had to): This ranks #3, with Trattoria easily leading and this following Panevino quite closely. No, Olive Garden did not rank. Thank you for participating in Restaurant Week!   Mood: I'm full. It's been a while since I party-rocked. Where's the water and the party?  Total rating: 3.5/5 base rating, +0.5 for good mood, 4/5",

I'm surprised they didn't bust out of my top the way the Hulk busts through his purple pants. Jeez...  Hmm.what else to tell you? I had a slip & fall incident because some jerk off spilled their drink on the already slippery floor. ATE IT. Fell straight on my ass, and not from being shit faced either. I was totally sober. But I'm a good sport, I didn't sue. Although I could have used some settlement cash...hahaha  The dance floor: OMG, too damn crowded and full of a lot of gross drunk horny desperate dudes. Yuck, save me! There was this one dude, shirt unbuttoned and all..just GAWKING at that poor go-go dancing girl. He probably thought he was so cool, with his boy chest hanging out and all. I could tell she wanted to kick his face in.  Oh, and the girls at the chaise above the bar who are all gyrating and grinding all up on each other was amusing at first, until I noticed they kept doing the same damn move like 100 times over. Les-bi-honest....that can get pretty monotonous, even for the horniest of horny dudes.",

I might as well wait at the regular line because it moved even faster than ours.  This club did not live up to my expectations.  I expected spacious dance floor, high ceiling, opulent decoration.  What I saw was a tiny dance floor that we could barely move.  The club itself was very small compared to XS and some others.  I felt claustrophobic being inside this place.  My girlfriend's foot got injured because people stepped all over us.  We left after 30 minutes.  It was definitely not one of our best experiences.  I want my money back.

It took nearly an hour and fifteen minutes for us to receive our food. We had to ask for a manager just to find out where our meals are, no communication was given to us about the delay in our meal. Finally our food came and still our waiter only came to pick up the plates. Then the manager came to give us the bill only because it was appropriate to give us a credit on our entrees.

    "text": "Oh, LAVO -- you gangsturr you.  From my past two experiences here, I have noticed that LAVO definitely has an affinity for hip-hop and dirty rap (Bay Area style!).  Although, this could also be because Three 6 Mafia came and performed last Sunday!  But don't get me wrong -- LAVO is every bit swanky, exquisite, and artistic.  It's no big-name club (like TAO or XS), but for such a humble size, LAVO is surprisingly fun all thanks to the rowdy, upbeat music and club goers.  Some downsides? [ - ] Dance floor is way too crowded [ - ] Raucous crowd = more drunk, perverted, grabby dudes  Solution?  I recommend getting a table / bottle service.  Both times my friends and I came here, we got bottle service for \"free.\"  This basically means that we didn't pay for the table, but instead gave a generous gratuity to our VIP host.  How? Find friends of friends who know people in Vegas or wait for LAVO promoters to approach you during the day.  Granted I've never eaten in their downstairs dining area, I'm sure their food is also noteworthy.  While we were upstairs, Christopher Mintz-Plasse (aka McLovin) dined with friends for his 21st birthday.",

It is also sort of just \"meh\". Having lived in New York where you can get amazing Italian food for one-tenth of the price, I was simply disappointed with the offerings at Lavo.  Nightclub - 3.5 stars The decor is gorgeous. I really liked the dark, sexy ambiance. The music was good. My main issue is that every time I've gone to Lavo, it has been VERY crowded, and it takes forever to get a drink. Other than that, it's a cool spot on the strip.",

All of a sudden, grown men become 13 year old blubbering teenage boys hypnotized by her beauty.  I'm totally serious.  No line, VIP table, and open bar.  Sweet.  LAVO is a perfect place to pre-party.  We walked in and the restaurant was absolutely beautiful.  We were told to go upstairs and I was surprised to find a really nice club area.  It's small and refreshingly not pretentious, but I can't imagine staying for the whole night.  It isn't a place to go people watch or expect to find the most beautiful people in Vegas, but it's definitely a kick-back place that you can let loose and start the night.  The music was awesome at first and I loved how it was a female DJ spinning.  However, the music got progressively worse and our 11pm-midnight VIP table with open bar expired.  That was our cue to exit and go cause some trouble elsewhere.  ;)  3.5 stars overall.",

    "text": "This place was gorgeous. I loved the ambiance, kind of reminded me of Tao. If you're looking for a place that's lively, loud, kind of loungy but at the same time wanna have a meal this is the place to go. It's not a place you want to go to if you actually want to have conversations with people if you're a group of 4 or more. It's just too loud so you end up only talking to the people right next to you.   Service was lousy! We were famished. We didn't even get complimentary bread until i had to ask for it 45 minutes later. It took an hour to get our food. I can understand if it's 30 minutes but 1 hour for food is long.   The food was good! BUT the portions were MASSIVE. We ordered the pre fix menu and typically you would think the portions would be smaller if it's a pre fix but not, these portions were just over overwhelmingly huge.  The Ceasar Salad they gave us could feed 5 people and it was for one person, my rice beef balls were tasty but there were 3 big balls and i was full from just eating that.   Now the Entree - the seabass was a good portion for one person. No complaints there and it was delish however, the other dishes, like hte chicken parmigan was the size of the entire plate. IT WAS HUGE. My friend and i were supposed to share it and we couldnt even eat 1/4 of that chicken.  Sadly that was a lot of food wasted.   The dessert was not good! The tiramisu was like hard rolls and again the quantity was just a lot. My recommendation is don't order any pre fix menu from this place.It''ll get VERY pricey. We paid $85 per person. That's absurdly expensive, i think. I recommend just ordering the individual entrees.",

The nightclub is a bit smaller but gets a good amount of crowded (not so much that you can't move but not so little that it's not fun).  We got passes from some promoter to get in free with free drinks until midnight (yes, being a group of girls in Vegas has its perks).  Then, later in the night, Lil' Jon was there to party with his entourage!!  Yes, I was starstruck.  Especially since the club is somewhat smaller and so it seems like you are partying with them.  I took a picture with him and one of his entourage members gave me a glass of free champagne!  AWESOME.  He also \"made it rain\" a couple times and I took a dollar that fell on the floor to keep as a memory hahha.  Supposedly Nick Carter was there celebrating his birthday too, but I didn't see him :(  Most people would not be upset by this, but considering I was in love with him most of high school, I can't believe I didn't see him and I can't believe my friend didn't tell me when she talked to him!!  All in all, a great time that will always be remembered.",

Fun spot for people watching.  The food is delicious! Lots to choose from.  The table I was with ordered, garlic bread, flat bread, salads, pastas, steak, mussels. I tried a bit of everything.  Loved the garlic bread with the tastiest tomato sauce for dunking the bread in. I would recommend it all.  I have 2 recommendations for this hot spot.  1. Make the online menu in larger print.  2. Update the prices on the wine list. We ordered a couple of glasses of Merlot before dinner and on the menu it says $10.00 when we got the bill we were charged $12.00. When we asked the waitress why, she said we only have $12.00 Merlot. They adjusted the bill with only a bit of attitude.  I will go back, In fact I went back the next night and ordered a glass of California wine $14.00, and the menu still has a $10.00 Merlot.  Tip: Always check your bill. I used to never check my bills until recently when I realized once I got home I paid more the ticketed price.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegaspersonalshopper.com%2Fdo-you-check-your-bill%2F&s=6a0435f94e587182f5adf071dc10d8cee320eb9457cf42b8f3ee793eea1226de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegaspersonalshopper.com...</a>",

They are rude, unreasonable, and stupid. They were constantly rousting everyone in the bathroom line to scoot over an inch like it was the biggest deal in the world. I'd be somewhat willing to put up with that at a big club, but Lavo is TINY. It would be much better suited as a lounge, and  would still be small for even that. There was no room on the little dance floor, and everyone kept getting stepped and spilled on. A basic, small rum and coke was $13...do not come here sober.  Only come here as a back up plan, and do anything you can to not pay cover because it is NOT worth it. You're better off taking that money to roulette.",

Either way, the food is decent, reminiscent of fancy bar food. The drinks were well-made, though I can imagine them taking a hit on quality when they are busy. The good news though, since Lavo is still relatively new, there are great comps to be enjoyed (like open bar nights).",

The place is nice, drinks are expensive, and the clientele was pretty much like you would expect at a club in Vegas.  I do have one complaint though, and to me, it's a big one (thus the 3 star rating). The DJ was bad. Best example of this is that I heard the same four Bon Jovi songs (or partial songs, I suppose it was a Bon Jovi mix) about 6 times in the 3 hours we were there. The first time was awesome, the second time was still fun, but after that, we were all thinking \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" Don't get me wrong, I love Bon Jovi, but it was excessive and took away from the experience.  I hope this was a fluke. I'll probably check out Lavo again next time in Vegas, but I'll be outta there pretty quick if I hear Bon Jovi on repeat...",

My criteria for a good club experience is simple- good music, somewhat friendly staff, convenient bar space, and decent layout/ambiance. Lavo has none of this.  We rented a table and were there with a group of about 20.  We were smushed upstairs behind the DJ booth and about 4 people could actually sit around said table. This was a Tuesday night  at midnight during CES so it was pretty packed, but if you allow someone to spend $1000+ on a table there should be space for people to move. That place is so tiny- I cant believe it is even considered a club. The music was TERRIBLE. I am not a lover of techno but I can tolerate any decent music with a good beat. It was the same ungst ungst ungst song on repeat.  I was wondering why the music was so god awful when they loudly announced the guest DJ for the night.....Kris Jenner (yes, the Kardashians mom) was spinning for us. WTF?? Why is Lavo paying her 20K to \"spin?\"  That explained a lot.  After about 20 minutes my friends and I decided our heads would explode if we stayed one minute longer and go to leave. Apparently, one of my friends walked on the \"wrong side of the rope\" as we were walking out and the bouncer grabber her arm and pulled her away. Then he rudely yelled at her to \"get the F out of here\".  I was stunned that this man/ogre had not only grabbed her little arm and shoved her but yelled at her. I stomped downstairs and told another man/ogre bouncer what happened and asked to speak to a manager.  He was nice (did not grab my arm and yell at me), but not helpful. I will never come back here. There are so many other fun clubs in Vegas (Marquee, XS, etc) don't waste your time at this one!!",

It felt more like a lounge than a club. Very laid-back. The music was mainly pop hits of today and some old school hip hop. The DJ was MIKEATTACK. He got better as the night went on. There was no house or EDM being played which made it boring in the beginning. I did dance later on in the night though. The bartender made me some nice drinks. They were strong! The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is for the less-than-exciting music (made it feel like a middle school dance party than a nightclub in Vegas) and the fact that the dance floor was so small. They also didn't do anything to bring the energy up in the club. Mainly, the music killed the vibe. I'd def go back...for the restaurant. Go to Marquee instead.",

While the meatball was still wonderful, my dinner was subpar - the scampi wasn't hot and it was overcooked.  My husband's dish, the bolognese was tasty but not special.  And unfortunately the service was just so so - with long periods of time before seeing our server.",

My bosses had streaks but I only had a dry salad and then the scallop appetizer for dinner. Amazing scallops!!!! My friend had Sea bass- also great!

We narrowed down dinner to Carnevino or Lavo ...on the walk down to Carnevino, we stopped to check out the menu at Lavo and we figured we'd consider it based on Carnevino's menu.  Their menu was a bit above what we were looking and thought we'd get a bigger bang for our buck here and yep...we did!!!  Our service was GREAT!!!  So our water cost $16, I said still water as I thought we'd get charged for sparkling but we still got charged but I'm not going to complain...moving on...we ordered a large ricotta stuffed meat ball for an appetizer.  I got the 8oz filet and polenta fries for a meal, and the oreo pizzole for dessert.  NO COMPLAINTS.  Seriously...this was probably the BEST Filet I've ever had...kicked the butt of Gibson's here in Chicago.  Everything was just to die for...  Looking for some fabulous eats in Vegas...GO HERE!!!!",

Melt in your mouth delicious. You've gotta go just for the meatball! Get it with ricotta. Perfection.  Thinking about the shrimp cocktail? It's amazing. The shrimps were HUGE but still not worth $8 each in my opinion. Fried shoestring zucchini was greasy but tasty.  For entrees, the seafood linguini was great, the penne all a vodka was perfectly al dente but too salty and too greasy. Not my favorite. Ambience was dark and cozy, romantic. Bathrooms were clean and trendy (except for the fact that there's a bathroom attendant--just my personal pet peeve).  I would definitely recommend this place. Get the meatball!",

I felt like the italian dishes were probably \"meh\" and nothing special but...   if I could sum it up, high roller, big baller:  I hope you like balls. Don't leave here without putting some balls in your mouth.  GET THE MEATBALL. Get the meatball. Get one. Get two. Get more. But really, taste the meatballs, because it's really what you should come to LAVO for.   Jokes aside. I had intense ordering regret when I had one taste of my friend's meatball (hah, hah).  Because I didn't order one, and so all I could think about while I ate my so-so bolognese was... I want more of his meatball!   We were seated outside on the balcony facing the Treasure Island show. Our waiter was hilarious- he claimed to be able to perform the whole thing, and I called him on it, so he lip synced perfectly to most of it. The drinks were good.   Overall message: get the balls.",

Nice decor and atmoshere, only complaint is the dining room was very cold and never get cold so for me to say that it had to be chilly. Service was good, friendly staff.   There are so many great Italian places in Vegas but I would repeat visit LAVO especially if I was staying at Venitian or Palazzo.",

He then left it there and left without a word. No \"sorry\" or anything.  3. Music is too darn loud. I came here to enjoy my dinner and company, not having to yell to have a conversation.   Will certainly not be coming back. I could have eaten better food for a cheaper price and better service elsewhere.",

She chose the cavatelli and I was not disappointed. It had a rich, meaty bolognese sauce that was amazing. The ricotta placed on top was the perfect compliment. I could eat this again anytime.  The chicken parmesan that my friends had was a huge portion. Although I didn't sample it, they said it was fabulous.  For dessert we all split their 20 layer chocolate peanut butter cake and the chocolate glazed rolled cake. Both were amazing. A decadent treat.  The music being played during dinner was a great mix. It was 80s new wave for the first half, then a DJ came and began playing some of my favorite EDM.  Great vibe for a restaurant and I will definitely return.",

    "text": "LAVO Brunch is so strange. It's pretty much ratchet night clubbing during the day. But don't get it twisted with Vegas pool parties; LAVO is on a whole 'nother level.  I really wanted to go day clubbing but Marquee Dayclub Dome was closed over the weekend and all other pool parties had ended for the season. When my promoter suggested LAVO Brunch, I hopped on the opportunity. None of my friends wanted to go, so it was just Craig P. and me.  We arrived around 3 pm and thanks to my promoter, both of us walked in for free without a wait. The moment we stepped in, I regret my decision. It was crazy inside. LAVO is an actual restaurant with dining tables all around. People were dressed to the nines, brunching, eating on dining tables, and DANCING on them, along with several go-go dancers. The restaurant is dimly lit, misty, and foggy inside. We weren't trying to get pussy misted at three in the afternoon so after a 5-minute walk-around, Craig and I were over it and bounced.  If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, then by all means, come and have fun! It's about $100-150 per person if you want a table, brunch, and bottles. But if you're looking for something more chill, like Marquee Dayclub or Encore Beach Club, LAVO is not the place.",

The very nice waiter offered another glass of wine and said the chef was offering truffle fries as a consolation for being so slow. The 2nd filet arrived and at best it was medium with a corner that was well. Note to chef/or the upstairs mass scale kitchen from which the food comes from: patrons who order medium rare center cut filets  with asparagus sides are not interested in fries. They went uneaten. It's Las Vegas. I should have gone to the far superior B&B Ristorante but was enticed by the outdoor terrace. Never again.",

We started with the beef carpaccio and calmari. Both were flavorful and delicious. The entrees at the table included chicken marsala and a couple of pastas. Every dish had good flavor and the portions were enough without being too much. We finished with the sorbets which were all very good. The atmosphere was very lively and definitely gets more lively as the night goes on.",

    "text": "I don't eat at expensive restaurants too often, so this dinner was a rare occurrence (work-related) and I approached this dining experience with high expectations. Long story short, I left a bit conflicted.   Parking: Located inside the Palazzo, I assume parking simply goes through the hotel's parking structure. In which case, ample spots. However, you have to consider the walk unless you opt for valet, which leaves you only a short escalator ride away.   Service: Although well-mannered and attentive (refilling bread and water glasses), there were some fumbles with wrong and/or delayed orders. I do recognize that this could happen in any restaurant on any day, but this was still unfortunate.   Food: To start, the bread was delicious. From there, things were slightly hit-or-miss for my palette. A friend ordered the Tuna Tartare (with yellowfin tuna and avocado; $22) that no one particularly cared for. Not bad, just didn't have you craving for another bite. Next course, I went with the Spaghetti and Meatballs (Imperial Wagyu and Fresh Ricotta; $34). Without a doubt, one of the heartiest pastas I've had, as I only made it through 3/4 of my meal. Again, it was good, but not sure worth $34. Lastly, I was treated to a free fried Oreo dessert (by checking-in) that probably didn't do this place justice. After a couple lackluster bites, I just finished off the ice cream and passed the dessert to anyone willing to have it.   Overall, nothing really amazed me about LAVO, but nothing truly killed my experience either. 3-Stars for an entirely average experience.",

    "text": "Saturday night dinner, April 30. We had a reservation in place for weeks.  Had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table. The reservation apparently meant nothing.  We checked back with the hostess stand a couple of times, and she was completely dismissive. Not rude, exactly. Just was completely tuned out.  The manager at that point gave us a free round at the bar, which is a nice gesture but doesn't actually solve the problem of waiting so long for a table.  So, thanks for the effort, but that's just not responsive to the problem. We don't want to stand at the bar anymore with drinks. We're hungry.  The food was OK. The meatball appetizer was awesome. My steak was average by Vegas standards (although not super expensive, so that's good), the caesar salad had nice flavor but the lettuce looked like just chopped up romaine only a step or two above Subway lettuce. the gnocchi was really not good. Very mushy in an unpleasant way.  This gnocchi put the \"no\" in gnocchi.  The pacing of the meal was awful and really impacted our experience negatively. We probably waited an hour for our food after ordering. The waitress left us for long periods of time, I think to avoid us asking about out food. A roving manager asked if everything was going well, and we had to bluntly tell him \"no\".  Then, lo and behold, our food appears almost immediately.  Who knows if it was in the hot window or what.  The atmosphere was really upbeat, loud and fun. Our dates looked beautiful, and it was a sexy environment for the mid-30s crowd. This restaurant got everything right except the being-seated-and-getting-food part.",

Was in Vegas for a bachelorette party this past weekend and the bouncers outside were very nice and invited us to come up for free drinks! At first we thought what's the catch? Literally no catch.   Awesome bar upstairs playing very cool music, hip hop and top 40s, the stuff you hear on the radio right now, so if that's not your vibe you might not like it. You would think you would have to wait a long time to get these free drinks? But you don't, walked right up to the bartender and within minutes had drinks in our hands. Of course always tip the bartenders well, they're still making you awesome drinks even though they're free. A few group of girls would not leave tips and I find that extremely rude! Definitely fun place to get the party started!",

Great place to get the night started.   Service is mediocre. Wrong entries given to people. Missing items. I had a fork dropped on me at one point. Tried most of the menu. Other Than a few standouts most of the menu was lack luster. Loved the fried oreos for dessert. Loves the fried zucchini fries for a side. You can't mess up sea bass. Garlic bread. Meatballs. All very good. Lots of veggie options.   I will be back. But like I said. I do not come here for the food.",

Arrived in time for our reservation, was greeted by an unpleasant hostess who told us that they would text us when our table was ready... We proceeded to wait a half hour (unacceptable for a reservation) and were then seated. We were placed at a table with hardly any room for the insane foot traffic to pass behind our seats. I was personally elbowed in the head (?? Not kidding!), My chair was banged into repeatedly.  As if this were not enough, our waiter was rude and non existent.  We waited 20 minutes for any attention from him, our water glasses were empty for half an hour before we flagged down someone else to fill them.  He NEVER returned to our table after dropping the food and running away.  We got the calamari which was excellent, the carbonara which was also very good and the eggplant parmagiana which has cold in the center and awful. Didn't even touch it.  This is simply ridiculous for a Las Vegas upscale restaurant, I frequent this area and only dine in upscale restaurants here, I have NEVER had such a horrible evening at a restaurant here.  Very disappointing, we sat finished with our dinner for another half hour and the waiter never came back to clear, ask about dessert or present the check, no matter how often we tried to flag him down.  Finally we got another server to bring us our check.  I asked her if she was able to see us?? I actually believed we were invisible.  As you can see from the length of this review I will never return to this restaurant and highly suggest you do not go here.  If s restaurant had the gall to charge me $25 for a meatball, they had better provide stellar service and as for the eggplant - this is Italian food 101... If you can't make that, you shouldn't be in business.",

Garlic bread that comes out is really good, didn't quite understand why a table of 2 got a whole loaf, and our party of 7 only got one complimentary, then we were charged for additional ones. The entrees were just okay.  I got the Chicken Parmigiana, it was a very large portion, but I needed extra sauce to eat with it due to it being pretty dried out.  I also got mashed potatoes on the side, again another dried out dish in which I had to add marinara sauce to. My husband got a spicy seafood pasta, again just okay.  There was no spice to it at all and again it was just okay.  I expected a lot more for a restaurant specializing in Italian fair.  We ate at another Italian restaurant two nights before that was a lot better and less expensive then here.",

The club has perfect access from the parking structure garages, very close (which is always helpful when you wear \"cute, un-walkable\" shoes) lol .  The club music was ok, but overall, I will definitely go back! Lots of fun.  We had bottle service and the table was nestled privately in a small hallway, next to an elevator exit, it was quite intimate, but not ideal seating for more than 4 people. Make sure you get ahold of a VIP host to get you in and taken care of.  Tipping & being polite is always the secret to BETTER FASTER service",

You can't see sh*t...upstairs 2.) Well... It's under same management so duh.    But it's also about 1/6th the size of Tao (I'm talking about the 2nd floor) making this place tiny to maneuver around.  That said, it's a very nice venue with splashes of blue compared to Tao's red decors, and lotsa bikini-top-wearing pole/go-go dancers to liven things up.  It definitely feels more upscale than Tao.  The lower restaurant/hookah lounge (offered after midnight) area is definitely more AIRy and nicer with softer whites and wooden pieces.    Biggest surprise was we were expecting hell to get into the club only to be pleasantly surprised at how easy and quick(and free for Venetian/Palazzo guests) it was for us to get in...just put your name on the guestlist ahead of time.  Possibly THE nicest bouncers I've ever encountered anywhere.  Seriously, these guys know how to treat people with respect and we even made some funny small talk with a few of them, and including the executive host.  None of that strict 1:1 ratio that Tao always pesters you with.    Music was so-so on the dance floor.  Not a big fan of house music and it got crowded quick.  Getting back into the club couldn't be any easier though surprisingly.  Problem is it gets hot upstairs so we resorted to the lounge area  downstairs where it's airy and they played better music.  And it's just way too small.  But you can club hop between Tao and Lavo for free so that's not bad and they offer hookah tables.",

Nightclub Review: 1. four stars. staff is sharp and attractive, courteous and positive, even the \"bouncers\" were genuinely courteous. whoever does the hiring and training here should get a raise and a promotion. if you go clubbing often, you know this is rare. their staff is superb. sound system is clean and crips... not ear shattering. the only reason i did not give this place five stars is the size and layout. it's a bit small for a vegas experience. whoever runs lavo nightclub is doing a great job.",

The marinara, well, marinara dipping sauce.  I ordered the lobster, asparagus risotto.  Lightly battered asparagus, (asked for no pine nuts) and tons of lobster! Searing hot, when served, I was not disappointed.  The broccoli, bitter, but still crisp.  The sides, all hearty (but hardly heart healthy) portions.  Tasty in their own right, but nothing prepared nor flavored or garnished in any any way that would set it apart from even a middle of the road local family restaurant.  More stylized-Vegas-fusion.  I left after dinner and did not visit the nightclub. I would not be upset if I were invited to dine there again.

The start of a fantastic Sunday night.  Aside from waiting in line for so long (a girl just behind us literally passed out whilst waiting in line, causing the bouncers to freak out due to their lack of any healthcare or general well-being knowledge whatsoever, so awkward...), the place still wasn't all that impressive and certainly not worth the 2.5 hour wait. The girls and I got in on some promoter's free Belvedere bottle service, so I asked for a glass on the rocks. This was another huge mistake on my part, due to the fact that it tasted like rubbing alcohol and certainly was NOT Belvedere in any way, shape, or form. The music wasn't awful, but the DJ needs a little work on blending tempos and also needs to open up the music library so as to not loop the music every 75 minutes. The atmosphere was interesting to me, but this may have been due to my unfamiliarity with clubs in Vegas.  My advice: bring a large group of women, tell the douchey bouncers right away that you are there, and enjoy skipping the line altogether. If you are a male, find one of these groups of women and latch on hard.",

Nothing wrong with it, nice atmosphere, good service, decent food.  But that's it. The club, on the other hand, was great.  We were there on a Wednesday night, so most other clubs weren't exactly buzzing.  This place was.  It was busy, yet the servers were always there for you.  Drinks were good, I wasn't paying so of course they tasted extra good.  I would definitely come here when in Vegas again.  For dinner though, I'd find another spot first.  P.S. Don't wash your hands in one of those Roman style sinks in the hallway...I know they are already turned on for you, but you will not find paper towels to dry them off with...;)",

The food was just ok, have tasted better tapas in numerous other places. I tried the kobe beef balls, kobe sliders, grill octopus salad, sea bass and clam linguine. None of those amazed me or stayed in my tongue memory. The chocolate bread pudding was the best part of the whole dinner.   I had fun staring at the people walking back and forth the stairs/ bridge to the club so i checked it out after dinner. It has a bar area and a dance floor area with some booths. I guess it would be ok if you're hanging out with your own group of friends and is looking for something less hectic than the bigger clubs. The crowd cleared out pretty fast because of the size of this place i suppose, and not many people there after 1am on a Saturday night.",

How do I rate the restaurant on food service, location or decor?  Food wAs average,  the wait for a table inside was an hour, the location and view on the hot patio was amazing but itS 90 at night and too hot to eat.  The decor is supposed to be a Turkish bath leading up to the club on the second flooR. Cool bar nice lounge.  I hear its a small intimate club but nice.   But wez here to eatz.  So, my friend lives here and says they're known for their balls.  Huge meatballs! !! Really with the heat we were full with that and the yummy garlic bread. It was a huge 4\" meatball with Italian grown toMatos. Its just large not that tasty. I prefer small and tasty cuz really size isn't everything.  Then I had eggplant rigatoni. H'm whatever a little over salty a little dry and like most Italian I feel I make better at home. Prices are reasonable, meatball with whipped ricotta $20. Rigatoni $24.  Waiter was nice.  The benefit of sitting outside waS watching the cheesy. siren show at the TI. it seemed very similar to the pirate battle.     We were too full to eat our food, so we asked them to box it. Remember my friend lives here.  The buss boy not understanding, since he's esl, stacked our food and tossed it. We only had two bites literally.  So the waiter says sorry, it's tossed.  If you want to wait it'll be a while.  OKAY. We'll wait. I'm still drinking my champagne anyways. So they prepared both all over so he can have leftovers. ;) I thought it was funny. The waiter was cool about it.  Food taste average, but overall experience adds an extra gold star.",

The only other outstanding club restaurant would be Tao. Tao is amazing! Tao Beach is a pool party with unreal food so this company has their sh-t together. This property is a little more high end boutique, but any one could have a great night here.  The food is fantastic. If you've heard mixed reviews in the past the food use to be Mediterranean but it's now home cooked Italian style. I've heard several people say, \"I usually have fried calamari, but this is unreal.\" Yum! The Salmon is the best! Now I'm pretty hungry.  Lavo is a little more strict when it comes to dress code. I have seen several people in t-shirts get turned away. Sandals on men or gym shoes are also not allowed.   Sundays DJ Vice performs. He is one of the most well known resident DJ's in a town that has the most famous DJ's in the world constantly performing. He plays the top 40's which everyone wants to hear but he also plays some old school music as well. He scratches which I don't hear or see many DJ's do. Late night he plays more house techno music. He plays to the mood and sets the mood at the club.",

Our group was able to snag 4 rounds within an hour. And YEA Redbull is considered a FREE rail drink!   2) although i wasnt a big fan of trance/house the dj was awesome. he played some top 40 and we were able to go with it throughout the night. there's also a downstairs portion that plays rnb but it wasn't as lively in terms of crowd.  the only downside? the only bathroom they had in the restaurant was downstairs.

We had a bunch of my sorority sisters join us sometime into the night, and the security guards were awesome about it, we just told them the name of our table and my girlfriends got in right away! And there was free drinks for ladies w/wristband from 11-12 which worked out well, though it was only well vodka, but mixed with sour mix and soda I can hardly tell the difference.

When walking in you can see the restaurant part. Then you walk up a set of stairs and a hallway with a bunch of sinks lined across. I wasn't sure if it was just for decorations or for people to puke in while leaving the place at night. lol! I kept wondering how could there be a restaurant and a club in one, wouldn't it be too loud? But it wasn't! It was amazing how both sides placed completely different music but couldn't hear it from each side.   This is a pretty small club compared to others in Vegas but it was a good size. We got a big booth that was right behind the DJ booth. They had sunglasses layer out with the DJ's name on it and the service was great. Our waitress was so attentive and made sure that we always were stocked with shots and chasers.   The music was great here and the people were friendly. everyone was having a good time. I love that there are little cubbies for the girls to put their coats and bags inside. And they were hidden so people couldn't just see them out in the open. They gave out a bunch of glow sticks for people to wave around and L.M.F.A.O even made an appearance here!! The crowd went wild! It was a great night for me!",

And what in the world do you think you're doing making that thing actually taste really good?

I was confused on where the water/sink water flow was but the attendant told me just step on the pedal....and out of nowhere the water fell straight down from the ceiling.. I thought that was very neat and original.. Two thing though: you get splashed by the water while washing your hands unless you put them deep in the basins and the mirrors get splashed like crazy.. We talked to the attendant.. and she has to clean those mirrors every time they are splashed! how horrendous!  I can't imagine when the club is poppin' and you have to deal with all these drunkards and those sinks!  At least it was cool though just like the neat bathrooms at tao.  Service was Excellent! We had probably 5 people total kept asking us if we were okay and if food was good.. I really liked the people working there.. Very friendly and smiley.  Our waiter took perfect pictures of us, which is a plus because you don't know how many people I've asked to take pictures for us around vegas, and they don't know how to take pics at all with no background and everything!!!  The part where I was amazed was the hanging hooks underneath the tables for your purses!  I thought those were really neat! But risky at the same time, Don't forget your purses at the end of the night!!!  We had the crispy artichokes and sirloin platters.. They were amazing.  The artichokes were sprinkled with lemon juice, making it a bit sour but perfect for the final taste.  Sirloin platter were rolls of beef with melted cheese inside.. We made the mistake of not eating that first or together with the artichokes because it ended up being a bit cold when we got to it!  no cocktails for us because of the previous night debaucheries at the Bank... I was drinking that ice water like a thirsty camel all dinner long..  Decor: amazed me.. dimmed lights.. shades of brownish orange lighting.. I really like the atmosphere and lounge area.. spacious.. different..maybe i should check out the nightclub this weekend..  Great experience at LAVO!!!",

From what I could remember there's three bars, one dance floor, a DJ booth, and a VIP area behind the DJ booth.  I'm not fans of nightclubs with multiple levels where the only means of venturing to these levels are stairs. Stairs and heels are not your best friends. Stairs, heels, and intoxication equals bad news bears.  The whole time I was at LAVO... I thought I was at TAO. I had a blast at LAVO... so imagine all the fun I would have at TAO.   I absolutely loved the music the DJ played. Mainstream Top 40 with a mixture of old school hip hop. I'm a dancing machine and I don't think I ever danced for four hours straight-- nonstop.",

    "text": "Interestingly enough we actually enjoyed our stay at Lavo.   My friend, Anne, and I just finished watching Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian and they gave us complimentary drinks at Lavo. Niiice. I love free drinks but neither one of us has ever been to that place. It was a pleasant surprise that Lavo's interior is stunning! We adored the lighting, the Moroccan decor and even the coziness of the place. A perfect place to talk about the Phantom! We got our drinks, Midori Sour (yummy!) for both of us and sat at one of the comfy sofas while waiting for our hubbies. By the way, drinks are $11 to $13 for specialty drinks. Normal for Vegas standards.  We didn't wanna leave so we persuaded our hubbies to stay for dinner and boy did we made the right decision. The Kobe beef appetizer was divine but I fell in love with Heirloom(?) tomato salad. The prices was a bit steep but we expected it from a restaurant such as this one. Plus the fact that we're from the Bay Area where everything is overpriced, this is priced just right for us. Their appetizers run from $15 to $22, not bad since the ones we got are big enough to be shared by four, as long as you treat it as an appetizer and not the entree.   The entrees came and I love love love my Veal Parmegiana (photos uploaded). I think it's priced around $28. Not bad since it's HUGE! Hubby ordered Seafood linguine ($22) which was just ok. A little on the salty side for my taste but hubby liked it. Huge serving again by the way. Anne's hubby ordered Lobster Risotto and it was just ok too and Anne got the Salmon with artichokes. I forgot the names but I tasted hers and I liked it too. Expect to pay around $22 to $35 for the entrees.  Our server is super nice. He was attentive and light hearted. He was able to answer all our questions and his suggestions were sound. We're not what you call upscale clientele but he made us feel that way. Unless of course he though we were because we were pretty that night. Hehe just kidding! There was also a guy going around asking people if we want to join the dance club upstairs. He said there won't be any cover charge since we already had our dinner there. Smart guy. He also stamped our wrists already so we won't have to fall in line. Purrrfect!  Ok here comes the bad. The dance club is baaad in my opinion. The hall on the way there is amazing but the actual dance floor is so disappointing! Even the music is BAD! It was crowded at 11pm but nobody was dancing. It only took us a second to wonder why. Everybody was asking for numbers and guys hawking to hook up. WTH? This is dance club people!  I'm giving Lavo the benefit of the doubt, maybe we came at wrong night. We were out of there in less than 5 minutes.  Instead we spent another couple of hours at  their lounge area outside. We enjoyed it there immensely. Just chatting, people watching and having smokes. It was the perfect end to a really nice day.  Will we come back to Lavo? Definitely. Check out the photos we uploaded.",

I finished my pepsi and asked for another, but they wanted to charge me for another drink. Seriously? We spent over $500 here for dinner and you want to nickel and dime me for a pepsi? I hate it when places do that.  The food finally came and it was just so-so. I had the penne seafood alfredo and it was nothing special at all. I was disappointed and expected more since Tao is so amazing. The service was okay. I wish we had chosen another place for dinner that night.",

Cost us $575 total for 5 guys and we got grey goose and our choose of drinks.

HOLY MACARONI. your nightclub was so crowded it was so bad. Up to a point my body was dancing by itself because people were squeezing me left and right. Drinks were spilled all over the floor. Slippery much? is this a club or ice skating rink? Dance? what dance? I can hardly move and breathe. AND COME ON! THOSE STAIRS? don't you know we girls wear at least 5 inches of high heels? ugh.

We were wedged in between a large corner both and another small table. The music was so loud we could barely hear each other.  My bf asked if we could move and we were immediately reseated with a smile, no attitude. Our new table was a lot better.   My bf had the seared grilled tuna with with artichoke hearts & loved it.  I had the 8 oz filet and it was good, nothing outstanding though. Keeping in mind this is an Italian restaurant but it seemed the focus was not on Italian food.  This could of influenced our food choices, trying to be fair.  We split a caprese type salad and it was excellent.  The service was friendly and very attentive.  We had several servers attending to us which was excellent except it made the dining experience less formal and we had quite a few interruptions.",

FOOD: Special app - Not sure of the exact name, but it was a pizza dough brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with roasted garlic, oregano and salt, topped with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, greens and onions.  O-M-G delish!!  Spaghetti with Kobe meatballs - Very good taste.  Would've eaten more but was so full off the app and bread.  SERVICE: We walked in without any reservations and got seated within 15 minutes or so on a Friday night.  Our female server was friendly.    OVERALL: I love the atmosphere but it may be a little too loud (music-wise) for some.  Food was good.",

A local had recommend this spot to party at, and he even got my entire party on the list. Seems to be rare, since guys pretty much always have to pay, and we were excited to spend our cover money on drinks than entry.   The nightclub was just right on the inside. Modern in style, this place was big enough without being overwhelming. It felt very comfortable for us to post up in the middle of the dance floor and dance until they closed down... Which seems like around 4:30am.  Drinks seem to be the average going rate for Vegas clubs, which is obviously pretty high. On the upside, they definitely make a stiff drink, and it wasn't long before I was plastered. There seemed to be a much better mix of people here than at other clubs.   Good music, atmosphere, drinks, and friends made Lavo a favorite Vegas memory to add to the bank. I will definitely be back.",

This is NOT one of those just skimming by... this restaurant is FANTASTIC!  We had a group of 14... which understandably can be a pain. They accommodated us  without hesitation, but that was just the start of it. Our server (I wish I caught his name) was outstanding. He was on top of it, gave great recommendations and even gave us a coupon from the hotel book for half off a magnum bottle of champagne (who does that?!).    Next... the food... umm wow. We had a bunch of appetizers (oysters, crab legs, flatbread, GARLIC BREAD). All delicious. There are 2 things you MUST try (not optional in my opinion)... the KOBE MEATBALLS... yeah... I dont even know how to describe how good they were and DEEP FRIED OREOS, well you can imagine what that deliciousness might be like.   We had such a great experience that I had to ask for the manager after dinner... Jason was awesome and gave me his card and said not to hesitate to let him know if we needed anything else. This guy clearly knows how to do good business.  I honestly cant recommend this restaurant enough... it is now my go to for all vegas trips!",

Got there, we were like 10 mins early, sat at the bar, chatted it up with the lovely Christian, got some drinks and bing right on time our reservation is ready. Hot damn!  We sit down, have a lovely waitress who is all smiles and is aiming to please [remind you she's female we are all female and she was still super duper nice]. We order, get more drinks, say hi to the manager who looks like superman, bread and appies arrive-LIFE IS GOOD.  Ok garlic bread [yes you are probably going to make out with some random later, so bring gum] b/c this bread is worth it!  Kobe stuffed RICE BALLS- there is a god.  These things are FREAKING amazing-like foodgasm good, calamari yummie, and flatbread pizza also very good.  I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad, this thing is huge [that's what she said], so share it.  IT was again way too much food. My other friend and I split Kobe meatballs and spaghetti, well that was so amazing, she's eaten meatballs everyday since just to try and pretend they were the same.  My other girlfriend who weighs about 100 lbs soaking wet got Eggplant Parmigiana. OK dude she was going to make out with it at the table, she said and I quote 'the is the best eggplant Parmigiana I have ever had IN MY LIFE\" she said it like 5 times so I'm fairly confident she meant it. She was also devising ways in which she could take the rest of it home, stick it in her going out bag, and eat it after we went to the club. She was distraught, to say the least, that she was not able to bring it with her for later.  We finish eating and literally roll our happy asses upstairs; whereby, we are escorted to our table and are assigned a wonderfully nice man by the name of Tony who is our security guard for the night. Tony is a miracle worker, basically he boots bad men away from you [A+] and when you have to use the ladies, he escorts you every time himself, flashlight in toe and hand delivers you to the restroom. THEN, bless his heart, waits for you and escorts you back so you don't have to deal w/ shoving people out of your way. OH WHAT A LOVELY CONCEPT!  We had an A+ time here seriously, service was impeccable, price was right, and we all can't wait to do round 2!",

What is there not to like when its easy for girls to get in for free, guys get in for free if there is a 1:1 ratio as long as the girl is on gl, and girls get open bar until midnight!  The weekend before xmas, we went on a Sunday during DJ Vice who ALWAYS kills it on the tables! I love the fact that they always throw out them cool glowsticks, there's confetti or foam that shoots out, and the fog! Whenever theres fog, it just makes the experience better! It wasn't as crowded, but there definitely enough people to make the spot poppin!  New Years Day, It was a Tuesday and it was industry night. The line was ridiculously long but we still all managed to get in for free and waited for about 20 minutes? This time around the club was much more crowded than last Sunday I went but it was still a great time. Of course they came back with the glowsticks, foam and they gave us another New Years countdown!! Dj Lema and special guest Dj Chuckie, killed the tables! Before I knew it, I looked and it was 3:30am!  Lavo nightclub is the spot to be if you looking for a cross between mega club (xs, marquee) and lounge (ghostbar).  Spent: Free.99",

I thought it as a bit pricey (but hey, it is vegas), and the service was slow... we had to go to the bar in between drinks to continue getting drinks.   We went up to the club afterward which was crowded, but there were lots of cheesy things that happened... shooting streamers, etc. Wasn't a huge fan of that. I'd go back for the food, but prob not to the club.",

It's an upstairs club the decor is much nicer (comes with LED lights etc.) but overall pretty small compared to the rest of the clubs in Vegas.",

Garlic bread tasty but a little crunchy. Appetizer Kobe rice balls, a little dense for my taste but very flavorful. Appetizer clams oreganato fantastic...hot, clams perfectly cooked with a nice toasted breadcrumb topping, great garlic sauce...I wanted to lick the plate.  My wife had the penna ala vodka...just o.k. We don't mind el dente, but her penne took el dente to a ridiculous level. And it was undersauced. Spaghetti and Kobe meatballs...delicious. Gelato for dessert...the chocolate was awesome, caramel good and vanilla bean o.k. Portions are large and priced reasonably.",

    "text": "Get.a.meatball. (More about this later).  What an awesome experience and beautiful restaurant!! I really cannot say enough about what a wonderful dinner we had - the service was amazing, the food was perfect and it was just a great place for a date night on our last night in Vegas. While we opted not to sit on the patio, it looked lovely and with a fun view of the strip - so I would recommend checking it out if you are a patio person (which I am but it was a bit warm that night). Now, let's return to that meatball I mentioned...  We started with the Meatball with Whipped Fresh Ricotta and OH MAN - the ricotta was amazing!! And the meatball - fantastic flavor, incredibly tender and seriously, I could have ordered another one for my meal lol. However, we decided to really splurge and had a couple of steaks: the 14 oz New York Strip (with garlic herb butter) and the 20 oz Bone-in Rib Eye. Both were cooked perfectly and the flavor was phenomenal - even without the garlic butter. And as if that wasn't ENOUGH food, we also got a side of the Garlic Mashed Potatoes and the Brussel Sprouts - both were amazing and the portions are BIG so while this may sounded like a small army eating, there were 2 of us and we did not come close to eating all of this but it did make for a great late night snack later! (1 side is more than enough to feed 2 people but I like to have options)  I highly recommend Lavo if you are in Vegas - especially for a date night but I did see several tables of what I will assume were girl's night out and it would be a perfect spot for that and groups. It would definitely be on my list to return to on my next trip to Vegas!",

Before I get into it, I want to mention that it is a bit pricy (about $40 for the brunch and $15 extra for the endless alcoholic drinks).  Brunch consisted of an extravagant three course meal. The dessert course was arguably the best course, not just for the sweet treats, but it was all you can eat! The mimosas tasted like perfection, not too light and not too strong, certainly worth the extra fee. Among great food, excellent service, and delicious mimosas, the VIEW that LAVO's location provides is the aspect that makes this restaurant worth going to. Customers have the choice of sitting inside or outside on the patio, but both seatings allow you to watch the Bellagio water show up close and personal. Definitely consider LAVO as your go-to brunch destination when in Vegas!",

My husband also said it to our server when we were there.  But there was nothing done for it.  I watched other tables get Birthday desserts but we didn't get anything.   Our server was in training and she should have been working more closely with the main server.  He was great but we didn't see him as often.  She seemed nervous which I understand but this is an expensive meal.   Everything took a very long time    We ordered everything  at one time and she asked me if I wanted the salads with the appetizer or after.  I said after and 20 min later it all came together.   Then 40 min later our dinners came. The meat was cooked ok but was incredibly salty and charred on the outside.  It came with a weird sauce, roasted garlic and lemon on the plate , not sure why.  I tried a couple times to ask what the sauce was and no one answered me.   Weird to put a bbq like sauce with a beautiful filet.   Once our table was cleared off completely we waited and waited for our server to come back so we could go    She came back 20 min later with dessert menus we said no thank you just the bill.    She then went to her other table a few times and finally brought the bill.    In the end I was happy they forgot my birthday dessert because I just wanted to go.    I give huge credit to the bussers though   Water always filled and plates cleared quickly.   I wish we had picked a different restaurant to have my nice birthday dinner.    Calamari is bland with plain marinara sauce  Salads were just ok.  Nothing special  (Caesar, Louie, beets)  Decor is gorgeous",

The chicken dish was very large, but served without pasta. Our server suggested I add a side of pasta, a la carte, with red sauce. However, the side of pasta seemed drowned in olive oil, as that was all I could taste. I never got the chance to have the pasta remade before finishing the chicken, so I just asked that it be taken off. My friend, however, received a complimentary slice of quite decadent tiramisu for his birthday, which was a lovely ending to our experience. All in all, the restaurant is nice and some of the food IS tasty, but I feel nothing stood out much and there ARE better choices for this price range elsewhere in Vegas.",

We split a number of dishes, beet salad, minestrone soup, kobe beef meatballs with spaghetti and chicken parmigana.  Minestrone soup was the only thing that was mediocre.  The rest was delicious.  Waiter pushed us to order Oreo Beignets, tasted like an Oreo funnel cake.  The sinks are really awesome.  Night club was cool, but nothing insane",

The special was a 34 oz piece of meat (OMG! for a vegetarian I almost passed out) they suggest you share it, yeah with like 6 people!!! Anyway, the food was very good, I had the vegetarian spaghetti.  The bread was super yummy, the cocktails good, they have outside seating which we wished we had taken advantage of because the HORRIBLE, earth shaking, DJ spun Techno music was unbearable. I sat on the booth/bench side of the table with my back to the bar - the seat shook the whole time - I guess it saved me a quarter for a vibrating bed, but shoot we were having dinner not clubbing!",

Unfortunately, the promoter said my boyfriend would only have to pay 15 bucks and then right when we got to the club, he told my boyfriend it's actually 30..grrr   I went on a Saturday and it was free drinks for ladies until 11:30 :D Drinks are pretty standard (cranberry vodka, vodka + redbull), but I'm not really picky when it comes to drinks.   Everything that happened after drinking a ton is kind of a blur, but I do remember that the dance floor is pretty cramped. I almost lost my purse because someone rammed into me and I dropped my purse on the floor. My friend was able to retrieve it for me, thank goodness.   Other than the limited space, I really liked this club. Music was mostly mainstream, hip-hop stuff which is my favorite thing to dance to. The crowd was around my age (early 20s) and I saw some mid/late 20s people as well. The energy of the crowd was really upbeat and fun which makes dancing a 100 times better.   Unfortunately, my group got kicked out early (around midnight) because my friend got too drunk and sat on the floor.   I would totally go back to this club, not for the decor or the space or the HYPE or anything. But just because it's a great place to just go and dance til your feet are so sore, you can hardly walk back to your hotel.",

I knew the bath house idea would be short-lived.  Just not appetizing.  When I think bath house I think either fat, hairy european men lounging around naked or sweating in saunas or I think of another even less appealing vision that I'm sure y'all probably were also thinking.  Anywho...  Yeah, so the original chef was some cocky douche from LA who was dumped almost immediately after the grand opening.  He was doing the small plates/mezze thing.  His food was okay, but the room was too loud and clubby and not really conducive to eating overpriced, mediocre, cliched grub, or eating at all.  Very loud and annoying.  Fast forward to last week and I thought I'd give it another shot and voila!  A fine restaurant had arisen like a phx from the bath house's ashes!  Nothing earth-shattering original here, just good Italian grub.  I can't remember what I ate, but the room is stunning, the mood has been chilled, the service was right the hell on and the vittels were scrumptious.  Nice save, Tao Group.",

Ladies you can get a 2 ladies in free flyer at Tao - so get there early and you dont pay.  It also says on the club flyer that its a bathouse. Um NO. I got kicked out of line for wearing rhinestone open toed shoes in flip flop style. OK a girl with ugly kitten heel flea market flip flops got in and I didn't? WTF. I explained the the very cool bouncer who was going to let me in - since I was just meandering around alone - look the flyer said bath house, I have heels, but I have my hot-piece suit on under and I can put my heels on. I was even going to tip the guy for putting me in GList line.  So I step to the side for 2 minutes, show him my fabulous heels and then I am told that they are at max capacity and I can wait in their lounge. I think it was some senior bouncer that cut me off. What a load of crap. I dont know - did they not like my flossy Obama top? I was already stamped for entry - WTF?  Lavo - awash.",

    "text": "WOW. That's pretty much all I can say about LAVO Nightclub. I'm a Chicagoan and took a mid-December trip to Vegas with the girlfriend. Next time I gotta go with the fellas.  LAVO is everything I expected in a Las Vegas nightclub. Packed House. Huge, Lavishly decorated interior. GORGEOUS women dressed in their best outfits. GREAT mix of music (Top 40 basically, rap, pop, r&b hits). Diverse Crowd. The night (which was a Friday) I went Kid Cudi was there and took the mic to perform a couple songs, which was dope. Me and my girl got some free passes on the strip from a young lady, so be on the look out. (DISCLAIMER: If someone is trying to SELL you free passes, DO NOT buy them. You can either find someone giving them away for free on the strip or go directly to the club during the day and pick some up.)  Its hard to find a party in Chicago with that many people having so much fun. I would suggest having more than a few drinks because as my buzz wore off I became more and more annoyed at how body-to-body crowded it was. But I still had a ball there and I definitely have to go back!",

The club was extremely crowded that drinks got spilled on me multiple times, I got elbowed in the head, and pushed around by couples all night.

If you don't like the first bite, put your fork down and send it back, otherwise the chef will probably use 'something else' for mayo.",

I went to the night club part the other day for a pre-NHL Awards event. A promoter put me on his guest list, so I got in right when it opened and enjoyed the open vodka bar. I will note that \"open vodka bar\" means free watered down vodka over ice for ladies. Whatever. It's free!  The music's pretty good, the club is pretty small, but it's a pretty cool spot. There's a little stage behind the VIP booth where girls can get up and dance around, plus some special platforms for dancers hired by the club. It's definitely one of the nicer nightclubs in Vegas. I'd like to try the restaurant next!",

We got to the restaurant and were seated promptly.  The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous.  Our server brought all of us a shot and then we all ordered a cocktail.  The drinks were delicious.  Then they brought out a variety of different food options: Chicken Parmesan, Margherita Pizza, two different kinds of pasta (one gluten free pasta), among others.  The amount of each dish was quite large, but I expected that since it is an Italian place.  Overall, the food was amazing we enjoyed all of it.  After dinner, we went back outside to wait for the nightclub to open.  One of the promoters outside combined our group of 7 ladies with another group of 5 ladies and gave comped us a table with free bottle service.  The service was great and even though it was a Sunday night the atmosphere was still fun.  Unfortunately, some of the ladies we were with and some of the guys at the table next to us started smoking.  Something my sister and I were not a fan of so we took off.

Yea, that's right!  I really expected better DJ'ing over Memorial Day weekend....but it was stop and go, stop and go...horrible.  But if you really like choppy/bad transitions between some classic 80s rock tunes, this is your place.  Lavo's dance floor was TINY and the ceiling was really low, so this place overheated fast.  They don't offer tap water at the bar either...only Voss bottled water for $6 (think 8 oz)...RIDICULOUS.    I have no idea how this could possibly be advertised to be on par with Tao.  The crowd had a very high male ratio as well (gee I wonder why).  Definitely will not be coming back for sure.",

    "text": "We had the night all planned out: Dinner and drinks at Tao, then we get into Tao nightclub without having to wait in line and pay cover.  It was brilliant, and all thanks to other Yelpers who noted that this was their policy.  Only trouble is: Tao nightclub isn't open on Wednesday, and we didn't find that out until after dinner when we asked our server.  He mentioned that Lavo, their sister restaurant/nightclub, would let us in for free.   Ok, cool, mission accomplished.  Maybe tomorrow we can dine at Lavo, then get into Tao nightclub.  Hope it works the other way around . . . .  Not really impressed by Lavo, partially because of the bottle-service phenomenon.  It was pretty small, and all the seating was taken up by bottle service tables, roped off even though there was no one there.  You try telling your girlfriend who just walked to the monorail, to Tao, and then from Tao to Lavo in heels that she can't sit down.  Not pretty.  I have to give bottle service and high heels a separate paragraph.  See above for why both of these things can make a fun night out feel like a death march.  If these two things did not coexist in Vegas everywhere, there would be a lot more happy ladies out there, perhaps with less-sexy feet and not draped around some dude who wants to show off his $, though . . .   The music was just OK.  The mashups/medleys of old school pop like MJ and other '80s and '90s hits were too short - you'd get into one song and they'd switch it up on you real quick.  Most of the newer stuff was standard club hip hip . . . snore.  It was still fun, I can dance to almost anything with a beat, but mix it up a little.  Soaring melodies and more funky bass lines can do wonders to lighten up the droning bass.  I wish MJ's Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough lasted longer than just part of a medley . . .  we stopped, but we didn't get enough.  The crowd was cool, no real aggressive douches, or it would have been maybe 2-star or worse.  But we did see a group of them entering as we were leaving, so who knows.  The dancer they had on a platform was hot and talented, she kept things going.  The rest of the crowd was fun, friendly, out for a good time, and that, a bass line, and some good club lighting can keep me out on the dance floor despite the music.  Looking forward to trying Tao-the-nightclub tomorrow, and hope dinner at Lavo gets us into Tao like the reverse did last night.",

    "text": "Great service at 10pm (they close at 11pm). It is a beautiful restaurant, we arrived around 9:30pm and noticed how pretty it was inside so we stopped by the bar and had a drink. We noticed it was getting close to 10pm so we asked to sit at the patio. Again very pretty patio right on the Strip. We got lucky bc the weather felt perfect out there. We were served bread with marinara which is pretty unique and delicious. We ordered the lobster bisque, I was excited bc I love lobster bisque and this one has sherry in it which makes all the difference in the world. It was tasty but can't taste the sherry too much, the tarragon over powers the sherry (still tasty). We then shared the lobster Louie which is a huge portion, it was good but not our favorite. I got the seafood penne Alfredo which was delicious and Chilean sea bass also delicious! I recommend this place for a romantic date, good food, ambiance, great service.",

I told him no, it's 100 degrees outside, save those tables for your visitors from Houston.  It was 6pm and there were plenty of tables indoor - although when we finished our meals and were leaving, the restaurant was packed.  Maybe some folks enjoy the heat, not me.  We discovered that a special \"Restaurant Week\" menu was in effect - so we ordered from that.  The menu consisted of an appetizer, entree and dessert.  The food was all excellent.  We had calamari, caesar salad, salmon, tiramisu and bread pudding.  Price was $50 pp and portions were a good size.  A bottle of beer was $10.  Water was free.   The service was extremely attentive - waitress, drink servers, food servers, managers - all showed us a lot of attention and made sure all our needs were met.  Of course, the only time I didn't see our waitress was when we were ready to pay the bill.  Had to wait awhile to get the check.  Noise level was fine and it was easy to carry on a conversation - which leads me to really my only complaint.  The tables for two consist of one long padded bench along a wall with individual tables and a chair facing the wall for each couple.  These tables were spaced so close together that absolutely no privacy existed.  My wife and I kept our conversation light while we learned all about the lives of the two couples adjacent to us.  My suggestion is to request a four top as we noticed many couples were seated at them.  This would afford a much better overall experience.",

We did family style, so we got to try a little bit of everything. Our other favorites were the meatball appetizer and the seafood fettuccine. The carbonara was a little too salty, but overall everyone loved the food. We also split a pitcher of their pomegranate cocktail drink between 9 of us and it was refreshing.

Their Caesar salad was nothing short of spectacular.  A Caesar salad, right?  Their croutons were home made, and made to perfection.  Lights scripted with a touch of sea salt--just incredible.   Their pizza was insane.  The crust was perfect, soft with a light crisp. The toppings picked from premium meats and vegetable and cooked to perfect.  Fantastic coffee, and their 20 layer (yes, I said 20 layer) peanut butter cake was like nothing I've ever tasted.  Simply put, just perfect.    The service was second to none.  The waiters were always there just when you needed them, and they knew and understood the menu inside out.  They were polite, welcoming and friendly.    Plenty of seating indoors with a cool ambiance, and awesome terrace overlooking the trip which was very cool.  Fabulous experience and highly recommend.   Terrific spot.",

    "text": "I was here for the first time for dinner 2017 for my sisters bachelorette weekend and I was surprised how good it was. It might be a little $$$ considering it's a bit small in portion size but it tasted good. I had the carbonara and it was delish. I believe the meatball was the show stopper here and it was huge. But its just a lil weird for me to eat just a huge meatball for dinner. The fried oreo dessert was really good as well. So in a sense they have a slight \"fair\" like offerings here.  The ambience is nice although our table was in a weird location....it felt like it was between the bar and the actual restaurant.  Everyone passes through our table. So you may want to be more specific if you want to make a reso.    Parking is ALWAYS FREE at the Venetian and Palazzo.",

    "text": "Best Italian food I have every had on my 5 trips to Vegas.   Loved this place and I so wish we had gone on first night instead of last night in Vegas as we would have gone again during our stay.   We made reservations and were seated within 5 mins of arriving for our scheduled time on a very packed Saturday night.  We got a drink while waiting and the men said they were impressed the prices were reasonable ($6.50 for dark rum and coke)   The place has a great atmosphere and it was so cool, hip and interesting details. The DJ spinning tunes set a great vibe.   When we ordered we realized as food arrived that we should have done more 'family style\" as we noticed other tables were doing. Portions were HUGE. I was surprised as I thought this would be the expensive \"chic\" restaurant with high prices and small portions.   Three of us shared a calamari dish ($16) which was so Delicious- tasty, not greasy, and rings only (no tentacles) and it came with a yummy marinara sauce.  Someone else in our party had sea scallops and declared them one of the best ever.  We all order pasta- carbinara, penne all vodka and seafood linguine. All were again super big portions and so amazing. All of us licked our lips but had no chance to clean our plates with all that food.   Next time we said would order pizza (looked amazing), calamari, caesar salad and pasta and maybe meat and all share. They bring everyone dinner size plates so sharing made easy.   Bill was reasonable for what we expected of this high end place and worthwhile in every respect. I think it even gets you free entrance into Lavo nightclub but we already had free entrance into club so can't confirm this for sure.   One thing that would be my only comment for improvement would be to get some bread with dinner.",

They have one small dance floor with a go go dancer in the middle.  She was hot but there was no room to dance around.  On the side they have tables and a bar in the middle.  People are crowded around their table so you can't make your way to the bar.  They also have one main hallway between the two areas and it backs up.  But they always have people telling you to move, but you have no where to go.  I will make sure not to come back.  Their bar downstairs was nice and a lot more relaxed.  Actually had interesting conversation with some beautiful women down there.",

    "text": "This review will definitely be in 2 parts since I have now eaten at the restaurant and been to the nightclub. So, lets start off with the restaruant. I think the food here is very very good. I think its even better than Tao. The chef here has done a good job of creating a menu that, while small, offers some interesting and intriguing options. Both times that I have dined here, I had some very tasty dishes. My favorite so far has been the sliders (which were very good), the Ludo's Crudos (a selection of fresh raw fish) and finally the Lamb Shank Quesadilla (which is superb). They may be small dishes, tapas style, but they are very filling and good. The decor of the restaurant is Turkish bathhouse like, but dark and intimate feeling. The music is ultra cool and very sexy downstairs in the restaurant and sets the mood accordingly. Absolutely one of my new favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Ok...now lets talk about the nightclub. First thing you notice...its tiny. I definitely look at it like more of an ultra lounge type of place, but its a nighclub so you have to take it as such. The bartenders are very cool. I have met a couple of them and they really were very friendly and accomodating. The dancefloor area isnt the biggest so its very crowded with its packed in this joint. They have a couple of nice VIP couches surrounding the dance floor for premium viewing. There is also a bigger VIP elevated area in the back of the club with alot more area. The sound system in LAVO is incredible. Very clear quality and thou loud it doesnt sound overbearing at all. And of course...the crowd. I must say that the couple of times that I have been to this place, the crowd has been pretty good. Saw some good looking ladies in deed. NOTE: Had a definitely Nathan Hearns experience here. And for people that know me, its so to a tee. LOL. Only I could be given a big \"F@#$ You\" by Alan Thicke (yep...the dad of Robin & yes \"Mr. Seaver\" from \"Growing Pains\") in the bathroom for having on a piece of my clothing line that says \"F@#$ You Hollywood\" on it.

I made these reservations through Lavo's website via OpenTable and confirmed with a credit card.  We arrived promptly at 8pm and were told our table was not ready.  After waiting 30 minutes, our CEO asked the young ladies why we could not be seated and they both just shrugged.  Fifteen minutes later we still had no answers as to why we had been waiting 45 minutes for a table booked almost a month prior. The hostesses were completely unconcerned. I'm sure Lavo has the same food it did last time, however the incompetence level of the staff and manager are inexcusable.  Only make a reservation here if you are interested in scrambling to find another dinner spot when they cannot accommodate you.  If they cannot learn to hold a table reservation, then they need to stop taking reservations.",

    "text": "Prior to waiting to go upstairs to the club, we ordered some drinks and got some appetizers at the restaurant/lounge area downstairs of LAVO. This place is located right across from the front desk. We come in and it has that dark loungey feel to it with some Goa type trance music going on. The service was pretty good with a sultry waitress serving us drinks and appetizers. We had a bit of a mix-up because we moved over to another table and the waitress brought our food over to the couple who were sitting across from us at our old table. The couple unknowingly took a bite of our food and we all had a good laugh about it. They were quick to bring us out a new plate of pita chips and dip. The restroom downstairs has the worst sinks in existence. Aesthetically pleasing but lacking in functionality. The water comes from the ceiling and into this giant deep basin. Looks cool but you got to stomp on a pedal to get the water to come down and when it does it splashes all over the place and onto your clothes. The bathroom guy went on a little rant about it. haha. Overall, the lounge/restaurant is not bad.  As for the club, I didn't spend too much time in it actually. It was probably a grand total of 5 minutes. We got in, ordered some drinks and got out because we had to head on over to Moon. On the second trip to LAVO that night, it was in and out yet again.  I'll update this review in the future for the club.",

I have never visited the club, but I have managed to sit in the lounge a few times.  The DJ plays mostly deep house, and the decor is warm and inviting.  Since it has so much to offer, it's a good place to start your evening, stop by for good food and drink after shopping, or chill out and chat with a mix of friends.

We told him to keep looking, which he finally did (with an attitude). He saw the name and then said, \"With a large group like that you would need 2 tables, which will cost 5k.\" Are you kidding me?? 5k for a crap place like this!

    "text": "** Club Review** We went to Lavo as a joke because my friends had free admission and line passes. We are not \"club\" people, but figured it would be a good way to see Palazzo and see what Lavo was all about. I called ahead to see if cameras were allowed. I was told they were, but got some resistance as we were coming into the club. (I did get the camera in). I guess they were afraid we would snap a paparazzi pic of some random celeb there and call Tmz.. I only wanted to take pics of myself and my friends on vacation. We were ushered upstairs to the club where we paid $13 per drink. There is really nowhere to sit as all the tables/seats are reserved for crazy people who are willing to pay three, four or five times as much for bottles of liquor then they would at the local liquor store. Now I like Grey goose as much as the next person, but for $375 a bottle, the goose can suck it. Lol. There was also $6,000 (yes that was six thousand dollar) bottle of Cognac. Who's drinking that??? P diddy?? Insane. You can sit at the reserved tables until someone more important (or more stupid willing to get hosed paying for alcohol) comes in to sit there. Standing room only ensues as the night goes on, and as you know, standing in one place on your feet in Vegas, for hours, is never a good thing. The dance floor is teeny and tight, and they were playing music from the early 90's. Mary J remixes, old 50 cent, crazy old stuff. I thought in Vegas in a cutting edge, trendy club, the dj would be more on it with some recent tunes. The drinks were good, but not for the price. All in all it was a funny experience watching all these young rich kids trying to out buy their friends with liqour on their tables to impress the girls. Comical. All around you saw sausage fests- 5 or 6 guys sitting alone around a table full of expensive alcohol.  I would rather been dressed down in jeans at a crazy fun bar, or dueling pianos, or at toby keiths on a good night.",

Not a bad deal at all.  But the place was PACKED.  I might sound like an old coot when I say this, but I HATE overly full clubs.  It's so unnecessary.  There was NO seating unless you paid for that seat.   Also unnecessary, the two chicks strategically placed at the top of the stairs who's sole job is to writhe and wriggle on top of each other like new, reluctant lesbians.  Is this supposed to be a turn on?  Cause all I thought was \"How do you list this job on a resume?\" The highlight of the night came when Sam manuvered us to the front of the dance floor and into prime real estate.  Space to move and breathe abounded AND there was a stage to dance on!  Now you're talking!  I spent the better part of the next 90 minutes doing my own wriggling and writhing (lesbian-free) on said stage.   The music took a turn for the lame (see house music remixes) the later the night went on, so we took our leave sometime then.  All in all, a fun time.  Although I'm still trying to figure out why they bill themselves as a bathhouse (get it?  Lavo...Lavotory?  Spelling aside of course)",

    "text": "Never would I have thought to come to LAVO for dessert. I thought it was just a club.  I came here for one reason: FRIED OREOS! Sooo soft, warm and FANTASTIC! It was surprisingly light unlike the ones at Carnivals. The Vanilla Gelato that was served with them made the dessert PERFECT! I ordered it to go, but I couldn't contain myself and i tore that to-go box up and ate it at the bar <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w#t-DhxUlDTT6T8wgDmc2LMQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Vsew...</a>",

I brought the girls here for dinner for our bach party and had our meal set up as a pre fixe at reasonable fee per person which included tax and gratuity.   They sat us in the private dining room, and immediately they brought out delicious plate after delicious plate of varying items from calamari, to giant meatballs, to pasta, salmon, etc. Everyone was able to sample a variety of things and no one left hungry. They even had dessert prepared for us as well, deep fried oreos and a chocolate cake.   Great times to be had at Lavo. Make sure you add this to your list of vegas stops.",

    "text": "This is review is purely for the nightclub/patio for drinks as I've only dined here once, years ago, and was underwhelmed. Nightclub alone would get 3* it is super small, crowded and hot in an unpleasant way. It is pretty though and on the several occasions I was there, it was to support worthy organizations. Just too small for my comfort in a nightclub setting.   Couple weeks back, joined a lifelong friend and his wife at a different venue in the Venetian and it was too loud to chat and sip. Remembering the patio overlooking the Strip, we walked over to the Palazzo and enjoyed drinks, a warm night and the \"wow\" factor visitors enjoy al fresco on the Blvd. We just wanted to chat and catch up, which we did, waitress was very friendly, kept the waters coming and even suggested a new Stoli \"Elite\" vodka: same price as Belvedere and reportedly more filtered. It was very smooth and I truly enjoyed it with my soda/lime \"clean\" go to adult beverage choice.   Last call was relatively early, but I'd definitely take friends here again for a good pour, smiling helpful service and reasonable (15$ - ish) drinks. As we were leaving a couple of promoters grabbed us and walked us into The Act nightclub...and down the rabbit hole we went (another, crazy review!!)   For now? Solid recommend as an early evening spot for drinks in a lovely environment. Before it is Africa hot :)) 3.5* rounded up to 4* for view.   Yelp 100 Challenge",

    "text": "**NIGHTCLUB REVIEW ONLY**  THE GOOD: -We stayed at the Venetian so we got free passes to LAVO, which also put us right in the front of line and we did NOT have to wait! This was amazing considering it was Memorial Day weekend and there was a bunch of people in line waiting to get in.  - As you walk into the club, you are encased in a glass walkway where you can see people dining downstairs.  - It was a glow in the dark theme, which I didn't know when coming in so I was pleasantly surprised.  They were also handing out glow in the dark glasses.  - The bartender was also amazing! We kept coming back for drinks and in our 3rd round, we said we wanted something fruity so he surprised us with his own mixture - it was UH-MAZING!  My sister can drink with the best of them so she rarely gets a buzz, but she was having an amazing time dancing and drinking it up thanks to our bartender.  (**TIP: Be nice to your bartender here! They are friendly and will be equally generous with their concoctions).  - The music was also awesome!  We were at Pure Nightclub the night before and we all couldn't get into the groove of the music because the song selection was just that bad.  LAVO restored our faith in good music and Vegas clubs again and we had a great time!  THE BAD: - The only thing I have an issue with is the small venue of LAVO.  Don't expect to be able to move around this club by the time it hits midnight. Thank goodness we arrived at 11pm and had at least a good hour to enjoy the music & drinks before we just couldn't stand the crowd anymore.  OVERALL: A great club experience! - we got in, we got drinks, we danced to awesome music, and then we got out! - all within 1 hour - my are we efficient club-goers :)",

Ordered an additional garlic bread and unfortunately it never showed up  The lemon ricotta waffles plating is beautiful, although I felt it lacked flavor and I tasted no lemon. Also had the steak and eggs  I felt the steak was a bit over cooked and needed more seasoning. I love coffee but I don't like it luke warm. I like it hot and two sips in it was already cold. Overall the presentation and customer service are very pleasant. Our server Josue was very attentive and always topped off our drinks, his customer service was excellent. Thanks",

    "text": "This food...DAMN GOOD!! The beet salad was beyond good as were the asparagus. We had a party of 30 for my Aunt's bday celebration and it was about a six course meal and everything I ate was perfectly cooked, the seasoning were carefully thought out and executed to perfection. The chicken marsala was thinly done and small, but packed an incredible taste of the mushrooms underneath and sauce drizzled on top. Asparagus spears were seasoned with salt, garlic and lemon and sauteed the best I've ever had.  The service was by far the best we had all weekend. I believe our server was Danny a young guy with tattoos on his arm. He was awesome. I sat at the table with my cousins and their kids (it was a younger table but well behaved kids) and he was helped serve the little ones so we could enjoy our meals, who does that? NO ONE EVER!! at least not the places I've been to. He was always right there filling our cups up as was the other server, I can't recall his name. I just remember he has a lil girl who was around the same age as my baby cousin and he was showing her pic to them, which we didn't mind and thought it was really cool how intimate they made the whole experience feel for us.   We stayed at the Palazzo and I was not too impressed by the service, but the restaurant and service made up for a lot of it! I would recommend anyone visiting Vegas to try this place out and hopefully you get our servers and experience what we did.   The entire party got the following: Kobe beef meatballs (two large ones) in marinara sauce, beet salad with vinagrette dressing (perfection) sauteed asparagus spears in lemon and garlic (awesome) calamari (tied for the best I've had) not greasy at all. Italian sausage with pasta and Bolognese Sauce (a bit salty, but creamy and very good) Chicken Parm (too greasy so I didn't touch it) didn't look that appetizing. Chicken Marsala (already spoke about) and Pasta Carbonara with bacon (this was on point!) Creamy, great taste with every bite, perfectly seasoned and great portions. Then we had chocolate cake with peanut butter filling with was too sweet for me but the filling was not your average skippy peanut butter. It was slick, creamy and perfectly sweet. Oh yea and the infamous fried oreo. I didn't eat this but everyone said how good it was.",

The inside is trendy, soft lights, romantic, and very comfy. When we were taken to our table, it took a bit long for our waitress to finally come greet us. Throughout our meal she was just OK, she seemed to be in a rush every time she came to our table. Not sure if she was swamped but when you are paying good money I do expect better service.   We ordered a few cocktails and a bottle of wine. I chose a Super Tuscan at a reasonable price, when the bus boy brought over these awful little by the glass thick short stemware. Um yeah if I order a b bottle of wine please give me decent stems. After I politely asked him for nicer glasses he did bring over much nicer stems. Of course my sister and brother in law thought I was being a wine snob. It's all good, they have no clue. ha ha   We started with some appetizers, mussels, and an eggplant dish all were very good.  The eggplant was awesome!  Then entrees, we all ordered different dishes, their menu is fairly large with many options to please everyone. The presentation was nice, good size portions, cooked fresh. All of our entrees were good, nothing to great. I was not to wild about their marinara sauce. It was sweet and too thick.   My sister and brother in law loved their food, and was very happy we chose this restaurant. Food could have been much better as it was forgettable for me. And service well they need some improvement. The view outside was gorgeous, it is a very pretty restaurant, we did enjoy our evening but next time I am so wanting to try \"Tao\".   Prices were high, for Italian food that was just average at best.",

The time I came here was when I was staying at The Palazzo and it is located just inside the hotel / casino... which made coming here a no brainer. Although this is a somewhat smaller club, I love the bouncers and promoters here. They are friendly and handle the crowds well.   My first time coming to Lavo was a great experience. As we walked in, you are greeted by the hosts and also an interesting stairway where you can see up over the crowd. The club is just super sexy and has a very young vibe. There is a dress code, there are hot club dancers, and I think we also saw Lil Jon?!   There are few bars to get drinks at, there are plenty of areas to dance and there are two bathrooms where you can do your business. I also like that there is a balcony that you can go outside to get a breather, escape creeps, or grab a smoke if needed. Overall, the music is fun, people are up and dancing, and the staff here is respectful and helpful. The place is beautifully decorated, and just screams Vegas. Although it is a smaller club, it is still a really good time here. My friend and I had such a great time here, we came back twice in one week. Lavo is awesome!",

    "text": "This restaurant has a super sexy vibe, and awesome food and service.   We ran about 30 minutes late to our Saturday night reservation and I called to let the hostess know.  I was happy to see that the restaurant was right inside the front entrance to Palazzo so we didn't have to battle the crowds of the casino on a holiday weekend. When we arrived, I apologized profusely but the hostess told me not to worry and gave me no shade whatsoever, seating us right away. This set the tone as all the waitstaff was friendly and seemed to be having a good time.  The vibe is awesome.  The design of the space is beautiful and feels really sophisticated.  It doesn't feel tacky or over-designed like other Vegas restaurants. The generous candlelight was lovely and romantic (otherwise the restaurant is very dark).  There was a DJ playing a really perfect blend house music and pop that was exactly right for right before going out.  If you don't like loud music or are in a group, I'd probably stick to a quieter venue.     Our server, Sal, was one of the best I have ever experienced!  I'm used to good service but he was great. He gave us the right amount of time to look over the menu and to relax between courses.  Somehow he had that perfect balance of engagement and charm but wasn't too intrusive.  He enthusiastically recommended his favorite dishes and anticipated all of our questions and needs.  His recommendations were right on and our food was fabulous.   We got the tuna tataki, the black cod, the special truffle risotto, sauteed spinach and brussels sprouts.  While everything was above average for, the black cod was so perfectly prepared and flavorful.  All this and a drink, and we got out of there under $100 per person, not left hungry at all.  I feel like when going to Vegas it makes sense to try different spots all the time, but I have to say I'll be back to Lavo for sure on my next visit!  It's so hard to find this authentic ambiance, expert staff and delicious food anywhere else on the strip!",

With that said, this review is completely for the food! The girls and I came for a set comped dinner (so please do excuse me if I name something horribly wrong) at about 9:00PM at night.  We waited FOREVER. Like, seriously, I was really wondering what in the world we did to them to deserve this type of wait. They were nice enough to comp us two drinks to help us offset the wait, which helped, but we were still hungry like hippos.  Finally, all the food came, all at once (Maybe they realized that 10 extremely hungry girls were going to lick the plate clean if they did it 1 by 1).  There were (drumroll): A salad, standard fare. We'll munch on our greens but I want some food! Chicken Parmesan. A little bit dry, but the sauce was good with the right amount of cheese. Pizza on flatbread. Probably my least favorite of everything, it simply didn't wow. Thinly sliced deep fried zucchini. It felt super light, I felt like I was eating delicious air. Calorie-wise though, probably a little on the heavy side. Deep fried calamari. Quite possibly one of the best calamari I have had when it comes to deep frying. Still crispy and light. Salmon on a cucumber salad. Finally, not dry and overcooked salmon. It taste fresh and surprisingly buttery.  There might have been more things along the way, but I can't think of everything. We left feeling full and way too sassy to go to the nightclub but did so anyways.  I definitely don't think it's the best food I have ever had, but it was comped and therefore made it 1-star better.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Long winded. Hmmmmm, Lavo was not bad. When I was in Vegas last year, our delightful cocktail waitress at Spearmint Rhino said that Lavo on Tuesday Industry night was a good scene. I sent an e-mail to the address on the website, asking to be put on the \"guest list\". Got an e-mail back saying that we were on the guest list, $10 for her, $20 for me. Now, honestly, I don't know how the whole VIP/guest list thing in Vegas works, the VIP guys and bouncers looked awfully busy with their clipboards. I told them we were on the guest list. They pointed us to a short line, next to an empty line, next to a line going out the door. The group in front of us (mostly dudes) was taken out of line and set aside (purgatory?). A good looking couple came up, said something to the VIP guy and was ushered in. A group of 5 attractive girls, all dressed in their tightest designer best came up thinking they were going to get right in but was placed in line behind us. We came to the front of the line, our names were on the list and in we went. No money was collected. The bar was cool, though my girlfriend's Grey Goose dirty was her least favorite of the trip. There were clearly a handful of obvious \"tourist\" types just checking the scene. After a few drinks, we went upstairs to the actual club, which was packed and definitely happening. We stayed and danced for a bit, then our age got to us (well, my age) and we left. She pulled out her flip flops and I put her on my arm and carried her Louboutins back to Encore, where we had a drink and cigar. I am sure that weekends are run a bit differently, but my time spent in Vegas last year, 2 guys, 2 girls (no one of any particular importance) and a few phone calls made ensured that we had a good time and got in to a few high end clubs on busy nights without waiting in ridiculous lines. Dress the part I guess and leave the sausage fest at home?",

(which was comped, because they forgot to bring it out, yay!) also awesome. -fries with their ketchup sorbet (cold ketchup)..weird..never had that before. -margherita pizza...which had potatoes...lobster! and caramelized onions. so different.   we didn't end up going to the club upstairs afterwards, but it looked pretty busy and cool.  like last time.. loved the super modern decor and random decorations..  i want to be there every time i'm in vegas.",

RESTAURANT went here friday night w/ girlfriends for a bachelorette.  - service was friendly and attentive, although a little scattered at times.  - decor is beautiful, it's really really pretty inside. i would loooveeee to be brought here on a date. (hint, hint.) HOWEVER. the bathrooms?? what the hell is up with the water falling from the ceiling in the bathroom sinks? i got DRENCHED. water splashed all over my face. maybe im just not talented enough to use their fancy shmancy sinks :( - we ordered a pitcher of some blueberry stoli drink. don't remember the exact name. for 9 girls, it came to $8/pp. we each got a little glass of delicious but completely weak drink. i do NOT recommend you purchase this. although tasty, a total waste of money. perhaps you could ask them to make it extra strong?  - four of us went splitsies on three dishes: the beef kabobs (yummy and there was a kabob for each of us, so well-portioned), the greek salad (lots of fresh veggies, really tasty but the olives were bitter, and definitely worth $15 because it was huge), the greek dipping platter (the pita chips were sooo yummy and the hummus & tahini were perfectly made)  if this restaurant were in LA, i would go back all the time just to eat. really a yummy menu. i only wish we hadn't gone at 11pm, that is WAY too late to eat dinner. :(  CLUB: seriously, why do owners think that they can take such a small space and call it a club? the place was CRAMMED with people, not because it was so great, but because the space was ridiculous. the dance floor was just a giant mass of people. ugh. and the bouncers were SO RUDE. pushing and shoving girls?? not cool at all. from what i remember, there was no bathroom line, which means there must have been ample stalls, but i dont remember it being particularly pretty. which is strange, because the rest of the club, although crappy for other reasons, was well-decorated. & as for drinks, they were made pretty weakly and $13 for a raspberry kamikaze (times 10 for 10 girls) is not okay if you dont listen to me, make regular kamikazes, and then get mad at me when i point out that you screwed up. heifer.   basically, lavo is just a smidge larger than bank and just as shitty. save your time/money - go to XS or tryst.",

They weren't snotty or anything and we didn't have to pay a cover charge.  We walked in around 11pm on a Thursday night and it was really empty.  We left for a while, came back around 12:30am and there were a lot more people.  Unfortunately, not too many people were dancing.  I think it had a lot to do with the music selection since there were a few songs where people would run out and dance to, then go back to their drinks after it was over.  I suppose I could blame the dead dance floor on the DJ.  I really liked the small intimate dance floor.  The whole place had a nice vibe to it, but it was just so dead we wound up leaving in less than an hour.  They were playing better music downstairs in the restaurant area!",

It's a small venue (upstairs area), which made it even sadder that it was so empty looking :( We bounced after finishing off our AMFs, but I wouldn't mind giving it another shot the next time I'm in sin city, just to see if it's picked up.",

We waited outside of the restaurant on the lower level outside, they had velvet ropes designated to \"Palazzo Hotel Guests (free), General Admission, and VIP.\"  Luckily we got there early enough (10:45) and we got in just fine.  Right as you enter you walk up a large flight of stairs and through a hallway with running sinks on both sides of  you, then another flight of stairs which leads to the actual nightclub.  As you enter, the full bar is directly in front of you with VIP tables surrounding it, and to the right is the dance floor, and more VIP tables.  The ambiance of LAVO was amazing.  Nice and dark, and the DJ (DJ Vice) is the best Vegas has to offer especially on Sunday Nights! Drinks are cliche Vegas Nightclub prices ($10 per shot/beer, $15 per mixed drink), which wasn't a problem because they were all pretty strong.  Overall excellent experience, and although the Nightclub is quite small, it has one of the best DJs in Vegas and an affluent clientele.",

I had the most expensive spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had.  It was really really good but I don't feel it was worth $32.00!  The pizza's we ordered were great!  Our waiter suggested the meatball pizza (which is what the chef's make for the staff) and it was good but the \"white\" cheese pizza was absolutely incredible.

We called in advance to discuss bottle service options and were told there were three options available (3 bottle minimum upstairs, 2 bottle minimum at the lounge and 1 bottle minimum on the terrace).  Our VIP host (Rob G.) assured us that all three areas would be packed and there would be virtually no difference in the amount of people at each level.  We decided to go with the terrace because there was only three in our party and one more would be more than enough to drink.  We arrived at the club around 10:30 PM and were taken to our table on the terrace.  When we arrived we walked through the lounge area and noticed it was packed (we could also see a lot of people in the upstairs portion of the club).  When we were shown our table on the Terrace there was NO ONE out there.  We quickly asked if we could upgrade our table to one inside and pay for the second bottle.  We were told that wouldn't be a problem and that our VIP host would be out within five minutes to get us.  We didn't get moved inside until 1:30 AM and had to suffer through sitting on the terrace where no one else had bottle service, our hostess didn't bother to come pour our drinks and the only people who bothered to come out on the terrace were there to smoke a cigarette.  We never did see our VIP host Rob G. and only got moved inside when we complained to the club manager about the poor customer service (this was after sending Rob G. 20+ text messages and talking to two other VIP hosts (Rob C. and Jordan).  The customer service here certainly needs an upgrade.  p.s. - If I could give this place 0 stars I certainly would",

Their signature dish (chilean sea bass) came out cold and had to be cut with a knife and fork. Because it is a hotspot, expect a lot of \"hen parties\" on the weekends...which means a lot of \"Woo-ing\", cameras going off and girls taking shots. I've been there, done that and understand the fun. But didn't expect it to be going on around me in such a \"classy\" place. Also, reservations were for 9:30, didn't get seated until after 10:00. Again, if it's a hotspot I don't expect to be seated immediately, but over 30 minutes is excessive.",

Don't get me wrong very nice intimate club, loved the set-up and at first the music was barable, old skool rap, mixed in with some other random stuff but that didn't last long, it went right into your usualy hip-hop, top 40, cheezy music.  it was god awful.  If you like that music your in heaven, if you don't your in hell.    Stay in the lounge area and just chill.  Good music barely exsists in Vegas.",

The line to get in was nothing like that at Tao only a 5 minute walk away and I would put money on Lavo being just as good of a time as Tao (I wouldn't know how long the wait was though as my uncle is a VIP...I don't ask why). The first floor bar was swarmed with single businessmen and women in their mid-30s. The bartenders were friendly, always offered service, and SUPER cute. The second floor houses the dance floor and DJ area, which I only peaked into as I was not in the dancing mood (as my gin and tonics were starting to hit me and the blackjack tables started to call my name). It seemed like a good time, everyone was dressed well which is something I admire about Vegas - the nightlife scene really values looking good. I like that.",

Mind you, we had just finished dinner and only had a glass of wine at dinner and this was the first club we had stopped at for the night.  We tried to tell the bouncer this story, but he kept threatening us to leave and that none of us are getting in.  The bouncer was rude and very inappropriate!!  So the bachelorette was fed up and ripped her ticket up and threw it at the guy and we all left.  Don't waste your time and money.  This place has horrible customer service!  I've heard similar stories about Lavo, even going to the point of not letting in people of certain race.  This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen!!  Lavo will be shut down soon...",

    "text": "Yum!  My first real meal in Vegas was at Lavo for dinner. Four of us went and were seated quickly (I forget if someone had made a reservation) but it was relatively empty (7pm on a Wednesday night) so not too surprising.  My companion ordered the kobe beef carpaccio as an appetizer for the table, not knowing that carpaccio is raw meat (he was just lured by the word 'kobe' because he loves it). Anyway, when that dish came out, the meat was HOT PINK. I love carpaccio but it seemed unnaturally radioactively pink. It came with a little arugula salad that was nicely dressed and a crisp parmesan cheese wafer that was yummy. The beef was okay, but not the type of carpaccio I'm used to. There were way too many parmesan cheese shavings on the meat itself and too much salt and pepper for my taste.  For my main dish, I got risotto with braised short ribs. The risotto was creamy and delicious and the short ribs were tender and flavorful. My companion ordered steak, which was really good, but nothing outstanding about it. The other couple ordered the rigatoni with sausage and bolognese sauce and chicken marsala. I got to try the chicken marsala and it was really good; flavor was nice and not too overwhelming or salty. However, the portion size for the chicken seemed rather small, but then again, I'm a greedy pig.  For drinks, I asked for a bellini and the waiter said that they had something called the lavollini (or something using the name of the restaurant) so I got that. There wasn't anything different about it, except the name, because it tasted like a standard bellini.  And just to mention, the waiter we had was in training or something, so he had some tiny girl following him around all night, watching his every move.  Overall, a pleasant experience, but nothing bedazzling about it at all.",

    "text": "I ate here for dinner last Friday when I was in Sin City and I was impressed with it all. It's conveniently located right by the taxi drop-off inside the Palazzo, so we didn't have to walk aimlessly through the hotel looking for it.    Our party of five had to wait fifteen minutes for our table.  For a Friday night, that wasn't too bad of a wait especially when we arrived around 8:30.  We enjoyed a cocktail at the bar until our pager started to buzz.  We got seated at a round table in the middle of all the action.  There were at least two bachelorette parties nearby feasting on their dinner before they really got their party on. Lots of cute girls for the fellas.  Service was great from the get go from our server.  I did notice the entire staff was either hot-cute or metro-cute...I guess that's a job requirement when applying at this hot spot.  Yay for the eye candy!  It's a fancy restaurant.  Dishes are on the pricey side, so if you're game to splurge on a nice dinner, go to Lavo.  I started off with a bowl of lobster bisque ($14 bucks).  It tasted fantastic and I was starting to get full before my main entree of salmon came out (I think it was $23).  We're also served complimentary garlic bread and that was delicious!  While we waited for our entrees to come out,  I was studying the wine menu (which had a great selection for this wine drinker).  I think I had to lift my lower jaw off the table when I read that a bottle of French wine was priced at $9,000.  If I were a baller with P. Diddy money, then maybe I'd order this.  In the meantime, I enjoyed my Effen Black Cherry vodka cocktail thank you.  It didn't take too long for our food to come out and when it did, I was impressed with the presentation of my salmon.  I'll share pics of what I grubbed on.  I felt bad only eating half of my meal, that lobster bisque really filled me up.  Dessert was equally tasty.  The group shared bread pudding with vanilla gelato and cheesecake with ricotta topping...I was stuffed but how can I not sample some of this when it's in front of my face.  It was a nice way to end our meal.  Lavo turns into a lounge after dinner and the upstairs is where the club/dancing is at.  If you eat here for dinner, a manager walks around all the tables and stamps your left wrist so you get rock-star, velvet rope-opening entrance into the club.  You have to exit the dining area and re-enter on the side where the club entrance is.  It's probably five steps away, but once you flash your stamp, you're golden and in the club in a hot minute.  That was a big plus considering there were at least 50 people in line waiting to get in.  There were some girls on the dance floor not behaving themselves that night, so a brawl between two petite girls and a hefty amazon chick with a pink boa around her neck were clobbering each other on the dance floor for a while before security finally broke it up.  That along with the two Kim Kardashian-looking dancers on the side of the bar kept me and my friends entertained for the short time we were upstairs.  It was way too crowded for this grown woman and my stiletto heels were mad at my feet by the end of the night.  Would I go back?  Sure, if I were in my mid-20's and down for the club scene.  I'm glad I went, but you'll find me downstairs lounging on a sofa sipping on a martini enjoying the people watching all over the place.  One note to the girls:  walking around barefoot after your dogs are barking is kinda icky.  I saw at least twenty girls doing that this particular evening as the night was coming to a close.  My feet were hurtin' too, but I sucked it up and kept my shoes on.  I don't know, I just had to mention it...lol!  If you're in Vegas and want to check out a cool, metro restaurant, lounge and club, then check out Lavo and enjoy what it has to offer!",

    "text": "Did not see any single person walking around passing out passes to go to Lavo. Walked in to grab the free admission pass during lunch time, called in the afternoon to be put on the guestlist without any promoter's name, and showed up at night and got in less than 3 minute wait thru guestlist line.  There is 1 particular free adimssion Pass that also gives you a free drink ticket. You have to look for it though..because there's like 4 different version of free admission passes and there's only ONE that gives u a free drink. Lavo was very generous with their comp drink rule - there was none! You could have anything they had on hand. Most other places have that stupid rule that only well drinks apply to comp drinks =P So take advantage of it with your pass...  The club itself was a lot smaller than I thought, but I still liked the feel. Pretty chill, nice bar, the nicest bartenders - (yes...much friendlier than the ones at Blush in the Wynn who were snobs and even nicer than XS bartenders) who won't hesitate to help you out with drink options.  The dance floor IS quite small..but it works.  And finally, they have the most awesome bathroom ever..I absolutely LOVED it..it reminded me of some enchanted castle restroom or something, with their lion-head sinks..haha  All in all, XS is better..but Lavo is a great alternative to the others (better than Pure, the Bank, etc)",

    "text": "No one ever talks about Lavo much. Right now, it's all about Marquee and Surrender. Lavo is definitely not a new club, but it's worth going to for one night in Vegas. We had no problems getting in. In fact, I was there for a bachelorette party and only half of us made it to the guest line by 12 AM, which was suppose to be the cut off before guest list line is void. We happened to meet up with the girls that made it to the line exactly as they were at the front of the line a little after 12 AM, and the bouncers led us right into the club. Not sure if that was pure luck or if they're really accommodating to guest listed group of girls. I'm guessing it was the first one.  They have free drink tickets for girls if you sign up for their e-mail list. Somehow one of our girls got a hold of a ton of tickets, which I think the girl just gave us all of the extra--since they're only good for one night. The lady said it was good for things like wine, beer, and Patron shots. But I asked the bartender which mixed drinks I can get with the ticket, and he suggested Sex on the Beach, which I thought was such a great deal--free? Those are usually at least $12.   I must admit I can't recall the vibe entirely because it was all a little hazy, but the club wasn't typical Vegas-packed. Likely that was because Lavo isn't one of the newer hottest clubs like I mentioned before. But, I actually think it's better that it's a little less known. The DJ played some of the best top 40 music and never repeated once. We stayed til the end, and had a great time. The best part was that it was in Palazzo, which was walk-able from the Venetian Hotel--where we stayed.   Give Lavo a try!",

The sea bass was standard size and was also very good. Like I said, everything was outstanding, I would just ask the waiter how big the meal is, because you may want to split it.

There were more freakin bouncers than customers at the damn place.   AND you can smoke inside the club, which sucks for everyone else b/c my friend and I all got burnt at least once that night we were there. the drinks were ok priced: $7 for red bull vodka, cheaper than hollywood. There were alot of stupid drunks around the club, and they were old and unattractive. One of them bitches stepped on my friends foot and she was bleeding for a good 30min. Horrible!

Compliments of the Chef: frozen shot of Bloody Mary.  Eh.  Not a fan of the liquid version either.  Bathrooms sink basins were pretty cool.  Remember to step on the pedals to induce the flow of water and keep your hands DEEP inside the basin, or you're going to be a sopping mess.    The venue is BEAUTIFUL and I can really see spending a nice evening lounging, snacking, dancing and maybe even hookahing.    Check out the salads, Ludo's Crudo, the filet mignon and the desserts.  Flavor of the filet was delish.  The crudo was fresh and I even liked the sliced olives on top.  Check out the tea selection-I went with the Earl Gray with Vanilla Bean.  So fragrant and delicious.  I could sniff the fumes all day.    The portions are on the smaller side, even the entrees, so you may need to order 2-3 plates per person in your party.    One of the loveliest venues on the Strip.",

The lobster bisque was inedible, the chopped Louie salad was 90% onions, 9% mixed greens and 1% lobster and shrimp and the sea bass was so so. Reasonably priced for Vegas but definitely not somewhere I would recommend. I'm not sure if it was the alcohol I consumed that night or the food at Lavo (probably the food) but it did not sit well and violently came back up the way it went down the next morning.

I was not impressed at all the first time I was there and have only grudgingly gone back for friends birthdays/bachelorette parties.  I'm a local and I just cant understand the hype about Lavo.  The decoration is cool and its a very sexy vibe but for as much as you expect from their reputation, Lavo is TINY!!!! There's really only one square cut out for a dance floor and the stairs that lead up to it are always wet.  I don't personally think there should be stairs leading on and off a dance floor anyway.  Nevermind the few flights you have to walk up and down to get in and out of the club from the restaurant as is. The music was average. Not really much variety. Just all house music.  And it's so crowded in such a tiny space I've been burned by smokers' cigarettes on more than one occasion.  I'm not even a smoker.  Like I said, I understand the Vegas nightlife and I've seen smaller clubs than Lavo but for how many people rave about this place I think it's way over-hyped.",

The grapefruit sized Kobe meatball was one of the most sinful treats I have ever tasted.    Lavo's dishes win because of their simplicity and elegance.  Nothing is too fancy or over the top, it's just classic Italian food amplified with high quality ingredients in a gorgeous setting.  The dining room has sky high ceilings, massive chandeliers, low lighting, and is staffed with very attractive servers.  I couldn't have asked for a better Vegas dining experience, and I only tried three things on the menu!",

It was the place to be and be seen Saturday. Me? I came for the food. Completely unimpressed.   Lemon-Ricotta Waffles- They had a very sour taste that could have come from the cheese/yogurt or the lemons. It certainly was off and everyone at the table agreed.   Pancakes with a Fruit Compote- The consistency of the flapjack was light, fluffy, yet tasteless. The fruit was dull and lacked sweetness.   Brick oven Margherita Pizza- This was the saving grace. 2 feet long and packed with warmth from the herbs and lightly sauced and cheesed. We devoured it.   Crispy Garlic Fries- It was the perfect fry. The only item besides the pizza we enjoyed.   It's too loud to eat let alone have a conversation. The energy and crowd was that of a Vegas nightclub at 2am. Girls in short dresses dancing on tables and guys in sunglasses and chucks standing against the walls. FYI- ladies watch your purse. In fact, bring a clutch. While I was taking a picture we had two bottles of Voss and sunglasses taken from our table. Ugh.   It's for the young party rockers! That's what they are going for and it works. DJ Vice let us have it with his sick beats! I'm not gonna lie. I spent half the time dancing and all of the time spinning out on Sugar Free Red Bulls and Belvedere. A good time was had, but will I be back for the brunch party? HELL NO.

It was about 11:30pm on a Friday and although the back of the house was probably pissed off at having to cook 5 medium rare stakes, prepare a huge seafood sampler and multiple appetizers right before closing, they did grrreat. I had a tasty, cooked-to-perfection medium rare bad boy with grilled asparagus.   The chef sent over a COMPLIMENTARY 3-tier holder full of 9 double-patron shots. ;) Can you say pre-party? I think yes. Especially after our 3 or 4 shots of vodka prior and our hotel being within walking distance.    We were all on a great buzz when it came time to head upstairs to the club portion of Lavo. The club was veryyy packed. The music was great for a little two-step but it was just so crowded that you couldn't do much else. The fact that we all left soaking wet because of the bubbles and foam was a little interesting. I guess it helped us not be too hot, but it definitely left things sticky. There is not much area to lounge, but there is a pretty wide-open space by the bar that generally stays pretty open. You'll most likely be able to grab a seat there.   Overall... we were looking for a fun place to be and this place gave us just that!",

Yes, weevils- microscopic bugs that burrow through wood, pantries, food, fruit, etc. We spotted several crawling around in the fruit and burrowing through the blueberries. WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THEY GOT INTO. None of us could finish our food after that... Yet, we were still charged!!!! The manager apologized and tried to compensate by giving us free shots that were basically syrup and tasted like cough medicine. The eggs I ordered to be cooked through arrived yolky, runny, and way over easy. I had two bites and especially after finding the bug, did not touch any of the rest of my meal. WE ALL ATE THE FRUIT but only the fruit plate and one person's dish was taken off our group's bill. The manager seemed more concerned about \"being embarrassed\" and making the restaurant and chef look bad. This place does not live up to its reviews and NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED/SHUT DOWN.",

The sangria was made with frozen fruit not fresh and worst of all I asked for no bacon in my pasta for kosher reasons and the waiter put my plate down and stated no bacon as to which it was covered in bacon and couldn't eat it!  My husband went to the manager to complain so he comped the pasta but the manager did not once come to the table to apologize ! Disgusting food and poor management and won't be returning !",

Maybe it's better earlier on a different night?  Pros:   None really other then we got in for free with only a 15 minute wait. I heard that if you dine here you automatically get into the club with no cover or  wait.  I think I would still pass though.",

They have a salad here call the Louie Salad which is a mix of seafood (lobster and shrimp) served over greens and vinaigrette topping. One of the best salads I have ever had. Drinks are served in slightly smaller glasses here, but don't let that fool you... way more alcohol than anticipated, and that creeped up on us after about an hour. Sneeeeeaky bartender!",

This go around we had a late reservation of 9pm, and some how they got behind and weren't able to seat us.  Luckily, we were having fun at the bar enjoying their fantastic cocktails.  I would normally have been extremely annoyed, but they took ownership of our mistake and comped a round of drinks at the bar, a round of drinks at our table, and our first starter.  Excellent customer service!  Our food was delicious as always.  Chicken Parm and Margherita pizza  were both spot on.  We'll definitely be back.",

Littered with celebrity chefs named facilities, there are more names dropped here than at the end of a movie. Italian dishes are the affair, one which there is no need to cheat on, because it's good fare.  Sure some celebrity chef named Ralph Scamardella builds a menu that is tasty, but you don't come here just for the food.   You come here for the incredible atmosphere, you come here because the servers in the bar side are basically supermodels, and you come here to have a great time.",

After our waiter gave us our water it took him awhile to come back to ask if we wanted something else. After he came back, we ordered our drinks & dinner then he asked us if we wanted the bread. He was not friendly and for a pricy dinner, did not have us feel special. Then during our waiting, my husband overheard our waiter speak to another gentleman (another employee) in a tone which was not respectful. Once the runner gave us our food. It took awhile, again, for him to ask how it was. We said \"okay\". Then he walked away and did not see him again. My glass of wine was empty as well. Our food was bland and I gave 2 stars only for the patio and the bread & sauce. I ordered the Shrimp Risotto and husband Seafood Alfredo.     I just wanted to leave at the end of dinner because it was all such a disappointment. I am sure he sensed this and still did not show any cares of our business or money! We unfortunately did not get his name but he does look like the singer, Macklemore. I would not go back to this restaurant and would not recommend. So many other great restaurants in LV.",

    "text": "First the review of the restaurant:   I would actually have given the restaurant 4 stars, but since this is a combined review of the restaurant & club, and the club I will give zero stars, that averages out to a 2.     The food was delicious.  No complaints about that.  The garlic bread to begin with was great.  Their caprese salad had great fresh mozzarella which I love.  I have to say their flat bread pizza was just ok, nothing special, but it's the cheapest thing on the menu and definitely filling.  We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was good, but kinda expensive ($70/pitcher).  Overall everything about LAVO the restaurant was nice including the decor, the service & the food.  Now the review of the club:   Worst club I've ever seen in Vegas!  We went here for free after eating at the LAVO restaurant.  It was about 11:30pm when we got into the club.  YUCK!!!  First of all it was TINY!!  Seriously, the smallest club I've EVER seen.  And then it was SUPER packed with really gross people I might add.  It was almost impossible to dance on the dance floor and we didn't even try getting a drink.  The bar was insane.  We spent 5 minutes here and then I couldn't stand it anymore!  Awful place, I hope you will avoid it after reading my review.  Go to XS or Marquee!!!!  After leaving LAVO (this was on a Sunday night), we asked one of the female employees at the exit where she would suggest going, and she said XS.",

I went to Lavo on a Tuesday night several months ago. I was told I was on the guestlist, and when I told one of the bouncers, he put me in a line with everyone else. Turns out that they just put general admission and guest list people in the same line. Then the guy with the clip board told me I was not on the list.  I ended up paying to get in. I was frustrated at everything (I'm a local) but I kept my cool because I was on date.  The drinks were expensive (bad place to bring a date) but the music was good. The dance floor was busy but it was possible to dance, unlike other night clubs. Then again, it was a Tuesday. On Friday and Saturday, I could see this place getting way to crowded, as this is a very tiny night club.",

The dance floor is on the smaller side and the place doesn't have a high ceiling to emphasis the extravagance like other LV clubs but it does the job.  There are a bunch of VIP areas that border the dance floor so expect big bouncer men to keep pushing you back.  During this night, our group of guys and girls went to Tao for free and the guys paid $30 for Lavo.  Not worth it.",

It's small but the when you think about it, the dance floor is about the same size as all the mega clubs in Vegas it just less going up the stair, roof, and etc....  Just one dance floor with Top 40's music from Hip Hop, Pop, and EDM (Good music if you ask me)  Not crowded which is a plus because you can actually dance without bumping into someone.  Plus drinks were cheaper like $12-$15 dollars compared to other that charge $20  Come here if you want to have fun and avoid the crowds!",

I am pretty sure they had it cooked in advance, which probably explains why the pasta was little dried out instead of fresh.    Club: zero stars.  This club is tiny.  They don't actually have tables.  If you pay $350 for bottle service, then you get four seats on a couch with a very small nightstand on the floor in front of you.  If you don't \"buy\" a seat, forget sitting at the bar.  It only has room for the first 5 people to arrive.  The only place we visited with worse service and attitude was Marquee.  There are other clubs far superior.  The night I was there, the crowd did not impress, either.  Boys sitting on one side of the room, girls on the other, very little chemistry.",

It was a nice night so we chose to sit outside. Ended up being a good call because it offers a pretty cool view of the strip. We even got to catch some fireworks from the pirate show over at Treasure Island.  Anyway - our waitress was great. She recommended a bottle of Pinot Noir which turned out to be very good wine. We had heard that the meatballs were their specialty, so we ordered 3 of them for the table. Wow, just like everyone else has said, it was incredible, and the 7 of us housed them in about 2 minutes. For my entree I had the Chicken Marsala, which I enjoyed but it was nothing to write home about (kind of a standard dish I suppose, though). For dessert we shared the fried oreos. Didn't see much talk of these in the reviews, but oh my god you have to order those as well.   Overall a really enjoyable experience and I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

We stood in line for like 3 minutes- NO COVER. and when we got in, they put these yellow wrist bans on us and told us open bar till 11:30 :-)  The DJ was GREAT!!!! Most Vegas clubs are Techo and Dance or House music... but this one played Hip Hop, Rap, Oldies, Salsa, Reggae and Reggaeton-- All without speeding up the beat and making it sound like House music.  So if you need a break from the average Vegas DJ- this is a great spot where you can do the stanky leg, dougie, walk it out, do the beyonce bounce, get your suavemente salsa on, groove to some Prince and drop it like its hot to some snoop dog. and much much more! lol  The crowd was mixed.. mostly 21-30. And the night I went ( January 1,2011) everyone was being really friendly and was attractive looking. I remember randomly making friends with these random girls. lol. And the guys were very sexy, respectful, nicely dressed and could dance!  The DJ had us falling in love. lol  The atmosphere has an upscale appearance. what you would expect from the Palazzo. Had a cool entrance with these \"sinks\"lol and a classy restaurant downstairs.They had go-go dancers and these two girls sitting on top of the bar in \"roman\" costumes \"looking sexy\" lol. they just sat there and tickled  each other with feathers (BEST JOB ON EARTH-- can i get an application?) lol  There were places to sit for those who chose not to splurge on the bottle service.  So if you get tired of dancing just grab a seat by the bar, or on the stage, or on a random go-go dancer platform. lol  I met this SEXY Puerto Rican guy and he was my dance partner for the night, so i may be bias. lol. but overall this club was GREAT!  If you are in Vegas to dance the night away and have a blast LAVO is the place for you! If you dont like hip hop or you cant dance, then go to Ghostbar or PURE . lol (also good clubs)",

They give you a complimentary coffee cake, and I'm upset that it was only one and so small. It was delicious.   I ordered some clams on the half shell to start and they were super fresh. The cocktail sauce was amazing too   I also got the eggs Benedict and the hollandaise stole the show.",

    "text": "Staying at the Palazzo Lago Suite and decided to make reservations at LAVO for my bf's bday. Made the reservation for 8:30pm however, we were seated at almost 9pm. As hungry as my bf and I were, we received complimentary GARLIC BREAD w/ sauce and ANTIPASTO (shaved Parmesan, olives and pickled veggies). Unfortunately I've had better tasting garlic bread and sauce. We decided to order the half dozen OYSTERS. The presentation was nice but so unfortunate that the oysters were so small in size compared to those we get in LA... by the ocean.  The main entrees included SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS and the ROASTED CHILEAN SEA BASS with a side of ASPARAGUS. Bf said his spaghetti and meatballs was too salty, but since we were both so hungry, he finished his plate and I, mine. The Chilean sea bass in my opinion was overcooked. I've had plenty of Chilean sea bass in my days and it always comes out with a silky and cuts like butter with a fork texture; normally a melt in my mouth sea bass. To my surprise, I needed to use the butter knife to cut through my palm sized piece. It came w/ some potatoes and tomatoes. I ordered the asparagus hoping it would have a nice snap crunch but no, it was slightly chewy/stringy.  We did not complain about the food but unfortunately this was the first and last time we will dine at LAVO in LV.  POSITIVE NOTE: The server was so sweet and brought my bf a piece of tiramisu for his birthday and we both thought by far it was thoughtful and topped everything we had ordered that night. So if you're up for dessert, order the TIRAMISU!!  2 stars is because our server was great and the staff were attentive however, this place would've received 1 star because the food was disappointing.  Hope y'all have a better experience than we did!",

Throw in about 5 cold meals and a chicken parm that tasted worse than a lean cuisine microwave meal. Don't forget some Over cooked sea bass and bad service. The server was rude and when we mentioned that we may not be totally satisfied with our meal, she brings over some young, cocky,  jerk of a manger who confronts my family in an aggressive manor telling them they are wrong to complain about a pasta sauce that was not what it was listed as in the menu! So many great places off the strip. Eat like locals, do not give your cash to those crappy places that just turn out meals and take your money. You are just a tourist right, they see you once and give you a horrible experience, what do they care they never have to see you again. Thousands more will fall victim soon after. I highly recommend we change the scene around the strip. As a restaurant in a famous town, don't give bad service and crappy food, we are a town based on tourism and dining! It is tacky because you put yourself out there like a classy upscale restaurant. I can think of a thousand places I'd rather eat in Las Vegas. Take an Uber support some real restaurants!",

Had an easy time patting at Palazzo thanks to the fact they're one of the only hotels on the strip that don't charge for parking! Made our way over to Lavo which has an impressive entrance in the massive foyer.  Our group was seated in the lounge area, which I must say was super awkward seating--oddly spaced out so difficult to mingle, and the ottoman chairs made it seem like people were poppin a squat. No girl wearing high heels or a skirt can comfortably sit there AND appear lady-like...  It wasn't too loud and the live DJ was playing good music. The waiters were chill and informative. I ended up tasting 3 of their mocktails which were so good! Got the spiced mojito, raspberry cucumber spritzer, and the rosemary mint spritzer. Each was better than the next, and each one cost ~$10.   Side note: the restroom's sink area was BEAUTIFUL.  Hopefully a sales rep brings us back here soon!",

    "text": "Came here with reservations for brunch a couple of Sundays ago before leaving Vegas after a bachelorette weekend. The food was REALLY good. We ordered a bunch of items off the menu and just ended up sharing it all since everyone sort of wanted a taste of multiple dishes. For food, we tried:  - Breakfast Mac & Cheese - absolutely delicious! We had it without the pancetta and it was still yum! The light truffle flavor was just perfect in this dish! - Make your own omelet - spinach, onion, and goat cheese - super creamy, light, fluffy, and delicious! The potatoes and simple salad served with the omelet were also great!  - Almond Crusted French Toast - definitely glad we got this to share, because it looked AMAZING but would have been too much for my actual entree. As a dessert, it was SO GOOD! - Roasted Beet Salad - so fresh and so wonderful! I love beet ANYTHING, and this was no exception! - Burrata - always one of my favorites and it was great! - Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil - light, fresh, and delicious!  We ordered mimosas and they were great. It was our last morning and after 3 days of non stop drinking, we decided not to do the bottomless option; however, they do have one and it would be awesome to do!! One girl ordered the bloody mary and it had a mini grilled cheese on top! ADORABLE (and delicious).  The only thing that was lacking was the service. The restaurant was not full by any means and we were left highly underwhelmed by the service throughout our dining experience.  Overall, amazing! I have heard great things about the Oreo dessert and with a yelp check-in, you can get a free one. However, we were all way too stuffed to get it! Next time!! :)",

    "text": "Came here for a late Sunday morning breakfast after two late nights. We didn't want enough food to do a buffet, but were looking for some classic breakfast items (eg eggs, pancakes) - and that we received! The restaurant is located across from the Concierge desk of the Palazzo and easily accessible from the outside of the casino along the strip.   The restaurant was pretty sparse when we arrived (about 12pm), so we chose a table outside on the patio. The staff were super friendly and welcoming. As the sun shifted over our table, they opened up umbrellas to give us shade as well.   Food - Good variety of breakfast options including pancakes, omelettes, pancakes (chocolate chip or fruit), crepes, Mac & cheese, etc. Portion sizes are HUGE. I had the breakfast Mac & cheese, which was *delicious* but massive - I ate I until I was stuffed, but still have half leftover. None of my friends finished their meals either (see my pictures of all 4 breakfast entrees). Before our meal, they provided the table with a basket of breakfast pastries including a croissant, cinnamon churro, blueberry muffin, and a chocolate twist. The servers kept our water glasses filled at all times, which I always appreciate at restaurants, especially when it's so hot in the desert!  Bathrooms - very clean, refreshing design. I loved their unique fixtures, which made the sink area look more like a garden than a bathroom. You almost have to explore the \"garden\" to discover the soap dispensers on the side walls, and foot pedals to run the water through shower head faucets.  Overall, my friends & I had a very positive experience here with tasty food that satisfied each of our cravings, happy staff, nice views of the strip, and reasonable prices for the portions you get. If anything, I probably left a little more stuffed than I anticipated due to the tasty food in massive portions.",

I do believe you get your $$ worth.   We decided to sit outside and yes it was like 100 degrees plus but they had us in a shaded area making the experience a whole lot better. I was not sweating while eating my food at all so that was nice.   I enjoyed the buffet and I love that there are more options to choose from off the menu that comes with the buffet. Premium meals are all at a discounted price too so id definitely suggest you check it out. Enjoy!   **upscale, slightly dark in some areas but a beautiful location.",

The Prosecco was sitting for awhile because by the time I got it, it was warm and flat in a dirty glass. When we got the eggplant Parmesan he asked if I want cheese and I said no thank you but he started putting cheese on it anyways and I had to remind him I said no thank you. One of the worst parts was he forgot to bring out our mushrooms and had them microwave and put new garnishes on it, we could see the shriveled old ones that was underneath the new one along with the container being extremely hot but the mushrooms being cold. The staff never listened to us when we want to take the mushrooms off the bill and instead put it in a box and brought it back.   Do not eat here. You will get better service at a drive thru.",

We followed the hostess to our table only to discover that it had not been cleared yet.  5 minutes later, the hostess tried to seat 5 of us at a table that would have been crowded for 4.  While I searched for another restaurant, the host and hostess ignored us, probably hoping we would go away, which we did.  Buddy V's restaurant nearby had room to seat us immediately.    Bottom line, don't go to Lavo when they're busy, they can't handle the volume.  I won't be going at all, so you can have my table.  Try Buddy V's for good Italian food and great service.",

    "text": "I dined here this evening with family and we absolutely enjoyed ourselves. Our waitress Mya (I believe) was super friendly and upbeat. After ordering our entrees, we were served with soft warm bread that also came with warm marina sauce and an assortment of olives. The marinara sauce was delish!  I ordered the Penne Seafood Pasta but substituted for penne for linguine. It was served in a light cream sauce with lobster butter. The scallops and shrimp were cooked to perfection and the sauce was nicely balanced, not too heavy. This entree is definitely a winner!  For dinner we were gifted Tiramisu and Oreo Zeppoles with vanilla ice cream. The Zeppoles were amazing!! You have to try this dessert for yourself!  Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I had the same entree which gave us uncontrollable diarrhea for the next 12 hours so I have to knock off a star for that.",

Obviously I was eating lite, or praying what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas however my waistline says differently  Anyway I would come back for either option again, especially the meatball appetizer. The place isn't a inexpensive option but hey you're in Vegas & the meatballs are really good.. not to mention the filet, cooked to perfection. The place itself is very nice on the inside, really nice decor & the wait staff did a pretty good job. Our party was pretty a big & I would have preferred a split bill to make things easier. All in all I would give this place a definite thumbs up and go back. Check them out & happy eating!!",

We arrived at about 6PM without reservations. We were seated immediately at a very nice table. Our server was very helpful and friendly. Of course we had to order the most impressive meatball as an appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. I came for that and was not disappointed. For my main course I had gnocchi with mushrooms. The gnocchi was like tiny pillows and it was flavored deliciously. I really enjoyed this meal. My husband ordered a flat bread pizza and he thoroughly enjoyed it too. We'll definitely try this place again.",

The tomato basil spaghetti was outstanding. Great flavor.  The menu has many great choices!",

The selection of Italian cured meats, cheeses, and a raw fish bar seems artfully curated which feels refreshing in a town full of thrown together (everything) buffets.

SETTING: This restaurant is located in side of The Palazzo Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas, NV. The casino is right on the strip so it is very easy to locate it. Once you enter through the main entrance, it will be right on the left side. The inside is MUCH NICER than the outside. I wish the place had glass walls to see how nice it is from outside. Place is spotless, extremely clean and extremely organized. The designs inside are beautiful and the place has a very classy and romantic atmosphere to it.   SERVICE: Amazing. The whole staff here were so good. Our server was beyond helpful with picking our food. She recommended a couple of things that turned out to be amazing here. I wish i remembered her name to post it here! She was extremely nice and checked on us multiple times. The manager himself came to make sure everything is ok on our end as well. Great service.   FOOD: I cannot even begin to describe how amazing the food was here. Unreal. The pasta was probably top 3 pasta I have had of all time. It was better than any pasta I have had in Italy! The calamari was so freshly caught and cooked. The octopus was AMAZINGLY flavorful. Food quality was definitely 5 star quality. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to taste what great food tastes like.   Average per person: $30-$60 depending how much food you order.  FIRE!  See you soon!!!",

    "text": "It pains me to give LAVO the \"average\" rating, because I used to be a big fan. In fact, my first LAVO experience was about 8 years ago when I happened upon their NYC location by chance. I was obsessively smitten with their garlic bread and marinara, and without exaggeration, I have regularly fawned over their simple table bread offering for years.   Then I move to Vegas in early 2017, find out there's a LAVO here, obsess about the garlic bread anytime Italian food is the topic, and finally went in October 2017 for a special occasion. Garlic bread was still as perfect and delightful as the first time all those years ago! We ordered a second order on top of the complimentary offering.   Well, sadly, the garlic bread is no more; in the span of a year and a half, they made the decision to switch to an average, typical, and expected at every Italian restaurant focaccia. *hysterical crying*   So this weekend's visit was just as average as their new table bread I can get just about anywhere (I personally think Macaroni Grill has better focaccia, comparable dishes, and a small fraction of the bill). The best part was THE meatball app- very tender and flavorful, but nothing was memorable, exciting, or tasty enough to return in the future (again, especially for what you get for the price). I tried the chilled lobster and Caesar salad for my entree; lobster was over cooked and rubbery, salad had good flavor but was very overdressed.   Our service experience was also pretty average. The hostess didn't speak to our table while seating us and gave the most minimal effort with a perfunctory \"your server will be right with you\" as she walked away. Our server was attentive but not very personable or engaged with her tables, especially when I was pretty shocked/devastated about the bread. If my mom wasn't with us, we would have undoubtedly left when we found out they nixed the bread. There are just too many options on the Strip (and elsewhere) to overpay for Italian food you can get pretty much anywhere.",

    "text": "I ate at the restaurant and partied at the club. Here's the scoop on both solidly 3-star establishments.   Dinner: meh. Bring a sweater.   The restaurant is pretty enough aesthetically, but FREEZING! We were dressed to impress for the club later, and literally all had hypothermia before the second course. We had to go sit outside for an hour before bracing ourselves to re-enter for the club. And the food was just so-so. The portion sizes were really all over the place. Some girls in our group ended up with 5 pounds of pasta in heavy meat sauce that could have fed all ten of us. I ordered the handmade ravioli special and received 6 dainty little sachets of ravioli in a dribble of sauce that left me wondering if there was a Jimmy John's nearby. Sure, the entrees themselves were alright. But they need to work on the portion size. The lobster bisque was impressive, the calamari was good. Our server was attentive. Our check came out to about $75 per person, pretty typical for a nicer Vegas dinner spot. All that said, I probably won't be back. Too many other options without portion and climate control issues and with lower prices.   Club: some good parts, some bad.   I was in a group of 10 girls for a bachelorette party. A promoter got us in without a line or cover and gave us a roped off table along the dance floor with a sweet platform to dance on behind it, as well as hidden cubbies for purses. AND we drank for free until 1:30am. Of all the various deals and line jumping and free booze the promoters threw at us that weekend, this was the best treatment anywhere. We were VIPs and didn't pay a cent all night except tipping the bartender and waitress. 5 stars for how we were treated.   Sadly, this is a 3-star club. The clientele was not the typical \"beautiful people\" group you see at nice Vegas clubs. Cramming all these folks into a tiny space didn't help, because I was smushed and stepped on quite a bit so perhaps I had less patience with my fellow club patrons. However, out of all ten of us, not a SINGLE GIRL talked to or danced with a SINGLE GUY the entire time we were there. There was literally no one worth leaving our little roped off area for. Once the free drinks ended, we peaced out. Too many people in too small a space, mediocre music, and sub-par clientele. Too many other clubs that do it better. No thanks.",

Don't get me wrong, this place was beautiful, but the music suckedddd and was really bored here. Drinks were expensive but thats Vegas for you. This place gets three stars only because it was pretty, i got in for free, and the bartender was pretty nice.",

As we were let in pretty quickly (no lines that night), we were escorted to the second floor of the club where the excitement was happening. Talk about getting the night started...there were two hot chicks working the stage with their lesbian love making scene. The drinks were good and the music was flowing. I had no problem with the music at all. I gave it one less star because the club was a bit small. Overall, I think this club is ultra nice and fun!",

Our server was a bit absent, but it looked like he was also quite busy, I think he was working at least 8 or 9 tables.  I'd give the restaurant portion 5 stars if the service had been better.",

    "text": "If you're looking for traditional Italian comfort food then this isn't the place. If you're into loud music and nice decor with okay food then you're looking in the right spot. A lot of the menu is seafood based and leaves little options if you're not into that. My wife had Spaghetti Carbonara which was not bad, but wasn't anything to write home to Ma and tell her I found a replacement for her Rigatoni Carbonara. I had the Cavatelli at the suggestion of the server (after discussing not having a Pesto based pasta) and it was less than impressive. I think I could have had spaghetti and meat balls and been more pleased. Both entrees were heavy on the salt, with the Cavatelli being so much that I could barely finish it. The table was uncomfortable to sit at. The base is so large that when you pull your chair up to it your legs have to sit outside the edges of the table itself. In all, it was okay, but for a $70 meal for two, I would have expected more. I guess we have been ruined by so many great menu choices from The Hill.",

Slow to get our drinks, slow to get our table.  Our waiter had no personality at all.  The food?  eh...I've had better at home.  The portions were quite large, though.  They make over their sauce that you dip your bread that comes in foil to your table.  It was nothing that I haven't tasted before.  It was middle of the road.  Not bad, but wasn't OMG.  The appetizers lacked seasoning all around.  The meatball is huge, but was just okay.  Everyone else in my group enjoyed with they got, so that was good.  I ordered the braised short ribs with risotto.  It was brought to as a pile of risotto and a few shredded pieces of short rib.  The risotto was overcooked.  Mush.  Flavorless.  No seasoning AGAIN.  The short ribs (what little bit was there) were tough.  When the waiter saw I had hardly touched it, he offered to get something else, but I was finished with them.  We didn't even go up to the club.  I was over that place.  With all of the options in Vegas, this is a forgettable place.  Wouldn't go again....",

    "text": "My previous review for this place was based on their nightclub, now i'm reviewing on their restaurant!  =D  Great atmosphere, great food, great people, and definitely great service.  At first it was a bit of a drag.  We had reservations at 10:15pm but were not seated until 10:45pm.  I was getting really hungry, but due to great company, I didn't mind the wait since I was distracted by laughter and goofiness.  Anyway, once we were seated, everything got better!  The guy who showed us to our table was a sweetheart.  He made sure we were all comfortable and when we would get up for the restroom, he would come over and fold our napkins.  When we got back, he would pull our chairs out for us to sit.  Talk about great service!  He's not even our server!!  Our server was great, she came back at all the right times to see if we needed anything.  Of course we didn't because everyone else took really good care of us.  The food runners were awesome as well!  They'll wipe crumbs off our tables and brought out food in an orderly fashion.  When they noticed we were done with a plate, they'll bring out the next!  I felt like VIPs.  Hehehe.  Anyway, onto the food!  We ordered: Garlic Bread - Good (no charge) Caesar Salad - Awesome!  One of the best I've ever had!  Salad was fresh, chunks of cheese, and perfect amount of Caesar dressing.   Crispy Fried Calamari - Good.  Not soggy, big chunks, good marinara sauce.   Crispy Zucchini - Good!  I love zucchini!  Margherita Pizza (two feet long) - Good.  Cheesy, crispy crust.   Salmon Oreganato - this and the Caesar salad was my favorite dish of the night!  The zucchini was very good with this dish.  Very tasteful!  The salmon was amazing!  The crust was very good, the salmon was very flavorful and juicy!    I would totally come back here!  Make sure you come with friends and share though because they have HUGE portions!  It's quite pricy but since each entree is so huge, it makes up for it and it'll help if you share!  Hit up the night club afterwards!  Better crowd, not too many perverted people!  =D",

    "text": "What a huge dissappointment!  We were looking for a place to have a nice dinner while sitting outside and getting some fresh air.  Although the reviews were mixed, I thought we would try it out anyway, big mistake.  The service was as bad as the food, which was overpriced and either too salty and/or overcooked.  They do know what al dente pasta is, but sauces were bland and way oversalted -- and I love salt.  The chicken marsala -- I thought it was probably what you would expect from the olive garden.  Our server, Donnie, was so phony and clearly more interested in the tables with young women.  You would have thought he was in the club rather than serving in the restaurant.  I would also like to add that the ice water served at the table was HORRIBLE tasting and we had no choice but to order the sparkling and I found myself wondering if this was intentional as I had not had anything that tasted so discusting in the several other area restaurants we had eaten in previous days.  I specifically also asked that the champagne be iced cold -- generally they put it on ice for a few minutes before and I did add that I was very particular about this -- clearly it came right out of the cooler as it was not cold but cool.  The hostesses and some other servers and staff were very friendly and had sincere smiles -- unlike Donnie.  Bottom line, there are too many better restauants nearby to choose from to have to settle for this!",

We started w/a Caprese salad.  The tomatoes were not ripe and 2 of the tomatoes had the \"core\" in it.  Kind of a bummer for $18.00, but the overall taste of the salad was great.  I had the most expensive spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had.  It was really really good but I don't feel it was worth $32.00!  The pizza's we ordered for appetizers were great!  Our waiter suggested the meatball pizza (which is what the chef's make for the staff) and it was good but the \"white\" cheese pizza was absolutely incredible.  All of the staff was great that served us.  They were on their game.   We ate about 6:00 so it wasn't loud at all.",

    "text": "This is a nice little intimate restaurant and I really enjoyed my visit here. My friends and I came here and we had way more to eat than we could handle! For appetizers we got the calamari, garlic bread dip, and caesar salad. The calamari was so yummy, lighted battered and fried, not overly greasy and soggy. Both the garlic bread and calamari came with a marinara dipping sauce which was a nice compliment to the dish. Then we ordered the crusted baked salmon, thin crust pizza, chicken marsala, and zucchini strings. The crusted baked salmon and zucchini strings were probably my favorite dishes out of everything. The salmon had a nice crunchy baked crust on the outside and was tender and juicy on the inside. Not too bland either, salmon tends to be if you don't prepare it right. I tend to like fried stuff so maybe that's why I was drawn to the zucchini strings. Little bits of zucchini lighted fried, I do wish they had a dipping sauce for it, but it was like eating little veggie fries. The chicken marsala was a bit heavier to eat. It had a lot of sauce and cheese, but the chicken wasn't too dry. The thin crust pizza was a nice addition to our meal. Just a simple cheese, marinara, and basil pizza on a nice warm crust, yum! This restaurant fits in with the Italian feel of the Palazzo. You wouldn't think it was an Italian restaurant when you first walk in with the lighted candles and fancy modern decor, you'd probably expect the checked red and white table clothes instead. Our table was right by the window so we got a great view of fireworks from the TI show across the street.  The club is also worth mentioning. The downstairs restaurant becomes a lounge at night and upstairs is a full club. The first time we were there on a Saturday night it was way too packed so it was hard to move around and dance without being bumped into. The second time we came on a Sunday night it was a better crowd. They aren't as pushy and rude like they are at Tao, probably because Tao has a younger crowd. They play good music, all of the latest and greatest and more hip hop R&B kind of stuff, I hate it when they play too many techno or trance songs! How do you dance to those? The decor of the club is very similar to Tao in the Venetian, very dim and lots of dancers.",

We had so much alcohol that I didn't really even care. The biggest problem was the lack of security which allowed for creepy guys to bump into and knock over the girls with me. We left at like 1:30 which is really early in vegas. That's how bad it was.  The little guy working the front needs to get a clue. He yells at his own staff in front of customers. I can't even begin to explain how bad this makes your club look. Everyone is pissed off and stressed out which trickles down to the customer. LAVO check your cameras on this guy.  Anyhow...go somewhere that actually takes care of their customers.  Lavo has too much of an ego for what it is. The girls always clear out and go somewhere else at 2am too.

    "text": "If you want to be completely ignored at a restuarant - this is the place for you!  Our 8 o'clock reservation was finally seated at 8:45 - which would have been understandable except for the 8 open tables when we reached the dining area.  Our waiter was briefly apologetic and attentive - while searching the room continually for a more important matter evidently.  The sad thing about the restaurant -is the food is a 4 or 4 1/2 - the kobe meatballs were fabulous - the miso seabass was amazing and the drinks were well concocted.  However - it took 2 full hours between our appetizers and entrees and my dinners guests starting making jokes about being held hostage mid dinner.  In my entire career of entertaining clients (18+ years) I've never been so horrified.  We had already spoken to management 2 times.. they were so busy being beautiful - the could have cared less.  We started making jokes of it - and did our best - but everyone was tired and cranky when we left - not my idea of a successful business dinner on any account... I would never recommend this restaurant - ever - to anyone.",

    "text": "The way through my heart is through my tummy and Lavo has managed to steal my heart and leave my tummy craving for more. We were looking for a nice place to dine and decided to come here. Dinner for two anyone? We began with the Baked Clam Oreganato, delishhh! Perfect amount of garlic and spices, and oh so extremely yummy. Next was the Penne Seafood Alfredo, had the biggest most succulent shrimp I've ever eaten I was glad that the sauce lacked that fishy, shrimpy taste some places tend to have. The penne itself was right on al dente so if you like your pasta a little on the softer side you should def be sure to request it.  The portions were big, so much so we ordered an appetizer, entree, and two sides and had no choice but to skip dessert. We aren't small people the bf and I, we can eat and needless to say we were both full and even had leftovers afterwards. As for the sides we had the baby asparagus, which seemed regular sized to me but hey I'm not complaining they were also good, and the wild mushrooms just added to the entire meal. Overall my taste buds were please throughout the entire meal course. I would definitely go back, matter of fact I tried to the following day. It was the bf's turn to pick and that I will review next. I also had a cocktail off their menu, I believe it was a Sicilian Sun. I wasn't too phased by the drink but only because it was more on the stronger side when I was craving fruity and refreshing. The service was excellent, our server was very attentive. I wish I could remember his name to actually give him credit, it might have been Alex? Idk. I also inquired about the club which takes place later in the evening on the upper part and lounge area of the restaurant and he gladly stamped us so that we'd be able to bypass the admission line/fee later. I was kind of sad I didn't get to try their meatball appetizer, but I will make sure to go back do so the next time around. I heart Lavo and if you decide to dine here, I'm sure you will too.",

From the $20/ girls $30/ boys cover to possibly the worst DJ I've ever experienced playing Ghostbusters and Mario brothers made me want to demand my money back. The crowd there was very unattractive, drunk and even angry and starting fights multiple times throughout the night. I heard management recently changed and I'm sorry to hear for the very worst. Avoid this club at all costs.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure if I should give this place two or three stars. I've been to the bar, restaurant, and club several times each and have mixed experiences.  The goods: Whenever their service sucks, they try and make up for it. The food has been good every time, if a little unvaried. The drinks have been great every time at the bar. They are unique and delicious. Some nights we enjoy the small club upstairs. The first year it was open it was really entertaining and had a little person fanning a quite large woman when you walked in, quirky stuff like that. The decor is nice throughout the venue.  The bads: Last week we had to wait 45 minutes after our reservation to be seated. Yes they gave us a free appetizer, but the whole 45 minutes they kept telling us we were next on the list so please don't do that it just frustrates people. The music at the club is hit or miss. Hit being just ok and miss being so bad that we have decided to leave. Such as the time we had to leave because the dj was playing maybe 30 seconds of each song, sending a shout out to various cities, then repeat. You can only stand the dj shouting so much.  My friend met someone who worked there and he invited us to come by the club. She declined and told him how horrible the wait was even with a reservation and the run around with the hostesses. He said come back and we will get you a table and a bottle of grey goose. We said ok. We showed up and they were kind enough to pour us a few drinks on the house but pushed us to go upstairs. We were fine to go upstairs but had to wait in line even with this supposed vip treatment. The bottom line is this place is fine but not stellar. The best experience we'd had there is when there's space at the bar and we've just ordered appetizers. Can't go wrong there!",

Being a girl definitely has its benefits: Getting into clubs for free and free drinks being important in this situation.  So we get to the club, and when we get there, the bouncer says we can't go in that night unless we are locals. Turns out he was just messing with us because the club hadn't opened yet.  It opened at 11, and we didn't have too many problems getting in since we were close to the front of the line. We walk up a flight of stairs, walk past a bunch of running sinks, and then walk up another set of stairs and end up at the club. It is definitely intimate to say the least, but it was probably less crowded because it was a Wednesday night.  Still had a blast!  One of the bartenders looked like Billy Idol, and there was a pro BMX guy there that night, so they had a bunch of give-aways.  Yes, there is a lot of roped off VIP areas, but hey, we go to a club to dance, not to sit!  The DJ was very L.A. friendly so my friend and I had a good time. I would recommend this club to friends, but probably not on the busy weekends.  Oh, BTW, both my friend and I noticed that everyone who worked there was ridiculously good-looking, just an observation.",

    "text": "This review is only for the club.  Lavo is located inside of the Palazzo which is also connected to the Venetian and the Wynn by a bridge.  It was easy to find because it was right by the main entrance.  I was kind of surprised that there wasn't a line outside, but hey, I'm not complaining.  We got in for free which was awesome, especially since some other people said that they were charging $100 per head for cover.  Anyway, you go in and walk up some stairs so you're on a landing.  Then you walk up some stairs and you're in a hallway.  Then more stairs and you're on another landing (with a woman being fanned by a little person).  Then one more flight of stairs and you're finally inside.  My first impression of the club was \"dang, this is small.\"  It's literally one bar area and one dance floor.  The bar was quick and good, although the drinks that I ordered which are normally shooters came in shot glasses.  I wouldn't have minded so much except that they were $13 each.  Wtf, seriously?? But whatever, it's Vegas.    The dance floor is surrounded by tables which you can reserve and get bottle service, but we were riding free so we just went to the dance floor.  Ok, so I understand the idea of go-go dancers, but is it really necessary to put a giant block in the middle of the dance floor for them to dance on?  It took up a bunch of space and the dancers weren't even up there for most of the night.    There were a few dancers around the sides and also some girls in white sexified toga outfits tickling each other with feathers.    The music was good at first, but then it got pretty bad.  My friend and I went downstairs to sit for a bit and when we came back up, they were playing aerosmith, that brass monkey song, etc.  Not exactly club music.  Pros: nicely decorated, good drinks, space to sit downstairs Cons: expensive drinks, lackluster music, small dance floor, stairs, stairs, stairs & stairs to get in  It was pretty and overall I would say that it's fun, but I don't think I'll be going back again unless it's free.",

The server was great in getting us settled & taking our orders, etc. And the deserts were AWESOME, best part of the meal. The bacon onion soup and my cocktail was really good too. However, I'm probably not going to go back because the service & the following were the deal breakers for me: (1) the appetizers were really over priced ($20 for 4 bites) (2) all the seafood entrees were not good (the steak was OK) (3) I had to send my salmon dish back because it was WAY over cooked, then it was served w/ desert (4) they dropped our food on the way to the table and had us wait, serving all the food at all different times (which isn't that bad in itself - accidents happen) but then didn't make it up to us or apologize - even when I specifically asked. After dinner we headed up to the club since we were there, we were on the guest list luckily, club is super small, the place was way too crowded.",

Since I went around 10:15 pm, a promoter I met that day walked us in with no wait (brownie points!). They treated us really well. There was open bar from 10:30pm to 11:30pm so we each had two drinks (free drinks are always awesome!) The club was alot smaller than I thought it would be. It's def smaller than most of the clubs that I went to this weekend. I was really confused because you walk upstairs and down a glass corridor with sinks into the club (what the heck are the sinks for??) It is really pretty decor though. We only stayed 45 minutes because we were meeting our other friends at Haze (at Aria). If you had to choose between checking out Tao or Lavo, I would definitely say Tao. It was a nice place to stop at early in the night for free drinks though and it wasn't too crowded when I went, probably due to the fact that it was still early.",

Before you even situate yourself at the empty bar (5pm), the bar tenders yell \"i'll need an id and credit card\".  An ID and credit card in order to place an order for an appetizer at the empty bar because we were told to WAIT A WHILE for someone to come and seat us in the EMPTY dining room! ?!    No such thing as a \"good evening\" or \"welcome\" - to any patron that followed us.  Trying to get the wait staff to ask the kitchen for fettucci instead of spaghetti for our carbonara dish was nearly impossible.  When ordering iced tea with our dinner (which actually turned out to be tasteless filthy-looking water), the wait staff  told us \"oh, and we charge $4 for refills of the iced tea\".  No one cared to ask if our food was prepared to our liking, no interaction what so ever.  The food was average and the dining area is cramped for space.  We will not be returning to Lavo.  We prefer the personality, value, quality and consistency of food that WYNN AND ENCORE restaurants have to offer.  Upon leaving we asked the hostess for a comment card whereby she replied \"we don't use comment cards\".  That pretty much put the nail in the coffin for them.  Yelp was the next best thing.",

What we expected!!!  We are on their patio which was a beautiful view of the strip. We started with a cocktail to unwind as we looked over the menu. We knew we were going to go heavy food wise so we choose a lighter app... The tuna tartar ( I wanted one of the giant meatballs but my girl said it would be too much, we did see them tho... She admitted it looked as if she made the right choice by the size). The tartar was amazing. Next we choose a moderate wine ($85) The Molly Dooker... Great blend. Our entrees were excellent as well. The real treat was the tiramisu... One of the best I have ever had. Our service was one of the best we had on our trip as two servers tag teamed their patio. I highly recommend for great Italian to give Lavo a try... You won't be disappointed",

It was Sunday, the line wasn't super long, and we happened to grab a VIP card that made it free for me, and super cheap for my boyfriend.  Add to it that some of the seating was available to non-bottle service people. Yay! Some of it is really far from the dancefloor, but of you go to the left side of the room you can sit and still see the action. I appreciate that.  And to our surprise, they played AMAZING music for a good hour, if not a bit longer. I wish I could remember all the songs but there was a lot of love for the glory days of the Bad Boy label. I love me some 112.  And slowly it began to change over to house. I know it's Vegas so that's pretty much what happens regardless. And I actually am fine with house if A) I'm really really drunk and B) I'm with girlfriends that are really really drunk. But I was with my boyfriend and we both love good R&B and hip hop. So once they changed it up, they lost us.  Still a decent enough spot to go back to for cheap or free on a Sunday night.",

    "text": "Seems to be a theme in Vegas lately. Food is great, service was terrible.  Briefly on the food: Started off with the Kobe beef meatball with ricotta. Spectacular. Had the rigatoni sausage bolognese and it was very good also. Nothing on the menu really stood out to me as very interesting, but it all looked great. And while we didn't make it to dessert, we saw some of the options at the tables near us and they looked spectacular.  Now on to the service: Had a reservation for 10, seated by 10:30, meh. Our server was friendly, so I'll give him that much. We ordered a bottle of wine which we then were informed they were out of. Ordered a different bottle. When served, our glasses were overfilled and our server didn't leave the cork, both of which are pet peeves. Whatever nbd.  Ordered the meatball and were told water and garlic bread would be right out. Water finally arrived when the meatball did but no garlic bread. I reminded our server about the bread and he told me \"Oh I'm sorry, it comes fresh so it takes a while.\" Well, our meatball I assume is made fresh and yet it not only has arrived but has been eaten. So I doubt the problem is that the garlic bread is custom made for us. I hate lame excuses from servers, just say you're sorry and get it.  Finally our entree arrives, served by someone else. We eat for a bit and our server comes over to check on how things are. My wife reminds him AGAIN about he garlic bread. He runs off to get it, comes back a little while later, and tells us \"He made sure to get it himself for us.\" Well, thanks so much for going out of your way like that buddy.  We finished dinner, dessert menus were dropped off. 10 minutes later he finally comes by again to check and see if we'd like dessert. Easily the longest I've ever waited to be asked if I want dessert or coffee, it seriously felt like an eternity.  Anyway, as always in Vegas, there are much better options around, and this isn't one of them.",

My friend and I were really worried that nothing was going to be happening, and we really wanted to have a good time.  We ended up getting on the list at LAVO on Tuesday night, and we had such a good time that we decided to go back on Wednesday!    The club is small, but not in a bad way.  Because there are not as many people out in Vegas on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, it was perfect to be in a small club because it still felt full.  There was plenty of room for us to dance, but not so much that we felt weird.  Both nights we met some great guys who allowed us to join them at their tables.  That meant that we didn't have to buy ourselves drinks, so I'm not sure how prices compare to some of the other clubs.    Overall, we had so much fun.  We thought things were going to be pretty dead in the middle of the week, but we learned that what they say is True: Las Vegas is the city that never sleeps!",

Almost as small as the Temple on First street (a little exaggeration there). One bar and a mini stand right outside the restrooms. If you like rubbing skins and touching people's sweat on the dance floor this is the place for you to do just that. I think my suite back at the hotel was bigger and enjoyable than LAVO.",

    "text": "ATTENTION VEGAS-TOURISTS:  A WORD ABOUT \"LAVO\" I've been to Lavo a few times - mostly because other less-experienced parties have dragged me there.  As someone that's actually partaken of their services as a guest, (as opposed to being an employee of Lavo like most of the recent reviews on this site [ahem]) let me be the one to tell you:  -- Some of the claims made by these 5-star-reviewing, Lavo Employees are at least, supernaturally inflated and at most, just patentedly False.   Lavo's kind of a sad place that appears to have spent an inordinate amount of cash on decor, architecture & efforts to reinvigorate a club/restuarant that never really took off since its inception.  It's like the stepchild of Tao which is a less-than-authentic Asian club/restaurant as well but is really popular with us members of the Asian crowd making it a destination club for tourists and, to a nauseating degree, other guys that simply like hounding Asian women.  But unfortunately, Lavo doesn't even have that going for it.  If Tao is the Dr. Evil of Night Clubs, Lavo is like Mini Me:  It's tiny and not really useful for anything.  Here's a few things to consider:  -- 15 FAKE REVIEWS:  Their staff appears to have posted an onslaught of clearly artificial 5-star reviews from 0/1 people who'd never visited Yelp before over a span of a week, (Look at the reviews between 7/8 - 7/13)  I assume because Lavo can't get any of their real patrons to post positive experiences.  -- LESS THAN 3-STARS:  They've got an average of 3-stars across 120+ reviews when you filter out the one-and-dones.  In fact, prior to their desperate & fraudulent review posts, the club was trending DOWNWARD below their historical average of 3-stars.  -- TINY:  I love how the fake reviews of this place try to spin this as a positive.  The first time I walked in to Lavo, it was on a Friday & I was reminded of the famed movie quote, \"You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.\"  As I passed the predominantly male, sweaty & oversexed crowd, I realized that part of what really turned me off was how Lavo was just 'ultra lounge' size but was trying to be a 'nightclub' big.  The bottom line is that Lavo's diminutive size means that there's really nowhere to escape the Affliction shirt-donning, Axe-bodyspray wearing, frosted tips-sporting guys with tribal arm band tattoos & tattered jeans.  There's always gonna be some liquored up dude listening in on your conversation and butting in to say, \"HeyhowYOUdoin'?\"  So have fun ladies.  -- WEAK SAUCE CUISINE:  Lavo's original menu was probably so poorly received they scrapped the whole Mediterranean theme for an Italian one. (Because we all love jumping up & down to hiphop after eating a starchy meal of pasta, right?)  They appear to have kept the kitchen intact because I've had both menus & the menu items appear interesting but the resulting food is consistently mediocre. Jesus Lavo:  How can you f'up Linquini & Clam Sauce?  Better yet, how do you not serve lasagna at an Italian restaurant?  -- GHOST TOWN:  I've been dragged to Lavo on two occasions where there was nobody & I mean NOBODY around.  Get ready for a similar experience if you go any day other than Friday or Saturday, and on those days, it's...  -- SAUSAGE CITY:  On the nights that there are actually people there, the club has a very oddly slanted ratio toward guys.  Basically, it's clear this isn't where the hooked up ladies want to be for whatever reason.  (The Palazzo's ladies must be going to a club where things are done 'right', like across the bridge at Encore's XS)  To be honest, it's mostly amateur night in the club which kind of makes sense when you consider most of the overflow from Tao, i.e. folks that have no hookup or are noobs to Vegas club scene, matriculates to Lavo.  -- TOP 40:  Hope you like MTV \"TRL-esque\" music like Lady Gaga, Flo Rida, Ne-Yo, and everything else they play ad nauseum on  Power106 in LA because they're gonna play it over and over and over again until it's burned into your cranium, repeating the same Top 40 music every 30-60 minutes.  Only one positive: The only reason they get an extra star is the decor is VERY pretty and it's clear that a lot of money's been put into it.  Whomever their designer is gets two thumbs up for having a very elegant touch and a knack for lighting.  That being said, they misfired on virtually everything else.  Music, food, crowd flow.  Their service is frankly a crapshoot:  I've had attentive, smiling waiters there, and I've had complete morons serving us, or should I say, FORGETTING ABOUT US.  Hopefully, they'll someday get their act together but as of right now, their staff clearly does not 'hum' together as one unit.  2-stars.",

    "text": "So, I get to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year, to relax and enjoy good food.  Overall, I would have to say the most mediocre dining experience I have had has been at Lavo.  To even be in the same complex as Bouchon is a travesty.   So we enter (party of 2) 10 min early for our reservation, and were greeted, given a pager, and asked to wait - no problem, good start.  Sit down in the waiting area, too a while, but ordered a drink - ok no issues there.  Buzzer goes off, I walk back to the hostess station, and say 'I have ordered drinks, but they haven't arrived yet' - the answer - 'OK, go back, and wait to settle the bill and come back when you get your drinks'.  Really?  How about sending them to the table. Seriously?  Go back and wait and do a transaction?  Fine, so we go back and wait for the drinks.  Drinks arrive, I have to do the back and forth dance settling the transaction - go get bill, deposit cash, wait for change, etc....So I go BACK to the hostess station and they say - \"Ok, it will be a minute\".  So I am standing there with a beer, and my dining partner has a full to the brim martini waiting....  The hostess now navigates us to the table.  We were PACKED in there,  like have to move the tables around so your aren't bumping into people around you.  Not only is it packed but it is EXTREMELY loud.  I mean really really loud, barely able to hear the person across from you.  I am all for hip joints that have a buzz, but some conversation would be nice.  Maybe this is the spot to take the 'professional help' out to so you don't actually have to fake a conversation?  Menu seemed nice, nothing OMG.  Ordered 1/2 doz oysters, asked varieties, told they had Kushis (my fav) and the Ricotta topped Meatball to start.  Split a pasta main (Eggplant and Buffalo Mozzarella) and have to sides of sauteed spinach and mushrooms.  The Meatball and Pasta were pretty darned good.  Not awesome, but good.  Oysters - They arrived - not Kushis but Kumomotos - didn't make a fuss, no bigs.  Eat 3 of them, go for a 4th and once it hist the mouth, instantly know it is bad, the OMG don't puke bad.  Try to gracefully spit it out.  Waiter comes, I comment to him that the oysterman should keep an eye out, I got a bad one, and usually they travel in clumps - response 'sorry'.  That was it, 'sorry'.  Not \"GEE thanks for the heads up, sorry if you would have drowned that oyster in cocktail sauce and swallowed it you would have blown chunks all over - man I am glad you didn't do that, gee what can we do to help out\" - nada, nothing.  Spinach - I love garlic.  I really love the stinking rose - BUT YOU HAVE TO COOK IT.  This was covered in raw garlic.  I mean loaded with raw garlic - basically an inedible 11 dollar side dish of spinach.  Mushrooms - They were hammered and burnt.  If you like almost dried out crunchy mushrooms with a great burnt taste, sure why not.  I mention both to the waiter, get the same \"sorry\".  At this point I must sound like an annoying D Nozzle where this post would end up on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwhitewine.com&s=3ed29e63d5de2013a32822f384710d9a950604fa2c71c352c52565ab8acbc9f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">whitewine.com</a>, but honestly I am a pretty relaxed guy and can roll with the punches.  I get yelled at by customers all day, and can appreciate that a negative experience is an outstanding opportunity to build loyalty based on how you handle the situation...  So I get the bill - nothing addressed, full price, rotten oysters, inedible spinach, and burnt mushrooms and all.  The only good news is that is was so farking noisy in the place, I couldn't even express my frustration to my dinner partner.  Did I mention the couple next to us?  Arrived as we placed our 'water' order.  He ordered soup, both had a main - his was ravioli and hers was a baseball fillet (requested medium).  They got their food when we were PAYING our bill.  Fillet - yup you guessed it, on the rare side of medium rare (I was thinking self, that looks perfect, wonder if she wants to trade for inedible spinach and burnt mushrooms).  Had to send it back.  Really - a fillet?  You cant even get a fillet order right?  I am sure Lavo is the too cool for school place to hang out and show off your black mini-dress, pay premium price for food that is wildly inconsistent.  Order drinks - sure!  Order the meatball and drinks at the bar and then do some more walking - sure!  Have a nice dinner where you can talk to your partner and actually eat a 3 course meal - not so much.    I think you get my drift",

The music is sexy and relaxing and fun, the wait staff is cheerful and efficient. The food unfortunately, was a disaster. I started with the King Crab salad with citrus vinaigrette, which admittedly may not be the best choice for an Italian restaurant in Vegas. But I love King Crab and it seemed like a classy spot so I went for it-huge mistake. I dug into my first bite expecting buttery melt-in-your-mouth crab and came up feeling like I had just consumed a bite of sponge soaked in pledge.  I was willing to chalk that one up to orderer's error, so I played it safe on my entree: the four cheese ravioli. How could you screw up cheese ravioli, right? Well, they managed. The ravioli themselves were just so small, flat, and unappetizing; they made Safeway ravioli look downright decadent. They were not generous and pillowy with ample filling; rather they were small flat with tiny amount of strange sour cheese filling. All in all, beautiful place, beautiful staff, but the food left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively. i would definitely recommend coming here for just drinks or even happy hour, but do not eat dinner here or you will be disappointed.",

There is definitely a much shorter wait here than most other clubs. I feel like the crowd here attracts less college students (I prefer the college age crowd since well, I'm in college). I feel like this club doesn't give you the same epic clubbing in vegas experience as some of the larger clubs do though. but why do I still go? Short lines, sometimes the guys will get in free/cheap and they often have open bar for girls! It's not a bad place to start out your night, if you're not feeling it you can always hop over to another club after getting some free drinks. Oh, also because this place usually plays hip hop, or all the times I've been here anyways. Usually when I go the people I'm with aren't as into edm so we opt for clubs that play more hip hop. Although I wouldn't mind the edm, we go with the group majority :I",

She then adds you to a list and gives you a pager - like other restaurants do when  you don't have a reservation.   Sure, they brought out complimentary calamari for an appetizer after we were seated, but that wasn't enough. They didn't seem to really care or apologize about the wait. At one point a manager stopped by for a quick check as we were eating dinner and we did complain about the wait. He said he would send over a round of complimentary drinks/shots,but that never happened.   The food was good, but nothing special. I do have high standards for restaurants as I live in Chicago and am spoiled by the food scene here.  Potentially all Vegas restaurants don't care about service because they have a captive audience - I don't know - but this one certainly doesn't.  The ambiance was fun - great decor, music. However, it was freeeezing with the AC. We were dressed to go out to a club after - no sweaters or shawls, but if you can, bring one. We were literally shaking throughout dinner but they said they couldn't change the temperature.",

I'm kind of done with the club scene, but found myself in Vegas for a bachelorette party. We got a table at LAVO and the service and treatment was top-notch all the way.  I was beyond impressed and i'm a tough cookie to impress.  We had 2-3 waitresses for our group of 12 girls and they took care of us all the way.  I would compare it to the service I've gotten at a St Regis Hotel.  We also had our 1st bottle comp'd.  Additionally the club itself is beautiful. Gorgeous details and interesting things to see everywhere. The crowd was great too, good looking, classy for Vegas.  (We were at Prive the night before the the low-rent crowd there was SCARY- people stealing red bull cans off our table and sticking them in their purses with no bouncers around anywhere).  Back to the LAVO review....And to top it off, I ended up losing my passport there somehow!  They found it the next day and Fed Ex'd it back to me immediately.

Our company hosted an opening night party here - so things started out right downstairs with a glass of Pinot and their meatballs. Yummm! We came upstairs and I'm not sure how many cocktails I had but we had an entire section behind the DJ to ourselves so lots of space for me to lounge out and kick up my heels after dancing for hours. I really like the little cut out shelves all over the place and especially on the dance floor for your drinks. The bathrooms are clean, the bartenders were all pretty cute - all in all fun little spot! Whoever the gentleman was that kept telling me I was \"the hottest chick ever\", thank you! Of course I don't know the prices, because I rarely pay, and if I do - we all know good food and alcohol have no price tag ;) but Absolute Vodka was compted for about 2 hrs, so I may have had 5 or 6 drinks - yep Good Times!",

They have a wide variety of selection and the food is outstanding. From the meatball to the chicken parm or the steak they are all delicious! Don't forget about the desserts. They are also super Duper delicious. Everything about this restaurant with the cocktails and drinks and food is outstanding. If you're looking for a restaurant but not trying to spend high high dollar but still get an excellent experience and food this is The place for you! Ask for Jason, he was our waiter both nights. We requested him for the next night but due to the weather we were unable to get him. They are an excellent restaurant and the best that I have ever had. Wish they had one where I live in Boca Raton!! From a guy who owns a business and is a customer service on the daily business for over 25 years this place is the place.

    "text": "Club review only:  I'd say LAVO is within my top three club experiences: -Vanity -Tao -Lavo -Jet  I went here on Tuesday night (12/21/10) with three friends. Because one of the girls works for Tao Group corporate, we didn't wait in any lines, free entry and got open bar wristbands (all the soda water I could drink haha.) Yay us!  This club is in need of a way larger dance floor, otherwise, I'd say it was five stars. When we first got in, it wasn't crowded; there were just a few groups of girls on the dance floor. The bar was a little crowded, but not by much. Fast-forward about an hour and a half later - you couldn't even move. Any inch of floorspace in the entire upstairs was packed person to person. Forget about trying to get on the dance floor, you won't be able to push your way through the walkways. Bouncers were continually telling people to move out of the walkways and exits. They really should have turned people away and sent them to Tao. It was just way over filled to the point of it being a fire-hazard. The girl in the freaking wheelchair on the dance floor... ummm... yeah, talk about issues trying to get around a packed crowd!  The music was on par with most clubs. There wasn't any hyphy but they played Chris Brown and Justin Bieber. The crowd went wild. Mmmmhmmm. Good stuff.  As a girl, I freaking loathe when a club is 90% chicks. I'm not going to Krave (the gay bar) because I want to dance with the opposite sex - guys. I want to dance with guys. I don't want to be surrounded by girls. At Lavo, this was not a problem. Girls, if you're decent looking, I'm pretty sure you'll get hit on and dance with at least 4 or 5 guys. I did. I'm sure this has something to do with the crowd being about 60/40 girl/guy ratio. Another plus is that although the guys are flirtatious and have no qualms about dancing with you without your permission, they're not the Ed Hardy or rude crowd. They're not necessarily putting high pressure on you, even if they suggest things. Most seem to have some actual manners, which is rare for club guys.   Oh, by the way, the girls' bathroom is killer. It's Moroccan themed and gorgeous. I want one in my house, even though I don't need an oval room with 10 stalls. It was gorgeous.   I'd for sure come back!",

It also came with a red dipping sauce that went well with the bread.  We ordered the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass - amazing and perfectly cooked, not too crispy on the outside and melted right in the center. It came with heirloom tomatoes and crispy portabella mushrooms. My wife ordered the Center Cut Filet - medium. Cooked well and had good flavor. We also had a side of the Thumbelina Carrots, which were enough for two - good flavor with the gorgonzola and shaved beets.  Our server did a good job and it was a great dining experience overall.",

One huge thing I cannot forget to mention is that they provide a phone charging battery pack with a variety of plug attachments.

    "text": "Great spot!  Wish we'd had room for dessert.    We had a 10 pm reservation for Lavo because we were going to a show first and didn't want to be rushed.  We actually arrived early and the staff was able to seat us a little before 10, we spent the time before that enjoying a drink in the bar.  The space is great - dark, with djs, good seating and a nice atmosphere.  The staff was very friendly and while the music in the bar was loud, as it should be, it was not too loud at the table.  I would probably have given Lavo a 4 which is, ya know, as good as it gets BUT our server, Rina, was amazing.  Besides the fact that she was simply adorable and had an awesome personality, she genuinely seemed to enjoy her job.  She made suggestions, asked lots of questions, and checked with the chef on a few things for the gluten-free friend in our group of five.  We also walked out with TWO restaurant recommendations from her for our next trip to Traverse City, MI where I go for work every May.  Three of us ordered off the menu and two got specials.  The red snapper got RAVE reviews and should probably be put on the menu based on what we heard not only from the person in our party but also Rina.  The lamb, while huge, was also amazing.  There was a great deal of tasting going on around our table :)  K and N both got the ravioli and loved it - the portion of this dish was probably the most perfect.  I went with the army surplus sized penne alla vodka with prosciuto and peas.  It was incredible (but HUGE) although I thought the peas were a little hard.  Not sure why that would be.    The wine list is fantastic and the environment is fun.  We especially loved that even though the space is dark everything is lit from the bottom giving the fresco-ish tiles an ethereal glow.  Amazing, amazing, amazing - thank you, Rina!",

    "text": "After our dinner at Lavo, I had to \"Lavo\" (bathe) my mouth with water...  My friends and I party in Vegas about 3 times a year and we always stay at the Palazzo. Despite getting VIP comp tickets and open bar opportunities at Lavo on Thursdays at 10:30 PM - 11:30 PM (you have to sign-up with a promoter that can normally be found at the side of the restaurant), we never had any desire to go to because it never seems to be cracking like XS, Surrender or Tao. Just saying...  On Saturday, 12/11/10 my friend and I came to Lavo at 7 PM for dinner since it was convenient and the menu looked appealing. Even though we didn't have reservations, we were promptly seated.   F O O D: *COMPLIMENTARY GARLIC BREAD w/ Marinara Sauce: YUM! Piping hot of the oven, the crust was very crisp and each halved portion was slathered with a garlic, butter and parsley mixture that melted into the every nook and cranny of the bread. The chunky marinara sauce was tangy and sweet, adding a punch of freshness to the bread.  *KOBE STUFFED RICE BALLS ($17): DELISH! The rice balls were stuffed with ground kobe, a layer of mozzarella, lightly rolled in a breadcrumb mixture, fried to a golden brown and topped with a dollop of ricotta cheese.   The exterior of the rice balls were crisp, providing a nice texture contrast to the soft rice and pliable melted cheese. If \"kobe\" wasn't mentioned in the menu, we would have mistaken the kobe for just ordinary ground beef. Nonetheless, the rice balls along with the accompanying marinara sauce was the perfect combo of flavors: salty, savory, creamy, beefy, sweet and tangy.   This is where our meal went DOWNHILL...  *RISOTTO w/ Braised Short Rib ($28): DISGUSTING! First off, the presentation of the risotto was very unappetizing; it literally looked like a plate of yack. A picture speaks a thousand words:   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VsewHMsfj1Mgsl2i_hio7w?select=2KzRQou0aYKH-ZUqhlOB6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Vsew...</a>  The risotto was a funky orangey brown color. It was mixed with potatoes, carrots and celery, and topped with chunks of short rib and fried parsnips. Although the risotto was a perfect creamy consistency with a slight bite to it, the veggies were all cooked to a mush. The short rib was overly salty, stringy and dry and the fried parsnips were stale and hard. With each bite, I felt like I was eating from a can of Dinty Moore's Beef Stew because that's exactly how the dish tasted like. Unfortunately, 4-5 bites was all I could stomach before I threw in the towel.  *8 OZ. CENTER CUT FILET ($38): OK. The filet was overcooked to a medium to medium-well (requested medium rare). Although the filet was tender, it was on the dry side and completely bland. I have a huge aversion to salt and MSG, so when I say something is under seasoned, it must be. Sadly, the lack of salt never allowed the beefy goodness to shine through the filet...what a shame.  *CREAMED SPINACH ($12): INEDIBLE! Upon receiving the creamed spinach, it looked decadent with a crust of bubbling parmesan cheese. However, it tasted nothing like it looked. WHOLE spinach leaves were used and they were so large that we couldn't even scoop up the creamed spinach with a spoon without it falling off and back into the cast iron plate. The creamed spinach was extremely salty, so much so, that after each bite (I took 3 total), I had to swoosh my mouth with water. Plus, it didn't help that it was topped with parmesan cheese which sent the saltiness level off the charts.  In short, you know the food is BAD when you're munching on the complimentary bread instead of eating your meal.  S E R V I C E: EXCELLENT! If it weren't for our awesome waitress and wait staff, Lavo would be getting 1 Star. Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and gracious. The wait staff was good about taking away our plates and making sure our water glasses were never empty.   Oddly, the food came out super fast but I wasn't complaining because we needed to go back to our room to get ready for the night. We ordered, received our food, and ate, all under an hour.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R: Absolutely STUNNING and reminiscent of the ancient Mediterranean times with rich chocolate brown furnishings and gold/cream accented decor. Tables were very close to each other so there's very little personal space and you can overhear your neighbors' conversation.   Since I never been to the club portion of Lavo, I can only account for the restaurant. However, I heard the club was inspired by Moroccan bathhouses with Turkish fountains throughout creating a very lavish and exotic ambiance. Just like its sister nightclub, Tao, you can see beautiful girls in the tubs except it's much smaller at 4,500 square feet (Tao is 10,000 square feet).  Just as a person's looks can only get them so far, the same goes for Lavo's intricate and gorgeous decor. Sorry Lavo, but you are all looks with NO substance...",

Request him he's awesome.. but I did hear some of the other servers talking and they seemed as awesome as him. He recommended some breakfast places, clubs and shows for us while we're in town. Which we were looking for through the whole experience.. someone local to recommend so Dj was perfect! We stared with the formaggi charcuterie plate which was delicious. I had a gluten free pasta dish which was the tomato and basil. It paired so well with the Malbec we had I forget the name but for 75 dollars it was a great easy drinking Malbec. The dish was a little al dente but with gluten free noddles I get it.. the more you cook gluten free the more mushy they get. So far so good so celiacs check it out!! Gluten free people come in!! It was so good. Dj was also understanding and encouraging for my eating habits which was SO nice since being a \"glutard\" is hard nowadays. My boyfriend got the seafood pasta dish which he said was amazing. We had sorbet for dessert and I had a delicious espresso martini as a night cap. Overall I cannot wait to come back to Vegas to come to this establishment. I work for very high end hotel and I expect amazing service when I go out and Lavo delivered. From start to finish we had a great experience. Highly recommend. Thank you!!",

We had to wait out front, but luckily it wasn't a long wait.  During the wait we just talked about how easy that one lady's job was just sitting on a high chair in a bikini looking pretty and we were wondering how much she got paid doing that lol  There was guest list (brunch time 2-4pm) for ladies and gents, but only the ladies get complimentary champagne. We went through my promoter and it was suggested that we book a table; he was right.  Mainly for the ladies, it's $100 per girl.  You get food and drinks.  It was hard to walk around when my friends and I were there, so I would suggest booking a table if you're willing to throw down some money and have a good time.  My friends and I came kind of late, so next time we'll come earlier.",

    "text": "Review for the Restaurant Only.  Was able to get a dinner reservation for 5 the night before without any issues.  The restaurant is super swanky - dim lights, lots of attractive young waiters running around and delicious cocktails to wet your whistle.  We got a nice corner booth right by the entry way into the kitchen.  This meant that out of nowhere some hands would appear from behind us to rearrange plates, take away finished appetizers and plop extra napkins if requested.  It was a little unnerving but we eventually got used to it.  First off, let me just say that the service is amazing.  One of the members of our party didn't like her dish and voiced it to the waiter... they ended up removing the charge for it and offered her an alternative to which she declined.  Our waiter was always friendly, patient and answered our questions.  Food wise, nothing won me over incredibly.  The complimentary garlic bread with marinara sauce is yum - crunchy and well-done without tasting burnt.  I ordered the chicken and mushroom ravioli with sage and butter sauce.  The sauce was really light... before I knew it, I had devoured my entire entree.  By all means, not because I couldn't stop eating it but because it was so light on my palette.  Everyone else at my table was not very happy with their selections.  Raviolis seemed to be a safe bet... the Eggplant Parm was not very well liked by anyone.  The pizza was good (we had spinach/artichoke) but they are huge!  Easily can share between the table.  Yelp Check-In offer:  Free strawberry shortcake - delicious!  And super huge - share with the table for sure!",

    "text": "*Disclaimer This review is based entirely on \"The Lavo Bowl\"  A Super Bowl watch party that I attended on Super Bowl XLIX Sunday Nothing contained in this review has to do with Lavo as a 'Nightclub' I've been a Sports Handicapper for 28+ years and frequent Las Vegas multiple times a year. I generally go to Lagasse's Stadium, it is the highest end VIP Sportsbook experience and they serve their purpose, it is also at the Pallazzo. Super Bowl watch parties in Vegas fall into two categories, high end , like Lagasse's and Wynn and then the rest which basically are big convention rooms with tables and huge TV screens with standard tailgate food(Hot dogs, burgers etc) I attended Lagasse's the night before for UFC 183 so a member of my group wanted to try Lavo for the Super Bowl for a 'different' scene. I'm the type that is \"if ain't broke don't fix it\" Lagasse's is the only place you should go for a high end experience to watch sports in Vegas. But I went along with the group, assuming that since Lavo is on the same property it would be a good place to watch the Super Bowl.  To start off, Lavo is a restaurant/nightclub. Compared to the way Lagasse's is set up, this is a NIGHTMARE place to try and watch a Super Bowl. First off, they had to bring in separate TV monitors to spread through the venue. The screens were decent size and HD but with all the tables and booths crammed together, it was awkward sitting and watching and was difficult to walk. During the Super Bowl the feed cut out on the TVs 3-4 times. Another strike. How these watch parties work, you have a food/beverage MINIMUM that you are responsible for. Ours at Lavo Bowl was $200 per person, for 5 people. $1000 that you have to spend or lose. 20% tax is on top of the $1000 and tip is another 20% minimum. Here's the crappy way Lavo handles it. First let me explain how Lagasse's does it. Same food/beverage minimum BUT, food is ordered and brought to you, same with drinks. At Lavo Bowl, it is a BUFFETT, that you have to stand in line for. The Buffett was set up poorly so it took 15-20 to get food and the line ran throughout the club next to all the other tables. And here is the best part. In the Buffett line, the servers serve ONE serving, like a Prison. Their excuse was \"We can't fill up your plate because we have to make sure everybody gets food.\" And here is the other kicker THEY WONT LET YOU ORDER FOOD AND HAVE IT BROUGHT TO YOUR TABLE If you wanna do that....its separate from the $200 per person.  The food was decent, wasn't as good as Lagasse's but it was close.  The flyer is also a little deceptive as well the person who booked us. They say \"Open bar\" from 2-5pm. Sounds great, $200 for Italian Buffett and Open Bar from 2-5pm then we pay for alcohol after 5pm.  NOPE The \"Open Bar\" is a separate ticket for 'Standing room' only patrons. So you have to sit in a crammed seating area, alcohol gets brought to you but food you have to go stand in line and wait 20 minutes, only get one serving then have to eat everything before you can go back and wait another 20 minutes. The last negative is the bouncers go into 'Nightclub Tough Guy mode' and kicked everybody out right after the game ended. Sorry, this is isn't a Friday night at 3am. So I gave the experience 2 stars, but honestly that is VERY generous. We went and ate afterwards cause we were still hungry. Lagasse's on Super Bowl will start at around $300 per and Stadium seating would be $500 per but I would have gladly paid $500 over the $200 at Lavo simply because  1- Food and alcohol would be BROUGHT to me 2- It wouldn't be CROWDED 3- The Super Bowl feed wouldn't cut out 3-4 times 4- I could walk to the counter and bet on the game easier Next year for Super Bowl, Lavo is a NO GO Back to Lagasse's for me You get what you pay for sometimes in life  This is one of those times  \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\"",

I've never had veal parmesan before so idk what to compare it to but I am now a fan. At least of theirs. I was jealous that I didn't order it. I had the kobe meatball with ricatta and that thing was the size of a baseball. It was seasoned very well and was very flavorful. I had it for leftovers the next couple days.   Very hip/trendy restaurant with a young people vibe although I did see some oldies there. Nothing wrong with that but it is also a nightclub upstairs so I guess that explains the typical crowd this place draws.",

Definitely get it with the ricotta and definitely order a side of garlic bread.   YUM",

I'm a NYC Model & Blogger who is VERY familiar with Lavo's reputation, it's basically a big deal. So, what better place to eat at other than Lavo in Las Vegas. Upon arrival, I was checked in under my reservation & given a beeper as there was a 15 minute wait. I didn't mind at all because the ambiance & music playing inside made me feel fight at home. I loved restaurants with dim lighting, candlelit tables & a good tune to snap your fingers to. Not so long after, we were escorted to a beautiful table on the terrace overlooking the blvd. Wow! Dreamy, right? The menu options were great as there was a little bit of everything from Pasta to American dishes, as well great beverage options. I had a glass of wine and my Wife had her usual, Corona. Our Server, DJ, was so friendly and went above and beyond with his customer service. The the night took a turn: It begin to rain! Yes! Can you believe how perfect the evening and the setting was then POOF! Rain! But, this is where Lavo became my favorite place. My Wife & I made our way inside & stood on the side until we found our server. He then escorted us to a cozy table that was just as perfect as the one outdoors. We got our Pasta Dishes & DJ & a fresh glass of Wine (which was basically a complimentary 2nd glass because I almost finished the first). The food came in filling proportions and was delicious. I can't stress enough how good the DJ was, made me feel like finding a dance floor. Then, the Manager On Duty personally greeted us, introduced himself & thanked us for our patient with relocating inside before inviting us to TAO Nightclub afterward. WOW! Right? Talk about CUSTOMER SERVICE & Making Guests Feel Special! To top off the night, I received Dessert for my Birthday that said \"Happy Birthday\" along with 2 glasses of champagne! *drop jaws* Lavo, You are my new favorite place to eat & I'll become a regular in New York and Vegas. Thanks so much for your hospitality & if you don't eat here & experience magic, you're missing out! :) The bill wasn't too bad, either. ;)",

I was upset to hear that not only was their reservation for two tables knocked down to one, without any heads up, but the staff was extremely rude in the process. Instead of accommodating their group, who had planned this for months, they instead tried to throw \"free food\" at them to make up for the lack of seating. Their party had six mothers who did not plan on standing for 4 hours time. The \"promoters\" simply sold their 2nd reserved table to the highest bidder, then tried to extort more money to \"keep\" it. The rest of Vegas was great, but pass on this Party Brunch spot as it gives Vegas a bad name.",

We got everything we asked for, but the wait time could have been a bit better and it was almost as if our waiter ignored our table at some points. Maybe it was because we came for Valentine's Day, but continuing on we did have a nice view being on the balcony area facing the strip. Continuing on. The word on the street is that they have one of the greatest meatballs on the strip, so I made reservations and I'm sure you're looking for a review on it because you haven't tried it, but the truth is....I didn't have it. I will say this however, \"It really is the size of a softball!\" They serve it to you in its own bowl for two....if you wish. Anyways, I decided to try something else that night. My taste buds were set on something else that night. I started off with some spicy lobster bisque. Creamy, with lobster meat, topped of with soft, fresh cheese and lots of lobster flav For my entree I feasted upon their Ravioli Napoletana. Fresh made ravioli stuffed with Romano cheese topped off with basil and marinara sauce. It sounds simple, but when it comes to a pasta dish like that it's the sauce that makes it and I must say that it was delicious! For dessert I chose the one and only tiramisu. I've never tried tiramisu before, but let me tell you! If tiramisu is made the way Lavo does it, \"I'D DIE FOR IT!\". You just have to try it. Words cannot explain.",

(we had a little private wager at the table as the other guest said that This Restaurant must be serving Wild).  The waitress looked at me with a blank stare and said she had no idea, but would check.  It was Farm raised.. I won!!  The Tuna Tartar appetizer was really good and our main entrees were good.

The only thing I can criticize at LAVO is ordering the Chicken Parmigiana it is sort of tastes like rubber as its hard to cut and is very tough to eat.

    "text": "What to say of this experience...I came here to celebrate my birthday with 12 people to arrive at a table for 10. Their solution? Stick two chairs on the end of an already crowded table! Then you have the waitress who doesn't provide anyone at the table with a menu, when I question food options she informs me she'll be ordering for our table. Ummm excuse me, I'm sorry can I please see food options as we would like to pick what we eat..... The waitress stands there at our table as we talk over options. Two minutes pass and the waitress is asking if she can put our order in stating \"people often order too much food so she would make some selections of favorites for your table\"  Another waitress approaches asking what bottle we would like while quickly following with stating a magnum bottle would be appropriate for the table. Needless to say Im disappointed about not feeling like we were allowed the time and opportunity to make our own selections. After thought because I didn't want to make a fuss in front of a group and ruin the day so I went with the flow. Thinking now we all could have ordered our own personal meals and appetizers for the day and been much happier as the food was pretty delicious. The food put me in a better mood and once the event really started, drinks were being passed around and it felt more comfortable. In the end our group was able to salvage the brunch despite feeling like the customer service could have been so much better for the money being spent.",

The meatballs are so delicious, as is the pasta and anything we've tried. The customer service is also amazing. We had remembered an appetizer we had years ago, and the chef recreated it, even though it wasn't on their menu anymore! That was above and beyond. The main room is the best place to sit - we've sat on the patio, but it doesn't feel very nice and it's usually not a great temperature. The atmosphere is definitely better inside, and best if you can get a table not too close to other diners. Other than that, we love the experience every time!",

    "text": "LAVO has one appeal - free booze.  Generally they have an open wells vodka bar from 11-midnight for ladies. If you sign up on the email list that some girl brings around, you get a drink ticket. The drink ticket is good for anything you'd like.  If you are able to find a host/promoter, they have drink tickets to give away as well, so charm, charm and charm!  The couple of times I've been here have been fun, even though the place is like a mini-Tao. Ridiculously crowded, it is hard to appreciate the decor...especially if you don't want to drown in a crowd of sweaty people.  The crowd generally looks like they are having a great time, even though there is hardly any room to move.  It makes you want to drink..and fast, to get to where they are.  The T-shaped stage is super fun for girls to dance on (and a place to sit down). The security guards are nice (and hot) but the bartender gives me dirty looks when I repeatedly return to him with drink tickets.  I'd recommend the place for girls to hit up as a pre-party club. Though not much there, I've always had a pleasant time.",

    "text": "I highly recommend going to Vegas during the week, any week in the winter months.  No one is there and if you're young and beautiful like me you can most likely get free passes to clubs.  It probably helps also if you're with your physical therapy friends who are 75% women.    Lavo is the new club/lounge/restaurant at the Palazzo.  For those of you who don't speak Latin.. or Spanish, lavo means to clean yourself and that's certainly what I wanted to do after paying 18 dollars for my glass of Hennessy.  You can bet I made sure that glass lasted all night.  I shouldn't complain though, that's pretty much the going rate for any cocktail in a Vegas club.    The best part about this place was the music.  The night we went there was a solid DJ playing all the hits.  Much better than the house lover at XS the night before.  This club is also popular with the older folks.  Or maybe they only come out on weekdays.  Maybe it's like senior discount day at the movies except this is a club.  I dunno.",

    "text": "This Review is for the Nightclub ONLY.  Overall, this nightclub is..just OK, haha.  I'd give it a 3-3.5 stars.  There's nothing horribly wrong with this club, but there's nothing that really stands out either, so I guess it'd be your club if you want something that's pretty stable.  This place isn't the most bumpin' club on the street, partly because it's not as big of a club and more of a lounge/restaurant.  But unlike other lounges, they actually do have a dance floor.  Getting in isn't that hard.  If you have a promoter this place is pretty easy to get in, and if guys have to pay, it shouldn't be more than $20-$30 for cover, which is pretty typical in Vegas.  The line isn't that long either.  The bouncers don't seem as strict about guys' attire, but I'm pretty sure dress shoes and button-up collared shirts would be your best bet.  Going in, it looks pretty nice.  The entire downstairs is mainly the lounge/restaurant area, and the club is actually in a separate room upstairs across a mini bridge-like thing.  When you walk in the club you can pretty much choose to go left or right.  The bar is on the left, and the dance floor and the booths are mostly to the right.   The dancefloor isn't too big, but it's decent, I guess.  The music has its ups and downs, but they do play pretty good music.  Mostly hip-hop music.  The crowd is slightly older, probably late 20s and into the mid-30s.  Everyone on the dancefloor dances and can be pretty drunk, but it's not filled with people just standing idly goggling and any go-go dancers.  Speaking of which, I don't remember any, but I might  be wrong.   At the bar, their prices are pretty Vegas-priced, maybe slightly cheaper? I don't really quite remember.  But their drinks are a hit or a miss, just like any regular club.  They're either really good or really bad, so you can't really tell what you'll get.",

I love themed parties too, so... if I can dress up as a \"sexy nerd\" I'm all in!  Janet K.... You have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to the nightclub. There is a separate entrance and stairs that lead to the nightclub, which is above the restaurant. The people hanging out near the bar are most likely people waiting for the club to open at 11pm on weekdays.  The prices are typical of any bar, club, or restaurant on the strip. And the food is very good! But if you don't like the \"Vegas Nightlife\" atmosphere you need to cab it off the strip to a local bar or restaurant where food and drinks are cheaper but you don't have the full Vegas experience!

    "text": "This review will be for both the restaurant and the nightclub, since we did both. I was in town last weekend for a stagette and this is where we went on Saturday night.   We arrived at the restaurant around 7:45p and were seated right away. We had originally made our reservation for 8:30p, but they somehow lost it and when we called to confirm, (after kind of a lot of hassle) we were told that the only time they could seat us would be 7:45p. No big deal, we were already ready to go out, so we took the earlier time and away we went. After we were seated, our waiter came over immediately to give us a rundown of the menu and he brought us probably the most delicious garlic bread I've ever had. We tore through the bread in a matter of minutes and proceeded to order the beef carpacciao, a meatball appetizer (literally, the size of a softball), rigatoni bolognese, grilled branzino, spaghetti w/more meatballs, and a seafood pasta. Everything was delicious, and I can see why they're famous for their meatballs. SO GOOD. We had a bottle of wine with the appetizers, individual glasses of wine with dinner, and two rounds of after dinner drinks. No dessert. Total bill for 4 ladies = $442.50. Not bad considering we sat there for over 3 hours eating and drinking. They even threw in a shot of tequila for the bachelorette!  After dinner (around 11p), we headed upstairs to the club/lounge. We were escorted up by our waiter and given VIP wristbands. We walked inside and were immediately greeted by some really fun 70's disco/Michael Jackson mash-ups. The bar area was packed and drinks were a bit expensive, but whatever. The decor is gorgeous, all Tuscan style and really cozy. The ladies room was uncrowded, unfussy and dimly lit, with a really nice bathroom attendant, which I appreciate when I've got wet hands and I'm trying to manage my clutch, my drink, and fumble around trying to get some hand towels. I found this place to be more like a lounge rather than a massive annoying Vegas club. We danced for a few hours then left in search of pizza.   All-in-all, a really great experience at both places and a super fun night. I will definitely go back, and I would have given 5 stars had they not screwed up our reservation.",

The music as ok... and our group had a good time. We got in free, but that was probably b/c we were staying at the Pelazzo. Down stairs is the restaurant and I think a hooka lounge. Upstairs is the club. It's smaller, so I can see how it can get packed.   I'd say give it a try. My other friends went there on Saturday night and sad it was quite crowded but they liked it too.",

    "text": "Ugh. As if i havent sung this place enough praises, here I am writing another review for it. So, second time in Vegas for 4th of july vaca. Brought a new group of girls to indulge with me and everything was just as delicious as I last left it. From the time they bring you the garlic bread and marinara, just lean back and unbuckle your belt/corsets to make room, cause everything is so effing delicious. Apparently I fell into a trance and started licking the sauce off the table with my fingers. Wow. Moving on, I had my chilean seabass with a side of mushrooms, it was perfection as usual. Others ordered a risotto, a seafood Alfredo, rave reviews on the texture and freshness for both, a marinara pizza, long classic flavorful, a lobster bisque, not my fave, they make theirs taste too gingery I find, but it does have big delish chunks of lobster. But let me bring it back because the MVP of our dinner was the calamari. Again, wow, simples done right, nice and crisp tight batter and the meaty perfectly sized hoops, again dunking into that heavenly marinara. Once again, I haven't made it as far as desert cause we're always so stuffed before entrees even come, portions are huge, plus the drinks are great, we always enjoy gummi bear shots, and sparkling selections. Ugh, just so much winning to do here. Service was kind and prompt as usual, last hear we had a really cool brunette guy who comped us some shots, this time we had a lady with a short blunt cut bob, she was very nice and cautious of bringing everything quickly for us, knowing that we had to go somewhere after, and she even comped a dish for a girl who felt the pasta in her alfredo was a little too hard, and brought out a recooked version out of courtesy. Thats good service in my book, treat your customers like you truly want them to enjoy their food and experience at all costs, and that keeps us coming back. Also, I have another Lavo location here in NY that I've dined at before to get a fix for my favorites, but its just nowhere near as delish. They cook with extra love at this Vegas location, totally worth flying out 5 hours for! Sidenote, I'm disappointed to see they closed their nightclub part. Had really good times there last year (retroactive shoutouts to the chocolate cutie who used to work there named Noah ;-) Now they just have a cocktail/hookah lounge, that was actually closed on the Sunday we went so place was pretty quiet and chill. Its all good, we had limos and bottles waiting elsewhere to turn up, this dinner was still worth all of our attention!",

We were on the guest list through a promoter so ladies got writst bands for open bar from 11 to midnight.  There was no problem getting the wrist bands for the guestlist, which is nice because sometimes you go to clubs and the people with the lists ignore you and treat you like poopoo.  Guests staying at Palazzo got in free with showing their room key.  Open bar was ok except one of my girlfriends ordered a vodka tonic, and there was zero vodka.  It was free so it wasnt such a big deal.  PROs:  I never felt hot in this club, the AC system is superb. Music is great, surprisingly very short wait if any for the bathroom CONs: This place is always crowded, jammed packed with people. You will get spilled on and you will get stepped on. The door men need to really control the number of people they let in its ridiculous, they need to cut the number of people by half. The featured DJ that weekend never showed up.   We left around 1:30 because we got tired of being smashed up against people on the dancefloor.  The whole time I'm on the dance floor I was touching a minimum of 3 people at a time because it was so crowded.  I got elbowed, spilled on and stepped on so many times, i had to laugh it became funny .  haha",

Between the chandeliers, dim lighting, and Eastern-inspired decor, this place whisks you to a place far, far away. The fact that they serve decidedly Italian-fare here is kind of a misfit. But, if the food is good (which it is!) - who cares?? Your meal starts with warm garlic bread accompanied by a warm tomato sauce (LIP SMACK!) and where it goes from there is up to you! I highly recommend getting one of the 2-foot long flat bread pizzas (we opted for the spinach and artichoke, which was FAB); the roasted beet salad (DOUBLE LIP SMACK!!); and their tuna tartar app. (TRIPLE LIP SMACK!!).   Unfortunately, their penne vodka didn't quite live up to the hype of the other dishes (the peas included with the dish were SUPER hard though the vodka sauce was lovely). And, service at Lavo gets a bit spotty once it gets busy.   One last suggestion: if you go at night, try to sit either outside (depending on the temp) or inside near the window so you can see the Treasure Island Pirate Show across the street. While the locals have been there, done that, it's def. a tourista treat.",

We ordered their kobe meatball to start, literally it was a size of a grapefruit. Was ok, not the best. I had the chilean seabass, which was divine and silky....highly recommend. And the hubby had the seafood pasta, which again was just ok. We checked out the nightclub upstairs and it was entertaining/fun.",

We had reservations .. so had to wait just a little bit before our table was ready.  The server was very kind and the service was quick.   We got the Roasted Beet Salad & Mixed Green Salad for the table - Very very yummy!! The dressing was perfect!   They gave us plain bread and some garlic bread with a tomatoey sauce - very nice  For my main dish, I ordered the Rigatoni Melenzana with no cheese.  Most of our my veggie friends ordered the same.  The server was so nice, that they had first made it forgetting to not toss the sauce with some parmesan.  So sent it back before bringing it out.  I thought that was sweet cause frankly I wouldn't have noticed.   The roasted eggplant in the dish was just out of this world.  a must get for all vegetarians!   One word of caution - their serving sizes are HUGE.  So you will have plenty saved up for lunch the next day!  That makes the dish even more worth the bucks you pay.   For Drinks, we ordered pomegranate limanada (i think it was a special that day) in a pitcher.  Apparently, it served 5 cocktails.  But it looked like a lot more and we couldn't finish it.   Dessert, the table shared Fried Oreos with Icecream.  Apparently thats what they are famous for.  Everyone said it was the most divine combo ever!  Overall, I highly recommend folks to try this place out when you head to Vegas!  The restaurant also has a club which you will get entrance to if you dine there. Added bonus! :)",

The bars, bathrooms, and floors all put you inside an ancient Greek bathhouse party.  - Great music, awesome dance floor.  One neg i can think of is the scantily dressed bartenders scavenging the dance floors looking to sell shots to lonely men in need of attention.  BOO for taking advantage.  Sure, the drinks are pricey, but you're in Vegas, and this is the place to be on those \"low key\" week nights.",

Two group of guys tried to group with us because they thought that they would be able to get into the nightclub faster.... and then issues arise.   Girls: \"Oh gaawwwwd.... (where's the girls only line?)\" Guys: *fight fight, we got here first, blah blah blah* Girls: \"Oh look! So and so is getting us in because she found us the all girls line!\" \"BYE GUYS HAVE FUN HAH!\" Guys: *got owned*  We walked in and were were directed straight to a table somewhere... by the DJs. Nice! We were kicked out of the area after awhile though because the tables were actually \"reserved\" for people who paid money for it. HAH! ok, no problem but thanks for letting us dance around your area in the meantime :D.  We walked around, got some drinks, played some guys, got some more drinks, had enough drinks, got more drinks, then some gangster looking dudes grabbed my hand and invited me to his table. I grabbed a handful of girlfriends to follow me and keep me safe (but at the same time thought it was a good thing, I'm pretty sure my girlfriends are tired of standing around and would like to sit down and enjoy some more drinks). OMG AZNpRyD3 Table.   It was so Asian... Let me tell you (those who are from San Jose). I felt like I was at Lion Plaza on Chinese/Vietnamese new year. Or at one of those Vietnamese coffee shops. HAHAHA.  Oh man, so funny. I lost them in the crowd, or they got the hint when we went to \"dance\".  Bartenders are wonderful and beautiful. The staff here are VERY nice. :) I don't mind coming here again, it's a very nice venue. I thought the music was better than XS, but just like XS they started playing trance towards the end of the night...",

But I went with a group and tried everything! The pizza! The best! Thin and made perfectly, The Ceaser Salad, also very good. Very fresh Linguine Vongole - 4/5 (but not my thing, could be yours!) Caramelized Salmon - 5/5 (It fell apart easily, and wasn't your typical fish flavor.) Herb Grilled Chicken Paillard -  5/5(I didn't think Chicken could taste so many different flavors at once) Streak Frites 100/5 It was agreed that we all eat this one slowly and savor each bite. The streat came out thin and displayed beautiful with sauce. It was tender, it was juicy, we didn't want dessert we wanted more of that! If you come here ORDER THEM!   Dessert was great, the cookies, the ice cream. The normal desserts. But the streak by far was the best.  I don't think we could have tipped the staff well enough for their display, their helpfulness and overall knowledge of the food.   The place is dim, and beautiful and a morroccon retreat. There is also and outside area that faces T.I so if you go at the right time like i did. You can see the Sirens of T.I show. But.. it's not a must!   Again i got the Pretheater pre Fix deal but! Prices were not extremely expensive which i thought it would considering this is in the Palazzo.  Please this place is defenitly five star and i'm taking everyone i know there.",

    "text": "We checked out Lavo last Thursday night and I was pleased with our food, but incredibly disappointed with the service, which is why the rating is 2 stars.   After being seated and taking our drink orders, we were quickly deserted by our waiter. We sat for several minutes before a woman came over to tell us about the specials and then she disappeared. Our waiter eventually came back and took our orders, but we were able to order our appetizers and entrees because we'd been sitting for so long.   I ordered the lavolini - prosecco, passion fruit, St. Germain - this was an excellent drink and was very refreshing.   Our group started out with orders of the crispy fried calamari, spedini ala romano and the kobe beef rice ball. We also ordered the salad special, which was a delicious mix of arugula, heirloom tomatoes and a soft Italian cheese (maybe stracchino, but I can't remember and it isn't on the menu).  The table was pleased with our starters. The spedini was delicious and salty, so be warned if you aren't a fan of salt. The calamari was delicate, and for a non-calamari fan, I thought it was good.  I ordered the spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil. The fresh tomato and basil had me sold as we'd been eating out all week. The spaghetti noodles had a nice bite to them and the fresh tomato and basil sauce was excellent. I ate quite a bit on my plate and still had enough to pack up and take back. I definitely could have split this portion with another person and still could have had plenty leftover.   Our waiter returned and took plates to pack for leftovers, but forgot about two orders our table wanted packed up to go and threw them out. He did take them off the bill, but those two guests were very disappointed that they didn't get to take their food home.   If we'd had a different waiter, this rating would definitely be higher. Not only was he slow, he had the attitude that he was something special and we should be honored to have him serve us. He also didn't take time to observe the table to see who was in charge at the table, and instead of going to that person, he automatically went to the lone man at the table.  So, go for the food and atmosphere, but hope you don't get the same server we had.",

Anyways, a couple promoters I talked to recommended Lavo for Sunday night. I was with 2 girls so we got to skip the line, get in for free, and got to drink at the promoters table. Good being a girl ain't it? Haha. Aside from the extra accommodating service, Lavo is a nice club. There's a walk way that's lined with water fountains or sinks? I forget, but that was kind of unique? Music was good. It was pretty crowded from my recollection. The layout of this place is different from other clubs, there's 2 sections of the club. One filled with tables and the other a bar area.   I would come here again, but its not on my must-go list.",

Arrived around 1030 so there was a pretty hefty line but we got to go into a shorter one (upon receiving evil looks from other clubgoers) because one of our friends knew one of the promoters!  He got all 7 of our girls in for free with open bar bracelets for the first hour we were there!  Our 6 guys got in with just a simple $10 cover -- EXCELLENT.  First of all the entire venue is beautiful ---I was even impressed by the restroom of all things!  Haha I remember walking up a pretty long flight of stairs and the walkway was cool -- open so you could see the restaurant and lined with super cool sinks with running water!  We used our free drink bracelets right away.  The bartenders were cool & got us what we needed, we just passed our free drinks to the boys.  Later in the night when my friend got me water, I kept finishing it real quick -- the awesome bartender kept refilling it without a problem.  Awesome service!    The music was pretty good.  Most of my blisters from that weekend were no doubt from dancing at Lavo!  The only issue I had was the crowd -- you had to fight your way to get from one side to the other.  At one point everyone lost each other (but we found each other on the dance floor).  We had a good time and needless to say, we will return again Lavoooooo.",

Unfortunately I can't remember everything we ordered, but hey if it was awesome I would remember. All I know is, everything was over priced for the size of the portions. Some of the items we ordered:  Cuban sliders, roasted chicken, beet salad (I think), a fig flat bread (once again, I think) and of course desert and a couple of bottles of wine. meh...

    "text": "For me Sundays are the hardest nights to decide where to go after 2 days of debauchery.  It's a dilemma really, you want to party hard cause its the last night in Sin City, but you also want to keep it low key due to the check out at 11a the next day and trip back home.  Upon recommendation from a promoter friend of my mine, we decided to go to Lavo. So we visited the Club just this past Sunday as a sort of final hurrah after a crazy weekend.  So here's a what I took from my visit:  1) Alcohol and Stairs don't mix.  Whoever decided to put sooo many stairs between the entrance to the upper level club wasn't thinking of what kind of issues drunk people would have going down those few flights of steps.  I wasn't even drunk and I slipped and fell down a flight of steps(I could only imagine how funny my tumble musta looked) what more with someone drunk off their ass.   2) The club is really small, I know its Restaurant first, then club second, but this place was really tiny.  3) DJ Vice was killin it Sun Night. Probably had the best music playlist out of all the clubs we went to over the weekend.  4) The girls got free open bar wrist bands 'til midnight.  Coupled with the complementary drink coupons I got for us guys, we pretty much drank for free all night.  Overall I found Lavo to be a great club to head to for either a night where everyone isn't trying to party to hard, or a spot to head to after a partying somewhere else.  I finally found my Sunday destination next time I'm in Vegas",

The food is amazing too, the chicken & waffles are breaded in captain crunch and served so adorable. I ordered the Lobster Benedict, it's great but my lobster was so overcooked I couldn't chew it, I'll definitely come back but I might order something different.",

I got chicken Marsala - a little on the sweet side, but still delicious. My husband got the chicken roasted with chili sauce/flakes - the chicken melted in your mouth. You will LOVE this place. I only wish we could have gone more than once.",

    "text": "This review is for the CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH. Lavo Champagne Brunch runs every Saturday during non-pool season from 2-6pm. It takes place inside the restaurant, not the nightclub. I am not sure what the cover charge is, but our promoter for Marquee was also working as a promoter for the brunch and she got us in right away with no cover and no waiting in line. So be sure to look into that option first. We arrived at 3pm and it was a little weird because people were just eating at tables and there was a dj spinning and gogo dancers. There is a minum purchase for a table with food and/or drinks, just like at the nightclubs. Once it became about 3:30 or 4, the place went full on nightclub status. The lights were turned down, the music was turned up, and everyone was dancing and waving light sticks.   Drinks: Pricey but on par with Vegas prices. Most drinks were $13, even a glass of champage.   Attire: Guys should dress dressy casual. Girls can wear anything but most girls wore short dresses that are slightly less dressy than the ones you would wear to a nightclub.   Overall, Lavo Champagne Brunch is a fun place to get daydrunk and preparty for the nightclubs.",

We were told that the server that we requested was not available...staff went so far as to pretend to not have a clue who we were talking about.  We scanned to dining room to no avail and only saw the said server after we finished our meal.  Once seated in the middle of the overcrowded dining area, our server couldn't get away from our table fast enough when we didn't choose to order wine with our meal.  Her attitude worsened when I ordered the pasta since it was one of the 'lower' priced menu items. The situation with the server turned so sour, that we actually had the manager assign us to a new server to finish out our meal. When the food arrived (in 2 trips by 2 separate servers) it was quite underwhelming considering the pretentious environment.   I don't mind paying for quality and service, but it pains me to do so when what I'm served is on par with what I can cook for myself at home.  We decided against dessert (because Sprinkles cupcakes never disappoint) but were forced (our check was withheld) to wait on a complimentary anniversary dessert.   There are plenty of other dining options to explore in Vegas, so look past this one.",

The staff was very friendly and welcoming and we got a booth in the corner which was warm and inviting!  We decided to eat family style and get a taste of everything.  We were served complimentary garlic bread served with a tomato based sauce which was tasty.  We ordered a beet salad and the beets were good but the dressing was a bit on the sour side.  Then we had the Kobe meatball cut into four and it was humongous, tasty and filling!  Good thing we split it.  Next was the salmon oregano which was a hearty portion and very moist and delish.  The ending dish was the spinach and artichoke pizza which was hardy and had tasty mushrooms but nothing spectacular compared to the salmon.  All in all a tasty dining experience.",

    "text": "Woo Hoo! I'm a fan of this place! What a great place to go if you want some good food and especially if you plan on clubbing at Tao after!! For a high end restaurant, portions are pretty big and the prices not so much. Most dishes run in the 20's but there are some that are about 40. We had 6 people in our dinner party can came here to celebrate my friends divorce. We came at 8 pm, our reservation was for 8:15 pm and we were immediately seated! Our bills was was about 260 or so and after tip it was about 315. We ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, a pizza and each of us had a drink. It was an average of about 50 each person and we were stuffed! Among the appetizers, we got the mushrooms, truffle fries and their famous meatball. For the entrees, we got fish (I forgot which one), carbonara, the kobe spaghetti, and a pizza. To me everything tasted good. I thoroughly enjoyed my carbonara... very rich, tasty, and total comfort food. The kobe meatball was tasty and melted in your mouth! I didn't try the pizza because my friend was lactose and got a pizza without the cheese... she said it wasn't too bad, not the worst but she wasn't wowed by it.   I stayed at The Venetian, so I was able to charge the meal to my room and earn points. In my room, there was also a card for a free cocktail with entree. All of us girls had the pomegranate lemonade drink. The alcohol taste wasn't strong and it was pretty good. We all finished it. I don't remember our waiters name, but he was cute and gave us excellent service, everyone was really nice and efficient. The workers here work quick and hard! They carry stuff like it's nothing! We all couldn't believe it... by 9 pm, we had all our food AND had finished eating! Now that's fast! Sometimes at restaurants, it takes like 30 minutes for food to come out! And no, we were not eating fast either, no one even checked the time till we left! I like the decor. It's very dark inside though, with water elements all around.   Upstairs, LAVO is no longer a nightclub. It is now an ultralounge. After you eat, go upstairs and check out the lounge. It's got a romantic dark vibe to it and very laid back since it's now a lounge (they still have the Saturday brunches which I believe is more club-vibe). Get your receipt from your meal and show it to the cocktail waitress upstairs in the lounge. Everyone in your party will get a FREE drink! We were able to get cocktails! So each of us got another cocktail at $14 each! That is a great deal!! So we each got to enjoy appetizers, entrees, and 2 cocktails for about $50 a person! ... but wait, the night isn't over yet!  Before leaving LAVO, get your stamp from the door people for entry into Tao. We took our time walking to Tao as I think it was barely 11 pm after hanging out in the lounge for a bit and doing some gambling. A line was already in place for Tao going to the door... my friends kinda freaked about the line and I said not to worry because I'm a pro and practically live in Vegas! LOL. We walked right up to the bouncers, showed our stamp and walked right in!! NO line... and NO paying!! We grabbed more drinks at Tao and I showed them around the club. It was still pretty early for clubbing so the place wasn't packed. I was kind of bummed the roof was closed...  For about $50, we got lots of food, drinks, and clubbing! Sounds like a cheap night out!!  Both LAVO and Tao offer table packages too. Which, originally we were going to book, but the only dinner time for LAVO was 1030 pm and I told my friend I can't fill up on drinks and down tons of liquor that soon after because I will get sick. Anyways, the packages start at $82/person... for our group of 6 it would have been about $120 each person. This includes a 3 course meal at either LAVO or Tao AND a table with bottle service at Tao. I had called and asked for more information because I was going to seriously book this package and the alcohol included is top liquor alcohol... which included Gray Goose!! I did the math and if you get the most expensive item on each of the courses for LAVO, it's already $70! If you go this route, then you will have a table and sitting room... plus your own table bodyguard at the club. That what I want to do next time and feel like I'm a baller VIP! LOL. Dinner at Tao for this package however starts at 530 pm for Fri, Sat, Sun. Dinner at LAVO for this package starts at 530 pm on Fri and Sun, Sat starts at 1030 pm. I would choose to eat at LAVO because the food there is more pricey for the same package price and plus I'm Asian, so I don't like the high end Asian eateries because the best ones are the hole in the wall places.   I will definitely be back here again, especially if I am planning on clubbing at Tao!",

Their chicken Parmesan is scrumptious thinly cut, juicy with the right amount of cheese, the pasta that comes with it is ok. Their seafood platter is outstanding. My favorite dessert is the strawberry shortcake.",

There is a full bar with loads of speciality Martina's and cocktails, Jon Bon Jovi stood next to us enjoying some beverage while a DJ played some subtle techno music. It wasn't very loud, but definitely had a cool urban feel.  We were seated at our table inside for 10 people (there is also seating on the balcony) and ordered a variety of appetizers; the seafood tower on ice, fresh muscles, clams, prawns, crab legs, delicious! Grilled eggplant, Kobe rice meatballs and bruschetta came out next, everyone commented on the nice quality.  For dinner I ordered spaghetti Fra Diavolo with grilled prawns (spicy and delectable), hubby had the ahi tuna (loved it). Everyone commented on their meals being savory and well made. We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert, probably the best I've ever had (thyme biscuits went well with the fresh strawberries and creme).  All in all the ambiance, food, service (our waiter was very attentive and friendly) was A+.",

The youngest at our table had a pepperoni pizza (the crust was crisp and doughy, PERFECT, in other words), another in our group had the four cheese pizza (also perfect), and I had the Spaghetti Carbonara... O. M. G. It was absolutely SUPERB.  We also got the battered Oreos... Holy cannoli... They were amazing.

Got to the club around 1:30 a.m. You think that's late? I don't think so. There were no lines nor promoters harrassing people. It was empty on a Saturday night.  I was with 3 other women who were rockin' hot that night. Or at least they thought so. Haha. JK, they were nightclub appropriate. Stood in line for a good 5 seconds, got ID'd and the bounce dude told us that it would be free for the ladies and $20 for me. I didn't mind paying. Got to the cashier, one cashier said that one girl was free because she was local, the other two were not and I wasn't free. Had a small argument but they just let us in all for free.  Went inside, bar was empty of people and the bartenders were just hanging around. Dance floor was NOT full at all! Again, this was a Saturday night. There was actual elbow room in the dance floor and you can actually dance!!! They played old school music from the 90s and went back and forth with today's music, they even threw in some random house music in there.  Yes, it was fun but it has changed from 2009. It's probably because all these other new nightclubs have popped up and LAVO needs to up their game. Oh well.",

I would recommend this to anyone celebrating a birthday, anniversary, engagement, etc. They have big portions of their main courses. The wine and alcohol beverages are great also. The waitresses and waiters are very up keep with keeping your drinks and water filled. They were not too terribly busy either, but this was a monday night. Try them! Im sure you will like them",

We tried a slew of share-able foods. The service was excellent at the bar and at our table. The waitresses are all hotties, which is never a bad thing.  Food reviews from best to worst:  Kobe rice balls were by far the best thing we tasted, we ordered a second plate of them they were so good.  Kobe Meatball is excellent and huge, great meat texture.  Burrata salad was a special and was done nicely, but not as great as other spots nearby (such as B&B).   Eggplant parm was decent, not enough sauce, and too heavy/oily.  Skipped Scallops and the calamari, since I'm allergic.",

The description made it sound like the Eggplant would be the highlight of the meal but with it barely present, I couldn't taste it at all.  I tried some other dishes that my friends got and none of them were impressive.  I'd prefer a place like Olive Garden than Lavo Italian Restaurant.",

Basically, it is a huge ball of meat (bigger than a baseball) that is made with kobe beef. In terms of meatballs: this is the best I have ever tried. Also had a seafood mix salad (came with huge chunks of lobster).   Then came the entrees: chicken Marsala and the sea bass. The chicken Marsala left little to be desired: came with spinach and mushrooms and very thin pieces of chicken, topped with a very light rendition of the sauce. The sea bass was also very, very delicious. The skin was fried perfectly: it stayed together on the plate and just melted in my mouth. Comes with a small side argula salad which was pair very well with the fish.  This is definitely on the pricier side. Also, take note: this place can be a bit loud (we sat inside) but I'd definitely be coming back to have the Meatball again. Perhaps I'll try the balcony next time which faces T.I. and their pirate/syren show.  Tip: if you stop here, you would do yourself a disservice if you did not try their MEATBALL!",

The pitcher has tons of ice & then each cup was full of ice.  Talk about a rip off!",

So the ambiance was nice but it was not a good place for a romantic dinner.  I received an email from Opentable the following day suggesting that I didn't honor my reservation. Apperantly Lavo is having some trouble at the enterance of the Restaurant and reservations. They might consider to hire more experienced hosts/hostesses.  We tried the day club next day with the complimentary tickets we were given at the restaurant but it was like a nightmare. The young guy at the door was disrespectful and unprofessional, so we skipped the club.  Overall, they need to work on some of the staff.",

I prepared myself for potential over hype, but they lived up to all expectations.  Going a step back, we arrived on time for our 8pm reservation and had to wait as the place was super busy with it being the last night of CES. A slight nudge and the management did what every restaurant should do, they bought us a round of drinks. Just as we were going to sweet talk our way into a 2nd round, our table was ready.  This place is sexy, though due to CES the male:female ratio was skewed to sausage. It is at this point that my boss taught me a life lesson. Rather than deal with the back and forth after asking 'What does everyone feel like eating?', simply tell your server to pick their favourites for you. Now this is assuming the server isn't useless.   As I forget the sequence of arrival, here we go:  Green salad - helped with carb guilt Calamari - perfectly cooked, well spiced A-5 Kobe meatball with fresh whipped ricotta - What transpired in my mouth was a little intimate. Wow^2. Rigatoni Melanzana - It had a generous dollop of buffalo mozzarella. Enough said. Chilean Sea Bass - Delicate, butter ocean joy. Bone-in Rib Eye with a side of garlic herb butter - Juicy, tofu-tender, carnivore heaven. I chewed the meat on the bone with pride. Deep Fried Oreos - I thought my boss was joking ordering such a thing at this kind of place, but he insisted. Dipped in gelato, they were magical enough for me to lick my plate clean.  I shall return. Tongue out.",

Nightclub and rest. review  The food was amazing there.  the Waiter was fun and set a great mood for all of us at the table.  the food came out promptly and the bread was awesome.  Bad news on the bread is they charge you the second time around which is okay because it just fills you up anyway.  The only downer was that when the check came we were trying to split it and he said he could... umm no he could not, it took 35 minutes to sort out payment.. bad news my friend..lol.  Nightclub.. we had table service because in vegas you should do table service.  It was amazing.  i am not a table service virgin, we get it every time we  go to a club in vegas.  This one is worth noting however the waitress was so so, but the menu was good and cheap as well, the area was small but as soon as the other table left, we were able to bust a full on move!  the music was great i kept moving all night long.  the bouncers and table gopher were amazing.  i would love to go back there just  because we had such a great time.  don't get me wrong the club is very very small but they have a cool outside space to lounge and the bouncers weren't complete \"bags\".LAVO  was a nice change of pace. I almost didn't go because of all the negative reviews on here, and that would have been sad.  watch out in the bathroom, they tried to kick me out because they thought i was one of the girls throwing up ... i had to explain that the bathroom person can not tell black people apart.  it was kinda funny, but that is for another time!!  lol",

    "text": "Review of the nightclub only  I visited this nightclub on September 11th. As I was completely sober that night, I feel like I can review this place without the hindrance of alcohol. I went with a group of 5 girls and 4 guys, one of them who got the girls into the club for free and guys at a rate of $15 each. We were all thinking that it was a pretty good deal since girls would get free drinks until midnight. The decor was wonderful but unfortunately, that's where all the good stuff about the club stops. The club was fully packed that night, not like it was very big to begin with anyways. Rude security guards would shine their flashlights directly in your face and shout at you to keep moving in the walkways. If you didn't move (because your eyes needed to adjust to the dimly lit area, for example) they would shove you. First red flag. We made our way over to the bar where all the girls were trying to get free drinks. Timed, it took us 23 minutes until a bartender got to us, even though we were at the counter for most of that time. The AMF seemed to be watered down, as other reviews have stated. If the night had ended there, I would've left this club with 4 stars. One of our boys then got kicked out because he tapped one of the dancer/waiter girls on the shoulder asking where the bathroom was. The hostess proceeded to tell security that he groped her. The second boy was kicked out for being associated with the first. Seriously. How fair is that? The rest of us leaned on the bar because our feet were tired and there was nowhere to sit down. Security would kick you out if you sat at any of the couches along the walls because they were reserved. As we were watching a couple of people take shots, someone taps another of our guy friends on the shoulder and he gets kicked out because a dancer/waitress claimed he touched her butt. His hands were CLEARLY on the table where all of us could see them. Without warning, he was thrown out of the club, and our night ended there because were so angry at Lavo's treatment. The dancers at Lavo seem to enjoy their power and do not know the difference between an accidental brush and a grope. Needless to say, we will not be visiting this club any longer. DON'T VISIT THIS NIGHTCLUB You have been warned :)",

Definitely a great place to kick off your night.  We also watched the outside Pirates Show at TI before hand and the ambiance and ability to chat with your friends before going out clubbing was awesome.  Loved the restaurant, loved the club upstairs.  Spot on for a group of early 30s bachelorettes to kick off the party.",

    "text": "A definite must NOT visit while in Las Vegas. It touts itself as a restaurant; however, the dining room is filled with super-loud dance music and non-diners using your table space as an extension of the dance floor. The service is less than attentive, very inconsistent and includes bringing all 4 courses at once.  Additionally, the food, namely pasta and seafood is not fresh. That recognizable sweet smell of old seafood was very prominent and coupled with penne pasta reminiscent of soggy cardboard made for an unappealing dish , but when coupled with a bastardized attempt at Alfredo sauce was the deal breaker.  Don't expect the service personnel to recognize your discontentment or the manager to know what to do. I was proposed the proverbial question from a rookie manager \"what would you like me to do?\". At that point, the check and a quick exit made me happiest.",

But I want to mention what great service we had from start to finish. Being that it was the usual busy friday night we were being \"navigated \" to our table where on the way a very pleasant waitress smiled  as she stepped out of our way and wished us a great dinner! How nice! Turns out the same waitress is going to be our server. Off to a great start. Jojo was still just as pleasant and enrhusiastic as she started off w some wine and cocktail suggestions all of wich we took and loved. As dinner went on our whole table became enamoured w watching this pro at work. A table of older customers laughing smiling..clearly a bachelorette party of all girls joking about having an enviable little party w her. After encountering so many snobby money grubbing servers in vegas and all over it was so refreshing to watch a True pro at work. Everything else was secondary. She even escorted my wife to the ladies room! Wow! Blown away. Will be back again and will always request jojo!",

    "text": "RESTAURANT REVIEW ONLY - We wanted a nice dinner before attending the 9:30 PM performance of Beatles Love at the Mirage. Lavo was recommended to us as having great food and being across the street from the Mirage. Latest reservations available were for 6:15 PM on a Sunday evening, so I figured we would have a pleasant, leisurely dinner and then spend some time wandering around the Palazzo/Venetian before heading over to the Mirage. We were seated promptly at 6:15 at a table for two set up on the \"long bench\" seating along the far wall. They have small tables for two that can be moved and combined to accommodate any-sized number of group. On the ends are larger circular booths.The center of the room was set up for tables of four. The restaurant was sparsely filled at that time.The small tables and close proximity of the adjacent tables (less than 20 inches away) did not bother us at first, since they were empty. There was a group of six in the end booth on the other side of the open table next to us. Since we had an open table between us and the booth, it was no problem. We did have to rotate the table so my wife could get in to sit on the \"bench\" side. The music was so loud, I felt that I was in the night club and on the dance floor, rather than in the restaurant. I could not talk to my wife without using a very loud voice. The waitress had to keep repeating things and leaning over the table - and even then my wife could not understand much of what she said. We considered leaving to find someplace more quiet, but decided to stick it out. We ordered the special (lobster Fradiavolo). As the restaurant got busier, a couple was seated in the table for two next to us. This is when the lack of space between the adjacent tables really became apparent. It was almost as if we were all seated at the same table. They had to raise their voices so loud to hear each other across their table, that it sounded as if they were sitting with us at our table. After a few moments, he got up, went to the manager and they got seated elsewhere. Three other couples were also initially directed to this table, but when they saw how close the tables were and how loud it was, they also requested to be seated elsewhere. Eventually this table was filled as was the table for four on the other side of us. By then we were almost through with our meal and were trying to get out as soon as we could. To summarize: Positives (1) Waitress Tashia was excellent. (2) Lobster and accompanying pasta dish was very good. Negatives: (1) LOUD Music (2) Small tables - when our food came, not enough space for all the dishes - had  to combine food items - there goes the \"presentation\". (3) No \"personal space\" - tables so close that we felt like we were seated with a group on a bench in a pizza parlor. (4) Garlic bread was baked all the way through - crunched and tasted like croutons. Tashia said it was not supposed to be like this and offered to get us a replacement, but the main course had arrived and no room for the bread basket anyway.(5) Prices - I would have no problem with the prices if the atmosphere/setting were consistent with the price level (diet coke - $4.50 each, no free refills, small sides of green beans and asparagus $ 11.00 each). But when I feel like we are sitting at a fast food place or food court and I just want to finish my meal and leave as soon as possible, it's very annoying to pay that kind of price. I wished that I would have checked the reviews before booking, as there were a number of reviews that also complained about the noise:  \"loud\"; \"deafening house music\"; \"couldn't carry on a conversation\"; etc. I don't expect a night club, dance club, lounge or bar to be quiet or have a romantic atmosphere. But I had hoped for a better experience at a supposedly top class RESTAURANT. If you decide to go here for the food, which was very good, get an end booth or table in the middle of the restaurant or dine outside (thunderstorm happening when were there, so that option not available) and don't expect a romantic or conversational atmosphere - unless they turn the volume down!",

The door guy was actually nice and told us the club opened at 11 and we could have a drink in the restaurant area until then. So we sat down and a waitress brought us a drink menu. However, she never came back to take our order. We were there for about a half hour before we finally left. She stopped by many times at the tables near us but never came to our table. We eventually left and when we came back to go to the club, we were greeted rudely by the bouncer and told to not even bother since we weren't on the guest list, even though we had a VIP coupon. Zero stars!!!! There are other clubs in Vegas.",

After you wait in line to get in, you'll listen to music that encourages drinking, you will see people holding full bottles of liquor from their table service, and when you try to get through the crowd a young pup of a bouncer will stop you to see if you're intoxicated. He did this as we made our way through the thick crowd  to the bathroom. He tried to separate us( females) and take one to a back room ALONE. I became irate and demanded he go get her husband first. I would NOT allow this nor should you!  We did go back and dance and saw someone WHISKED away by the guys in dark suits to the backroom. Yet the drunk with the Vodka and the other with Patron bottle stood around. Total harassment that was extremely intimidating.",

I had one of their meatballs which was good but not heaven like some of these other reviwers claim. I also had the 8 oz filet mignon. It was overcooked. Ambiance and feel of the place was good. Tables were a little large. Employees friendly. Bathrooms clean. 3.5/5 for the restaurant. If you eat here or if you are local as I am admission will be free to the nightclub. Also, if you are a lady you will get free vodka drinks from 11PM to midnight.  I usually have a great time at the nightclub. It's one of the smallest ones I have been too but Ive also met some really cool people in here and that's what going to the clubs is all about for me. 4/5 for the nightclub.

We were staying at the Venetian so we got in for free. Thank friggin god. I would not want to pay $10 and $20 for the boy to get in here. You'll see why...   The lounge was chill. Lots of loungy couches with hookahs on each table and plenty of seats at the bar. The decor was chic, dark and inviting. I enjoyed the music much more downstairs as they played the euro-house-trance type music.   We watched an abundance of Asian girls dressed in their skimpiest Forever 21 dresses (the faces did not match the outfits...hilarious) walk the line of 20+ running sinks to the upstairs club. The space was very small.   There was a small space on the perimeter of the dance floor for table service. There were TONS of douches here with what it appeared to be hired escorts. No joke. There was another group of euro douches who were standing on their table attempting to \"make it rain\". What friggin idiot posers. Ick!

My girl stated,\"Yeah a friend of mine has hookups there.\" Truth of the matter Vegas has no hookups for men, yet we usually pay the bill in Vegas. I already know and understand this about Vegas. No biggie.  Let me illustrate to you how poorly run this waste of space is. From the beginning. The line causes confusion. You have an entrance door that within close proximity to an exit door. Once you enter, you eventually end up at the exit door. Then you ask yourself, \"Why don't they just use both doors?\" One can be used as a VIP entrance. No fire codes would be violated in the process.  Bars are poorly stocked. Lost count at the amount of times bartenders were calling for replenishments. Then you get other employees trying to squeeze past you carrying drinks \"by hand\" to get to the bartender. Aisles are super tight on the second floor. This is the main club area. Security here is inefficient too. Keep the aisles clear guys. Cmon.   Very frustrating place to be. We exited within 20 minutes.",

I'll start this off by saying that I am not a club person at all so I'm hardly in a position to offer good pointers. However I had a good time here. I was in a substantially better mood and it doesn't hurt that we had our own private area....and bottle service so I guess I'd REALLY be a tool if I had a bad time after that. I like the layout of this place better than Tao. The bar is elevated and slightly away from the dance floor so it makes getting drinks easier, and the bathrooms are much more accessible than Tao.  The music was good and it was just a much more enjoyable time. I'm willing to wager that you would like this place if you're a little older (i.e.late 20's-mid 30's) and not quite as pre-occupied with the scene. Didn't seem to be as many douches. The only downside is that there are no hot chicks in bathtubs or in clear boudoir cubicles like there are at Tao. However, if having a good time is more important than being seen, you'll probably like this place.",

It was pretty quiet at the bar, so service could afford to be friendly and attentive. The bathroom attendant freaked me out; she wasn't there when I walked in, but then she would magically appear when I came out of the stall.  Is she materializing in through the walls?  Hiding in a stall?  Weird. Really a gorgeous location.",

    "text": "LAVO was created from the creators of TAO. Where is it located? Well friends, LAVO is  located at the beautiful Palazzo Hotel & Casino! This place was the first nightclub that I started my night off in my Halloween Vegas weekend extravaganza.   Upon arriving, I saw that there was a line formed to get inside the nightclub and another to eat at the restaurant. My best friend knew the promoter and we were on the guest list. Walking in the establishment, you entered at the restaurant. The restaurant was on the first floor and the club was on the second floor. I guess this would be an ideal combination if you were dining at LAVO and then wanted to start dancing right off the bat. Burn them calories ya'll :)!  As we walked up the stairs and through the hallway, I was a bit confused of why there were a bunch of faucets with flowing water and ice cubes that were lit up. I expected like fire or something else because LAVO reminded me of lava but then reminding me that lava means wash in Spanish and  lavo means bathe in Latin. Therefore,  I concluded that it made sense for the faucets to be there haha! :D  Supposedly LAVO overlooks the The Strip where you can see one of the  best views in all of Las Vegas. When I went, however, the place was too packed and the music, vibe and the people were not very happening. There were more people just standing and sitting down  trying to look classy than getting down on the dance floor :/.  Overall, okay place to get your pre-dancing legs on. Nice decor, okay music. If you're a lady, you'll have a shot to get in for free and get some free drinks. The dance floor is small and there are stairs you need to watch out for when walking around the club.",

    "text": "So I have been to LAVO twice and it is both the best and worst Vegas nightclub I have been to. The first time I went, back in August for a friend's birthday, was awesome. My friends and I were full of liquid courage and willing to dance ourselves stupid. The second time, however, last Sunday to be precise, I had a miserable time. I went there for another friend's birthday and it was so crowded you could barely move let alone dance. That wouldn't have been so bad other than the fact that my friend was belligerent and had to be prevented from inadvertently throwing bows into people's faces. This too would have been fine if it wasn't for somebody lobbing their drink glass on to the dance floor and hitting me square in the back of the head. Luckily I didn't have anything more than a bump and headache to show for it. Suffice it to say my night was put off a bit by that incident.   Anyways, LAVO is a pretty cool club; it has some interesting decorations such as the mini sinks/ fountains in the hallway between the restaurant and the dance floor (into which my friends and I have seen some drunk fellas relieving themselves). The line to get in (for those of us non VIPs) goes pretty quickly and it doesn't seem particularly difficult to get in anyways. Also, for those of you whom the downstairs men's room confuses, the way to turn on the sink is to use the foot pedal located at its base. Oh, and if it's your birthday the bartenders are happy to make you the most potent Adios Motha F**** you have ever experienced.",

Our table waitress Crystal was adorable and attentive.      They had storage boxes at our table to put our purses in.  Nice touch.  The venue itself was nothing breath taking - not ugly by all means, but for Vegas - usually it has to have some je ne sais quo, right?  The music was typical - hip hop then change - then something else - then change, but all together was fine.  My girls were dancing on tables, having drunken fun.  And thats all that matters.",

I really am normally drunk enough that I don't notice random strangeness. But, this was far more then that or maybe I needed more drinks?   We came here after a great dinner at SushiSamba and I was so excited to check this place out hearing so much about it.   We walked in and loved the decor going up to the club area. But, it took a quick turn for the worse. Not even 30 seconds in this place we spot a little person dressed in a unique costume - he was wearing a collar and a leash that was attached to the bull nose ring on a very large woman. I looked at my girlfriends and we all had the \"WTF?\" look on our face.   We exited stage left 30 seconds later!",

The entire crew was very attentive and professional even when they were idle. No shenanigans like the employees filmed on the Food Network's Mystery Diners or Restaurant Stakeout.  The menu is simple, but delicious. I had the Spaghetti w/ Kobe meatballs with wine - surprisingly pleasant. I just assumed pasta can be like pasta anywhere else. I do wish they would include more seafood pasta on their menu, such as crab and lobster ravioli.",

The only thing I could make from it was that there were about 20 sinks lined up in a row on the way up to the dance floor. Go figure, I was confused!   The first floor is more loungey, chill, relaxing. The second floor consists of the 20 sinks I just mentioned. And the third floor is where you shouldn't go if you're epileptic. Strobe lights going, people dancing, dark then bright, loud, etc. I couldn't see much up here since it was mostly dark all the time but after say 10 minutes, we left.   Maybe I'll come back next time...but for now, it's definitely not one of Vegas' most poppin' clubs.",

It was an interesting decor walking up with floating Tuscan sinks trickling water and crystalline beads all around...and then getting into what can only be described as a Moroccan meets Greek UltraLounge.   I was amazed at how much seating there was. Finally, a club that understands you shouldn't have to pay hundreds of dollars for a VIP booth in order to be comfortable! The music was popping, and the scene was fresh...It got crowded quick after 11, and I was having a great time on the dance floor...  The drinks were a little much (12 dollar shots of Jager? Please.) But this is Lavo; the \"IT\" Venetian club on the week days...Its in a prime hotel, in a prime location...of course it'll cost a couple green ones. Check it out if you're in the 21-30 age group...",

Here goes the food:   Garlic Bread - OMG amazing. it was so tasty.  The nice thing is that this was the bread served at the table.  Looks like its baked upon being seated.  It was fresh and accompanied with tomato sauce.  Spinach Artichoke Pizza - 2 foot pizza.  It was so tasty and definitely something that can be shared at the table.  It was flaky and full of flavor. Kobe Meatball - Okay, i don't eat meat...but i was told this was to die for.  Also, our waiter told us that this is one of their signature dishes.   Ceasar Salad - definitely large enough to be shared at the table.  we didn't even finish it.  But it was tasty and flavorful.  croutons were well done.  Filet Mignon - again, i dont eat meat but i was told it was cooked to perfection.  Chilean Sea Bass - yummy, full of flavor, accompanied with tomatos.  Polenta Fries - OMG....so good.  I'm still thinking about this today.  Oreo filled Pastries with Ice Cream - Yummy...how can you go wrong?   Less one star because i've been to the club...and it's small, stuffy, and I wasn't too jazzed about it.    My new favorite restaurant in Vegas!",

The service is fast (perhaps too much so) and the food is great. Unique dishes, but not unrecognizeble. The cocktails are unique and fresh as well. The one drawback is their liberal application of sauces. Our dishes were good but would have been better with less sauce. Might want to specify this when ordering. Other than that, Lavo is worth the visit.",

I just have to accept that all dining rooms in las vegas are so dark that you need a flash light.    It's a great italian eatery with somewhat affordable prices at $22-36 entrees.    We started off with cocktails but I had a nice cava sparkling wine.  They were perfectly blended and very chic.    I had the kobe meatballs and spaghetti and one of my friends had the chicken parm.  Note that the main entrees like chicken parm do not come with sides.  Here comes ginormous mounds of food to our table.  My kobe meatballs was so delicious and such tender meat loaded with big chunks of basil.  The spaghetti was homemade!  And the marzano tomato sauce was delicious!  The chicken parm was pounded to 1\" but the length of a 9\" dinner plate.  It was smothered with cheese and looked very good.  I was so disappointed I couldn't take it home since we were going out clubbing but you definitely need a doggie bag.  The meals here fill you up!  I would recommend this for dinner but reservations book up very quickly.",

Had Saturday brunch outside on a beautiful day with friends, however, when I ordered the hamburger & it was served, I asked for mustard. That's when the silliness by the wait staff began. First, the waiter said he would go get it. Then, approximately 5 minutes later, he came to the table & said they were out. When I told him I couldn't believe a restaurant that serves burgers would be out of mustard, he laughed & said that the head chef actually hates mustard & refuses to have it in the restaurant. I had not realized the burger had already been covered with mayonnaise, which I can't eat. The fries that accompanied the burger smelled awful and apparently had been fried in some sort of truffle oil. The meat was overcooked. All in all, a pretty bad meal with a big price tag. If you're looking for a great American hamburger, although it's on the menu at Lavo, skip it. After this experience I won't be going back.",

We had 8 dudes, but even though we had a reservation and it was late (9:45)... we had to wait a bit and they sat us outside...in the 100 degree heat.  The heat wasn't a big deal, but we kind of missed out on the whole decor and atmosphere of the inside.  The kobe meatball was very good.  I just got an 8 ounce filet.  It was good... but it doesn't even come w/ a potato or anything... but the side of asparagus i got was heaping and tasty.  The filet was good though... cooked to my specifications and seasoned nicely... most other people got pasta dishes... do'nt know what they thought, but most looked pretty normal.  Service was good.  They got everything right.  Not super pricey, but pricey.  But overall I was underwhelmed... I just had the feeling that I would rather pay more to eat better or pay less to eat junky.  No real complaints... but I wasn't wowed by anything.",

    "text": "Just got back from Vegas for friends 40th and read all the reviews before we left. We went on a Friday night for dinner and the club upstairs. Here's an ''old timers'' perspective on Lavo:  Dining Space: 1) Younger crowd and place was packed at 9:30. 2) Interior had stunning decor with candle lighting to set great mood. Decor says anything but Italian but certainly spectacular. 3) Restaurant had lots of energy and DJ was mixing dance music in the dining area. Music was loud but not so loud that you couldn't have table conversations. 4) Had to wait 10 minutes with reservation. 5) Good mix of tables and booths. Large expansive space with tall ceilings. Comfortable lounge areas around large bar. 6) Good service at table given the busy atmosphere. Not a place for a quiet, romantic type dinner though hostess recommended the patio for a quieter spot for dining. 7) Extensive Italian Menu with many updated and good executions if classic Italian dishes. 8) Prices were reasonable by Vegas standards. 9) Meal came with ultra-buttery garlic bread and marinara dipping sauce which took a while to get to our table since they make batches fresh. 10)  Chicken Marsala was best I've had. Tender chicken,  rich sauce and fresh mushrooms. Wife's Filet was tender, flavorful and cooked perfect. Fried fresh Mozzarella appetizer/salad was excellent and worth the bucks. Fried polenta side also excellent as was the baked potato. Chocolate bread pudding dessert was also excellent and big enough to share. Overall very impressed with the food. 11)  Read reviews and strangely, bathrooms are a point of interest in the place.  Club Space: 1) Guy comes around to our table and asks if we intended to visit the club upstairs. He stamped our hands which allowed us to enter the club without cost and waiting in line. Ladies I guess usually don't have to pay but guys usually do. Getting free admission with dinner is a nice perk. 2) Club was small and packed at 11:00. Typical club music and decor was similar to restaurant downstairs. 3) Didn't stay long because of the crowded space but definitely a fun and lively place.  Hard to find a restaurant that pulls together a great space, food, drinks, service AND nightclub too!",

Probably the saltiest food I've had in a restaurant ever. When we told the waitress that, she didn't really pay any mind. We noticed that the same sauces and breadcrumbs were used in the apps and the entrees. At least be a little original with your dishes. I think any other restaurant would care more, but since this is Vegas, they can charge top dollar for average food. The crowds will keep coming in I guess.",

    "text": "Several things seem to be amiss with this restaurant.   One, when I made the reservation, I was told I had to make a $150.00 deposit in case I failed to show. I've NEVER heard of this policy even at some of the best, but my friend really wanted to go, so fine.  Funny thing is, with the three of us, our dinner was only $115. (We didn't order alcohol)    Two, I ordered Shu-Mai, and it came with raw shrimp and pork, which sad to say I ate half of one before I realized it. Second attempt was met with the same results.  Thankfully I eat raw ethnic food on a regular basis, so I did not get sick.       There were many other inconsistencies with service and the food, which were relatively minor, so I won't bore you, but added to the deal breakers above, I just think this place is odd.  I love raw bar, but prefer it be stated on the menu.       On the plus side, the concept and Decor was very cutting edge and made for one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been in ambiance-wise..                          All in all, too much trouble and expense for normal to below average food. (my friend liked his noodle dish)",

    "text": "***Nightclub*** To sum it up in a sentence \"The 5hit is wack\"...   So after a late dinner at First Food & Bar at Pallazo we were able to take a stroll over to Lazo to cap the night off since this seems to be one of the new spots on the strip that everybody says is oh so must go! Usually that spells disaster, as you get the clueless crowd that just wants to be seen in the newest club (even though it sucks), so they can go back to work the next day and tell the girls \"Giiiiirl, i was so f' in it up over at Lavo last night\".. i guess.  Upon entry i felt like i was going thru a maze before we finally got to what they called \"da club\", this place is SMALL. The great room in my home is bigger than this place, not to mention decorated better as well. I could tell from the moment i walked in that this place was going to be wall to wall in about 30 minutes and its going to be a mess. Unless your bottle service is comped do not waste the money, the tables are damn near on the dance floor, crowded and way too over ran with bopper kids. I have never seen a decent club with VIP table service and no security, it truly becomes a mess after it gets packed and then you have people crowding your table, trying to drink from your expensive bottle of vodka and the ability to not even really dance. We left early for Vegas time lines at 1am and said yeah never again.  I prefer that if your paying $12-$15 a drink and upward of $300 for a bottle serv'ed table that it has somewhat of an atmosphere, and gives a little more to offer than what Lavo has to offer which really was nothing special at all. Save the time and effort and go somewhere else.",

Then we ordered several of each dessert on the menu and I have to say The fried oreos and strawberry shortcake were my favorite. I would definitely go back here again for the amazing food.",

Definately a hit or miss but do not try the horrendous Chicken parmagiana or spaghetti with fresh tomatos and basil unless you have never tasted good Italian food before. In defense of the restaurant, my wife did love her lobster cocktail and zeppoli oreos, (my apple tatin was horrible). Server was very helpful, telling us to only order 1 chicken parmagiana as the size was the size of a dinner plate so it was large enough to share and also advised us against ordering another dish that she said had to be bad as whenever it was ordered it was always sent back (I think it was their braised short rib risotto if I recall). As the French say in Quebec-never again!",

It never came, in fact a table who sat after us got their bread before we did. I never got it except when my carbonara pasta came and wanted bread with it which I then asked the manager who came to check on us and sent it right away and apologized. The pasta was alright. The drinks were good and strong. In the end, again had to ask a porter/runner to get our waiter to get us the check. Never checked on us. Im not sure if its a vegas thing and they just dont care cause people will soend anyway to eat but service needs to be better than this @ Tao. Scene is nice and decor too. Thats it.",

Not enough of any of the ingredients except the olives. Tasted watered down.   Whiskey sour was nothing special, they should invest in better drinks.  NY drink was pretty good. Fresh blackberries and whiskey! -Mojito did its job, was a better choice.   Food:   Margarita pizza is a good one to share between two individuals.   Tuna tartare- the avocado chunks were too largely cut and too ripe. The sauce on the bottom was of some vinegar taste and did not mesh well with any of the ingredients and the tuna itself was so bland. Don't bother ordering this.   The sea bass was bland but the portobello mushrooms accompanied with the fish were delicious.   Side mashed potatoes were fabulous, didn't taste like the powdered kind. Was also not too heavy.   The filet mignon (medium) with Bernaise sauce was the best of the bunch. Cooked perfectly, however the outter layer was too salty.   Whoever seasons the foods needs to figure out what they're doing with their lives because they're doing it all wrong.",

The burger is great too. But I wasn't impressed with the pasta I tried, the chicken parmesan, their famous meatball, etc. it's all good but not great. So I kind of have a love/hate relationship with the dishes here! Love the restaurant itself though. Great patio right on the strip, awesome people watching, and a spacious indoors.  They do Lavo brunch, a club scene brunch on Saturday, which is always a BLAST. Service has always been wonderful.",

We got the Mac and cheese, which was very filling but a little on the salty side; delicious nonetheless. We received a complementary dessert too, which was a nice surprise too!

The one star review comes from me getting food poisoning and puking my brains out and pissing out of my back side for literally 24 hours.. while on my honeymoon. We had a reservation for dinner at 9pm. I had the seafood linguini. It was good, nothing terrible, totally fine in taste and nothing about the seafood made me think the seafood was undercooked or anything. Around 1am I started to feel super queasy. Knots in the stomach, heat flashes. I ran to the casino bathroom and spent about 30 min with my head in public bathroom toilet. Not how I wanted to spend my honeymoon.   I finally felt well enough to get into a cab and make our way back to the hotel. Where I hugged the toilet for another hour or so.   So if you're planning to eat here, steer clear of all seafood and just get two meatballs instead.",

My friend had made a reservation the day before and had requested a specific server. When we arrived the receptionist advised they could not accommodate us in his section. My friends that come on a regular basis were quite bummed by this. We sat inside and the decor is beautiful, large chandeliers and nice place settings. The crowd was everything from large groups of bachelorette parties, people with their parents, dates and the occasional well mannered children. We all got bottomless mimosas which were fabulous. I was quite buzzed walking out, which tells me that they did a good job serving up the drinks. I ordered the eggs Benedict and substituted bacon instead of ham. It came with a refreshing green salad and I really enjoyed the whole thing. Only hiccup is that I requested hot sauce (cause every egg dish needs hot sauce, right?) And it took like 15 minutes to get it, so by the time I ate my food, it was cold. For dessert, our check in with Yelp allowed for deep fried oreos with icecream. Well Im not sure if it was ice-cream or sauce, cause if it was ice-cream it was completely melted like a sauce, but tasted like icecream. Did not complain as it was complementary, but it was disappointing. The oreos though were on point, and I chowed them down. I got the pleasure of mingling a bit with some of the staff and met the Manager Mark. He was very accommodating to make sure that I was happy and that my drink was refilled and given a to go cup. I also met one of the waiters, Jason. This guy.... He is so fun. I would definitely request to sit in his section next time, if they could accommodate it. Overall, fun times and I should be back again.",

We weren't told of any daily specials despite the server asking if it was our first time which it was. It didn't appear to be particularly busy; it was a Monday night- yet our server was oddly missing for most of dinner. My girlfriends first entree, a pasta dish with chicken was extremely salty. She has a a seafood allergy so several of the other pasta dishes weren't options for her which we knew going in. Only after she had to send the 1st dish back did our server tell us about their pasta special of the day! Turns out it was something 3 of the 5 of us would have ordered had we known it existed. While waiting for my girlfriends 2nd dish to come out no one checked on us; no manager came by to see if we were okay which is pretty standard in establishments of this supposed caliber.  My food; a seafood Alfredo was good at first bite but by the 4th bite was also very heavy on the salt. And I enjoy salt! I didn't bother sending it back as I typically try to avoid doing so; but I didn't eat anymore and I didn't get it to go.   The meatball was good but the seasoning was not evenly distributed - some bites were more seasoned and some bites were blander but overall it was good.   The 2 stars are for the atmosphere because the service and the food didn't stand up to the price point nor my expectations.   Needless to say I won't be going back or recommending it to anyone else. There are much better places to spend your money.",

After we placed our order our waiter  brought is a mini coffee cake, which was hot and crusty. We were informed the first one was complimentary.  We both ordered omelets which were served with a small salad and side of home fries. The food was served hot and the presentation on the plate was very eye appealing as well as delicious. I also ordered a Mimosa which was very good.  I would highly recommend Lavo for a good dining experience with nice ambiance.",

    "text": "LAVO has become our go-to place for bouncing back from serious caloric deficiencies after a weekend of rowdy Vegas partying. The portion sizes here are gargantuan, and so too are the flavors; surprisingly, the prices aren't necessarily so, especially if you're smart about what you order:  _____________  I'm not too sure as to why LAVO seems to take heat from some for the quality of its food preparation; everything that we've had from here has been nothing short of delightful & delicious.   + If your server doesn't offer you a basket of complimentary garlic bread, be sure to request it. LAVO's take on the textbook Italian dinner bread has a distinct buttery taste & satisfying initial crunch. The marinara spread offered alongside the bread was also a winner...I'm not ashamed to admit that I shoveled spoonfuls of the sauce into my mouth when no one was looking.  + We've sampled a handful of LAVO's appetizers in the past, including the delicious Calamari served with spicy marinara. The portion size of this starter is certainly enough to feed 3, possibly 4; it's a whole lot to split among 2 (you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers if you try!). The calamari themselves are crisp, meaty, and tender - some of the best that I've had.  + LAVO makes a damn tasty wedge salad. The restaurant's take on the classic is much heartier than what I'm used to; big chunks of meaty pancetta are used in place of bacon crumbs, and the creamy bleu cheese & gorgonzola do a great job of offsetting the bold savory flavors of the various entrees. Much like the Calamari, the Wedge is practically an entree all on its own, so come hungry!  + My GF insists that the Eggs Benedict at LAVO (served during brunch hours only) was one of the best that she's ever tried. I sampled a few bites and was also quite impressed at the perfectly cooked eggs & expertly flavored hollandaise.  We weren't big fans of the accompanying side salad, however...the whole mix had a strong, overpowering onion flavor that rendered it practically inedible.   + Don't miss out on the signature Wagyu Meatball; it's as filling as it is fork-tender. I recommend pairing the Meatball with the complimentary table bread, and slathering the bread slices with big bites of Wagyu beef & rich ricotta. Well worth every penny!   + I'm pretty confident that a party of 2 can order up an appetizer & two entrees and still get away with having some leftovers to take home. This can really play to your advantage if you order in moderation - for instance, our Wedge Salad, Eggs Benedict, & Kobe Meatball came out to about $65 during our last visit...not too shabby.  _____________  + You'll immediately notice how pretty the dining area is upon stepping in. It has an upscale, yet inviting vibe that matches well with the overall decor of the Venetian resort. The high ceilings, plush seats, and ornate fixtures set the stage in a classy way that doesn't spill into being over-the-top.   + LAVO is home to what I consider to be the coolest restroom sinks in all of Vegas. The foot-operated pump mechanism isn't the most 21st century setup that I've seen, but it's quite fun to operate and makes for a hilarious photo/video op.   + Service was attentive, if a little bit scripted. Everyone was polite, but in a forced, by-the-book sort of way (i.e. \"Pardon my reach\"). Loosen up, guys! That said, I did appreciate how the waiters promptly switched the channel on the bar TV to air the NBA playoffs per my request. (Evidently, many other male diners appreciated this request - though their wives/GFs didn't look too happy to see them glued to the screen!)  - I do have to dock a star for the lack of men's room upkeep/cleanliness that I witnessed during my last visit. Paper towels & toilet paper were out-of-stock, and there were tissues scattered all over the floors of the stalls. I was surprised to see that there was no restroom attendant - it looked as though the bathroom hadn't been checked up on for quite a while. Not impressed with this, especially considering the premium sort of vibe that LAVO tries to maintain.   _____________  PRO TIP:  LAVO offers a free tray of Oreo Zeppoles + Malted Vanilla Milkshake with any Yelp check-in! Don't miss out!!",

Someone in the group recommended Lavo as being one of the best restaurants.  I used Open Table to make a last minute reservation for 6. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. The staff was very nice and let us sit where we could talk and still hear each other. Lavo used to be a night club years ago, but they still play loud dance music after 8 pm which was when we were seated.  I had the lobster which was excellent and actually less expensive than the veal parm. I felt I deserved it after a long day. Their mixed drinks are very good. For 6 of us, they included the gratuity of 22%.",

Went to the front, mentioned that I was on guestlist to about 3 or 4 people, and sent to a line that I thought was for guestlist.  Got to front of line, ID was checked, and sent inside where the lady said I needed a handstamp, or it will cost $20 each for cover.  Uhh, what? She mentioned I had to go back to the front, which I did, and of course they sent me back to the cashier, where I again mentioned I'm on the guestlist.  Apparently the fact that I had won a contest on DashBerlinWorld made things confusing for them.  Fortunately DB world had given me a printout that I was able to show them.  This is Vegas, things really shouldn't be confusing - you have a line for guestlist, a line for GA, and a line for Bottle service.  The guestlist line should have a bouncer with a clipboard and he should be checking off names while verifying ID.    Sound was good, club was definitely on the small side, drinks moderately priced at $13 for a well mixed.  Secondary bar near the bathrooms were helpful and didn't have too long of a line.    Solid 3.5 stars, rounded down due to the guestlist circlejerk.",

    "text": "Came here as part of our five year wedding anniversary celebration in Vegas. We decided on Lavo since the Venetian gave us $100 resort credit. Thank god this meal was free because I would have been pretty upset if we had to pay for it. In short, the waiter was initially very friendly and congratulated us on our anniversary.  However, once we declined cocktails because we were still feeling the drinks from the night before, his entire demeanor changed. He went from friendly and semi-attentive to non-existent. What if I was a recovering alcoholic? A Mormon? Kind of rude to treat people differently because they aren't in the mood for a $20 cocktail. I was willing to overlook the service if the food was able to make up for it, but it didn't. The burrata was tasty, but the rigatoni melanzane was completely devoid of any and all eggplant. I actually think they forgot to put eggplant into the dish. Literally just pasta, cheese and sauce. Disappointing. Again, would have been very, very upset if I had to spend my own money on this meal. You would think the Italian restaurant in the Italian hotel would be able to knock it out of the park, but sadly it did not. ALSO, they had a cute little photo booth thing at the front where we snapped some photos and put in my e-mail address to get the photo electronically. Nope, never received them. I was pretty disappointed about that because the photos we took were actually pretty cute. Oh well. You win some, you lose some - that's Vegas!",

You lurk around at Palazzo and follow the sound of thumping, booming....your feet can't help it but to follow the beat....you look into this mysterious dark restaurant and say ehhh why not?!    I was here for my sister's 21st birthday and was told for every entree you order you get a free stamp into Lavo the club.  We were told by concierge the food is great at Lavo so it's a win win.  We made reservations for 13, was seated promptly and orders were taken....unfortunately when the food arrived my mouth dropped and I was thinking....THE F did I just pay to eat COLD pasta?!  I ordered the Seafood Alfredo and Oh em gee it was cold, crusted with sauce.  The prawns on the plate looked amazing but the dish was anything but.  We also ordered the bone in rib eye. It was cooked medium rare which was fine but it wasn't anything to write home about...well actually it wasn't anything to write on YELP about.    Bottom line if you're looking for a free club this is your place.  They let ladies in for free on the guestlist and ladies drink free from 11:30 to 1am.  The dance floor is TINY.  I mean TINY!  I think it only fits about 30 Snooki's at most!    As you are bumping and grinding along strangers drinks are being sloshed all around you and sound system is horrible!  I say come here to pre party but dance and boogey somewhere else.   Ummm wouldn't come here for the food.  The consensus from our party was we paid a shit load for the food to get into a crappy club.  Just our two cents.",

Decor is really nice, though a waste of water, with those fountains by the walkway that overlooks the restaurant, haha. Of course, my OCD self had to turn off all the faucets when I walked by them..",

Music is always great, favorite is the DJ Vice Sundays but the La Freak Friday party was fun as well.   Also had dinner here. The Kobe meatball was amazing. Huge, ate it later, would want to try it with ricotta...also loved the eggplant, fresh mozerella and rigatoni....al dente...the complimentary garlic bread and tomato sauce was awesome. the only complaint was on the tuna tartare the olive on the side made it a little salty, but then again I'm not really big on tuna tartare to begin with.

Unfortunately due to rain they were unable to seat us for over two hours past our reservation time they told me that when their patio is closed it makes it really difficult for them to see all the tables. Obviously it's out of their control but they should have a better plan.   The hostess was not very accommodating when it came to informing us of the status each time but they did take care of us very well and bought us multiple rounds of drinks and all our appetizers so for me it was fine because I run on Vegas time when I'm there but for the older guys that we are with they were not happy with this.  The restaurant is a little bit louder because of the club but had a very cool bathhouse type theme. Even the restroom sinks had rain shower heads in the pedal to use for operation I definitely didn't know what I was doing the first time around.   Our server was definitely well trained in graded his job came over all the times we needed to and took care of us completely. So A+ for the server. The food was also great I had the oysters for and sea bass for my main meal. The fish was cooked perfectly but was on the smaller side for a portion.  As many other reviews mentioned this you do get access to the club Tao .   Also spotted Cory from pawn stars there.",

They cut off our girls' open bar wristbands for no apparent reason. Damn I know my girls are smokin hot but don't throw a pout cuz they didn't flirt back with you.  The line was indeed small but like any other clubs, they try to make it look poppin by allowing 1-2 persons in per every 30 mins. Not very smart & efficient. Clubs make more money off of alcohol bought inside the club & not on cover. So get everyone in fast & you'll profit from that. Duh.  My gal friend is a legit Vegas regular so we got hooked up with VIP (reduced admission for guys & no cover for girls) and line-skip tickets. It was $10 entry for guys with the VIP ticket.  The venue & space was dark, ugly, small, and awkward. Like a dirty asshole you don't wanna fuck no matter how desperate you are for some fun & action. That restaurant downstairs TOTALLY destroy the nightclub vibe. Seeing families eating while you're inebriated is not the business !!  Open bar = cheap alcohol & limp drinks. I believe there was only one big bar on top of the dancefloor. Speaking of dancefloor, it was tiny, yet there was still room to dance. Hence there were barely anyone in the club for a Sunday night.  If a club doesn't play house....I don't consider it a club. I don't mind hip hop either but the DJ was playing rap & underground rap mixed with a little bit of hip hop. Um what? This isn't some ghetto club. Play some Kaskade or Jay-Z please. kthanks.  The people...HAH. That's all I have to say  Invest your time and money at XS or Marquee !! Where the party is crackin hayyyyy",

    "text": "This review is for the nightclub aspect only.  It's challenging to review a Vegas club because all of them suffer from fundamental problems that drive almost any man with a whit of intellect completely batshit crazy. Here's the thing, Lavo is the next evolution in Vegas club nonsense.  The lines can be ridiculous of course, but these aren't any worse than other clubs ... which is to say that they are a miserable experience.  The worst, most offensively miserable aspects are how insanely crowded the place is and the staff here. So how crowded is it?  I liken it to the people who try to mash their way into Walmart when it opens on Black Friday ... except constantly. I'm pretty sure that every day when they clean up the place they find two or three trampled girls in skanky outfits who just got lost under the mob. The heat can become unbearable and you'll be begging to leave this steam bath Hell ... but to no avail because you are so cramped in that you can't leave and you are forced to remain there and have people sweat on you. I think they call it Lavo as a reference to a sauna in a bath house.  Now the staff ... well bouncers are moronic assholes, Vegas bouncers are SUPER moronic assholes, and Lavo bouncers are their kings. These guys are incredibly unreasonable and pushy. They have no concept of listening to logic and are happy to deny you entrance to the club because you happen to want to throw away your drink yourself.  It gets a second star because the decor of sinks and bathtubs is pretty cool and we met ONE line watching staff member who was cool and talked about sports with us. Otherwise if you have a Y chromosome and two neurons, prepare yourself for a visit to the steamy underworld.",

Thought the al a care sides were a bit over-priced compared to the prices of the main dishes, but it's Vegas :)  One thing I appreciated was that since we ate dinner there, we could get into the night club that night for free (we were too tired, so we didn't go).  The atmosphere is amazing - gorgeous decor. The only thing I didn't like about this place are the close proximity of tables to one another. I could almost touch my neighbors on both sides of me which made it difficult to have a nice private meal with my hubby. Otherwise - I loved this place!",

    "text": "**Review for the ultra lounge**  Waited patiently in line with my boyfriend before a promoter approached us asking us if we were on the guest list. We told him that we--unfortunately-- were not. He asked us if we were guests of the hotel-- once again, we were not :( He asked us if we were staying on the strip... And you guessed it-- we were not.   After we were sure he was going to move on to the party behind us, he quickly reassured us, \"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it.\" Next thing we knew, we were in for FREE! Thanks, Promoter Guy!   Like many others have said, this lounge has a very dark and sexy vibe to it. Others have complained about the minimal dance space and the smallness of the place itself. However, I feel it's very intimate and romantic. If you don't feel like getting trampled or pinned up against sweaty strangers all night, I'd say ultra lounges are the way to go!   This place was pretty amazing. Getting in for free-- without guest list reservations or hassle, attentive bartenders, pretty decent music (a lot of the songs were hit or miss, but I think that's relatively subjective depending on the DJ for the night), no chaos of a typical club. This place gets a thumbs up in my book! My boyfriend and I had a blast! will definitely be back.",

For dinner we shared veil parmesan and spaghetti with Kobe beef meatballs (yeah, we loved the Kobe beef meatball soo much we had to get some more).  Both dishes were great, tasty and cooked to perfection.  Tried 3 deserts, tiramisu, strawberry shortcake and raspberry cheesecake (we took the strawberry shortcake and the raspberry cheese cake home for the kids).

Drank movet champagne the good stuff. ate delicious italian style brunch- including salad, fries, mini pizza, chicken parm, more good stuff. Good music good vibes. !!!

I had an excellent experience dining by myself, drinking my glass of cabernet, making eye contact with the hot guy across the restaurant, and enjoying every bite of my food.

The eggplant parm was great and HUGE (better be at $18). For dinner I got the 8oz. filet. It was cooked perfectly.  We went to the club upstairs with no wait or charge since we ate at the restaurant.

My pharmacy friends and I wanted to really dance the night away, so after receiving free VIP passes earlier on in the day for Lavo, we decided on it. Looking into the restaurant, the decor was great, so we went to the club inside. Being girls, we of course, did not even have to stand in line, and was escorted straight in with free cover and free drinks. How great is that! The sinks along the stairway are really cool as well, as they actually have running water along them.   The music was GREAT. Not a bad song at all, the whole night. My only gripe was the SIZE of the place. The dance floor was really small... being small asian girls, we got pushed around until we made our way onto the stage.. where we found our other pharm people. The crowd itself was a little strange as well.. I couldn't really determine the make-up: it was a mix of mid twenties with mid thirties mixed into it. As Vegas is a place of vacation-ing, everyone we met was there for some conference or on business.   I don't think I would ever go here to meet people, but if you're looking for a place to dance the night away with some friends, this place is definitely a fun place to go!",

You'll walk through a glassed hall with antiqueish-looking sinks running water.  There is a bar with couches along the sides, and a dance floor with VIP seating surrounding it. Downstairs is where the lounge and restaurant is at. If you want to chill outside, you have to go from the lounge area.   The bartenders are the nicest compared to all the other Vegas clubs. Tip them generously the first time and they'll hook you up sick the rest of the night. The DJ played an awesome mix of music and that really is important when you're partying and getting drunk. What topped the night was P. Diddy showing up. From then on, it was a \"Bad Boy\" night. The DJ played all his old hits and everyone just went hog wild.    If I had to choose between Tao or Lavo, I'd definitely pick Lavo. I love the location (inside Palazzo), and I love the decor. Lavo will definitely be a place I'll frequent when I'm in town.

    "text": "LAVO pretty much ruined my Vegas trip. We were in Vegas for my girlfriend's birthday and we were staying at the Palazzo. The greeter at the door I guess worked at TAO nightclub and told us that if we ate here than we would receive free express entry into the nightclub for every entree that we purchased. TAO just happened to be the nightclub that all the girls wanted to go to and we were on the hungry side.  We sat down and our waiter split us up into two tables. I wanted to get my usual seafood linguine, but I had it the night before so I was persuaded to try something else. I asked the waiter for his recommendations and he told me the swordfish.  It's a pretty spacious room and you get to see everyone drinking their Voss bottled water. I thought it was weird that the sinks of the restrooms were visable from downstairs. Not the best layout in my opinion; when your guests can enjoy their meal and watch their fellow patrons drop a twosie.  Even though we were seated and waited on at the same time as the second half of our party, the food arrive at very different times. We all pretty much ordered the same items, but everything came out sporadically. Not that I wanted my entree to be rushed out... The swordfish was dry and the serving size was pretentious. I understand that they were probably shooting for French servings, but when I saw the hefty dishes that others in my group received, I was a bit peeved.  Nonetheless, this was not even the worst part of the night. The worst part came, when we got to TAO and the bouncers told us that the stubs that we received were only good at LAVO. At this point, I had had enough. I called over to LAVO and made my complaint to the hostess. She tried to convince me that for the longest time, the stubs would only allow them entry into LAVO. I argued with her and she even accused me of lying. After long deliberation, I spoke with the manager and she told me to get in contact with the manager at TAO. When I got back to TAO, the retarded bouncers wouldn't even let me talk to the manager. I'm surprised those Neanderthals knew how to conjugate words into sentences. Eventually I get to someone who I think can help me and they end up telling me we can get in with the stubs and that's how it's always worked. They need to get their freaking facts straight.  Worst experience I've ever dealt with. I already had distaste for nightclubs in Vegas. This was just the straw that broke the camel's back.",

Sadly I remembered that there was only ONE bar in that whole area, but whatever, we had fun.",

It was Dinner time and we had just gotten into Vegas, although we were treated as if they were super busy and about to close down.  I was still eating and they kept trying to take my plate away.  I paid ALOT of money and I am going to eat until I'm done.  We got a bottle of wine, we are going to enjoy ALL of it.  I expected better service.  We didn't have one person help us twice, which may have led to some of the confusion and we were on the main walkway.  I will say, the meal was AMAZING, best steak ever.  The haricot vert was delish, so were the mashed garlic potatoes.  They were also having some type of business meet/greet in the bar and we were kind of afraid that the place would transition to night club mid-meal.  The atmosphere and food are the only saving graces here.  Service was poor.  Bar staff was dressed for nightclub (slut",

We ended up waiting for 20 minutes, and the manager apologized and brought us a round of drinks of our choice, which isn't such a shabby way to start dinner.   The atmosphere is perfect for a group of friends or family on a special occasion- the decor, lighting, and the music is something straight out of your dreams.   With 7 hungry girls, we shared 6 plates and a salad, with leftovers! The highlight dishes were mixed seafood linguini and rigatoni melenzana (both were so tasty! and huge portions!). I ordered the grilled swordfish which is perfect in every way- light, salty, and citrusy, but the portion is not for sharing.   The spinach and artichoke pizza was pretty good, but not memorable, while the ravioli and spaghetti carbonara were average.   Don't order the fries. Just enjoy the complimentary garlic bread instead.",

Gabriel and Dresden spinning some of the best remixes in the house music genre and a bunch of original songs.  Only downside, I think less than a third of the crowd had actually heard of them, typical las vegas. Flipside to that was it was not that crowded, you could walk right up to the DJs.  Complementary glowsticks got a little annoying by the end of the night.",

We had an absolute blast at Lavo, even though it was a Sunday night! They had all the latest music and the crowd danced non-stop. The dance floor wasn't too crowded until around midnight, when a huge VIP b'day group came in and ruined it for the rest of us :( After getting soaked by 2nd hand drinks for the rest of the night, our group decided to call it quits and move on to the casinos.   Had the toughest time finding our way in and then back out though!!  Crazy maze of a place.",

I got the braised rib special which pretty much melted in my mouth. The bottle of wine we ordered did not disappoint. Much better quality than the LAVO in nyc. The service was exceptional. My only complaint would be the creamed spinach. Gross. Took one bite and left it there. So really I'd only give it 4.5 stars. Hint hint yelp, let's get working on the star ratings.",

Those of us that had our VIP passes (from the race) skipped the wait in line and got right in. Three levels of Lavo. First one being the bar with cushy seatings and small cozy tables, packed of course. Second level more small tables ( Lavo is an Italian restaurant and night club). Third level, club area-packed, and really small. Kind of hard to walk through but we did have a blast over all!! I kept hearing about their ragu with big balls (as in meatballs) and decided on my next visit to try them, everyone keeps raving about these balls!!",

Lavo was great at helping setup the special event complete with a specially ordered cake that they took delivery of and had ready for us at dinner.  That's going the extra mile.  They really catered nicely and made the night memorable.  The staff took pictures, suggested food, kept the drinks flowing, had some friendly conversations, and it  was all truly authentic and sincere.  As for the food it was hit and miss on a few items.  Bread - very good garlicky and toasted  Calamari - just your average calamari nothing special about it  Kobe meatballs - all though I feel a meatball is a waste of kobe beef, this was flavorful and a filling appetizer.  Rigatoni Sausage Bolognese - Pasta was a bit undercooked and sauce wasn't anything special   With the dinner we got free entry to the night club and got to skip the line.  The club itself is really small compared to other places like XS and Marquee.  Its more like a bar with a small dance floor.  We got in when it was pretty empty then they let the general line in and the place filled up wall to wall in the blink of an eye.  We decided to leave after that since it was pretty uncomfortable with no room to relax.  They do play mainstream hip hop though which is hard to find in Vegas these days.  As far as a foodie destination or hot club, individually LAVO doesnt really deliver.  However if your planning a special dinner and drinks event than its a pretty nice all in one package and the staff will work to make it a memorable night.",

There was quite a line outside, but he was able to walk our group of girls in for free. There aren't many clubs open on Sundays in Vegas so LAVO was great for pre-party.  The club is upstairs and really pretty. The walkway is lined with these water fountain-like things, very classy and chic. Having only gone to Surrender at the time, LAVO seemed amazing and very well-decorated.   Compared to other clubs like XS, LAVO is a bit small, especially the dance floor. It was already packed before 12am. I enjoyed the music though, and the crowd seemed a little younger. The drinks from open bar were pretty watery, but the cocktail waitresses were really hot.   Bottom line: come here for the open bar. Maybe dance a little.",

After looking at the menu online, I initially didn't think it would be nice enough- the prices seemed too low. Once I saw the amazing Morrocan decor and noticed a DJ spinning sexy deep house music, I knew this was the ideal spot. The place feels hip and there's a great energy to the ambience and the people watching. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are HUGE! The pastas and entrees were amazing though I wasn't as wowed by the Margarita pizza.  We experienced an issue with one of our meals and the manager (Destyn) was remarkably attentive to resolve it. She asked if we were going to the club after dinner and she actually took the time to personally walk us to the front of the line.  Everything about this place is cool, but it still manages to feel approachable and friendly. I love it and can't wait to go back!",

As hotel guests, I'm sure the Concierge could have hooked it up for us, but as I knew a promoter, my girls and I got a VIP table and open bar from 11pm-midnight. Really, the BEST way to pre-party on a Sunday night.  LAVO is a really nice spot for lounging, especially for a group of girls. The whole space is very chic and intimate, with the restaurant on the lower level and the club on the top. The cocktail servers are all gorgeous - loved their hot corset dresses - and very attentive. Once we were out of a drink, they were right on it.   The crowd was very mixed - an all ages kind of spot. While it was awesome to see a female hitting the decks, the music was also very mixed and after Mariah Carey's \"Fantasy\" came on, it was our cue to leave. Not that I have anything against Mariah, but I like singing that song at a karaoke club.  Tip: The promoters all hang out inside the restaurant, and they're pretty easy to spot as they're the guys in suits on their Blackberries surrounded by women.",

When we were there on a Saturday night about 10 PM, there was a young crowd. I would say more than 80% of the patrons were under 30 years old. The tables are close together and I felt like the couples on both sides of us were way, way too close. Lots of bachelorette parties.  I guess what I'm saying is the atmosphere is either great, if you want young, loud and high energy, or horrible if you're looking for a more quiet sophisticated dinner.    Onto the menu.  The chopped Louie salad was awesome. Lots and lots of seafood mixed with crisp greens. Large enough for a meal. On the other hand, the pastas were a severe disappointment for an Italian restaurant. The sauces were all very salty and the noodles were so soft that they compared to gnocchi in texture. I would not recommend a pasta dish here.  3 stars or less for the pasta let down and the fact that I was screaming at my date to talk over the DJ music and noise. We also felt rushed. The waitstaff was attentive, but were clearing our plates the second after we finished our last bites of food. We were literally still chewing our food when asked, \"are you done yet?\"",

    "text": "Food: I actually went to eat here once with my girlfriends for a comped dinner 5+ girls. Not sure if they do this anymore but It consisted of a 5 course meal with drinks in between to add to the dishes. Didn't taste just Italian but Mediterranean to me. It was delicious and after dinner and the drinks from dinner I was already buzzed.   Club: Small and very crowded unless you have a table, because its so small the range of people who come here are mostly music lovers who come to enjoy the headliners that are booked on days like Tuesdays. The design of this place kind of sucks once you walk in you have to walk up stairs. Girl's like me in 4 inch heels ya... it sucks.  Music: definitely my taste in music, Trance. Even though this place is small they throw one hell of a party. The lights, go go dancers, confetti, and the foam glow lights they give out definitely add to the craziness of this place.   Bar: There's 1 and 1/2 of a bar in this place, yes very small. The main bar is always packed but there's a male bartender there that's super nice and I tip him well because he makes my drinks strong just the way I like it.",

The music was good and we had a blast! We got stamped and had wristbands that allowed us to go to Tao after 12:30 pm. The entire night was awesome because we only had to mobilize from one property to another. We didn't have to wait in any major lines and the promoters took care of us.   The icing on the cake: being able to walk to the Grand luxe cafe for drunk people dining. It's a ritual for us when in Vegas!!",

Starting with the host who greeted us at the door, continuing with the lovely young lady who sweetly chatted with us as she seated us, then continuing with our knowledgeable and friendly server, JoJo, and the adorable red-haired young man who kept our water full and our faces smiling with his pleasantries and multiple birthday wishes, the service was great.   We even got a truly sincere and pleasant visit from the manager who promised us that he was tremendously proud of his staff (a staff he and the other members of the managerial group there have trained well).    And, of course, the food was awesome. That meatball. Holy cow. Pun intended.   Go here. And, if you can, save room for dessert!",

The manager on site for Saturday night text us for our table, we missed the text due to visiting with family that we had not seen in over 20 years. After checking with the front desk the manager stated \"they gave our table to someone else and did not know if he could accommodate us\" instead of causing a scene we offered cash for a table and it's like voodoo a table for 5 suddenly appeared. I complained to the onsite manager this morning, he was very kind. Received a call from last nights manager and he stated he never received money to seat us. He called to call me a liar!

This place exceeded my expectations!  They even have a live DJ playing music in the restaurant (not loudly, just the right volume to set the tone for a night out in Vegas).  A group of us went for my birthday.  The meal was amazing, the service was awesome, the birthday spanking by our waiter in the middle of the restaurant was unexpected.  A number of people in our party ordered steaks (which they are still raving about), my husband got their infamous meatball (it was both delicious and HUGE).  Good times, great food, cool ambiance.",

The only dish that wasn't great was the eggplant parm. It had seitan in it that have it a weird texture and taste.   Best thing on the menu: DEEP FRIED OREO DESSERT!! The batter taste a bit like a beignet with powdered sugar and of course the yum yum vanilla shake that comes with it! Eat it right away while it's still hot!",

The food and the drinks were tasty, but the SERVICE...where do I begin...The place wasn't very busy when we arrived at 9 on a weeknight. The bartender was rude and acted like we were bothering him. We sat outside in the patio and it took FOREVER for the Asian server girl to greet or offer her serverness. She was rude and standoffish. I made a comment to another server about getting the manager and she quickly changed her tune, but the damage was done. The Treasure Island show can cancelled due to wind advisory so that was a bummer too. We went to the lounge around 10 and it was drab and lifeless. I realize it was early in the night for Vegas, but the Trance music was meh. The bartenders up there though,  we're a 180 from the ones downstairs- nice, approachable, talkative, respectful, attentive... But the vibe for the place just wasn't there for me that night. I will likely not go back unless there's someone majorly cool as a guest.",

We were lucky enough to sit at a table and the vibe and atmosphere was perfect for a few friends celebrating a birthday. The decor and seating makes you feel like you are in an old library!   LAVO brunch is NOT WORTH IT! After having a great time the night before, we wanted to continue the celebrations over brunch. After 30 minutes of waiting for a table, we then waited another 30-45mins before we were able to order food! This type of service is understandable if it is crowded, but it was not. There were many open tables. When we brought it up to our waiter, his excuse was \"Well the kitchen is on the second floor so we are running up and down stairs\". If this is what causes the bad service, then something needs to be fixed!   Besides the wait, the food was okay. Definitely not the a top choice for brunches in Las Vegas and I don't think I will be back anytime soon.",

We devoured the delicious chefs tasting which was served family style. Everything was divine. I especially loved the signature Lavo giant meatball, carbonara, rib eye, chicken parmigiana (which is so unique and unlike any other I have ever had), and the chocolate and peanut butter birthday cake. I will continue to come back here every time I come to Vegas. I wish they would open one in Los Angeles where I live so I could become a regular. Lavo is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.

    "text": "Review of Restaurant Only  Surprisingly walked in with no reservation at around 10ish for dinner. Great decor, good food, but I had higher hopes for the actual atmosphere of the place.  Prices are up there, $28 dollar ravioli gets you 6 ravioli that are maybe an inch and a half in diameter. So if you're really hungry you might want to order an appetizer. The food came out within 5 minutes before the bread made it out and we wound up getting our garlic bread with sauce to dip in when we were almost through with the meal. I could probably have eaten the whole plate of garlic bread myself. So good. Tiramisu is a a large enough portion for 2 to easily share.  Things I didn't like... The square tables are awkward to sit at. the foot of the table blocks the space where your feet would normal be so if you decide to wear a dress like I did you wind up with your knees together and one foot on each side of the bottom of the table. Paper on the tablecloths are kind of annoying when you're paying almost $30 a plate. The majority of people there seemed like groups of girls and the (pretty loudly) music made me feel like I was at a bachelorette or girl's 21st birthday. Girl's Just Wanna Have fun and the like played for most of the time I was there until they just gave up and played a Michael Jackson's greatest hits CD. Tables with groups of tipsy ladies squealed and stood up mid dinner to sing and dance at their tables accordingly.  Probably wouldn't come back unless I was with a group that was dying to come here, especially since there's a Lavo in NYC now and its not somewhere I can only go on vacation.",

It is a fun atmosphere and they have great cocktails in pitchers!! WOO HOO PITCHERS!! The one we ordered tasted like candy!   Shared a bunch of appetizers and pizzas. They start you off with some amazing garlic bread. We followed it with the giant meatball (it really is giant) . Some Calamari which was good though I am not a huge fan of Calamari.   Next was the beet salad and the Ceaser salad, both were crisp and fresh. We followed this off with 3 pizzas. It was too much food for 7 girls and we had some pizza left over. All three pizzas we tried were yummy and packed with flavors.   Overall it was very reasonably priced as well. The manager came by, congratulated the bride to be and made us a round of shots. Great service, great experience I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas.",

The four of us stuck to food only and ordered a variety of meals.  Started with the 16oz ricotta meatball which was a great share.  Well seasoned, moist and covered with a proper sauce.  It was easily one of the best choices for the night and we all enjoyed it.  For entrees my peers ordered the chicken parm, risotto special and a variety of sides.  Everything was cooked properly and the risotto looked especially good.  Had a great consistency, color and flavor according to my friend with a perfectly cooked lobster tail atop.  They couldn't stop raving about the chicken parm which was pounded nice and thin with a beautiful breading.  It was a traditional dish and executed well.  I had the chicken Dominic and this was the surprise of the night.  It was seated and roasted to a crisp skinned beauty.  Nicely carved off the bone and presented with the thigh and breast covered in a pan sauce.  I loved the touch of red pepper spice to give context and another level to the garlic and pan sauce dominates flavors.  The spice and savory blend is brilliant to the dish!  I wasn't expecting this well executed of a meal but I would recommend it to anyone visiting looking to get out of the steak house and have something a bit more comfort based.",

    "text": "I booked a corporate team dinner here. Their sales guy for large events, Jeff, was great to work with. He was super responsive and easy to work with. The night of the dinner, the restaurant had our table ready early and even started appetizers for us early so they were there when we sat down. The manager on site, Mark, was very accommodating and helpful.   We tried the marguerita, four cheese, and the Wagyu meatballs for appetizers. The meatballs were pretty good, I liked that they came with extra sauce. They were huge. Each one fed 4 people. The marguerita pizza was kind of dry and not very flavorful. The four cheese pizza was really good. Then we had the spring mix salad and the burrata salad. Both were very fresh and delicious. They gave you very generous portions of burrata cheese which was nice.   For the entrees we did chicken Marsala, NY Strip Steak, and the penne pasta with tomato/basil. The chicken Marsala was nothing special. The mushrooms and sauce tasted a little burnt. The NY Strip Steak was cooked perfectly for me (red in the middle). It was tender and yummy. It came with 3 different sauces. A green peppercorn, horseradish, and chimichurri. All we're good but the chimichurri was my fav. The pasta was good, with lots of big chunks of tomato.   For dessert, they brought out a plate with assortment of desserts on it. There was strawberry shortcake, bread pudding, and chocolate swirl cake. All were very tasty! The strawberry shortcake was my fav. It had 3 layers of a dense cake with big chunks of strawberries and whip cream in between.   Our head server for the evening was Renee. He was awesome! He stayed on top of everything all night. He kept the courses coming out at a good pace and kept everyone's drinks full. Overall, we enjoyed it. The restaurant does get very loud with so many people crammed into one room with loud music in the background so don't expect a nice quiet dinner.",

That baby turned into four high quality Blackberry margaritas, each served with a large amount of Patron silver.  You can not complain about the quality of the drinks in this bar. Service is excellent, bar tenders are quick and efficient and the wait staff is supurb. Friendly people everywhere.....  The lounge is very large and was filled with early evening drinkers and diners. The seating looks quite comfortable. The bar holds about 20 patrons..... I would think this would be an enjoyable club when the evenings are comfortable enough to go on the terrace and enjoy a Shisha pipe or hooka as some people call them.  The charge for the set up is a bit steep, but still would afford you and your friends an excellent experience.  I tried their Beef Kabobs, with Olive polenta, scallions and lime - they were outstanding. I also dined on the Kobe meatballs - also very nice. The menu has a large variety of selections -  including Spanish Payae. dishes.  I found Lavo to be a quality experience. A club in the making .... I hope they do well.",

The club itself is very small and is usually so overcrowded. This night Telemundo had an event and they playes Latin all night which is my favorite so I was pretty happy with the music.

I don't understand what the reservations are for if they don't even honor the time frames.  When it came to ordering our food I ordered the cheese ravioli and it was pathetic what I was served. I regret not taking a photograph. It was 6 raviolis in a circle sauce in the middle of the plate and topped with a little parsley. It was very bland and I was super hungry. Our bill came out to $75.00 and tipped $10 so a $85 meal including what my husband ordered and we walked out hungry and tried to figure out where we could go to eat something else.  Won't go again. Olive Garden would have been. More food and half the price.",

    "text": "As a local, I am fully aware of what the Vegas night life has to offer. LAVO, unfortunately, does not bring much to the table. I have witnessed the worst service imaginable, here, and I hope that this never happens to anyone else.   I was in a party of 9 females and 2 males at a table. We were upgraded to the VIP tables and instantly, it's as if we were being watched like dogs-- not to mention being treated as such, as well. The rather large security guard attempted to escort one of the females of my party from the club for being \"too out of hand\". (I know this woman and how she acts when she is drunk and I can assure you she was not.) When clubs kick girls out for being too drunk, they are supposed to document it. Her ID was not checked, her name was not written down. Not only did they fail to properly execute this, they left her outside of the casino on the street by herself at 2 in the morning. She did not have her phone, wallet, or a ride home. I'm fairly certain under no circumstances are you supposed to leave a young, single female alone on the strip at that hour, or any other time of the day for that matter. Especially if your job is to protect and ensure safety...? No one else from our party was notified or had any idea where she was. No one, not even other security guards, had any answers. It took us 2 hours to finally find her, wandering in front of the casino entrance.   I can only imagine what could have happened if she were drunk to begin with. She could have easily been assaulted, taken advantage of, or worse. The actions of this establishment are extremely unacceptable. That is not the way you treat your guests. Mind you, we were even paying (and tipping) for our table services and alcohol. Which makes me question how they treat people who don't.  I am disgusted by this place and I will never be returning here again. I can only suggest that you do the same. You have been forewarned.",

I think I had some kind of a sushi and drinks and they were all good.  We went to the club afterwards, make sure you get your Server to stamp you so you can jump the line in the club and not pay a cover charge at the club.  This is for people \"in the know\" only.  So now you are in the know!  Great dance place, good music.  The usual pretty people, dancing girls, etc. You'll love it if you like that kind of scene....",

    "text": "The only reason we came to check out this place was because it was in The Pallazo where we were staying.  We were assured by the Casino host that we'd get in no line, no cover.  He instructed us to ask for Fred or Jeff, whatever his name was.  First off there is NO guest list line, there is only a General Admission line and Bottle Service Line.  There were only about 10 people in line anyhow.  So when we got to the front of the line we were met by this Jeff/Fred guy.  We politely told him that our host had called and put us on the list.  He tells us no, I don't see your name.  We then show him the card of the casino host thinking he might jog his memory.  Jeff/Fred says we have no idea who that is.    My friend was getting agitated not by the fact that we had to pay cover for this crappy place that looked dead on a Saturday, but by the fact that this guy was acting like your typical nobody doorman that thinks he's somebody.  Anyhow, we said screw it we'll pay for the cover.  No point wasting our time trying to sort things out.  The  Jeff/Fred doucebag then tells us that my friend can't come in because he's drunk.  Me and my friend drink all the time and I know when he's \"drunk\".  He was not drunk.  My theory is the guy just couldn't handle our we don't give a damn and we're not gonna kiss your ass attitude.  Get a life man.  We weren't dying to get in to Lavo.  You had 10 people in line on a Saturday night @ 12am!  Could your poor attitude and customer service skills be the reason.  Hope you're management is paying attention to this post.    The clincher to this is after we partied elsewhere and got back to our rooms my friend had a voicemail on his phone from the casino host confirming that everything was all good and that he spoke to this Jeff/Fred guy confirming our that we'd get in.",

We had the Kobe Stuffed Rice Balls (CRAZY GOOD), calamari and Caccitore Pizza with fresh Parmesan cheese:) The complimentary garlic bread with/marinara was also delish! For our group this was just enough food to coat the stomach before a night full of drinking. Would definitely like to check this place out a \"little\" bit earlier in the evening for a full dinner.",

I've been to other Las Vegas nightclubs, and although this place doesn't make you \"feel\" like you're in Vegas because of the toned-down ambiance and decor compared to the other over-the-top establishments, I still feel like I had the time of my life! The DJ played music that I enjoyed and was able to dance to (mostly Hip-Hop/Top 40s/90s). There were a few songs that were played 2-3 times that night, but that's ok since I didn't really notice until after I left the club (it was brought up in discussion between me and my friends).   Our group did bottle service this evening. I've done bottle service at other places, and I can say that the service here was just ok. There were times where I had to ask where our personal bartender/waitress was. Where at other places they are extremely good about making sure that your assigned detail was always there when you needed them. The security dude was pretty good at making sure that no one invaded our area as there was this one drunk chick that decided to sit in our designated area and that was handled quickly.   So, some may call this place too small but I'd rather look at it as intimate. And although I did find a few things that I didn't like, those things are extremely minor and you can definitely count on me coming back to this place!",

    "text": "The Menu is very deceiving.  If you get a house special don't expect to get pasta with it like you would at a normal Italian restaurant. Which is what happened to me when I ordered my chicken Milanese and my friend who ordered a shrimp scampi. So I guess you can only get \"pasta\" in the pasta section. The spaghetti carbonara was extremely oily and too salty.   The Service was TERRIBLE and it wasn't even a busy night. We went on a Monday night around 6:30pm and it was pretty steady not overly crowded so I really don't understand the delay that we had with our meals.The appetizers arrived in a very timely matter, but after that it took about 45 minutes for the entrees to get to our table. The waiter never checked on our table to see if we liked our food until the very end when he knew we were upset. My friend ordered a baked potato as a side dish that didn't even arrive till the very end of the meal and they didn't even notice that we were missing one. Once we mentioned that we were waiting for our side it still took them almost 25 minutes to even bring it out to us, on top of that the baked potato was COLD! By then we were already done with the meal and asked if the potato could be taken off the bill. The only think I can say was good is that I never ran out of water because the bus boy was the only tentative one. I will not be returning.",

My friends and I visited during CES so all of Vegas was packed!  We first tried our luck at Tao but the line was wrapped around the shops so we decided to try LAVO.  We decided against getting a bottle at LAVO just because it was so small and we weren't sure how long we were going to stay.  We ended up making the right decision because the nice part about LAVO is that they allowed us to sit at the tables without having to purchase bottle service.  The drinks were expensive and nothing to special about them but typical Vegas nightclub pricing but they sure were strong.  The DJ that they had that night was just a house DJ but he was pretty good; spinning mostly top 40 with a bit of EDM and house mixed in.  I would recommend LAVO if you're looking for a smaller club experience and a place to chill with some friends that doesn't require bottle service to have a good time.",

    "text": "As a nightclub in Vegas, LAVO is pretty poppin' on a Friday night!!! The first time I came here was about 2 years ago, it sucked and a lot of the reason is because of the crappy music they played. Nowadays, it's hard to find a Vegas spot that DOESN'T play house music and really though, I just wanna be able to hear familiar music that I can easily sing & dance to. House is just not my cup of tea! This second visit to LAVO definitely changed my opinion about it. Music was Top 40's, rap, & hip-hop with occasional house music every now & then, but hardly ever. Have I fallen in love and have plans to frequent this place in the future? DEFINITELY.  With a friend's hook up from a promoter, we got in pretty quickly around 11pm w/ no cover, the ladies got free drinks until 11:30 with wristbands, & me & my party got our drank on. Though we had plans to only stop by here for a bit for free drinks and head on out to another club, we ended up staying here & literally danced the night away til 3am! Yes, LAVO isn't the most gorgeous club nor spacious with places to sit if you don't have a table (which is why I didn't give the 5th star due to it getting extremely hot and crowded!), but it's got the lounge feel and a dance floor that's decent enough for you to get your groove on. If you're looking for something lowkey, this is the spot.   Thus, for anyone that's staying at the Palazzo/Venetian, check this place out since you can go to the concierge and get your name on the guest list. Or even if you're just looking for a chill place with music you can sing and dance to without having to think to yourself, \"how do I dance to this music??\" (sorry yall, that's what house music does to me...), do come here! I hear some nights are salsa nights and what not, but call ahead to ask if music is your concern. DJ VICE also spins on a few Sundays and they have celebs every now and then that host parties. LAVO, it's worth a try...even if you have to come twice to love it!",

The meat ball is one of their signature dish, the shrimp cocktail is probably the less impressive dish.  The meat ball is flavorful, juicy and very tender.  Most dishes are on the oily side.  The size of the dishes are huge, so we usually share.  Besides the wait to be seated, its not a bad italian restaurant.",

Went here on a busy Las Vegas Friday night when DJ SKRATCHY was spinning. He kept the crowd live and moving until past 330am. Played club classics as well as the requisite Top 40 hits and mash-ups. Most def, great times... So as long as he's providing the soundtrack, I'll continue to support the place.  I've also hung out downstairs at the Lavo lounge. Liked it a lot as well. It has a wrap around patio facing the Las Vegas strip and directly across the TI hotel & Casino. Much more mellow and more room to circulate than the club, of course. They have a DJ playin music. And also hookah pipes available at the tables outside.  More DJ Skratchy please.",

The only thing I can comment on is the club upstairs with no consideration of its prices.  Clubs in Vegas all seem the same to me.  This particular place does not stand out.  The dance floor was decent sized, but not huge.  There are multiple levels of platforms with about 50% of the club walled off for \"VIP.\"  The problem with this club is mainly that there is no place to sit.  You have a dancefloor, some VIP couches, and a second platform with more couches.  That's it.  I mean, what if you want to have a meaningful conversation?  LOL.  Like that happens in Vegas.  The crowd: Lots of people.  All ages, shapes, sizes, races.  A lot are drunk.  Most are friendly.  Bonus points for having a 5'9\"-model-who's -a-former-starting-shortstop-at-Arizona-State hanging around.  Negative points for having bouncers cockblock her from my 6'3\" friend by walling her off in the VIP area.  Sigh.  Such is life.",

He didn't bring the bread as promised. The runners, and waiter didn't have enough time to refill our water glasses. I ordered spaghetti, and didn't expect it to be \"el dente\". I don't like el dente. It should have at least stated that on the menu, unless by default higher end restaurants only serves el dente, then it's my fault for not knowing. I did my part to make it a perfect night for my girl friend and chose Lavo restaurant expecting them to do their part to keep it perfect.   I still didn't get my freakin bread after we almost finished our dinner. I see other tables received their bread before or with their entrees. For some, their bread basket might be late late, but at least the bread came for them LOL. Basically, everyone else got theirs. So what did I do? I asked for the bread, and got it 10 minutes later, after I had one bite left with my dinner. Instead of eating it, I just left it sitting there untouched. One of the runner guys asked if I wanted the bread to go, and I just dogged him. I wanted that waiter to know that he fucked up, he wasn't paying attention, and he should learn not to redirect blame to others who are not directly responsible for his table. And to make him and his food runners do the job that they're supposed to do and provide the complimentary bread as they should to all their patrons.  I wouldn't have mind if the waiter acknowledged his oversight. I would have dropped the whole bread ordeal. But he acted dumb, \"oh you didn't get it yet. But I told them to bring it out\". Yes, we didn't get it. Had you paid attention you would have noticed that a long time ago when you walked past our table a few times before our entrees came out.  I used to wait tables at a high end Japanese restaurant, and that line was complete BS.  Oh, the Chicken ravioli wasn't bad.  Nightclub: Sucked.  I should have stuck with my original plan to dine at Tao restaurant and attend Tao nightclub. But I've been there many times already and thus, I wanted to try out Lavo. Big Mistake.  However, the Palazzo is still one of my favorite hotels to stay at. I'll just never dine or attend Lavo Restaurant/Nightclub again.",

My friends and I opted for this route because our guy/girl ratio was not good. The restaurant is pricey, but their food portions are quite large and I thought the food was pretty good. The guys all got the prix fixe meal and there was too much food for everyone even though all the girls only got entrees. I had the sea bass and it was just the right amount of fish (I also had some of the calamari app, the kobe meatball, and tiramisu dessert). The Kardashian clan was there too and it wasn't all hectic with fans so we weren't bothered.   The club was alright, the music wasn't the greatest because I just don't care for house (and the dj kept yelling stuff like \"I can't hear you St. Tropez or Barcelona\"... it was really weird and random and he would turn OFF the music to yell stuff)... but when you don't pay cover and you want to get guys in a Vegas club, it was perfect. The club wasn't crazy crowded which I liked since I could dance on the dance floor (as opposed to a mosh pit), actually get drinks at the bar and use the restroom without a line.   I would consider going here again",

However, when we walked up they were very nice (yet strict) at the same time. We had a connection with a promoter to get in line, but once we got in line Justin, the guard at the front, had a great personality and was more then happy to have a conversation. That rarely happens to me in Vegas. Also while we were in line, two of our friends walked up and he let them join us so we didn't get separated. He was the reason I wanted to write this review (GO JUSTIN!)  Aside from the extremely nice staff, this brunch is an activity you HAVE to do when you plan a weekend in Vegas. There is so much activity and the DJs are awesome. If you're like me in vegas, you don't want to sleep all day or just have lunch at McDonalds... You want to have experience new things... and DRINK and NEVER sleep. 5 stars for giving me a crazy time before it even struck 5pm.",

So the DJ only plays each song for about 3 seconds and the light up foamies were giving me severe motion sickness (It felt like I was in a moving tunnel!), and if we forget about the whole projectile vomit incident, the night was a ton of fun.

    "text": "For a Tuesday night, I couldn't ask for better.  If bored on a Tuesday night, GO HERE.  I called in to be put on the guest list for 5 girls, but ended up going with a total of 4 girls.  Because of the good ratio, we were specially handed wristlets that got us free entry and open bar until 12am.  We noticed this special treatment when not everyone on the guest list had them.  Unfortunately, we got placed in the slower line, though I think that may be because only two of my friends were there when we approached the bouncer.  Regardless, we still got in, got our free drinks, and headed to the dance floor!  Wait time for my line was around 20-30 mins---just long.    The ambience of the club is similar to Tao, but Tao is a lot more decorative.  Walking through the line of sinks is indeed something that regular clubs don't have.  Being that it was a Tuesday night, it wasn't too too crowded, so we had enough space on the dance floor to move around.  Similar to Tao, don't be expecting seats to rest your feet in, but honestly, we danced for two hours straight.  Had we not needed up get up at 7:30 to catch the ride home, I would've stayed until at least 3 am.  Also, as with Tao, there were foam bubbles that sprayed onto the dace floor.  What makes or breaks a club for me in the music---LAVO nailed this!  Dj scratchy was an excellent dj, playing a good mixture of songs that I mostly knew.  Apparently, according to my friends they had switched the dj when within the first few minutes we were at the dance floor, but honestly, I didn't notice.  The smooth transition and same good music was playing, so it pretty much made my night.  The negatives- no seats, couldn't find a bathroom (though we didn't try very hard to begin with), and oh yeah, we had a little too much fun.  For a couple of my friends, it was their first time clubbing, so we had a blast.  But if i were to choose one between Tao and Lavo, I would still choose Tao.  Where's the flying girl in the air and the bubbles, the girls washing in the bathtub, the extra sofas that girls are just lying in?  Overall though, for a Tuesday night, this is where the party is!",

Dinner was amazing, service was excellent, food was great, we sat on the patio which wasn't too hot even for July weather. Just really really good experience...  then we went upstairs, the club was mehhh, we got free drink tickets and got to get weird drunk men touching our hair and walking up out of nowhere to try and kiss us, gross. The nightclub obviously can't control their patrons oddness but the club itself was underwhelming, we only stayed for one drink then left... but I would really reccommend the restuarant!",

    "text": "This review is for the \"nightclub\" portion of Lavo, as we did not eat here...   I despise the lines, the douchebaggeriness, and the crowds of all clubs in Vegas in general, as I'm the kind of guy who actually likes to dance when I go to a club. But Lavo makes everything significantly worse. Except the lines, because nobody wants to go here. Neither did we, but some of the girls wanted to dance and nobody wanted to venture out into the freezing blizzard outdoors to get to a better club. Alas, we walked over from our room at the Venetian and decided to check this place out.   The first thing you'll notice is that this place is tiny. I mean TINY.  The second thing you'll notice is that it is ridiculously crowded. Let's make this very clear: you will NOT be doing any dancing here. If you're one of those creepers who considers \"bouncing up and down while trying to grab a little bit of anything else bouncing up and down\" dancing, then you might have a good time. If you've got any real moves, you'll be really sad because you'll never get to use them. And I'm freakin' fabulous, so I've got some serious moves.  The third thing you'll notice is that it's hot as all hell because of all the disgusting people packed in like a can of sardines. I'm not a stickler for rules, but Lavo managed to actually make me say (and this is the lamest thing somebody could EVER say at a club): \"Dude, we need to get a fire marshal in here...\" And I meant it. I don't think I've ever thought that in any other situation in my life. Ever.   I might be able to comment on more things about Lavo had I decided to stick around, but I did one walk around and decided I'm out. Save your effort and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "This is my 6th time here and came with my family and fiance on our Vegas trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. Called a few weeks in advance to book a table, they ask you for a credit card to secure your reservation so be aware of that. Requested a table outside and mentioned it was my daddy's 60th birthday. We waited about 30 mins for the table (totally normal at this restaurant) for a table for 6 outside. They said they could seat us immediately inside but it was such a  gorgeous night we waited. We grabbed some drinks at the bar and yummy long bread sticks and stood outside and waited. Once our buzzer rang we were seated at a great table with a view of the pirate show at TI. We ate late, around 11pm so we saw the last show of the night. Quite loud so be prepared. The restaurant is one of the loudest restaurants (inside) in Vegas - super fun. The food here is AMAZING! SO TASTY! To start we ordered: Sun Ripened Tomato Bufala Mozzarella $19 2 orders of the Eggplant Parmigiano (the server even warned us that they are huge but I told him we usually order 1 for my fiance and me when we come, they are THAT good!) YOU MUST ORDER THIS $17 Crispy Fried Calamari $17 Meatball with fresh whipped ricotta $21 The men had beers and the ladies split this AMAZING white pinot grigio, I can't rem the name but it was so tasty and the price was really good! For the mains we ordered: Organic Mixed Green Salad $16  Mixed Wild Mushrooms $11 Chicken Parmigiano $29 (comes with a large side of pasta) Four Cheese Ravioli $24 Chicken & Mushroom Ravioli $27 Spinach & Artichoke Brick Oven Pizza $21  Everything was amazing. The only reason I am removing 1 star is because I reminded both the hostess and the server that it was my father's 60th birthday and NOTHING was done. Not even a little candle. They must have forgotten, but I was quite disappointed with that part.  Will return for the tasty food and environment.",

    "text": "4 stars for the nightclub.  In March 2013, I traveled to Vegas with my sister and one of her friends for a girls weekend in Vegas. They had never done table service at a nightclub before, so I decided to be generous and spring for a table on the Saturday night we would be there. I decided on LAVO because the host, Matthew Goodman, was incredibly responsive. Literally within 10 minutes of sending my inquiry email, I had texts from Matt to help set up my reservation (this was opposed to some other clubs that either never responded or took days to respond). He also offered to get us into the brunch, but we decided against it as we wanted to do other things during the day.   The entrance to the nightclub is on the side and not a far walk from the door that the taxis drop you off at. There was no wait to check in (we arrived around 11 pm) and Matt walked us to our table. Throughout the night he checked on us a few times which I thought was great customer service. Our cocktail server at the table was totally on point, and we were never without drinks. I managed to get us a free bottle of champagne which we had first before moving on to the Ketel One vodka bottle I bought.  The negative about table service at LAVO is that while we had a table right off the dance floor (I cannot complain about the location) is that we were squished in between two other tables with groups. When you get a table, you are expecting to get space to spread out and relax. We were kind of on top of each other which is the reason I give the nightclub 4 stars. But if you want a table, I highly recommend getting ahold of Matt. He is the best host I have worked with in Vegas.",

Definition wise, it should be considered a Ultra Lounge instead. Very small dance floor, but it does attract a more laid back crowd than Tao.   If you are not into Asians, don't come to Lavo or Tao. Because I am definitely not attracted to Asians, and in both my experiences here and Tao, damn Asians are fucking everywhere around me.   Be sure to come over early, because the lines do extend past the front doors of the Palazzo casino at around 10:45.",

There's still music being played I'm sure, but just don't expect it to be a night out full of visual effects, big DJS, dance floor...etc.  Restaurant-wise.....food was delicious. They gave us a basket of garlic bread to start off with. First batch is complimentary. Waiter was attentive throughout the night. Keep topping off our drinks.  For entrees, I ordered: Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato ($31) -Seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, garlic butter. I've never been a fan of seafood but WOW! This was flavorful,  fresh and cooked to perfection. The salmon with the buttery sauce just melts in your mouth. My boyfriend ordered: Grilled Tuna with Roasted Artichokes ($36) -Yellow fin tuna, oven roasted tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette. We both enjoyed our dinner very much....plus that complimentary dessert platter with cheesecake brulee and fried oreos dipped in melted vanilla ice cream was just the icing on the cake to our fabulous dinner date.  =)  One thing I do have to mention, the restaurant MAY be a bit dark and loud to some people. (Fobby Asian parents come to mind. LOL) But this restaurant is a definite repeat. I know there are plenty of other Italian restaurants here at The Venetian or Palazzo...or even Las Vegas in general, but I would rank LAVO over Dal Toro or B & B Restaurante.",

As soon as we sat the server greeted us and it was quite obvious on his face that he knew we were young which, in this industry equals no money but little did he know WE HAVE MONEY.   That is all the negative I need to say, the servers need to treat every guests like they are VIP because they really just do not know.   BUT the food tastes amazing, every single thing we ordered came out perfect and the bussers did a fantastic job at making sure we always had water and clean plates. So overall thanks LAVO but tell your servers they need a personality check or something of that sort. Cheers!",

I ordered a Grey Goose and soda with a lime. It was just what I needed as it felt great on my sore throat. They brought over their homemade garlic bread which was pretty tasty.   We decided on the oysters for an appetizers, which were also pretty tasty!  We also ordered the wedge salad which was last nice and crisp and very tasty!!! You could actually share this salad.  For dinner, my cousin and I ordered the Chilean sea bass on a bed of heirloom tomatoes with a vinaigrette. My husband had the pasta scampi which I tried and thought it was pretty tasty too.  I almost forgot I ordered a side of Brussels sprouts, pancetta and Parmesan cheese.  Our friends also ordered their well known meatball. I tried a small bite, and I have to say it was de-O-licious!!!   Since I checked in on Yelp I got a free dessert of fried Oreos with ice cream for our table. You can never go wrong with fried anything, so it was the perfect touch to finish off dinner. Since it was my cousins birthday they gave him a very nice dessert in the house.  The service was great, and she had no problem splitting the checks up.",

What was ordered -lobster pasta -chicken parm - Caesar salad - lobster bisque - penne pasta - cocktail - meat and cheese platter (only thing worthwhile IMO) - a beer  - water  Total price - $197.50  Here's what irked me about the place.  First off we had a reservation for a large party.  They seemed to cram about 12 of us in a table for 8 and we didn't even get to sit with the rest of our party. Next when ordering food the waiter failed to mention that our $28 and $26 entrees did not come with anything else.  So when asking if I wanted that side of pasta wasn't aware that it was more.  We can boil that down to being uninformed.  But the one thing you can't fake is the taste of the food.  Quite frankly I have had better chicken parm at Olive Garden.  What ever red sauce they use lacks some serious flavor.  They apparently charge for water of which I didn't drink any but yet somehow this water cost more than the beer did.  Not sure how to explain that.   The icing on the cake for me however is that the waiter did not split the check.  So all of the food for both tables came on one check.  When asked if he would split it he basically said we needed to figure it out.  What? His excuse was that he was not told to do it beforehand so he couldn't now.  Fortunately the other waiter at the other table agrees to split it so now our waiter is forced to do so as well.  I can't say I would ever return here",

Again, these complaints are in regards to the expected  standard of a finer dining restaurant.

    "text": "Had dinner here last Friday night.  We made reservations ahead of time through Open Table which I highly recommend.  When we arrived for our 9:30pm dinner they were running a little behind so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  Great service from the bartender.  Dinner was very good.  We dined on the patio and had the Calamari and Meatball for the appetizers.  Literally the best calamari I've ever had and a pretty darn good meatball too.  For the entree I had the Chicken Parm which was outstanding.  I wish I had been more hungry because it was outstanding.    The only reason I'm not giving this experience 5 stars is the way the payment was handled.  Our server brought over the check and when I gave him my credit card he insisted that I had to select either a 20 or 22% gratuity option and sign the original check on the spot before he ran the card.  I've never seen this before and it may be how they handle things at this restaurant but it struck me as odd and very awkward.  I had planned to give him a 20% tip but what if I hadn't planned to.  Weird....",

The price range was moderate so nothing crazy. This will definitely be a place like pop in when I am in town again.",

Nice menu selection and drinks!   Again, price point is high... but if you go in knowing that, all good! Great option in the Palazzo for an upscale meal!",

And when we asked to have them heated up they looked bothered about it like if we were annoying them. Then we ordered a fruit salad for desert - 40 minutes later it was still not here and the waitress didn't even apologize for it when we asked why it wasn't here it. She answered in a really disrespectful way and turned her back on us.  We were so disappointed about our experience and would not go back. We expected so much more as we are used to go to Lavo in New York City which has the best service.   This Lavo in Las Vegas - WORST SERVICE",

Our server was a tall Asian woman and very nice.  Of course my friend Dave couldn't stop staring.  She could be a super model!  Ordered a Jameson ginger and it was good pour.  Steve and Tom ordered food for the table, and while the other night we were on the hunt for the infamous $1.99 shrimp cocktail on Fremont Street, there was a shrimp cocktail on the menu, so Dave and I ordered it.  Imagine our surprise....  Dave: Excuse me, we ordered two Other server: Yes, that's two...it's by the piece  Holey Shmoley!  Shrimp cocktail....singular....$8 for a single shrimp...and not a prawn or a tiger shrimp....LOL!  The Wedge salad was ok as was the Caesar...but for those prices, I expected something spectacular!  Or maybe gold plated China to eat off of...LOL!  The best thing was the Baked Clams Oreganato...very good flavor!  I also thought the bread was premade and was just in a warmer to be grabbed and set on a plate.    The ambiance is very nice!  The story behind the faucets above was interesting, and the deejay played some great tunes from the past and present.  However, there wasn't that \"WOW\" factor with the food which is a shame, considering how beautiful the hotel is.  If it wasn't for our server, I probably would've given two stars.",

I showed up at Lavo with the intention of getting 2 desserts to go. The front staff kindly pointed me to the bar to order and wait.   I ordered the 7 layer rolled chocolate cake and the peanut butter cake. The bartenders were super friendly and did their best to make my wait as enjoyable as possible. I did expect them to be faster, since I only ordered dessert, but once they brought out the dessert, I understood what took so long. The peanut butter cake is so large that thy had to get creative and wrap it in a pizza box.  The decor at Lavo is beautiful. I would definitely recommend Lavo for a drink or a date. Before the club gets started, this is a quiet and relaxing place to be.  As for the cake, it's amazing. Both were really great. You need to really, really enjoy peanut butter to love that cake. It's super filling and rich. It's a dessert to share. I preferred it to the rolled cake, but I love peanut butter. The rolled cake is like a ho-ho only bigger and denser. Overall, I would get both again. The prices are also super reasonable for the size. I highly recommend dessert here.  P.S. I've had the Oreo zeppoles in the past. These are awesome, as well.",

We also ordered the seafood tower which was quite delicious.    I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a side of broccoli.   I have to tell you, it was truly one of the best prepared, beautifully presented pieces of fish I have enjoyed in a long time.

By a lot i just mean good food, filling, great service and a fair price.   Well, this place checked off all the marks. The service wasnt rushed, they gave us comp antipasta dish which was nice, but one of the three items was hummus and there was nothing to eat the hummus or salumi with. LoL. You just have to roll with the punches at some of these thought processes.   We ordered the salmon which was phenemonal. It came with a bread crust and just tasted divine. Other person got the spaghetti and meatballs. I know ground breaking night but lets be honest Italian food doesnt really break the mold. Its either done well or not and thats all you can judge this cuisine on.   We ended up getting strawberry shortcake for dessert and it wasnt my fave. I suppose shortcake is suppose to be dry, but my goodness its okay to use a little butter and sugar on dessert. I rarely go for Italian desserts anyway but at least we tried.  I overlooked the beginning and end mostly because service and entrees were stellar. Id for sure go back.",

For drinks, I ordered a Raspberry Cucumber Spritz, which consisted of fresh raspberries, cucumber, club soda, mint oil, and agave nectar served over ice. It was bubbly and tart. Another guest in my party ordered the Cranberry Spiced Mojito, which consisted of fresh orange juice, agave nectar, mint oil, cold pressed lime juice, cranberry juice, and sliced cane sugar served over ice. It was fruity and refreshing.   Shortly after, our server brought us an Antipasto Plate with three compartments - salami & olives, hummus, and pickled vegetables (cauliflower, tomato, celery, and radish).   For appetizers, we shared The Meatball, which consisted of a pound of fresh ground imperial Waygu, Italian sausage, and veal rolled into a ball and baked in a marinara sauce topped with fresh whipped ricotta and herbs. It was probably the most delicious meatball I've had in awhile. I liked how they sliced it for us.  For dinner, my mom ordered the Roasted Beets Salad, which was tossed with mixed greens and toasted almonds in sun dried tomato vinaigrette. My dad ordered the Branzino, which consisted of whole fish served with a panzanella salad tossed in extra virgin olive oil and capers. My aunt and uncle shared the Chicken Parmigiano, which consisted of thinly pounded chicken topped with mozzarella and fresh herbs and served in marinara sauce. I ordered the Grilled Yellow Fin Tuna, which was cooked to medium rare and served over slightly spiced roasted tomatoes, asparagus, and artichokes in a lemon vinaigrette. Everything was delicious in their own way. I requested my dish to be pepper free due to an allergy but I found a whole chili pepper (with the ends cut off) in my vegetables. We ordered a side of  Creamed Spinach to go with our meal.  For checking into LAVO on Yelp, they gave us an order of Oreo Zeppole, which consisted of six deep fried Oreos served with vanilla ice cream and oreo crumbles. Since we were on a tight timeline, they allowed us to return after the show to redeem the treats.",

Oysters were terrific as was the grilled octopus appetizer. Pasta, fish and seafood Alfredo were all hits at our table. Service was competent and friendly. Decent wine selections. Reasonably priced. Overall, the meal was very good but did especially distinguish itself from all the formidable competitors at the Venetian/Palazzo.",

    "text": "STAY AWAY: This was quite simply the WORST meal I've ever had in Las Vegas, end of story. I ordered the pasta with seafood in what was supposed to be a spicy tomato sauce.  The seafood was OK but the pasta was virtually raw (I sent it back and the second coming was only marginally better) and the \"sauce\" might as well have come from a can of crushed tomatoes.  When I complained to the server I was told the kitchen prepares it \"al dente\" and did I understand what that meant?  Please - I'm a freakin' chef!  This linguini literally sat on my fork PARALLEL to the plate!  To add insult to injury, the whole mess took more than two hours with some of the most indifferent service I've ever had, and for a princely sum.  Maybe the Vegas glitterati see something I don't (starting with the head-pounding noise and the nausea-inducing lack of lighting) but with all the other options in Las Vegas, this one deserves to close IMMEDIATELY.",

She is an amazing dancer, and whenever she danced, people would totally just stop and stare. When I was washing my hands in the bathroom, she was right next to me freshening up, and I just had to say hi. Totally expecting her to be snobby, she wasn't! And when I complimented her on her dancing, she was so humble about it!   2. The day before, we'd run into a promotor named Jesse at Tao who promised us VIP table service, and he definitely did not disappoint. My girls and I were SPOILED, and Jesse took care of us pretty much the whole night. We felt like celebrities.  My favorite part: Meeting the Canadian restaurant owner who wasn't too handsy, good dancer, sweet, AND when googled the next morning, was actually a Canadian restaurant owner. (He also told me he was a professional snowboarder. Yup, he wasn't that.)",

When we expressed our concern about the steak, the waitress got out her flashlight to examine it and discovered how overdone it was. She said she was going to tell the manager, however, no one came by our table. This was our worst experience by far for dining in Vegas!",

I only come here because we met this chick at Caesar's that promotes it and Tao. The last 2 times that I went, they have open bar so of course I was ecstatic! I mean, I had a great time for free although the type of alcohol you can get is limited. The music is OK....with the occasional old school ones where people leave and disperse from the dancefloor. Their go-go dancers are pretty hot and they have girls that bathe each other by the bar or something like that. Oh! And sometimes you'll see a midget slave walking around chained up to his fat lady master...hahaha! I swear!",

They were severely lacking in flavor. Next was the Chicken Parm. I was expecting something along the lines of the best Chicken Parm I've ever had for $26, but it was no better than the $10 special at my local pizza shop. Way too much cheese and way too little sauce. At least the gelato for dessert was good.  The highlight of the meal was probably the excellent bread with marinara sauce that was served shortly after I sat down at the table.  Wait staff was excellent and attentive. Clientele was all over the age spectrum. My older neighbors at the adjacent tables were friendly and talkative.  I was offered a hand-stamp for some kind of VIP entry to the club that night, but declined as I am not really into the whole  \"wait in a line for an hour to pay $20 for the privledge of entering a sardine can to buy $15 drinks\" thing.",

My bf and I were given 2 VIP passes by a group of girls who work for LAVO when we were shopping around. They spotted us from far and waved their hands. I looked at my bf and said \"oh, do I know them? But they are cute! \" . So the girls came up to us and one of them said \"u both look so cute together, and I loveeee your dress\". I don't normally like being stopped in the middle of my shopping immediately cut her off and said do u want to sell something? She said oh no, we want to invite you guys to LAVO and TAO tonight, we want to give you these VIPS passes so you guys can go in just fine, no need to line up. I said what's the catch? She said nothing, just show up, we love beautiful people in there. We were like ok, if we can make it because we have a show to watch. But we indeed made it. =)   LAVO was crowded, the line was looonnggggggggg but we did not have to line up for hours like the rest of them, club goers. They were there since 8.30 pm!! Noone questioned us, nothing. The bouncer treated us like VIP =) He walked us in. LMAO. I mean, I never had to line up anywhere because I don't like it. I wont go to a club unless it's a VIP pass or a bottle service. I don't care how fancy the club is, I am not the type that go ga-ga over some stupid clubs. I love dancing and loud music, no doubt, but to wait in line? NO WAY! OK, back to LAVO. All the tables were booked. I, like the rest of the crowds had to line up to get some drinks. It took us about 15 -20 mins to get some. And they were expensive!! We spent about 50 on 2 small drinks, and another 25 on some stupid shots and I did not even taste the alcohol in it. Then we went to the dancing floor, and it was packed! Cant even move around much but heck, we enjoyed the night. We stayed till 1.30 am because we were tired. When we walked out, there was still a long line to get in. Wow.  It's a small club really, don't think they can fit more than 300 people? I don't know but downstairs is a bar/lounge area. So who ever needs some fresh air, away from the crowds and dance a bit, they can go there!",

    "text": "\"A Better Experience in Vegas\"  I love how the line is worked out.  They stick everyone into one line unless there is bottle service.  No pushing need to get to the front of the line to get in.  Didn't need to tip or anything either.    My night - Drank about 10 shots in line in 5 minutes waiting for me to get in.  I was surprised on how well I did and didn't start throwing up everywhere.  But I met some nice people in line and decided to give them some since I couldn't finish a 1.75 liter bottle to myself.  I took about a quarter of the bottle.  Then took some and mixed it with the rest of the pomegranate juice I had left.  Just kept sipping on it with the ladies in front of me.  Random girls and random nights.  This save me over 200 bucks.  I'm really surprised that the bouncers didn't really care while waiting in line.  That was a really really big plus.  They saw me, and they still let me in.  Now lets get to the people - Wow... I might have paid to get in, but I barely spent any money on drinks.  I just made my rounds dancing with random people... Not sure how this started to happen, but random girls just started pouring me shots.  Which was nice.  I guess they liked my costume, since it was for Halloween.  But yes, this one girl in particular, just kept poor me drinks.  The guys in there group weren't dancing so I pulled one guy to the side and was like, it's Vegas... Just dance, they won't mind it.  I think they would prefer someone they know than a random guy like me to dance with them.  The guy started to dance, the girl danced back.  Yes, success!  Then I just simply started dancing with the other girls.  I'm not sure, but the thing that probably broke the ice was my costume.  They had a batman and robin outfit, and I had the (Joker - Nurse scene outfit on).  They the guys wanted to take pictures with me, then it happened.  Then the girls and me just started dancing.  I left to go look for my friends...  I didn't find them and this random girl comes up to me and was like what would you like to drink.  It's on me, I offered to pay, but her response was, this will probably be the only drink that a girl will buy you tonight... Which was probably True...  So I took the offer, and she gave me her number... I love Canadians!  They are so friendly...  Then I went to go dance some more... I love dancing!  This is where the stupid asses come in.  I was randomly dancing, then I started to dance with this Japanese chick...  A random ass dude comes up and pushes me.  I let it slide.  Then I went to go dance with the girl again, he comes out of no where and pushes me again!  I went to go talk to the girl about it...  She told me that was one of her friends and tried to convince me to not to beat his ass... The her other friends saw and they came and talked to me, and said that he was one of those rich white boys that daddy will take care of him if anything happens.  I waited for him outside to get an explanation for the shove.  The girl didn't want anything to happen.  So she told her friend to leave and watch out for me.  Which did happen, because I didn't see him anytime after that... But I just wanted an explanation.  After that incident, it just killed my night... From being filled with alcohol to being filled with adrenalin!  It basically took my mood away to dance...  I didn't mind confronting him about the pushes(these were not lite shoves, these were shoves causing me to take a few steps back so I wouldn't fall)...  That's what got me so angry.  I wanted to confront him, but security said it wasn't a good idea since his friends calling him stupid and drunk, he would probably do something stupid...  So I decided to leave.  STUPID STUPID PEOPLE!  I swear!  People go out to have fun and stupid people like that kill the mood for everyone!  But other than those 20 minutes... Everything was fantastic!",

    "text": "This was the first place we started the evening after having some wine and appetizers @ Palm by Ceasar's Forum Shops.  We had gone to our room to freshen up and then came back downstairs to hit up LAVO. We got a line pass and free drinks for me and my friends because we were guests at the hotel.  We got here shortly after 1am and there was still a little line outside the place on a Friday night. The music was just OK but the place was extremely packed! We managed to make our way to one of the bars to get our drinks and then head to the dance floor.  OMG, it was like a can of sardines.  There were a lot of drunk girls on the floor and one or two jumped up on the gogo stage to rock it like they got it like that.  LOL...  So we thought we'd check out the other dance floor. It was crowded too (boooo....) and tough to get through that crowd.  There were some big people and I am small and petite so I wasn't feeling it.  We took a few pix and danced for a little bit and then we left to go checkout the outdoors patio.  The patio was nice and lots of places to sit out there.  It was cool outside, not too hot or cold so we took a nice breather and met a couple guys from Boston.  It was nice because it wasn't converted to a bottle service area so you could sit at the tables and comfortably chat with others hanging out there.  It was almost 4am so we decided to go hit another club. I thought this club rated a 3 overall but I give it 4 stars for the patio, the energy in the crowd and the free drinks/pass.",

Spaghetti with Kobe beef meatballs for entree... the best meatballs I've ever had. The table shared a warm banana and chocolate pudding and a strawberry ricotta cheesecake... both of which were incredible. Service was extremely slow, especially the long waits for dishes to be cleared and for the payment to be processed. But it's Vegas and I was relaxed so not a huge deal. Would absolutely dine there again, and without question I would order any dish that featured Lavo's meatballs.",

Us being chinamen, we couldn't pass up a deal, even if we didn't want to drink anymore (and i think they knew that).  Sale on vodka in vegas?   who can pass on that?  that shit never happens!  we ended up drinking about 3/4 of one bottle.  but again, we're chinamen so we couldn't let the rest go to waste, especially if we paid for it.  we bought a few bottled waters, downed them and emptied the leftover Geese into the water bottles under the table to save for a rainy day.      NOTE: the two-for-one isn't probably going to be offered on a good, busy night.  it was dead when we went so they were probably trying to make as much money as they could off of us...bastards.",

While we were having a decent time and there was this one bouncer who was the smallest one of all with a bald head who had a hard on for one of my friends, decided my buddy had his shirt unbuttoned one button to many and by the way he had a shirt under a shirt. Well while we were having fun the runt came over with 4 of his cronies and tossed my friend out the back door with know warning at all.  Thank god for texting other wise I wouldn't have any clue where my buddy was. I just feel after spending $800 dollars at the time we should have had a chance to make it right but that J--- off fucking ruined the night for us . Never in my life would I think a good customer would be treated that way unless he was trouble. I wonder if a girls dress was to short or her top was to low would she go thru the same ( I don't  think so ) so to the man in charge you should take a good look at your staff and polish them up and get rid of that runt of the litter.",

My good friend was able to comp us for practically everything that night, all we had to do was tip. We had a huge dinner; not even 7 girls could finish the amount of food that they brought us.  There were several starters and several main dishes. The salads were great, really fresh ingredients. Some of the entrees were a little questionable. The chicken cordon bleu was salty, but the flat bread pizza was really tasty.  We had drinks during dinner and upstairs in the club. The service for dinner was okay, it was pretty packed on a Sunday night. The dj that was playing in dining area was playing some good music, the dj upstairs played okay music, mostly radio stuff.   Another plus was that we didn't have to wait line, we were escorted in. As soon as we got upstairs we were given more drinks... wOOh! The place was going crazy, people dancing all over the place on top of anything and everything. And for some reason two guys dressed up as Mario and Luigi started dancing, with the Mario game music as background... really random, but funny. However the biggest con is that the place is small and that Sunday was just crazy; I could barely move it was so packed. It seemed like everybody was out that night. Other than that, its a pretty good place to start your night off!",

    "text": "First let me start off by saying this review is SOLEY just for the restaurant, NOT the club. I absolutely LOVE Lavo Nightclub and it's staff.   That being said, let me start my review with my first encounter with the restaurant, it's hostess BRITNEY. It's disappointing to me that such a 5 star restaurant would employ such a 1 star hostess. She has EXTREMELY poor phone etiquette, unknowledgeable about the menu and restaurant, and at one point during our conversation was giving me attitude! Ive worked in the restaurant & food business for 7 years, and know the importance of the Host, being the first person the customer encounters, and I beg of TROY MORGAN to PLEASE consider getting rid of, or re-training your front host staff, so she could be more than just a pretty face!  Moving on, as many of the other reviews stated, the restaurant and club are literally on top of each other, so there no separating the music or loud crowd..so if youre looking for a nice quiet dinner, try some where else. Food was \"meh\" ...Ive had better italian @ Sinatras in the Wynn. However some of the other guest in my party really enjoyed it. However, once again, I had already had a bad taste in my mouth from my first encounter with the hostess, so maybe that had something to do with it.",

    "text": "We had dinner here for a bachelorette party.  I have mixed feeling about the restaurant part.  Since we had such a big group, we had to do a set dinner menu.  The price per person for the menu was about $100.  For the food we got, it was not worth the price.  BUT in Lavo's defense, we picked the food.  So I guess I'd like to go back and try something off of their regular menu.  For what we did have:  Mussles in marinara sauce, the sauce was good, but over  1/2 of the mussels were not cooked all the way and did not open.  Garlic break and marinara sauce - the flavor was there but the presentation was an F.  They brought out a plate with a bowl of marinara sauce and a loaf of garlic bread wrapped in tin foil.  They put it on the table and I was confused.  Also, there was no serving pieces for the sauce or bread.  In a restaurant like this you'd think the presentation would be looked after a bit more.  The flat bread was yummy, served on a baking stone so that was fine.  The dinner (again this was partially not fabulous but only bc of what was choosen by our group): 2 pastas, French fries, mashed potatoes, broccoli.  What a strange combo, but all I can do is rate each item on its own.  The pastas were cooked al dente and the sauce had a great flavor.  I like al dente so it didn't bother me, but some girls didn't like it.  The starches were good - but how can you mess up fries or mashed potatoes.  The broccoli was steamed - that's about all I can say about that, it's broccoli so how can you really say any more? The service was outstanding - our waiter was super friendly and funny (and cute!) and he kept the wine flowing.  I'd definitely give Lavo another try, just because I don't think I got the full experience with our personal tasting menu.  On a plus, they put a personalized menu out for us with our bachelorette's name and the date - a nice keepsake.  I enjoyed the ambiance - it was super upbeat, chic and trendy.  The music was hip hop and everyone was just dancing in their seats having a good time at dinner.  For now I will give Lavo a 3, but I have a feeling it is just because I was there for a event that required a set menu and I was thrown off by the garlic bread wrapped in tin foil, LOL.  If I return,  hopefully I can give it a 4 or 5.    The club - great music, EXTREMELY crowded, but drink and shot prices weren't terrible.  The dance pit was insanely crowded. I think if you had VIP or table service you would have the roped off area that surrounds the dance floor.  I don't know if that is a good thing though bc the dance floor was so crowded I would feel trapped at your table.  I heard from a waitress that we met at Tryst that the night club is notorious for having extremely long lines.  The club was a bit on the smaller side (compared to places like Tryst, Jet, Pure, Moon).  For the club, I'd give it a 2 just for the reason that there are so many other fab clubs in Vegas.",

There wasn't the long line that you find at Tao, and the bouncer was not nearly as pretentious.  The decor inside was beautiful, classic Italian style.  The crowd was very cool as well.  They had models that stood in a classic style bathtub and washed themselves which I had never seen before, so even if you are bored there's something to watch.  :-)",

While the meatball was good, it was not the most amazing meatball I have ever had.  Maybe with the price point and advertisement of Wagyu beef I had too large of an expectation.  Again it was good, but nothing over the top.  Some of my group opted for salads as well and they all seemed fresh and larger portions.  I ordered the Truffle Gnocchi and did not want to fill up on salad before the meal.  When the food came out it was hot and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.  I could have used a little more truffle flavor, but there was still good flavor.   For drinks, I opted to try the cucumber mojito, which was delicious even though I was a bit confused.  Mojitos are made with rum and this option was made with vodka.  Vodka is my preference so this was fine with me and the drink was fantastic.  Our server was fantastic.  She would stop by to check on us often, but not where it became a burden.  My water glass did run empty once or twice, but promptly filled up once flagged down someone.  It was a good experience at Lavo and would come back when I was in town.",

The sea bass was amazing. It was fresh and did not have any fishy smell. Smooth and soft would describe this goodness. It was my favorite dish.   Everyone says to get the meatball here and they were not wrong.  A mix of wagyu, Italian sausage and veal, it was the size of a tennis ball with marinara sauce. Very good texture and flavor.   Anything deep fried can easily win me over. The calamari was done well. It's pretty hard to mess us though.   I also liked the New York strip. It was cooked to perfection and delicious.   Dinner was definitely good.  Expect to pay a premium.",

I made a note on our reservation that we were there for our anniversary and we were congratulated by all the staff who spoke to us.  The ambience is very sexy. Dim lighting, corner bench seats to sit close, and an excellent DJ. I wanted her mixes. As for the food, it was delicious. We ordered the clam appetizer, I had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and broccoli and my husband had the seafood alfredo. For dessert, we were given a complementary tiramisu that was nice and light. We truly enjoyed our meals. It can be pricey once you start ordering courses, but it was well worth it.",

Long story Short- There were at least 30 tables that night and there were only TWO servers. My guests and I were regularly ignored by the waiter and when I spoke to management they were absolutely no help at all. I do not blame the waiter for this, I blame management. The waiter kindly let us know that he was running around like a chicken with their head cut off trying to keep up because the manager had sent all the other waiters and waitresses home thinking it would be a slow night.  I have literally never even received service this poor from Applebee's, let alone a \"high end\" restaurant. We ended up spending well over 2 hours at Lavo for 4 drinks and 3 meals. What. A. Joke.   AVOID at all costs and indulge in one of the several True high end restaurants at your disposal.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for our honeymoon, and since we were staying at the Palazzo, we decided to have a nice dinner here. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful, and it has a fancy, romantic ambiance. Our waiter brought a drink menu and asked what we would like for beverages. We had been sipping drinks ALL day at the pool, so we actually didn't feel like wine or anything, so we said no thank you. His eyes almost popped out of his head. Two adults, at an expensive Italian restaurant, NOT ordering wine at dinner?? He really looked like he had a problem with it. He unhappily brought over two waters and gave us the dinner menu. We ordered ravioli and a flatbread pizza. The food was so delicious! After we were done, he handed me a dessert menu and said \"I'm assuming you're not having dessert either?\". Since pasta and pizza are filling (hello carbs!) we said no thank you to dessert. He snatched the dessert menu out of my hand and stomped away. I could not believe his childish behavior. It's like the meal wasn't going to be expensive enough for his liking to get a big enough tip. When the bill came, my husband put some cash down and asked for a $50 bill back. The waiter took a $50 bill out of his pouch, but then stopped and looked at the bill again, and said \"Um, how about I give you back two $20's and a $10 instead?\". I knew right away he was asking because he wanted the $20 (at least) left for him as a tip, as we were likely to pocket the $50 bill. To say we were unimpressed with his service and attitude would be a severe understatement.   5 stars for food, 0 stars for service...averages out to about 3 stars I guess.",

    "text": "A special family event sometimes calls for some special Italian cooking and fancy cocktails. LAVO delivered a friendly, professional and fun vibe along with some pretty impressive food to back up the high end decor and price tag.  The Wagyu meatball was a phenomenal appetizer. Enough fat content to be decadent, wonderfully cooked, a flavorful tomato sauce and just a little too much cheese (no such thing really). It makes me wonder how that spaghetti and meatball entree would be!   I went with the Chilean sea bass as my main course. It was seared beautifully. I soon realized that the knife was unnecessary. The crispy fried Portabella mushrooms were an interesting and unusual pairing in the plate as I expected a meaty fish and meaty mushroom to get in the way of each other. No worries though! The mushrooms were thinly sliced and crispy as advertised. I wouldn't have wanted a chunk. The tomatoes also provided a bit of lightness, freshness and acid to the dish. Spot on.  Value for money is reasonable considering the location. LAVO was worth a visit and likely worth another.",

    "text": "Reviewing on Sunday Brunch as these are the only times I've visited LAVO.  Time to review up after the 4th and BEST visit this year. (so far)  I visited on a Sunday at 11 AM without reservations catching up with my favorite flexitarian yelper. <a href=\"https://adaywithdiana.yelp.com/\">adaywithdiana.yelp.com</a>  =)  Service: 5/5 We were seated immediately on a Sunday at 11 AMish without a reservation by the friendly hostesses at the front. Erich R (name from check) was fantastic and provided the best brunch experience I've had so far this year.  He was witty and kept the mimosa glasses filled all morning.  I was taking it easy, so I only had about 6 but Erich kept checking on us and making us laugh.  One of the managers in a suit also stopped by to check on us.  At the end, Erich gave us a bonus mimosa in a to go cup without us asking, that's what I'm talking about.  Food: 4.5/5  Here's my current brunch faves: \"Back to School\": Truffled Grilled Cheese, Applewood Bacon with Calabrian tomato soup on the side.  Wow, sounds so simple but was so bomb .Everything compliments each other so well.    If I tried making this simple sandwich at home with ingredients from my local Smith's, disaster af.. When you use high quality ingredients and prep it perfectly, you get next level stuff.    Chicken & Waffles: Cliche foodie breakfast dish, but once again, ingredients and preparation. Chocolate Chip Pancakes:  I always share these and it's a win win for everyone. What's odd to me is that most of the portions are on the smaller side, but I always end up getting full very quickly.    Value: 5/5  Considering you're in a beautiful high end restaurant, at a premium resort on the Las Vegas strip, the average dish was $13-$17 which is fair imo.  $30 gets you bottomless options of: Mimosas, Kir Royales and Rose Sangrias.  The consistent top notch service is what really brings the value home for me.  When you leave a brunch in a better mood before walking in (and I'm happy af in general) that's great value.  Hold onto it, and don't let it go....  Ambiance: 5/5  Attractiveness at every point of contact.  The hostesses, the bar, the tables, the decorations, the server uniforms, the bathroom with the huge well sinks, etc  Very high end classy but yet inviting vibe.  No douche vibe in such a lovely high end establishment...  Lavo is 4 for 4 this year for brunches.  Food is always on point and the service has always been top notch.  This is one of the few high end restaurants on the Strip that is hitting on all cylinders.    It's just a matter of time until I time a Lavo dinner in there, but that's another yelp mf tale..=)",

Came late on a reservation, but the manager at the hostess stand was awesome and sat us right away. We were offered both inside an outside seating. We chose wrong and went with outside. Terrible vibe and music outside.  Let's start with the good. The food. The food here is actually really good and huge portions!!   We ordered:  Calamari - Pretty good. Not very crisp. Tons of food  Beet Salad - Skip  Meatball with Ricotta - So good!  Carne Pizza - wasn't terrible, wasn't all that impressive either  Cavatelli bolognese - Bomb! Fire!! The best!  Chicken Parm - Surprisingly really good!  Wine - ok  Now - this is what takes good food and destroys the experience. Bad/lack of service.   Server if I can recall was named Eric. And this is where it went downhill. Barely saw him the entire night. Came off super cocky and followed up with sub-par skills. Took 15 minutes just to get our first drink out. Messed up our order, we asked for half and half on the pizza. Told us he would ask and then let us know. Instead - he never came back (ever). Before we knew it we had one of the pizza's that we ordered.  Asked for side of marinara sauce....twice from him and a bus boy. It finally came when they were clearing our table of food. Debated ordering dessert - we wanted it. But our sever never came back, so we asked another server after 10 minutes of waiting for our check because we decided waiting another 15-20 minutes for our original server to come out and actually bring the dessert would not have been worth it.  3 stars....food is pretty good. Huge portions. Inside could have been cool. Very loud and not that good of music. Service - awful.",

I, along with my husband, cousin, and good friend, came here to enjoy a birthday dinner Saturday night. Once we were seated, the waiter came to ask us for our drink orders. My husband and cousin were not quite ready to order their drinks, as the drink menu is quite extensive, but the waiter (I know his name but will not call him out) seemed frustrated. He took my iced tea order, but then took him 10 minutes to come back to finally take the rest of the drink order, but by then we were ready to order our food.   It was busy, but he was joking around with his coworkers RIGHT in front of us for several minutes. It really irritated me, as he acted more as if we were a nuisance than patrons. I am a bit disappointed in his lack of attentiveness, care, and focus--for what you are paying, those should be automatically included. For the record, I still tipped him well, post $220 bill later. But he was a stain on our experience. I am really bummed about that.   But the food--wow. I highly recommend the Cavatelli Agnolotti--this was my husband's dish, but was the best pasta we ordered. The Penne Vodka was OK, but I would have ordered something else if I would have known it was just standard. I really liked the Lobster Bisque and Minestrone soup to start. The starter bread, sauce, and antipasto were fabulous. Overall, the taste explosion blew our minds!",

The bad service started with the hostess. When we went up and let her know we were there for the reservation, she informed us we needed to tell the other hostess (the one standing right next to her) this was after we stood in line for her. No, \"ok, I will let so and so know\" just a rude, you told the wrong hostess. Throughout the dinner, waters went unfilled, we were without drinks most of the meal. We were treated as though we were inconveniencing the waiter when we asked for simple things. We finally asked for the bill after waiting with nothing on the table for over 20 min. My food good, not worth feeling we were forgotten about though. I will not return or recommend. 8 out of the 10 workers we encountered were rude.",

I called ahead to let them know and A girl named Madi answered the phone letting me know that there was no issue and she would see us when we got there. When we finally arrived Madi greeted us with a smile, and even wished my friend a congratulations on her engagement. I had never been greeted so friendly and warm when walking into a restaurant. We got to the table and Molly was our server. She was absolutely adorable and made the whole brunch worth it. I ordered the lobster Benedict and it was outstanding. From the amazing staff to the wonderful food, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "You hear a lot about LAVO -- especially regarding brunch. It's Sunday morning. It's a three day weekend. You got one more full day and night in Vegas. Come to LAVO for bottomless mimosas. Even if it's a normal weekend, I would recommend it anyway. It's a solid brunch spot with reasonable prices. No. Seriously. and it's perfect for when you're staying at the Palazzo because it's right there.  The service is pretty solid. Granted, the few times I have been here have been either normal weekends where it's not too crowded or earlier in the brunch hours. The staff was attentive and made sure we have enough water (and mimosas).  Most recently, we got the breakfast mac and cheese and chocolate chip pancakes on a lowkey brunch. It really was one of the best decisions that we made throughout the whole trip. I have to admit that I wish that the fried eggs on the mac and cheese were more runny and there should have been more pancetta but it was still a solid decision. The pancakes were fluffy, delicious, and had the right amount of chocolate chips. The complimentary pastries were also delicious.   Portion size relative to price was good. I felt like the mac and cheese was richer than I expected and filled me up quicker that I thought -- and for Vegas, the prices, vibe, and food are pretty difficult to beat.",

    "text": "We were a party of 8 with a 7:15 reservation #1698931983. We were from several companies and had a key customer with us. One of the companies CEO was also present.  Got there early and had drinks while waiting to be seated.    ONE HOUR LATER, we were still waiting to be seated.  The person who made the reservation went to the host 4 times asking on the status of our reservation.  After the 3rd visit,  the restaurant bought us drinks and we were told we would be seated next and had a buzzer that would light up when our table was ready.    A few minutes later we see them seating another large party.  WTF!!  After a 4th conversation with the host, one of our colleagues had to leave so now we are 7 people.  When we were finally seated,  they bring us to a tiny table for 6 people WTF!  So with all of us squeezing in and sitting shoulder to shoulder and one of our colleagues standing there in the middle of the restaurant like an idiot waiting for a chair,  someone comes running over with a 7 th chair.   After we all get started and stuffed around the table,  the manager comes over and says he has another table where we may be more comfortable. Great.  We all stand up, grab our drinks and make our way across the restaurant where we finally settle in.    With our pre dinner drinks, we easily spent $150+ per head. We were late for our after hours event atTao that one person in our party's company was hosting.  He paid a lot of money for that event and there were hundreds of his customers there.   The food and table service was good. .. but so what! For that kind of money and in front of a key customer,  I'm trusting and expecting them to get it right!",

This place was the worst high end Italian restaurant I've been to in my life.  Actually it was one of the worst, period. I can't even begin to talk about how good or bad the food here is because it is simply inedible.  It tastes like the cook poured a bucket of table salt into whatever you ordered.  All you taste is salt. I've had the spaghetti with meatballs and it was the worst spaghetti ever. The thing was dry because it had almost no red sauce. It looked and tasted like a 6 year old made it. They are known for their meatballs but the meatballs were nothing special either. Olive Garden is much better.",

Ventured on my own by myself on a Thursday night for \"Seduxion Latin Night\" required nothing else than to walk up to the Club Host and show my ID along with a VIP card. There was a few people on the line. But I found myself walking up stairs to a walkway lined up on both sides with lavatory sinks. Below the walkway is where the resaturant is. Possibly will dine in there in the future. The \"bridge\" walkway had low lighting in this area. Photo opportunity here. I got creative posing next to the sinks. There seems to be an \"invitation to cleanse\" to be in this nightclub with the lavatory sinks in mind. Like an old European ritual. The white sinks were exquisitely set on a low-lighted \"bridge\" walkway that leads to stairs and to a hallway into the nightclub.   Along the way, naturally music started to fill my eardrums. My body molecules was \"jamming\" up rhythmically to the beat of latin music. Awakening my inner latina fire didn't take much long. The DJs spinning the music were enthusiastically encouraging the lively crowd to dancing with the beat. Sweeping spotlights and light effects adds to the tempo of the beat. Room was crowded. Spacious I would think when everyone else is not in this room.  It wasn't long before two friendly latin women became my sudden friends and invited me to join them with their male friends to a raised area which probably is the VIP section in the far end of the room. Several tables with black acrylic-backed sitting. Drinks in carafes and bottled alcoholic drinks were laid out on the table along with beverage wares. In this area is where a beautiful painted mural of a bathing beauty reclined on her side and undraped. A female bending over appears to give her assistance or service. Two rather lightly intoxicated ladies club patrons were dancing slightly wildly on the black raised platforms before this mural. So, the club had some rather raunchy, rowdy, 30s-40s age range club patrons. Although most patrons were well-mannered with everyone. Several bouncers constantly keeping some patrons in control courteously.  The way to the ladies' restroom was low-lighted. The comfort room had black and white Moorish Italianate style. Quite clean, with a lady attendant who was giving out paper towels dligently.   As I like dancing, the dancefloor was filled with dancing club patrons. An expansion of the dancefloor would be a remedy, perhaps. Expect to be in very close proximity with the persons around you while dancing. Everyone was just having a good time. The crowd somehow sang-along to their favorite popular latin music whenever it's played by the DJ. The latin music was invitingly making club goers sway around to the exciting beat. Left the club singly with a latin tune still playing in my mind. Latin music can be seductive music! Seduced crowd! Seductive nights at Lavo! Lavo is a \"wash\" of ultra-club vibe.",

I also have to mention our server Ahmed, who was one of the best servers I have ever had in my life.

The crowd is more decent , yuppies and True professionals compared to the crowd that goes to TAO which is younger or underage ( in my opinion).

Left a nice tip because of our waiter but our $40 steaks were below average and not seasoned well, and left me drinking a ton of water to flush my system from all the salt.

Restaurant must haves: - garlic bread - the waiter had told us it was pretty amazing.  I was thinking \"really, it's just garlic bread\"...all I can say is \"It's pretty amazing\" - meatball as an appetizer (one meatball satisfies 4 people as an appetizer) - Rigatoni Bolognese - Delicious!!  I have been looking for a great bolognese ever since the one time that I ordered something else and my friend ordered the bolognese.  We were supossed to be sharing plates, but once he started eating...he got greedy and only shared one bite...I was so jealous of his food while I ate my so-so food (that he had suggested).    Night Club: The bouncers working the night club was snooty, acting like the club was some super special high class club.  It's like all clubs in Vegas - pretty people, music, dancing and expensive drinks.  Nothing special!",

Our server was nice but very pushy in the beginning  - let's get your order and get you out of here way. He was very knowledge and explained everything but then again it was so fast and in a rehearsed manner that it was almost offensive. Right from the minute he came to our table you had the feeling he just wanted us to order and leave. We did have 3 younger girls (in 20's) so possibly he wrote us off as a low budget table immediately which was far from reality. With all the great restaurants in Vegas unfortunately I wouldn't make an effort to come back here. Also, the manager constantly walked the floor and never looked around or smiled, he walked around like he was too busy to be bothered look which is unfortunate as a smile on your face goes a very long way in the service industry. The food was good but the overall experience just isn't worth the price.",

(Ladies only.) Hey, it was a good deal.  Once we were inside, off to the bar we went.  For one hour.    Like I said, the place was small and there was only one dance room.  They played good top 40 (it was a Sunday) though.  I liked being able to stand up on the surfaces above the booths to dance.    The decor is supposed to be that of a bathhouse.  I don't know what a bathhouse is but it looked nice.  All in all, Lavo was a solid club.  My main complaint is just the size. It wasn't my favorite but if someone suggested going again, I would be down and would have fun.",

My husband asked for him to speak to us directly. He came out and spoke to us an offer a cork fee of $50 a bottle. It was nice he eventually came to.

    "text": "Plain and simple: I had a food and beverage credit to use at either the Venetian or the Palazzo.  I'll admit this early on in my review, spending the credit on beverage/liquor would have been a better way to go.  We've already eaten at a decent number of restaurants between the two hotels and Lavo was one we had yet to try.  On Saturday, my friend and I looked at the menu and it seemed like something we were both interested in.  Since we were staying at the Palazzo, Lavo was convenient as we didn't have far to walk or be in too much of a rush to get ready for our events that night.  FOOD: *Garlic Bread - Complimentary and delicious!  It was smothered with butter and tons of garlic and accompanied with a marinara sauce.  I'll admit, I didn't use the marinara sauce but I thought it was perfect without it.  *Kobe Rice Balls - YUM!  This is the first time I've ever had meat filled rice balls and I loved it.  Although the Kobe beef tasted more like ground beef, the mix of everything was delicious.  The rice balls that contained the beef in the middle had the perfect exterior crisp and placed onto of marinara sauce that had a slight kick to it.  *8 oz Center Cut Filet - No thank you - OVERCOOKED!  I ordered the filet medium rare which should come out with a pink and tender center.  Instead the filet came out medium and was dry throughout the piece of meat.  Also on the plate were roasted garlic (delicious!), some greens, and half a lemon.  SERVICE: Our waitress was great.  She was friendly, energetic and came around several times to check on us.  One complaint, the hostesses are quiet stuck up.  As we walked through the wrong door, we were instructed to walk through to the other side.  There were about 4 hostesses standing around, none who acknowledged us right away.  One looked at us and looked away.  It took about a minute of standing there for one to finally ask how many in our party.  AMBIANCE: Lavo is dimly lit and beautiful with their dark brown wood finishing.  On another note, there is an elevated booth on the bottom floor, if I was getting bottle service during their club hours, I would certainly want to request it!",

I usually order the kobe meatball for an appetizer and the lasagna for my main entree. This week i switched it up and after looking at how good the pictures of the veal parmigiana was i had to see if was as good as it looked.. INDEED it was worth every penny. This actually was my first time even eating Veal and i think i've found my new favorite dish here at LAVO! My friend i was with ordered the traditional spaghetti & meatballs. HUGE portions which is always a plus, very tasty! For dessert the Tiramisu was yet another home run!! 5-stars guys!",

    "text": "I recently spent five righteous days at The Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas between Christmas and New Year's Eve. On the 1st night, I was hanging out with my Family at the 'Imperial Bar', a suggestion was made to go check out 'LAVO'. We walked in and was seated readily by the highly courteous Waitstaff. We ordered a Massive meatball with Ricotta cheese,  a 4-Cheese Pizza, and some soup - we just wanted to keep it simple for this initial visit. While we were waiting, we were given garlic bread with marinara sauce to nibble upon while waiting for the sumptuous meal to come. During our wait, one of the Managers came over and spent a few minutes to greet us, his name was Francis and he recommended that we head over to 'TAO' Nightclub over at The Venetian Hotel. The food arrived and at the first taste I can honestly say this is some of the Absolute Best Italian fare that I have had in several years.   We feasted heartily and then expeditiously trekked over to 'TAO' and saw multitudes of folks trying to get in, only to be consistently shot down in their attempts by gain entry by a platoon of Bouncers who were keeping them at bay with great ease - Considering this scene, it did not seem possible that we would gain entry. We ended up being given access in less than 4 minutes just at the mention of Francis's name - what we experienced inside can only be described as a scene that one would only see in a movie - it was spectacular!!! What a wild conclusion to a most flavorful evening!!!   We made a 2nd visit to 'LAVO' prior to flying out of Vegas, and the ambience along with the food was superior, as it was the first time! I cannot say enough about the customer service they provided, the Waitstaff delivers excellence with a smile every time!!  When I return to Las Vegas, i will be going back to 'LAVO' as the 1st stop on my list. It was excellent experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for Outstanding Italian food in Las Vegas !!!!",

It wasn't a big club but the decor and theme were cool.  It had an Indian/Mediterranean theme that carried into the bathrooms.  The girls of course liked the fact that it had a dance stage and small strip. The music was rockin and played a good variety from Rock n Roll, 80's, Hip Hop and Rap.  It was a bit difficult getting drinks all night since there's only one bar.  Since this place was small, the smoke can get to you if your sensitive to it.  Yes smoking is allowed in all LV nightclubs.  Keep that in mind for the child bearing hotties.  We had one in our group and she had to leave early in the night.",

The sea bass was so savory and tender; it literally melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend getting this plate when you're there.

The decor is very much like the hotel it's in - The Palazzo.  It's got dim lighting, and lots of cool colors.  The bar itself is this awesome semicircle behemoth with flat screen TVs all tuned in to the latest sports.  For our large party, they seated us in a semiprivate section in the back of the restaurant.  It perfectly fit all of us together, and it only got better from there.  We ordered lots of foods since there were so many of us...but all I can say is OMG garlic bread!  By far the best garlic bread any of us had ever eaten!  The calamari was fresh, the GIANT cold seafood tower was awesome, but the garlic bread...yum!  Everyone ordered something different for dinner but no one complained.  Everything LAVO serves to you is well prepared.    And as for dessert - one word.  OREO ZEPPOLES.  This was heaven in your mouth.  And it was served to you with a tall glass of vanilla ice cream.    The prices were very reasonable, even for this New Yorker.  I would absolutely go back there again, for both the service, and the garlic bread/OREO ZEPPOLES.    And for me, they made a mean Grey Goose Cosmo.  Excellent time held by all!",

It was hard to order a drink with so many people crowding and the noise. I went down stairs and it was not as hectic. People sat around the large bar and sat on couches nearby. When I went back up stairs LMFAO was there passing out light sticks. They had expensive jewelry, wild animal print clothes, and they knew how to dance.

    "text": "I've traveled a great deal for work and have been a part of many restaurant openings. I have frequented Lavo, Las Vegas, Nv. about 10 or more times.  On half of those occasions I witnessed staff treating patrons as \"second class\" to other staff members. One instance I witnessed a girl had fallen down their step stairs in the club. They escorted her out, accused her of being drunk and banned her.   In the restaurant one evening a patron was leaving when he was run into by someone running down the stairs. I heard the patron say as he pushed him off, \"Watch where you're going.\" A fair response. The other person took an aggressive stance and threatened the patron. As it turns out the other person was an employee.   I have never cared for the attitude at a business that the customer is there for the benefit of the employee.",

Good thing it had in and outs, so we got some fresh air and went back in after playing a little poker game.   I would go back, lets see how the second experience is.",

Getting into the place didn't take long, but just getting up to the club was a dread. First thing I wondered was, how the hell is a drunk person going to get his ass out of the club after he partied for 4 hrs (good thing it didn't happen to me).   The stairs were never ending but we finally got up to the top. Small place and a huge open bar. The bar was crowded with rows and rows of people trying to get a drink. We ended up waiting for about 10 mins to get our first shot. I recommend going to the smaller bar next to the restroom area.   Music that was played in this place wasn't bad at all. They did play the hits and got a pretty sweet DJ doing some mixes. The only thing I didn't like was how crowded it was. It was crowded enough that if you brought your drinks onto the dance floor, you wouldn't walk your ass out of the floor. You would just drop the glass on the floor and have the girls trip all over it. LOL  Anyways, packed place... might select another place unless it was a Sunday Night. Oh, I did have fun though. LOL",

You can get in for free if you stay at the Palazzo and tell the concierge you want to go to Lavo.

Unlike Tao, the door was very well organized, the people who work here looked very calm and collected. We did not have to play the \"look for the bouncer\" game this time. We were immediately set aside and shown to our table.   The cool thing about table service here is that they have these (ingenious!) cubbies where you can place all your personal items within your table's proximity so that you do not have to worry about (ahem!) losing your stuff during the night.   The service was absolutely impeccable, our waitress was always around, and there was a great ratio of men to women. We all had a great time and would be happy to come back!   The space is really nice, and was completely packed! We were slightly put off by these two women who were hired to grope each other all night in skimpy outfits. They also had a woman security person standing by at all times. Was a bit shocking even for me and I grew up in the Carnaval center of the world (Brazil)!   I said it before and I'll say it again-- New York is not nearly as wild as Vegas is!!!",

They let you sit on people's tables if they're not filled up or reserved yet. But once they do, they'll kick you out. The place was incredibly crowded, but unlike Tao the crowd was good. Good mixture of different types of people and no one seemed like a douche. The music that night was absolutely outstanding, I loved it. It was probably the best place for music that I've been to in Vegas (been to Tryst, Tao, Jet, Christian Audinger, Pure, Bank, and Studio 54 so take my review for what it's worth, there are plenty of other places).  My favorite places so far have been Lavo and Jet. Probably the first two places I'd want to go again when I come back.   It just got too crowded after a while and had to leave because there was no room to dance or do anything. But it's definitely a nice starter place to go to.",

    "text": "LAVO...now what the heck does that word mean?    Oddly enough, when I heard about the LAVO restaurant/nightclub in Vegas, the first visual that came to mind was washing my hands in a basin of sudsy lather (\"lavo\" in Spanish means \"I wash\" - I remember SOME of what I learned in junior high!)  So did LAVO live up to our expectations, or was it really just all washed up in the hype?  Julius and I went to the restaurant around 11:30 at night for Fourth Meal :)  I loved LAVO's rich amber hues and the chandeliers that casted a warm glow over the dining area.  Opulent!  Everything on the Italian-inspired menu looked so decadent that it made me feel bad we weren't hungry enough to go off on all the food.  Not only that, the best thing on the menu was supposed to be the meatball, and I've been on this Pescatarian experiment for a few months now - my resolve wasn't going to be ruined by no freakin' meatball (in my best Jersey accent!) So we ordered the Seafood Plateau Piccolo from the raw bar (the shrimp were big & juicy!) and the Cacciatore brick oven pizza (ehhh....the complimentary garlic bread that they served us was 10x better.)  But theee best thing ever was this dessert that sounds like you could only get it at your county fair.  I don't remember what it's called, but it's this beignet type of pastry with warm, moist Oreo cookies tucked inside.  Oh...my...gawd...this is soooo last meal on earth DELICIOUS!    After dinner, we went to LAVO's nightclub (Quick Tip:  Have dinner at the restaurant, you get free entrance into the club and front of the line privileges!)  My instincts turned out to be dead on...walking up the stairs to the club, the walls were covered in ceramic, bathroom-like tiles.  Along this walkway was a legion of running porcelain sinks.  And up another flight of stairs was a vintage bathtub off to the side.  And inside of the club, more bathroom tiles flanked the walls.  LAVO to me looked like one huge swanky bathroom, just as I had envisioned because of the club's name.  This was underscored as sprays of tiny bubbles floated over us as we shimmied on the dancefloor.  LAVO has a really great vibe - the DJ knew how to keep the dancefloor packed.  So groove on down to LAVO for some eats and beats, and get ready for some lavish fun!",

I could practically hear the next table's entire conversation and I could even elbow the lady next to me if I wanted to.    After dinner we decided to check out the nightclub upstairs.  TERRIBLE.  It was the smallest club I have ever been to in Vegas.  There was only one bar and an itty bitty tiny dance floor.

Wine list was great for Italian wine fans like me. Service was bit blunt and arrogant but when dining in good company with good food and wine, it's secondary - I'm European yes. I would think this place is also kids friendly. Petit stake I enjoyed was fantastic!  PS. owners/managers - the idea with the sink in the restroom is not designed correctly.

We sat at the bar, watched the game, and chatted up about what was going on in our lives.  We decided to order some appetizers to go with our cocktails, as neither one of us was super hungry.  Well....  Being a resident of the great Sin City, I scoff at these over priced restaurants that reside on the Strip.  I try, like every other local, to avoid the Strip as much as possible.  But on the odd occasion that finds me inside a mega hotel, I bite the bullet and pay the price - literally.  We ordered the mozzarella balls (yes, balls not sticks) and the Kobe beef ball.  Come to think of it, I see a pattern forming here, but I digress...  While the food was excellent (dish #1 was 3 mozzarella balls deep fried with a marinara sauce and a watercress salad - dish #2 was 1 rice and peas shaped ball filled with ground beef - Kobe, I think not tho- fried to a crisp), it was hardly worth $22 each dish.  They are appetizers, True, but at that rate, I wouldn't be able to afford dinner.  We ate in happy fashion, watched the game du jour, and merrily drank our over priced martinis.  After the food though, we booked it, as we noticed the line forming and the club crowd gathering.  Would I go again?  Probably not...",

Not sure how they decided on this concept as I never would think that people want pounds of bread, pasta and meatballs before dancing the night away at the club.  With that said, the food is pretty decent, but the atmosphere makes it a fun experience.   DECOR/ATMOSPHERE:  Definitely not indicative of the food as you would expect the place to serve Asian fusion by its look.   Dark lighting, spacious, high ceilings and lively music make for an energetic and fun atmosphere.  Most of the clientele is the young and trendy crowd preparing for the night out.",

    "text": "This review is for the club.  We were a group of six guys who came here on Friday night. We had arranged bottle service with a host called Roman and there was only a one bottle minimum which was nice (some of the bigger clubs would make you buy two or more bottles for a group of 6 guys). We ended up getting two anway but it was nice that it wasn't required to get a table.  I have been to the club at Lavo a few times and have always had a good time. Its a bit small and doesnt have the visual wow factor of a place like XS but the music is always good and I have always found the guys at the door to be way more courteous than at other clubs.   This time we got bottle service and our contact at the club, Roman, was really a class act. He got us in promptly, and checked in on us to make sure we were happy. He even texted a couple times (including the next day, yes for real, he texted the next day to say he hoped we had a good time.. easy to do but i've never had a host do that before). When I texted him later that night to ask if he could get a friend in who was late he replied in moments saying it was no problem. My friend took a long time showing up and Roman took the initiative to check with me if he had showed up or not. All pretty basic stuff, but again I've rarely seen the host so on top of things.  The service here was so much better than how we got treated the next night at Marquee. I think in the future when I come to vegas I will avoid the newest club and go with a classic. I think of places like Tryst that way and I'm adding Lavo to the list. Seems like a sure thing.",

I thought most of the night clubs in ATL would have lager dance floors than Lavo. I didn't see any go go dancers though. Anyways, went there on Christmas day, and the dance floor was packed! Music was good and I enjoyed dancing pretty much. Bouncers were not nice, but they were not rude, either. I will not come to this club again, unless I stay in Palazzo Hotel. Hey!

It was sort of an odd hour, after gambling in Palazzo, so the place wasn't too happening yet. Ambient music was being mixed by an on-site DJ so that was cool. We shared a few things... calamari (decent), tuna tartare w/ avacado (refreshing), kobe meatball w/ sausage ragu (amazing), & spaghetti carbonara (so creamy rich I had to drink something after each bite... but STILL excellent). Great decor but what the real trip was the restroom sinks. My first though walking into the restrooms, \"damn, those are some tall urinals\" hahaha Which were actually sinks  but shaped like some sort of rituallistic cyllinders. FYI: they're not motion sensored so stop waving your hands like an idiot and use the foot pedal!",

The food though, the pastas were mediocre the \"prime dry aged steak\" was a good cut of meat, small for the price but burnt to a crisp on the outside. Usually medium rare doesn't involve a burnt layer going around it.  The food overall wasn't done that well, and while I expect Vegas price I hoped the food would be worth it. Cocktails were solid.",

Dancers were pretty cool in that they dance on the tables (some while you eat haha), but nothing mind blowing.

I had to keep reminding myself that it was only 4 in the afternoon because it was loud, exciting and dark, like a nightclub on a busy Saturday night! There was a DJ, bottle service all around, people dancing on tables, dancers and more! I could hardly believe how exciting it all was!  Our friends had champagne, bottles and food, it just kept coming! The servers were great and attentive, even with the loud music and dark room. Everyone was having a blast! There were large groups of parties, couples having brunch and a dance floor full of people! There were goodies all over the place like sunglasses, key chains, bottle openers and more.  I had such a blast coming to Lavo for this brunch. I expect the night time to be just as exciting!",

I am more into hip hop than I am into EDM/rave music, and the music was a good blend of both which I did enjoy free drinks (I believe from 1-3) Not a super long wait for the bathrooms, they have a second one upstairs The environment is really fun. The staff member passed up glow sticks, glow necklaces, some had a paddle that said spank me and would spank anyone that asked. They encourage dancing on tables that are left out  Cons: It is a brunch, so the whole place was covered with tables.I mean, full of them. It get really awkward trying to dance with someone eating right next to you.  Because of the crowd, your either dancing next to tables or dancing next to the bar, which is inconvenient for people who are just trying to buy a drink and leave.  Overall, my friends and I had fun here. Haft of us liked hip hop and the other haft EDM, so it was a good blend for us all to be happy.  This place could be better if they made more space for people to enjoy themselves.",

They went above and beyond just serving us, and this was matched with delicious food. We started off with the lobster bisque soup, which might be the best one I've ever tried. It was so rich and creamy, with a sufficient amount of lobster inside too. A must try! Then we got the penne seafood alfredo which was incredible. Penne can usually get boring, but this was anything but that. For dessert, I first got the tiramisu which I didn't love but my server Thomas was great, went back and got me the panna cotta instead. This dessert was delicious. Overall, great experience and I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants good Italian food.",

LOL We started with the meatball and complementary garlic bread with marinara and the crudites tray.  After enjoying those items and having the calamari and Kobe rice balls we were stuffed!! My friend got the chicken Parm and I enjoyed the eggplant pasta. However, I ended up taking almost all the main entree home because we were so full.

Still a tiny club but it is super convenient when you are staying at the Palazzo and all your girl friends arrive to Vegas around 10:30pm.

All the girls got in free and the club was dead inside but that didn't stop us from having fun with the 20-30 other ppl still in there.  It was mostly hip-hop and other random songs at that point of the night.  The bouncers wanted us to dance on the ledge behind the DJ which was fun.  We all got free Ciroc and cranberry using our hotel coupons that we got at the front desk when checking in.  Each booklet has a coupon for free entry and drinks for up to 4 people.  Sweet!  After we left Lavo they told us to walk to Tao and get in with our Lavo stamp.  So that we did!  Haha.  Fun night, no stress.  I wouldn't come here as my main Vegas club event, but it was an easy late Friday night out activity.    I NEED TO TRY LAVO PARTY BRUNCH THOUGH!!!!!  I bet that would be fun.

From the classy interior (including a second floor old-timey casino lounge) to the outrageously attentive service to the delicious Italian food (appetizers through espresso)...LAVO would absolutely be your all-time favorite Italian place if it (and you) were back in the suburbs of Ohio or Tennessee or wherehaveyou.  As it is, LAVO has to compete with dozens of other top-shelf options within walking distance and that's where you went wrong. VEGAS HAS SPOILED YOU.  Though LAVO is roomey enough to easily accommodate large groups, I had a very small group sit down in a nice corner and enjoyed a brilliant 3-course meal where nothing we ate was less than excellent. The espresso and tiramisu deserve special recognition as there is no letting the foot off the pedal where many places leave dessert as an afterthought. Again, this was truly delicious from start to end.   I've walked by this place many a time without even considering going in. If there's any downside it's that its location is so obvious it's kind of hidden in plain sight, but absolutely do not overlook this additional Italian GEM on the strip.  Also, this place is a fantastic litmus test for your date. If he/she is turning his/her nose up at LAVO then I ain't sayin' (s)he a gold digger...",

It's something like $8 per carafe. Looking at some other reviews, apparently this is something they like to pull to jack up the bills. Not cool, Lavo.",

    "text": "I don't do too many reviews and especially negative ones but I worked in high end restaurants throughout college and consider myself a bit of a foodie. Overall experience was lackluster. Ambience was good but service and dishes were not. Given we did come in as a family of 5 with kids 8,10 and 13 so the young server tried to rush us out. With the greeting of the table he wanted to take a drink order, apps, and entree immediately. I had to ask for the specials. Clam app was overly salty and pooled in grease. Spicy lobster bisque was not spicy at all and actually pretty bland. Kale strawberry salad was great. Entrees came out 45 min later and ranged from hot to room temp to sat in the window for a while. Sea bass was great but the fried porteballos that topped the dish were obviously pre-cooked and cold. Chicken Marsala was cold.  It was re-made and came out hot this time but was so saturated with overly thick sweet sauce over soggy spinach it was inedible.  Honestly tasted more like orange chicken than Marsala. Brussel sprout side dish had good flavor but cold and greasy. My two boys enjoyed the buttered noodles and Alfredo. I didn't have the heart to call out that the Alfredo was broken with a pool of butter under the pasta. I will say that they took off the sprouts and chicken Marsala but we still paid well over $300. I was very much looking forward to this dinner all week and was very disappointed.  On a positive note, Kudos to the bussers!",

I politely nodded through the explanation of the menu (appetizers on the left, pizzas in the middle, entrees on the right) and we promptly ordered a bunch of small plates, sides, and 70-year-old tequila.  Waiter's demeanor changed immediately.  Despite having a sad, stale excuse for a garlic bread service, Lavo was decent. I loved the dark, contemporary atmosphere. The food was good, but not fantastic. Our offerings were sequenced and spaced nicely.   My favorite dish was actually the haricot verts with pine nuts, which were blanched, shocked, and sauteed in an obscene amount of garlic and butter, giving them a fiesty texture. The assertive, nutty vinaigrette with the tuna tartare took a close second, but the dish had far too much avocado to call it a True win.  In all, we left satisfied, but bemused.  Don't underestimate your customers. We have as much of an opportunity to surprise you as you do to surprise us.",

When our waitress finally came over she told us the specials  and disappeared for another 15 minutes. She came back and said she was taking drink AND food order. It was at least an hour after we were seated until we were served our drinks!!! We complained to a manager and he basically just stood there and listened.  We had to flag down a random server to take our second drink order.  The rose' sangria was clear the first time and dark the second. The dirty martinis were watery and served with olives coated in oil which ruins the entire drink. Again we had to flag someone down to send it back. No table touching, no eye contact whatsoever. The food was a big disappointment. I had the Chilean Sea Bass along with a few others at the table. It was strong and fishy tasting.  My husband had tuna which had no flavor at all. The service was terrible. We were served our meals and drinks and no one ever checked back with the table. Another friend had pasta with seafood and was never given a plate for shells even after asking for it. She was never even offered Parmesan cheese! The restaurant is beautiful, the service was poor and the food and drinks weren't good.",

I didn't come to Vegas to order room service or go to some quiet empty place. And I want good service.   Lavo passed all my 'Vegas requirements' with flying colors. When you arrive you are brought warm garlic bread and marinara sauce. It's the perfect start to the meal and it's hard not to eat all of it.    For starters we shared what seemed to me to be the worlds largest meatball. It was fantastic - moist, and flavorful. Also covered in that tart and sweet marinara sauce.  We also had the beet salad. A healthy choice still packed with tastiness.   For entrees we had the chicken, the pasta and a steak. Everything was delicious!",

Great food and view. The staff was very friendly. I felt a little awkward when I went to the restroom. There's no door so people at their tables could see me entering and exiting the stall. The sink sensor wasn't very responsive so people at the tables got a good laugh watching me make karate chopping motions trying to get the water to start :-) We would definitely return and try dinner on the balcony.

The man behind the host desk told us it would be a few minutes before we were seated which wasn't a problem. After about 10 minutes we decided to sit at the bar. Super friendly enthusiastic bartenders!  After waiting at the bar for about 20 minutes we thought maybe the host had forgotten about us. He approached us shortly after apologizing. We apparently had been given a defective buzzer. He told us we would be seated immediately and would be given a complimentary round of drinks.  We had a great table in the middle of the restaurant. The atmosphere was awesome. Great trendy music,low lighting-it was the perfect vegas atmosphere. The food was delicious! The tomato basil spaghetti was super flavorful and my boyfriends chicken mushroom ravioli was the best he had ever tasted. His portions were a tad small, but he still thoroughly enjoyed it. Our waiter was extremely friendly, attentive and willing to answer all of our questions. The busboys were also extremely attentive. Excellent customer service, food and atmosphere.

Lavo has the luxury open bar from 10:30-Midnight on certain weekends. Whenever I plan a trip, open bar for the ladies at Lavo is always an option.   Whenever I am in sin city the only drinks I can drink is red-bull vodka to keep my sleepy-self awake throughout the night. I know, I know.. energy drinks + sugar + alcohol is not great for your diet plus health. But it's sin city! Gluttony and debauchery is allowed.   Music played here is always Top 40's + Mainstream Hip Hop unless stated otherwise. Mind you this is not a full nightclub. It is more of a big lounge with room to walk and breathe. There is bottle service for you fancies out there. Located in the Palazzo, on the entrance side. So you cannot missed it. Great place to pre-pahty, but don't get too trashed so you can jump to the next club. Staff are not peculiar, crowd ranges a lot since this is not usually the club folks would stay for the rest of the night.   I wouldn't mind trying out the food here. The cover photo dish looks pretty delicious actually. :)",

Not only is the bottle service affordable, if you don't finish what you have -- you can take it back to your room.  As for the music?  Awesome.  We were fortunate enough to see Lupe Fiasco doing his own set... and I was like whattt?  Lupe Fiasco?!  He DJs?!  He does, and he's not bad at all.  Good crowds of people too.  As soon as I sat down, folks at the other table were talking to me.  But once the music started playing I got crazy.  I even got up on the table wall thingies and literally freaked every girl on them.  I quickly went down after first glimpse of seeing a bouncer tell someone to get off... but as soon as he was gone, it was back to the top!   I literally did that all night.  Yes, I was still recovering from my 4-foot Fat Tuesday, but Lavo was just a smackin good time.  Drinks are the $15 you'd expect in Vegas, but screw it I had bottle service.

Well drinks only.   The scene: Small venue compared to all the other clubs out here. Nice decor. More table areas then a dance floor.  There is no outside patio. Not much seating if you do not have a table.  The music and dance floor: mainly hip hop and some edm. Because the dance floor was small it got crowded quickly ut we managed to keep an area for our group without a problem.  The crowd: More of a 35 and over club and men in business attire. We were probably the youngest group there but that didnt matter.  The bartenders: The main bar was great drinks were perfect. Open bar for ladies what there to complain about? Whoever the bartender at the small bar made our drinks incorrectly. Asked for a vodka colins and I saw her poor tequila. Lol we were all too drunk to complain at this point.   There is a small seating area near the elevator where u can rest if they its not used for bottle service that day.   Overall our group had a great time. Regardless of the size of it and crowd.

The entire restaurant was completely empty yet they sat us in the table in the corner next to the bus boy station.  Minutes later they set a group of eight at the table right next to us so behind us we had all the waiters talking banging things making all kinds of noise and in front of us was the loudest group of people you can imagine.  Yet the entire restaurant is empty.  It was so bad the waiter bumped into my friend twice I'm like this is b.s. The whole place is open and the waiter has the touch my friend? I ordered the meatball Panini which was $17 didn't come with fries came with a little side salad.  So I paid extra for an order of fries and a Diet Coke.   $4.50 for a Diet Coke.  I asked the waitress for a refill and she said OK but I have to charge you we don't get free refills.  I mean they even give free refills at McDonald's the food was way over salted and not very good.   As a Las Vegas local we go to brunch at different restaurants practically every week.  This by far was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever been to.  For all their little up charges and terrible service go and have a much better meal at The country club at Wynn.

Space-wise it can get pretty cramped because it's a bit on the smaller side, but nowhere near as uncomfortably packed as Tao. Dance floor is pretty tiny, but honestly, I didn't notice it until the place had mostly cleared out and I got a good look around. They play hip-hop and a lot of old songs, but old in a way that makes you go \"oh man, I haven't heard this song in a while, but  it's still awesome,\" which I think is a nice change of pace from all the clubs that play almost exclusively house music.  Lavo is probably a 3.5 in my book, though I have to admit, part of the reason for that is because we had open bar, courtesy of our wonderful promoter (who also got our guys in for free!) There's a main bar area, but we got all our drinks from the side bar, which was super crowded and only had one bartender working there. But he was a really adorable and sweet bartender, so no complaints.  tl;dr: Everyone in my group had a fairly fun time. Would definitely come back-- especially if we're staying at the Venetian/Palazzo!",

It would have been nice to get our drink orders in at least.   So we are chit chatting talking barely made a dent in out apps and then our salads come out.      So now our tables is covered in food and its coming to fast.      I call over waiter and ask him to give us some time in between courses.   We received the apps and salads in matter for 10 minutes.      As we are talking another party comes but at our tables.     They are obviously drinking and making a distracting scene.     Yes I know it is Vegas and every one drinks.   But that doesn't mean you act ignorant.     However our dinner comes 10 minutes later and we still haven't finished our apps or salads so food is on table getting cold.     In the meantime, other table is getting louder and louder.    I ask the waiter to ask them to bring it down  a bit.     He then proceeds to tell me the table is friends with the owner.    And I said I understand I just want the to turn it back a little.     Not less than 1 minute later, the waiter goes to the table and tells them I wanted them to be quiet.      The other tables then starts to act ignorant (Dear Owner, I hope you talk to  your friends, it is bad reflection of the ownership)    We ignore them but livid with waiter on how he handles situation.    I ask the waiter to bring manager. The manager does not show up for 15 minutes.    Come to find out the waiter, tells manager that we started an altercation with other table.   I then grow livid.    We just finished our meal and left...Such a disappointment.",

The garlic  bread is to die for! I'll be talking about it for the next 6 months. I love the marinara sauce because it doesn't taste like someone jazzed up some Prego and slapped it on some pasta. It's not super thick sauce but it sure is tasty. The Kobe meatballs are so ridiculous. It's like, how am I gonna eat another meatball after that? I'm gonna turn into a full throttle meatball snob.   I've never had dessert here because I'm too stuffed to even think about eating dessert after dinner.  Make reservations. We tried to go once and hardly got a table.",

Our group ordered 1) one of the steaks with a huge side of garlic mashed potatoes, 2) the louie salad with lobster and shrimp, 3) spaghetti carbonara, 4) a bolognese pasta dish and 5) I got the chicken parmagiani.   The service was top-notch and worthy of an upscale restaurant: they refolded your napkin if you got up to use the restroom or go to the bar, they knew to refill ladies' water glasses first, etc. They even had a restroom attendant to hand you paper towels. They even gave us a free round of drinks for our group of five because they couldn't seat us until 30 minutes after our reservation. (This wasn't off-putting for us, since it was a fun atmosphere.)  The portions are quite large and worth the price. They are known for their giant meatballs, which we unfortunately did not sample. However, they do provide free garlic bread with marinara which the table fought over.  The ambiance gives off fun vibes, but it is very noisy.  If you dine there, you get free admission to the club upstairs.",

It was a Tuesday night and the entire place from the lounge, to the restaurant to the nightclub was packed.  We had martinis to start out and their absolutely delicious garlic bread with marinara was sent out.  Wisely we each only had a piece to save room for the food the chef was sending out to us.    We didn't actually order off the menu since we were just sent out a few small plates to taste.  Our waiter brought us a margeherita flat bread pizza, spicy egg plant and buffalo mozzarella pasta and garlic mashed potatoes.  All were melt in your mouth yummy, I couldn't stop eating the pasta (to the misfortune of my little cocktail dress) it had the tangy tomato fondue taste with buffalo mozzarella and then this divine after bite of spicy eggplant.    We also had dessert, one of Lavo's specialties, deep friend oreos. Now this is not your typical carnival food.  This was a beignet wrapped around an oreo with a side of cookies and cream ice cream for dipping.  Heaven.  The restaurant had a live DJ and it was on the energetic side but the music was at the right volume to easily carry on a conversation.  Also, Neil, are server was great!  Very attentive, knowledgeable and funny.  We went up to the nightclub after and ehhh...I've been to alot better, most of Vegas in fact.  The vibe was alot of fun, they had a good DJ spinning house music but the club is too small and far too crowded for me.  I like to actually be able to dance more.",

The only downfall was the silly pirate show across the street at TI.  Luckily, it only goes on for 15 minutes or so, but consider yourself warned that it gets LOUD when they are doing their thang.    Service was prompt and our server was nice.  We especially loved him when he brought out freshly baked garlic bread.  Salads were huge and could have easily been eaten as a meal (salad #1 was a roasted beet salad and salad #2 was a chopped louie).  Entrees were chicken marsala and brick oven salmon - both totally delicious.  Oh, and the rock salt roasted potato?  Get it if carbs are your friend.    We were too full to even entertain the dessert menu, but I'm sure they were just as great!  Lavo, we didn't try your meatballs, but maybe next time!",

I went at around 7PM, so they were really busy, but the service was still excellent.  A few weeks back I went back, and this time decided to eat at around 5:30, so it would be a quieter atmosphere. The Garlic Bread was burnt, and the Meatballs lacked that wow factor. Overall, I was very disappointed by the lack of consistency. I was raving about Lavo for a year after my first experience, and now I don't even want to go back.   Damn you Lavo! Now I have to find another Italian place in Vegas!",

Jenna Q and I asked about bottle service and got a quick answer of $150's the cheapest for mixed couples. Oh, mixed couples like our group you mean, 3 girls and 2 guys.  We got excited to be let into a busy looking club at such a price. Until, they put us downstairs. The music was good, I couldn't complain, but it was too much of a lounge area playing old school hip hop (and not enough Vegas dunst dunst dunst dunst). So after some negotiating April P.'s bf received some apologies and also some free drink tickets, they \"found\" us a table upstairs. And we move, the upstairs is filled! Not a good thing, but not so bad for us because we had our own little space to privately dance in.   I get approached by our new server and she says \"Oh it's latin night, I hope you don't mind latin music mashed up with hip-hop. And what mixers did you want with the bottle?\" AND NOW I GET IT... \"mixed couples\" meaning non latino. Shoooot at $150 a bottle, I'll take it.   So we danced danced the night away and watched a costume contest, that can only be understood if you habla espanol. I had fun LAVO, see you again, when I next see Vegas!",

They offered us inside or out, and we ended up on the patio with a decent view of the strip and great view of the pirate show at T.I.   We started off by talking to the server about the menu and ordering a bottle of wine. It was evident they were really pushing the kobe meatballs, (from our discussion with the server as well as listening to servers talking to tables around us). The meatballs were good but not the incredible meatballs we were expecting. It was more of a large ball of meatloaf.   For dinner we had calamari, a pizza and the chicken parm., all was OK but the chicken was very sub par with a rubbery texture almost. The service was good for the most part but missing the little touches that make you want to pay 30+ an entree, especially with so many choices in Vegas.   I was nervous going in because of the fact that is doubles as a nightclub and owned by the same group as Tao. The meal was all in all OK, but would next time visit a different place.   The most annoying part of it all, we asked to speak to the manager about coming back to check out the nightclub. They said no problem show the host your receipt and they will stamp you for re entry. After our show around midnight we showed up and offered the (bouncer ??) our wrist with the stamps, two of them looked at each other and laughed as if this was a common practice.   We ended up going in anyway and the club had a good feel and nice layout, just a little empty.",

The promoters and bouncers outside were really nice, and dressed beautifully, pocket square and all. The club itself is kind of small, and the dance floor is tiny. LOTS OF GUYS. I was surrounded by guys at one point in the night and I decided to make my escape to the bar area.   I won a contest and got a pair of tickets + drinks to see Cosmic Gate play here. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there were a handful of high ranking DJs at the other clubs, so Lavo was a bit empty. The girls and I had a space to sit while we're tired, and didn't need to fight to get the bartender's attention. The free drink tickets kept on coming!   Too bad for Cosmic Gate, the dance floor emptied around 2am, and I was able to go up all the way to the booth. Around that time the managers probably got the hint and turned on the lights. Poor CG, I still love you!",

    "text": "I can only speak to my restaurant experiences as I haven't yet taken part in the night club experience (and probably never will).    The food on each of my last two visits was terrific. My wife enjoyed the Kobe meatball with ricotta cheese and I usually lean towards the chicken parm, both of which were delicious.   The service was a whole different story. It was so bad that it takes what should be a 5 star rating down to what should be less than a \"2\".    After checking in for our reservation, we opted to take a seat at the bar and have a drink before dinner (this was mistake #1). We alerted the hostess to this and she said no-problem. We were then greeted by the slowest bar tender on the planet, who struggled to tend to ourselves and 2 other customers she had at her bar (it was early in the evening and the place was nearly empty). After walking past us at least 3 times, she finally decided to stop. Seeing the disgust in my face, I immediately detected a bit of an attitude from the gal, when she asked if we needed a drink menu. A while later, another male employee hands us a drink menu. The bar isn't that big - how difficult is it to locate a drink menu? The bartender eventually returns to take our drink order, with my wife getting a glass of Pinot and I asked for a Coors Light. I was immediately told they don't have Coors Light (yet the Palazzo bar across the lobby does). In fact, you can get a Coors at darn near any bar in the Venetian or Palazzo....except at Lavo. I thought to myself, \"this is the Lavo at the Palazzo and they can't walk a few feet for the overpriced beer I requested .... really? The cocktail waitresses throughout the casino can walk hundreds of yards for a customer's free beer and a lousy tip .... but god forbid the staff at Lavo walk a few feet for the customer actually paying for their beer.  We return to the attractive (but not so bright) hostess who greeted us earlier, asking to be seated. She immediately grabs my wife's Pinot and pours it into a plastic cup, saying \"you can't leave with the glass\". I point out to her that we're not leaving, instead, asking to be seated at our table. She then catches on to her goof and seats us.   On to dinner. Again food was terrific but service was marginal. I ordered a baked potato with my dinner, which arrived with my meal. I asked for 2 portions of butter as I wasn't interested in their spicy butter concoction. The waiter breaks open my potato in such grand fashion and said he'd return with my butter. Roughly 10-15 minutes later, our waiter returns and asks if we needed anything. I responded, stating \"yes, the butter I asked for earlier\". Realizing his mistake, he hurried off. A few minutes later, I see him at another table taking drink orders. Really, my potato is colder than my ice water and he's taking drink orders? Eventually, he returns with a rock hard piece of butter (looked like a bar of soap), which never melts on my potato. I didn't eat it as I wanted him and hopefully the Manager to see the state of the potato with un-melted butter.   The bill arrives and the waiter indicates that the $11 potato was removed by his Manager, the same Manager who was too busy to walk about the restaurant and check on customers??? Low class joint.   The food is very good but the staff and the service they provide was far from Venetian or Palazzo standards. They should hire fewer \"pretty\" people and more \"skilled\" service professionals. They tout the place as \"fine dining\" but I've gotten 10x better service from the Grand Lux Cafe and The Coffee Bean in the hotel.  Never returning.",

The food & drinks were amazing; however, a bit pricey (but you are on the strip after all...).   The upstairs portion was not that bad. Small dance floor with a nice bar next to it.

I had asked the meatball to be brought at the same time as our entrees but, it was brought as an appetizer. It was so freaking delicious, I didn't even care. I will return a hundred times for the meatball if not for anything else. The complimentary bread & sauce was very good. I ordered spaghetti with tomato & basil and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband ordered chicken mushroom ravioli. Not so great. It had an odd brown gel-like sauce. It was not at all what my husband was expecting and it was a really small portion. He ordered an extra order of the bread ($6) because he wasn't full. Our service was ok. Drinks went empty and never were refilled, so we drank water. The GM came around and was very nice. Even more so when we told him we were locals. Then we ordered dessert and it took 30+ minutes for it to arrive. We had to pick up our show tickets 1 hour before the show and we barely made it! The waiter was apologetic about the long wait & finally offered to refill our drinks at that point. The zeppole Oreos were delicious, just not sure why it took so long. Had we not had the show to get to, I would not have minded as the people watching was fabulous. Overall the giant Meatball was the star of this dinner. Can't wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy the patio seating. A little expensive ($125w/tip) for a pasta dinner, but it wasn't shocking. It was expected.",

After we closed the bar I took one of my bartender with me to go check it out becasue I never been there before. When we got there the doormen were very rude( like all wanna be fat, tuff UFC clowns) I told them my friend had a table there after they ate dinner and they are still here and were on the list to going them. I also give him my card and told him i was a GM of a place in PH if they every needed anything trying to be nice. Still dick heads and wont let us in to see if my boy was there because my phone was dead. The manager came over and same thing just a dickhead. They didnt even care to let us check when we were on the list for the table. wowow  we went to TAO and walked right in because the Managers there were cool.",

    "text": "Review for nightclub only:  The key to an awesome night out in Sin City is to pre-party in your hotel room.  Why? Because drinks at teh club cost an arm and a leg. :P A shot of vodka, and a couple shots of nigori sake.  Holy crap is that the line to get into Tao. \"Please keep moving,\" says security around Tao. \"We're moving, we're moving.\"  Memorial Day weekend, what do you expect? Let's try Lavo. We missed the guestlist aka we didn't have enough girls in our group to bypass the line.  The line was shorter, thank goodness. Cover, fine...  As we walked upstairs, there was a line of \"sinks\" with water coming out of them. Random much? Are we suppose to wash our hands here? Where's the restroom?  /holds hands with the other girls as we serpentine our way to the restroom  What happen to the rest of the crew? Let's get drinks. Double jameson & coke and a vodka pineapple, $38. Ugh, 1st thought, should have drank MORE in the hotel room. 2nd thought, okay where's the rest of the crew? \"Why do you already have a drink? I got you one.\" Oh, there's a smaller bar, over yonder.   /Dance  \"That guy's an asshole.\"  Time for another drink, another vodka pineapple, double makers and coke, and a long island iced tea. $52. Awesome.  /Dance  We made our way downstairs, because the restaurant closed. We sat down until we got kicked out and made our way to the exit.   WTF is the birthday boy doing with three security guys? HAHA.  I think I was drunk by this time, and fell about three (3) times according to Miss V. =)  5-hour energies do work...too bad we forgot to take some before heading to the club.   Good times.",
