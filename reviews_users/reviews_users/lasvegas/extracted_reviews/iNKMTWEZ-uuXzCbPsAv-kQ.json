    "text": "So happy we finally have Cafe Zupas in Vegas. I can't think of another place we have like it. The food is made quickly and right in front of you, the selections are great, and extremely affordable. Especially because they have combos so u can get soup, salad, or sandwich paired together.   The BBQ pulled pulled pork sandwich is one of their more popular sandwiches and I like the touch of the fresh red cabbage slaw in it.  Each sandwich even comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.  As for the salads, the Nuts About Berries and Shanghai Chicken are both great choices and the half size was big enough to fill me up.   The lobster bisque was creamy and had chunks of lobster in it. It also comes with a slice of french bread to dip in it.   Their dessert case makes everything look so tempting. I tried the Hazelnut Cream Creme Brulee and found it was very light and just a little on the sweet side. But no complaints.   This is definitely a good place to stop for a quick, healthy, and tasty lunch. But don't forget, they're not open on Sundays!",

She went over the menu and made suggestions of what to try.  I had the pesto chicken pannini. It was good. Like the other reviews, the portions are small. I  was surprised at how small the sandwich was compared to the big box it was in. Maybe I'm not used to an actual serving size. None the less I have no complaints. I didn't feel heavy after eating my sandwich.  Nice to have more healthy alternatives in the area. I definitely return to try more items on the menu.  The decor is nice. The place is very bright inside. At times it was hard to hold a conversation due to the loud music.   Overall, you guys will see me again.",

I mean when you go in and place an order say for a family of 4, or goodness a whole office, then when you get down the line to pay, they want you to repeat the whole order again! Are you kidding me??? I don't know I just told you! Secondly, I am a young fit person, so this isn't laziness but if you place an order to go, say of soup, I would like a spoon to be put into the bag. Crazy idea right?? They make you go over to where the utensils and drinks are, again think of someone who comes here on a quick break during lunch rush, you should toss a spoon in their bag and out the door they go, no you want to send them to the crowded drink area just for a spoon. Inconvenient and silly if you ask me!",

You walk into a well decorated and laid out Resteraunt with awesome amenities like a \"charge bar\" where you can charge your phones/tablets , drink station and comfortable bright seating. The fresh produce displayed on all the TVs makes you feel like farm fresh produce is right in the back of house still in the ground ready for picking!   Now comes the ordering! You walk up to the first station, I ask a simple question...\"do you have gluten free bread?\" Answer=no!  Strike one.. This franchise should know many people need gluten free options. Even other delis offer gluten free bread. Ok, I get a salad. I ask if they have any gluten free dressing... \"Oil and vinegar only!\"  Depressing. I ordered a Asian chicken salad (hold the chicken) and they add chicken anyway. I press i feeling disappointed but still hopeful. I figure my stomach will hurt a little from the gluten in the salad dressing but I'll be ok. I go to pay and was surprise I received a luscious chocolate covered strawberry with my meal.  I sit down and taste the salad... Drum roll please!!!!! ..... Boom! Amazing! Packed full of flavor! It was worth the tummy risk! Strawberry was delectable and the atmosphere welcoming!   I feel like the mistakes made as well as lack of options for those who have allergies is not good. They need to up the game a bit. But it was good. I'd return!",

They have ordering down to a science and the employees are very friendly.   I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the Wild Mushroom Bisque. The food came out in a very timely manner. The bill came to around $12 which is very reasonable.  They have self serve drinks where you can get the napkins and utensils.   I decided to sit at the counter. There is a little screen where you can watch videos and be entertained. There are also plugs available to charge your phone which is great planning.   The Cuban sandwich, Wow! one of the best I have ever had. The crust was nice and crunchy and inside was nice and soft. The pork was so tender. They add roasted peppers to it which I love. It was so savory and delicious.   The Mushroom Bisque, It was so amazing, they added crispy onions on top which was another element that perfectly complimented the soup. There were nice big pieces of mushroom in it which gave a nice texture to the soup. They also give you a piece of baguette which I promptly cleaned the soup bowl with.   One really nice thing they do is give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. Talk about a sweet ending. You cant help but smile after devouring it.  I will definitely go there again...",

It took weeks for the store manager and now district manager Jon Poole to even acknowledge my complaint. Once I did hear from him he offered (via email) for us to dine again but said nothing of the way we should go about doing it. After how poorly this has been handled so far and no one being on the same page I was not going to just go back to the location hoping someone knew that I was told to return for a complimentary visit. I of course responded to his email invitation immediately and guess what?! He has NOT responded and that was now almost a week ago. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.   I called the corporate office back this morning and pressed the prompt to speak with a receptionist hoping to get contact info for someone at a higher level to help me but I was transferred to a lady in accounts payable who could tell me nothing but to email their generic address \"<a href=\"mailto:info@cafezupas.com\">info@cafezupas.com</a>\" mind you, this was the first step I took when the incident happened and nothing. It's becoming a running joke now.  All I want is to be reimbursed! If you choose to dine there just hope there isn't a credit card issue or an issue with your meal bc solving guest issues clearly isn't a concern of theres",

The Yuzu Miso vinaigrette is made in house and perfect when you are craving sweet and fruity flavors. Edamame, cashews are not only crunchy yummies but healthier for you too! OMG...Im soo addicted, I just had to update my review and share!    Another reason for this update is gotta give props to their staff. I swear they are the most cheerful bunch. Patient too. I happen to be there when a couple of customers were giving them a hard time. I had to restrain myself from saying something and strangling them myself!  CZ staff handled the annoying people in stride and with a smile. I sure hope the company takes care of their workers.   If you ever order your salad  to-go, know that they pack your salads nicely, dressing is in a separate container so when you open your container your salad is still crisp.   And if you happen to be there the last few minutes before closing, they offer the desserts at 1/2 off.  Well at least the time I was there they did! Pretty sweet!",

They really make you feel welcome.    I will say I love the grilled pesto chicken sandwich.  It's filled with pesto chicken salad, almonds, red peppers, muenster cheese, sprouts and tomatoes.  Delicious! Their soups are also fantastic.  The Wisconsin cauliflower is probably my favorite even though I do enjoy many of their options.  When I order the choose 2, they give you a whole sandwich and the bowl of soup is huge! Very filling!   I absolutely enjoy eating here.  Delicious food topped with great service. Win Win!",

    "text": "Everything about this place is done with the customer in mind.  I love it!   Ordering is easy - the menu board, while extensive, is clear and big.  There are lots of options here so you'd think you might get lost in it all but the menu is easy to navigate.  You place your order while in line and it's essentially made to order - right in front of you.  They have an awesome selection of sandwiches - hot and cold, hearty and healthy salads, super yummy and nutritious protein bowls and the most amazing soups I've ever had at a non-traditional fast food spot.  There's a display case at the end of the order line just before you pay with the prettiest, yummiest desserts.  Mad props to anyone who can resist one of those yummy treats.   There's plenty of seating and they have a serve yourself drink area with fountain drinks and fresh tea.  I've been here about half a dozen times and whether it's super busy or a complete ghost town inside, the place is always immaculately clean.   I'm partial to the crab avocado melt (minus the bacon) and the lobster bisque soup.  There's not a whole lot I can say about either menu item other than they're just good.  Just damn good!  I combine the sandwich and soup in a \"Try 2\" combo.  It's a lot of food and I don't think I've ever finished the entire thing.   Everything is fresh here - I've never had anything that I thought was old or reheated.  Portions are huge and a super nice touch is the piece of fresh french bread you get with the soup and the chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with every meal.  So good!  So, so, so good!   Cafe Zupas is a super fresh take on your average sandwich shop. There's even a bar area with outlets along the wall so you can plug in your devices (but really, people - can you please put down your damn phone and have a nice meal without any form of electronics?  i dare ya...).  The prices are incredibly reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality of it.   There are locations throughout the valley so no matter where you live, you're not far from a Cafe Zupas.  I really, really recommend it.  Your taste buds will thank you!",

I love that you get a chocolate covered strawberry as a treat!   I tried the Cuban pork sandwich, and it was horrible. It was bland, no flavor, asked for no peppers and they were left on.

The managers are so worried about food cost, they forget the real reason why they are open. I would go to this location about 5 days a week, yes I was a regular.  Their employees recommended me mixing two soups, so that is how I started ordering it. All of a sudden they stopped mixing. This location has rules for everything. Take a step back and be human for a minute. The only good thing they have at the location is their catering / Togo girl, Elizabeth. She truly cares about her customers and goes above and beyond with a smile every single day.  There are other locations that are so much nice and actually care about their customers. The Boca Park location was convenient, but not worth headache, they are so unprofessional. This won't be my last review. I will be going on all social media about this place. Keep up the shitty service!",

    "text": "I've been here numerous times since they first opened and I've started noticing a recent trend. The quantity of ingredients they put in their salads is even less than usual. I understand that places like this usually skimp on \"premium\" ingredients, but this last time was particularly egregious. I ordered a Maui tropical chicken salad and I ended up receiving a lot of lettuce, a couple pieces of chicken, and a few other items that were lost in the greenery.   I asked the employee who was preparing my salad why she dumped all the chicken that she had scooped up back into the container and if I could have a little more rather than the few measly pieces I was given. Her reply was that we level out each scoop and it would be an extra charge. It was clearly below level and all the other ingredients that were put in the salad were below level as well. For example, four tiny pieces of pineapple were put in my salad to give it that \"tropical\" flavor. I mentioned that to the employee and she told me that there was nothing she could do about it. It was just unbelievably petty on their part.   I wish I would've taken a picture, but I was in a rush. Under normal circumstances, I would've politely declined the salad and quietly left. My hunger, however, got the best of me.   The service is still quick, but you get what you pay (over-pay?) for.  This was probably the last time I eat at Cafe Zupas. I can just make my own salads. I can't recommend this place either.",

They have a soup/salad/sandwich bar in which you get to either make your own salad or sandwich - or you get to have one of their recipe specialties.  I absolutely love the Asian Chicken Salad and the Lobster Bisque soup. It is a little pricey, however you're paying for great tasting quality food. I usually spend about $12 for a combo which also includes a drink and chocolate covered strawberry - not bad at all.   If you're ever unsure of which soup you want as there are a lot of great selections, you can try a sample for free! I definitely recommend the lobster bisque soup you get chunks of lobster - so delicious!",

I work customer service and have my bad days so I'm very understanding. Then when he went to order she seemed like she was trying to rush us. Keep in mind there were no people behind us. No people in front of us either. Then she asked my boyfriend a question about his order and he asked her to repeat herself because he didn't hear and was a little confused, and she then got REALLY loud with us. Like rudely loud, and was very attitudey. And not only that she had the nerve to ROLL HER EYES RIGHT AFTER. We are never people to complain, ever, even when the service is not the best. But even my boyfriend got her name because he was so offended by her rudeness. But I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed. I'm very disappointed in my experience the other day...",

I was in the neighborhood today with family, so we were happy to grab lunch.  From the first step inside, everything had changed -- there was only 1 person in line and one other table of patrons.  We weren't greeted upon entry and barely received acknowledgement from most of the staff.  One employee was walking around behind the counter talking about schedules and shifts, wearing a Victoria's Secret Pink brand sweatshirt.  The cashier, a young man, left his station and used his cell phone and then returned and didn't change his gloves.  Then, he took our payment (in the same gloves) and STILL didn't change them after.  Whoever the large girl with glasses is, she has HORRIBLE customer service and seemed bothered when someone ( I assume the supervisor) asked her to work a station.  I then saw here rearrange a full bin of dirty dishes rather than pick the bin up (out of the customer's sight) and take it to the back.  In the past, an employee would walk around, greet you, and see if you needed anything else and offer to take your dish.  NONE of this happened this time.  The employees didn't seem like they cared about anything, even food quality.  I am NOT surprised this location had so few patrons, as they just lost one more today.",

We let the lady behind the counter know we wanted a kale quinoa salad, add chicken, and half a strawberry chicken harvest salad.  Then we moved down the line where sandwiches would have been placed.  We didn't order sandwiches so we shuffled on to the soup section.  I ordered a half tomato basil.  Then came the dessert section before hitting the cash register.  My hubby noticed that there wasn't any chicken on his salad so he let them know right away that he asked for chicken.  So for our meal of full kale quinoa salad with chicken and extra pistachios, a half salad and soup, along with a drink cost us a bit over $20.  I liked my salad, but the soup wasn't a wow as it was creamy and sweet, vs the tartness that I was looking for.  Also, the half salad alone filled me up.  Our meal came with a slice of baguette and choco dipped strawberry.  Overall, I did enjoy the freshness of the salad, the easiness of ordering, and the cleanliness of the spot.  We will return.",

You go thru a line and place your order. If you are not totally prepared for all the questions/options it gets kinda crazy. The food is fantastic. Soups very good. Sands/salads excellent. It can be very crowded but the tables turn over fast. The staff was friendly and helpful. They add to the chaos by working fast and hard to keep the line moving fast. Great job. Great food.

    "text": "I really enjoyed my first experience at Cafe Zupas! The food was fresh and offered a lot of healthy options. They also have a wifi hotspot inside and a recharge station where you can sit, eat lunch and charge ur laptop/devices. Also, I liked the syrups they offer next to the soda machine so u can flavor ur drinks. They give chocolate covered strawberries with every order! Overall, I'm happy with this place and it is ABOUT TIME that we started getting better (by better i mean healthier) food options on this side of Henderson! Nothing but pizzerias and tons of fast food!! This place will do well especially in the hot summer months when a HOT meal just doesn't seem so appetizing! I got the turkey cranberry sandwich. I will be posting pictures of my order along with my fiance's. I really like the turkey cranberry sandwich the honey mustard on the bottom was sweet and not to mustard-y Like some honey mustard's tend to be & I really liked the cranberry sauce on top with the sprouts. Also, I got the chicken chopped salad with blue cheese dressing. My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten the same type of lettuce that my fiance got on his salad instead of the iceberg lettuce they put with mine. There isn't much nutritional value in iceberg lettuce were as he got the deep romaine greens that I would've wanted. Although, I'm sure that if I had known that it came with that type of lettuce I could've asked for the kind that he got. I will make sure to do that next time. All in all this was a great experience and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something that is not deep-fried or saturated in fat. Also, great tasting fresh ingredients!! The ambience of the place wasn't bad either!!! I asked, and they do do call in orders where you can come pick up your food if you like. Good to know. Come check this place out!!",

    "text": "Let me preface by saying that the food here is always good. The reason I rate this as a two is because of the poor service that they have.   First of all, they pretty much just herd you through the line. If you want something special done with your salad (I.e. No wanton strips) you have to communicate that to three different people because they don't care about what you said and they certainly don't want to communicate with one another.   As if that's not bad enough, you have to repeat your order to the person at the cash register because it's obviously too hard for the people working the line to communicate with each other. By this time, you'll have repeated yourself at least three times.   This next part has more to do with my most recent visit to Zupas: I went with my sister. She ordered a salad and I ordered a sandwich. We decided to pay together because she had a gift card and wanted to treat. The cashier rang us up but only put one strawberry on the tray. Upon inquiring why there was not an additional strawberry on the plate, the cashier informed us that she rang it up as a combo because \"it was cheaper that way.\" My sister and I both stated that we never asked for that to be done. I asked if I could just get an additional strawberry. She went to go ask her manager. What?!?  Yes she had to consult her manager over the matter of a strawberry. After the consult was complete, the manager came over and made an adjustment to the bill and said that we owed another dollar for the strawberry. This is the point were I'm seeing that Zupas spent more in labor to ring up the strawberry then it would have cost for them to just put the strawberry on the tray.   Also, I find it offensive when someone tries to manage my pocketbook. Especially when I am not getting what I expect.   I enjoy the Zupas atmosphere and food, but in order to survive, Zupas will need to equip themselves with better customer service. I will be happy to update my review if anything changes.",

    "text": "OMG how have I gone my whole life without this place??   Went on Saturday 12-19-15 about 6PM. This restaurant is on the southeast corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs.  Follow the entrances for sunset station for the easiest entry.    You order right at the counter and they make your food right in front of you.  Order your sammiches and salads first and then scoot on down to the soup area to order yummy soups.  I love their modern trendy decor and the place is so bright and clean! The staff were so cheery and helpful. I like that they do not accept tips AS IT SHOULD BE for counter service.    $27.28 got us two of their \"try two\" combos, two fountain drinks, and a berry creme brulee.  I got the bbq chicken salad and the california turkey sandwich.  Hubs got the tomato soup and the ultimate grilled cheese.  Both meals came with a slice of baguette and a chocolate-covered strawberry.   BBQ chicken salad comes with House-Chopped Mixed Greens, House-Made Ranch Dressing, Chicken*, BBQ Sauce, Red Onions, Grape Tomatoes, Fire Roasted Corn, Black Olives, Black Beans, & Tortilla Strips.  I love that the salad came already dressed and the lettuce to toppings ratio was perfect.   The california turkey sandwich comes with Turkey, Avocado, Tomatoes, Sprouts, Cucumbers, Mixed Greens, Muenster Cheese, & House-Made Sun-Dried Tomato Herb Spread.  I asked for honey mustard instead of the tomato herb spread and they were happy to oblige.  I love that they have sprouts because I haven't seen many places that have them.   The creme brulee did not have a rich and decadent taste at all...it was more like a vanilla pudding.  I think next time I'll try the chocolate one.    Their drink fountains have a ton of choices and they have about 6 syrups in different flavors to spice up your drink.  There were some cute recipes printed right on the cups.    I want to try everything on the menu!!!!",

We told him that we were dining in but they were reluctant when we kept on trying to insist that we were dining in but they gave us paper plates anyways. The staff would rather talk to each other and goof around then look towards the paying customers I felt very neglected going there and I had a terrible time overall. And even more we love their bread and strawberries but we asked them multiple times and it took several times prompting them to even give us one. The food is still good but the employees just need to be trained more on their etiquette.",

The problem was when it came down to ordering we ordered a strawberry harvest and a crab sandwich and jewels was the person who helped us but made the entire experience uncomfortable/horrible. I don't think we're ever going back because all I did was ask her to wrap the sandwich and she sighed really loud and rolled her eyes. I don't understand how that's an inconvenience if you're getting paid to do this. If you don't like where you're at I would assume that they would be looking for another job? We paid almost $30 for our meal and id rather waste that somewhere else because I don't want to come to an establishment where I'll get constant glares and eye rolls over simple requests. Not only that but when we finished paying I heard her mumble more stuff under her breath. The only reason I didn't ask for a manager was because I didn't want to make a scene so I'd rather put it on here.",

    "text": "I'm liking Cafe Zupas. Where else can you get quality sandwiches, salads and soups? Well, probably lots of other places. But there is something about Cafe Zupas that I draws me back.   No, I don't come here frequently. Maybe once every few months or so. But in those visits I always get something different. I always go with a choose two combo but which two I get changes from time to time. A sandwich and a salad. A sandwich and a soup. A salad and soup. And so many varieties. I like to switch it up.   I've tried their tomato soup with orzo pasta added in. That is good. But for as far as soups go, I love their mushroom bisque. It is creamy rich and loaded with a fresh blend of mushrooms. The fried onions I had them sprinkle on top were fine but didn't add anything. Next time soup free of additions will do.   As for the sandwiches, I've had the chicken pesto a couple of times and the Cuban once. Both are good but I think the Cuban is my favorite of the two. I want to try another sandwich next time I go. Which I try will be a mystery until that next visit. I always take a few minutes to decide before I order. Its all just too good.  To end the meal here, Cafe Zupas gives you a chocolate dipped strawberry. Maybe thats the real reason I like this place so much. Its the cherry, er, strawberry on top.",

When I went up to the counter and man in a blue shirt greeted me i think his name was Rory or rorie and he greeted me and my husband. When we were ordering he rushed our entire order and was talking in our mouths about the seasonal item that had come out and was pointing to the glass, we kindly said no and tried to continue our order, I was going to order a soup but as I was speaking he said  \"You can get that soup down the line\" which I didn't mind but the tone of voice he said it with was down right rude. Then he glided my salads over and while he was doing so my salad was poured all over the box and my dressing was thrown right onto the salad and without a \"thank you\" continued to help other costumers and when I was watching my salad he made he had repeated \"if you'd like a soup you can get it down the line\" so now I can't watch my salad be made?? And I'm guessing he was the manager because he had on a different shirt then the regular employees. This was the most horrible service I've gotten in a while, I know I take a little bit longer than other costumers but your job is to help me especially if you are a manager. I'm sad to say I will not be returning and I will be telling my company who orders with them not to order as well because the way they treat their customers is down right wrong. Lots of the ladies in there seemed nice but he has ruined my experience. My first and LAST time coming here.",

Also, the salad came with a piece of French bread and every meal gets you a chocolate dipped strawberry apparently. They have an Italian soda station that is included with your beverage purchase. 3 different kinds if cake like brownines/bars and their chocolate hazelnut creme brulee looks tasty too. It was clean, service was quick and props to the lady clearing tables! She did a fantastic job turning them over and handling customers' trays at the garbage can after!",

First the asiago crostini I added for .59 to my soup was so stale I could barely chew it. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich as well. It would of been decent if the turkey wasn't the cheap honey kind that tastes like ham. Blegh. I did enjoy the lobster bisque soup. Glad one thing was edible. I'm giving 2 stars, 1 for soup and 1 for service.",

They will offer you extra shredded cheese on top but don't pay it. Not necessary. It is already super cheesy goodness! I have to say the chicken enchilada chili soup is WONDERFUL!!!! If I got that alone it would be easy 5 stars. The salad was good tasting, super fresh and all BUT there was too much BBQ dressing so near the end it got to be really sweet. Also I had to send it back just as I sat down as I ordered it with no onions, I heard the girl repeat it to the girl making the salad but onions still were on it. I'm allergic to onions so can't eat that like it was. My friend got the \"Try 2\" option also. He got the Yucatan chicken tortilla soup. This is very onion-y, brothy but he said it was ok. Although he didn't finish it so I know it wasn't great. He also got the Nuts About Berries salad. He loved it and I loved it as well. I had to try it. He would definitely get that again. Overall, very friendly staff, we will definitely go back.",

In my opinion, they beat out the other soup & salad place in the neighborhood, Sweet Tomatoes. Sure, it isn't an AYCE buffet of sub-par soups and other just-okay finger foods... but anything you order here is sure to get you your fill!  They have a menu that seems to change often and according to the season. The last time I went - which was almost 2 weeks ago - I ordered their chicken pesto sandwich with a generous portion bowl of wild mushroom bisque. Both so good! They also had a bunch of other colorful, yummy-looking salads and several vegetarian options to choose from. I had a hard time deciding! Although I think any route I could've taken would've been a good one.  Their service is also great. I was greeted immediately upon arrival and they were very patient as I decided what to order. I noticed that the lady behind me was super rude... I felt bad! But the employee handled it very graciously. Kudos to them!  Anyway, if you're in the area, I highly suggest trying Zupas! You'll love it.",

It was pretty crowded when I came during lunch but it passes by quickly enough.   I had the clam chowder and chicken pesto sandwich. The clam chowder was lacking in flavor unfortunately. I tried my friend's mushroom soup and I was impressed from the start with it. The chicken pesto sandwich is pretty good as well! Nothing to complain about. Lunch also comes with a cute chocolate-covered strawberry!    I'll be back whenever I crave sandwiches and soup for sure!",

    "text": "I got take out from here today and based on the service and given how excited I was about the food, I was ready to give a solid 4-star review. It was a little chaotic and loud in there, but employees were efficient and friendly.   And then I got home and opened my sandwich and was like whaaaat? It was SO small. Maybe it wasn't really all that small but it was in a really big box which maybe made it look smaller. Even if the bread wasn't small, the sandwiches are verrrrry thin with not a whole lot of filling.   I had the crab avocado melt and was so disappointed to find they use imitation crab. I suppose I should have expected that since places that serve real crab tend to advertise as such, but the description says \"House-Made New England Crab Salad, Avocado, Bacon, Celery, Red Onions, Tomatoes, & Muenster Cheese\" - nowhere does it say they use imitation crab. It was about half as thick as the image on the website.   I had the clam chowder soup, which had good thick chunks of potato, but was more watery than I like. The container was not full.   When my boyfriend opened his box with his turkey bacon avocado sandwich, he literally said \"what? it's so small!\" He finished it in just a few bites.   I am happy to pay a little extra for fresh, real ingredients, even with small serving sizes, which is why I'm not saying anything like \"Boy, 5 bucks sure goes a lot farther at Subway!\" However, if I'm going to pay that little extra, they should at least warn you about the imitation crab!",

Well I can take the third option off that list because tonight I witnessed, Cafe Zupas, the fast food salad phenom. This place really surprised me, the decor is bright and futuristic and they even have cell phone charging stations!!   The setup there is a reverse cafeteria style. You walk-up, place your order, head down the line and they do the rest...easy-peasy lemon squeezy. Definitely mention to the staff if you don't want certain things on your salad or sandwich because they will prepare them with the works!  They offer multiple salad, soup, and sandwich options, which you can mix and match if you so desire. I ordered the Honey Chipotle Chicken salad with a bowl of Wild Mushroom bisque, be still my beating heart! The salad was prepared fresh, from the chicken to the dressing and all the veggies. Plus the soup would have knocked my socks off, if I was wearing some. Summer in Vegas = No sock days.   If you still have room, they have an amazing dessert display: brownies, cheesecake and some type of marshmallow, coconut concoction. I passed, It was tough, but I stayed strong. From ordering, to eating, we were out the door in just about 30 minutes; just like I like it when I'm on the go!",

It was sweet and tangy with a generous amount of chicken in it.  I also had the Cuban Grilled Pork sandwich, and it tasted good too.  In the past, I've tried the soups which are delicious, and my favorite is definitely the wild mushroom bisque.  The chicken enchilada soup and lobster bisque are good but a little bit too salty for my tasty.  Overall, Cafe Zupas is a great restaurant for healthy food.  I do wish the restaurant would adopt a new system for ordering.  You first order your soup, salad, and/or sandwich at the beginning of the line and continue moving down to the cash register, while different workers ask if there are any add ons to your order.  The problem with this system is once I get to the cash register to pay for my food, it always seems disorganized as workers are trying to sort out plates of food and figure out which order belongs to which customer.  I prefer this place to Panera since the prices are more reasonable for the portion sizes.  The choose two combo comes with bread, a chocolate covered strawberry (every order comes with this), a whole sandwich, and either a half salad or half soup for under $9.00.",

Not to mention the freebies and half price days they randomly offer.  I loved this place when I first tried it about a year ago, but now they're close to work, home and its a healthier option for the entire family.  The 16 year old boy can get pulled pork, and the 12 year old (who went vegetarian overnight) can eat plenty without meat. Not to mention 8 different soups. I was sold at that. I love soup, and even when its 110 in Vegas, I still will eat soup. They also change up the flavors with the seasons, or popularity. (So don't get hooked on one item)  My favorite part, they appreciate their people. They close on Sundays so everyone can have a family day.  With good food, decent prices, a great people- Cafe Zupas is a win win in my book!",

The new location is open at Stephanie/Sunset and is easily accessible.  There are 2 entrances (front and back) and plenty of parking.  We parked in the front and entered the restaurant.    They offer paper menus and have a large menu board.  Small signs explain how to order.  You start with salads, then sandwiches and end with soups. They offer a special which includes a sandwich and either a half salad or half bowl of soup for $8.99. Seems like a great deal.  My Mom and I hadn't eaten and decided to share a little of everything.  We got the chipotle chicken salad (full size), turkey artichoke and spinach sandwich and a half bowl of lobster bisque.  With 2 drinks, our bill was about $20 and this was A LOT of food.  In hindsight, we should have just ordered the half salad, because we didn't even come close to eating everything!  Meals are served with a slice of yummy bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  Both were delicious!j  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The service was really quick as well.

I also ordered the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup which was a lot better than the salad. You so get a free chocolate covered strawberry with your order. Don't skip out on the water drinks. I had the green tea one which was amazing! I had to deduct a star because the cheese in the salad was weird and you shouldn't be charged to add a teaspoon of onions.

I'll let the other reviewers like Shirley B go in depth on the joys of the Asian Citrus Chicken Salad, or the Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup which I am addicted to. I have explored about 75% of their menu and haven't found anything that I didn't like here.   I call this a failsafe choice because when my family gets sick and nothing else sounds good, Cafe Zupas soups are what we fall back on. Their Wisconsin Cheddar is our all time favorite, but my son will eat the Tomato Soup with Orzo when he won't eat anything else.   You would be amiss if you walked out of here without a piece of cheesecake, but the strawberries dipped in Belgian Chocolate that come with every meal are a treat all to themselves. I've walked in here at 9:45 pm with a large order more than once and have always received service with smiles...and I love that. In short, you can't go wrong giving Cafe Zupas a try.",

I finally got to enjoy a meal there today and it was terrific.    I love the choose 2 option (choose any 2 from 1/2 salad, 1/2 soup, whole sandwich).  I especially love the chicken pesto sandwich. My favorite salad is Nuts About Berries - the lettuce is so crisp and fresh and the berries are ripe and flavorful. I switch out the poppyseed dressing with red raspberry vinaigrette and it's total sweet perfection. You get a baguette with your salad and you can top off your meal with an included sweet treat - a chocolate covered strawberry. They have some more desserts available for purchase but I haven't tried them yet.   The service here is way above and beyond. These people are so friendly and helpful. There's always someone waiting to greet you and offer suggestions or answer questions at the front door. They are extremely flexible if you want to make changes to the menu options. The food is ready so quickly after ordering. And all of this fantastic service is just because... they don't accept tips. The restaurant is bright and spacious with plenty of tables and large booths, and a charging station.   My only wish for this place is a whole wheat bread option for sandwiches and baguettes. This is one of my favorite food spots in the area and can't wait to try all of the options on the menu! Still completely giddy over you, CZ! Welcome to the neighborhood.",

I prefer the chicken enchilada chili bc it's very tasty and s little lower calorie than my second two favs the Wisconsin cheddar and the mushroom bisque. I always get the \"try two\" combo or whatever it's called here, you can pick sandwich, soup or salad, but the nice part here compared to Panera is that the portions seem bigger, e.g. you get a full sandwich instead of a half sandwich. I've switched from getting sandwich to getting salad, personal fave is protein cobb but the wife loves the quinoa or the strawberry harvest. My favorite new addition is the drink bar, a nice alternative to cokes/colas when you are trying to convince yourself you're eating healthy.

They were rushing around all stressed out... almost forgot to give a lady a box with the strawberries and bread. Wasn't seven that busy for them to look crazy. Relax y'all ;-)",

(Especially packed during lunch, but don't worry, there are plenty of seats!)  The selection of soups is pretty diverse (I love the Garden Chowder!) and even the half portions that I get with my sandwich are more than enough when I'm hungry. The hardest decision you make is which pair you would like to get (soup and salad? Salad and a sandwich? Etc).   The sweetest thing is that with every soup you get a roll of bread to dip, and with every order you get a chocolate dipped strawberry that is a perfect treat to end your meal! But if you'd like more, there is a variety of desserts you can choose from that are displayed before you pay!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying the food is great however; i ordered a childs meal not because I want to be cheap but because I have had gastric sleeve and I can not consume what a normal person consumes.  I cant even consume a full kids meal.  So I go in with my husband he orders an adult 2 combo meal with sandwich and soup and I order soup and fruit combo.  The kids meal comes with a drink, and covered strawberry with my two items and was not sure what else but it was less food then an adult combo.  We pay for our meal and we go sit down.  I notice there is 2 rolls , 2 covered strawberries , our 2 items each and a drink.   I eat part of my soup and picked out 3 half grapes and I was full so I couldn't even finish the kids meal and since I cant eat and drink at the same time my husband had my drink.   I look at my receipt and I see they charged me correctly for my husbands meal and my kids meal however there is an extra $2.00 adult charge so I went up to the counter to ask what is this charge.  I am told that when an adult orders a kids meal they upgrade the drink from small to large and they give you a biscuit with the meal to give you more food.  Now reminder I didn't want more food if that was the case I would of ordered an adult meal I wanted small portion so I ordered a kids meal.   So now I just got charged for a large drink that they thought to upgrade for me without asking and they gave me a biscuit I didn't ask for cause they thought cause I was an adult I needed more food.  I explained to the girl I order kids meal cause if she looked at my food they served me I didn't even finish the soup nor did I make a dent in the fruit so why would I want a biscuit that I cant even consume and a larger drink was not needed or requested but they charged me extra for stuff I didn't ask for.   I will never go to Cafe Zupas again if this is how they are going to practice business.  I even offered to show my surgery card to show I can't consume large portion and to allow me to order from childs meal/senior meal portions.    Bad business practice Cafe Zupas.  I should of been asked if I wanted the extras I would of told her NO.  So instead I paid for food I ended up throwing away cause I didn't order it nor could I consume it.",

I have a special card from my doctor asking that I be allowed to order from the kids menu (since most places have an age limit). I asked for a kids meal and they said that I could order one but that it would cost me more because I'm an adult. What?! I didn't get extra food. The portions weren't bigger. It was the exact same as a regular kids meal but I had to pay 3 dollars more! It's totally stupid because I couldn't even eat the entire meal.

We thought enough time has gone by that we should give it another chance, since their salads look so good on their website menu.  What a waste of our time!  We ordered a large protein Cobb salad which barely looked anything like the one on their website.  It was just under $8, which is way overpriced for what amounted to what would be a small side salad at most places.  Also ordered a large bowl of chicken enchilada chili.  Without stirring up the pot, the server dished out two scoops of broth from the top of the pot which had none of the beans, chicken or corn settled on the bottom.  When this was mentioned, the server said we didn't have to get it if we didn't want it.  We spoke with a manager and ended up getting a refund and leaving.  Sorry there's no picture.  The manager scurried the salad away as fast as she could when my husband tried to get a picture of it.  My husband made me promise to NEVER try this place again.  An easy promise to keep!",

Their dessert is amazing, however, if you do the pick two option they give you a chocolate strawberry and a slice of French bread to go with it. Their drink bar is amazing. I mix two pumps of strawberry syrup with half cup of light lemonade and sprite - it's amazing! I love the Cuban sandwich - it's my absolute favorite. The Cobb salad is pretty good and their red pepper lobster soup is out of this world! Also the soup goes really well with their croutons that you can add just for $0.69. You also have the option to create your own salad and sandwich. This place is closed on Sunday's so make sure to get your cafe zupas fix Monday through Saturday!!!",

I'm assuming it was itchy. That's a health code violation. So finally he took it off and scratched his head. Took off the gloves. Thankfully. Only one girl looked like she was working. Poor girl. Taylor was very disorganized. Gave away my salad to another customers. I had to wait for them to make me another. My sandwich was put on a plate at first even though my order was to go.

For some reason my meal came with a chocolate dipped strawberry for dessert, which exactly what someone normally craves after a hearty clam chowder.

Came here two weeks ago with a friend and the place was packed. Lines almost outside the door. And the sitting area was almost full. There are signs here just as they are at the Eastern location that state you will never have to hold a table, seats are always available.  Well, after we ordered our food and headed to take a seat. Guess what? No seats available. Shocker. Grant it, this has never happened at the Eastern location but I always wondered if it did occasionally happen. And yes, it does. Luckily a group of four ladies were kind enough to give us there table as they had already finished eating and were just sitting down having a chat afterwards.  The food was spot on from the Eastern location. This has to be the best gourmet sandwich shop in town now. Totally has me hooked and here more so than Panera Bread. Just be forewarned that seating here is darn near impossible and the layout is a little weird. There's a wall that houses the fountain drink area and a small squeeze through spot to a sitting area there that if you're not careful, you'll run into someone trying to make your way over to grab your soda before you sit. I wonder how many accidents have happened because of this?",

Even the drink station was terrific with some different options like ginger ale on tap. I had a sprite zero with some Italian soda raspberry syrup, which are free for use too. My wife opted for coke with vanilla syrup. Round out the meal with a chocolate dipped strawberry, and you have to give five stars...",

I am a vegetarian and their vegetarian sandwich was probably the best one I've had in a really long time. It was a cold sandwich with sprouts, cucumbers, tomato and a homemade basil pesto. My wife had a chicken mango salad and it was pretty awesome as well. The staff was very friendly and inviting. The BEST part of the meal was the Berry Creme Brulee. They make all their dressings in house and desserts every morning. Definitely worth trying.",

Alexis displays all the negative stereotypes of the rude, entitled Millenial. She said that the bacon comes that way and the strawberries are complimentary. She just couldn't grasp the idea that an unappetizing (and I am being kind) plate ruins the experience of the whole meal. She continued to be rude and made a deragatory noise and gave me a dirty look. I never asked for refund, just that they realize how bad it was. It is very sad, this place used to be a favorite!",

She never does come back to help me, after a few minutes of me standing there and looking irritated, another girl finally comes up and asks what she can get me... the manager girl continues her list then tells the prep cook to make two batches of something and do it quick... even though it has a lot of ingredients (her words) when she is done she precedes to make a salad wearing the same gloves that she just took a marker out of her personal jean pocket with, and touched every item.. GROSS!!! I proceeded through the rest of the line without issue. The food was to-go, I get home, soup was very disappointing both were extremely watered-down and potatoes were undercooked... maybe they should not try and hurry when making their products! Ordered a million dollar bar... did not see it till I got home... it literally was 4 bites!!! I guess they are really going for a \"million dollar bar\". They used to be so big!   All I can say is corporate send help!!!",

Normally, I hate \"cafeteria style\" restaurants because the lines are slow and it can be frustrating to navigate, but Zupas makes the process easy. There is one employee per section and they make sure that the line goes fast with always friendly service. You're also free to sample stuff if you're on the fence about what to choose. The only downside about their system is sometimes they get orders confused and that really holds up the line, but that rarely happens.  The menu is pretty big and there's lots of healthy options. I love the variety of salads that they have available and I have yet to try a salad that I don't like. Their soups are really good too. The sandwiches are hit or miss. My chicken pesto sandwich was swimming in cheese and missing the pesto that I was craving. They also have an awesome selection of desserts and house made drinks.   The prices are cheap if you take into consideration the portion sizes and quality of food. You just can't beat it. Just go!",

As the name implies, we've been able to find a nice variety of soups that have been good to me, and more importantly, to my daughter. Pair the soup with a salad or a sandwich and you'll find yourself enjoying a nice meal.  Most of the employees are younger, but we've experienced no problems and they have been always been quite friendly quick to assist or answer any questions. Once you order you sandwich or salad, you can move on down the line to order your soup, then finally you can look over the dessert case to top of your meal with something sweet, or you can finish with the always pleasing chocolate covered strawberry.  The soups, salads, and sandwiches are fresh and made to order, not much more you ask for there. Aside from the aforementioned items, you can also opt to have a quinoa protein bowl. I haven't had any of the salads, but have sampled most of the soups and sandwiches. There's plenty of variety in their selection where you'll most discover something of you're liking. You can't go wrong with the Italian Club with salami, ham, turkey, and balsamic served on Ciabatta. As far as soups, I go for the Wisconsin Cauliflower topped with bacon and cheese.  We have no problems with pricing and we can usually get away paying for a meal for three for $10-$12 per person. Regardless, if my daughter's teeth are sore or not, we have a solid option for soup/salad/sandwich combos.",

One tip is that if you get the combo you get a free chocolate covered strawberry included in your meal! It's not a small one either.  My favorite soup has to be the garden chowder!

Although it's more of a \"quick service\" type of eatery, the sandwiches are good (I recommend the honey bacon club), the soups are piping hot (lobster bisque and wild mushroom are amazing!), and the salads are fresh and tasty (the strawberry fields salad is wonderful).  The staff here are friendly and helpful, and you can even request samples of the soup before committing (who does that anymore!?!). They have small desserts and the creme brulee is pretty tasty, too.",

I have decided that I'm going to try all the sandwiches on the menu and write a review so today I ordered the crab avocado club and the lobster bisque. I'm not gonna lie the lobster bisque I have everytime it is so good and creamy It's my favorite. I have sampled others but I will drive there just to get the lobster bisque. So on to the sammich it's a house made New England crab salad , avocado, bacon , celery , red onion, tomatoes and muenster cheese. And it is delicious ! The tomato gives it a fresh taste Must try if you love seafood like me :)",

The soup tasted good but I didn't feel so well shortly afterwards.  I emailed Cafe Zupas asking them for the list of ingredients in the soup which \"Jen\" refused to share.  Evidently, Cafe Zupas is not the least bit concerned about people who have food allergies.  I explained to her that I am sensitive to dairy products and she directed me to their website that states 'cream'.  No mention of any other dairy ingredients.  Also, states \"special herbs\".  I guess they must mean marijuana, right?  I mean, what else could it possible be since there is no such thing as a \"special herb\"???  Needless to say, I will not be returning to this restaurant when they don't believe in transparency with their ingredients.",

They should consider looking into improving their vegetarian sandwiches.  I don't really get why we can't tip the servers? Especially if they're responsible to clean up the slop people leave behind? I felt bad and put my own dishes away. Why make someone do waiter/waitress tasks and not pay them correctly for it.",

The sandwich was ok, but nothing about which to write home.  The chowder, however, was a different story. Peppery, creamy, rich, with a deep smoky flavor; it may be the best thing I've ever eaten. Seriously, if there was only one bowl of it left on Earth, and Sofia Vergara told me she would have sex with me in exchange for it, I'd tell her to piss off. I'm sitting here, staring at the last droplets in my bowl, wondering if the other dinners would notice if I just stuck my face in the bowl and started licking. I would sell a testicle for more of this. Fortunately, they take amex, so it won't come to that, yet. I never understood addiction until today.

It used to be a once in while treat for my wife and me, since the nearest location was all the way over on Eastern, but once they opened up this location, we were done for.  The food quality is always fresh and everything tastes wonderful.  With the introduction of their new salads, they have truly pushed things to the next level.   The Asian Citrus Chicken salad, the MangoBerry, and the balsamic salads are my favorites.  For soups, the Chicken chili, and especially the Chicken Tortilla, are amazing.  The only issue we've ever encountered is when there are more guys working behind the counter.  For some reason, they are never as efficient and quick as when it's an all  girl staff.  My wife swears that this is because women multi-task better and, well, that's not something I'm willing to argue.  Even when it's not at its best, the service is still leaps and bounds better than most places.  The desserts are also tasty.  The creme brulee, while not being REAL creme brulee, is still a nice treat.  The dessert bars are always tempting but, unfortunately, they all contain nuts.  So if you're one of those poor suckers like me who can't have nuts, you're SOL for most of the desserts.  And, of course, the chocolate covered strawberries are a perfect after dinner sweet.  There's enough variety here that I feel like I could eat here every night of the week.  Combined with the smiling employees and the reasonable prices, this place will always be a win in my book.",

The veggie sandwich is so small it's a joke. They basically put salad ingredients between two thick pieces of bread. I don't get it. How about sliced tomatoes and veggies? They also put too much pesto on it to the point where it ends up soggy & all I can taste is the pesto. The salads are not bad but they don't have very healthy options unless you choose to build your own salad. The desserts are actually pretty good. Soups are good and come with a bit of bread which is nice. But most soups are cream based so, again, not very healthy.   Service: What is terrible is they make you repeat your order over and over again. There is no communication between the people that put your order together and the person who rings you up. Hey, Zupas, there is technology now that allows you to enter an order through something called a computer. A lot of other businesses use them. Staff is always nice but I don't want to repeat my order so many times.   Get it together if you want my business on the regular. Serve better portions of veggies instead of just slathering everything in dressing. Create a more efficient and convenient way to order.",

Enough salad dressing for two salads, lobster bisque soup had no lobster but had a ton of tomato so it was more Tomato bisque.

Yesterday I noticed that the menu has changed drastically.  I used to get the kale and quinoa salad like it was a religion.  Yesterday it wasn't in the menu so ended up getting something similar to it.  The tomato basil soup is vey good as well.  Skipped the bread as usual and desert.  Zupas is always clean and the staff behind the counter runs like a well oiled machine.",

First of all, I had no idea this place existed u til my classmate recommended it - and now I'm doing you the favor of recommending it back! Do you like fresh hand-made salads? Do you like packed sandwiches? Do you like fresh, hearty soups - full of flavor? Cafe Zupas is the place for you!   Cafe Zupas has such a cool concept; you basically walk in, \"pick & point\" and the person on the other side of the counter builds your order. For salads they build your bowl accordingly; for soups, they are already freshly made and the sandwiches? These babies get pressed to perfection!   Today I was privileged to try the BBQ chicken salad in a half size. The half size was super filling and at less than $7 for a big bowl of salad - I was completely satisfied!   If you haven't tried Cafe Zupas? What are you waiting for? Come in and give this place a try!",

I chose the half serving of the California Cobb Salad with chicken and ranch dressing. I paired the salad with a salmon chowder--ironically it was the last day they were serving it as it was seasonal I was told. I chose ice tea for my beverage. The meals come with yummy crusty bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  My daughter ordered a regular size California Cobb Salad with Turkey and lemonade. My husband ordered a barbecued pulled pork and New England Clam Chowder with Root Beer. My son didn't order because he ate Taco Bell his favorite before we went to Cafe Zupas. The restaurant was clean and brightly lit. The employees were friendly. The manager waited on us and thanked us for coming in.  The food was delicious, tasty and fresh. Every bite of my salad was marvelous! Most everything they serve is healthy. My daughter enjoyed her salad as well.  If you're looking for a good place to eat: I recommend trying Cafe Zupas--you can't go wrong and they have something for everyone. We were to full for dessert, but maybe next time.",

Bowls are a fun way to eat and looked enticing (we will try on our next visit).

    "text": "We visit this location all the time as it's good food for a quick bite and close to our home. We were just in tonight and ordered takeout for a party of 5, spent $55. Mind you, I am willing to spend whatever for good food! However, I will not spend even $5 for food if I am going to get attitude from the employees! I am also a business owner and would never myself or allow my staff to treat customers rudely, even if it is the customers mistake. What happened to the customer is always right? That is how I have trained my staff for the last 18 years as an employer.  So now to the story, I ordered a TBA with salad, everything was fine until I looked up at the menu board again and noticed it came with honey mustard (I am allergic to honey). I advised the order taker that I did not want honey mustard. She turned around to (Jules or Jewels - not sure of spelling) and asked if she had already made it, to which she replied she had. The order taker asked if I wanted them to remake it and I replied yes. This is where the attitude starts - Jules immediately has an annoyed look on her face, rolls her eyes, and says under her breath oh my god! Wtf? Are you kidding me!?!  It was definitely my mistake but seriously, you are going to roll your eyes and start mumbling under your breath. From that point forward until we finished paying, every time I looked at Jules, she would give me the ugliest glare! That's when I asked the cashier (who was very friendly) for her name. It seems as glancing through previous reviews, I am certainly not the only one who has had issues with rudeness of some of the staff at this location.   I would suggest the franchisee be a little more selective on whom they hire, as this is costing you customers.   Please don't reply back with your standard verbiage that you will forward to your operations team for complaints on Yelp, as clearly the company does not care if the employees are rude since this has been going on for quite some time according to these reviews. There are several other soup, sandwich, and salad restaurants in the area that are just as good without the attitude!",

Everyone is always friendly and the service is quick, as it's assembly line style. Their portions are pretty big; I almost always have leftovers.

This review is not a reflection of their food, it is a reflection of their service. I would also like to add that I can be a little high maintenance with food (remove this, add that) but I have always understood that I may be charged extra for this. I have never minded paying extra because I like my food the way I like it. So if you're like me and like to customize your order a little, don't bother with this location.   When I'm in the mood for a sandwich I always get the turkey bacon club. I always order it the same way; remove tomatoes and add three cheese artichoke spread. When I asked the attendant for this she told me that they couldn't do that because they only add bacon or avocados to sandwiches. I informed her that I get the sandwich this way every time I order this and have never had a problem before at this location or any location. She seemed very surprised by this and said that they still wouldn't allow me to add the spread. I also informed her that if they needed to charge me extra for the artichoke spread, I didn't mind. She told me that per management she couldn't do that. I asked to speak to the  manager and when I did, I requested he charge me for the spread so I can have my sandwich the way I'd like. They were not willing to put the spread on the sandwich. The attendant and the manager were not rude to me when we were discussing this but I'm still very unhappy with this situation. I don't understand why any management team would not charge for the extra item and add it in. It's not as though they're losing money. It is very dissatisfying for the customer. After thanking them for their time, I left without purchasing anything.",

    "text": "Let's start with the outstanding. Cafe Zupas soups are REALLY, really good - Wisconsin Cauliflower, Mushroom Bisque, Chicken Tortilla, Garden Chowder - they will keep you coming back. Craving a quick soup in the hot Vegas desert? - This is where you go, way better than Whole Foods, etc..  But - whatever you do, never, ever order anything else..  The prepared 'salads' are an embarrassment to seeds and soil. Your 'tropical salad' will be  canned pineapple, canned corn and tinny-tasting mandarin sections over papery shredded romaine. The dressings taste like cleaning products. The avocado 'protein substitute' (for salad chicken) is a marble-sized dollop of tasteless green mush. The sandwiches are even worse. Imagine the nastiest, solution-injected fast-food chicken cutlet you've ever seen. Well you'll beg for one when you taste the spongy pulp they're serving at Zupas. The bread is awful too, how can bread be an afterthought at a soup restaurant? Has anyone here ever actually eaten any of this 'food'?  But again, the soups are divine. Inner turmoil!  A note on service - walking into a Zupas is like getting subbed into a high school girls' indoor volleyball game. You're screeched at from the moment you enter, by well meaning but irritating girls who look at you from behind Stockholm Syndrome eyes that cry out - 'sorry but they're making me do this'...   \"Hello welcome to Zupas is this your first time with us! Can I help you to understand our menu today! Well then what can I get for ya! So no salad, just soup then! Would you like to add bacon, cheddar or fried onions to that! No other add-ons then! And just the one soup! Would you like to add dessert or any beverages! (slide down the line, new girls...) OK, so what did you order! Which soup was yours! And was that all for you today! Would you like to try any of our desserts!!  Somewhere the corporate bloodticks who are drilling these poor girls on upselling is probably pleased with the environment they've created. Me? I'm buying noise-canceling headphones and a neck sign for my next visit that reads:  'Lost my hearing in a Cafe Zupas takeout line last month. Please prepare for me a large cauliflower soup to go. No, nothing else. Yes, I'm quite sure. Thank you'.",

    "text": "I come in here fairly often, but coming in earlier was a different story. Usually staff is pretty friendly, even though they are a little rushy towards customers when you walk in. I came in during a little bit of a rush for my lunch break from my school nearby, and waited in line until I got to the front where you order salads or sandwiches. I ordered my sandwich and wanted soup that day, so I waited in line until I got to soups.   The first person in the ordering line with a green shirt whose name tag I caught said Taryn, was showing absolute poor professionalism to one of her co-workers in a black shirt whose name I didn't catch. The way she was speaking to her co-worker in front of customers and their other co-workers was like she was humiliating her. It was as if she was showing her or telling her to do something but in a satirical, mocking way. It was completely unprofessional. The smug look on her face showed that she knew what she was doing. The poor girl looked like it was really bothering her, but still continued to smile and ask how I was. I wanted to say something for her to the bully in the green!   I am a student nurse and I have compassion for others. Yes they have good food and good service to customers, but treating your staff poorly is enough for me to stop going to this location. And if I see it at another, I would happily stop going here altogether. Looking back at it now, I wish I would have spoken to a manager. Or if that woman was the manager, spoken to someone higher. You can't even tip the kids cleaning up trash and checking on you - that's sad and is a poor reflection on the culture. Terrible.  Treat your employees with respect, we can see and hear you and my classmates (who eat here as much as I do), agree with me. We will be returning to another location!",

    "text": "Its great to see a alternative to Panera Bread popping up around town.   Some friends and I decided to stop by Zupas not too long ago and it was a pretty good experience. The food offerings are simply a variety of salads, soups and flatbread panini sandwiches. There are tons of options and virtually anything can be customized. Quality wise the food has always been fresh and step above similar fast food spots. The chicken tortilla soup, pulled pork sandwich and bbq ranch chicken salad have been consistent crowd pleasers.    Every meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry which can contribute as to why this place is so popular with the ladies. The menu rotates seasonally so there is plenty of variety and reason to come in regularly. I did notice the portions are pretty small, I could easily eat two of their paninis in one sitting. Also Zupas is closed on Sunday which I found out the hard way so diners beware. Overall a pretty decent experience and worth a second trip.",

I had the Honey Bacon Club and the Chicken Tortilla soup and it was delicious. Plus they give you a chocolate strawberry at the end. Can't go wrong with that!  The facility was very well kept as well. Everything was clean and the staff was very friendly. I'd definitely recommend for a quick and easy lunch.",

    "text": "I should start by saying I am not a huge fan of sandwich and soup places and can be a little on the judgey side as I usually hold them to a pretty high standard.   I have been to this location twice at the request of a friend wanting to go.  The restaurant itself is very clean, bright in nature and pretty modern.  They have a charging station so you can bring your laptop in and work while you enjoy a meal.  The soda station they have is also unique as they have different syrups located right next to the machine.  One thing  I really enjoyed was they had saltine crackers.  A weird thing to mention, I know, but for some reason I enjoy a restaurant that has saltine crackers. no rhyme or reason to my madness.    As for the sandwiches: I first tried a Cuban sandwich there and did not enjoy it.   Just not a lot of flavor very little pickle and mustard.  The soup I had was good but average.  I believe it was the Wisconsin cheddar one.   After my first experience I was not going to give it another try but my friend convinced me.  The second sandwich I had was much better and bumped it up to three stars for me.  It was the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich.  They carnitas were pretty juicy and the slaw on top had a good cilantro flavor.  I could taste the sweetness of the Honey and it was a very welcomed addition.   A fun thing you get with every meal is a chocolate covered strawberry.",

I had a crab and avocado panini-like sandwich and a small bowl of your traditional (Friday) clam chowder. It was  a great combo. I also had a chocolate hazelnut pudding for desert and was great too. For all I had, it was about your typical price of $12. I went back a few weeks later and had an excellent bowl  of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich.",

Everything was there until I noticed, THERE WAS NO TURKEY! Tried to call the number on the receipt (702) 978-4444. That number is useless. It's a repeat of a recording. You don't get to speak with anybody. So I had to drive back up there and tell them what happened. They made me another sandwich immediately. It was quite frustrating for that wasted SO MUCH time of my short lunch. So please CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE LEAVING HERE!",

What I love about Zupa's is that you can tell everything's homemade, and you don't get that overwhelming salt taste from premade soup. Yes the sandwiches are a bit small, but when you get a soup or salad with them they fill you up really good. I LOVED the vegetable chowder and grilled cheese I ordered. I think this just might be my new favorite place to eat.",

The salad fresh and the raspberry flavor really popped. The portions are a nice size and the meal also came with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  The staff is super friendly and super fast! I had the salted caramel creme brule for dessert. It was decadent! Cafe Zupas has various syrups that you can add to your fountain drink, including a sugar free raspberry syrup.

Both times I ordered soup and salad to go. The first time, they forgot the salad dressing for the kale and quinoa salad. I was at work and had nothing to put on in it, so into the garbage it went (I mean, come on, have you ever tried to eat kale and quinoa salad with no dressing? Horrible!) Then the next time I went there, I mentioned what happened the last time to them and told them to make sure they include the dressing with the salad. I get home and lo and behold, the dressing was there, but not nearly enough. Half the salad was completely dry. I don't know who they have making the salads, but whoever it is needs some serious training. Their saving grace is the fact that the other location that I go to has always gotten my orders right. Just won't be coming back to this location anytime soon.",

The cashier informs me that my food is being remade because it was made with cheese. Strike one. Then after about five minutes my salad comes out. Then the moment my friend takes a bite of his sandwich, the big hair is inside his food, I inform the manager, she says oh okay I'll remake it for you. She remakes it or whatever, hands it to us and says let me know if this is okay. Then I look at my salad and in the corner of my salad that was already remade had a little blonde hair in it. Strike three. Manager never stopped by a second time to see if everything was okay. And that's strike four. Will not be returning. Sweet tomatoes is around the corner. Little more pricey but at least I know if I find a hair in a salad it's gonna be mine. Oh well.",

    "text": "Really disappointed with the management and communication of this store. I had an interview at 4. I sat and waited for an hour until I walked up to the girls and asked why no one had met with me yet. They said they don't do interviews on Fridays because they have meetings and someone shouldn't have scheduled me then. I don't mind if there's a miscommunication and if they could have told me by 4:15 (once they realized it was going to be awhile and that it wasn't typical to have interviews his day!) but I waited and had to ask three people while I waited for an hour what was going on. They would say it's just going to be a minute or they're almost done. None of this was ever True. They should have told me so I could reschedule early and not waste my afternoon sitting alone. But after an hour, I politely excused myself and will not be following up with an interview after this. No longer interested in this company and will not ever go out to eat here.",

I had a turkey/artichoke grilled Panini and a bowl of wild mushroom bisque soup and both were very tasty!!  The bread you get for dipping in the soup was fresh and great and the chocolate covered strawberry was awesome and a nice touch!  I didn't try any of their salads so cannot comment there.   The girls at the counter were on a sugar rush I think--\"happy, happier and happiest!!\"  (ha ha) but very sweet and eager to please!  Prices could be a little better but they are competing with Panera, so enough said.  I will definitely consider returning so that my hubby can try it out.",

You have to choose a 2 out of the 3 choices (those choices being soup, salad, or sandwich). Their deserts are also scrumptious.  My personal favorite is the million dollar bar (giant chocolate chips, coconut flakes, graham crackers, chopped nuts, and all the love that a grandmother can give).  If you're feeling extra fancy you can order chocolate fondue (it's made from Lindt chocolate).  It's so delicious you'll want to lick the bowl clean (I've almost done this on every occasion, unfortunately I have a wife who says society frowns upon it). Catering is a service they provide as well.  I've never had it so you'll have to ask someone else.  In conclusion,it's  derlicious (yes that \"r\" is meant to be there).  I can always find something to fill my hunger at the local Cafe Zupas.",

    "text": "One star is giving this place too much credit. Staff and management were totally incompetent. Food was mediocre at best. I have gotten better salad and sandwiches from 7-11.   The staff, was ridiculous, and no manager was onsite. They did not even have a business card for him. I ended up having to take my \"FOR HERE\" order \"TO-GO\" because they had a worker seating guests after they paid...and he refused to seat us!!  In our case we were a party of 2... However I ordered enough food for probably 4-5 people. (2 soups, sandwich, salad, for myself. My wife had soup salad and sandwich. We wanted to try several menu items each and see what was our favorite. We love good soup and were really excited to try this place out. So once we paid... the idiot in charge of seating directed us to a small table right next to the ordering line. I understand the intent of the assigning seating... the place was pretty busy since it was a Saturday afternoon. However I wanted to relax and enjoy my feast without sitting \"ass-level\" next to a line of people. Additionally since our order took up 3 entire trays it physically would not fit on the table. The plates and bowls are each pretty large...   I asked him if we could wait for another table and I was told that they were reserved for groups of 3 or more... So even though my order would not physically fit on the tiny table, I could not sit somewhere else. Even though I personally counted 7 open tables, they would rather we leave (pissed off) than seat us in an appropriate sized table. I wish that I had just gotten my money back. Instead I had to get my order repackaged \"TOGO\" and went and sat in the car and ate. The entire experience was really embarrassing. This literally ruined our entire day. I was really frustrated, my wife was pissed and we ended up arguing for the next few hours (Actually we are still arguing still to this minute). All we wanted was to have an enjoyable lunch and then get some shopping done at the mall. But instead we ended up just going home.  There was even a guy there from their corporate office (But no store manager). I hate conflict and avoid it at all cost.... I eventually  told him the situation and he offered no solution except that he was \"Sorry\". He did offer to give me a business card so that I could call him \"To talk about my experience\" Dude! I don't want to call you and talk about it! I want you to fix this, here and now so I can eat the 30 dollars of food I just paid for!!! The staff was polite and I got apologies from about 4 different people while I was waiting for the order to be boxed up. How can this many people recognize a situation that warrants apologies, but not do anything to fix it... I told the corporate guy that I am totally baffled that a company would force patrons to leave with their order to go over something that ridiculous... I was told it was a \"policy\"... If I didn't know better I would thing it was simple discrimination....TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  Great job Cafe Zupas YOU SUCK! The next time I will be back will be back will be for the \"Going out of Business Sale\"   BOTTOM LINE: Do yourself a favor and go anywhere but here! try out Rachel's kitchen or Jason's Deli... Even Olive Garden... SAVE YOURSELF!!",

My second to last visit I was concerned about the freshness of the product but thought there was a possibility it had been busy. Tonight was my last visit. When I first ordered I noticed the wilted salad. When I noticed I only got 2 slivers of egg, they said, \"we can't give you anymore!\" The test of my order turned into a whole lot more of the same greed shown by...\" We're only allowed to give that....we can't do it that way...!\" There was so much of this that I can't write it all down. I will preface this by saying I never complain. I just take what is dealt. This whole situation was a perfect picture of corporate greed. Needless to say, I left with all the food still on the counter.  Guess they did a great job of suckering people in just long enough to think that lowering  their standards and significantly altering their vision of customer service was a good idea. Good luck on that one! I will NEVER go back!",

This is located by Sunset Station Casino and Galleria Mall in the corner of a little lot by Chipotle. Walking in, it is very spacious, with a separator in the middle where there is a charging station on one side (new study area? Why not!) and a soda/utensil bar with various syrups to put into your soda for added flavor.  The customer service was impeccable! Nice smiles, quick service, and an overall amazing vibe. With some recommendations from the server, I ended up choosing a Chipotle Chicken salad, a crab avocado melt, and sweet tea. For everything, it was barely $11. You can tell that the ingredients were fresh (aside from the fact that they prepare your food in front of you). In my opinion, MILES better than Panera Bread. The food was not bland and the proportions were just right. And for the price, I ended up leaving the place full and satisfied. Not mention the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry that comes with every order! Score!  Overall, I totally recommend this place. Food is amazing, people are kind, and you get what you pay for. I'll be coming here way more often!",

They also have desserts but each meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry.   When I came to this location, I just went with my usual Chicken Enchilada Chili soup and the Nuts About Berry salad. They have A LOT going on which isn't bad but is a little overwhelming. I feel like it's kind of a Panera Bread on steroids lol.   Anyways, my soup has add-ins of sour cream, cheese, and tortilla strips which are all 69 cents each. The soup itself is really good! I like how filling it is and how it really tastes like a chicken enchilada.The Nuts About Berry salad is a little on the sweeter side but pairs nicely with the soup since its that salty/sweet combo. Overall the food is good, but it's just a little hectic in there. Maybe it depends on the location though.",

We had the following:  Yucatan Chicken Tortilla Soup and Honey Cilantro Carnitas Combo $8.99  Garden Chowder and California Turkey Combo $8.99  Creme Brulee $3.49  The best tasting dish was the garden chowder. It was rich but not too rich and the salt level was just right. The Chicken tortilla soup on the other hand was very salty. I'm guessing it was bc a lot of people ordered it and the employee just happened to scoop all the bottom bits of the soup container when he served my portion. The sandwiches were good too. I give this place 4 stars bc of how clean the area was and that they offered 1/2 priced desserts toward the end of the day.",

I would have given it 5 stars but since it was not a \"regular sit in\" restaurant/diner as I had thought, like Applebee's or MiMi's Cafe, because we walked in through the back and did not see the \"cafeteria\" or fast food style of ordering.   The food was hearty and had tons of flavor. I ordered the New England clam chowder and was pleasantly surprised with the layers of flavors. I also ordered the crab sandwich, with what looked like actual pieces of crab, or just really good imitation.  I was also surprised that the meal also came with a piece of bread and a cute chocolate covered strawberry (which may have been complementary,  but not sure if it's a regular part of the meal, as we came in before it was closing so they may have been getting rid of items, but hey, it was welcomed) would even just like servings of the crab alone, it had great flavor. Very friendly, helpful,  and patient staff.  Overall great experience and will come back again to try the menu.",

I get to the front of the line faster than I can make a decision!    The menu is huge!!  The have a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I usually go for their combo meal where you can mix & match two of the three selections.  The combo also comes with the cutest chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread.  They also let you try samples of their soups, which is always nice.  This place is great if you're looking for something healthier and are crunched for time.

    "text": "Hey, every other lunch spot in the neighborhood. You'd better watch out! Cafe Zupas has arrived.  I was a huge fan of the first Vegas location on Eastern Ave. Now that they've opened much closer to home, I'm ready to forsake that original spot altogether. Cafe Zupas delivers soups, salads, and sandwiches with fresh ingredients and in-house dressings with great service. They always have someone at the door, they always clear tables without taking tips, and they follow a carefully crafted script of questions that gets customers through the line efficiently while also upselling on things like desserts and drinks. The foods are not what you would call authentic, but they are delicious Americanized renditions.  I always get the try 2 combo ($8.29), where you get to choose 2 of 3 items from whole sandwiches, half soups, and half salads. Regardless of the weather (read: summer heat), I almost always get a half soup with a sandwich. The soups that I've tried are all really good. The lobster bisque and the roasted red pepper and lobster may not have real lobster, but they're both delicious. This week, I've really grown to love the wild mushroom bisque and the tomato basil. This location seems to serve their bread almost cold, so dip it fully in the soup to warm it up.  As for sandwiches, I definitely steer toward the ciabatta bread sandwiches rather than the panini sandwiches. The honey cilantro carnitas sandwich, which is a relatively new item, is very impressive because of its glaze, the pork, and the avocado. BBQ pulled pork sandwich and Italian club sandwich are also long-time favorites, and turkey cranberry is a nice reminder of my favorite holiday. Cuban grilled pork is alright if you're into that sort of thing.  Finally, even though they're not my preferred choice, the salads are pretty good options as well. Mangoberry salad, Thai mango chicken, and superfood delight are all salads that I've sampled here from friends or family.  Oops, almost forgot about dessert! Aside from the standard chocolate-covered strawberries, which are always great, they have many options for people with a sweet tooth. The creme brulee options are all nice, but my new favorite is a slice of chocolate heaven called the Sinful 7. It's rich, it's sweet, and it's chocolatey. I definitely need to share that with somebody next time because it's such a huge portion after a meal.  One thing I do miss from the Eastern Avenue location is that one or two of the regular employees definitely recognized me on my return visits, even as early as the second or the third time. Doesn't seem to be the case just yet on Sunset, but I'm so happy with the food and the location that we'll have plenty of time to warm up to each other. Make this a stop if you're on this side of town.",

I recieved a coupon in in the mail for 50% off that expired in 3 days so I figured I would check it out on my way to work it looked so busy I thought I wouldn't have time to order and finish my meal.   Upon entering a employee was holding the door open for me with excitement and welcomed me inside and as soon as I stepped in line I was approached by another employee and I told her I had never been to a Cafe Zupas before so she gave me a menu and some recommendations of their popular menu items and informed me that the try 2 comes with a full sandwich because she said they were small. They definitely were not. I was surprised because at Panera u only get a half sandwich and a bowl of soup on a You pick 2.   The line is setup with employees at each of the salad , soup and sandwich stations so u go through the line pretty fast. I couldn't decide what soup I wanted and they were more than happy to offer me samples. They have a big selection to choose from as far as salads soups and sandwiches so you are bound to find something you like & every menu item comes with a chocolate covered strawberry that even my chocolate hating self enjoyed.   I got my Try 2 for $4.80 since I had a 50% off mailer coupon. I would have been just as happy if I had paid full price because it was totally worth it. I got a full sandwich and a huge bowl of soup. I got the Turkey Bacon and Avacado sandwich which was grilled to perfection and I got the tomato and basil soup which was creamy and delicous. At panera u get a half sandwich and a small bowl of soup. So they are definitely giving Panera some competition. Granted Panera offers bakery items and such. I can't wait to bring my Mom here soon honestly everything looks tasty and the customer service was outstanding.",

Also she felt that they are super stingy with their toppings and don't want to give you extra unless their charging you for it :/   The chicken gumbo soup was good but it gave my mom such bad heartburn later on that night, when I went to drop off the soup to my grandma she said it was ridiculously SALTY!! I even tasted it to make sure she wasn't trippin but even I thought it was bad! She said it was so bad she went back the next day and it took it back for a different soup and that soup gave her diarrhea!

We arrived just after 11:00 am and there was no line. Wow, what a selection of  sandwiches and salads (they also had soups but it was too hot for me to eat soup).  I chose the pick two which was a whole sandwich and 1/2 salad for around $8. I had the  California turkey sandwich on ciabatta and the mango berry salad. I noticed some wonderful desserts going down the line and had to try the \"million dollar bar\".  The salad was fantastic. Lots of fresh strawberries, blueberries and mango on mixed greens with walnuts  and a mango dressing. Mmmmmm, delicious and perfect in the hot weather. The sandwich was also for very good. The bread was super fresh and soft.   Now for that dessert. OMG. It was an oatmeal brownie loaded with coconut and chocolate chips. So moist and flavorful I could have had two. I should mention that everything is house made and you can definitely tell. All of the staff were very friendly and quickly cleared out table when we were finished.   They also have a free selection of Italian soda syrups at the drink bar. It was fun to try a couple different combinations as well as fresh lemon and lime wedges on ice.   I have found a new lunch spot and will be back soon. So many different items to try, I can't wait.",

    "text": "Summary: Appears to be a healthy alternative but....not really. Employees are apparently completely disempowered from providing good customer service.   The whole experience feels miserly and like you're being nickled and dimed---tightwad and penny pinching---no sense of abundance, good spiritedness, or generosity. The company seems to provide the very least for the very most money.  Not a good feeling. I won't be back.  Portions *absurdly* small.  The healthy salads are laughably little, with just a few of the ingredients listed scattered around.  Sandwiches came with the most scant, minimal amount of meat and other ingredients possible. The \"New England Crab Salad\" is fake crab that tastes like plastic. The turkey is essentially turkey LOAF. There is no roast beef. Weird overabundance of pork on the menu.    I asked for whipped cream on my cake and the manager told me they are only \"authorized\" to put whipped cream on cheesecake---and because there is no pricing for 1 DOLLOP of whipped cream, he would not put whipped cream on my cake.  The soups are very tasty -- but portions are ludicrous for the price.  They hold up the size of the container and then LITERALLY fill it 2/3 of the way. I asked them to fill it up, and the manager told the employee \"You can reportion that\" (like a robot talking), and the employee did the same exact thing again.  I said \"I don't understand why you're putting so little in there---there's almost an INCH between the top of the container!\"  He said \"We are authorized to give you only 2 ladles of soup for the Large.\"  I felt like the character in the movie \"Oliver\" ---over and over again---  \"Please, sir....may I have some more?\" and the response an astonished \"MOOOORRRE?!?!?!?\" ha ha  So disappointing. Thought I'd found a healthy delicious alternative, but it's just customer exploitation....a mean-fisted cheap operation that doesn't let its employees go off script (not fair to them and not fair to customers)",

Only complaint is when cooperate changed the bread a while back, not as good as it used to be (but I don't need the extra calories anyway so it worked in my favor haha) definitely one of my favorite quick but not too quick lunch options.",

The soups are consistently good but I wouldn't describe the sandwiches or salads any better than average. There is the plus of a chocolate covered cherry that comes with every meal and if you like extra flavor in your beverages there are flavored syrups next to the sodas.  I really wanted this place to be better, but during the day there is such a high ratio of young children to employees who can clean up after them - that it's best to wait until later to go. If you are the family looking to blend in with some excited children, then you have found the jackpot.",

For the first year that they were open it was great, but every experience since then continues to be worse than the last. The food has declined (from the soup being cold to a salad with hardly anything in the bowl), the service isn't as good (from an employee that didn't even acknowledge us standing right in front of them to an employee being completely lost in what they were supposed to do- possibly new to the job, but no one around to assist him). The prices are great, you do get a healthy bang for your buck (fast food prices with healthy food plates)...but it needs to maintain the service and food that they started with for us to return.",

You have to order sandwiches/salads first, then walk down the line and explain what you want again and then finally repeat your entire order again to the cashier.  If you're ordering for more than 1 person it's really difficult.  How about taking our full order at the beginning of the line and letting the cashier know so we don't have to repeat everything a hundred times?",

Surprisingly, the fancy grilled cheese! (They have some fancy name for it, and it is seriously delish!) you can't go wrong with any of their salads either. And the best part- a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry with every meal! Seriously, how do you beat that? Oh, and it's like the only place that I will pay for a fountain drink because of all the yummy syrup add-in flavors to create your own delicious drinks!!!",

Unlike Subway, however, Cafe Zupas gives you the option to TRY THINGS OUT before you eat them. I didn't even know how much I needed that until someone gave me the option. This time I had the 9$ combo with a chicken pesto sandwich and a half bowl (half is way more than enough) of Tortilla soup. It was fabulous! But based on the little taste I got of both the clam chowder and the lobster bisque, there are a ton of viable options, and I am indecently excited to try them all.",

Who seriously A:) is even thinking about lunch that early and B:) if they are, thinks \"I better order now!\" FAIL Cafe Zupas. Maybe some better planning/staffing on your part should be rethought.

The salad we shared was the Strawberry one with all the greens. I wanted so much more. Then for soups I tried the Garden Chowder...HEAVEN, ABSOLUTE HEAVEN.  Then I tried my friends Clam Chowder, with Lobster Bisque added Wow Heaven on earth. They gave us bread and a special treat too. For Dessert...Yes, we had Dessert... Half off after a certain time because it's either they give it to you or the trash. Creme Brullee Carmel for me and Chocolate Creme Brullee for my friend. Of course we shared that too and they were nice and creamy and not to rich. You couldn't ask for anything more. Charging station, Drink Flavor station, great Food and Great Friendly People.
