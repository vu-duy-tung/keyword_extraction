If your a vegan who prefers lighter fare, be wary what you order on the menu, I found the superfood burger with fries to be on the heavier side.   The fries were a little too greasy for my taste.  Overall go here if your looking for heavier vegan fare and are not worried about calories.",

The decor is so lively and vibrant, service is speedy, staff are friendly, prices are affordable & food is excellent.  I sneak out of work and go to VegeNation on my lunch break quite frequently, and they always get my food out to me in what seems to be only about 5 minutes, making it an awesome lunch spot.  My favorite menu items have got to be the appetizers, specifically the Bao Wow, Save the Tuna, & Mexican Hummus (which is a generous portion!)  My favorite entrees are The VegeNation Burger (seriously one of the best vegan burgers), & Muchas Gracias.  For a more light, healthy meal the Pamela Anderson raw tacos are flavorful and refreshing.  If you happen to go for breakfast, hands down you've got to try their Food Not Bombs breakfast bowl, it is one of my favorite breakfast items ever!  And last for dessert I recommend the cheese plate, which is locally made by Virgin Cheese, check out their Facebook page for more info on the cheese!",

The one time something was too spicy for me they were more than happy to switch it for another menu item. The best service is found here and that's just as important as anything else. The waitresses check up on you, refill your drinks and make great suggestions when you're just not sure what to get. Appreciate what this place has to offer and will always come back here thanks to their food and service.",

We started out with some fair trade organic coffee. It was served in a manual coffee press that contained about four cups. I also liked that they had almond milk and raw stevia for my coffee.  Appetizers:Bao Bun and Save the Tuna Roll.  **The Bao Bun contained some tofu, spinach, mushrooms, and an amazing sauce. Excellent!!!  **Save the Tuna is a roll that is made with veggies and purple rice. Excellent!!!  Entrees:  Veggie Nation Burger - Excellent! Muchas Gracias / Quesada - Excellent! Ellen DeGeneres - three veggie tacos. The shells consisted of collar green leaves. Excellent!  The total bill was $72.00 for 4 entrees, 3 apps, and coffee.

The atmosphere is wonderful and the food was some of the best vegan food I have ever had.  There was no way I could eat all of the great menu options that I want to try in my stomach! On this trip, I had the eggplant stack and the \"bao wow\" appetizer -- both phenomenal! I'm a sucker for great tofu dishes and the bao wow was cooked to perfection.   My server was very helpful with recommendations and was great with service as well. He   I hear the tamales are great, as is the sangria. That will be my next meal. I also saw someone order the chimi and it looked delectable.   Also, if you get a chance to check out the cute back patio, do.   I will be back any chance I can! Maybe I'll make a trip to Vegas just for Vegenation ...",

We ordered the Buffalo cauliflower, chicken pot pie gnocchi, a pizza, and tiramisu The buffalo cauliflower was a decent portion, wasn't very crispy, but despite it being a little spicy it was very sour... The flavours we're definitely not balanced The chicken pot pie gnocchi I don't have much complaints about. It looked like what I've seen from other pictures on Yelp. The pizza was a huge disappointment. It looked so good from a recent IG post from chef Chloe. But our pizza looked nothing like that. Our crust was blonde, soggy, and the menu says \"fresh pineapple\". But clearly they were freshly out of the can!  Last thing we got was tiramisu. There is a very thick amount of cashew marscapone layered with a coffee sponge cake. The cake itself tasted good, but the marscapone was so gritty and there was just way too much of it.  Anyways, the service was friendly, but I would never come back here.",

The noodles are good and the veggies go great with it. The buffalo cauliflower and dumpling are perfect to share as appetizers.  I have also had the drinks and the Moscow mule with carrot juice is so refreshing.   I love the idea behind it and what it brings to the community.

The fries I felt were not good at all! They were overlooked and flavorless as well. The chocolate tacos I was extremely disappointed in  They WAY were smaller than in the pictures and I didn't think they tasted very good either. I'm word other items on the menu are probably more enjoyable than the two I did not like. And because the hostess was so polite and helpful, I'll surely return to give it another try; especially for the Buffalo Cauliflower!",

(Still doesn't take away from how kick ass they are, order them!)(order one of everything, like we did.) Strawberry milkshake 10/10  Chocolate milkshake 10/10 can't decide which flavor I like most. Choc & strawberrry are amaze.  Curly fries & French fries 10/10 delicious  Zucchini fries or whatever- also a 10/10. So much flavor, the ranch goes better with this than the chicken in my opinion.

I also became extremely fond of the pizzas, Mushroom Madness being my favorite.  I also tried the Pho one time and I loved it.

The only good thing we had was the cauliflower wings appetizer. My husband ordered the east to west jackfruit tacos and I had the chicken pot pie.   My chicken pot pie was alright except that half of the gnocchi tasted like flour because they were undercooked. My husband tried to like the tacos but they weren't good enough to eat. I tried them and it tasted like tomato paste.   Here's the thing...I don't expect to like everything I try but at a restaurant I expect the server to care somewhat. I don't remember her name but she had a \"vegan\" tatoo on her neck. We told her we couldn't eat the tacos and she did not try to fix the issue. I've been a server and you are supposed to see what you can do (offer something else, etc.) She literally asked nothing and brought the bill.   So we essentially paid $35 and left hungry.",

Their curry ketchup was watery and too sweet. A positive is that the service is good. Ian helped us and was pretty attentive. I did feel weird when I told him about the fries because he said, \" I really hate that.\" If others have given them the same feedback, the chef or owners should do something about it. Not sure if this place is worth the try.",

They usually have a DJ or musician playing live to serenade you through your meal, along with the occasional pop up vendors. The staff are beyond friendly; Jessica will keep you smiling from ear to ear with her infectious and vivacious attitude. The food = to die for. They have something for absolutely everyone. Burgers, salads, bowls, the chicken and waffles pop-up every Sunday is my personal favorite, and it's all vegan! You won't regret checking it out.",

I tend to stay far far away from downtown and the strip as much as possible - but it was worth a little drive and a parking meter. LOL  Food was great!  -Save the tuna: amazing flair on the California roll  -Hoki Poki: not my cup of tea, at all -Downtown Toy: delish! Could have used more spicy aioli sauce though -Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi - definitely FULL of flavor, &don't be fooled .. it IS vegan -Eggplant stacks: Good not great -Brownie Sundae- YES YES YES. SOO good!!!  Awesome server, thank you David for being patient with us, as it was our first time! We appreciate the recommendations!! Also, one thing I always notice is the waters (I know, I'm weird.) They always kept them full - thank you!  CONS:  Nothing MAJOR, however their complimentary \"Monday night drink\" was terrible. Didn't even drink it even though it was free - sorry. And the ketchup - I'm a huge ketchup girl especially on my fries &although it's nice that they make it in-house, I'd rather they didn't.  I would definitely return back to Vegenation if I was in the area but probably won't drive across town on a regular basis. Thanks for a great dining experience though!!",

Once I finally made it out to VegeNation, I was NOT disappointed!  This place is delicious!  And there are so many options!  I find myself making up every excuse in the book to go downtown, so that I can stop by here because it's \"on the way.\"  This is more expensive than what I can typically afford, but they are extremely affordable for the quality of food they offer.  I keep saving money wherever I can to afford coming here.  My only gripe is that they weren't around sooner :)  They're located less than a block away from where I went to high school, if they'dve been around 6 years ago I know where I would've been eating lunch (and after-school snacks) every day!  Try the Downtown Tony Sliders!!!  They're my favourite!",

My friend and I had to wait a little while (about 5 minutes) to be seated since we went there around 1pm and the restaurant seemed pretty packed. The staff was so friendly and apologized very nicely for the wait. We ordered 3 appetizers instead of the entree dishes which were the tamale, buffalo cauliflowers, and the sushi. The tamale was pretty filling because of the corn meal but it was the best I've ever tasted! Highly recommend if you ever go there. The buffalo sauce on the cauliflowers had just the right amount of spice, and the cauliflowers were so tender and fresh and juicy. They also give you a vegan ranch if you can't handle the spice but I personally prefered to eat it plain. The sushi was good too but wasn't as impressive as the other dishes, the purple rice that they use was really unique though! Overall, this place has a cozy atmosphere and I would definitely recommend it for a brunch date, or even a family night!",

For the main course, I had the pho and it was very good, but a little too spicy for my taste. All the veggies were fresh and it was very appealing. BF ordered the sweet potato ravioli and he loved it. It had a great flavor and a creamy, satisfying sauce.   The staff was very polite and attentive in their interactions with us. It was pretty annoying that they were jumping, skipping, singing and dancing around near the side tables, where we were sitting. It was a distraction that made the place feel like we were in a school cafeteria.",

    "text": "Awesome meatless options that are available for delivery to the strip. I can't talk about the ambiance since I haven't been inside but the food is great. I was very into the buffalo cauliflower wings ($7.95) as they were spicy, tangy, and crispy all in one. They come with a great dairy free dipping sauce for cooling. Additionally, I liked the save the tuna roll ($7.95) as it offers some sushi flavors without the fish and the sweet potato and black bean quesadillas ($12.95). The plates offer a lot of food and are sure to fill you up but be sure to sample multiple items as the menu offers a lot of great variety. Overall, this was a great meatless option for those looking to escape the booze, smoke, and steak of the strip. I would recommend this place to those looking to cleanse their bodies while in Vegas.",

I'm so use to being limited on my vegan options when dining out and with my 1st visit to Vegenation, I was like a kid in a candy store with endless choices to choose from. I've dine here twice and keep ordering takeout. Here is what I've discovered.....  Buffalo Cauliflower: 5 ***** FANTASTIC! Gluten free, No breading, baked with amazing hot sauce! A must everytime I order in or to go  Mushroom Spinach Dumplings: 3 *** Just okay. These had some good flavor (ordered steam) but extremely sticky and needed the soy sauce to add something to it.  Chicken tacos: 5 ***** Delicious! Pop up meal gluten free Gardein chicken with lime slaw and Mexican rice.   Coconut Thai Curry 5 ***** BOMB!! Gluten free and wow at 1st bite. Made with sweet pot noodles   Eggplant: 4 **** Flavorful. Gluten free, great flavor but there were some crunchy bites and I believe it was from the cashew cheese. It was a little strange chewing on crunchy in eggplant but had great flavor.  Kids Grill Cheese Sandwhich: 4 **** The 4 year old boy with us ate every bite of his sandwich but wasn't too thrilled about the large potato fries. They're wedges and didn't seem cooked all the way through but that might be their style in the fries.   Brownie Sundae: 5***** A Must!!! This was incredible! Their ice cream is made out of avocado and nut butter. It's vanilla & chocolate on a brownie with caramelized bananas and Coconut shavings. They have a child's ice cream with choc mouse and gummy worms but they were out of worms so the boy with us had a scoop of choc ice cream. My pic shows you what he thought about it.....  Please check them out!! They offer breakfast with mimoas and bloody Mary's. Their alcohol choices are from a local Las Vegas brewery and organic. During the holidays they accepted donated pet beds and blankets for the animal shelters and in return you received a free glass of sangria. Wi-Fi is also available",

Finally I had to get up and get someone to come to me and waited for ever for our order. And there was like 2 other tables there so it wasn't like it was busy. It was empty and horrible vibes.. the guests should feel welcome and comfortable when dining-in. So much for a \"friendly\" Vegan restaurant.",

We came in for take out. we then asked the host questions on the menu. The host had no idea what was on the menu and couldn't answer any of our questions about desert. She claimed she was new. As we were talking to her, the phone rang and she picked up. She then began to ignore us and decided to help the customer on the phone first. Once she hung up their was no apology or anything for ignoring us. Once our order was placed we then stepped outside. As we came back in the host didn't even recognize us and asked if we were dining in or taking food out. Clearly this host was doing everything she could imaginable to provide terrible service. We then told her we placed an order with her 5 minutes ago. She then rolled her eyes. As we waited for our desert customers after us were getting there food prior to us. After the fourth customer prior to us got their food I asked for a manger. The host then rushed to the back to get us our food. The manger gave me the owners information for a complaint against the host. Host was Hispanic decent with black hair. Owners name is Donald. I gave him a call for the complaint. It's been a month and he hasn't called back. The owner clearly feels this is acceptable customer service. We used to love this place. But being treated the way we did. We will no longer support this business in the future.",

    "text": "This review is almost entirely based on the service provided to us when we ate at VegeNation.   I came in to eat with a party of four. One of the people I was with has a service dog. We put our name on the waiting list. Eventually, we are next to be seated and there was a four-top table in the front of the restaurant. It was a really beautiful day, so we were excited to get the table by the window. However, the hostess came to inform us that we have to be seated in the back area. Upon asking why, she replied that it VegeNation's policy to seat service animals outside. We specifically asked to be at the open table by the window. With attitude, she told us, no. Bewildered but starving at this point, we just agreed to go outside. Like I said, it was a nice day... It was actually my birthday. So, I didn't exactly want to get into things.   Our server was so forgetful. She got our orders wrong for different things. We needed to remind her two or three times about the same forgotten item. It was extremely disappointing. There were also periods of time where it seemed like she disappeared - almost like she forgot to come check on us. There was also a table next to us that was full of dishes. It was left for the entire time we dined.   There was also an employee on break or something outside on the table by us. He was sleeping or listening to music with his eyes closed. Ordinarily, I wouldn't care but it just seemed like it was the employee break room as opposed to a dining area. Later in the meal, two employees came outside to another one of the tables to do silverware, so it added to the break room feel.   During our meal, a couple was seated outside. After a few minutes, they requested to be seated inside, and their request was honored.   Later, we inquired again why we were forced to sit outside. Another employee said that there was a person with a dog allergy inside, so they had to seat us in the back. At this point, I'm livid. Was it a restaurant policy or because it was somehow known that someone had a dog allergy? Someone lied to us. And, on top of all that, the restaurant is NOT allowed to do this. Regardless of either reasons, it is not allowed. According to Nevada State Law, they are not allowed to force us to eat in a specific section (i.e., outside) because we had a service animal in our party. The management will be receiving a more detailed letter regarding this matter. I really hope they take this into consideration when making policies or training their employees.   Food was okay. Nothing special. Service was horrible. It isn't very often that I leave a food establishment actually mad. This was one of them.",

As someone who enjoys real mozzarella on pizza regularly, Daiya's attempt is a bad product. Its taste and odor are gross, and the texture is reminiscent of overripe peaches. There are far superior substitutes available out there.  Also tried one of their burgers. The burger substitute patty was like a super burnt, thin burger. Like the cheese substitute for the pizza, it's easy to find better burger substitutes in the freezer aisle. The house made ketchup was mediocre. Just get store bought stuff.  I do hope the staff here do improve on these things. There are just currently much better vegan options I have tried that have put this stuff to shame.",

We were seated, then sat for 6 min with no attention at all. Then two other gentlemen entered, and were promptly taken to the open table. That was the final straw for me. My wife and I decided that we'd eat somewhere else. I'm so disappointed because the food here is amazing, but not more important than my value as a customer.",

Given that I came in shortly after they opened, the woman in the shop was very helpful. The place has flowers all around and tiny pumpkins on tables. One weird thing that I've never seen in my life was there wasn't any big counters with a register. When you walk in al you see are the seats and all the way in the back are the 2 bathrooms along with the kitchen. Not sure how to explain in but it was different.   Food 5/5: I ordered the Food not Bowls I believe off the Breakfast menu and it was so delicious! I took it to go because I was in a hurry, it didn't take too long to be brought out. The food was so good. Usually there's not enough salt, not enough spice however my meal was very good. They also added a side of a hot sauce which was very good. I enjoy spicy food so I was happy.   I would love to come back again to try their other items. ( especially their cauliflower) I wish they served everything on their menu at all times. ):",

The reviews were good, so we went for it! Street parked our fancy rental car and paid $2 (got reimbursed from the restaurant, which was nice and very unexpected). We got the coffee, which came in a French press. We waited the 3 minutes, but the coffee was verrrryyyy weak and watery. It tasted like tea... or what I can imagine dirty brown water trash would taste like. It's ok, I feel like a lot of people don't prefer dark roast and we should have asked before ordering. We split the biscuits and gravy and the breakfast burrito. Both were good! The collard greens were shameful but we are from the South so you know... what do you expect? The place is very cozy and I would recommend it for early morning, since it's very chill.",

There are options of vegan offerings that mimic meat or dairy items and there are fresh green items, that are top grade fresh. The restaurant atmosphere is casual.  The restaurant is located close to the Fremont Street Experience the downtown has to offer. It was probably the best restaurant, at least from a vegan perspective, that the area had to offer.",

It was good enough, but it wasn't anything special. My husband had the waffle. The waffle was basic and didn't have much of a taste on it's own, so it relied on the toppings. We also ordered the cauliflower wings. The sauce on them was really good. I've never had cauliflower wings before, so I can't say whether they are better or worse than anywhere else.   Service: our server was nice, and the food came out in a timely fashion.  She did have a lot of tables, so it took time to see her and get the check   I would go back to try lunch.",

I came here on a Friday night with some old coworkers for dinner and was somewhat weary since this was my first vegan experience for my clearly not vegan body. I was very happily surprised though. This place is delicious!   For starters we shared the vegan sushi which actually tasted very similar to regular sushi. It also was quite filling for just about 8 pieces. As an entree I went with the Muchas Gracis. It was a quesadilla filled with sweet potatoes and black beans. Strangely enough it had a cheesy taste too which was very good and the portion size was quite big and filling.  I'm glad I branched out and gave this place a try. I'll definitely be back again to try some of their other dishes. Gotta love the free sangria for checking in on Yelp as and well!",

Visited during the brunch hour specifically to try the chicken and waffles and was absolutely blown away! Also tried the burger and it was so tasty, homemade-like. Since the chicken and waffles already came with fries I asked if I could get another side with the burger and the waitress was so accommodating. I was so surprised that my side salad was SO huge, with all kinds of dark leafy greens like kale, and colors of the rainbow. Thank you!!!  For drinks tried the kombuchas of the day which were very refreshing.   The environment is very clean, cute decor, friendly staff, gorgeous flowers. You will leave this place absolutely satisfied- content stomach and great experience. Thanks for the positive vibes, hope to be back soon when in Vegas!!!",

The place itself is TINY!   We walked in with a total of 4 people & we could barely fit from the space given starting from the \"hostess\" desk & the door. We waited about 2-3 minutes to even get noticed by staff yet there was plenty of staff walking around us and not even making eye contact. Thankfully our seat was good, we got a window seat towards the back with a beautiful green floral back drop. Great for pics!  Our server was decent, she seemed to be in such a hurry which was so uncomfortable because she made us feel rushed yet when we needed her after we put in our order, she was nowhere to be found so we had to wait until our food arrived to let them know we needed our server since we wanted our free \"check in\" Sangria, which was horrible. They must of used the cheapest alcohol because it was gross and tasted like nothing but alcohol.   Our food looked great but lacked flavor. I ordered the East West Tacos. Do not order them! They are extremely sweet, so sweet that I could not even finish one taco. I only ate the tops which were fresh coleslaw and guacamole. The jackfruit was drenched in bbq sauce and it was not a good mix. The tortilla did not taste good and seemed cold, like they didn't heat up the tortilla all the way. My sister ordered their Picante Pineapple Pizza, she said she liked it but the from what I tasted, the flavors were okay but didn't come together well. My mom ordered the Vegenation Burger and said it was good, my daughter ordered the kids Spaghetti & Meatballs and the pasta and sauce was good but the meat balls weren't that good.   What was good was their Coconut Chia Seed Lemonade & the Hibiscus Water.  Overall, customer service, the price you pay for the food & having to pay for parking, not even worth it for me.",

I had the Vegan Sushi and a Mushroom Pizza. I loved the Mushroom Pizza with the exception of the crust. It was far too thin and made most of the toppings runny. Overall extremely tasty but it was slightly annoying to eat. Vegan Sushi was interesting, While I can't say I'm a huge fan but it was tasty but at the same time it could have a bit more flavor. I'm a huge fan of sushi and I really wanted this to be great. As for the staff they were kind and genuine.   Now on to the part I hate. I get it this is geared to a certain crowd (young 20 something liberal hipsters). Please forgive for being so blunt. To be fair though there is nothing wrong with the titles I mentioned above. The main issue I have with this place is the decor and the anti meat propaganda associated with it. Another odd thing I encountered was the lack of soda on the menu. Now I don't know if this was somehow tied into you guys being a new restaurant or not. I just feel this very odd vibe that you guys are trying force healthy choices on the patrons. Let us make are own choices.   1+ Good Vibes free refills on cold brew   Million Dollar Question: Will you be back?

I had the sweet potato walnut ravioli both times I went because it was THAT good. My companion had the jackfruit tacos one day and the burrito the next. Both were unique and excellent.

    "text": "Let me just start out by saying: WOW. This place is one for the record books!! We went there last night for the first time, after finding it via \"vegan restaurant\" search on here. So happy that we went!   The ambiance is very mellow and the restaurant design is one you would find in the outdoors, with vines hanging around and an almost rustic theme throughout. Properly named, VegeNation, is quite a turn than other vegan restaurants that I've visited in Vegas before. The service was spot on and our waitress was very attentive. We ordered water and the Jamaican hibiscus punch (really tasty- had a clove/cinnamon taste to the hibiscus and not too sweet) as we looked over the menu.  To start, we ordered the Bao Wow and the Italian Dumplings. The Bao Wow came out first, and since we'd never had Bao buns before it was quite the experience. These two little scrumptious sandwiches were gone in less than five minutes. The Bao Buns were lightly sweetened, steamed to perfection and the tofu was cooked just right..mix in some spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and a sweet kind of terriyaki sauce, and we have a winner people. Seriously. Then, while waiting for our pasta to come, we saw our waitress walk by with the Save The Tuna starter. Needless to say, we ordered that too because we are obsessed with sushi. And while we were at it, we also ordered the Pho-King-Delicious (we were HUNGRY).  The pasta came out quickly followed by the sushi and the pho. We ate the sushi first- the rice was a dark purple colour and it looked like it contained jackfruit and a few other veggies. It was plated on a creamy sauce of the gods and came with soy sauce. That was gone in less than two minutes. Very well put together and thought out- made our sushi that we make at home seem like a waste of time.  Now, on to the pasta entree, the Italian Dumplings. Just when we thought our taste buds were at their max in the \"wow factor\" we were proven wrong again. The sauce was what seemed like a mushroom gravy combination and it was mixed with chunks of aspargus. The pasta was phenomenal with just the right amount of sweet potatoes and veggies to pasta (certainly wished there were more of those homemade dumplings on the plate as we contemplated getting another dish of it).  The Pho-King-Delicious came out steaming. It was the darkest pho soup I have ever seen, as it was a very deep black colour. Make sure you have a nice cool beverage ready for this soup because it is SPICY. If you have congestion, this is definitely the cure. The \"Miracle noodles\", the tofu cubes, veggies and the broth were overall very delicious but too spicy for me to continue eating. No waste there, though, because my partner enjoyed the rest of it. WIN.  At this point, I was still hungry and perused the menu again. The Bao Wow called to me again and I couldnt help myself as I ordered another round. Even more tasty than the first..can you believe it?  Lastly, we ordered dessert even though we were feeling almost too full (gotta live a little, amirite?). So, we ended our meal with the brownie sundae. Gd damn it was so good. One scoop each of chocolate and vanilla almond milk ice cream, perfectly carmelized banana halves, slices of strawberries, nuts, caramel and chocolate sauce on top of a decadent brownie (that was soft and chewy in the center). We ate the whole thing, despite ourselves. After this, we quickly ordered the check so as not to order anything else.  This meal was what my vegan dreams are made of and much more than I could ever expect. We were even able to meet the chef and give our profound thanks and admiration at such a dreamy meal. Left the restaurant full and happy. Cannot wait to go back..do yourself a favour and go there too! (:",

    "text": "I am extremely disappointed at the service My husband and I received today. It was my 3rd time here and made it in just when the restaurant cleared out of its busy crowd this afternoon  . It was an annoying experience from the start. I'm not in the mood to get too far into detail but I will have to. our server was very forgetful and I wish I knew her name but I didn't ask as I was in a hurry to leave the place after my husband and I waited more than hour for our food that never got made!! The server had the nerve to lie to our face about some BS receipt not being printed so our food never got made which was an obvious lie. The big group of people who were seated next to us got their food first and they got there about 15 min after we did. Aside from that she never checked if we needed our drinks refreshed and she was busy interacting with other guests. I felt embarrassed for the lie she told us and when she said the food would now be getting started I said we were leaving! I was so upset because I was looking forward to going there with my husband who has been embracing a vegan lifestyle with me and for this to be his first experience I was highly upset. My husband and I left without bringing it to the managers attention because we just wanted to leave. It was ridiculous absolutely no excuse for why she forgot our order. It was not busy at that point and everyone who got there around the time we did all got there big orders just fine.  If our server had apologized and admitted to her mistake I wouldn't have left with such a bitter feeling about the over all restaurant. I will not return after today's experience. Not even for the food. Honestly the food is decent nothing mind blowing but decent and cool that there's a vegan restaurant not too far from me but I learned my lesson. Just stick to where I know I will be acknowledged, treated fairly, and not be forgotten. I hate when people mess with my food and money.  My previous experiences were really pleasant . I went at night the other 2 times. No problem with the service I even looked passed the dirty menus and dirty seating because the service was awesome. Unfortunately today's experience was enough to turn me off completely.  I'm also extra annoyed  because I have close friends who are good friends with the owner and manager there. They only told me good things about the reset project which I was planning on attending and I was always checking my email for their opening announcement... Anyway I'm disappointed...",

Vanessa served us, and she was super friendly and outgoing.  Their vegan pizza is amazing. The cheeze is super gooey and wonderful. The cheeze board was also super tasty with three different cheese flavors and kale chips as an alernative to bread. Overall, from atmosphere to the service and food, we had such a great time gorging on healthy and delicious meals here.",

The sandwiches are all yummy. The quesadilla is good too.   The ambiance is nice and relaxed, maybe a little hipster-y. The artwork is great. The staff are all chill and very nice.   The popup lunches are good. My favorite was the smoked carrot \"lox\" but I haven't seen that one return yet...hint hint chef.   I usually come here for lunch because it's near my office.  It's fast, fresh, and not too heavy...no food coma to power through in the afternoon.   If I drink anything it's usually water and maybe a glass of wine. They do have cocktails too though.",

Both the servers hostesses were really nice. Food was great. The space itself is really nice and bright, and the layout makes it feel comfortable and spacious for the size of the restaurant.   Two small things... Consistency. Got the buffalo cauliflower both times I ate here. The portion was less than half the size the second time. Noticed in the pictures on yelp things varying a whole lot.  Second... And this is going to sound really petty... It'd be nice if they offered room temperature water before bringing out ice water.

Not really knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.   The atmosphere here is very warm and welcoming. The staff is very friendly and will even engage in a conversation with customers. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful with us deciding what to eat. The decor of this place is most definitely interesting with artwork all along the wall and plants hanging in one section of the restaurant.     I decided to go with one of their burger options which was surprisingly good. What surprised me the most was the amount of food I ate and left there feeling really clean and wholesome inside. I honestly felt like I could go straight into workout (of course I didn't).  Other food we shared was the buffalo cauliflower wings and the spicy picante pineapple pizza.  I highly recommend trying both or pretty much anything off their menu.   This experience has opened my eyes a bit towards vegan good and in now way will I become vegan, but I now know there are some delicious and healthy vegan options out there that i'd enjoy. Even if you're not vegan, I highly recommend stopping by and giving this restaurant a try if ever in Vegas.",

I went for the meatball sub, my girlfriend got the chicken pie gnocchi, and we split the sushi. We wound up getting bread pudding for dessert.  Sushi: Bruh. Awesome. Pretty much impossible to tell it's vegan. A little wasabi and ginger would have made it perfect, but really, it didn't actually need it.   Meatball sub: The menu claims it's homemade, and maybe it is, but the meatballs were super similar to Gardein.. which is fine with me, they're delicious. The sauce soaked into the bomb ass bread, and with the \"cheese\" on top, it had a gooey sort of texture. The sub came with a side of fries that had a cajun-y seasoning with a side of curry ketchup. It was a bunch of weird flavors that I thought only I thought would go well together, but apparently not. My one critique would be I wish the wedges were a little thinner. A couple felt a little underdone in the middle.   Chicken pie gnocchi: Good stuff. It's oddly slightly sweet, so I felt like it needed hot sauce for heat and acid, but I enjoyed the few bites I had. The chicken inside looked and tasted like Beyond, but that's fine with me.   Bread pudding: Not a huge fan of sweets, but this was pretty good. Hot and, dare I say, M O I S T, with ice cream, and a bunch of fruit. Muy bueno.   VegeNation is awesome, and I really hope they franchise. The whole menu sounded delicious, and I'm willing to bet it all would be. Another definite visit for me when I come back to Vegas.",

    "text": "VegeNation was so good that I ended up going to both locations within my five day trip!   I'm a vegetarian from Toronto where there are a lot of vegetarian restaurants, but none hold a candle to VegeNation. For Vegas the prices are very reasonable, and I love the variety of food. When a salad seems to be one of the least popular items at a vegan place you know that it's good!   First trip we had the save the tuna sushi rolls, the Mexican hummus, the berry smoothie and the tofu curry bowl. Really enjoyed the sushi rolls (mainly because of the unique purple rice!) and we loved how generous the portion of the Mexican hummus was. The curry bowl was thicker than I'm used to and probably my least favourite item, but I am from Toronto where IMO there's some of the best Thai food in North America.   The second trip we had the berry smoothie, the chocolate smoothie, the buffalo cauliflower and the sushi rolls (we tried to get the Bao but it was sold out). Again, everything was great! I have no idea how the \"ranch\" dip that came with the buffalo cauliflower was vegan, it was so creamy and paired with the cauliflower perfectly!   It's definitely worth the trip off the strip, especially if you're vegan/vegetarian.",

VegeNations cauliflower was drowning in greasy sauce. The cauliflower was kind of chewy. It focused too much on spice, and not the whole of it together. I was let down. The togarashi fries were lackluster. They were hit or miss seasoned with a too spicy togarashi spice, while totally lacking in salt.  I don't think I would order either again. Maybe if I had t already enjoyed the Blinders wings first, I would have enjoyed these more.",

This is a great Vegan place to take non vegans, because you cant tell that this food does not have animal products.   What I got:  Bao Wow - Maybe the best thing I had out of all of it. Two \"pork\" buns, perfectly marinated mushroom and tofu on a super fluffy bun! Save the Tuna - Fish-less sushi roll! It was huge, with lots of fillings, you don't even miss the fish. Hot Tamale - Two delicious tamales! My Little Dumpling - Five steamed dumplings in a circle bamboo steamer, with a dipping sause East West Tacos - Three Korean BBQ flavor Tacos. They were huge! I think this was my second favorite out of the five items I got.  The atmosphere is so cute! Everything is clean and spread out with lots of green plants and natural light. This place is worth going to Downtown Vegas for!  Update: I now go to this place every time I'm in Vegas! Ive tried over half the menu, ALL amazing!",

The only thing I have to say that is anyway a critique is the prices are a bit on the higher side, nothing too expensive, just a bit more than average.   Overall, a very lovely, upbeat, and delicious place to enjoy a meal! We will most definitely be coming back (:",

    "text": "I am shocked...SHOCKED I TELL YOU...that I haven't yet written a review for VegeNation. My husband was working in Las Vegas for a couple of months, so I visited the city a few times. Every time, I had to come here, usually more than once. I brought a not-yet-vegan friend here and even she was blown away. For weeks, when we'd talk about getting together in LA, she'd lament, \"Why is VegeNation so...far...away...?\" I know, it hurts.  I've eaten a lot of food here, but here are some of my favorites that have stuck with me.  DANIEL NEGREANU: maybe the best meatball sub I've ever had in my life. Every time I order a sub elsewhere, it disappoints in comparison. The meatballs are amazing. I remember asking if they make them themselves and I think they said yes. I just remember being soooo impressed with how meaty they were.  BAO WOW: umami heavenly goodness. My mouth is watering just thinking of them. It's a flavor explosion tucked in a fluffy bao.  SEITAN CHICKEN & WAFFLES: best brunch item I've ever had. It's not on the regular menu but based on reviews, it's often available. If you see it, get it. Spicy, sweet, meaty - it hits all the notes.  TIRAMISU: this is one of those dishes that I can't help but order whenever I find a vegan version, it's just irresistible to me. I was too full from feasting to eat dessert there, so I took this to go to eat later in my hotel room while watching trashy TV. The layers of mascarpone are wonderful.   If I had one complaint, it's that the french fries that come as a side are not all cooked properly. They're really thick steak fries, seasoned really well, but they miss the mark when they're still tough on the inside. Thankfully, they come free with your entree so if there had to be a shortcoming anywhere, that's not bad.  I love the earthy, hip ambience, and I've been treated to excellent live music a few times. They have a great happy hour (buy one get one free) and street parking is a breeze. This is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

My husband looooves the veggie burger. It's heart and extremely tasty. I love the sweet potato quesadilla.. their ranch is almost too good too! Yummm!!   We always get the cauliflower bites and they never disappoint. Tried making them at home and it didn't work as well.! Please do yourself a favor and eat them.

Every Sunday this is our routine: we go in around 10am, before the brunch rush while it's pleasantly quiet, grub on the best chicken and waffles, walk to Public Us, drive home, and take a long nap.   We always get 1 order of French toast and 2 orders of chicken and waffles.    Chicken and waffles - 5.  With extra secret sauce to dip the potatoes in and drizzle over the chicken. It's legit.   Stuffed French toast - 5.    Hibiscus punch - 5.  Don't usually like hibiscus because it's too tangy but this is perfectly sweet.    Breakfast burrito - 4.5   Everything else on the menu is so boring.  Like the potatoes that go with breakfast - no salt, completely meh.  How do you screw up potatoes?! It's edible with the extra secret sauce but not the red ketchup sauce that comes with it.",

Kudos to Chef Donald and the rest of the crew. The buffalo cauliflower wings were actually spicy and delicious (unlike many I've tried at countless other vegan spots). The Bao Wow buns were tasty and satisfying. The Mediterranean pizza was done really well without sacrificing the integrity of the traditional pizza taste but with the Mediterranean twist. The pot pie brought back memories of my youth...just like my mom used to make it, but without the dead birds! And the cheesecake! Just try it! Can't wait to come back to Vegas and go back to VegeNation.",

I am not vegan but my husband has been for the past 6 months so I'm trying all these places with him and most vegan places haven't got breakfast wrong...anyway we ordered the tamales and Mexican hummus for starters - both really good. The \"chicken\" & waffles were also good. The texture of the chicken was the best that I've had so far (just needed a little bit more seasoning) and the waffles were soft and delicious.   The apple cobbler gets 3 stars...it was actually just apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla ice...it was missing the cobbler (crust) and cream but again I'm not vegan so I was comparing to the real deal.  Would definitely eat here again when we're in town!",

    "text": "While visiting Las Vegas, we had dinner at VegeNation. It was a cute little store front restaurant very close to downtown Vegas, close to Friemont Street. Very clean and casual modern, water drinks were served in small mason jars.  Our server Letitia was very friendly and hard working, offering a suggestion of macaroni and cheese balls as the starter. My wife ordered the Holy Mole, (rice, beans, veggy meat, slaw and corn tortillas) and I ordered chicken pot pie. Menu was very manageable. With the dessert and tip, we paid $50.   Only problem was the food was bland. The Mac and cheese balls were fried in breading, no seasoning. My wife's rice was cold and the rest unseasoned. My pot pie was crustless but had dumplings in it.....extremely bland. We did not finish our food. The dessert was apple cobbler, apple , sugar and ice cream. No crust so it was actually not a cobbler.    I can only comment on what we ate but everything we ate was consistently bland. Garlic, onion, herbs, salt, pepper, any or all would help.  If food taste reflected great look and staffs great work, this place would be great. Passing on next trip.",

By no means am I vegan or vegetarian, but I practice it. I'm going to practice more by coming here!!  The minute you walk in you get a very bohemian lower manhattan feel. Low music, great clientele, beautiful restaurant set up. I was greeted today but the most bubbly and personable host. I totally wish she was my server too.  My server Romario was really good. At some moments he seemed nervous but other than that he suggested great things and checked on us plenty.   The food was AMAZE-BALLS. We had the vegan sushi with forbidden rice. Literally great tasting sushi for a great price. Plus it was a whole roll so it was good alone or to split. We also had the homemade spicy buffalo cauliflower. The sauce was good, a little too tangy but still delicious. The cauliflower was cooked well and served with a side of vegan ranch dressing.  For entrees my partner had the Gnocchi chick'n pot pie. It was delicious. The gnocchi acted as the bread/carb. So all you needed was everything else mixed together. He really enjoyed it. I had the chick'n and waffles which was literally better than any chicken and waffles I've ever had. The sauce on this was a mix of mayo, syrup and jalapenos. All together fantastic combo.   I wish I wasn't so full that I coulda slid dessert in, but hey there is always next time ;)  BTW when you check in on yelp free sangria :)",

My husband had the Curry Noodle bowl and I had the Thursday only special of a Chimichanga. The chimichanga was really good. I wanted to take the leftovers back to the hotel but we didnt have a fridge and microwave. My husband didn't care for his Curry bowl as it had cellophane noodles, which he doesn't like and it wasn't stated on the menu.  The coconut sauce and the veggies were good, which he ate. I got the feeling they make substitutions for some ingredients as needed, however they don't inform you that they are going to do so.  The service was really good and we would definately return.",

And being that I'm vegan (and hubby is a great sport at accompanying me on vegan adventures!), this place sounded perfect. Not only were the pho and dumplings the BEST, Vegenation has the best fruit topped French toast - complete with this sweet dipping sauce!   The service is also great! Art was our waiter and he made us feel very comfy. He knew it was our first time visiting and we liked how attentive he was with us. We must have sounded like a broken record; we kept repeating how amazing everything tasted!   The mango tea was very refreshing, especially for a hot day in July! I really can't wait to come back and try the other drinks.  The overhead music was also on point! It was dope to hear Odezsa, SBTRKT and Disclosure while I was munching away. Add a real awesome ambience to the mix and you have heaven, right in downtown Vegas.   One last thing: I love the art! They have one of a pig with the words, \"friend, not food\" added on it. Love!   I can't wait to go back. I'm still tinged and can honestly eat that pho every day. And the dumplings. And French toast...",

    "text": "My vegan friends, look no further, this is a great place to have your vegetables and eat them too.  Even if you're not vegan, the food here is great and worth a try to anyone looking for a different kind of afternoon meal.  The atmosphere is great, they have a nice set up that includes lots of plants and decor but nothing too overbearing, and the waiting staff is really nice. Our waiter was super cool and open about explaining everything on the menu and what's in it.   Everything on the menu is vegan and it all sounded great I wanted to try EVERYTHING. For the appetizer my friend and I shared their \"Save the tuna\" sushi roll and it's was probably my favorite thing served there thus far.  For entrees, she got the mushroom sliders(which I had a taste of and were AWESOME) and I had the \"Out of Africa\" curry dish. It had a nice blend of flavors and wasn't too spicy, but still tasty. (I'll have to ask next time if they can adjust levels of spicyness, I like my curry ON FIIREEE)  Even though we were both stuffed by the end of our meal, I knew I couldn't leave this place without getting some dessert. Choco tocos were the go-to for a quick tasting, they were small and cute and just enough for someone that want's a sweet snack but you know you're too full to eat anything else. Unless you're like me who keeps eating after they are full, cause I'm a terrible person.  The salted caramel choco tacos are great and there is quite a salty bite in them, so make sure you know what you're getting when you order them!   All in all, this place has hopes for being a new favorite of mine, I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu.",

My sister in law ordered the mushroom portobello burger and that was such a bomb dish too and she too wasn't filled. We tried to order a Mac and cheese for my niece but they were out so a chicken burger was what we ended up with and my niece approved the chicken minus the buns.

My only reason for 4/5 stars is that it definitely is more on the pricey side, especially for the small portions. I had a tea, sweet potato and cauliflower this last time and it was over $25 with tax and tip. The portions were quite small (the potato was maybe 3-4 bites) and I left still feeling a bit hungry.

    "text": "What a great, welcoming vibe and a fabulous menu! All the staff were super and the food was delicious enough to make us yearn for another trip to LV. If you are only in Las Vegas for a short time, make sure to make Vegenation one of your food destinations.   For appetizers, my partner and I had the antipasto platter and the hot tamales. The hot tamales were good. The antipasto platter featured the local virgin cheese, which was very good.  We longed for crackers of some sort to put the cheese on. As a kale chips fan, those on the platter were by far the worst I've ever had, but since the rest of the meal hit it out of the park, this was no more than a minor disappointment.   We ordered the East West tacos and the eggplant stacks with vegan ricotta and mozzarella in the middle for entrees. Both were absolutely delicious and we would happily order them again and again if we ever return to LV.   For dessert, we had the bread pudding and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was so creamy, rich and flavourful. We'd recommend a bit more coconut cream in the bread pudding, but it was still delicious, too.   Part of what made the meal so good was our highly knowledgeable and attentive server, David. He knew precisely what was in each dish and sold each item so well, he had us downright excited to try more dishes than we ever intended to order. Wish David could train the servers in restaurants where we live. He is a True professional.",

It's the perfect place to introduce the meat eaters in your family to a plant based lifestyle. I think my favorite aspect is that while there are a handful of items with \"meat alternatives\" there are even more items that let the veggies be the main attraction. The sweet potato quesadilla is awesome, cauliflower wings delicious, and the kids grilled cheese is insane (I tried my nephew's and I kinda want to order a grownup size next time). Probably the best vegan restaurant in Las Vegas.",

We arrived around 1:30 pm and were seated immediately. We both ordered the veggie burger, which we received less than 5 minutes after placing our orders. Had it been a cold dish, it wouldn't have bothered me as much. Was it microwaved?  I am no stranger to veggie burgers, but when the waiter set my plate in front of me I was a bit taken aback. The patty was red! I was also a little confused as to why we only received 4 french fries and a mound a ketchup. After about 3 minutes of mental preparation, i finally took a bite of the burger. It was actually decent. Not nearly as good as my favorite veggie burger from Lucille's, but it was tasty. There was a ton of flavor is the patty, and the burger was dressed with extra goodness. The consistency of the patty was off. I think the ingredient were precooked, chilled and free formed. The texture reminded me of baby food. The fries.. there weren't enough for me to to review, but I will give them an honorable mention.  The chef came out and asked us home the meal was, which was a lovely touch. The service was excellent. I would probably go back if I was with another Vegan.",

As someone who is not vegan or vegetarian I still found a few breakfast items that jumped out. I ordered the blueberry waffles with a cup of Sumatran coffee.   They bring the coffee out in a fancy press brewed to perfection, the waffles come out beautifully arranged on the plate dusted with cinnamon sugar. It accompiened with an organic blueberry sauce, maple syrup, and a bowl of fruit salad.   All and all very tasty, the portion was however on the smaller side. The atmosphere is very green and refreshing.   I will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner.",

The decor is spot on, with wooden accents and a green garden wall. The menu is concise and so very visually appealing. Everything is picture perfect.  Unfortunately, picture perfect doesn't cut it for me. I have two main gripes with this place:  1) The menu items are slightly overpriced for what you get. Not so much that it's outrageous, but just enough to make you wonder why that pasta dish wasn't the best pasta dish you've had all year.  2) The dishes were all wonderfully creative and beautifully presented, but every single one was missing something. They were good but just not very special.   Here's a rundown of what we got:  Downtown Tony (portobello mushroom sliders with a side of potato wedges and sriracha aioli) - mushroom flavored/cooked well, potato wedges ok, aioli pretty good, buns left something to be desired  Gotta Get Over the Hemp - tasted very average, sauce was good but nothing too special, pasta cooked well  Chocolate Tacos - salted caramel tasted weird, taco shell tasted so stale that at one point I thought I was consuming plastic, the cinnamon(?) and coconut did not compliment the chocolate or berries at all  Jamaican Hibiscus Punch - tart, slightly sweet, salty, spicy, and watered down. At least there were free refills?  I'll come back and try Vegenation again, but for now, it is just too expensive for the amount and flavor you get.",

I came here last Saturday for a quick bite to eat. It's adorable inside; industrial like feel with wood and metal pieces and an awesome wall of green. The hostess greeted us and said she will be right with us. I then noticed that she was playing buser as well as we waited. We were a party of 5 and didn't want to sit at the high tops because of my grandfather so we were okay with waiting for a larger table. We finally got seated by our server. The table had 1 menu and no silverware. It took about 10 minutes just to get water, again being brought out by the hostess. Our server, Letitia, I believe was her name, was AWESOME! She was full of life, energy and humor! She came to get our orders and was disappointed to find out by 11:30 the jackfruit tacos were sold out! I don't have a background in food purchasing but would hope people see trends in particular orders and would stock it accordingly. I was disappointed but moved on to my second choice Ellen Tacos. Food came out as it was ready, starting with the dumplings. This hostess was an all in one, she was now bringing out our food which she spilt soy sauce all over the table. It was clear that this establishment was extremely understaffed. I even got up to get the table 5 sets of silverware!  The food though was okay! The tacos had a lot of flavoring and crunch. The mixture was a blend of nuts. If you have consistency phobia I recommend staying away. It was almost like a tuna fish texture to a sense. But my absolute favorite was the sweet potato quesadilla! It's that sweeter option entry as to why I was only able to eat it as an appetizer.  Although they need to focus on staffing and food inventory this place is still a must try and to at least say you tried it.",

I bought 35 dollars on this trip and at first I couldn't find my coupon I made it all the way to my car, because my order was to go, when I found it I went back inside, mind you I'm disabled I walked with a cane, and showed it to the manager on duty at that time and she said because my order was to go and the free sangria was only for dine in. I pointed out that it says that no where on the coupon and she said well that's the policy. I didn't argue with her I just turned around and left but I thought she was very rude, disrespectful, and I felt so dismissed. That's no way to treat a paying customer, especially if you want them to return. Now I didn't catch the manager's name but she was on duty at 6pm. The food was great but the service has to be up to pare also. Will I return I don't know but if I do I hope service has gotten better.",

I am currently, vegetarian, but I used to eat meat and this sandwich was as good as any meatball sub and WAY MORE socially conscious and healthy.  Great marina and flaky, perfectly toasted sourdough bread. But that wasn't all: we followed up with the Brownie Sundae, which was to die for.  I told my friend that this was now our restaurant and that we had to order all of the same things again. Seriously one of the best meals i have had overall. Every single course was well worth it and something i HAVE to have again. What more can we say. AND the bill was reasonable; the place cozy and chic; the staff pleasant and we saved animals in the meantime. You HAVE to try this place. Tell them Aubrey and Kathy sent you.",

    "text": "This place is somewhere NOT to take your omnivore friends trying to convince them that being vegan is cheap LOL.  To be perfectly honest, when I had watched some vlogs or reviews of this restaurant on social media or youtube I had really high expectations for the food. Vloggers really overhyped this restaurant, possibly for more exposure. We visited on Sunday June 25th, lovely atmosphere, great sounding live acoustic guitar singer, air conditioning, and really clean! The restaurant was not too busy, and service was good.  I was craving desserts and wanted to try the tamales so here are some concise reviews on the various items my family and I tried...  Tamales 3.5/5, Amazing but pricey..for two micro-mini tamales. Came nice and warm, yummy masa, reminded me of meat tamales I used to have! Would recommend if you miss tamales!  Black bean hummus and chips 5/5, Yummy! Try this because it is so tasty! More chips please!  Blueberry Cheesecake 1/5, Ehhh, aesthetically pleasing nevertheless it was ehh and gritty.   Carrot cake 000000/5, No. Pretty, but NO. I am not totally sure if this was supposed to be a raw vegan carrot cake, but being frank, it was pretty much just the carrot grinds that were a result of juiced carrots, put together in a small cake form with cinnamon to resemble a carrot cake. Cashew creme frosting was ehh, gritty though. Expensive for not reason. Gag worthy...  Tiramisu 3/5. Yummy cause it had notes of coffee. I added some of my cold brew to it and it made it a 4/5 hahahha, would recommend adding more chocolate and coffee to this though. I enjoyed this!  I also had a black cold brew (Free refills), which was really excellent and perfectly strong AND kept me hyped all day!  If you are vegan or a curious omnivore in the Vegas area I would say give it a go, try it out. Most likely going to skip this on my next vegas visit. But, it was a good experience.",

I now  eat  whole food plant based diet, no oil sugar or salt.  I gave it all up, and I thought no more eating out except for salad with no dressing.  I am greatful to VegeNation, it has opened up a whold new world of eating out again. I enjoyed and the spagetti and meatballs, so good, the pene is subtituted is gluten free, and on their menu guiede there are serveral dishes that are oil free as well.  The cheese plate was delcious, and cocktails are availble.   Eat here to save your life and save the planet.",

It's a stew of yams, chickpeas, quinoa, kale, peanuts and spices that's filling, nutritious, and tasty. Other dishes are also quite good, such as the tamales. My only real criticism is that the menu descriptions are lacking. If there's a strong flavor in a dish it should be mentioned but often isn't. For instance, the gnocchi they're serving now is topped with nutritional yeast but that's not mentioned on the menu. It's a strong flavor, like cilantro or eggplant, and should be mentioned.",

When we asked if there was any chance we could put in a quick order of French toast for our son-even though it was 11-she said dryly, \"no\". We decided to order, but get our son breakfast somewhere else. Order took a while-place was nearly empty. Watched people wait at front for seating-many staff walked by but no one helped them. Food served finally and was terrible. Couldn't get past one bite on either of the dishes: Pamela Anderson and jackfruit tacos. Both very plain cold and no sauce. Asked for anything to flavor it and was offered 2 options: sriracha or BBQ sauce. Been vegetarians for 30 years and this was not only the worst meal we've ever had-but also the worst service. Server seemed oblivious to our asking for the bill after one bite-or played stupid (or was stupid). Too bad-because it appeared someone who looked like an owner was around helping when we first arrived-but as soon as she was out the door everything fell apart. Was looking for great vegan grub to get us all the way to Moab and left after one bite. Went to MTO Cafe where they served up a storm and was beyond professional and friendly!",

The interior of the restaurant was clean with a modern hippie activist vibe, and it was packed in there.   I got the East meets West tacos and they were incredible - sweet and spicy, and the jackfruit made them really interesting. They also held up well despite taking them through airport security. In addition, we got the non-tuna sushi roll which was much smaller than expected, but also very delicious. I was hoping there would be more though - it looked so small and sad in the take-out box!   Last of all, the blueberry cheesecake. It was good, but it melted into a sad puddle of goop during the hour or so it took from the restaurant to get to our gate. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas and try sitting down and eating there.",

The sauce is perfectly spicy, and the syrup calms everything down. The best vegan chicken and waffles I've had (surprisingly, have tried many), perfect, sturdy, crispy waffles with a patty of 'chicken' which was nicely fried. If you can eat it as a sandwich, I salute you.  My boyfriend liked his African stew/soup as well, and there was enough of it that we had leftovers. Marinating didn't hurt it a bit! Delicious.  Red, our server, was extra nice and friendly, and we really appreciated her no-nonsense style.   They had the only two brunch cocktails that matter, a simple Bloody Mary & mimosa. Didn't see other alcohol options but this place is really about the food.  Wishing them booming business! We'll be back!",

It's amazing food that doesn't come with the guilt of eating out, and they hype you up about not eating dairy or meat (which I tear up both of those when I'm not there). But this standalone is really amazing without having to be vegan, my go to things to order are the hot Tamale, save the tuna, and the dumpling. But you really can't go wrong with any of the starters, I absolutely love their pizza, the pineapple picante is my favorite (but don't expect it to taste like a standard pizza). The staff is super nice so I would be sure to tip because they deserve it. He kept refilling my chia seed coconut water lemonade (which is another reason I go there), I almost felt bad because he kept coming back to refill it. Also the deserts you can't go wrong with those, my go to is the brownie Sunday. If you're downtown or far away, I would highly recommend it.",

The Food Not Bombs Bowl is mostly just potatoes and the flavor is a little lacking - 3/5 The Bao Wow has pretty well seasoned tofu and mushrooms - 3.5/5 The Brownie Sundae has 2 scoops of ice cream that aren't too bad. The brownie is very much a dark chocolate-y bitter-y flavor which i liked, especially since the ice cream is sweet. And the toppings are good - 3.5/5 The Carrot Cake is not what I expected. I think it's completely raw, so the texture is very much like cold mush - 1.5/5",

To date, my favorite meal has to be the \"Chicken\"-N-Waffles. It comes with a side of giant fries, their signature ketchup, and a creamy sauce that is heaven! Now because it's only offered on Saturdays, I come here every Saturday! I've been on a 3 week chicken-n-waffle streak. Nuff said.   Now when I'm in the mood for something else, the \"Meatball\" grinder is also amazing! Comes with the giant fries too. (SN: Ask for a side of the creamy \"Chicken\"-N-Waffles sauce). It's the best mix of savory and sweet.   Now, dessert. Whatever you do, you must get the ice cream sundae. First time I had it, I had to call our waitress back and verify with her that this was actually a vegan restaurant and not a vegetarian restaurant! I will say without flinching, it's better than Blue Bell ice cream. If you've had Blue Bell, you're probably scoffing right now. But try it, then try scoffing.  I'll be back again and again and again.",

Everything I have had on the menu from tamales, salads, meatball sandwiches, sushi, cocktails, etc. was fantastic. They understand the rising demand for vegan restaurants and meet the expectations of delicious quality food that even non-vegans will enjoy,",

Only thing they did not like was the ketchup. I had the sliders!! Holy Goodness.. Our server was great an attentive. We got seated right away. The Decor is very cute, it almost feels like you're in a small beach city type of vibe. We had a great experience!!",

    "text": "I found Vegenation while looking for vegan options other than my usual Wynn restaurants and I am SO glad I did!    My husband and I went around 7pm on Memorial Day.  I was afraid it would be hard to find parking, but we easily found a spot right in front of the restaurant and headed in.    The hostess was friendly and offered us indoor or outdoor patio seating.  We chose indoor.  I love the aesthetic of the restaurant!  The tables, lighting, plants, everything.  Our server quickly came over to greet us and take our drink order.  My husband ordered the Jamaican Hibiscus Punch and it was AMAZING!  Perfect blend of sweet and a slight savory-ness to it.  Since it was our first time dining here, we asked the server for his suggestions on what to order.  He was very knowledgable and definitely steered us in a great food direction.    Onto the food... -For appetizers we had the Mexican Hummus and Hot Tamales.  Both were amazing!  I was actually really shocked at how great both were.  The tamales had the perfect blend of spices.   -For one entree we went for the East West Tacos which were bbq jackfruit.  My husband who is usually a carnivore, was severely impressed by these!  Texture was great and the flavor was fantastic!  Homemade tortillas.  Total score.   -Our other entree was the Casa Blanca.  Quinoa and Moroccan spiced veggies.  The spices were great.  Good amount of heat, but not too overpowering.  I make a lot of dishes like this at home and I was still impressed.   Food and service were both fantastic.  Good prices.  I love that everything is non GMO!  We will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas!",

They are still good without being fried :)",

    "text": "VegeNation is simply wonderful - and it is much more than your average restaurant. Chef Donald and his team are spearheading a movement full of flavor, quality ingredients, local sourcing, nutritious offerings, caring, artistry and authenticity. And full of value, especially given the moderate prices.  Last night's appetizers included the Save the Tuna, Bao Wow, the Mexican Hummus, My Little Dumpling, and Hot Tamale. While my personal favorites were the Hot Tamale [great, flavorful masa with a symphony of spices] and the Mexican hummus [hearty comfort food, complete with a roasted jalapeno on the side], every selection was gorgeous in presentation, bursting with wonderful ingredients and thoroughly satisfying.   No buyer's remorse here! Try any menu item and you will want to return to try ALL the others!!  While I was fortunate to sample all the appetizers, they were so satisfying and filling that I did not have much room for an entree. But, in the \"community's interest.\" I determined to try an entree in order to share my thoughts with others. :)  Especially since every entree served to the other diners looked so tempting, I took my time before deciding upon the Out of Africa yam stew. Turned out to be a wonderful choice of hearty, wholesome deliciousness. I am not one to snap & dine, so I will encourage everyone to SEE for themselves how gorgeous & colorful this dish is, how ample the portions are, how comforting & appealing it is. It was simply a wonderful dish. I heartily recommend it; it is now a go to, must have dish for me to seek out on a regular basis.   Other reviewers will be sure to post ample photos and many others will be available on the VegeNation Facebook & Instagram pages. By contrast, the only photo i will supply will be of the living wall - which is in the patio at the rear of the restaurant. Because for me and for the entire Las Vegas community the little living wall portends what stunningly important contributions that VegeNation and its visionary chef and team will make toward the resiliency, health, sustainability & nutritional understanding of everyone who walks through the front of VegeNation.  VegeNation is not only feeding stomachs, it is nurturing the soul and, simultaneously, educating the minds of of its clientele. It is not serving meals, it truly is spearheading a movement that will transform lives. Seriously.   This is not just an experiment in the vegan lifestyle for all its diners - it is the unfolding of a visionary chef's dream to share his own voyage of using his extraordinary knowledge of nutrition and the \"alchemy\" of cooking to transform his own life and thereby place his bout with cancer into remission. VegeNation truly is the culmination of decades of Chef Donald's dedication to living life to its fullest & in his sharing what he has learned and achieved with the world.  Chef Donald & his handpicked team have created a community center on sustainable eating, local production & resiliency.  And the not simple living green wall in the rear of the patio of VegeNation portends much, much more to come.  To be continued.   VegeNation offers so much, but it is sure to keep offering even more.",

    "text": "If a vegetarian/vegan restaurant can convince my bacon and meat loving husband that he's eating \"meat\", they deserve kudos points.   This is probably one of the better vegetarian restaurants I've been to. They're located a block outside the downtown container park. The menu has plant based takes on classic dishes such as pho, chicken & waffles, pizza, and buffalo wings. Their ingredients are local from gardens and schools they sponsor, as well as their own garden.   We grabbed a second lunch here and ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings and save the tuna. We enjoyed both dishes and especially my husband, who usually yelps vegetarian places just for me. The choice of cauliflower was perfect for \"wings\" as it's \"meaty\". The buffalo sauce had a nice kick. The save the tuna tasted like actually sushi! My husband surely couldn't tell the difference.   Check in with Yelp for a free spiked apple cider. This is Las Vegas after all. The alcohol content wasn't strong but perfect for me. I wish there was VegeNation back home in DC as they have some unique takes for a vegetarian place.",

I'm going to be thinking about that chicken piccata for a long time...and I guess I'll have to just come back for the cheeseburger tacos or the mac daddy burger. Also the staff were all very kind and helpful. I pledge allegiance to VegeNation!",

All three were delicious, but there was something soothing about the CBD tea(probably the CBD).   Then we had pineapple sausage pizza, mac & cheese burger(special), and buffalo cauliflower wings.  The pizza was the standout and I dont even like pineapple on pizza. It was phenomenal. Out waitress forgot to order the first pizza with gluten free crust, so she left the first pizza on the table free of charge and brought out the gluten free one a little bit later. The cauliflower was a little cold but still tasty, and the ranch was great.  Pretty incredible that everything here is plant based.  Will definitely be back when in Vegas.",

Expectations started to run high which can sometimes be a dangerous thing. I'm happy to report, VegeNation met my high expectations!  Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi sounded very unique. I think I prefer the pasta potato dumplings to a pie crust. The flavor truly blew me away! It's cashew-cream based, savory, seasoned with rosemary, with chunks of \"chicken\" and veggies. Loved this! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kObZzo&s=26463ae6dd2044aa616c275ff9e1f729eae8df711006fb8f44af1e8710e29df4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kObZzo</a>  The Meateater BF ordered the Sweet Potato Quesadilla. This is one of those dishes that makes me ask, \"why didn't I think of that!?!\" Sweet potato puree and vegan cheese melted in a wheat tortilla. Yum! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2klFR9h&s=c3c920b449fb9be434cc797eb315720f78f7ff33f169d1bb6eb4117a029e5ffa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2klFR9h</a>  We also took advantage of the Yelp check it offer: Spiked Apple Cider <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2joSSzT&s=2d600b0ef07976242fc759ce73ebfd89f1150dd798b8903f31b279f4e7fd3388\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2joSSzT</a>  Bellies were already happily full but we couldn't resist getting the Chocolate Tacos. Chocolate pudding in a tiny crispy shell with a sprinkle of chocolate granola. I think the shell was made of phyllo dough. I appreciated that this dessert was slightly on the lighter side. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2joM7xU&s=6c583f5f5255a39a109bcbc3f361e4f297c2d76c3e5668906274ddc89eb2535b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2joM7xU</a>  Awesome vibe! I dig this place! I hope to eat here every time I'm in Vegas. Or perhaps VegeNation can open a location in LA :)",

Makes you feel welcome and her suggestions and professionalism are great.  you all know how it is that the service can make or break a place.  Nikki definitely makes it an easy choice to eat at VegeNation for sure.  2. 2 for 1 Bloody Mary's.  Need I say any more?  These things are great and they have a nice slice of chili right in them for a good heat.  Can't beat the price.  3.  We ordered some to eat-in and to take home.  My Little Dumplings, Bow Wow, Save the Tuna, Chicken and Waffles, The Downtown Tony, Pho King Delicious.    All I can say is that this place is probably one of my favorite restaurants, no matter if you are Vegan or not, and I am certainly not Vegan.  I just enjoy quality food, great service, creative tasty foods that are hearty and not so focused on trendy alone.  The food here is hearty and trendy and that is a unique quality to have.  Everyone be sure to come back, many times.  And, if you come at 11:00 before the crowds, on weekends, the parking is just fine.  GK Says, check it out again, and again.",

Lots of vegan restaurants DOUSE their foods in salt and if you are a vegan foodie you will notice, the clean taste of the items!  APPETIZERS: we ordered the pot-stickers, the buffalo cauliflower, and the sweet potato tamales. ALL THREE WERE SUPERB! But the buffalo cauliflower took the cake!

I ordered the chicken and waffles and my non-vegan husband had a smoothie (he claimed he wasn't too hungry ). My food was seriously amazing! I'm pretty new to veganism and I couldn't tell it wasn't actual chicken! The look, taste and texture was so real. The breading on the chicken was delicious and crunchy, the sauce inside had the perfect spicy kick and the holy was great for dipping it all in. The waffle and fries were both so yummy, too! My husband loved his dark purple berry smoothie and happily finished the rest of my food (it may not seem like a ton when it comes out on the plate but I was starving and still couldn't eat it all by myself)! I loved the atmosphere, and service was efficient with super friendly servers  Can't wait to visit again and try something new because everything Is saw looked amazing!",

Now that I have your attention I want to start by saying how me and my cousin were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who did not hesitate to take us to our table.   Then moments after met a waitress (I forgot her name she was wonderful) that gave us details of the specials without us even asking. She made us feel very comfortable gave us great suggestions and even educated us on the ingredients of the food.  No judging .... we started with the buffalo cauliflower wings and tamale they were so tasty and fresh. Next my cousin had the pineapple picante pizza which was good but could have been even better if the crust weren't too burnt. I had the meatball grinder the bread was a little hard around the edges but let me tell you the sauce and cheeses and meatballs were perfect!! Finally we ended with the brownie sundae it's a must especially when we found out the brownie was made of black bean (what??? How?? That was so good)!   I will for sure be returning and if you're in town it's a must try !",

    "text": "Well we woke up wanting a real hearty breakfast so the wife suggested Vegenation.....which turned out to be hot spot #2 on my week long VEGAN Excursion...... and we were not disappointed. Despite the fact that they were supposed to be serving Sunday Brunch....they did have a \"POP UP\" option of Chicken and Waffles. We decided to go with that and I have to tell you it was simply the best VEGAN Chicken and Waffles I have EVER had. The Waffles were drenched in Vegan Butter.....Gardein Chicken in the middle (so good) and potato wedges. We had hot sauce.....ketchup.....and maple syrup to go with our meal not to mention if you check in on YELP you received a free spiked Apple Cider.   Now be advised you may need a little salt with your potato wedges.....they served us this awesome pink salt and speaking of being served our waiter was AWESOME. There is literally no FREE Parking in downtown Las Vegas.....so you have to pay 2 bucks for an hour of parking if you want to eat at this establishnment. However VegeNation will reimburse you the 2 bucks for parking.....how AWESOME is that!!!!!! Funny thing I was so excited about the meal and how great it tasted I didn't even ask how much I would be paying.....LOL!!!! Turns out it was 12.95 per person plus tip.....so all in all it was only about 30 bucks total and I was completely happy with that.  I definitely plan on returning this week and if your looking for some quality VEGAN food for Breakfast at least......well your search is over. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!",

We're not fans of the stereotypical Vegas tourism scene, or the meat-centric casino-related restaurants that dominate the area (just  stayed on Fremont street to be close to the wedding venue). We were so relieved when we found VegeNation. We came back multiple times during our stay and loved everything we tried there.   Standouts include the Food Not Bombs Bowl, Chicky Chicky Bang Bang (there is some magical flavor that really ties it together in a surprising and delightful way...I think it's in the pickles); Peaches 'n' Cheese Crepes; Par-Fabulous, and Stuffed French Toast.  The fries are also phenomenal--BIG cuts of potatoes with crispy sides. The coffee is great (both hot and cold brew).   The service is great. The decor is clean and calming (especially compared to the loud, blaring, smoky, sensory overload we were stuck in for most of the our days in the Fremont Street area). If I am ever in Las Vegas again, I will be sure to return to VegeNation.",

My boyfriend and I stopped by here on a road trip back home, after exploring and hiking Valley of Fire, not having eaten for 8 hours. Needless to say, we were STARVING.   We started with the famous burger, Pamela Anderson super green tacos, and the Perky Potion, everything to share. Everything was ABSOLUTELY delicious. The Perky Potion is a unique coffee mixture with tea, hemp seeds, and other ingredients and I couldn't get over how good it was, to the point where I will be trying the mixture at home! The burger was unlike any vegan burger Ive ever had, and tasted like my sister's burgers. She purchases great quality patties from Whole Foods, and grills them during BBQs. When I still ate meat, I used to crave them as they tasted SO much better than the average burger.  The portions were on the slightly smaller side, and once we devoured everything in 10 minutes, we decided to order the Tamale appetizer. It was also delicious!  Our server was also extremely sweet and helpful in choosing our dishes!  The only downside to this experience was knowing that we don't have VegeNation in Los Angeles. Please open one up here.",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to eat here and I was not disappointed! My husband loved it too!  This is a sit-down (or to go) restaurant near the Container Park. My husband and I went to eat here on a Saturday around 1 PM. It was packed and the wait was around 20 minutes. A wait is expected in downtown where most dining establishments are the size of a studio apartment. This place has to be around 300 feet of actual dining space. The wait is worth it! I suggest when it is hot out to get on the wait list and go back and sit in your car until they page you on your cell. There isn't a waiting area inside. No stars negated as this is expected in the downtown re-vamped area -- so tourists please keep this in mind.   Our waitress was busy yet efficient, nice and knowledgeable. She forgot silverware but most of the food can be eaten without it. We ordered the Mexican Hummus, Chia Lemonade, Save The Tuna, Mama Mia, and Pamela Anderson.   Hubby is not a veggie head and he was insanely shocked on how realistic the \"meatballs\" tasted. I inquired about the ingredients and was told it was a soy/gluten mix. Per my husband he stated that anyone can be \"bam-booze-led\" into eating here thinking they were eating real balls.   The Mexican Hummus is not spicy if you get the whole jalapeno on the side. The chips are blue corn and made fresh. The hummus is thick and the f***ing bomb.   Save The Tuna: Protein-packed vegan friendly \"sushi\" roll. It does fall apart easily so I suggest pouring the side sauce over rather than dip. That's my only qualm because the taste is sweet and will blow your taste buds away!  Pamela Anderson: Just unbelievably delicious. I was already stuffed by time I got my entree. I wish I had a bigger stomach because this was just tantalizing!   Overall, as a vegetarian I am obsessed with this place. I can actually come back here and order something different multiple times. My husband states he would actually come back and try a few different entrees as well. This place is a great way to introduce vegetarianism to little ones or anyone who wants \"something different.\"",

    "text": "In a city with a restaurant called the \"Heart Attack Grill\" (I assume it means they serve unhealthy portions of red meat and fried food) it was great to find a decent Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant within a short walk of Fremont Street and our downtown hotel.   We arrived at 7:00pm on a Saturday evening and VegeNation was packed. A few high top seats were open but my son (who was hobbled by skiing accident the previous week) said, \"Let's wait for a regular table.\" The hostess said, \"Fifteen minutes,\" but it was only nine or ten minutes until a table opened up. So far so good. It is important for a hostess to have an accurate sense of when tables will become available.  Everything on the menu looked tasty. When I spotted tamales on the starter course menu my mouth started watering. Unfortunately they had eighty-sixed the tamales by the time we arrived -- so I ordered my second choice -- Bao Wow. It was the best dish of the evening. The tofu was nicely fried and seasoned with an Asian style BBQ sauce. The spinach and shiitake mushrooms brought both umami and sauciness to the dish. We shared the order as an appetizer, but for many diners the plate would be good a lunch sized portion, or, along with an another starter (or several) you could create your own \"small plate\" or \"tasting menu\" meal for a party of one or more.  For my entree I ordered \"Downtown Tony,\" three portobello mushroom sliders with togarashi fries and a curry ketchup dipping sauce. My son ordered the \"Daniel Negreanu,\" a \"meatball\" grinder.  \"Downtown Tony\" was an excellent concept (I actually recreated it in my home kitchen several days later) but unfortunately it came up short in execution. One of the three sliders only had enough mushroom to cover half of the bun (fortunately the bread was very good). The tiny, dime sized dollops of sriracha aioli on the bottom of each bun were insufficient and did not bring any flavor or creaminess to the party. The slaw was crisp and tangy but it sucked up the aioli. These days, when you take a bite of a properly prepared burger (be it a vegan mushroom slider or half-pounder of prime Kobe beef), every mouthful from the first bite to the last should should include discernible and balanced proportions of the \"burger,\" the bread, the garnish(es) and the condiment(s). The chef at VegeNation needs to be more generous with everything between the top and bottom of the bun to reach five star status.  The chef also needs to work on the torgarashi fries. To start with -- add enough toragashi to actually flavor the fries. Secondly, they need to be  uniformly cooked. At least three quarters of my serving were almost burnt on on side. Seeing this I saved the one that was evenly browned on all sides for last -- only to take a bite and find that it was undercooked and nearly raw in the center. The curry ketchup dipping sauce was rather thin and watery and weakly flavored.   I had a bite of my son's grinder and the flavor and texture seemed to be spot on. But he reports that his fries were sub-par as well.  All in all we did leave satisfied. Our overall experience was good and I'd definitely eat here again. Were it not for some technical mis-steps in the kitchen I would rate VegeNation four stars or better.",

Tamales were fine, nothing to write home about, but had some flavor.   The chia lemonade came after the appetizers, but it was good, not that sweet, but I kind of liked that.   The entrees only need one word though: bland.  We got the meatball sub which was edible, just needed a little seasoning. The mac and cheese burger was a giant let down though.  I order vegan burgers way too frequently, and this was probably the worst. The mac and cheese was wet and tasted like nothing. The collard greens also tasted like nothing. And the side of fries had no salt either, thus tasted like nothing.   I asked for salt which helped a tiny bit, but I think the disappointment ruined it for me. A server nicely asked if I wanted something else, but I wasn't in the mood to wait, or to be disappointed again.  The lava cake dessert was amazing, so I did end on a good note, but I would probably never come back here as there are so many other vegan options in Vegas.",

    "text": "We ended up having breakfast and lunch here in the same day.  The set up is cute and the staff were all nice.  Breakfast was the berry stuffed french toast for the hubs and the tofu scramble for me.  The hubs enjoyed his meal and mine was very satisfying (I think my hubs might have liked mine a tad more than his which is ironic since he's usually a sucker for SFT).  Lunch, sadly, was unremarkable.  We split the black bean chili stuffed sweet potato and while it was the best part of our meal, it was perplexing.  The \"chili\" looked more like straight black beans (as in we didn't see other normal chili components) but had decent chili flavor.  We both ordered the mac daddy and the patty tasted like the most generic patties one would find in a grocery store.  Definitely didn't taste like something made in house (not that the menu states that) but we've defintiely had much better tasting grocery store faux burgers.  Lastly, we split the chocolate thunder smoothie and while it has all the ingredients to make for an amazing explosion of taste, it just didn't satisfy any type of chocolate or pb craving.  I guess you could say it's smooth in flavor and that no single ingredient over powers the rest but who orders a  chocolate anything hoping for that??",

I tried some basic veggies and I was not liking them.  So let's talk about the service, I am not going to talk just about my server but in general, as I was ppl watching a little too much.  Form the hostess, to the 3 servers they were fabulous with the guest. I was not the only first-timer there, and they took their time to go over the menu w/ them.  From the first contact to when i was walking out everyone asked how I was doing.   I was talking to the people next to us when my date went to the bathroom, they were not local, and were Vegan. They told me the food was fablalous.",

Otherwise, It was so filling. My friend couldn't finish his chicken waffle. It came with spiced potato wedges, tomato sauce and syrup. The tea and the coffee were just mediocre. I loved their interiors. The place had abundant sunshine (that's what made my photos look amazing ! )  If your near the Fremont street experience in Vegas and you are very very hungry and definitely need to fill up your tummies, this is a to go spot!

Everyone is friendly, they work well as a team and they check on us several times. The atmosphere is casual but you get a 4 star service here.  The food was a pure disappointment.  We had the Bao bun with tofu and the sauce was too strong, as if it came out of a can but it was edible.  The steamed dumplings were soggy. Next were the entrees and the African yam stew was best of the bunch.  The Russian standard with pasta tasted like regular pasta with tomato sauce. But the Vegie burger with a bean patty was so bland, even if eaten by itself.  My husband took one bite and that was it, no second try.  We also had the non-dairy pizza, which looked good but tasted like paper.  Honestly, this is the worst pizza I have ever had in my life.  Not being a vegan, I needed at least some real cheese for flavor.   Our vegan aunt  also thought that the food was subpar.  So I am giving the food 2 stars.   We had other vegetarian food during our trip and the Veggies house was excellent, so were the veggie dishes at the Bacchanal.",

The fish tacos and sushi tasted very organic, and you'd never know that you weren't eating any animal-products.  If you just want to detoxify and eat truly healthy and amazing food, Vegenation is a great place to start. Digestion was easy because I wasn't eating an unhealthy meal - yet, I felt really full, because my nutritional needs were being met. The portions are generous and the prices were fair.  I had the organic blueberry cheesecake for dessert, and it was truly delicious.  I also recommend their pasta dishes.I can't think of any other 'restaurant' in Vegas that serves truly vegetarian options.  Daily Kitchen and Lyfe Kitchen are fine: they offer healthy options, but I feel great eating at Vegenation, because I know they're the real deal...This place is different and deserves their restaurant name.  Vegenation is very conveniently located Downtown and parking is super easy.  Great locale!",

Unfortunately our second meal was given to another table and about 10mins later the meal was taken from that table and given to me. They did offer to make me a fresh dish when I said I wasn't happy about eating food that had been in front of other people so long. Unfortunately this meant that my husband and I ate separately & no compensation for this was offered although the other table got to eat the free dish!  We were also told it was drinks happy hour \"buy one get one free\" but were charged for two beers. We were told this was because one person has to drink both beers. They reversed this charge when told only my husband had drunk the beers. Dessert was very disappointing. The chocolate tacos were recommended by the server and they were very tiny. More like three tiny wafer cakes. Would go back for the meatballs.",

Vegenation is amazing! We tried a bunch of different menu items (the sushi, the steamed dumplings, the Italian dumplings,the burger,  the curried kidney beans and quinoa, the chocolate tacos, and the mother of all brownie sundaes) and everything was absolutely delicious. In fact, the brownie sundae was hands down the BEST brownie sundae I have ever had in my life and I can honestly say, it will be hard for me to not come back regularly just for that. The service was incredible, the atmosphere is adorable, and the food is out of this world and made with love. Congrats to the entire Vegenation team on making your dream become a delicious and compassionate reality. I can't wait to try everything on the menu! HIGHLY recommend this place to any vegan, vegetarian, veg-curious individual, and anyone with taste buds and a love for food. You will not be disappointed.",

Downtown Las Vegas is lucky to have this restaurant and it deserves more than 5 stars. Would love to have your next location in Anthem.",

    "text": "I found this place while on vacation with friends and my husband. I was worried that, being that I was the only Vegan in my group, I wouldn't have any food options. But thankfully, yelp listed several options near the hotel we were staying in. First of all, this place is so quaint, located downtown in an area that is similar to \"Eat The Streets\". Parking was conveniently located in front of the restaurant. There was additional parking behind the building as well. The sign on the building made it easily visible and I loved the bright colors of the sign as well. Upon entering, the hostess was pleasant and immediately welcoming. The environment in general was so cute, warm, and bright with beautiful decor on the walls and tables. Loved the wooden type tables and the overall cleanliness of the dining area. The hostess offered a menu and quickly explained my options based on what I was craving. The menu was simple, back and front, thoughtfully separated into sections of breakfast, lunch, smoothies, dessert, etc. It also provided the ingredients in each meal or drink, which made it easy to choose from. I ordered the Super Food porridge with fresh fruit. That was AMAZING and very fulfilling. I actually couldn't eat all of it but I was able to save it for later. I also got the Chocolate Thunder which was a delicious smoothie and the Orange Burst. Both of these were fulfilling and was able to satisfy my sweet tooth for our long drive to Primm. But my most favorite were the Save the Tuna, Hot Tamale, and Black Bean Chili Stuffed Sweet Potato! I honestly couldn't believe how tasty these entrees were and all very good portion size. I got the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings. These were good but just a little too spicy for me. Prices are slightly higher than expected but worth every penny! I will definitely return next time I am in town. I have even gone as far as trying to recreate some of these because once I got back to Hawaii, I was craving every food option!",

I was really excited to try this place.  It is amazing as a vegetarian to be able to order anything off the menu.  However, I was disappointed with my east west tacos.  They were too sweet for my palate.  I did try my friend's muchas gracias quesadilla which was very good and my other friend's \"chicken\" pot pie was out of this world.  I'm scoring this place at 4 stars because the pot pie was so yummy.  They have a nice simple decor and the service was friendly.",

Nest we had the bao wow, these were almost as good as the ones we had in China.  I had the eggplant stacks as my entree, OMG, this was so good!! The sauce was tasty and the eggplant cooked nicely. My boyfriend ordered the pho-king delicious, he said it really was delicious. It looked good but my food was so good I didn't want to try his. I was full after eating all that but really wanted to try the tiramasu. It was ok, not something I would order again. But I'm not a coffee drinker and the cake was coffee soaked. With the exception of the desert, I would eat there again and probably order all of the same items. One of the best vegan meals I've had out yet!! Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The portions were generous for the price.",

I also have to have it gluten-free which makes it more restricted.  I think the best test of vegan cooking is, guess what, veggies!  I really do not enjoy eating  pretend food which cannot compete in the flavor department with the real thing.  So I ordered their sauteed vegetables for which I was charged extra for the tofu.  No big deal if the server mentioned it. I also ordered a serving of rice.  And  cheesecake with blueberries for dessert. Well, the veggies were overcooked and almost swimming in oil.  The rice portion was fine.  Cheesecake was just okay. I found the server aggressive in asking for the payment.  Card or do you need change?  When I gave her cash, again, do you need change?  Hey, why don't you just give me my change and I'll tip you accordingly!  I definitely will not be back. Food was not pleasing, service was pushy, and there must have been some gluten somewhere.  Was the oil guilty of wheat???  I broke out into hives soon after.",

Served in a small cake-like circle of deliciousness, with some of the best potatoes I've ever had, also served in a small cake form-factor. The service was friendly but not over-bearing and the entire meal, including coffee served in its own mini-press that you operate at the table, was 15 bucks. If it didn't seem too weird I would have come back and had the same dish for lunch and dinner, and again the next morning. There is only one other restaurant I'd actually travel to a city for, and it's Vedge in Philadelphia. VegeNation falls into that same category. Open one in Chicago!",

Their alcoholic drinks are not to be discounted, either.  The one we got for free for doing a Yelp! check in was SO good!  I can't remember what it was called, but it was apple flavored.

    "text": "My friend and I shared a FANTASTIC meal at VegeNation!  In Los Angeles, we are spoiled with the best vegan restaurants, and we were totally wowed by our meal here!  The \"Real Food Daily\" of Las Vegas.  Please expand to LA!  I would come here all the time.  Big portions, wide variety, delicious food- and prices are reasonable (unlike RFD).  I stumbled across VegeNation on Yelp, and loved how their website described them as passionate about preserving the environment, and creating delicious food for health.  Their chef, who worked in well-known NY restaurants, began experiencing health problems, went vegan, and decided to create a vegan restaurant with all his healthy creations.  (Interestingly enough, this is the same story of another vegan chef, Eric Lachesseur, the classically-trained French chef who opened Seed Kitchen in Venice).  Their menu and website looked really interesting and FUN, with funny named dishes, with some of the most popular items of different cuisines- tacos, bao, quesadilla, tagine, sushi, etc.  I told my friend about this place, and she said she already knew about it and had been wanting to come here- perfect!    The day we came, there was a chicken and waffle special!  It looked amazing and decadent, but we decided to pass on it.  The decor is casual and made pretty with plants, including a plant wall.  I ordered some coffee, even the coffee is local- the restaurant uses local ingredients as often as possible.  We started with the Bao Wow and the Save The Tuna sushi, the bao might be my favorite thing here!  I haven't had bao since going vegan, or vegetarian even, over 5 years ago.  What a treat!  For our meal, we ordered the Muchas Gracias sweet potato quesadilla, and the Ellen DeGeneres collard wraps.  The wraps were delish, but the quesadilla was the real star.    For dessert, we had the chocolate tacos, which were inventive, but my least favorite thing here.  It was all about the presentation, with a pastry outside in a taco shape holding chocolate pudding, with berries.  I didn't think the pastry was that great, and the salted caramel was too salty for me.  I think there was a brownie sundae on the menu that I would try next time instead.  VegeNation is such a gem, and I will make this a must-stop on all my future Vegas trips.  VegeNation would really do very well in LA, I think.  It's rare when you find the combination of delicious, healthy, local food in a wide variety, with fun decor, beautiful presentation, nice people, fun environment and specials (DJ's and live music sometimes!), reasonable prices, that takes measures to protect the environment.  What's not to like?!  Only the distance from where I live ;)  Bonus: there are some great outlets 5 minutes away in a cab- vegan food + shopping is a fun, mellow Vegas day in my book!",

Don't get me wrong I know that this is a new establishment and the bugs have to be worked out, but we sat there for over five mins before anyone even came to our table. No one even said \"hey I'll be right with you, I'm a little behind\" nothing. And they weren't even that busy. I had the grinder and it was ok. Kinda disappointed it came on a hot dog bun and not a nice hoggie roll. I also had a nice whisky cocktail so I will give points for that. But the server forgot my boyfriends beer and continuously forgot to check on us. Not sure if we will be back.",

    "text": "Went here to celebrate my birthday and had a really disappointing experience. Ordered two appetizers, the black bean hummus, just ok. The chilled jalapeno could of been pickled, grilled or served without the stem to make it tastier.The warm chips were nice though. The tamale, had to order some hot sauce to get my mouth salivating so I could swallow the saw dust like tamale dough. Not enough flavor stuffed into the tamale, just some lentils and topped with what tasted like canned green chilies. These were shared between my wife and I but had no app plates brought to us. I ordered the Tagine of harissa coated roasted vegetable and the first five bites were of potato that tasted like my wife's stale fried potato logs but cut into small pieces and sauced heavily. None of the other vegetables tasted roasted, the eggplant was chewy, zucchini tasted like it was blanched, and the sweet potato looked like it may have been oven roasted but come on!! Peel the skin off of the sweet potato! Elevate your cuisine and step it up. This isn't  hippie commune commissary food. This was served with quinoa which was swimming with all the vegetables in sauce. I sent this back and ordered the sweet potato ravioli, what a joke. Shouldn't have to use a knife in a pasta dish but the asparagus was too large, not bite size, the dish was served with way too much sauce, looked like a soup and the worst part is that the pasta was raw as in not cooked. I think the menu said or was told that it had pecans, I didn't taste any if so. For drinks my wife had the Pina Colada which was very good, I had a Riesling. My complaint on the wine is that it was served in a recycled wine bottle cut down into a  cup.  I appreciate using recycled this and that but good wine deserves wine glasses with stems. Nice to have a restaurant of this type (pure vegan) but I would rather go to a Mediterranean or Indian place that had vegan options, and a higher level of service standards.",

    "text": "Vegenation is an entirely vegan restaurant that specializes in making traditional meals in a vegan way and man have they aced it!. The restaurant is a lovely place for breakfast and lunch with an outside view of the street for people watching and that sort of thing. I have been here several times since it recently opened and let me just say best Mushroom pizza ever! Wow wow wow! ! I usually hate vegan cheese but their mushroom pizza was to die for. I also ordered  a berry smoothie,dumplings, the black bean hummus and Tamales.  Absolutely all favorites. I only didn't love the dumplings to much they tasted...healthy lol but everything else was perfect both times Ive been here and that may just be how I feel about dumplings in general. The portion sizes are fulfilling & I love the feel of this place, it has a coffee shop feel but with a cute twist. The decor is fresh and they have what seems like vegan pop art all over the place. The bathroom was very clean and the staff are all incredibly attentive and friendly. I do recommend parking two blocks away from Fremont and walking towards Vegenation and maybe taking a stroll through Fremont about two blocks away. Even if you aren't a vegan you need to check Vegenation out, This place is amazing!",

    "text": "I'm a little late with this review, it's been a few days. We went here because we had a vegetarian friend in our group and the menu looked good. Let's start with the staff, SUPER FRIENDLY and very accommodating , if we didn't like our food they'd replace it with something else and they always checked on us to make sure our drinks were full and we were happy. The food, AMAZING!!! We started off with Save The Tuna sushi, weirdly colored, but so delicious.  For our entrees we ordered several items and went buffet style and tried each other's food,LOL.  We had two different pizzas, one was the Picante Pineapple, it had pineapple, \"sausage\", and jalapenos, sweet and spicy but oh so good, the other was the Ciao Margarita, tomato and basil, YUM is all I can say and the crust for both pizzas was crunchy and perfect. We ordered the Downtown Tony, mushroom sliders, they were good, but in my opinion there was to much bun and the buns were a little dry. Next was the Vegenation Burger, HUGE, it was nicely seasoned and juicy full of flavor, fries were good but didn't care for the ketchup, it was tasty but to thick like they opened a can of tomato paste and gave you a scoop.  We had the Get Over The Hemp pasta, I don't know how to describe this, it was alright but not a favorite. Finally we ordered Little Soul, not to sweet raviolis in a delicious sauce. Desserts were interesting. We ordered 4 different items, vanilla ice cream, OMG is all can say, so smooth, creamy and vanilla flavored , we had the blueberry cheesecake some in the group didn't like the texture, I thought it was fine, the flavor was amazing. We went with carrot cake, um....not popular with the group at all, being made with oats, the texture was weird, flavor was ok. Finished with the Chocolate Tacos, I LOVED THEM!!! Some weren't fans, they said they were to salty. Three little bite size tacos made from cinnamon and sugar tortillas filled with creamy chocolate goodness and a salted Carmel sauce YUM!!!!  I licked my plate clean, LOL. Drinks? Now with this place being VEAGAN don't try ordering a coke, lol. I had a lemonade with coconut and chia seeds, not to tart and very refreshing , the Mango Ceylon iced tea was good, needed a little sweetener for me though same with the Jamaican Hibiscus Punch.   With everything being fresh and made to order the wait for the food was a little long but sooo worth it. Definitely coming back next time we're in town. Sorry there aren't pictures, the food didn't last long enough to take any, HAHA",

I recently watched a Morgan Spurlock documentary on the revitalization of downtown Las Vegas, so I hopped on a bus and made my way to a new restaurant featured on Happy Cow.  It was so good, I went back a second time.  Everything on the menu is plant based.  They even have Banksy art on the wall.  There is outdoor seating both in front and out back.  Service was excellent.  The jack fruit taco's were divine.  The sushi, out of this world.  Wonderful salads.  Great cocktails.  You need to visit it a few times because the menu is so extensive.  Be sure to check out the shipping container park around the corner.",

    "text": "This is a great restaurant whether you're vegan, vegetarian or simply trying to find delicious health conscious food, this is the place to eat in Las Vegas. In a town where food is abundant but vegan options are scarce VegeNation is an oasis of light in the darkness. The gluten free pasta was perfectly prepared. More like al dente wheat pasta than other grainy or mushy gluten free styles. The vodka sauce was creamy and perfectly flavorful. A balanced delicate richness is difficult to achieve with traditional ingredients when preparing vodka sauce so I tip my hat to this beautifully balanced vegan version. The pizza was much like any other vegan artisan style and had some less common, more health concious toppings to choose from. The sauce on the pizza was a bit plain. In my opinion it could use some more floral and savory flavors. Although slightly under salted the curried red beans and quinoa had a great flavor profile and the beans were prepared quite well, perfectly firm skin with soft creamy innards. I relished the flavor of the blueberry cheesecake and the crust had an amazing Graham cracker taste and feel which I love on my cheesecake. That said, the texture of the filling was a bit grainy which detracted from the presence of a perfectly sweet, cheesy/custard-like flavor. The service was decent. You could tell that everyone on the staff enjoyed working there which added to the cheery casual ambience of this cozy cafe. Definitely worth the short jaunt to the old Las Vegas strip for any VegeFriendly people living in or visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant, but I was disappointed.  Not the healthiest vegan restaurant.  I had the East West Taco, which wasn't good.  I didn't like the taste of the jack fruit and the bbq it was seasoned with (and neither did the people I was with that tried it).  My friend had the mushroom pizza, which was decent, but would've been much better if they used something other than Daiya cheese.  Daiya, in my opinion (and many others) is the bottom of the barrel.  There are so many other much better tasting vegan cheeses out there like Follow your Heart or Chao.  I don't see why any restaurant would use it other than because it's cheap.  My husband had the meatball parmesan sub, which was good, but these aren't homemade, they are outsourced.  The chicken that they use is not homemade either.  It's \"Gardein\" brand...which again, is bottom of the barrel and not a healthy option (soy protein isolate).  The waffles were really good, those seem to be made in-house.  The dessert that we all split was amazing.  It was a donut topped with icecream and it was delicious.  That was the best part of the lunch.   All in all, I think if they made more homemade quality food, this place would be awesome.  I'm from NJ and have tried many Vegan places, including By Chloe in NY, and this place just doesn't come close to the quality of food I've had at any of the places.  I come to Vegas every year and get amazing vegan food at the mainstream restaurants, so I probably won't be returning to this all Vegan restaurant (unfortunately).  I do hope that the restaurant reads my review and takes it constructively and makes some changes.  Homemade food is key.  If they use Gardein and outsource meatballs (one of the easiest and most delicious things to make vegan) I can only imagine what else is outsourced.",

To nail food, service, and decor this early is simply unheard of...but Vegenation has done it. My husband and I are not vegan, and although we often eat vegan, we usually feel like we are sacrificing a bit of flavor for the health benefits. Everything we ate at Vegenation was the right kind of filling and popped with so much flavor. Absolutely no sacrifice. Chef Donald is a master! My husband and I indulged on a variety of dishes - the Hot Tamales appetizer (Organic Masa, Pumpkin Green chilis and Lentils) - INSANELY FLAVORFUL, for entrees Muchos Gracias (Organic Sweet Potato Quesadilla Black Beans, Chipotle Crema) - just the right amount of spicy and super filling as well as the Vegenation Burger (didn't miss the meat at all), and for desert we had the Blueberry Cheesecake. How that cheesecake was dairy free is mystifying...it was just so so good. For drinks we had lemonade with coconut water and chia and an orange burst smoothie. Everyone at Vegenation made us feel welcome, we love the use of local ingredients and community collaborations (i.e., Boulder City's Frankly Good Organic Coffee, Grassroots Juice, etc.), and it's just too cool that they are actually growing their own plants on site. I don't think I've ever found a restaurant that so embodies my tastes and values, and I hope these guys enjoy all of the success they deserve.",

With amazing animal rights art on the walls, as well as a compete living wall and planters with vines cascading down, this place was generally a delight to be in. Besides the regular booth seating, there was a community table in which different party's of people got to sit together..It was different and pretty refreshing! The food was awesome too. Fiancee had pizza and I had a black bean quesadilla. Presentation was perfect and staff was friendly! The only complaint I have is that we had to wait about 30 minutes to get water. We got the food before we got water and that just irks me. It was busy, which was awesome, but it was 110 degrees outside and I was dying of thirst. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this place for any Las Vegan.",

Writing on the walls, really cool and awesome concept. Came out, and sat myself as I didn't see a sign or any direction. Sever Chelsy T came up to me and asked if I just walked in and sat myself, or if I waited and was seated. I told her I sat myself. Another sever also asked me the same thing, I explained it was my first time and I used the bathroom first. For whatever reason Chelsy T had an issue with me from the get go. Rude, and you could hear the irrigation and attitude in her voice. She didn't want to take my order, I could tell. I ordered the Ciao Margarita (amazing!!), the Orange Burst Smoothie, and the cheesecake (prefect! Not over sweet, the coconut and walnut combination is spot on). Food was great (I did take out, as Chelsy dimmed the atmosphere). I also left her a tip. When she brought my food I asked if there was a bag for the pizza, she immediately said no, and I seen bags hanging and asked for one of those. I don't know what the problem was, but it was not cool. Then a manager asked if there was anything else they could get me. I took it wrong having been irritated by Chelsy, and asked for a refund. She said she didn't know what was going on but heard Chelsy and said she would talk to her. I said thank you and took my food home to enjoy. The customer service to a first time customer in-house was terrible and the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars.",

My friend got the poke and the sliders and she thoroughly enjoyed it! The only thing was that they were out of a certain ingredient for a dessert we chose which was a little disappointing but if it wasn't for the rest of the experience and food this place rocked it!",

You usually end up with bad service or just slow service in general at vegan restaurants or not so corporate locations but this was a great experience. The food is phenomenal, in particular the pizzas were exceptional. Very satisfying, not overwhelming and not over priced. Great for parties and also reservations are accepted. Highly recommended",

    "text": "Vegenation had a promotion on Facebook where they would bestow a round of mimosas to someone who tagged friends they would like to have Sunday brunch with on their post.   My roommate and I tagged each other and three other mutual friends and we BOTH got chosen.   Two rounds of free drinks guarantees I will come to your restaurant, but it doesn't guarantee a good review. So, off we went, to try a vegan brunch. Only one of us is a vegan and my 8 year old daughter has a nut allergy, making vegan restaurants tricky.  We were sat quickly. Live music, exposed ventilation, greenery, reclaimed wood and great art makes for an amazing atmosphere. It felt hip and cultured and comfortable all at once.   In comes our server, Vanessa. Vanessa appeared to truly love her job, something few server exude. We put in our drink orders. The adults all ordered the adult beverages of our choice, as well as Peruvian French Press coffee, and my daughter ordered a berry smoothie. As Vanessa walked away, I realized I forgot to mention my kiddo's nut allergy. I called Vanessa back and asked that there be no almond milk in the smoothie. Vanessa handled it like a pro.   Food orders were put in later. The menu had a tiny illustrated peanut next to anything that had nuts in it. French toast was a no go for the kid. (My BFF ordered it, though, and I had a bite... heaven). Kid wanted mac'n'cheese, and they were out, but Vanessa handled it like a pro: \"Don't worry sweetie, it's not that good anyway\". We look at the menu again, and kiddo decides on the waffle, which has no tiny peanut with the description.   The food came out fast. It was all amazing. I was cutting the kiddo's waffle, pouring on the syrup, and Vanessa bursts out of the kitchen, and practically yells \"DON'T EAT THAT!\". It turned out the waffle was made with cashews. Vanessa took it away, brought out a side of fruit to occupy my daughter and brought back a \"cheese\" pizza, which my daughter loved... until she found a piece of a plastic bag in the soy cheese. Vanessa apologized profusely and took it off the bill. The chef came out and also apologized profusely.   But these things happen, it's not that big of a deal to me, and I told them that. I just wanted them to know because the next time it happens it might be to someone who doesn't know how a restaurant works. And let's face it....The burrito I had was wonderful. The guacamole was incredible. The French toast was to die for, as was the meatball sub and the sushi. Plus they gave us free drinks!   I was a server for a long time and I know Vegenation is new. I know \"New Restaurant Problems\" are a real thing. I am a bit miffed that their menu did not have a tiny peanut next to the waffle item, which is the only reason I'm not giving five stars.   The food and drinks, the atmosphere and the service were amazing. Seriously, if you want good service, ASK FOR VANESSA. And my carnivorous friends enjoyed their meals thoroughly. Since when does that ever happen at a vegan restaurant??",

We started off with vegan sushi- the red bean rice was delicious and complimented the sushi very well. I had the sliders while he had the meatball sandwich. The mushroom sliders were fantastic and so were the fries. My boyfriend LOVED the meatball sandwich- and complimented that it tasted so much like the real thing, he wouldn't be able to tell the difference. We finished off with chocolate tacos for dessert. They were divine! The only issue was that we wished they were bigger! Great experience, great atmosphere, and great food for carnivores and herbivores alike!",

The burrito was very bland and potatoes was the predominant ingredient.  The service was not the greatest... Our waitress was very snobbish and un present. We checked in on Yelp to get a free sangria, however she decided to not honor the check in offer, because she had already printed out the bill when we showed her the check in... In reality we had mentioned the offer when we ordered, but she \"didn't remember\". Either way, her attitude was not very vegan to say the least.",

Nothing really special which was a little disappointing because everything seems like it was going to have a nice twist. Loved that everything was vegan. Makes trying food interesting. Negatives were that service was pretty mediocre. I drink slot of water and it never got filled and I wasn't even given silverware which was a little strange. They were also out of a bunch of things on the menu. But, I can definitely cut some slack because I understand things are more selective here than a big restaurant etc. just not fun to not have any tea choices when they don't reply have many drink options to start with. I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the menu. The concept is worth supporting!",

The menu is pretty diverse and I even had pho! Being Vietnamese and vegan, I missed eating it. It comes pretty close to the real thing except it has the distinct taste of mushroom instead of beef or pork. Very healthy and wholesome food, so I can't complain. I believe I had a decent burger, smoothie, and buffalo cauliflower my first time around. And also a mimosa courtesy of one of the best waitresses I've ever encountered! She was very enthusiastic and informative. Her nickname was mama or something. Overall, I'd recommend 100%. Great for non-vegans and transitioning vegetarians/vegans too.",

    "text": "So, one of my colleagues is a pescatarian and was craving something fresh. We were visiting the Container Park and found this place on yelp. So we we're quite excited!   So I will say this post and rating is based on their service and not so much their food because we didn't really get to try any food.   So when we arrived, we were seated within 5-7 minutes, which was fairly quick. Once we were seated, our server arrived a few minutes later with water and ready to talk about today's special. A colleague and I took advantage of the Yelp special (free sangria), which was refreshing and I very much enjoyed. I will say it did take about 10 minutes to bring out two sangrias, a punch, and water. I understand that it may take a bit of time to put drinks together but it seemed to take a bit too long compared to other restaurants I have been too.   We were rarely checked in upon and we were not informed or communicated to about the delay of the food. Other individuals who had arrived before us acquired their appetizers after we did, after sitting for 40 minutes. We had to flag down other employees to request an update from our server. After our request, our server never came.   So after approximately 30-40 minutes of waiting for food to arrive, my colleagues decided they were no longer going to wait for the food because we weren't provided the service that a customer should be given.   In addition, when we were informing the hostess we were leaving and we would like to pay for the punch, then our server came out asking why we were leaving. Our server stated that the food needed 15-20mins to prepare; which surprised us because no one told us.   In the end, we appreciate the manager coming out and comping the drink but I wish they had given more attention to their customer service.   If I choose to try this place next time I'm in town, I hope they have made improvements.",

Vegenation is exactly what Las Vegas has need for what feels like an eternity. Not only is this restaurant 100% plant based, the Chef/owner is a classically trained professional Chef. This, my friends, is the real deal all the way.   The menu has a great variety of options ranging from sushi to tamales to pizza, and everything else in between. It's great if you're like me and cannot decide what cuisine sounds good at the moment (you can have them all!).   The food is great, does not have that typical \"vegan\" flavor (braggs, fake meat, etc.), and will satisfy even the most discerning of omnivores. I simply cannot recommend this wonderful gem enough.

He ordered an entree salad and seemed pleased. I had the eggplant stack, which was DELICIOUS. It consisted of two hefty, breaded eggplant slices with vegan ricotta in between them. It was covered with zesty tomato \"gravy.\"  We ordered the vegan cheese and fruit tray, which the server described as having three (3) types of vegan cheese: brie, feta, and one I cannot remember. When it was brought to the table, it only had brie, and the server said they were out of the other vegan cheeses. Ho-hum ... sure wish they would have said something sooner and given us the choice to change appetizers. This said, the brie was tangy and tasty. I would definitely go back to VegeNation!",

The girl who answered was being kind of sassy I chose to ignore it. Anyway when I arrived to pick up my food there was the rude hostess with the bad attitude and red short hair. Me and my friend were waiting for her to get our pizza and she just glared at us and looked very annoyed. It's not like we were being loud or anything you were simply just waiting. I'm assuming this was the same girl who took my call.  I was amused because I love coming here and everyone is usually very sweet.  I still kept my manners but she didn't even bother to say thank you or even greet me when I came in .  I didn't bother to tip her either for her shitty service. To top it off when I came home my pizza and cauliflower wing portions were so small . I couldn't believe I paid  $24 for this. When I dine in I usually get a much bigger portion. My friend and I usually split it but we were left so unsatisfied. I hope my next visit here won't be as bad as it was today.",

We waited almost 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged us further. I ordered the badass vegan burrito and biscuits and gravy to share as an appetizer. The burrito was fine. Small. No real complaints. The biscuits were very dry and had little gravy. My friend ordered some special which was chicken and waffles. Same thing. Expensive. Dry. Little sauce and the strangest-tasting ketchup ever for the nastiest undercooked wedge potatoes. All four of them. The service was slow and not-that-friendly. The place had this attitude that I'm repelled by in modern vegan-vegetarian restaurants where the owners and workers somehow think they're changing the world with their over-priced food and act like they've somehow scaled at least three Mt. Everests when they deliver their tiny, expensive portions.  For me, in Vegas, the search for a great vegan restaurant goes on. And on. And on.",

Answered all my questions about the menu.    I had the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings and Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi (see photos).  OMG.  Both were really really good.  I highly recommend each of these.    As for the 'Wings', I was somewhat dubious as to how this would taste, being a big chicken wing fan.  It did have the same texture you would expect in very good boneless wings.  The buffalo sauce used for this seemed spot on without being too spicy or too bland (for which I thought might happen).    The Gnocchi was amazing.  There is a lot going on in this bowl with tastes and textures.  A really nice comfort food.  My only wish/ suggestion would be that they add a side for a bread or roll type option to dip into the bowl.  I might have to stop in again before I leave town.",

I called the restaurant to make sure my request would be fulfilled (b/c we were super hungry) and she was super pleasant and helpful she mentioned not to worry and that our order would be taken care of.  We order Save The Tuna purple rice sushi roll which was so good , buffalo cauliflower that was amazing this pieces was pretty big it had a nice crunch and just the right amount of sauce. We also order the vegan burger and country cut style fries that was equally tasty. We also tried the jackfruit tacos that I wasn't a fan of but my husband was in love with the bbq favorited jackfruit. To each it's own.   Over all I enjoyed my experience and is so grateful that they took our order. This is a good place to go for vegan selections.",

    "text": "Had to delete my last 5/5 review... I came here last week on a Saturday. Of course it's going to be busy. (Understandable!) after waiting for 30 minutes in line to be seated, we agreed to sit at the community table because no one else wanted to and I'm more than fine with it. For 30 minutes, I sat with my friends wondering where our waitress was because our drink order hadn't been taken yet. We then noticed multiple other people who came in AFTER us were seated with their drinks... A little annoying and frustrating but we let it go. Finally our waitress came to our table and didn't apologize for completely ignoring us and serving everyone else beverages before us even though we got there before them. After taking our drink order, she came back and asked what we ordered because she forgot. The entire time we've been understanding that it was busy but at this point, I'm frustrated and annoyed because there's not very many people left in the restaurant. Finally, she comes back with our drink order and asks what we want to eat. We order. And we wait 45 MINUTES for 3 pasta dishes. Our waitress doesn't come ONCE to apologize for the wait or to notify us how our order is coming along. So in total we waited more than an hour and a half for our meal and drink when it was no longer busy and no one came to apologize or made us feel welcomed. I'm very sad because this was one of my favorite places but the service was really bad and that pretty much ruined it for me. It would've been nice if a manager came to the table and apologized but no one seemed too worried about us. I was completely astonished by everyone else being seated after us being served before us. Very dissatisfying and made us late to our event because it took so long.",

    "text": "OK. So the food is AMAZING! Let me just start off by saying that because the mission of this review is not to bash the restaurant.   I need the customers, owners and employees to realize how inappropriate DONALD was on the phone with me today.  My boyfriend and I are vegan/vegetarian. It's HARD to come to Vegas regularly for long days of strategic work and find healthy food to fuel our brains. This has been our FAVORITE place in LV. We even got to chat with the owners last month for a second to express our gratitude when they had the guest pop up chef from LA. Excitement grew as we learned they are on GrubHub although issues struck when I found that GrubHub would not deliver far enough in the span of a block. They will deliver to 4365 but not to 4500 on the street so I decided to call to see if something could work. I get a lovely lady named AARON (sorry if I misspelled your name lovely!) and she sent me to PostMates because they normally deliver as far as you want so I tried that but still no luck. I called back trying to see if I can figure something out. You all know that moment when your heart becomes set on having such delicious food. I ask for her because she was SUPER HELPFUL, KIND, and COMPASSIONATE ABOUT PROVIDING A GREAT EXPERIENCE. She said it was weird that they weren't showing up. So then she says \"Ok, try one more called EatStreet. If that doesn't work call back.\" At this moment, after the call, I turn to my boyfriend and go \"OMG I love the vegan/vegetarian culture because people are so genuinely nice and they want to help you! They know how important it is to eat well.\" My heart filled with love just because of her kindness I get back on my computer and try EatStreet. Unfortunately, EatStreet also said delivery unavailable. Now keep in mind I had just put down 50 MINUTES OF MY TIME to figure out how to order this food. I even offered to pay more to get it. We also discussed having GrubHub drop it off at the strip club down the street.   So I call back and ask for Aaron again and the host said hold on...  \"Hello this is DONALD,\" an agitated, grumpy voice came on the phone. I try to tell him my situation but I can barely get through it by the time his negative energy cuts me off and says \"We are in downtown and only deliver so far.\" I told him I understand that but I was working with Aaron to see if we couldn't figure something out. I told him she directed me to EatStreet but if I still had problems call back. No joke he says \"Try EatStreet.\" I repeat myself. I'm a little frustrated with his attitude but my voice was still calm and nice trying to work with him. Again he was soggy and said \"The Orleans is too far, the delivery companies only go a certain radius.\"  I was also literally OK with jumping in a taxi and meeting GrubHub down the street. Aaron may not have even been able to condone that but she was sincerely trying to help and her help wasn't taking her off the floor for more than a minute each time I called. (Now I have also worked at many restaurants from serving to bartending in downtown San Francisco and San Diego. I know a minute does effect flow but there are lovely other options on how to deal with inquisitive customers like myself.)  I could feel his negative energy through the phone and I choose not to deal with toxic energy. I ask for Aaron because she knows what's up. DONALD replies to me as if I'm one of his employees (obviously the manager) trying to distract him from a rush, \"Aaron can't come to the phone, she's on the floor right now. It's lunch time. It's busy!\" In my head I'm like, duh, why else would I be trying to order food from you... It's close to lunch. I told him he was providing poor customer service and he hung up on me....HE HUNG UP ON ME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!! No \"Could you please try calling back later?\", no \"I'm sorry miss I don't know what else we can do for you.\", No suggestions to another restaurant or hey even try another vegetarian search around your area with the GPS on. There were SO many other ways he could have dealt with this situation. DONALD WAS NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT KIND. I wouldn't have been mad or anything if he or Aaron couldn't help me as long as they were kind about it!   Needless to say when we go to VegeNation this week I hope Aaron is working so I can express how much gratitude I have for people like her. I hope she knows her light shines through his darkness. I hope all the employees can block out the negativity as well. I know what it's like to have a blood-sucking boss. I hope eventually the owners of VegeNation will take a step toward bettering their workplace environment by finding a replacement for DONALD. He needs to work at a restaurant that supports his negative attitude rather than working at a restaurant in which part of their values are to \"Do good by people.\"   P.S. Congrats Donald..This is the most time I've ever spent writing a review!  Eek! Methinks not about Donald!!",

The trouble:   The service is friendly but  slow and the food lacks flavour. The out of Africa dish is supposed to be spicy. It is not spicy at all.  The buns used for the downtown tony and vegeNation burger taste like they are 15 days old. Dry and hard. Salad is meh.   I always get a bit anxious when it comes to ordering food fearing that I keep making the wrong choices but, I've tried a handful of dishes and I can't say I liked even one of them. :(  Please please fix what's going on in there.

Not very cold. Confused on the taste.   The food (Sushi, Pasta, Buns, Quesadilla, Burger, Fries, Tacos) hit the spot! They are a bit over priced for what they are- (I could make it at home). The presentation of the food is beautiful, but for \"street food\" I think maybe some alterations to fit that aspect could be made.   The Dessert (Sundaes) The ice cream that they use is awesome!! So creamy and flavorful. It was a huge portion and I think fit the price!   The Service was on point. The hostess was so humble and kind. Our waiter was good and attentive. I saw chef Donald come out to talk to some of the customers.   I am totally going back to try the other foods. All in all it's a cool place..

The flavors rocked and could stand up to any strip restaurant at a fraction of the price.   Tip on parking: If you park in a lot after 6pm it is an automatic $10. Before 6 it is $2 an hour right behind Vegenation (other lots can charge higher because they are private owners). Park on the street for $2 an hour and, don't worry about running to the meter because you're running out of time, there's an app for that.   Show your support for this restaurant because it is really great. Oh yeah, it's across the street from container park.",

I love that they rotate their menu to incorporate flavors from different seasons! Oh and the prices are a bargain for the quality of these dishes.  2. THE AMBIENCE: They nailed the vibe in this restaurant. The staff are helpful and positive, the decorum is upbeat (love all the unique artwork), and the lighting is just right.  3. THE FLAVOR: Most important of all, the food is delicious. This all-vegan restaurant packs a flavorful punch without compromising on health. I had the Torre Washington (a quinoa salad named after the vegan bodybuilder), Baked Alaska, and Cauliflower Wings, which were all delicious!",

Right on Carson street with an adorable street side patio area where you can people watch and nosh on some great vegan delights.   I'm not a vegan myself,  but my dining companion was,  and he highly recommended this restaurant... And I can see why.  As a non vegan,  I found the food to be filling and fabulous. Our server Faith was really friendly and helpful explaining that even when things on the menu said \"creamy\" or \"chicken\" that everything was 100% vegan.    We had the save the tuna,  tuna-less roll,  the bao wow,  and the chicken pot pie.  That tuna roll tho! So innovative and delicious.  I I wouldn't order that as a tuna replacement, but more as just something that I loved at any sushi restaurant. The chicken pot pie was in fact creamy and delicious. There were little gnocchi dumplings in it.   All in all,  I'm sure I'll be back as it is open later in the evening, and provides a nice place to eat for a healthy lifestyle.",

Some dishes I am wild about and others not so much. That's just the way it goes, right? This time around I had their  \"My Little Dumplings\" and the tamales. I loved the dumplings! This is one dish that is hard to find without meat elsewhere, so of course I had to order them. Filled with shiitake mushrooms and spinach, and covered with a yummy dipping sauce, these bites were a perfect starter.   Tamales are also a go-to for me, when I can find them veggie. These were HUGE. I could only finish one, but if I had more room I would have kept going. They were filled with a super tasty green sauce, that I was nervous about being spicy, but it wasn't and balanced well with the tamale.   Yum! Coming back, for sure.",

I'd give them a 5 star rating but we ran into an issue.   My friend left her card in the checkout book and we called to ask if it was there. Whoever she talked to wasn't very helpful. It seemed like the host or whoever answered the phone didn't take the time to ask everyone about it, and said they didn't have it. We were sure it was there, so we walked back and the hostess tells us all the servers have already left. But a server in the back (our actual server, was still there!) over heard and said they had it, and the manager went to get it.   It sucks because if she would have taken the time to communicate with everyone working, my friend wouldn't have freaked out and cancelled her card asap. Now she is stuck in Vegas and can't access any of her money.   It's a pretty small restaurant, so it shouldn't be hard to ask everyone working about something so important, just a suggestion to the staff.",

We shared shiitake & spinach dumplings for a starter, then the portobello sliders and the panko breaded chicken sandwich.  Every morsel was beyond delicious.  The crispiness of the chicken, the savory umame of the portobellos,  even the housemade curry ketchup for dipping fries-- I'll be remembering and craving those for a long time.  We happened to be staying downtown so this was a short walk for us, but we will be back on our next trip to town even if we're down at Trop corner.  The vibe is super friendly, and there's clearly a big and enthusiastic local following, with a steady stream of people picking up to-go orders.",

We rushed to the restaurant and was greeted by a friendly face who immediately seated us. We had trouble choosing what we wanted since everything on the menu sounded pretty good. We ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower wings (a little too spicy for me), bao wow, muchas gracias, pho-king delicious, and east west taco. Everything was prepared beautifully and tasted sooo delicious. We were definitely satisfied and glad that we came. That being said, VegeNation is a place where you'd want to bring not only your vegan friends but your non-vegan friends as well because the food is just amazingly good they wont believe it's all 100% plant-based!",

Took the drive out there and was greeted by a really friendly woman named Kelly. Amazingly friendly and out going. Asked her what was good and all she could say was everything. Lol. And too our surprise she wasn't joking. Everything we ordered was absolutely amazing. We had a bunch of appetizers starting from their signature Buffalo Wild Wings cauliflower florets, then their home made dumplings and their sushi. Then to top it off they had an amazing macaroni pizza. Caitlyn was our waitress and she was super knowledgeable and such a sweet heart. We had such a great time and customer service experience we will definitely be back to eat there throughout our trip.   Thank you Kelly, Caitlyn and all the staff.... you guys were amazing. Your new vegan friends. Aloha.",

    "text": "Update: I've come back to update my prior review. Once again I've ordered the \"My Little Dumplings\". The speed at which they were brought to the table was very quick and the taste and quality were excellent - I definitely recommend. The main course was the \"Mushroom Madness Pizza\" which I ordered because I wanted to try their vegan cheese options. I'm happy to say the pizza crust is very close to the consistency and taste of a non-vegan crust. The cheese is a little sticky, but I think that can be ignored as it is a non-dairy option. I would like to see the owners maybe keep salt and pepper shakers or hot sauce at each table in case patrons want to spice their meals up. I've updated my score from 3 stars to 4.  Tried the My Little Dumplings which comes with a sauce with a nice spice. My main course was the Daniel Negreanu meatball grinder. I don't know what it is, maybe the vegan cheese, but their chesse never seems fully melted, and the food gets cold very quickly. The bun itself was very hard on one side and soggy from moisture on the other. The meatballs are good and taste like real meat. This place isn't terrible, and the prices are fair, but if you're looking for a good vegetarian restaurant, I'd recommend Veggie House near Chinatown.",

I highly recommend the Bao Wow, it was so incredibly delicious. My biggest complaint is that there were only two on my plate!   I left thinking about it all night, this is now one of my favorite restaurants in town.  Get in here and try their food ( just skip the pot pie)",

The restaurant itself is simple, and clean.   Food was excellent! This is a great addition to the tiny vegan community in Las Vegas. The quesadillas (very spicy!) and bao buns were delicious. Bao buns are hard to do. The entree portions are quite large, I almost couldn't finish.   Only bad part? I really wanted to order the worms & dirt dessert off of the kids menu but was too embarrassed to ask if it would be alright...  The table next to us ordered one of the pizzas, and it looked amazing, I will definitely be trying that next time. This is absolutely a place I'll come back to. I think even non-vegans will be hard pressed to find something to complain about.",

There are live plants throughout the restaurant that make the dining that much more enjoyable. The community table particularly is lined with plants above that ground you in the feeling of nature. Even if you dont know anyone around you while sitting at the comunity table, you will feel like a part of a family as you meet the many uniqe people who frequent VegeNation.  The food is incredible. The texture of the \"chicken\" is fantastic and the flavors of the food are extremely impressive. The drinks are also amazing. From the smoothies, to the lemonade, to the craft beer and couragous cocktails. There is definitely something to be said about a Vegan Restaurant that serves alcohol. A definite must go.

It was way more sweet potato, garbanzo beans, and quinoa however, the flavor was on.point. Was I annoyed that there wasn't more okra? Yeah of course, but still delicious. My husband ordered the black bean burger, and again flavor on point, HOWEVER it fell apart faster than Kim K's marriage to Chris humphries.  We also had the wannabe Tuna sushi roll and I can honestly say it filled my craving for sushi. Lastly, the brownie Sunday to finish it all up. Was delicious but brownie was too small.   All in all, I'll definitely be back because there's so many things I still want to try.",

It was fresh, but it was literally a bowl of greens with a red pepper, a few slices of cukes and a radish; no cracker, no grain, no nuts. Powerhouse? I guess i don't quite get it. It was at least... fresh? Problem is I told the waitress when she asked how it was. She never offered me a cracker or the menu to order one. We also had the dumplings. They were good too; yet five to share doesn't fill one up at all. My advise: Read the menu and ask questions like: what does it has in it. BTW My tacos I made at home filled me up. Just frustrated that I had to cook and wash dishes.",

    "text": "Went on Saturday 1-30-16 around 7PM.  This restaurant is located on Carson between Glutton & Zydeco. The ambiance is hip yet casual and the waitresses look like typical hipster vegans with their multi-colored hair and septum piercings.  I quite like their living plant wall and plants hanging over the tables.   .  $42.62 got us some spaghetti and meatballs for the boy, an orange smoothie, a greek salad, a dumpling appetizer, and a quesadilla.   . $6.00 Orange burst smoothie- Consists of orange, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and pineapple. It is served in a cute mason jar which is appropriate because it tastes just like a scented candle.   . Sadly they were all out of the \"save the tuna\" vegan sushi so we had to settle for the My Little Dumpling appetizer for $6.95. The steamed shiitake & spinach dumplings were served in an adorable bamboo steamer basket.  I very much enjoyed these.  They are served with chopsticks and a tasty soy-based dipping sauce.  . $10.95 Muchas Gracias- Organic sweet potato quesadilla with black beans and chipotle crema.  Husband quite enjoyed this.  It was served very hot and fresh.   . $10.95 Greek salad- Has feta, kale, romaine, red peppers, green peppers, onions, vinagrette, olives, and oddly enough- tortilla chips.  I found the tortilla chips to be out of place in a greek salad but I enjoyed the vegan feta cheese more than I thought I would.   . $7.00 Chocolate tacos- Delicate crunchy pastry shell with chocolate goop, chopped strawberries, coconut, more mystery goop on top, and HUGE PIECES OF ROCK SALT...like the kind you use to make ice cream! I liked everything but the ginormous hunks of salt, which, according to our waitress and the chef, are supposed to be in there.  I sincerely hope nobody loses a tooth eating one of these.  The waitress was nice enough to take it off our bill.   . That's alright because I didn't have \"mushroom\" in my tummy for dessert anyways.  I should also mention that they wanted us to wait 20 minutes and we had to ask if they'd 'lettuce' sit on the terrace.  They did not 'carrot' all that we had no utensils or napkins the entire time we were there.  Overall I'm glad to have 'bean' there but 'olive' myself and my wallet too much to go back.  Peas!",

It's a medium sized facility and we had no trouble finding street parking. (We DID have to pay the meter). Waitress was attentive though after ordering the tamales as an appetizer she came back very cheery to ask how they were to which I replied with a sad face \"not good\", her smile dropped instantly and I felt bad for telling the truth. On the upside, my husband and I \"checked in\" receiving 2 free sangrias which we were happy about cause they are very pricey on the menu. On the downside, they tasted mediocre at best. I didn't even finish mine and I'm still curious as to why they are so expensive when they tasted the way they did. On the upside, the \"meatball\" sub and the \"chicken\" pot pie saved the meal and were worth the money. We ordered a cheesecake as well which was edible however keep in mind the crust is overwhelming nutty and nut flavored. It didn't phase me much but my husband passed on it after the first bite. Anyway, there's my roller coaster ride of a review on this one.",

The place is located in Downtown so parking can be tricky, we were lucky and got there when it wasn't crazy busy so got Parking at the next street and walked right over.   We were seated and greeted immediately. I tried their lemonade with coconut water... I like it. Something different and definitely more healthy. Their hibiscus tea is also very good, very strong in flavors. The mango tea was very bland.. Could not taste the mango at all! We started out with Save the Tuna and My Little Dumplings, both were very good. Save the Tuna tasted like eating sushi... But even healthier. The sauce that came with My Little Dumplings was so delicious... I drowned my dumplings in that sauce... Tasted like soy sauce but sweeter .. Must try!   I got the Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi... But was ok. The sauce tasted like some kind of sweet potato puree ... Good but not my favorite. The spaghetti that my friend got was pretty good... The texture of the meatballs was just like meatballs ... But you can smell and taste the mushroom that they used. My other friend got the portobello sliders and really liked it.   Overall a really nice experience, good service and good food. Definitely better than expected and will definitely come again.",

It started off with the hostess literally taking 15 minutes to even take my name down. The hostess apparently takes to go orders and so that took precedence before she would even acknowledge me.  That was annoying. When we finally got seated I was so exited about our meal tho. We ordered the buffalo wings bc the last time I was here they were so good. Not this time. The sauce was good but the cauliflower was super burned that it tasted rancid. I ordered the gnocchi pot pie and it was disgusting. My friend did too and she sent it back is was so inedible. My husband got the pho which was bland AF and then he proceeded to get food poisoning the next morning. We will never go back. I'm sad because I loved my first experience here but never again will I step into this basic b, terrible place again. Our waitress also couldn't give a F about serving us btw.",

From my brief moment inside, the decor and the place seemed pretty nice.   I had a sweet potato and black bean quesadilla and their tamale. I was blown away by how good the quesadilla was and asked myself who thought of this masterpiece? The tamale was okay, probably would have been much better had I ate it in fresh out of the pot at the restaurant.   My wife had the dumplings and she loved them. They too, however, would have been even better had we eaten them there.   My advice, give it a shot if you're a vegan and want a variety of foods. But most importantly, if you really want to enjoy, EAT IT THERE! Do not expect greatness trying to eat it at your hotel lol",

Within a few minutes their drinks were brought upon them and the waiter took their orders. We sat there in awe as the guy who sat us kept helping other may tables (with white people), while my family and I kept waiting. I became enraged, as the wAiter kept avoiding our table but could do little favors for the family next to me. After waiting there for 30 minutes we decided to leave.

The food is amazing and the service and staff are even better. Everyone is friendly and clearly loves working for such a health conscience and environmentally sustainable business. Best vegan food I've ever found in vegas. The prices are suprisingly low for how much food you get, and for how delicious it all is. I will not rest until I have tried every menu item!! Friends not food!",

I came back with my wife a couple times and have been trying as many things on the menu as we can. So far the appetizers are great ( sushi, dumplings, & tamale), the pasta is great! My wife loved the mushroom sliders. Pizza is okay (I don't really care for daiya cheese and prefer veggies with no sauce) but it was a good sized pizza. And desserts were small but delicious. Oh and the servers have all been wonderful as well. They are always happy and helpful in helping pick something. I will probably eat here weekly.",

    "text": "O how I love this place.  I've been vegan for about 6 months now, and was really excited when I saw this place was about to open.  Me and the GF have eaten here atleast once a week every week, and I think we have had everything except the desserts and one of the tacos.  I'm going to start with a general overview, and later in this review break down some specific dishes that I love, and some that I'm not such a huge fan of.  When you first walk in you are greeted by an always smiling face.  Most of the time it's a very nice gal, I think her name is Erin.  She is always willing to work with us on seating because I don't like sitting with my back to people.  The art is mostly vegan inspired, and it was great to see some local art, especially the stuff from recycled propiganda.  I love their stuff and have several of their pieces in my collection.  A wall covered in vines spills out as a reminder of how beautiful plan based foods are, proudly displaying their logo in the middle.  When thus place first opened the wait staff was a little sketchy.  I understand new reasurant, and all, this however doesn't excuse the rookie mistakes from the wait staff.  Waiting 10 minutes of drinks, and forgotten waters was common, and lack of menue knowlage was also rather common.  I think the chef may have resolved this now, but most of the time we just ask for Art to serve us if he is working.  He is truly a master of the craft attentive, but not invasive.  Funny, but not over bearing.  I have tried to phone in Togo orders on gallery nights when we were trolling around 18b, with mixed results.  Sometimes the phone just rings and rings, other times a smiling voice greats you.  The food is 100 percent plant based, with some gluten free options.  Save the Tuna- A vegan take on sushi that is a must try if your a first timer.  Chef nailed it on this dish.  Perfectly balanced and portioned.  I say try it with out the soy sauce first, than just a quick dip if you still think it needs it.  The forbidden rice adds color and incredable flavor that contrasts the veg caviar it is topped with.  It sells out every night, so get in early if you want this.  Steamed mushroom dumplings - vegan pot stickers.  I hear these recently went under a change, they were okay, nothing to write home about.  Texture was nice with the mushrooms adding a nutty flavor.  I haven't tried the updated version, but the presentation in a bambo steam basket was the best part of these.  Go with the save the tuna.  Bow wow- WTF is this?  It was good, but not great the steamed puff that these...  almost taco on a cream puff things came out on looks great, taste and texture...  not so much.  Steer clear of these weird kind of soggy and sweet things.  Mexican Hummus- hummus with black beans and blue tortia chips.  Umm... winning...  I've been trying to recreate this at home, and been failing miserably for weeks.  Chef don has really done fusion right here.  Tangy and both hummus and black beans at the same time make this a winner.  I have ordered this 5 times now and one time got a weird batch.  A meal can be made with just this and the save the tuna if you only want some lighter fair.  Pizzas- using daiya cheese is hard.  To much and it's a gooey mess, to little and it lacks flavor.  We have done a half tomato basil and half mushroom pie here a few times and it can be absolutely incredable, or a soggy mess.  Most of the time it's a 10, one time we got soggy mess.  Don't let that stop you from trying this.  Super thin crust is great, and just how I like my pie.  Sweet potato black bean quesadilla- I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatos, but saw this on a neibohor's table and decided to try it.  I was hoping for more black beans and less sweet potato (personal preferance).  Texture was great and it was topped with a cashew queso that is a staple in my house. If you like sweet taters, this will be a great dish for you.  Meatball grinder - This is my go to. I love this sandwich more than anything.  It's a normal style hoggie bread, with Gardaen Meatballs and marinara topped off with some dayia motz.  Side of fries and home made ketchup round out this plate.  If your a meat eater (I'll lecture you later) and your friends drag you here...  the gradaen meatless meat balls and better than the real thing.  Stick with this and than later we can watch some Gary Yorofski videos to make you go veg too.  Mama Mia - Pasta with marinara was good, a touch watery as most reasurant marinara is for some odd reason but delicious to the end, and topped with some of the awesome Gardean meatballs.  (Wish I had some nutritional yeast to top this off like parm.  Actually maybe every table should have a Nutch shaker...)  Smoothies are a little soy milk heavy, I think it's to ease the blending and get them done faster.  Very smooth and delicious.  Rookie waiter said it was a vitamix in back, than I saw a blendtec pitcher one day...  not sure which they use but both are too end blenders. To long",

They have a clever, but compact, vegan menu with options that could easily fool any carnivore. We all ordered something different and made sure to pass our plates around so we could each get a bite. I'm talkin' Bao Wow, East West Tacos, Ciao Margarita pizza, My Little Dumplings, the Daniel Negreanu grinder, sushi, etc... In other words: almost the entire menu. And each dish was pretty tasty in its own way! My only complaint is that a couple of the items (the pizza and the meatball grinder, to be exact) got cold & soggy quite fast. It was kinda hard to even pick up the slices of pizza because the thin crust was not crispy whatsoever...  NOTE: The free sangria you get for checking in is yummy!",

Menu has a lot of variety, may be hard to choose what you want: apps, salads, pizzas, and various ethnic entrees, plus juices.   MY LITTLE DUMPLING: steamed Shiitake and spinach dumplings. Easily some of the best dumplings I've had, stunningly good quality. They were clearly fresh and handmade, with ample filling, and a tasty dipping sauce to boot. But $6 for a portion of 5 just-bigger-than-bite-size bits was steep. DOWNTOWN TONY: Trio of portabella sliders with kale and sriracha aioli. Pretty good execution, good choice of mini brioche buns, but the aioli was so sparingly applied it seemed to be on there for color rather than flavor. Dish is plated with some simple potato fries and a house-made ketchup. Again, good quality!  Dishes are flavorful but sophisticated, with a  price tag to match. Solo lunch above was a hair below $20 with tip. Service was polite and attentive, really love the way they've styled the space! I'll come back to try their vegan sushi and bao.  EDIT: Dropping a star. As happy as I am to have vegan options in Vegas, this place is inconsistent. Most recent visit was sorely lacking in both food quality (boring, simple dishes) and service (inattentive, lack of knowledge when we had questions about specific dishes).",

    "text": "The world NEEDS more places like VegeNation!!!  Everyone at VegeNation was so accommodating to people in our party's strict dietary needs & allergies, and their menu was packed full of nutrients & plant-based awesomeness! My husband, has been following their account on Instagram (@vegenation) for quite awhile and he was dyyyying to go once we got back here in Vegas. Needless to say, he was definitely pleasantly surprised at the level of excellence! We definitely want everyone know of their awesomeness... seriously the good word of this place's wonders needs to be spread everywhere!    We wish there were more restaurants on board with what this place stands for, we need more people to be #Vegucated (watch this life-changing documentary on Netflix to understand why I say this) to be filling & fueling their bodies with a nutrient dense plant-based lifestyle!   Heal & nourish your deficiencies with plants! (Sidebar: Yes! You absolutely can get enough protein on a plant-based lifestyle, there are body builders & weight lifters who do it everyday and are champions)  As you can see from my pictures, we got the \"Downtown Tony\" - Portobello mushroom sliders with a slaw tucked inside of a multi-grain/whole wheat type bun, and a side of 4 oven-baked fries with minimal seasoning, and with with a side of sriacha aoli (but you can also request a chipotle aoli if you so desire). My husband got the East West Tacos with the jackfruit ( mock-BBQ pulled pork ) & a side of the oven baked fries. Tasty!! Our friend is on a very specific elimination diet to help weed out what's causing him some discomfort, and he was generously accommodated with a smile!  He got a bowl of brown rice and steamed (or possible sauteed in olive oil, can't remember) vegetables, but only the certain vegetables that he could currently consume, and a side of plain oven baked fries. He was worried it would be too much trouble for them due to his strict limitations, but they graciously assured him it would be no problem at all, putting him at ease, and filling his tummy with warm food, a much needed change up from dried hotel food and rice cakes.  We also shared the Mexican Hummus which was SUCH A refreshing change from just the standard hummus w/ chickpeas... the blackbean hummus was rockin'! We definitely are a fan!!  We finished off with the decadently fabulous fresh blueberry cheezcake dessert  (I spell it quirky like that because it's obviously not real cheese, as everything is vegan here) which was fantastic! We have a very similar dessert back in Florida at a raw/vegan place and it was just as good as our favorite place! Hubbs got the orange, ginger & tumeric smoothie to go as well.  VegeNation, thanks for an awesome culinary experience!  Thanks for existing, you rock! Our bodies & taste buds were happy, and tummies not sad and weighed down!",

The manager did not come talk to us and they sat us separately. Our group was able to accommodate ourselves together at a larger community table after other customers left. They still wanted to charge us for a group gratuity and did nothing to make us feel welcomed or comfortable. We spoke to the manager upon request and she was not professional in any way. She did not seem concerned about pleasing her customers and tried to validate their faults with us choosing no gratuity versus getting appetizers and drinks on the house and didn't not confirm which one we would get. Very disappointed on the entire vibe of the staff for such a wholistic establishment.",

We waited for a seat for about 15 minutes which is fine. After being seated it took us about 10 minutes to get just water for the table and we had to ask the bus boy to help us. Evidently our waiter had a large party (as that's what we were given as an explanation as to why they took so long to simply take our drink order). Not to be rude but the large party he was servicing was not our fault. I would've rather waited to be seated than sit there at our table with no service.  All in all the food was amazing and the experience a  positive one. Maybe just their timing could be a bit better?  Or maybe it was just an off night. But that is the reason for the loss of a star.",

I have not been able to visit them for an event, but I have taken my fiance here for a couple date nights. I have a dairy allergy, so the fact that EVERYTHING is vegan is amazing! The pot pie is one of my favorites, and their lemonades are so fresh and delicious. Yes, it is a little pricey, but the quality of the food and the fact that it's vegan makes it worth it.   The only thing is I don't really feel like they advertise they're vegan. The first time we went we didn't see any signs in the restaurant or the menu that said it was vegan so we just assumed it was vegetarian (we saw that they had meat on the menu so we figured it was Gardein or something like that.) Our waitress didn't even mention it, so I can't tell if it's a business choice or if most patrons know it's vegan. Either way, this little place is fantastic and you should definitely stop by and enjoy a meal here!",

I've been vegan for about 4 months now so I decided to search Yelp for an interesting, healthy, and delicious vegan spot for our meal. I found Vegenation and was lured in by the gorgeous pictures of pink sushi and a bright green living wall. Unfortunately, although a cute and casual environment, this excursion was horrible.   I won't bore you anymore with all of the lengthy details so here is a summary of our disappointing night-  CONS-  *weird and uninviting smell *THE WORST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant...waitress was awkward and distant, never cleared our menus or plates, and brought our appetizers and dinner all at the same time *AVERAGE main courses- something you could buy from the frozen section (soggy bread and watery pasta sauce)   PROS *pretty setting *delicious appetizers (dumplings & tamales) *nice white wine  OVERALL don't come here & waste money on mediocre food and services  I feel like this place could have been so much nicer with higher quality food and better service!",

    "text": "I just visited for my third time. I keep hoping that the food and service will get better with time but it hasn't happened.  SERVICE: It seems like the servers, hostess and busboys have never worked in a restaurant before. Everyone is very awkward and unprofessional. The other thing I have noticed with each visit is that some tables get good service while others (like my table) get lackluster service. It seems like the servers favor regular customers or friends and neglect you if you aren't in those categories. I have had to ask for refills on drinks every time without them being attentive because they are too busy chatting with the chosen ones.  FOOD: I have tried the portabella sliders, sushi roll, the spaghetti with meatballs and the meatball grinder. While OK, everything is lacking flavor and pizazz.  Take the meatball grinder...It is a roll with 5 small meatballs (taste just like gardein meatless meatballs...maybe they are?) with some sauce and vegan cheese. It is very basic and the taste is lacking. Some grilled onions and peppers would go a long way to make this basic sandwich better. The roll is not sturdy enough to handle the runny sauce and gets soggy within minutes. The spaghetti is the same story...basic spaghetti with sauce and the meatballs. Again, some onions and peppers...something besides the basic sauce would be good. The portabella sliders are OK but the rolls they come on were stale tasting. The sushi is good but again is just plain bland. Some spices and seasonings would go a long way to make this place better.  PRICES: Most dishes are in the $11-$12 range. The meatball grinder is not worth anywhere near the $11 they want for it and the $11 spaghetti dish is a very small portion size and again not worth the $11.   With few totally vegan restaurants in town, I was excited to try Vegenation initially. My experiences have been lackluster however.  It just seems like A) the staff id very inexperienced and caters to regulars; B) the food is lacking substance and could be jazzed up and C) the prices are out of line for what they are serving up.",

After reading some reviews, I choose the Save the Tuna roll, Mexican Hummus, and the Pho king Delicious.  The Save the Tuna roll was fresh, but bland. I expected more flavor from using fresh food, but it just tastes like rice. The purple forbidden rice was aesthetically pleasing and made me want to eat it, despite the fact it was bland.  The Mexican Hummus was served with blue corn chips, however, I personally felt the Hummus was bland even with the salt in the chips I get like it needed more lime or spice or salt....something.  The WINNER of the meal was the Pho King Delicious! The flavors were married together, they leave the lime in when you order it to go, don't know if that is how they always do it, but it gave it additional flavor that was delicious. You could taste the mushrooms on the broth, I could order that every day! If you like Pho, this dish is the way to go! Probably the best Pho I've ever eaten, and it saved the review on the food!",

One word to sum it all: fantastic! The quesadilla with sweet potato and black bean filler was the best I've ever had. The Vegenation burger was delicious and filling and satisfied my carnivorous boyfriend. The carrot cake hit my sweet spot and was the perfect way to end a great meal. Our server Alexandra was super friendly and very attentive. All of the staff were welcoming and it was great to meet the owner, Chef. It was a bit of a hike to get there from our hotel on the Strip (Monorail and taxi rides), but was well worth it.",

    "text": "Excellent service. Alex is beautiful, kind, attentive and efficient - she is the Best! The three stars are because though the food is fresh and made with pride and care it was not something that suited my paler and tastes very much.  For my tastes I found the steamed dumplings appetizer rather bland and characterless the only taste coming from the dipping sauce. I also had the Fruit Loops salad which which, while very fresh, had a smaller proportion/ratio of grilled fruit to greens than I would have liked. It also had very little dressing for my taste. For dessert I had the Brownie Sundae which had decent vanilla ice cream, not good (to my taste) chocolate ice cream and very plane/ordinary tasting brownie. It would have helped if the brownie was heated which it was not. One more reason for the three stars is that though they advertise that they make cold pressed juices they DO NOT offer any fresh squeezed juices without alcohol so if you want any fresh juices you are forced to order one of their cocktails! I got their version of a Pina Colada and was not pleased with the way it tasted. I must say that the veggie burger the lady next to me was having looked good, how good it tasted I do not know.",

We were only in Vegas for a few days, staying on the strip, and still came here more than once because it was so delicious. My husband really enjoyed the curry ketchup and, even though the fries look like a small portion, they're substantial. We left stuffed and happy each time. Also - the staff was unbelievably friendly.",

Showing up, the staff was friendly and I felt welcomed to be there. Everything on the menu looked delicious, and I ended up ordering what was the vegan knock off of a chicken sandwich. Not that this is relevant, but the flavor of the sandwich reminded me of Popeye's infamous sandwich and I was in LOVE with it. Now I have been to other vegan restaurants such as Seabirds in Southern California. This restaurant is definitely on par with others and doesn't shy away in flavor. I'll definitely be back and ready to enjoy this tasty, vegan food again.",

They use recyclable containers and I can tell from the feel of the plastic ware that it is biodegradable.

We ordered two local IPAs, which were hoppy and refreshing in the August desert heat. I ordered the pho, which was served traditionally with herbs and fresh vegetables. It was enormous but it left me feeling very satisfied, but not too full. She had the Nashville hot chick'n sandwich with fries, which was delicious and decadent. The chick'n patty was particularly good- light and fluffy and not-at-all chewy, like some plant-based meat alternatives. This is a great place to come for an affordable, satisfying, plant-based meal when traditional Vegas starts to wear on you. Enjoy!",

The wait was about 15 minutes, but they constantly gave us updates for when were next so that was nice. We could only order from the brunch menu.. so already I want to come back for their full menu!  Service was super friendly and everyone had a smile! It is pretty small inside, but most restaurants downtown have limited seating due to the building size, so comes with the turf. I looooved the decor and artwork in here; artistic and homey at the same time.  Now to the FOOD! We ordered the buffalo cauliflower to share (wow those are huge!!). I loved the dipping sauce because it had a little dill inside (more please so good).  For myself I got the Mac Daddy Burger. Topped with glorious Mac and cheese, collard greens, and a vegan beef patty; this tasty burger melted in your mouth and exploded with flavor. The only thing I was craving was a crunch on the burger. Next time, I'll add my fries on top for that extra bite I was missing! Other than that, I'd recommend VegeNation to anyone looking for a fresh, delicious bite in the chill ambiance of our downtown.",

They look interesting and taste even better.  Floutas - these turned out better than we expected. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, yum ! The sweet potato filling was mild and tortillas were perfectly done. Highly recommend these !   Bao wow - the boas were super soft, just the way i like them. And the fillings were on point. Loved the over all texture of the dish.   All in all we had a great dining experience at this place. Definitely one of the best vegan food we had in Vegas.",

My only critique is that the meatball grinder sandwich was a bit too bready, maybe opting for a thinner bread so I can enjoy the meatballs, cheese and sauce more. Lovely staff as well!",

Of course you could tell you were eating beets, but they paired wonderfully with the jalapeno chips.   Main dish I opted for the chicken pot pie gnocchi. DELICIOUS. I had to stop eating due to overload of food and extreme fullness... so so so good.   My friend then ordered the brownie sundae and I never would have been able to tell that everything was vegan.   EVERY DISH WAS VEGAN! This was like the dream restaurant that I wish Miami would open. Comfort vegan food without breaking the bank. I wish our city would learn that we need more spots like these in our lives.   Kudos to you guys, you have a new fan forreals!",

My bf didn't like the Tacos too much because for the Korean BBQ, he felt like he was eating a brisket with tortilla. It threw him off. Don't get me wrong, he liked it but he preferredthem as brisket instead of tacos.   The fries were good, but I felt like it was too thick, but I still liked them!

Yet the environment of the restaurant is earthy, artsy, and down-to-earth.  We tried to go back a second time during our trip, but it was pretty packed. It would have been a 30 minute wait, so we just ended up going elsewhere.   On our initial visit, I had the spinach gyoza/dumplings, and the black bean stuffed sweet potato. I don't think I can accurately describe how much the meal dazzled me. Everything was just superb.   If you come to Vegas for no other reason, you should come to try this spot. My carnivorous fiance loved it just as much as I did. This will be our first food stop the next time we visit.",

The pizza is always a good choice as are the potstickers.  For a lighter option, the pho is pho-nomenal! Tastes like a very flavorful broth.

The menu has many vegetarian and vegan options. Oh, and gluten free options, as well. The prices were very reasonable. The only little problem that we had was the excessive amount of flies surrounding our table. The server went back and forth apologizing but they didn't do anything about it. Same with the manager who came in and again, apologized, but did nothing. After we were completely done, we were asked if we wanted to move to another table. We didn't really finish out of satisfaction; we were finished because we were so annoyed with the amount of flies. We decided just to pack up and take it to go. So, bottom line is: great food, great place, reasonable prices, but not the most responsive customer service. They offered a free dessert and to sit at another table, after we were done packing our food to go.That server left, and eventually the manager walked in with a check which she cut 15% off of. I wouldnt have minded to pay the discounted 4 dollars. We honestly couldnt enjoy our lunch at all.  I do recommend. I will definitely go back; I'll just make sure to sit away from the entrance or even better, take my food to go. Bring a fly swatter! :D",

My friend ordered this and I stole more bites than he expected, the tofu, potato and chipotle spice mix in it was tasty what kept me coming back for more. The Perky Potion, a perfectly tasty pick me up alternative to drip coffee. I'm also, gf, dairy free and all those obnoxious things, so I give this place props for awesome tasty food   VegeNation, if you're reading this, please please add some gf toast to your menu. Even if it's frozen, we gf people would love extra sides :) Thanks",

    "text": "So much good!   Good for the environment, good for the people, and good for the wallet!  I had met Chef Donald at an event almost 2 years ago,  when I first learned about his all vegan restaurant he planned to open downtown.   Ever since then I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of VegeNation!  So, when Surprise! They opened almost a week earlier than they had originally stated, I needed to get my grub on ASAP.  I was there twice today, TWICE!  It is that good, it is that budget friendly, that I went for both lunch and dinner and I'm not ashamed!  Staff - perfectly nice and attentive.  I enjoy when I'm at a restaurant and I can feel that the server loves and believes in the food.  The servers aren't quite there yet,  but I take away no points because my understanding is that the servers weren't expecting the early opening either.   They were perfectly good servers,  this is just a preference of mine and I'm confident they'll get there.   Location - in the up and coming part of DTLV, walking distance from Container Park and such, easy on-street parking.  Decor/Ambience - Check out photos attached.  Very comfortable.    Lunch - CIAO MARGARITA PIZZA I'm not a big fan of Daiya, but the in house made sauce, charred grape tomatoes,  basil,  and perfectly cooked crust won me over.   MUCHAS GRACIAS Sweet Potato Quesadilla oh em gee, so freaking good, I can't even.  CHOCOLATE TACOS little pastry crisps filled with chocolate pudding,  topped with salted caramel,  berry, and coconut.  JAMAICAN HIBISCUS PUNCH caffeine free,  just enough sweetness, LEMONADE WITH COCONUT WATER AND CHIA SEEDS. I didn't taste this,  but it looked awesome and my friend loved it.    My omni Co worker was blown away by how good everything was.  My favorite tidbit from her was \"I am so satisfied, so full, yet I don't feel gross \"  Yup, welcome to Vegan food, my friend!  Dinner - MEATBALL GRINDER \"meat\" balls in that delicious red sauce on a toasted hoagie roll, topped with melted Daiya, served with a side of potato wedges and their own home-made ketchup.  The Hub's reaction \"I didn't realize how much I missed meatball parm\" (we've been vegetarian for many years) EAST WEST TACOS Jackfruit (mimics pulled pork) seasoned well,  topped with a Korean sauce and just the right amount of citrus (lime) to. Die. For.  BLACK BEAN CHILI  STUFFED SWEET POTATO this is actually a side item, and it tastes exactly as good as it sounds.   BROWNIE SUNDAE so effing good period.  DRINKS We had a drink that was Whiskey,  Cold Pressed Apple juice,  and cherry.   It was divine (and strong).  Also had the Mango Ceylon Iced Tea delish!  Price - for lunch,  before tip we were at $36 (2 meals,  2 drinks,  dessert)  for dinner,  before tip we were at $49 (2 meals,  1 alcoholic beverage,  1 non alcoholic beverage,  1 side,  dessert)  Incredible value considering our non-alcoholic drinks included free refills and the ingredients are organic whenever possible.   Bottom line - Highly Recommended.  Check out their website for more info including their mission statement.   Veggies and Omnis alike can appreciate the flavors, artistry, and feel good vibed of VegeNation",

We got the cauliflower buffalo wings to start - which came with an unbelievable ranch dipping sauce & celery. I ordered the chicken pot pie gnocchi & my boyfriend ordered the eggplant stack. Both were better versions of the real thing. We ordered the carrot cake for dessert & it was a great raw version that was less sweet. We noticed on yelp that they were giving a free spiced apple cider with a check-in. They said they recently changed that to sangria, which we happily accepted. It was very light & fruity. Amazing vibe in the restaurant & constantly busy, so I recommend you make a reservation!",

There are now several places I can frequent - Grass Roots, Simply Pure, Bronze Cafe and VegeNation!   I've eaten here more times than I can count and each time it gets better and better. My favorites are the guacamole, tamales, quesadillas, the meatless meatballs and the sliders. Oh who I am kidding...the entire menu is great and I've tried a lot of it!  Chef Donald is always there and comes out to the dining room quite often to check on the guests. I love little touches like this.  The back patio is nice for dining and enjoying some juice-tails, fresh juice with adult like beverages. Gotta love it! Healthy with a kick!  This is one of my new favorite spots and will be going back often!",

I ate the eggplant stacks and it wasn't what I was expecting, I barely ate any of it.  The ricotta was good but the eggplant was cut so thick that I didn't enjoy it.  I guess with the word \"stack\" I pictured lots of layers of thinly sliced and breaded eggplant, not two thick slices.  This may sound a bit fussy but like I said it just wasn't what I was expecting.  If I were back in Vegas I'd probably skip this spot and try something else.  I've had much better Vegan food.",

All the dishes are unique and offer a variety of dishes from \"Sushi\" to \"Pizza\" to \"burger and fries\" to \"Italian\" to \"Pho\" etc. My favorite dish is the Cauliflower Wings and the Pepperoni Pizza since I am a fan of buffalo wings and pizza. This place is located in downtown which is great bc you can visit places close by such as Fremont Street, Container Park, bars, etc. On certain days/times you have to pay for street parking or parking lots. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a chance even if you aren't vegan. I have eaten here at least 10 times in the past 12 months and I'll definitely be back.",

Our food came out quickly, and the presentation was great. We actually ended up eating here 3 times on our trip to vegas. We were here for breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast: I ordered the waffle it came with strawberry slices and blueberry sauce, it was fluffy and sweet. My boyfriend ordered the burrito and asked for it spicy. I really liked how accommodating they were and willing to make changes to our order-- he really likes his meals extra spicy. Lunch and dinner: I ordered the black bean chili stuffed  sweet potato and the Mexican hummus both times because they were SO good. We asked for Pico and guacamole with the hummus and the 3 together are the perfect combo. I had never thought of pairing sweet potatoes and black bean chili but I'm glad the chef did :) My boyfriend ordered the Russian standard made spicy again and wow! So much flavor! I really wish we had the recipe for this one.   Overall this was definitely our best dining experience during our Vegas trip, I can't wait to come back for more.",

Some of the dishes we all managed to eat and share were the East West jackfruit tacos (super fresh and tasty),  mushroom madness pizza (best pizza I have EVER had and fully vegan!), chicken and waffles (mindblowing), french toast platter, and the waffles (last two dishes came with lovely fresh fruit). I am so happy to have found another dedicated vegan restaurant in Las Vegas serving excellent food! The atmosphere and beautiful live music put the entire meal over the top. Vegenation is now on my list of favorite restaurants! Can't wait to go back!",

Then I had the Ellen Degeneres. It's was good. Probably won't order it again. My man had the Daniel Negraneau, which he said he LOVED his meaty balls. Also for a delicious drink. The Jamaican Hibiscus punch! It's like the nectar of the gods. Bonus, the people are extremely nice.",

Needless to say we walked out and went where we could recieve exceptional service. For a new place this is horrible review to recieve. We will never know if the food was good as we didnt get that far. Poor service and management will not have us returning.",

The staff is a joy- energetic and knowledgeable. So friendly, it feels like a home  away from home. Everything is delicious, fresh and beautifully presented. The restaurant itself is a comfortable blend of industrial modern, wood furniture, plant walls and neighborly touches; like the community table and pictures/info regarding community projects that they support and/or are involved, like gardens in the schools. We eat there several times per week and the quality and variety of the menu keeps us happy. We love that it's a vegan restaurant where our non vegan friends are happy to eat. Lastly, I have had over a dozen parties at my home for mixed demographic folks where Vegenation catered the food and everytime everybody was happy and wiped it out!!! And weeks later, people were still telling me how good the food was--really made us look good!!",

The ice cream was so creamy you'd never know it was all vegan.  The community table is great if you are a solo diner but the hi-chairs are metal and uncomfortable if you have a bodacious booty.  Cutlery could do with an upgrade.  Parking is a pain in the ass at $1.00ph.  Free street parking can be found on Carson and 9th Street.",

My biggest gripe about this place (and why there is only 4 stars) is there is not a baby changing table in the restroom, I probably never looked before but when your kid goes.......you gotta do what you gotta do. Seriously I think it should be illegal not to have a changing table. If you have a kids menu, you should have a changing table! End of story!! Also, parking-another gripe! I hate having to pay the parking meters to go have lunch. Although i understand it's not the restaurants fault, it is a pain (and those meter maids are not slacking)......probably the reason i have only been here twice.",

The food was about average, nothing that would encourage me to return.",

Prices are great. I checked in and the offer was for an apple pie cider but they were out so I got sangria which was yummy. We wanted to try the black bean chili sweet potato but it was out. I ordered the save the tuna AND the tamales. Both were delicious but I liked the tamales more. Our server was very nice. Overall just a great experience and can't wait to come back. We came on a Sunday and there was an estimated 25 minute wait, they call when you're ready so you can explore and the wait was half that. Will be back for the sweet potato!!",

David had Chicken (substitute of course) Pot Pie Gnocchi - herbs, peas, carrots, mushrooms, with pie with pie crust crumbles. No room for dessert, but if we could have, soooo many delicious options!

The tofu scramble was really good, with veggies mixed in - taking it to the next level. We also tried the black bean bowl but our biggest complaint was it had aLOT of potatoes and not enough tofu scramble. And no veggies. You must ask for some ketchup - it's made in house and it's amazing!  My review may have been 5 star if I'd had some of the lunch or dinner menu items. I'll be back again sometime and hopefully I can update my review!  FYI street or lot parking is $2 per hour.   We went back for dinner. Totally different experience. Everything we had was - wow!  Sushi is amazing, the bao bun had great flavors, the veggie burger was outstanding and dessert - CHEESECAKE. Wow. I'm sad we are leaving town but Vegenation will be on our list for all future visits!",

Its lite and airy and full of live plants! Quirky and whimsical for the win!  The service was quick and friendly and the menu had lots of options - something to be had for everyone.   We skipped the appetizer but they did look good. We opted for the veggie burger and the curry. SO SO GOOD! The curry was fresh and satisfying and the burger was delicious even if it fell apart a bit.   For drinks we had the hibiscus iced tea (could have been a little sweeter) and a fresh squeezed chia seed lemonade.  Overall this was a very high quality and pretty restaurant.

I think what bummed me out is we have authentic Pho here that is meat-free and it is really good.  This was Pho with a spin, which just isn't what I wanted.  Husband also ate here, and thought it was tasty.  He thought the dessert was pretty tasty.  Small and I would guess can get overrun with patrons but delicious and fresh.",

However, Wynn hotel restaurants are just too expensive for us.  I decided to order it.  It was DELICIOUS!   Also the portion was big.  The side dish was yummy potatoes.  I almost could not finish it.    Hubby ordered French Toast and that too was a big portion.  It was topped with fruit and he loved the sauce on the side.  They have scheduled events and specials.

Thai curry bowl was full of freshness and bursting with flavor. My tacos and Pozole soup  (daily special) was perfect for lunch and I love hominy.

We eat very clean at home (organic, vegan, gluten free and avoid chemicals and canola oil)so it may be an imgredient they use that we are sensitive to.   Our child used to love the gluten free grilled cheese when they served follow your heart cheese but doesnt like the daiya they switched to (neither do i personally). Fyh has healthier and tastier ingredients which is important to us.   I havent been back to this location in a while after we got our last to-go order and our child wouldnt even eat his food because he said he didnt like it. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. I just hope the restaurant makes healthier /tastier choices. we mentioned to them a few times that fyh was much more appealing than daiya, thinking maybe they were just out of fyh but it seems they switched.",

I understand that people make mistakes-my driver grabbed someone else's order which I got instead, couldn't eat it-am allergic to one of the ingredients. It's when I called, that a young girl by the name of Damaris, maybe 12 yo, answered the phone. I wanted to simply express my issue to her but she was surprisingly rude and didn't even issue an apology much less seemed empathetic to what I was saying. She seemed pre-occupied and talking to other people whilst we were on the phone and continued to address me as \"Sir\" when clearly I'm a female. She continued to talk over me and was quite short with me not taking the time to just listen. I can only hope this situation gets resolved. Why do you even have someone working like that in this business, which would be detrimental to any business! Great customer service, friendliness and understanding go a long way in the food & beverage industry, especially when you have great restaurants progressing incredibly in the Vegan world. Vegas has grown immensily in this realm and we need those people that care, not toddlers picking up phones all day, hitting buttons and projecting nonsense.",

They are also good about making accommodations for dietary restrictions, so I was able to get the tacos modified to be soy-free. It meant that several of the toppings listed on the menu had to be eliminated, so I'm sure it would have been better the original way, but it still tasted good. I just wish they had offered to add something else instead of just taking off half the stuff. But in any case, I would still go back. The CBD tea was also great!",

Everything I ordered was tasty and full of flavor. There also was a DJ.. DOPE! The restaurant was clean and energetic.   Food Side Salad: Sometimes women go on dates and order salads to be cute. I must say, I was very hungry by the time I made it to the restaurant. The way I ate this salad was not cute at all. The green goddess dressing they put with it is perfect. I ordered a second one to take home!  Mushroom Pizza: Another really great dish. Loaded with mushrooms and all the flavor one could ask for.  Jamaican Hibiscus Punch: Good. Could've used a little lemon juice to balance the sweetness.  Kids Sundae (No Toasted Coconut): I ordered an extra one to take with me!",

We also had the side of red beans and quinoa and basically got red kidney bean soup with very little quinoa. The \"sushi\" roll appetizer had 1/2 of the pieces full size and 1/2 of the pieces were 50% smaller. It seems like there are inconsistencies just about every time we go, which is about once per month. I also have never seen the same people working - which seems strange to me. Maybe it's the nature of the beast in Vegas restaurants to struggle to keep the same waitstaff. I wish they'd pay more to keep the same people there or at least have an obvious front end manager which I have never observed.",

I'm not vegan but I've been to many vegan/ vegetarian restaurants. I appreciate the art it takes to creat vegan options since there's a lot of ingredients to substitute in the everyday meals most of us eat.   The ambience is beautiful, I love the plants and arts on the walls. The rustic/ modern design is nice, there was a live Dj which really put the beginning experience over the top. We walked in and was quickly seated. Our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink, we gave her our order and off she went. To be honest it took a good 10 15 minutes just to get drinks which was a iced chai and an iced coffee. The long wait didn't really bother us since we were catching up but after awhile it became ridiculous. There were parties that came in after us that got their food before we could order. I kept having to catch our waitress attention just to get her to help us. I'm not sure if she forgot about us because we were somewhat in the corner but the place wasn't busy to not see us. It was about 30 minutes of us sitting there until we got to place our order. Then it took about another half an hour for us to get our food. I ordered the Free the tuna appetizer and meatball sandwich and my sister got the Vegenation sandwich. With the time it took to get our food I expected a lot more. My bread was soggy and the food wasn't even warm it was colder then what I would expect and the fries where so burnt and hard I couldn't it break it in half with my hands. My sisters burger was so mushy that she had to eat it with a fork and her fries weren't better then mine. So sad. I asked for our check and my free Sunday with the Yelp check in. I requested it to go because to be honest I didn't want to have to wait an hour for it. By the time we got our check and was able to pay for our meal we had to rush back to our meatier since the two hours that we added had already expired before we could go on our marry way to the container park.   So with this devastating experience I won't recommend my fellow vegan and vegetarian friends nor will I be back. There's better restaurants with food that doesn't taste like it's been sitting there and service that actually feels like they want your business.",

As we came in, it was very busy which to me, was a good sign. However the reason we couldn't get seated (even when there was available seats) was because they said they were backed up. So after 15 min we were seated and literally waited 20 mins for our appetizers and 30 more min for our other main courses. We got here at 2:30pm and didn't finish up until 4pm with our final meals. The quality of food is awesome, however it was not worth an hour and a half wait. I will try you guys again in a few months, I know this place is new so maybe some kinks need to be worked out.

Got the Check-in offer which was their Sangria.. wasn't a big fan of it..reminded me of those Bud Light Splash drinks. Ordered My Little Dumplings as an appetizer the filling was good just the dough was mushy to the point where'd it uncomfortably stuck to my teeth. Along with the Hot Tamale.. wasn't my favorite had too much masa and was very bland.They do serve alcohol and make their own juices. Got a pina colada which was good ratio from juice to booze. My boyfriend got a American Mule which instead of ginger beer they used carrot juice and it was DELICIOUS! For entree I got the curry noodle thing?(don't remember the name) it was flavorless and regretted ordering it. Just got the Madness Mushroom and that was the only appetizing thing I ate there ..if they didn't have chili flakes I would've rated it the same as everything else I had tasted. I'd probably go back for the drinks but the food wasn't as excepted. Need more FLAVOR and SPICE. The food tasted all the same just in different textures. This place is definitely visited by people for the 'hype'",

    "text": "I was so excited when I found out that there was another all vegan restaurant in Vegas, not a vegan cafe or sandwich shop, but an actual sit-in experience. By all means I am not vegan, but nonetheless I loved my experience at VegeNation.  The atmosphere was great, with a cute setup and lots of cool looking plants that made our meal more enjoyable. Service was right on! Our server always checked up on us and was very knowledgeable. Food was awesome! Try the Save the tuna (vegan sushi) you won't regret it. Did not have real fish in it obviously, but it was just as satisfying as real sushi. I also had the Pamela Anderson, which is their take on a taco including a lettuce wrap for the shell and fresh veggies inside.   Although this place is great, I wouldn't recommend eating here for dinner or bringing anyone that is not familiar with vegan food. Great experience, but the value to portion ratio is pretty off. $12 for three vegetable tacos on the smaller side. I left happy, but just not completely full.",

    "text": "I am not a foodie. I am not a strict vegetarian,  and I am not a vegan. But if I lived in Las Vegas I would be all of those things because I could eat at Vegenation anytime I want.    We went to Vegenation to try something different and because it was walking distance from the fun at Fremont Street. It is only one street away from the bars,  lights, loud music, and pizza places but in that one short block you find yourself in what feels like a neighborhood restaurant staffed with very friendly young people who clearly enjoy their jobs and everything about the foods they prepare and serve.   We like to try different places when we travel but Vegenation was so good we went two nights in a row during a short visit to Las Vegas. After the first visit  were sure that we would be disappointed with any other choice. The food, location, cleanliness, service,  and atmosphere are all perfect. I didn't even notice the price because we were trying different things. The food was so good we gave our complete-stranger table neighbors one of our tacos just so they could try something they discussed but didn't order. None of us knew what jackfruit was or how good it could be...   The black bean hummus with blue corn chips and steamed spinach/mushroom dumplings with herb soy sauce are great. The east West tacos are **shockingly** good. I had to Google jackfruit (the pork substitute in the tacos) and am amazed that they are so good. Three tacos are huge,  tasty,  and filling. They are not a compromise from real BBQ pork tacos; they are better. I am an occasional carnivore,  I live in Texas where tacos and BBQ are everywhere,  and I could eat these tacos every,  single,  day. We enjoyed the tacos and thank every yelp member who suggested them.  I don't have enough superlatives for the mushroom pizza. Just buy one. Eat it. Be happy. Write your own review and keep a thesaurus handy to find synonyms for \"delicious,\" \"perfect,\" and \"fresh.\" Okay,  I'll try. We ordered this two days in a row; it was always hot. The crust was always perfect. We could not have eaten more,  and none went to waste. The tomato sauce is so intensely fresh and tomato tasting I wanted to thank the chef AND the farmer. The mushrooms are also intensely flavored, perfectly seasoned,  and sauteed to perfection before they go on the pizza. Cilantro makes it taste even more fresh. Really,  really good. We are UNHAPPY that our hotel room doesn't have a refrigerator ONLY because we would have ordered an extra pizza each day to snack on. Get one. You won't regret it. The two other pizza options looked equally good but we just didn't want to take the chance...   90 % of restaurants just follow the program of feeding you in their theme,  and getting you in and out. Maybe 8 % really care about their food and the dining experience. A tiny 2 % do all of those things and care about what you are putting in your body whether it be the best beef,  rare ingredients, youghtful preparation and presentation, or just ingredients that are healthy,  fresh,  and thoughtfully prepard. That last group is a very rare and cherished group,  in my book,  and they range from tiny kitchens to Michelin starred restaurants. Vegetation is in the top 2 %. I will ALWAYS visit in Las Vegas and pine for it elsewhere.   Five stars.   Great food.   Great experience.   Great location.   Get so much food for 30 bucks (for two) that you give some of it away.   I hate typing on my phone. I hate staying up late. I did both because I want everyone who reads this to try the restaurant out.   The only con for this restaurant is that I can't pack the entire restaurant it in my luggage and take it home.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go here forever.. I'm talking months ago!  and since it is a little out of my way, I decided to just go by myself.  And too bad it was a little disappointing!   The food is pretty good, I'm used to paying more for vegan food and this place, expect to spend at least $11 a dish for entrees. They have a good selection of appetizers to salads, juices and desserts.   I got a few food and just really wanted to try a bit of everything. I ate one thing and boxed everything else.   I tried the save the tuna as an appetizer, Carne Asada tacos, East West Tacos, Italian Dumplings and Chocolate Tacos.  The tacos was definitely filling, I had one and I was already feeling full but my favorite was Italian dumplings. They're a little small but so good! The East West Tacos were my least favorite. It was super soggy and didn't think it was any special.. Which was a bummer cause it was the one I've been wanting to try! The dessert was yummy They are so tiny! So I feel a little good about that but not the price, for $7 a little pricey! I know overall it was good and my brothers are excited for me to give them the left overs.  Let's talk about service.. Man, I hate bashing on servers but it was ridiculous. My server was inattentive and never smiled nor greeted me. It didn't look too busy but I tried to be positive that she might be. But I was just ignored a lot, I mean.. I was in a back table.  I was greeted by a nice lady and she was nice enough to let me sit on a table by a plug so I can charge my phone. I was going to skype with my friend who lives in Taipei . He has been wanting to see the place since I've been talking to him about how cool this place looks. But idk if it's just my phone but it was having a hard time with the internet, as soon as I left it was fine. I actually couldn't even check in on Yelp till I got out.   Anyways, I tried to ask for silverware but my server left.. She literally would drop off food and not spend less than 2 seconds on my table. I didn't even have enough time to tell her that I wanted to modify my food... She didn't tell me any specials (Taco Tuesday 's Pop up Carne Asada) I couldn't decide on the Italian dumpling or East West Taco so I turned to my server's opinion but she just said it depends on what I want. (Okayyyy, err helpful?)  She said her favorite was the dumplings.. But she didn't even tell me what was in it or anything about the Carne Asada, which I was curious what was actually in it since all it said on the Pop up special board was \"Carne Asada\" and she left. I had no silver, no napkins.. After trying to flag down 4 servers I got up and went to the station and grab my own damn napkin. Like I said, I was trying a few dishes and taking it home for my brothers but I didn't appreciate how they put the rest of my order in to go boxes. I wanted to sit there longer and actually enjoy my food.. A different server was close by and I ordered the dessert since my server dropped off my food in a to go container with the check. By that time I was just okay, this blows. I just ate my tiny dessert and paid.  Total was $51.67 but I did get 3 entrees, 1 app and 1 dessert. The dessert should definitely cost less... All 3 tacos would have fit on my palm.   Parking: It was $1 = 15 mins, I guess there's a pro in my bad service otherwise I would have gotten a fine. I was sitting in the parking lot as I type this and a security personnel told me I was overtime. So make sure you put enough time! Definitely strict about paying the meter.   Anyways, I would have given this place a 4 star because the food is good, the atmosphere is nice and the place looks clean and very trendy. But alas, service does make a huge difference. I probably won't be back for a long time, but good option for Vegans!",

The food was some of the best vegan food i've had in a very long time!  I have a dairy allergy, and have been trying to cut back on gluten--neither of which are easy to do in Vegas!--and this place was a breath of fresh air!  I only wish it was closer to the strip so we didn't have to rent a car!    My husband and I started with the dumplings--amazing!  then i had the East West Tacos and he had the spaghetti and \"meatballs\".  both of these entrees were also gluten free.  My husband is a die-hard meat-a-tarian, while i've been Pescatarian/almost vegetarian for about 2 yrs now, and he said he could not tell the difference between what he had and real meat.  It's not easy to fool him, either, and they succeeded!  We finished off with a Vegan/GF carrot cake for me and Vegan/GF cheesecake for him.  both were good but i thought his cheesecake was better.  Staff were great and very attentive, which, when we first came in, i wasn't sure they would be because all the servers were sitting at a back table playing on their cell phones.  but they checked in often and were great!  Very affordable too!  This place is a must-do every time we are in Vegas!",

We have been here about 3 or 4 times now and it is always a great experience. The staff is always friendly and answers all of our questions every time we come in. I did my birthday brunch here in February and some of our party was late but they didn't mind. They were super accommodating with our party and kept checking on us in case we were ready.  Our favorites: \"Chicken\" & Waffles, French Toast, Food not bombs, Ellen DeGeneres (I think they got rid of this tho), tamales, and the SUSHI! Every experience has been great, food has never disappointed.  One server sticks out for us, I wish I knew her name, she is my favorite so far. She looks like Kerry Washington, absolutely  gorgeous and has a great attitude. She joked around with our table and when we told her she reminded us of Kerry she seemed to appreciate the compliment. I wish I knew her name but hey to her manager- SHES THE BEST.  We are definitely forever customers of this establishment.",

Everything was (shockingly) reasonably priced, and very delicious! I had the eggplant and kale in vodka sauce- I forgot what it's called- with their spiked apple cider and bread pudding. The pasta was creamy, the drink was perfectly spiked, the pudding was yummy and it was all vegan! I also tried a friend's green curry and the burger which were also incredible. I want to come back every week! The staff seemed to be very friendly and quick with service. This is a MUST for any vegans or just food lovers!",

If you're not, you should; it's not weird hippy food, it's yummy, filling, plant-based goodness. I tried the gnocchi yesterday and it was great comfort food that reminded me of springtime back east, a welcome addition to the menu.  Today, I came back for the Vegenation burger! Ahh the joys of being a local in Vegas! Chef Donald and company never disappoint.  Thank you!",

My husband and I have been going to VegeNation since it's soft opening and we have progressively watched it go downhill. The food is hit or miss with a lot more misses and the service is horrible. Last night we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our water after we had already sat down. Our server finally greeted us with, \"Hey guys, sorry\" and no prompt to order anything. After an awkward silence i went ahead and ordered our entire nights menu in case i wouldn't get an opportunity to order again, which seemed probable with the service we already had. The food was very mediocre. We ended up wishing we got Taco Bell. Would have been a better meal.   Two stars because the work they are doing with students in the valley is very admirable. Also, CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ARE AMAZING. One thing that will keep us back. If you are a vegan looking to be wowed, go on saturday mornings and get the chicken and waffles. Any other time will be disappointing.",

We ordered the Ellen Degeneres raw collard tacos (partly because of the name) and the East West jackfruit tacos. We also ordered one carrot cake to go. Both of the entrees were awesome! Though the way they cut the limes made it hard to squeeze any juice out of them onto the tacos. The carrot cake was pretty great too though I think the desserts were a bit overpriced at least for the size of the carrot cake. I probably would go with a different dessert next time just because I've had better vegan carrot cake at other places. But all in all the food was great. I would definitely come back! The interior was the cutest restaurant I've ever seen and would make for a fun dining experience.",

We got the same thing the next morning too (not worth it to eat typical diner style food)!  I am bummed that we did not go back for lunch...but there is always next time I am in Vegas!",

I had heard mixed reviews so was a little nervous to try them but they did not dissapoint.  It is a LARGE portion, could easily be shared by two people.  The chicken had a nice flavor and texture very similar to real chicken, without the guilt.  THe waffles are fluffy and soft, NOT crispy (i like them soft but i know some people prefer crispy waffles so maybe u could ask for them well-done if thats a deal breaker? ) the fries were cooked well, but a tad underseasoned. I do wish salt and pepper was provided at the tables.  The homemade ketchup was amazing tho!!! And the maple syrup...oh my! I dipped my fries in it hee hee.  All in all, i liked this dish better than the chikn m waffles offered at the wynn, and its $7 cheaper and twice as big! So SCORE! Cant wait to be back to try the chicken pot pie nochi!",

However, the only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because I found the portions to be insanely small for the price. I'm not one for giant heavy meals. But my 120lb frame still needs to eat more than 3 small lettuce tacos as an entree. At least jam those puppies with more veggies or maybe consider adding one or two more tacos in the mix. I hate spending $50 and still go home hungry.",

I'll start off by saying that most of the food was really good but they have a super slow kitchen. Restaurant wasn't full. 20 minutes for appetizer, another 30 for the entree. Everyone around was twiddling their thumbs. The free sangria with check-in was a nice plus while waiting...  The food: Buffalo Cauliflower had too much sauce and could have been crispier Bao Wow was not marinated or seasoned well. It just tasted like plain tofu with blah mushrooms. A suggestion would to have used jackfruit and cooked it down like with the flavors of a bao pork bun. Pot pie gnocchi and pineapple pizza were awesome.   Not sure if it's just because they are newer but their kitchen needs to make a few changes to be more efficient. Maybe the next time I'm in Vegas I'll give it another try.",

Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi - Good. Tasted similar to an actual chicken pot pie.  Downtown Tony - Bad. The sliders were dry and flavorless. The sriracha aioli had an \"off\" flavor. The \"fries\" (which were more like large potato wedges) were BLAND BLAND BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. Isn't salt vegan??  Pho - Meh. Broth was alright, a little light on the flavor. Tofu was literally just diced up and thrown in. Too many sprouts and not enough noodles.  I would maybe have the pot pie gnocchi again if I was in the area but would not recommend going out of your way to check out this spot. I have had excellent vegan cuisine before (The New Vegan in Delray Beach, FL. Go.) and overall Vegenation missed the mark for me. Far too pricey for what amounts to average food.",

    "text": "Ehhhh... I wanted to like it. I really did. I know that flavors and textures are going to be different when trying to recreate Omnivorous dishes with Vegan ingredients.  I wasn't expecting my \"meatball sub sandwich\" to taste like its namesake, but I wanted it to taste good. It didn't.   The grilled cheese, that tasted great, like a savory Gruyere melt. But the texture - smooth at first - quickly became paste-like and caused a traffic jam at the back of my throat, making it difficult to swallow.   The Buffalo cauliflower was AWESOME. I suspect that every dish that isn't trying to be something it's not is probably excellent, but that's not the majority of the menu.   I have to say that I didn't complain at all, complimented the food when the server asked, because everyone around me did as well.  But later on, my entire party all said something to the effect of \"yeah, it was OK... But... Yeah, not going back.\"  I think we all wanted to believe.    Essentially this place is the culinary equivalent of the Emperor's New Clothes.  I don't know if that's my fault or theirs, but not going back.   Service is awesome though.",

    "text": "2 stars for the options available on the menu, today maybe wasn't a great day in the kitchen?   Craving a brownie Sunday, we came here excited to enjoy some ice cream and chocolate. After we were seated, it took about 10 mins before anyone else acknowledged we were there. While seated in the middle, we met our server and we decided to immediately place our orders...we were ready, 2 Sunday's please!  After 20 mins, we started noticing other people getting their food who were seated after us. Maybe those dishes were super easy to get together? Maybe it was super busy? No. Another 5 mins come by and a person in our trio received her steamed dumplings...no sign of the brownie order.  Aha! Finally roll in our Sunday's, just as we were about to ask about them. The waitress set them down and walked away...but something didn't look right!   Bowl 1: Hardly had ingredients inside, the bowl wasn't 1/2 full. The banana's were extremely thin and very very small, a spoonful size. The abundance of strawberries were adamant and sprinkled with walnuts/shredded coconut. To me it looked sad! Bowl 2: Filled to the top with ice cream and the same duo slivers of banana within the melted mess. No strawberries, no walnuts, a little bit of coconut...it's as if this bowl had been left out while we were waiting and completely melted!   I finally seen the waitress again to tell her this didn't look right. She insisted this was the correct order and that she \"told them many times to remake it in the back and they refused...so..\" Then shrugged her shoulders and put her hands in the air as if to suggest 'I don't know', then walked away.   I physically took the melting pot and brought it over to her and said: \"Look, we're not gonna eat a bowl of melted ice cream. This doesn't even have a brownie underneath..can you just take it back and ask they remake it?\". Again, she told me they wouldn't and she'd comp the meal. She seemed frustrated with the kitchens behavior already. I left the bowl with her and shared the small Sunday waiting at the table...but wait! I needed a spoon!!  After flagging down someone, anyone who would look up, I asked for a spoon to eat the Sundae, and was given a Won Ton soup spoon to eat with while my friend had a regular spoon utensil!!!!!     Mind. Blown.",

    "text": "If you're Vegan and staying downtown, there's only a few choices to eat at. Not that there's a ton of choices on the strip either. Just so happens that both of your main downtown options are within a block or so of each other downtown.  If you love Veggie Grill type junk food like I do, then you'll thoroughly enjoy what VegeNation has to offer. We came for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on three separate days during our visit to Vegas. So you could say I'm a bit of a fan. While everything on the menu isn't a slam dunk, most everything is as delicious as it sounds.  We were overwhelmed with the menu choices during our first visit. We ended up going with a few of the most popular dishes.  VegeNation Burger: The patty was a bit soft which normally would be an instant mood killer. However with this \"super foods\" burger, it kinda works. There was so much flavor in this that I didn't even think about how soft the burger was until I was several bites deep. By then it didn't matter. This was good!  Save the Tuna: This lil' roll could compete with anything from the world famous Shojin in LA. The toothsome forbidden rice that they chose to use gets a special mention for being an actually tasty alternative to white rice.  Muchos Gracias: This chipotle flavored Quesadilla, was pretty tasty, if overpriced for what you get at $11. It's not very filling as an entree. It could also use some substance inside that adds extra bite to it to keep it from being too mushy. It had great flavor though and I would order it again if it were a few dollars less.  East West Taco: Despite the apparent popularity of this, I wasn't a fan. It had a good fusion of flavors but nothing really stood out. It was also missing some much needed crunch.  French Toast: Delicious, well done with a flavorful almond butter spread on the side. This one didn't need any maple syrup to taste great. The fruit cup it comes with doesn't make you forget that there's only 3 half slices of French toast here. As my babygirl asked me, what the hell do they do with the other half a slice? It's worth noting that @ $11, for a few bucks more you get much thicker Texas toast over at the Wynn. And yes, there's 4 slices on your plate there.  Chicken & Waffles: While it doesn't seem to be a regular breakfast item, they have been offering it on what they call the \"pop up menu\". If it's available while you're there, get it. It's a well made, tasty, crispy waffle. The chicknon that they use is a Gardein patty that is flavorful and well seasoned. They added a side of their thick cut homefries to the dish in an attempt to make the plate less bare. However, I would rather see a side of tofu scramble or something instead.  While some of the dishes were 5 stars, there were some that fell somewhere in between. Overall the food is about 4 stars. Service is what takes VegeNation to the next level. Our waiter on the first day was phenomenal. He stood out from a rotating cast of other fine service staff.   Despite eating here 3 days in a row, I can't wait to go back! That's a testament to my love of their food and mission statement.",

Everybody was super friendly and went out of their way to help if you needed anything. The vibe is great and it was a nice break from the Strip for us.   The Cauliflower wings and ranch were the best I've ever had, and I would come back just for them. My boyfriend enjoyed his Pho, although he said it was kind of bland. Adding in some seasoning fixed that for him right away. I got the burger, and it was also a little bland. The fries were amazing, though.   Overall, I liked Vegenation and I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I am so happy to have found Vegenation during my Vegas stay. We came for a health and fitness conference and many of us enjoy plant based dietary choices. Some have gluten and dairy limits.  I am not a vegan, but eat mostly plant based. I felt invited and not judged. That is fairly hard in this type of circle, so thank you.   We were told to try your restaurant by other vegans in the area. My friends were both plant based, vegetarian and vegan that I came with. We also met the 2 influential vegan lifestyle body building pros at Vegenation in town for the conference.   I got a wonderful starter of buffalo cauliflower, ranch, and celery. Delicious!   I followed it with a meal, I returned. It was great, but I dont like curry and it didnt say it had it in their on the menu. I couldn't order much else because I have an allergy to chipotle and it was in almost everything, even their black beans. And a sensitivity to mushrooms so that knocked out a few others. I just followed up with a dessert, chocolate tacos. They were yummy, a little salty, but very good. teeny tacos, could use to be bigger.   I would have tried many other things had they used cayenne and not chipotle...but it is the trendiest spice right now besides turmeric so I get it. I did think too much of one flavor limits a menu though, especially in a plant based field. It would have been nice to see some interesting salads and soups and maybe some dipping bread. I have tried so many places in Seattle with the vegetarian vibe and I think Vegenation could do so much more with their passion.   But it was flavorful and great service, I would go again, if chipotle wasn't so prominent. Their ranch was perfect! I would buy a bottle.",

From the cool art and design (that oh-so-instagrammable plant wall), to the friendly service and amazing food, I always leave here feeling happy.   I have brought people here from all walks of life and have yet for someone not to find something they enjoyed. The colorful save the tuna roll is a MUST! And the cauliflower wings are a close second in the appetizer/snack category.   If the thought of vegan food makes you nervous, I would recommend  the meatball sandwich, or spaghetti and meatballs. If the thought of vegan food does not make you nervous, I would still recommend those items because the meatballs are delicious....and I know my way around balls. *cough*  The stuffed sweet potato is filling, and comforting, and my husband is a huge fan of the chicken pot pie gnocchi.   They often have fun and creative pop-ups, especially on weekends. (Their chicken and waffles is very popular, but not my thang.)   They offer a variety of great drink options - I love the coconut water lemonade with chia seeds, and their sangria. If I didn't live so far away I would likely eat here a few times a week, hoping they expand to summerlin, or even better for me, the NW soon.",

One of the downsides to this location is the space itself - it's shaped like an awkward L, which seems to slow down waitstaff response time, and makes you feel crammed - especially if you are in the long, Bavarian-style (kinda) booth. The other downside to this location is paying for parking, although they will give you $2 off of your bill if you can present your ticket. Try out their spaghetti and meatballs, pizzas, and tiramisu - avoid their Thursday vegechanga popup and buffalo cauliflower starter (only a few pieces of cauliflower are included so it's not worth the price point).",

All the food is on the menu like you'd find at another restaurant, but with more plant based options of course. However, the secret is that all the things that would normally be animal products are plant substitutes! For the veggies and vegans out there, this is the spot! And for the gluten free, many menu items are also labeled as GF! Happy day for everyone with dietary restrictions. They nicely label all the meals with gluten and nut ingredients.   The food is amazing. I talked about it for a few days afterwards. I ordered the eggplant stacks because I love me some eggplant and cheese. I have never had vegan cheese and this dish tasted out of this world! The portion looked rather small to me but it was surprisingly filling. It was packed with flavor. My friend ordered a salad and it was perfectly sized and no complaints in the taste.   The restaurant is full of plants and art! The staff were all very friendly and attentive, even helping me to find a drink that would be okay for me. I really appreciated that. There isn't a lot of seating, but we had no problem finding a spot at the usual dinner time rush. Most tables are smaller with a large one for groups. The location is right by the container park and Fremont street so you can do some adventuring before or after your meal. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here a lot.",

We hadn't been eating well because we were on a road trip and sometimes it's very hard to find vegan places on the road. We were excited to try this place out since it had amazing reviews and upon entering- super cute.   Now I've eaten at quite a few vegan restaurants in the Bay Area and had splendid experiences with them. However there weren't a lot of items on VegeNation's menu that looked appetizing. We opted for a couple recommended dishes and I ordered a salad. I did not enjoy any of the dishes we tried. =(!! Of course my boyfriend was like... it's hard to judge their main courses since I ordered a salad. BUT! I've had plenty of salads that blew me away and I went WOW that's a good salad. This restaurant did not do that for me. I thought it was bland and their toppings were eh.   When in Vegas, I will not return here to eat. There's another vegan restaurant in walking proximity to VegeNation that I liked better.",

I was a bit underwhelmed by the overall taste of the veggie burger and also the thai curry...( way to soupy and not enough veggies) The service was just so so.. Overall a 3 for the taste of the food and service. Another small thing..the water is in small mason jars( need to be larger)..and not very cold. I wish it had tasted better ..  I was not sure if it was filteted or not It is a nice menu and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fconcept.It&s=36efb4b1975df3026ab51d2379e035323a3ec473f93f3b084b9fca3ca2c96b2b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">concept.It</a> was. a clean interior  and always great to see a vegan option while I am on vacation.",

First Hostess told me if meter not working I didn't have to pay (you taking care of the ticket?).  Then hostess refused to give me change for a $5. Asked the manager who said they didn't have it.  Seriously?  I want to spend money at your restaurant.   It was Mother's Day and really wanted a nice dinner.  Pho-King-Delicious was good.  Spicy but lacking depth to the flavor.  My Daughter had Mama Mia (Spaghetti and \"meatballs:) Tasted like tomato sauce.  Had to ask for salt and pepper to make it have any flavor at all. Service was just ok.  I like the idea and hope they can up the flavor.  I would make sure to have change for the meters.   Not sure I will try it again. For the price there are better tasting options.",

The pizza was my least favorite--the marinara had the consistency and tart acidity of tomato paste and did nothing to accent the flavor of the mushrooms or herbs, which were masked. The Daiya was uneeded and wasn't really tastable anyway. The crust was great and I'd love to have them work out something better for this. I saved the DN sub for later and enjoyed the meatballs. I concur about the lack of sauce--and the same criticism applies regarding flavor. The Pho-King-Delicious was flavorful and fresh. The Chocolate Tacos are great in theory, but the flavors could use some balance--the salt overpowered the sweet. I hope this place strives to improve. The service was wonderful and I would go back just to get some more dumplings",

I didn't catch the name of our waitress but she was so very kind as well. She guided us through the menu and chef specials. We ordered a Pina Colada, Save the Tuna, Tofu Bao Buns, East West Tacos, Gotta Get Over the Hemp, and the Brownie Sundae! Wow we were so filled. Oh, let me also note that I am not a vegetarian nor vegan. Each dish was very flavorful, anyone would love it here. At first I thought the prices were a bit expensive for the minimum amount of food served per order, but wow looks are deceiving. Do not be mistaken because you will be so satisfied, you'll hit food coma as we did. Haha. Anyway, overall a great place for those who are vegan or not! Reasonable prices, great atmosphere and great staff. I'll be back for sure to try more!",

Alex, the server was wonderful, very pleasant and good at what she does. And she made sure to let us know that Grub Hub is who they use for delivery service when I asked.  I ordered the Downtown Tony Sliders and the mushrooms were great, the bun was fresh and the fries that come with it are seasoned perfectly. My husband had the pho. The portions and the ingredients were a perfect mix, the smell lets you know in advance that it is going to be yummy. I also ordered the lemonade, coconut water with chia (which of course was exactly what I had been wanting). I notice others commenting about the cost, I found it to be very reasonable, especially considering the type of natural foods, and of course the love that was cooked in to it.   If I had to say anything negative about VegeNation it would be that a) it isn't closer to my house, and b) it could be larger.   We will be back since I saw something about Happy Hour specials and who can resist a special.",

    "text": "TL;DR - Eat here, you'll like it. Be sure to have a cocktail.  I ate here because my wife is currently eating Vegan (we had too much Franklin BBQ in Austin last month and needed to drop the weight) and I wanted to take her someplace where they had Vegan food (not just salads).  It's around the corner (south and west) from the Downtown Container park (which I regularly take visitors to because its cool and I like to scare them when the Giant Praying Mantis flamethrower antennas shoot 30' flames) - but I had never driven on that street, so I didn't know it existed until I found it on yelp.  Food was very good.  I had the Italian \"meatball\" sandwich - I couldn't tell it apart from a real meatball sub if you asked me to.  I don't remember what my wife ordered, but I tasted it and it was good too.  Its a real restaurant with tables and waiters, not a order at the counter place like Veggie Grill.   This is the only vegan place other than the Veggie Grill chain (mostly in California, none in Las Vegas) that I can recommend.  I've eaten at a number of \"Vegan\" restaurants before and about half are terrible because Vegan is usually a political statement about not eating animals. This means that the food is very limited (or terrible - like raw food places) or uses substitutes that don't taste as good as the real items (eggs, milk, cheese, butter, meat).  Also, the staff at vegan places tend to be vegan too which usually means a lot of weird servers.    This place was good.  Our waiter was normal, they did have another guy with a purple mohawk (very punk) haircut and the waitresses had multiple earrings, nose rings, etc.  They all seemed pretty nice and professional and no one seemed to be pushing an agenda.  This place has a limited menu, but the food is very good.  only thing we said \"meh\" to was one of the desserts - the cheesecake (which obviously doesn't have real cheese in it) was kind of gritty and not creamy.  I would pass on it.  I had the 3 choco tacos and they were good.    I had a Pina Colada cocktail drink and it was the best I've ever had in my life.  It probably because they have a juice bar so they fresh press and squeeze their juices here (verses getting it from a can of Dole juice anyplace else) - so it was really, really delicious.  prices were very reasonable.  i will eat and drink here again.   Its pay street parking, but they have a lot across the street that is apparently free with validation.  best bet is to pull up in front in one of the empty street parking spots and go inside and ask where to move to.   Meter maids do patrol the area because of the popular Downtown Container Park right around the corner, so if you street park make sure you pay.  its only like $2-4, but the machines takes like 5 minutes per person to run a credit card.  It might be faster with coins but I haven't carried any of those in my pocket since the '90s.   TL;DR - Eat here, you'll like it. Be sure to have a cocktail.",

I definitely recommend the \"save the tuna\" sushi, I'm not sure how they got it to taste so fishy. The portions are a little small so if you like to eat a lot considering ordering more appetizers like the buffalo cauliflower wings. The night we went they were super busy and they were having trouble getting all the orders in before closing but the staff worked hard to try to get us in and we ended up being able to get a bunch of stuff to-go. We liked it so much we went back for brunch the next day. Also, like everyone who works there is super cool and attractive you'll get a crush on everyone.",

    "text": "This is SO disappointing to have to write this horrible review. We have been patrons here for over a year and the food, while usually so delicious, has had so many inconsistencies. Tonight was the last straw.   Customer Service: Usually mediocre but the food is so great that we always come back or order delivery. The hostesses love to put us on hold for long periods and then hang up when we call to place an order. The best is that they like to forget items that you paid for- calling Grubhub or Postmates to get a refund is never a fun, wasted 15 minutes of my day. Most of the time, the place seems as if its being ran by an after school, high school club.   Tonight (I'm assuming they were out of their normal cheese) they used something similar to a bad, upsetting version of a cheese substitute. Very gooey and sticky but to the point of making you want to puke.. or highly consider it. No one bothered to say that they changed the recipe in the last week or were out of the normal ingredient. Again, we order these pizzas once or twice a week. The tamales are great when they are great, but 5 times out of 8, they are dry, bland, and burned. The last and only time i've ordered the Pho, the broth was so bland. Tasted like water with floating mushrooms. The eggplant stack would be good in theory.. however the bottom and edges were burned to the point of tasting like old, burned, oil crisps. The first time I had the buffalo cauliflower wings, they were amazing! The next two times they had a weird smell and tasted like perhaps they were cooked with the same oil as the brunch items... but hours later.   The point here is that the inconsistency with the food is such a real problem. I LOVE to see vegan businesses thrive here! However, it looks like this is going to be one that loses our support. I absolutely hate yelpers that have had one bad experience (or lie) and rant just to get a free meal. I am not that person. I never give bad reviews, but I feel as we have been abused more times that necessary since we remained loyal customers despite the inconsistencies. Which is my fault I suppose for always coming back. I can only hope that they get it together before losing more business.   Order and spend your money here at your own risk. Out of every 5 visits, I can guarantee that 3 of 5 of those, probably won't taste as well as the other 2.",

I feel like I'm good at math, but given the prices on the strip I didn't question it. Next was the Save the Tuna appetizer. The portion was good for the $7 price. Well balanced flavor with appropriate fishy taste. Served with tamari sauce to make GF. We also had the tamale appetizer ($7). Tamales (2) were outstanding. Very well flavored, masa was not too heavy. Nice sauce and filling. I definitely recommend these.  My wife had the Stuffed French toast - she thought it was really good, filled with fresh fruit and \"cream cheese\". It was served with a side of fruit.  I had the Food not Bombs bowl. Very filling with potatoes, black beans and scrambled tofu. Great for a filling brunch to last to dinner.  Service was great too! Highly recommend this place!",

Our server recommended the Save the Tuna vegan sushi appetizer, and that was a good choice. It was light and refreshing, made with a flavorful rice. My boyfriend had the East West Taco made with jack fruit, which came with 3 heaping tacos. Portions are pretty generous. He loved it. I went for the Moroccan Tagine of Roasted Vegetables. It was very hearty, with quinoa, though I have to say they missed on the Moroccan flavors and the eggplant was under cooked. We shared the chocolate tacos for dessert, which was small, but just the right bite.  If you're vegetarian, vegan, gluten-sensitive, etc., you're going to love this place. If you're a meat-eater, you can still find things that you'll like. It's nice to find creative food that's healthy and well-prepared. It's also very reasonably priced. This area in the downtown has a good vibe and lots of cute, new restaurants popping up. This is one of them.",

After patiently waiting for an.hour and 15 minutes my husband went to see how soon the table was going to be ready.  The abrupt and curt hostess told him that are table \"wasn't even close to being ready\" and added another 45 minutes to our time.  It was completely apparent at that time that she was making no effort to accommodate us.  Our party split up and 3 stayed at VegeNation ( and was immediately seated) and the rest of us went to the restaurant next door.",

The chia lemonade, tamales, tofu scramble, sushi, and burrito was super delicious! It is a bit pricey and the one time we ordered a brownie during a dinner service, we thought it was a bit tiny.

Today I went in around 10:30, and the place had three or four parties, so relatively slow. I was there for over ten minutes and no one came by to drop off water or ask a drink order. There were at least three waitress that passed me. One was cleaning up for another table, another walked by me and smiled, and the third just sat at the host stand. There was also the manager and head chef, doing whatever they were doing. I've gone there enough to know who they are. There were almost more employees there than customers, and still I sat there without anyone coming by. It's hard enough to get customers to walk through the door, but to ignore them when they're at your establishment willing to purchase your goods or service is inexcusable.   I told the manager the situation and that I was leaving. He was polite and tried to make it right by offering me food on them. I decided to pass. It's unfortunate because I live less than a mile away, but this was not the first time the service has been absolutely horrendous. I'd rather give my money to businesses that pay attention to their customers.   I hope they can tighten up their services, they have a really good product.",

    "text": "This feels like that time I refused to read The Twilight series because it was about vampires.  Turns out, I should have been more open minded about vampires.  Sorry vegans, but as an avid meat eater, I judge your cuisine harshly and perhaps unfairly.  When I found myself in this cute little restaurant to accommodate a vegan friend, I was taught the error of my ways.   The menu is creative and everything I had was so delicious and filling. On the rare occasion that I've eaten a vegan meal, I end up unsatisfied and looking for a snack. Not the case at VegeNation! We started with the buffalo cauliflower. It was the perfect amount of heat and the house made dipping sauce (green goddess?) was a nice, cool accompaniment. For my lunch, I had the Downtown Tony. Three portobello mushroom sliders, and crispy tater wedges. Added bonus, it comes with house made curry ketchup and sriracha aioli.  Yeah, it was lunch. But when you've had a hard day, you go for that bread pudding at 2 pm. Unbelievably good, with fresh strawberries and a great texture.  I'm happy to say I misjudged this place by its cover. I will come back here, even when I'm not accommodating someone else. Great addition to the downtown.",

The dishes are filling and savory, you forget everything on the menu is meatless and dairy free (mind tricks)!   I've been here 3 times, extremely close to my job and always a go-to when want to treat myself. The prices aren't bad and the variety is what keeps me coming back.   The Eggplant Stacks and the Buffalo \"Chicken\" sandwich are my favs at the moment.   When it comes to customer service, the staff is extremely friendly, ready and willing to help, also another reason why I keep coming back!",

My favorites were the Holy Mole, Torre Washington Salad and Warm Apple Cobbler! I live and work right around the corner and will be back often!   Updated review 7/16 (5 stars down to 3 stars) Ordered the Out of Africa again, for some reason it did not taste the same as the first time we had it. Pretty disappointed since this is what we came back for. Let our server (Daniel I think his name was) know and he said that \"our kitchen is working on consistency.\" Didn't offer to give us something else to replace it. Kinda bummed. =(  Hoki Poki and the Out of Africa bowl are my favorites!! I've been here twice and have had great service and  delicious food both times. I wish I had one closer to me in Henderson *wink wink* I'd be there everyday. The ambiance and aesthetics inside is cool too. Someone was playing the guitar on my second visit. I love the vibe here. They are also right next to Container Park.",

    "text": "To preface: I'm a carnivore. To retort preface: I'm a fan of vegetables, they're my staple food item at home, so I'm a meat-reductionist. I love my greens and other colors.  In short, all of my pet peeves against vegan places were met here. Over-hyped by desperate veggie people, under-flavored for god knows what reasons, and uninspired menu descriptions, per usual. Fake this and fake that.  Don't call it chicken if it's not chicken.   Why do veggie places do that in the U.S.? Indian/ME/Medi veggie cuisine has been around for hundreds/thousands of years, and they don't call anything fake. I think vegan joints do this in hopes of attracting carnivores away from the dark side, as if we're too stupid or timid to try anything that isn't pretending to be a meat, but I've only found these descriptions repulsive, and I know I'm not alone in the sentiment. Are vegans attracted to meat-named dishes that aren't meat? That seems weird. Like if you have a moral objection to murder, would you be drawn to self-defense instruction that was called, \"Murder Class?\" I don't think so. I hope not.   Anyway, rating the Nation was difficult, torn between a 2 and a 3 star. If I were vegan, I'd give it a 3. People love the dickens out of this place! They rave. It's a sanctuary for them. I understand! Veggie Safe Space.  And the chef's plating is attractive, so I've had them bookmarked for awhile as there was clearly pride taken in the presentation of this unstoppable culinary trend in America that continues to suffer growing pains and engrained stigma. Visually, they're doing what they can to lure folks in to try this \"food.\"  But on my first and last visit last night (for the ThugKitchen popup), the experience was Vegan-Average. Meaning: blase flavors and some pretty amateur execution. Take for example the mac&cheese ordered and photoed. Looks nice! But the noodles were cooked beyond al dente, an inexcusable faux pas for any restaurant claiming niche fame and enjoying an average 4.5star rating. Boil water, take out on time. The \"cheese\" had little to no flavor and was masked with a spicy kick. Meh. If you can't produce a simple home comfort food, well...  Our table shared an order of buffalo cauliflower. This simple item was the best of the evening. When I asked our server about how it was prepared, she didn't know. We're talking maybe 3 ingredients. The chef had to be conferred with to confirm.  Oy. Another service note, our desserts were brought out before the main course. We were asked if this was ok. What if it wasn't, were we supposed to say \"NO! Take it BACK!?\" Felt like we were in Crazy Town for a moment. Dessert before main dish, because they couldn't handle timing in the kitchen.   About those desserts. I had the banana cream pie. The live banana on the side was about the only thing that tasted of its namesake. No memorable flavor otherwise, with the large dry pastry shell dominating the pasty-textured filling. A friend ordered the carrot cake, which tasted like someone pureed some carrots and said, \"voila!\" That ain't cake. It looked like an upturned can of cat food that dried out in the sun. Most unappealing, unpalatable dessert ever.  That about wraps it up. Sad, I won't be back. But if you're a dyed in the wool vegan, you'll love this joint.",

Industrial mixed with plants is great!! Very clean and cozy. We started with dumplings Beautiful Presentation and must eat with sauce. I like to try things alone, but with sauce WOW!! Then Bao Wow is WOW WOW I know I know SOO good!! Great mixture of Mushrooms with the tofu and again presentation awesome.   Then I had Chickn' and waffles couldn't pass it up I love the mixture of savory and sweet. There was a spicy sauce layered in with the waffles and the \"chicken\" had a light batter which makes me happy wasn't to much. There was a WHOLE potato yes. WHOLE potato cut and served with my dish crazy good. My Husband had the Mama's Red Burrito. Looked good did not try he LOVED IT!!  Finally, my son had French Toast and Orange Smoothie. He ate them both with no complaints. That is a Miracle in itself since he's a meathead!!  Haha. So yes food AMAZING!!  Now the staff.  Meh!! We had Grizellda  (I'm sure didn't spell it right). She was nice but I felt like nothing above and beyond.Just to greet us it took her at least 10 minutes. Yes I timed her. She was attending One other table Really!!  The least you can do is introduce yourself and say you'll be right with us. I understand the industry I was in food service, retail, and now beauty. I get people.  She was more concerned talking amongst the other employees than to take the time. Also, if you pass the table I'm sitting at and you stare at me maybe you should smile. ( I'm referring the the rest of the staff) It doesn't hurt. I mean I'm smiling,  it isn't hard to reciprocate. So, overall I will go back and just get the to-go or maybe try a different shift.",

I enjoyed my first meal so much I went back again on following days whilst I was in town. Will definitely be back again when next in town. Its a must visit for locals and visitors alike and it does not matter if you are vegan or not as you would never know you have no meat products in your dish. Go visit you will not be disappointed",

After being pulled in by the breakfast options we decided to order the waffles. Our server then told us breakfast wasn't being served at the time & we shouldn't have been given that menu. Seems like an opening week mistake not something that should be happening at this point.   We decided on the bao which was the best thing we tried. Highly recommend. The black bean quesadilla was tasty but not anything to write home about. The jackfruit tacos were not my cup of tea but others in my group dug them. The big haus salad was very good & filling but I could probably make something like it at home.   I don't like that they put the term meat balls on their menu. At least put it in quotes, \"meat\" balls, so people can easily understand it isn't meat nor are there meat options. Many people know everything is plant based here but perhaps those discovering this place on a whim may not.   I would still like to come back for the breakfast offerings.",

    "text": "It's nice to have a healthy, plant based restaurant option in town. Having said that, the food is just OK. Wondering why I'm still giving it 4 stars? Well, I am a vegetarian, cook 3 meals at home everyday and I frankly enjoy my food way more. But I don't want to compare it to mine, so I'm giving them a higher rating just for trying to accommodate a mass audience's palette. People expect healthy food to be bland and that's pretty much what you get. The food needs some more flavor and love.   Here's what we ordered and what I think they need help with: -Vegan Sushi- really good! no complaints -Moroccan tagine (Casablanca)- Most of my veggies, especially the eggplant and sweet potatoes were undercooked. Just a few more minutes to steam/sautee them would have been great. I am also part Moroccan and this really doesn't taste like a couscous dish in terms of spices. -Portobello sliders- To replicate a meaty burger/slider, I think they should use an entire portobello mushroom as opposed to them thinly sliced. There wasn't enough \"meat\" for the doughy bun. Needs more sauce as well.  -Starter dumplings- There's a smokey cayenne powder taste in them. Not a fan of that.  -Jamaican punch- pretty good but I think they should describe the expected flavor because not many people know what Jamaican spice tastes like.  The service was wonderful. Very attentive waiters. They were really on point.   I will go back at some point and hopefully have a TASTIER experience.  Please use this as Constructive criticism.",

My husband, who usually is only happy with a burger, LOVES the portobello sliders. We ended our meal with a brownie sundae which was awesome. Whenever we go out, the dessert is always a hit or miss at other restaurants, because the portions are always super small (like 4 bites) or way too big. The brownie sundae was perfect. We ordered two, and shared with the little ones, and went home full and happy! Best place! :)",

I have the CBD Feel Good Tea (light ginger tea with CBD oil), white wine Sangria, Chicken Pot Pie pasta dish (not really chicken if course), and the brownie Sunday (highly recommend!!! And I did not feel weighed down after). All recommended! It was cold out, so the \"Chicken\" pot pie was like a vegan form of a traditional home cooked dish. By the way, I am not a Vegan.   The only reason it loses a star is because service was a little spotty. Servers and hostess seemed to stay in the kitchen for a long time, and it took a while to order even though there were not that many people there. It should be 4.5 in my opinion, but still no half stars yet in yelp.   Most importantly, I would return again and again because it is tasty vegan food (not easy to find) and a nice break from heavy Vegas restaurant foods!

For dessert I tried baked Alaska which wasn't as good as I was hoping mostly because there was a bit too much going on with the flavors.

Then the time before last, my card got charged twice (It had been used in two different checks! Mine and someone else's). I called and they made it right, they reversed the charge and offered me a store credit for the inconvenience. When we used the store credit, I noticed that I had a balance after the credit because I had been charged for 2 desserts. I only ordered one, received one, and ate one! Now I am starting to see a pattern. Watch your credit card statement and your bill. How many people have had a padded bill and never noticed it? The straw that broke the camel's back is that my husband and I aren't the stereotypical Vegans. We are pro second amendment. We both have our CCW but my husband chooses to open carry which makes me feel safe since I as a woman have been the victim of an armed attacker and have also been the victim of sexual assault. Now mind you we have been coming here for 2 years. The owner knows us. Knows my husband carries ... When we walk in last week, the hostess looks at us turns around and brings out the owner. All he says is \"we have a sign now\" and points to a small sign placed out of the line of sight that says no weapons. No apologies or explanation. Not even the courtesy of acting professional about it and treating us as valuable customers. How many Vegans open carry.....It's not a common mix of ideologies. I feel that sign was placed there SPECIFICALLY for us! Maybe they just wanted a reason to turn us away since we caught on to their SCAM of adding items to the check and charging your card twice!",

    "text": "EVERY time my partner and I are in Las Vegas, we hop down to VegNation. This spot is amazing for vegan substitutes of your favorite comfort foods. Neatly tucked away in downtown Las Vegas, it's a short Uber or Lyft ride from the strip, or a short walk if you're staying in the Fremont area. I've done both and it worked out fabulously.  AMBIANCE is beautiful. I love the minimalist style here. The plants, real or not (lol), add a nice vibe. I love their menu- one of the most fun and colorful ones I've seen for sure. There's plenty of seating, and I believe there's a patio, although we've never sat there before.   ORDERED so much food in the past, you've just got to check out the photos. We've ordered almost everything in our trips.  FOOD is honestly hit or miss sometimes, but I enjoy the offerings. They offer lunch, dinner, and brunch options here, which is the awesome part. My top favorites are the buffalo cauliflower wings, popup chicken and waffles (brunch), and the sushi (save the tuna). I would avoid the burgers.  OVERALL a foodie four stars for VegeNation. Another trip, another visit!",

    "text": "Today was one of those days in which I decided to be adventurous and try something new. so why not vegan food? The place is beautiful! I love the design. The customer service was excellent! The waitress treated us with the utmost respect and guided us with the menu. We were there for brunch so the menu was a bit different from the one online. I had a bloody orange mimosa. The presentation of the mimosa was pretty, plus it was delicious. For appetizers, we had The little dumplings and cauliflower (bbq sauce). I ate the dumplings in less than 2 minutes they were delicious!  It's one of those plates you have to try. The cauliflower with bbq sauce was such a simple dish that I would have never imagine tasted so good. That's definitely something I want to try to cook at home. Great idea of a combination. As for our main dishes, Avocado tacos...yes avocado ! Worth it! Chicken &Waffle was another dish who left me speechless. When you go to a vegan restaurant and you order chicken obviously you know it's not going to be the chicken we all know. but trust me it's better!!! That first bite I fell in love with that plate. I would go back and order that plate in a heartbeat. Even though the plates are a little bit pricey it's worth trying. I would definitely come back. I had a great experience. My mentality of vegan food completely changed after trying it out. This place is a True gem! Thank you!",

Our waitress was exceptionally nice as well.   Food: 4.5/5 We ordered from the lunch/dinner menu. Save the tuna sushi:  Finding veggie sushi itself is an ordeal and on top of that such delicious plate definitely made my day. Buffalo Cauliflower wings:  It was a pretty tasty dish but a tad bit too sour for our flavor. Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi:  I am not a big fan of imitation meat. But this dish was super creamy and flavorful. Our waitress split the order into two plates even without asking. So thoughtful :) Brownie Sundae:  Dessert was on the house bday treat. Yayyy. The freshness from berries and coconut flakes was super. Brownie was as good as a black bean brownie could be. Ice-cream was delightful.  Happy customer :)",

I had to get some food in my stomach before finishing that thing.  We ordered the baos, I had the pho and husband ordered the Pamela Anderson. The bao was pretty decently sized and on the oily side. I thought it was pretty good, the cooked veggies and mushrooms were excellent, but it just needed an extra shot of hoisin sauce to put it over the top, and a little less oil on the tofu. The pho was strong on the mushroom broth, but needed more cilantro, star anise, and onion flavor to it. Otherwise, it was a decent noodle soup, but not pho. I wasn't a fan of the tacos, but I was a fan of the vehicle they used as the taco shell (collard green, I think?). I'm taking that idea to my home kitchen. My husband liked the flavor of the tacos, slightly reminiscent of Buffalo sauce /wings. Just slightly better food execution and I'd definitely come back.",

Short story, go here for dinner only. GF/wheat allergy, ugh. Stay away. Staff is great, love them. Brunches, the DJ is far too loud for most of the place. It's like a dance party with a dec DJ but without the fun, because you can't talk with anyone, including the waiter.   Dinner only. You've been warned.",

    "text": "Adorable vegan all plant based restaurant in downtown Las Vegas with lots of easy street parking. I come here every visit to Vegas because it is consistently good and have a variety of dishes. This time we went with the sushi roll and veggie steamed dumplings that we devoured in 30 seconds. The Pamela Anderson raw tacos are refreshing and healthy. Love the addition of nuts for texture. Our mini sliders were also good, however the multigrain bun a little dry which I didn't mind at all. What made a lasting impression for me and the 5 stars is their brownie sundae. That was amazing. They've brought in a new vendor who supplies amazing almond milk based ice cream, vanilla and chocolate that had the texture and taste of real ice cream. All the flavor and non the the guilt. Topped with chocolate and caramel drizzle, nuts and caramalized banana, this was one of my favorites all vegan dessert to date. I'm coming back just for that dessert.",

    "text": "Say it with me... Veg-E-Nation. Spelled with an \"E\" said with an \"A - sound\". The more you know, the better you Yelp.   Anyway, I'm not a big fan of vegan or vegetarian restaurants. For the most part they tend to lack in the flavor department. Walking into VegeNation, the first thing you'll notice is how totes adorbs this restaurant is; live plants everywhere, funky art, and welcoming soft-spoken servers.   I sat down and went order happy; My Little Dumplings, Mexican Hummus, The Downtown Tony, and I forget the name, but the Ravioli with green beans in a white sauce. To drink, a vodka based carrot juice cocktail.   STARTERS: The \"My Little Dumplings\" were fantastic. The not only did they have great texture, but also a surprising deep rich flavor. These are filled with shiitake mushrooms and spinach and wrapped in a chewy dumpling like dough. The sauce that accompanies this dish just enhances these little pockets of joy. The Mexican Hummus was very good too, but it was pretty much just spicy hummus. Solid starter plate.... moving on!  MAIN DISHES: The Downtown Tony is made of three veggies sliders with a mushroom taking the place of the beef patty, a great order choice for the cautious veggie food eater. My, \"beef\" with these sliders, was the dry bun and lack of sauce. The bun seemed just a tad stale, which made it tough to bite through. The menu states these come with aioli, but it was almost non-existent, which made for a dry slider. I ordered a side of house ketchup for dipping and this seemed to remedy the dryness. The mushroom inside was cooked perfect and the veggies were fresh. A fresh bun and extra sauce on this and you have one bomb beefless burger.   The Ravioli plate needed some T.L.C. - The raviolis themselves were cooked well and had great flavor, but sauce was almost flavorless. I added a little extra salt and pepper, which is huge for me, because I almost never add salt to anything. A little seasoning on this plate made the sauce ten times better. This plate is worth a try, but get salt and pepper on the side.   My carrot/ vodka cocktail was super refreshing, but could have used just a bit more punch. I like em' strong  Great option if you're looking for something both healthy and different. I give VegeNation four out of five broccoli bushels.",

    "text": "First time at VegeNation and I am a fan. Been to a few Vegan spots around the country and I am always curious on their take of the classics.  I) Food:  Went with a friend and we split 1) the Chicken and waffle sandwich and 2) french toast and 3) got the peruvian coffee. The food was better than expected and both dishes are a must try.  1)The waffle sandwich was flavorful and hearty. The textures were spot on. I must admit I'm very much a meat and veggies person and strongly texture oriented. The dish met all my expectations and I didn't miss the lack of meat. 2) The french toast was spot on as well. Crunchy outside, soft warm inside. They were vegan cream cheese filled and the perfect touch. The dish was not dry which is usually the case in vegan dishes as they don't include butter or dairy which are used to give that 'fluffy airy' texture. The dish came with syrup but I barely needed any. I preferred the taste as is and it was sufficiently sweet and I didn't need more. 3) The coffee was a pleasant surprise. French press, nothing extraordinary except that it was ginormous! The mug was larger than my head and easily served 2-3. The added touch was that the server provided fresh nut milk. The coffee black as well as with the fresh nut milk was a perfect compliment to the other dishes.  II) Service: The service was friendly, attentive yet not overbearing. She provided useful suggestions (such as the fresh nut milk) and food suggestions based on a few questions which was very nice to someone unfamiliar with the menu or options.  III) Ambiance: The decor had a bohemian modern greenhouse room vibe. Simple fixtures and seating and glasswear that felt appropriate with the concept and menu.  Overall great experience and worth making a trip out to old town las vegas for a try. Note I had gone for breakfast and can't comment on the lunch or other items but would be willing to give it another try.",

Came here today to an experience so different I could hardly believe it is the same owners. Eggplant stacks were significantly different taste from the bland cashew cream to the undercooked eggplant. So bad we packed it up to attempt to cook it at home. Then ordered the burger to share and it was so mushy it fell out of the bun. Not good. Service was slow and had to repeatedly ask for whatever we needed like water. The waiter took the eggplant off our bill which was nice although we said that was not necessary. He said a manager would stop by and none did. We had heard rumors that it had changed but couldn't believe it after such consistently great food and service. Vegenation Get it together. You have lots of competitors popping up and we miss the old you. In a town like Vegas it doesn't take long for people to quit making the trek downtown and pay for parking and hike to the restaurant for mediocre food.  We will try Eastern again to see if it is the same but won't make the trip downtown again.  Kind of sad.",

Vegenation has made be a believer that you don't need animal products just to make tasty dishes.   Save the Tuna: Vegan sushi made with forbidden rice, cucumber, bell pepper, mango, avocado, nori and sesame seeds. I couldn't believe there was no fish in this roll and you couldn't tell since all the flavors of a good sushi is there. This is my favorite item on their menu. If I were to be vegetarian, this would be the reason why. 5/5  Downtown Tony: Sliders with portobello mushroom, kale and sriracha aioli, with potato wedges on the side. Mushrooms have a beefy taste to them, in my opinion, which is why I love mushrooms. The multi-grain buns and kale add the crunch to the sliders. 5/5  East West Taco: Non-GMO homemade tortilla, jackfruit, gochijang BBQ sauce, kale, radichio nd guacamole. Jackfruit is normally yellow-orange in color and is very sweet. Theirs looks like shredded chicken...mind-blowing! 4/5  Muchas Gracias: Organic sweet potato quesadilla, black beans drizzled with chipotle crema, guacamole and salsa on the side.  The sweetness of the sweet potato, spiciness of the chipotle crema, and the richness of guacamole make layers of textures and flavors. 4/5  Chocolate Thunder: Cocao, peanut butter, banana, chia seeds and kale. I added hemp protein powder for $1. This tasted like dirt. This could have used more banana and peanut butter. I also wish it wasn't too thick and warm. It kind of reminds me of Real Results smoothie from Bronze Cafe but not a good version of it. 2/5  Ambiance and service were great. The prices are typical of vegetarian/vegan places.",

Well I've had this place bookmarked for a long while and finally had the chance to eat here today. My bf and I started with the Bao Wow which was probably the only thing that was good. We also ordered the Vegenation burger and the Russian standard. Presentation at first glance looked beautiful. But, once you start to examine everything, you can already tell it was not going to be good. First off, pasta is extremely extremely over cooked. It was mushy! It was like they used old pasta from last night. They also added waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many capers which overpowered the entire dish. That was extremely disappointing. For the burger, the patty wasn't even fully formed. Everything just fell apart. I literally had to eat my burger with a fork and knife. But It felt like I was eating old beans I didn't get any hints of mushroom or any other flavors. Everything is underseasoned and overseasoned at the same time. I don't know how that is possible. I was hoping this place would become a regular spot on my list, but unfortunately it's not going to be. This place is overhyped.",

    "text": "It's always nice going to a restaurant and ordering anything off the menu without having to worry about what might be in it! With that said, my SO and I ordered whatever we were craving. It was time to indulge!  The atmosphere of Vegenation is great. We've got the trendy, industrial interior with cute knick knacks hung on the ceiling and some green accents to remind you that you're eating plant-food. And the best part, plenty of sunshine!  As for the food, I'm going to come right out and say it: I fell in love with the bao buns! I liked them so much, we took another to-go. The sushi is refreshing and makes for a great appetizer. If I wanted, I could have eaten 4 orders worth as a meal. The mushroom pizza is a very comforting treat; my SO and I do like shredded Daiya. I realize it's a hit or miss for people, but we enjoy it as well as most other plant-based cheeses.  Lastly, do yourself a favor and get a brownie sundae. This dessert will make you all kinds of happy! It offers so many different flavors that work well together: a fudgy brownie, creamy vanilla and chocolate ice cream, crunchy walnuts (?), and fresh fruit!  Overall, VegeNation is a great place to dine for everyone! I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",

    "text": "As a non-vegan health lover myself, this place is awesome. I remember my friend took me here one morning for the first time, and I ended up going back that same night; it's THAT good. I ordered the mushroom pizza.... soooooooo good!! The vegan cheese is so delicious and creamy. The buffalo \"wings\" are cauliflower covered in a yummy buffalo sauce with amazing ranch on the side. I've also tried the Mac n cheese and that was good, too. To end your meal, I recommend their vegan ice cream sundae-it's the bomb!! You can't taste the difference between their vegan food and real comfort food. The only difference is you don't feel guilty when leaving this place. When you go to Vegenation, you don't need to sacrifice taste. As for pricing, it's definitely not cheap, but it's not crazy expensive either. I expected this with vegan food that tastes so good. It's amazing for a once-in-a-while indulgence. I really enjoy this place and I will definitely be back",

My wife had her go to favorite, the Vegenation Burger that comes with these huge fries they make there. We love Vegenation (and my wife isn't even vegan), the food, staff, music they play (although I'm more of a fan of the reggae that's usually playing when I'm there, tonight it was more on the punk side - nothing wrong with that), and overall ambience! I love seeing that Vegenation is doing well, I always see such an interesting diversity of people that also seem to love this restaurant!",

    "text": "Okay, I've been here twice now - once for lunch and once for breakfast.  First, the decor is gorgeous. I absolutely love the set up, the decorations, the plants, the tables, everything. It's beautiful in there. Next, I love that everything is local, organic, fair trade, etc. Both servers we've had have been some of the friendliest, most enthusiastic servers I've ever had. You could tell they LOVED working there and loved the food. Unfortunately, I don't remember either of their names but the service and atmosphere are absolutely five stars worth. And very clean and lots of parking.  But, most importantly, the FOOD.  So, I'll admit, the breakfast was just okay.   I had a chocolate bomb smoothie, I think that's what it's called and that was really flavorful and delicious. The french toast was just okay but didn't taste very french toasty, if that even makes sense. The bread that they used was incredible though.  I also got the tofu scramble and was a little disappointed. I thought the fennel was too strong and there wasn't that much tofu. The potatoes were good. Have no idea why the corn tortillas were there, wasn't expecting that. It also came with some fruit, so there was a lot of food and it was okay but not outstanding. My biggest complaint is really just that the tofu portion was so small and a bit flavorless because all I could taste was the fennel.  I'd still come back and try some of the other dishes. It's good, solid VEGAN breakfast food made with integrity and compassion for a reasonable price and generous portions.  Oh and the coffee was really good too! We had so many cups on the counter lol. We couldn't even finish everything and the waitress gave us to-go cups which was very nice.   Anyway, the time we came for lunch was really good.  We had sushi, the dumplings, pizza and something else but now I can't remember but this was awhile ago. Affordable, delicious, fresh and beautiful. The food is really colorful and gorgeous to eat. I wish I could say more but to be honest, I ate lunch here a few months ago and forgot but I do remember really liking everything!    Another reviewer said that this place is still learning and I'd say that's a fair review. Like I said, this is solid, good, food but it does seem like something is just a little bit off. They're new and still perfecting everything so I'm sure it'll come together better but this is a really amazing, impressive start.",

For Lunch I got the mushroom sliders and nearly died from the flavor blast! These were not your normal dry, ketchup ladled sliders that we find in most places who serve them, these were so tasty!

The taste of the food was very good, but the service was clearly sub-par, and the portions size/value ridiculously bad.   Spouse had a Burger, it was delicious and reasonable for $12.   I had the 'Power Haus\" salad. It was basically an slightly oversized side salad. Delicious, but barely sized for a starter. A bowl of little but lettuce of various kinds, a few thin slices of carrot, a few other items, you get it. Should have been listed for $5, maybe $6. Was $12. I was more hungry after eating it than before. We brought up the lack of substance to an employee, and was told we should have chosen another menu item. Well, thank you for that information.  Service was seriously lacking on attention. Water was served without straws, had to flag down a waiter to get them. Nobody refilled our glasses after we emptied them 5 minutes into the meal. Nobody paid attention, nobody in sight.  Again, the food tasted real good, but there are so many options in LV to get a solid, well crafted salad with plenty of substance in the $12 - $15 range, and receiving attentive service, so I don't see why we would return. The place looked nice, but the value and the service just isn't there. Too bad.",

    "text": "I would give this place very high reviews. Good atmosphere, good service, convenient location for tourists, friendly and knowledgeable staff, interesting menu with a lot of options for a light meal or something more filling. Portions are large so careful not to order too much. Beautiful presentation. Looking around, I could see some amazing dishes being served. The chicken wings were awesome, delicious, and super spicy. Only a few celery sticks and could have used more to cool down the heat. The blue cheese sauce could have been better too I think. My only real complaint is that everything is made with soy or nuts so if you are avoiding both, you only have 2 or 3 options although I thought the Pamela Anderson was a perfect vegan taco dish and scrumptious. The chicken pot pie was very peppery and tasty, I loved it but wished it could have been inside a pie crust.",

I would recommend for anyone that has Vegetarian to feed, and for anyone just trying to eat healthier.  I like Vegenation and I am not a Vegetarian.  My Daughter is. If she likes it, you can be sure it's good. And she can't wait till we go back.  Entrees:  We had the Out of Africa Stew and LITTLE SOUL Ravioli Black Eyed Peas & Collard Greens.  Both were Great!  The stew was just a little spicy, but not really HOT, if you are worried.  The Ravioli's disappeared like magic. Yum!  Drinks:  We had the fresh brewed Mango Iced Tea, and loved it. But it's just  Iced Tea.  Next time I want to try something a little more adventurous, like LEMONADE WITH COCONUT WATER CHIA SEEDS.  Next Visit:  PHO-KING-DELICIOUS with a GREEN MACHINE SMOOTHIE",

This was amazing.  the waffle was crispy and not to sweet and paired with the friend chick'n and a little syrup and hot sauce we were in love. * Bao-wow This steamed bun was amazing   *East West Tacos - a little diffacult to eat, but I just went for it, these had a great texture and flavor.   * My little dumpling - shitake mushroom and spinache dumpling - only complaint was there was not enough,  these were delish.",

You get this automatic care free vibe once you enter and its a great place to just hang out and grab lunch and coffee. Their menu has a range of appetizers, dinner, dessert, shakes. The best part, is as a vegan you can get whatever off the menu and not worry about the ingredients :)  Although everything about this place is awesome, the food, the vibe, the people. They do have one flaw...BUT not big enough to stop me from ever coming back. The entire staff is very friendly and welcoming, but its almost as if Vegenation is their first service job. Over the course of 5 visits, I have noticed that they aren't very attentive to the tables. I usually wait about 10 minutes for a waiter to come and ask what we would like to drink. Always have to stop a random waiter for a refill, wait another 10 minutes for the bill after asking for it. Often forget to bring what I request to the table (extra sauce or something) They are just not focused on the table, but never are they rude. I just think they lack experience. I'm not sure- but as far as food goes, this place is AWESOME.",

The ambience was really nice and there was even live acoustic music but it made it hard to talk amongst ourselves.  Anyway, no one came to take our drink order for a good 15 minutes. I was getting annoyed and was gonna walk out but I refrained from doing so bc I was with my non vegan friends and I really wanted them to try something new.  Our server finally came and apologized and took our drink/food order. I ordered the \"save the tuna\" (vegan sushi) and it was ok... I wasn't full though. I would've preferred if it had cucumber instead of mango.  Once we were done with our food, we waited 10 minutes for the chick to give us our check. Long story short, terrible service!!! She didn't even offer to refill my drink. I had to ask her and she sent someone else.",

I noticed a few tables that just needed to be cleaned.    Service was a little slow.  We were greeted by our server after a few and he seemed friendly enough.   We ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings. This I must say was amazing. Cooked perfectly , nice and crisp. The buffalo sauce had great flavor and a good kick to it. I only wish that they gave you more than a small portion cup of ranch. Tracking down the server to ask for more was not an easy task.   Moving on to the entree I was disappointed. The Russian standard was just OK. In my opinion it was bland and the braised eggplant was rubbery. It was really a let down in comparison to the appetizer.   Like I mentioned in the beginning of the review, this place has a good concept. They just need to work on the execution, and with the chef in the kitchen.  I may try it again.",

I will say this, of all the vegetarian places I have eaten since being married to my awesome wife, this place by far is the best.  Honestly, it's freakin good.  The staff is perfect, the chef is incredible. The place is cute and just makes you feel at home when your walk in.  The \"chicken\" waffle is the best waffle anything I have ever had.

Would like to point out that it is time to change utensils, because they are way over-used.  Our waitress Nicky noted our order incorrectly and brought 2 items instead of 1. Dressing was replaced without notice; it is ok, however if someone with the nut allergy will eat it , it could cause severe consequences.

Other then that this place is a great healthy alternative & for dessert the brownie sundae is amazingggg & big enough to share with friends",

The flavor is a mixture of sweet and spicy, with amazing texture.  Eggplant stacks (protein packed burger with black beans, brown rice, and mushrooms. topped with vegetable slaw and secret burger sauce! served with togarashi fries and curry ketchup (house made!), are just wonderful!!   Blueberry Cheesecake (walnut crust with blueberry compote) is a beautiful and satisfying end to the meal. Service and setting are wonderful.  We could not decide which dishes to try as the menu is very enticing. I raved and raved all day about this experience, hoping to recruit someone to bring me back here soon.  Result: Perfection!!  Do not wait to enjoy Vegenation!!",

We ordered the spicy pineapple pizza and the sweet potato and black bean quesadilla. We also had the buffalo cauliflower that was off the hook. Everything we ate was fabulous. Great flavors and good portions. I also ordered the Pomegranate Mule for a drink which was delicious and the molten lava cake. It was also gluten free and was fabulous. It came with fabulous ice cream and Carmel sauce. We might come back today for the mushroom sliders!    I cannot recommend this place enough!  Very happy with it and we will be back.",

I do appreciate their attention to this & making the adjustments so quickly. Speaks a lot of their morals. Looking forward to giving VegeNation another try :)   Just wanted to share an experience I had with a postmates order from VegeNation. I'm Not one to leave these type of reviews but....I was super excited to try the Biscuits & Gravy & was COMPLETELY let down! I got a SUPER small container of gravy that in no way was going to smother 4 large biscuits? The collard greens were in a small container as well (which was fine) they're tasted good too...I don't think the collards & gravy should've been the same portion for \"biscuits & gravy\". The one full biscuit I was able to smother was tasty and if the gravy was proportions it would be a very filling dish, the greens add a touch of freshness which is nice.",

    "text": "It breaks my little vegan heart to have to write such a terrible review of VegeNation downtown since I've loved this place from the beginning.  Overall, I get a feeling that they just don't care about this location anymore and it shows ALL over the place.  The curb appeal is completely gone. The sign over the restaurant is discolored and looks like it needs replaced and the planter boxes are completely empty.  We dined in on a Saturday night at 5:30-6:00pm and the place was dead. There were more staff than guests. Speaking of the staff, while the service was average, it seemed like more of a party for them. They would make loud jokes to each other and in general look like they were hardly working. Sitting next to the kitchen entrance, this was constant.  Let's start with the appetizer, we ordered the BaoWow bun. Two extremely dry buns that only taste like paper and mushrooms served in a plastic bowl. Yes, presentation is gone here now.  Dinner was Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi and Chicky Chicky Bang Bang. Again, both coming out on plastic plates. The gnocchi taste is still spot on and delicious and the portion was good for the price. The sandwich decent but could have been built much better as it looked like the kitchen made this in a hurry. The fries are terrible, about 1/4 of them were burnt tiny pieces that shouldn't even be on the plate.  The decor of the restaurant has definitely changed for the worse with weird wallpaper, where great local art used to hang. Water glasses at the table are miniature.   With many vegan restaurants now in Las Vegas to choose from, I don't think we will return to this one. Again, it really truly feels like this location is being very neglected for the Henderson location. And I would think they would want to continue to be the best in town with all the new competition in town.",

The hostesses and servers were all so sweet and made us feel welcomed.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and mm mm mmmm. So good! Hands down one of the best vegan gravies I've had, if not the best. The greens on the side were just ok, but I was there for the biscuits and gravy anyways soooo  My sister ordered the stuffed French toast, she loved them and I tried a bite and ya they were great I can confirm! My other sister got the crepes and oh my goodness YUM. If I come back I'm definitely ordering those. You don't see vegan crepes very often!  If you're plant based/vegan in Vegas check this spot out! If I'm in Vegas again definitely coming back to try out more!  UPDATED:  I came for lunch the following day and it was great as well! I decided to go with the chicky chicky bang bang, which was a delicious chicken sandwich. I tried some of my sister's Caesar salad which was good too. It was a good lunch but I think their breakfast items stood out more to me. Great service again! Was happy I got to try out their lunch/dinner menu before we left Vegas!",

The decor was fantastic with paintings on the walls that supported the movement of no meat and plants hanging from the ceiling that gave it a definite good vibe.  Along with that, the service was so super friendly and they LOVED what they did and it showed.  To top all of that off they had everything from Bob Marley to James Brown playing in the rafters of this place and it was amazing and just added to the vibe of the place.  I know normally when we come into a place like this, we don't indulge as much as we did but we were in Vegas and we were only here once so we went all in after we ate the delicious sushi style appetizer and buffalo cauliflower with a vegan dipping sauce.    Our meals were fantastic and fresh and delicious where even my son liked his meatless burger with macaroni and cheese on the top of the burger itself.    I even scored a little something something when I checked in through Yelp and got a free Sangria with our entree order and it really topped everything off.  (SO thanks Yelp)  You have to check this place out for the food, the people and the vibe ... you wont regret it (even if it is off the beaten path of the main Freemont area)",

    "text": "VegeNation was one of the first all vegan restaurants in the Vegas area. It's located in Fremont East. The restaurant is located in an older building, near the Container Park. Because everything here is vegan you won't have to ask about animal products in the ingredients. Things on the menu sound like they aren't, but everything is, I swear.   It opened on Fremont some years ago. It's in the Fremont East area. Tourists usually don't get this far. It's quieter than the craziness typical of the Fremont Street Experience. This does get tourists but it's very popular with locals. It has a pretty large menu for a place that's not big. They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner items. It also has a Sunday brunch. You get a free sangria when you check in. It's available with red or white wine, and  it's not overly sweet. The food is all delicious and all vegan. I like the Chicka Chicka Bang Bang. It's about $13 which is not as bad considering how filling this is. This is a vegan version of the spicy Nashville style chicken sandwich. It's topped with cole slaw and vegan mayonnaise. This comes with a side of potato wedges.   It's my favorite place to eat on Fremont. It's nice eating somewhere and not asking questions about ingredients. The food is filling even though it's all vegetables.",

Buffalo cauliflower wings: must have; just do it! Ask for the sauce on the side if you're not too much of a buffalo person or if you wanna control the flavor  Biscuits & gravy; biscuits were a bit dry but the yummy gravy topped it right off nicely. Portioning of the gravy to biscuit was done well.   Stuffed French toast; excellent, creamy part is a go, fruit was very fresh   Superfood coffee energy drink; tastes like dirt but like a good dirt you wanna keep drinking? That's the best way I'd put it! I liked it a lot actually, it has a very healthy flavor to it but it is loaded with lots of goodness so hey look at the bright side!   Stella even got some carrots for snacking!",

I was cranky and hungry lol. The waitresses were amazing and friendly to us and were very prompt as well. We had the cauliflower wings as an appetizer. I had jackfruit tacos that were savory and the portions were pretty big, big enough for this 33 week pregnant lady to have left overs! The prices were fair too. I would definitely come back again!  *********Update: I went from 4 stars to 1. The star is because it is undeniable that the food is good. We came back twice since the review and had horrible customer the letter two times. The host who sat us was rude and snooty. She brought us a vase of water without cups and literally just slammed the vase on our table without so much as a \"here's some water\". We waited 24 minutes before we were acknowledged and the only reason we were is because I asked for our order to be canceled. We never got asked if we were doing good, if we needed anything else we were just treated like nothing. We won't be coming back anymore.",

    "text": "So, I have a few older reviews that still need to be taken care of, but this Vegas trip sot immediately up on the priority list. It was one of the best food excursions we've had. Sitting slightly below Los Angeles at the moment. And we all know that's saying something. So, let's dive into the very first place we visitied.  When we arrived in Vegas, it was early morning and we wanted breakfast. Pulled up my trusty Yelp app and found VegeNation. The biscuits and gravy immediately called my name so we started heading there immediately. When we arrived, the ambiance immediately jumped out at us. Greenery, rustic vibe, the lighting, it was really intimate and inviting at the same time. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Checking in on Yelp got us free sangrias and they were delicious!  I ordered biscuits and gravy and my wife ordered the crepe and the french toast. ALL.OF.IT.WAS.AMAZING! Every bite. Just awesome. The service was the icing on the cake. If the service was icing, the food was definitely a moist, rich, decadent slice of red velvet cake. Just overall awesome. Next time in Vegas, we'll 100% be back.  Thanks for being awesome, VegeNation! But hey, what do I know? I'm just a Yelp Elite.",

Pho-King-Delicious - if you don't like flavor and need something safe. For those who are afraid of taste. My least favorite dish.  Mac N Cheese Pizza - Now we are talking. Fun combo. Unique. Worth a try! Nice mellow taste, interesting textures, good crust.   Brownie Sundae - Not much ice cream and the brownie itself was very dry.  Service: We came in 30 minutes before closing. I know, we're jerks. Server waited a long time to take our orders. She was in the kitchen most of the time. Perhaps she was setting up the dishes for the last round of patrons. Not much for pre-bussing tables here if you order appetizer and dessert. No refill on water which made it hard to enjoy the desert. Don't worry, my boyfriend tipped 25%.",

    "text": "This really pains me to write this review because I've been a fan of this place since the beginning. I may not eat here often, but I always postmate it - especially since I work close by. It's always a \"safe\" place for me to eat and there is rarely ever a mistake. Until the day I decided to go for my lunch break... 07/12/2019   Hostess was rude and barely smiled / said anything. Older blonde lady. Our server was Gianna. The most unacceptable service I've ever received. We were sat outside and waiting for a long time just to get water. People sat down after us and Gianna took their orders before us even though we were there waiting for a long time.  The heat became unbearable and we moved inside. Our food was ready and we saw the older blonde lady take it outside and we tried telling her that it was our food and we moved inside. We told her three separate times and she kept ignoring us and blowing us off even though she kept nodding her head at us. Listen to us!!!! So rude!!!  Gianna checked on our table once but it was as she was walking out to check on her table outside. So she was basically half outside and her head was inside saying \"how's everything?\" We told her we needed chipotle ranch for the avocado tacos and she never brought it to us. My bf had to get up and physically remind them. Keep in mind at this point, there were barely any people in the restaurant. We asked for togo boxes two times.   I wrote on the receipt \"horrible service.\" I still tipped her $10 off a $70 meal-  which I think was more than generous for the horrible service she gave us.  She chased me outside and apologized and the reasoning for the horrible service was that there were only two servers for the entire restaurant and they were packed.  - Yes I understand that, but I only have an hour lunch break and we were there for a ridiculous amount of almost two hours. Having low staff shouldn't be the guests' problem. And there shouldn't have even been any problems considering by the time we were eating there were hardly any people in the restaurant.  Thanks To the staff for ruining one of my favorite spots. I should probably just stick to postmates for this place.",

Kind of embarrassing. Haha. I tipped over 20% and tried to eat as fast as I could to not hold her table. Anyways, it's a lovely restaurant and the sangria was amazing but my only criticism is that, if this is the same sangria that's served for $9 then it should be a bit stronger. It just tastes like awesome juice. Besides that, I love it and the vegan Mac n cheese burger sounds lit.",

I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings to share.  Omg, it was so yummy!  I've been liking my food spicier and spicier, and this hit the spot!  The portions were good for our party of five, enough for everyone to have about 2-3 pieces.  To keep the spice kick going, I ordered the Nashville chicken.  I was disappointed.. it wasn't spicy at all!  It had a good flavor, and the texture was meat-like.  But I was missing that spice.  I wish I had the buffalo sauce from the cauliflower to drench the chicken in.  The fries it came with were overdone.  The decor of the restaurant reminded me of the places in Portland - wood, clean lines, and vibrant paintings of veggies.  Our server was fantastic!  She was very friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu.  The location is a few blocks away from Fremont Street, so it definitely a local joint.  I would like to come back here to try their breakfasts.",

    "text": "The food was delicious, creative and healthy.  ordered the veggie burger, but it wasn't that great, to be honest. It was missing something, maybe salt and spices. Two family members ordered the chicken pot pie (there was no pie, lol) and it was sort of bland. We had to add salt to our food. They also make their own ketchup, which is great; it almost tastes like tomato sauce, though. For dessert we had PB & J Sundae and it was to die for! My non-vegan family LOVED the sundae so much! The atmosphere at VegeNation is very green with plants and great messages. I felt like it was me with all the peace, healthy eating, Bernie stickers, etc. I would definitely go back there when I'm in Vegas again  and order something new!",

The salad was ok, not nearly enough arugula to match the description, the entrees were good, jackfruit too mushy but flavorful, and while the brownie sundae was delicious the cheese cake was just ok.

Got several dishes to split. The pizza was okay; some of our crust was burnt, so that wasn't that appetizing. The African stew needed a little salt to really bring out all of the flavors, and it wasn't spicy at all (which was disappointing because it was advertised as spicy). The burger was suuuuper mushy. Each time you take a bite, it would come mushing out the other side. It needed a more solid texture and toppings on the burger itself to make the overall texture of the burger not just a big blob of mush. The potato wedges that came with the burger had no flavor whatsoever, so I'm glad it came with some ketchup (but really needed more ketchup than was provided, given the lack of flavor with the burger and the potatoes).  One thing that I really liked was the decor. Nice solid wood furniture and greenery all around. It was very nice!",

Still can't figure that part out. Some good music would have really lighted up the mood. When we were finally seated, our waitress continued to greet and explain the menu. The service was great and friendly. Probably the best part of our experiance. We ordered the east west tacos, dumplings, cauliflower wings and the vegenation burger. The east west tacos were drenched in a very sweet BBQ sauce and old guacamole. The dumplings were cold and tasteless. The cauliflower wings were good a little too \"wet\" for my taste but my mother who isn't vegan liked them. My sister was really disappointed with the vegenation burger, it was dry, had very little spices/salt and the fries... were pitiful. They were raw for the most part and shriveled up, inedible. Here's to hoping someone else has a better experiance than we did.",

The lasagna -- a nightly special available during our visit -- was plenty savory with a sauce that had decent depth and ample acidity. The lone letdown was their \"Italian dumpling\" sweet potato pecan ravioli that skewed too sweet for its own good. Dishes take interesting approaches to make them vegetarian and often they succeed, but that ravioli was a miss. They even have vegetarian drinks. The lemongrass pina colada was refreshing, but was so sweet that it could have doubled as dessert.   Service was friendly and efficient, with our server taking plenty of time to describe dishes and answer questions. I'm a fan of the concept and, for the most part, the execution. They clearly fill a niche in the dining landscape and have enough items to satisfy vegetarians, carnivores and anyone in between.",

    "text": "Vegenation is a great option for Las VEGANS (get it? Ha). Coming from LA, I'm a little picky when it comes to vegan restaurants. Vegan restaurants outside of LA tend to lack in the flavor department or replace everything with soy...say no to GMOs! When I first came here, I remember the menu being very soy heavy. It seems as though they have changed their menus for the better since then. There are now plenty of soy free items with an array of flavors.   The not so good... Bao Wow: I could be bias on this one due to my distaste for soy heavy items. I ordered this on accident because the waitress recommended it, and I didn't check the menu for what was inside. I ended up taking the tofu out & just eating the bun haha.  Blueberry Cheesecake: This basically just tasted like coconut oil and nuts. Maybe it would've been better if it was colder? Maybe not.   The okay... Hot Tamale: If you're craving a tamale, I'd recommend this; however, I won't be ordering this again. Nothing made it stand out flavor wise to me.  Vegenation Burger: The potato wedges that come out with the burger are spiced very well, and the sweet ketchup compliments them well. The burger patty itself was pretty bland. It wasn't bad, just tasted like a lot of black beans mashed together...could use more seasoning. I'm not exaggerating when I say the burger fell apart after 3 bites (& my mouth isn't THAT big). The buns were already soggy when it came out as well. I don't like soggy bread, so I had to do without them. Does anyone like soggy bread? Chocolate Tacos: I already know people are going to disagree with me on this one, but honestly, these were just okay. I just had chocolate tacos from Tacos and Beer the other night that raised the bar! I know Tacos & Beer is not vegan, but it wouldn't be too difficult to replace ice cream with vegan ice cream. That's just my opinion.   The yummy in my tummy recommendations... Picante Pineapple Pizza: My meat loving boyfriend orders this every time and absolutely loves this. It tastes just like a \"regular\" pizza. I would strongly recommend this to those that are new to the vegan scene or anyone that's just craving some pizza.  Black Bean Chili Stuffed Sweet Potato: soooo yummy & full of flavor! Since it is sweet potato, it is also actually quite filling.  Save the Tuna: Not only is this sushi super colorful and pretty, it is also DELICIOUS! Hands down, this is my favorite item on their menu.  Brownie Sundae: I'm drooling thinking about this one. Just look at my picture of this brownie, topped with ice cream, topped with caramel, fruit, & nuts! It is unanimously the best dessert Vegenation currently has to offer.",

    "text": "VegeNation is a great example of a vegan restaurant that has something for everyone. Whether you are an omnivore like me or a hardcore vegan, I guarantee that you will be very satisfied with their offerings.  My (vegetarian) wife and I were here recently for Sunday brunch. It had a cool ambiance that my wife thought was more \"hipster\" than \"hippie\". Maybe she meant that it was clean? We sat at the community table which really did seem to be a community of sorts. Friends and strangers chatted amiably and listened to the talented guitarist/singer (they have live music every Sunday.)  We started with a French press of Peruvian coffee. Our very nice server told us how long it had to steep for and our brew was robust but also mellow and not bitter.  We shared Save the Tuna, which was really fresh and delicious. It didn't seem like there was any mock tuna in it, but the avocado was so tasty that nothing seemed missing. If you are like me and you do enjoy raw fish, just keep in mind that this dish is not trying to be a facsimile.  I chose Daniel Negreanu for my entree, and I'm glad that I did. This was an East Coast style Italian meatball grinder, all right. If you don't like the taste or texture of meat, don't get this because the meatballs were very realistic. Our server said that they get them from a place in the Bay Area, so I doubt that they're any brand that I've heard of. The \"parmesan\" is probably not Daiya because it tasted more cheese-like (actually, I don't think Daiya makes a parmesan product.) This is a perfect example of how vegan food can be hearty and satisfying.  In fact, I shared my sandwich with my wife and I was too full to help her with her off-menu order of chicken and waffles. The tiny taste of the chick'n (or should that be \"chickun\"?) that I got was pretty meaty, so be forewarned.  We checked in on Yelp and got the free brownie sundae. I didn't exactly save room for it, but I somehow devoured my fair share. I would love to know what kind of ice cream it was (rice cream? almond cream?) Wonderful!  VegeNation just made our list of must-visit places for every time that we come to Vegas. I think that two-for-one happy hour is calling our names!",

Not too far off Fremont, cute little hipster vegetarian/vegan joint. The staff was really friendly, even though I came close to closing time. I got the jackfruit tacos, which were pretty good but a little too leafy and fell all over the place. Would definitely come back if I found myself on Fremont and needing food in the future.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this space was the tranquility, my crew and I were in search of after a long day of Vegas tripping :). Located just off the strip, tucked in a quaint neighborhood that is taking on new life, you will find a gold mine in Vegenation! My first time here, I didn't know what to expect so I used YELP to help guide me through the decision making process. We walked in and was met with a friendly hello, music artist playing live, smoothie tasting and a serene vibe. It was just what we needed after a long hot day bouncing about. I got the mushroom, basil pizza, and my crew got the tamale, and biscuits and gravy with collard greens. We all found our food to be delicious and well seasoned. One in my group did feel the collard greens should have been a larger portion. As soon as she brought it to the attention of the server, she was immediately accommodated with a larger portion. This is the type of service one would expect at any establishment but often is not the case. Vegenation has such a beautiful energy that is felt immediately upon arrival. The experience was so lovely that I asked to speak with the manager and get contact information of the owners. Little did I know one was onsight. I got to share my appreciation of the space with him as well as his staff. Amy and Marnie are amazing servers and Jessica does an awesome job of navigating the ship in her Manager position. I really appreciate the time spent in restaurants or any company in the service industry that pays attention to creating good energy. Oh, one more thing...please make a point to see the patio area! The outdoor space was enchanting and the photo ops...are Instagram worthy for SURE!!! After eating, we spent another 20mins taking photos on the patio. Anyway, definitely stop in and eat, drinks and be merry...and share some great energy!!! Happy Eating!!!",

The Bao Wow and Mamas Tamales were unbelievably amazing. The Chocolate Thunder smoothie was super tasty, as well as Chicken n Waffles and Biscuits n Gravy. Our waitress, Chelsea was the best!!! She chose my dishes because I couldn't decide, and she was so cool the whole time and really gave us her attention and care. Wish I could go back sooner; next time you're in Vegas I 100% recommend going here.",

However, my girlfriend is vegan so from time to time, I'll be spotted in a vegan/vegetarian restaurant. My main complaint with most vegan joints is I feel like they make things too healthy and don't put a lot of flavor into things. Not the case at all with VegeNation. The jackfruit tacos were super flavorful and the cauliflower wings had a perfect balance of the 4 S' - sour, salty, sweet, and spicy. Can't wait to pay another visit soon :)",

    "text": "My wife and I were visiting from LA and heard good things about VegeNation, but were pretty disappointed in the food overall. The atmosphere is trendy and fun, and we liked the community table concept. Our server was very nice and attentive, and her service adds a star to our rating alone. We ordered the special, which was described to us as so popular, they keep bringing it back - Chicken and waffles served with fries. We also got the \"Downtown Tony\" - portabello sliders with an aioli and veggie slaw, served with some \"wok veggies\".       The dishes were well thought out for the most part, but poorly executed. The sliders were probably the best thing we had, although not terribly flavorful, and the mushroom to bun ratio was pretty low, leaving you with a lot of extra bun. The wok veggies were overcooked and oversauced, and seemed like they were cooked in too much oil at too low a temperature to get caramelized.       The chicken was a good texture, but the breading was quite bland, and was much less crispy than other vegan fried chicken we have had. In my experience, the chicken needs to be a little spicy to balance out the sweetness of the maple syrup and waffles, and these couldn't stand up to their sweet counterparts. Waffles were very good!       The \"fries\" were more like baked potato wedges, were way too thick, and ended up raw in the middle, with little to no seasoning. Severely undercooked and not crispy. Curried ketchup was strangely sweet and thin, and couldn't save the \"fries\".       We love supporting new vegan restaurants, especially in areas where the vegan pop is growing, but VegeNation needs to rethink their menu or retrain their kitchen staff to keep up with much better executed food from other places like Bronze Cafe, Komol Thai, the chicken sandwich from Flippin Burgers, and some other vegan options on the strip.",

At the Henderson location we asked to sit on the patio, and the hostess seated us inside, we had to remind her to seat us outside.  Then they brought the appetizer but we didn't have anything to eat it with, so we had to flag someone down for silverware and plates.  Also, no alcohol, but it is on the menu.  We tried the one downtown, again great food, but the service was terrible. Pinot Grigio on the menu, but they don't have it. Had to flag down people to even stop to get extra napkins.   We asked to see desert menu but we were given the check.  We got the message.  If you go, expect great food, but poor service and you won't be disappointed.",

It was delicious, but I didn't like the texture of the soup.  It was very runny, not thick.  I also tried the brownie sundae, that was a disappointment too. All in all, I don't think they offer much variety for a veggie restaurant.  You'd have to come up with a few more dishes to impress me.",

The menu is 100% plant-based, and I came here with a group of 9 non-vegans and 1 vegan, all of whom enjoyed everything we ordered. We ordered the chicken and waffles, veggie and tofu bao, buffalo cauliflower, chicky chicky bang bang, Mac daddy burger, Pamela Anderson veggie wraps, elotes tamales, pizza, cheesecake, and baked Alaska. The chicken and waffles, which are a weekend brunch special, tasted absolutely heavenly. I actually came here twice during my 3 day stay, and ordered the fall salad and eggplant stacks the second time. They were both absolutely delicious, which means that both their more \"junk food\" type dishes and their whole foods based dishes are equally delicious. The buffalo cauliflower wings are an absolute must have. The portion sizes are large and prices are reasonable, except in the case of desserts- the sizes are quite small for the price you pay.",

I ordered a \"loaded\" Bloody Mary which was $1 more for a piece of cauliflower and a jalapeno added.  Because I ordered the \"loaded\" Bloody Mary and not the basic Bloody Mary, I didn't get the 2 for 1.  They wouldn't even give me a basic Bloody Mary as the 2nd one.  Too many restaurants, especially in Vegas.  Never coming here again.",

I really enjoy the care they put into their food to offer specials throughout each season and make food that even a carnivore like me can enjoy!  I love their Bao Wow buns, the burger, their seasonal kombucha, and their chia seed lemonade!  On weekends there is a hefty brunch menu and also live music to boot!",

The first night, we received excellent service and food which lead us to return the next day. The next day, after being seated we watched hungrily as all the customers around us were checked on and waited on before us. Despite the subpar service, the food was delicious so we returned the next day only to receive even worse service as we waited patiently watching everyone around us bring served and repeatedly checked on while we hadn't even been acknowledged by our waitress. This is the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant due to poor service. This totally sucks because the food is actually delicious.",

    "text": "Yes I have seen your email but you are not fixing or helping anything because your attitude on the emails is lacking any True interest.   You think you know what you're doing but you have no idea.    Perhaps you have never had any professional dining experience.   I'd be happy to train your staff for free because Donald is so amazing but you need to be fired or smart enough to hire someone to train the staff.    There isn't one person who works there who displays any dining or serving experience.  1. Dim the lights to what is suitable for the time of day.  2. Train the waiters on how to approach a table, for instance, Stand straight up at the table. Say, \"Hi I'm Ann and I'm going to be taking care of you tonight .  Is this your first time here? We are a community based concept in that we use all local food and drink producers. blah blah whatever your spiel is.  3. May I get you started with some drinks. These are our special ones blah blah blah  4. GO GET THE DRINKS!  5. USE A TRAY TO CARRY EVERY SINGLE DRINK AND THINGS you need to bring to the table, like chopsticks, cream, teapot, soy sauce, etc.  6. When you return with the drinks, tell the guests about the menu. Give them a few more minutes to decide.  7. Take a spin through your section with your tray and take a look at every table and see if they need anything.  8. Go back to the new table and take the order and write it down. Don't memorize it unless you are very experienced.  9. Put the apps in if applicable.  10. Take a spin through your section and see if people need anything.  11. If you see what appears to be finished dishes, say \"May I take this? or May I take your plate? Don't make a big insecure fuss (Like the busboy does)  12. Bring whatever the freak any table that doesn't have their food yet needs, like chopsticks, soy sauce, sugar, ketchup, napkins, knives, whatever is necessary so that when you put food down, the customer can eat or drink it without waiting for the incompetent waiter to bring it.  13. DON'T MAKE PEOPLE WAIT TO EAT ONCE YOU'VE BROUGHT THEIR FOOD. Have everything they need already on the table.  14. Bring people apps THEN entrees.  15. Refill drinks if necessary.  16. Offer desserts.  17. Bring check.  18. Dont' make people wait to pay.  19. Take the check and run the card or bring change.  20. Say freaking thank you to them.  See Kelly, it's not that hard.  You just don't know how to do it. Read this to the staff.  Now for the busboys or girls. 1. Constantly cruise the sections and take away empty or dirty dishes. 2. Refill waters. 3. Say to people \"May I take your plate?\"  You don't have to use hand gestures and wave your hand all over the table.  Be discreet, people go out to dinner to enjoy themselves, not involve you. 4. It's not that hard.  You should have one big staff meeting and clear this up immediately upon reading this.  Hostesses: 1. Stand at the podium with a smile on your face. 2. Say hello or good morning/afternoon/evening to guests. 3. Ask how many and seat them with a smile. 4. Stay off your phone, don't smoke, and keep smiling. 5. Look people in the eye.  There you're welcome. Good luck now and stop making excuses for yourself. It's downtown Vegas, not NYC.  Here's a video of how a restaurant runs. Watch it. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5MqvhMFV7BU&s=5d911e28986ed158e1a34bf14373b2bdcc1ec2feedd360ed21e43c1db12382e4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=5Mqv...</a>",

The peanut butter banana chocolate smoothie is epic! It is so good it can be a dessert or enjoyed before the meal. As for food, I highly recommend the mushroom sliders (downtown tony), the \"chicken\" pot pie, and the bow wow. The veggie burger was kind of meh, but that is the only thing I didn't very much enjoy.   For being vegan, you don't even realize you're eating food that is plant based. The sweet potato is another quality menu item. The pizzas are light and somewhat tasty, but I would recommend you order infinity mushroom sliders. When it comes to dessert, the carrot cake and blueberry cheesecake are both delectable, but the peanut butter almond milk based ice cream is fabulous! In short, highly recommend this amazing restaurant.",

I had French toast with its special sauce. I added a little syrup and it was amazing!  It also came with fruit. We tried the super porridge, chocolate granola with chia seed pudding fruit mixture and Bullet coffee. Everything is excellent!  The service is 5+ stars hands down. We stayed at the Bellagio hotel downtown which is a 5 mile run one way but well worth it!!!  You can see the Old Vegas strip before or after you eat too. We live in Indiana and I wish we had this place in our community. We will be frequenting this place when we come back.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I am not a vegetarian.  In fact I will occasionally go a day without eating anything that would be considered a fruit or a vegetable.  However, this place was great.  My wife prefers vegetables to meat, and I have no problems eating that way.  While my frame of reference isn't incredibly broad in this regard, I loved the food and will absolutely return.  The black bean hummus appetizer was amazing - perfectly seasoned with a fire roasted jalapeno that added to the experience.  I had portobello sliders which were filling.  The sriracha aioli was really good but I could have used a little more as the whole grain rolls were quick to absorb it.  My wife enjoyed the sweet potato quesadilla (I might have snuck a piece too).  In short, everything was great.  The inside is very cool and the service was fantastic.  Don't take the 4 stars as a downgrade - it totally isn't.  There are just restaurants out there which are on a different level, but that shouldn't detract from Vegenation.  As I said, we'll go back.",

Yum! I didn't have any cash, and ladies didn't even let me get my cc charged for a dollar so I could at least tip them.

Muchas Gracias Sweet Potato Quesadilla is killer.  As are the Italian Dumplings which are sweet potato pecan ravioli in a buerre-blanc-ish sauce with asparagus and radicchio.  They serve kombucha which is not made in house but is also always tasty.  The dessert tacos are cute and tasty.  The vanilla ice cream is the best I have ever had.  Affordable and convenient kids menu too!  Most kids dishes are $3.95!! Can't beat it.     They are 100% vegan.  They support local businesses.  They get involved with the community.  They have a hip urban vibe.  Non-gmo and organic abundance.     The only reason I wouldn't give them five stars is service.  More often than not the servers seem flustered or scattered.  I work in the industry so I know how it goes but sometimes it's just like 'Really?!'.  We've had wrong food brought to us more than once, a server ran our credit card on the wrong bill the other night, had to ask for silverware after receiving our meals on multiple occasions, ask for water refills, etc...  And these incidents occur when it doesn't even appear to be busy.  But nothing ever that bad or that is anything other than an accident.  All friendly staff, some particularly knowledgable about the menu, not overpriced, and the food doesn't ever take too long.    Definitely worth going too again and again!",

The wait for a booth was about 30-45 minutes so we settled for the communal seating. Never been to a Vegan restaurant before and I was pretty blown away. Menu was unique with different choices, which ranged from pizza to pasta to burgers etc. If you handed me the menu and never told me it was a Vegan restaurant, I would not have known based on the menu choices. They had clever little spins on comfort foods such as Chicken Pot Pie and Pho. We ordered the \"My Little Dumplings\" to start. These were traditional dumplings stuffed with Shiitake mushrooms and Spinach. They came with chopsticks (nice touch) and a very delicious dipping sauce (I can't recall what was in it but it had a good balance of sweet and tanginess). For entrees, I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi and my mom ordered the Russian Standard. Both were flavorful and enough to hold us both over. The food filled us up and we regret not having room for dessert. I am gonna have to come back to try the Chocolate tacos!!",

The okra was right amount of texture, was not overcooked so wasn't slimy or soggy. The chickpeas really got all the flavours and the quinoa was soaked with right amount of sauce. Reason why we didn't give it a 5 star is because we wish the jackfruit could be a little less sweet, and maybe not broken down so much so there could be a more meaty texture to it. Also if the vegan sushi come with more seaweed and wasabi on the side that would have made it great!! We shall return again!",

We decided to order a bunch of starters to share. We went with the bao wow, Mexican hummus and hot tamale.  Bao wow-Asian bbq tofu with spinach and mushroom in a bao bun. The sauce and the bao were great. I wasn't too much of a fan cause of the mushroom they use but it was a big hit for the group.   Mexican hummus-this thing was delicious. It was a chipotle lime black bean hummus with blue corn tortilla chips. I can eat this for days. It was creamy and perfect blend together.   Hot tamale-organic masa, pumpkin green chilis, and lentils. My favorite of the day. I love tamales in general so there is no surprise, I was a big fan of this.   Muchos gracias-I decided to choose this as my entree. It was organic sweet potato quesadilla black beans and chipotle crema. This dish you really have to love sweet potato. There was tons of it. I think it would be perfect to share but not as your own dish. The quesadilla was wonderful but after two pieces, I was totally over it. Too much of one thing going on.   The group did rave about the chicken and waffle. They said the waffle was awesome. Also, everyone enjoyed the pizza too. I didn't eat those two dishes so can't write about it.   Overall, it was a great place to hit up. Super cute place next to the container park.",

    "text": "My friend and I just dined here. Having had amazing vegan food in San Diego, San Francisco, New York, and South FL, I was excited to try what seemed like an amazing vegan restaurant in Las Vegas. I don't understand all the good reviews. I don't like to leave bad reviews, but for people coming with high vegan standards, I felt compelled to.  So let's get this going. We started with the buffalo cauliflower wings, which was probably the best thing we ordered from the menu. Having said that, the cauliflower was not fried enough and cut in far too big chunks to be able to really crisp up. It was good because they drowned it in buffalo sauce, but not fried well. For anyone who needs their cruciferous veggies cooked well to digest it better, please pass on these.  I had the East West Tacos, which I was excited for, but it was not very spicy and more sweet than spicy, so flavor was very off. The jackfruit was also incredibly watery, soaking my tortilla and everything just fell apart after the first bite. I didn't finish it. The meal gave me a weird feeling in my stomach.  My friend ordered the Vegenation burger. It came with about four potato wedges. The burger was better than my taco, but the flavor was meh. Nothing to rave about. It needed more flavor. The potato wedges were kind of raw. I took a bite of one, and it kind of snapped. They were hard.  I hope maybe we came on an off day, but when seeing other lower-rated reviews, they had the same complaints as me.  I will say, however, the prices were very reasonably priced, and the service our waitress gave us was great. The decor was nice (casual/trendy), but unfortunately, I don't go out to eat at restaurants for the decor...",

    "text": "If hipster granola were a thing in Vegas, I volunteer this VegeNation for that honor. But maybe you are not into granola but love the plant-based food selections available from vegan eateries? I also nominate VegeNation for your choicest choice.  However, I only went here for breakfast!  I want to go back though, for the other meals of the day!  A laid-back activist feel to the decor permeates the empowerment you feel when you order from this menu.  From the Food not Bombs bowl to the don't eat friends artwork, it highlights the vegan movement in a non-confrontational way.  The food is good, so why wouldn't you eat here?  This place is open early on weekends for brekkie, which is always a plus.  So few places open on Saturday or Sunday before 10 am!  What happens if you want a real breakfast not just coffee?  Well, go to VegeNation.  Chik'n and Waffles?  Breakfast burrito? My favorite is that they have bowl options including bean-based, acai based, quinoa-based and chia seed pudding-based.  Awesome.  The Perky Potion brings coffee to a new level.  As for the rest of the options during other times of the day.... I can't say I tried them, but looking at the menu, I dream about their many options listed as having nuts but not gluten or just nuts or no nuts, but all vegan.  Who cares?  So amazing that they have pho, Asian tacos, gluten-free pizza, buffalo cauliflower, sushi and tamales.  I would go back here in a heartbeat.  The place is in downtown, near the Container Park area, so be wary of how many people might be there - you may need to wait. Well worth it!  Prices are fair, food is prepared quickly and freshly, and you needn't worry about whether something is or is not vegan. It is.  Have a blast- this place is deliciously invigorating and gastronomically satiating.",

I ordered a lot for one person, I had a bao wow, the dumplings and the pho king delicious, together with a green machine smoothie and they also gave me a sangria because I checked in on yelp.  Im Vietnamese so i know my ph, and the pho here is probably the best vegetarian pho I've had in my whole life. the broth is just right, very delicious.  I like that the noodle is actually not the typical rice noodle but from the Japanese yam so no bad carbs here. The bao and dumplings are also exceptional, and they got the sauces right for both.   I think it's a little pricey for what you get but I'm ok with that because the food is nice.  One more thing I wanted to comment here is the service though. Don't get me wrong, it was nice, however I felt like they were rushing me even though I saw lots of other people sitting there with the laptop doing their homework.  I was there also with my phone but I had a feeling they wanted me to leave early maybe it's just my feeling. Anyway you should definitely come here if you want tasty vegetarian food.",

First dish was \"Save the Tuna\" sushi rolls - I generally like to taste sushi first as is, without any soy sauce - this sushi tasted very good on its own, but with the soy sauce they were simply indistinguishable from the regular tuna roll. Wow.  Next were Hot Tamales, which were excellent, well resembling the non-vegan version. Our last appetizer was Buffalo Cauliflower Wings - while cauliflower doesn't fully resemble chicken wings, the buffalo sauce was spot on, cauliflower florets were crunchy, overall another delicious hit. My Chicken Pot Pie Gnocchi dish was simply outstanding - full textural   resemblance of the chicken, great flavor.  May be the biggest surprise of the dinner for me was the dessert. Bread pudding was spot on, moist and delicious, great flavor. Chocolate brownie with scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream were just a riot - delicious, creamy, smooth - it is rare to have regular ice cream that tasty at the restaurant - never mind that this was a vegan ice cream. Place is very nicely decorated and has a great ambiance. Service was most highly commendable - friendly, attentive, prompt.  Overall, an outstanding dining experience.  Vegan or not, but this restaurant is most highly recommended.",

My co-worker (who happens to be vegan) and I were over the Vegas vibes the second we pulled our Uhaul up to the Rio. The shitty recycled air, and sea of gray hair and plastic men/women quickly forced us to find some sort of personality in a city that didn't seem to have any.   We found Vegenation on Yelp, and took the 15 minute uber ride to the restaurant. I ordered the Vegenation Burger, and my coworker got the Muchas Gracias. We came back to this place every single night as the food was super good. The vibes were also on point, with some good music and stellar service from a fun young group.   On our third or fourth time coming in after the convention, the owner stopped by and said hello to us. He asked us what we were in town for, and shot the shit before going back to work. It was a really nice change of pace.   I can't recommend VegeNation enough. Really great place to escape the Vegas feel.",

First, the hoki poki. Beets hit the spot on a hot afternoon. I could live without the Sriracha chips, though they made a nice crunchy touch. The beets were seasoned well and the rice was refreshing. This is a bigger bowl than photos make it seem, so it's best to order this if you're hungry or sharing. Second, I got the faux fish tacos. They had that nice deep fried flavor, though slightly dry.  The service was very friendly, helped me pick what and how much to eat, was kind enough to keep me well hydrated on the unseasonably warm day (I had a zillion refills) and did everything with a smile.

We started by ordering the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings and the Hot Tamale they were both very delicious but you guys have to try the Hot Tamale is amazing. Next I ordered the Picante Pizza it was very good but I don't think it was spicy, my cousin ordered the Daniel Negreanu it's a meatball sandwich that was very delicious you couldn't tell it was vegan. Finally we decided to try some dessert and we went for the Brownie Sundae it was very very delicious and after we were done Kimberly told us the brownie was made of black beans!",

Such a cute quirky place lots to look at in there. If you visit I recommend sitting in the back outside.   On to the food. I got the Jamaican hibiscus tea which is amazing! Tastes kind of like Christmas flavors and it's refillable! Also tried the lemonade with coconut water and chia seeds. Also good but the hibiscus was better in my opinion. I got the buffalo cauliflower app it was good but kind of small. The entrees made up for that though! I got the eggplant stack which was amazing! Also tried the Russian pasta (forgot the actual name but you'll know what I'm talking about). Both were so delicious and filling. Also really healthy. Some vegan food isn't the best for you because it's more processed or fried. When they try to make meat imitations instead of alternatives it tends to be less healthy. Anyways this place is healthy and delicious and the price is proportional to how vegan food should be (about $12 an entree)",

    "text": "Hip/casual lunch spot in Downtown Las Vegas. They claim to offer global, plant-based menu. I have never been to a vegan or vegetarian restaurant so it was interesting for me to see the options they had. Located next to Glutton and fairly easy to find.  Walking in, we were greeted and promptly seated by a friendly staff. I love the interior because it went well with the concept. Lots of living plant which added to the clean and refreshing vibe.  Keep in mind, I am not a vegan or vegetarian by any means so based on my diet and the things I eat on a daily basis, everything here tasted bland. I don't know if the fact that I am not a vegan/vegetarian plays a role in this but just wanted to quickly mention.   Save the tuna ($6.95): One of the appetizer. My favorite dish out of everything. It's a vegan sushi with avocado and mango (?). Texture was similar to tuna and it was presented beautifully. Highly recommend. 5/5  Mushroom madness/picante pineapple ($10.95): They have three different pizza options and you can get half and half which is what we did. Unfortunately I did not try picante pineapple because of jalapenos and I can't handle any heat. Mushroom madness is assorted mushrooms with herbs. It was on a thin crust and I definitely did not like the tomato sauce they used. It had a weird sweetness/tanginess to it. 3/5  Chicken pot pie: Not the pot pie I expected. There was no crust or pastry bowl, it was just a chicken stew. It had a light curry flavor but overall tasted bland. For some reason stew felt grainy and I was not a fan of its flavor nor the texture. 2/5  One of those first and last visit. Nothing memorable about the visit except for their hip and cool ambiance. I don't think I will be back.",

I was about to sit at a table while I waited and was quickly ushered to the middle of the restaurant and told I had to stand there and wait. I left and came back because I felt humiliated. One waitress with a buzzed haircut acknowledged that I was getting food to go and refused to offer me water...she even said \"oh you're getting food to go...you don't need a water glass\". So I asked the girl who took my to-go order for water and they refuse to offer straws (do they realize that when I throw the water cup in the garbage that causes so much more waste than a small straw?).  On to the food - we got tofu scrambled and the burger. My husband liked the burger and fries. The tofu scramble was bland, had undercooked onions (yuck!), and the potatoes looked like refried beans. Very unappealing. The tortillas that came with it were hard and heavy. My kids did not like the food and I found the potatoes to be so garlicky that it upset my stomach. With all the amazing vegan food in town, I would suggest staying far away from this place - I will.",

    "text": "My boyfriend wished to pen a review, here's his two cents:  My girlfriend and I have been here four times,  plus once for a carry-out order tonight.   Our experience tonight has forced me to gather my experiences and write a review.  My girlfriend is vegan,  I am not. It was her desire to try this new Vegan place in a city with few satisfying vegan dining options.      Our biggest problem with this place is that it seems like it's run by someone who doesn't know exactly what they're doing.  One time we went, all three of our food choices were sold out. Not a big deal, but still off-putting. Another night, one of the two beer choices was sold out. The only other option was an IPA, and I know it's a craze lately but there are people who dont prefer an IPA. Another time they ran out of the big glasses so I had two sips of my tiny glass of iced tea and it had to be refilled.  Really, out of large drinking glasses? I'd personally love it if they could offer more beverage options- Perhaps a cola? I can go to the grocery store and purchase several well-made and delicious natural cola beverages that would fit into VegeNation's model of natural and organic vegan food.  If it's an issue with sugar, fortunately enough I know of at least one cola sweetened with agave. The server forgot my girlfriend's drink order the same night as the \"tiny glass incident\".  Mistakes happen, and she made it right but there are so many little things with this place that make you wonder if the staff is trained or experienced in food service. It just leaves you with an odd feeling of discomfort when you're coming out for a nice meal and service.   The service is largely good. Like some others have mentioned, it's just odd how there is insecurity over whether the busboy wants to take my empty plate. Training issue or experience, or both? Change this and I think there's a very good thing going on at VegeNation.  We've been served by several different employees and Erin seems to be one of the strongest. She made right on a mistake she made the one night but she seems to know what she's doing more so than some of the others.   The food at VegeNation is hit an miss.  My girlfriend wants so badly to LOVE this place.  But it seems like every time we go there there's just one nagging little thing that prevents it from being a great experience.  Overall the food is very nice. It's put together well and presented nicely, but it's terribly inconsistent. The sushi is excellent, we've had it once.  I loved it. The pizza was good, the crust was really good for some reason. We've had the bow wow appetiser twice and tonight it just seemed like the sauce was non-existent and the tofu not marinated.  My girlfriend was let down based on the same food being so excellent the last time we went there. I've had the meatball grinder three times and it is very consistently delicious- And I'm NOT vegan! Tonight, however, I got home to see that I had been given mostly raw potatoes for fries...    Overall, I DO like this place. I, as a non-vegan, have been surprisingly impressed with the food at VegeNation. I just feel there are some big bugs to still work out and inconsistencies to smooth out. Every time I go there I hope the experience is flawless, but sadly there is always something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth to oppose the delicious food.",

My sister and I dropped by for dinner last night and I can't stop thinking about it! Not only is the menu awesome with witty names that my brain appreciates, the tastes and flavors pleased my stomach and mouth too! I am vegetarian but open-minded omnivores should have no problem enjoying something delicious here. We can all appreciate VegeNation's commitment to sourcing locally and sustainably. Top that all off with awesome service - the hostess and our server were delightful and very skilled! I'm in love with you VegeNation! I will definitely be back next time I'm in town and I may just drive the 6 hours to visit you... Thank you!",

Service is occasionally on the slow side but over all the good is so great that it's worth the wait. I also love coming Monday wen they have their special menu items and a band playing. Very fun. Also during the week before 5 parking is free on 6th street and after 5 and on the weekends they'll take $2 off ur order so I'm essence parking is free then as well. The ambiance is great and seating is very comfortable and the nose level is tolerable. Try it out. I think you'll love it!!!!!!!",

After the host offered and gives my husband the tea she then proceeds to tell him it'll be about $10.00 for the tea. I'm sorry but that's not customer service at all. That's a sleazy sales tactic that should NOT be tolerated. After telling this conniving hostess that he thought the drink was free for the inconvenience all she could say was \"oh well I'll have to get a manager\". My husband picked this food up on his lunch hour and had no more time to waste (after getting the round about from the host and a waitress on where to even place the take out order to begin with) so paid her for the tea and left. You guys really run a business like this? Won't be recommending or returning unless this is resolved.",

This location is on Carson and 7th st so if you don't find a meter right out front you may have to pay to park across the street and walk on over.  If you're new to this place I highly recommend trying the pizza out! If you don't mind spicy food try the picante pineapple, it has yummy vegan susauge, jalapenos and pineapple my new fav here!

The only thing better than good food at a restaurant is a great friendly staff and the have one.   Everyone was super cool and attentive.    If I saw one thing that they could improve on it would only be to clean up the back patio....which by the way has super cool art on the walls.  Love this place.  Looking forward to coming back.",

I dare you to tell me the difference between that a hamburger other than the fact that only plants were murdered to make it and it's not dripping with fat.

They looked wonderful next to my tomato basil pizza (I brought my own store bought SoDelicious cheeze shreds as I do not like Daiya and it gives me hives) and the spicy buffalo cauliflower which is in my top 2 for all of Las Vegas (& better than most in AZ)! Fast Friendly service and a comfortable enviornment. They will take $2 off your bill when you show them your parking meter ticket. Be sure to pin where you're from on their board, especially if you're from Phoenix area so they will build here :-)",

We love the patio, parking is easy, and we never feel crowded or rushed.    We started with Hot Tamale (Organic Masa, Pumpkin Green chilis and Lentils) which were creamy/firm in texture and spicy in flavor.  All of us enjoyed them.  Next were two pizza's  Mushroom Madness (Assorted Mushrooms & Herbs) and Picante Pineapple (Charred Pineapples & Jalapenos) and two orders of Ellen Degeneres (Raw Power Tacos Collard Green Wraps).  We ate \"family style\" trying everything and conclusively agreed everything was delicious.    Mushroom Madness:  Very mushroomy flavor, the cheese-no-cheese looks and taste like cheese.  The tomato sauce is where most of the flavor seems to explode from.  A nice, balanced flavored pizza that I would order again.  Picante Pinapple: Wow, the spice here has a kick.  It may have been a bit much for me as I couldn't taste anything else in here.  I would order it again because I'm intrigued by spicy foods.  Ellen Degeneres Taco: My favorite.  I'm always full after this plate but I'm getting better at leaving one for later so I can have room for desert!  Carrot Cake  (Raw Cashew Lemon Frosting)- Someone once made this for my birthday cake and I've wanted more ever since.   For the work involved in doing this recipe at home, $7 is a bargain to come here and enjoy it.  I'll order this again and again!  Blueberry Cheese Cake (Walnut Crust, Organic Blueberries)- Nothing bad about this choice.  The blueberry reduction on top probably carried the whole desert more than the rest as stand alone.  I would order again, but only as a second to the carrot cake.",

I would definitely get that again, even to go, on my way to work or an afternoon treat. The sushi roll was okay but not as much flavor as the dumplings and buns, probably has to do with sauce that comes with the dumplings. Pizza was different, good but the cheese has a pasty texture that sticks to the roof of your mouth and takes a minute to get rid of.    Nice to have this option available to us downtown.

The women sitting us even let us know it might take a minute, totally understandable. It wasn't until 6 people that got seated after us had waters and had already ordered their food until we got remotely greeted by a server. 10 mins into us being seated.   I don't even know the waitresses name and we only saw her a total 3 times for the entire hour and 15 mins we were there. After she brought us waters she never checked on us again until our food came literally 25 MINUTES AFTER we ordered it. Half the restaurant was empty by that time. Didn't even bother asking if we needed refills or apologize for the wait. We even checked in and asked for our free sundaes and only brought us one. The only time we got our drinks refilled was when we were on desert which was by a busser I'm assuming, so we went the entire meal without water because she never cared to come check.  We got the check at the same time since we were already there over an hour and didn't want to wait to find her again.   It was the worst service I've ever had which sucks because we do love coming there, my friends and I. Service is a huge part of making a restaurant survive and acknowledgment or an apology would have been great. I didn't even bother tipping because that's how horrible this service was.  A word to the wise, a server makes their money on tips. If you don't bother to check on your tables the entire night, don't expect a dime for giving shitty service.",

I had a late lunch and thought I would get something small or just have leftovers. But it was all too good not to eat and luckily I didn't overstuff myself. Don't get me wrong, I was given a good amount. It just wasn't filled with heavy, greasy food.   I started with the pot stickers. Such a good sauce to accompany it. For my meal, I had the portabella sliders. I can't describe the marinade for the mushroom but it all went together well.   Love eating healthy, you can eat a bunch of super yummy food and not feel like a pig!   The only downside is that I'm clear across town and am not in this neighborhood much. Guess I'll have to start making special trips because they are worth it.  Thanks Vegenation!",

    "text": "The food is amazing here...  wish that the food Could be rated separately from the service that we had. In my opinion the food is five stars they have a very creative menu with lots of different options. We enjoyed all of the food we ordered .  The buffalo cauliflower is absolutely awesome! We walked in about 15 minutes before closing. We stood at the door for the first 12 minutes and had 3 ( literally) employees with veg Nations shirts walk past us. None of them said anything... Not hi, hello, we will be with you in a moment. Two of them actually looked down at the ground instead of acknowledging the  customers( there were five of us standing at the front entry). Finally my husband mentioned to me it seems like we're invisible or something .  Just after he said something a gentleman in plain clothes \"oh I can help you?\" . He happened to be the owner and was very nice. He mentioned that he thought we had just stood up  from a table that was unbothered or .  I can understand how if he was in the back hewould have thought this . He sat us in the area that we wanted and let us know that he would get our waiter for us.? The owner left shortly after seating us. I was very surprised when the waitress (Faith) that came over was the same waitress that had walked past us several times without saying hello.? The service never got better.  At one point the server actually brought  food to the table with out silverware  my husband asking for silverware.  As she turned away she did not acknowledge his request. Since it seems pretty clear to me that she must not have heard him  due to her lack of response  I grab silverware off a table that was right behind us .  She actually Came back about 4 minutes later without silverware asking if we still needed any... I'm not really sure why if a waitress heard customers ask for silverware they wouldn't acknowledge or grab the closest sets of silverware. I understand that this was the end of the night and it did  seem like they were busy shortly before. As a past Yelp Advertiser and local  business ownerer it really takes a lot for me to write a negative review because I understand first-hand how great of an effect it can have on the company .  I was really surprised when looking at the reviews  that the business has not gone on  here and replied to the reviews  or seem to make any changes in the last couple weeks with several other to start reviews due to service . I really did love all the food that we had and it came out  very quickly from the kitchen . I feel like this place has a lot of potential an amazing menu and the ambience is wonderful as well. I hope that this business steps up their game tenfold with their service. and that next time I eat there (which I plan to again) I  can update this review to a 5 star review :-).",

Was in Vegas for a week and I was working from my hotel room so I looked for a vegan restaurant that would deliver. I happened upon VegeNation and ordered a Negrano (a meatball sub named for the poker player). It was so good that I had to call the restaurant and confirm that it was indeed vegan (and not vegetarian).  It honestly tasted like real cheese! The next day I ventured to the actual restaurant for lunch and had the chicken pot pie. It was better than any real chicken pot pie I had ever had. They nailed both the taste and the texture of the food. I ended up eating here every day for the remainder of my trip. Weekend brunch features outstanding chicken and waffles. One day I had an eggplant lasagna. I tried the pot sticker appetizer. A few of the deserts. EVERYTHING was fantastic. If I could rate this 10 stars I would. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I wish they would open a location in Los Angeles. I'd definitely be a regular.",

That was my favorite. As was the dumplings, but seriously, I'd rather have a vegan salad. No point in coming here other than it was close to Fremont street and they have vegetables.",

So I'm finally free to make a review.  The food is actually not bad. Tried the sushi, sliders, meatballs, quesadilla, fruit loop salad.  I'm going to honest.  The food is good but the names of the dishes are horribly misleading.    The sushi was good but it tastes like a Korean BimBap(GimBap). So that's what the should call it.  The mucho Garcia quesadilla tastes like bean burrito. So that's what they should call it.  The meatballs taste like arancini, but I like it.  The sliders taste like well not sliders. Can't think of a name but it's was good.  I just don't like misleading names.  Our server was Jose. He was real nice and recommended good IPAs.   Yeah so if you want a healthier option go here, but don't trust the names.",

We were seated promptly; the decor & ambiance was nice, calm, clean and casual.  The staff were all kind, especially our waitress, nothing beats a waitress that is knowledgeable and informative when asking questions about the menu. If you have an allergy let them know, they will kindly suggest replacing ingredients! Water was refilled constantly, thats a sign of great attentive customer service!  We ordered a couple dishes to try out, since we already have eaten before coming. The three   dishes we ordered were: \"Bao Wow\"~ Asian BBQ tofu spinach mushroom in a bao bun. (which I didn't try, but my sister loves it!). \"Hot Tamale\"~ organic masa, pumpkin green chilis and lentils (so good & not spicy! I love soft masa, well-made!). \"Muchos Gracias\"~ organic sweet potato quesadilla black beans, chipotle crema (My favorite!! The flavor was unbelievable, and the ingredients went surprisingly well together!) restaurants should have this in SoCal.   We waited a while for our food to come out, but the waitress did warn us the food takes time to prep. That means fresh quality food, done right!! So bummed that we didn't get to try the desserts here since we were so full.  Next time for sure!! Can't wait to be back and try all the other entrees!",

As a  completely vegan eatery it was totally delicious. Even my very carnivorous husband loved the tacos. He ordered the eggplant stacks which were pretty good, too. I would definitely come back.

Sushi was colorful, beautifully presented and pretty good. The meatball sub was pretty good as was the sweet potato quesadilla.  The smoothies were well received. The lemonade had chia in it, which one of the kids didn't care for.   We sat at the community table which was cool. The atmosphere is great. They had live music during our Sunday afternoon visit. Music was good & not too loud to enjoy conversation.   Glad we found it, best meal we've had thus far in Vegas.  We'll be back on our next trip.",

Not to mention, the coffee is outstanding.  The food here is so good, you don't have to be vegan to enjoy it. I had my birthday lunch here with all of my coworkers, many of whom are meat and potatoes type guys. Everyone enjoyed their meals thoroughly.

We've been several times, and each time, the experience has all been the same.   We are always quickly seated, even on busy nights when you think you'd be waiting for at least 10-15 minutes. Once we are seated, our waitress/waiter quickly approaches, handing us menus and asking what we'd like to drink.  This is truly my only complaint. Every time we've ordered drinks, and only drinks. I'm not even talking alcoholic drinks, just regular ole iced tea and water, it takes 10 minutes. I'm not too sure why...but it's happened every single time.  Other than that, the staff is extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming.   Now for the best part. THE FOOOOOD :D :D  The food is literally to die for. As stated in previous comments, being a vegan can sometimes be limited when dining out in the city of sin.  However, this place really makes the whole being vegan and eating out experience wonderful.   I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who just wants to try something other than Applebee's baby back ribs, burgers, and plain ole chicken salads. They definitely challenge the typical norm for American dining. 10 out of 10, would recommend.",

I dragged my carnivore eating husband and daughter with me and they loved their meals. The tacos were to die for if you like spicy and the steamed dumplings were my husband's favorite. I ate the vegan burger which was super tasty. My daughter was shocked to discover the vegan ice cream. Basically the best clean plant based food in Las Vegas, this joint should be top of your list!",

Even if you're not vegan, try this place out.. you'd be very surprised!",

My husband who is not a vegan also enjoyed the meal.  Will be back for sure on my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "If I could give 10 stars, I would.  This is the kind of place you can take meat eaters and hardcore vegans alike, the food is SO incredibly delicious and well prepared and sophisticated that it makes a fun lunch date or even a fancy gourmet dinner.  What you really want to know, is what I recommend from the menu.  From what I've tasted, here are my top picks.  1) Asian BBQ Tofu Bao Buns.  Absolutely delicious, savory, saucy, little zing to them, 100% amazing.  They will get inhaled within seconds.  Comes with two nicely-sized buns, so it's easy to share for 2 people.  2) Portabello mushroom sliders (called the \"Downtown Tony\").  These are to DIE FOR.  Please order this if you like sandwiches/sliders/tasty, saucy and slightly spicy food.  3) THE BROWNIE SUNDAE. It's gluten free.  It's gooey and soft (how they do this, I have no idea).  It's massive with two big scoops of amazing vegan ice cream, caramelized banana, sliced fruits, heaven.  If you come here and you don't order this for dessert, you are seriously missing out on a big part of life.  No excuses, you have to get this!  Everything else looks great, I just haven't had a chance to order it yet and probably won't since the two items listed above are so freaking good I will likely never order anything else.  Oh also, prices are extremely reasonable (like $10 for a delicious, gourmet, large dinner entree), staff is incredibly friendly, their T-shirts are amazing, service was great, atmosphere and decor was very LA-esque (in a good way) and parking on the street was simple.  We will be back many, many times.  Thank God for Vegas Vegans taking the plunge into opening vegan-only restaurants.  We THANK YOU for this and also for putting incredibly talented gourmet chefs in the kitchen for our dining experience.",

    "text": "This review is very challenging for me, because I'm vegan and I REALLY want to like this place. Las Vegas is a very vegan friendly city, but when it comes to entirely vegan restaurants, we really miss the mark. I feel like there's this notion in the vegan community that we're not allowed to criticize other vegans. Due to this, we accept mediocrity and praise it unjustly. So this is an honest review from one vegan to the community, pleading that our vegan restaurants need to do much, much better.   Vegenation is always a hit or miss for me, and I've been here about 5-6 times. The \"miss\" items are completely inedible, and the \"hit\" items are just okay. I find this to be really troubling, because I feel like whoever the chef is just doesn't care about the food they're presenting. The food is so bland and uninspired. It's really depressing because vegan food doesn't have to be that way! There's so much you can do with it. I refuse to believe that this chef is putting forth 100% of their efforts on anything they're creating.   I am baffled that Vegenation has the audacity to buy pre-made, frozen mock meat and serve it to their guests at the prices they charge. I understand omnivore restaurants using Gardein or Beyond Meat, because I don't expect them to know how to make seitan. But vegenation is an all plant based restaurant! Why are they cutting corners like this and not making their own mock meat? Making your own lentil \"beef\" or homemade seitan is so easy and incredibly inexpensive. Omnivore restaurants spend so much time marinating, prepping, tenderizing, etc. their real meat for their dishes. What is vegenation doing with all that extra time they have in the kitchen? They don't have to worry about serving real meat. They're not making their own mock meat. Are they spending all that time cutting up vegetables and making sauces? It just doesn't make any sense to me. Their dishes are all glorified frozen food.   Now this is where I get nit picky about specific dishes I've tried. The cauliflower wings are horrible. Cauliflower wings should be completely cooked and soft so that it is stringy like.... chicken! (shocker) Vegenation does what so many other restaurants do when they jump on the cauliflower bandwagon. They don't understand how to properly cook it, and then it tastes like crunchy, raw cauliflower covered in buffalo sauce. Maybe some people like that, but I don't understand how that's appealing at all. The meatball sandwich uses pre-made, frozen vegan meatballs. So the sauce and cheese will burn your mouth off, while the meatballs are lukewarm. PLEASE make some dang lentil meatballs already! The chicken pot pie gnocchi is essentially the same. It's flavorless, with frozen, pre-made mock chicken and pre-made gnocchi. So they cut the vegetables for you and maybe make the sauce in house. I just don't think that should be a good enough standard for any restaurant. I could go on and on about their other dishes, but you get the idea.   Vegenation, PLEASE set your standards higher. Las Vegas desperately needs better plant based restaurants. There is so much potential here. I will always continue to support vegan businesses and check up on this one regularly to see if things improve. But from one vegan to another, we need to encourage a better standard in our community for the people of Las Vegas.",

Do not know what the host name was but just because of his service I will no longer give my money nor time.",

This is like when I was dating a guy who came over with groceries to make me dinner.  But at the first bite I wanted to kick him out when he sat there so proud thinking he was definitely getting some.   Tim if you are reading this, this is not about you.  Even though you were the only guy who ever came over and cooked.  The food is AWFUL.  Please don't eat here.  Ok, I lied about Tim (it was him), but I'm not lying about the food.  The people working there looked so proud about this crappy food.  SERVICE:  Excellent.  FOOD:  vomit inducing.",

The servers were awesome when it came to substituting things for check-in offers (ex: when I was working one day and didn't want to booze it up on the clock -they exchanged a sangria for a virgin pina colada at no charge!) and they were always prompt and courteous and really cared about what they did.   Tip- if you miss chicken pot pies after converting to a plant-based diet, try the gnocchi version they offer. I'm salivating as I reminisce.../sigh",

    "text": "Appreciate that this place is available but not excited to come back again.   We got here on a Sunday during Memorial Day weekend at 7pm. Staff looked really busy, not sure if they were an employee short, and there were a good amount of tables available. It took us a second to get seated because the hostess was busy in the back grabbing and packing to go orders. There were a couple people waiting around for their to go orders. Seems to go orders are more popular than sit down. A waiter came out and said the hostess would be right with us.   We sat down and was greeted by waiter fairly quickly but he had a good amount of tables to serve as well so ordering took a little while unless he was giving us extra time since there were the five of us. It was disappointing because everything we wanted to order, they ran out of. They ran out of all red pasta sauce and after ordering they can out of the taco shells. This tells me that nothing is made fresh but rather preprepped and warmed up and difficult to substitute because it's already pre-made. But this also tells me those dishes are probably really popular and yummy because the were sold out by 7! I really wanted to impress my omnivore friends but they looked really dissatisfied with every bite they took so we felt it would be best to take care of their meal. We ordered a variety of dishes which came out to over $100. Some dishes we got may have had some good flavor but nothing \"to die for\" and nothing terrible dissatisfying. I would give this place a try if you're vegan and or gluten free and are in the area. Unless your stomach is sensitive. All five of us were gassy after our meals. Not sure if the food is old or if the black beans weren't soaked long enough or what. I personally wouldn't come back. Sorry to say. I don't regret trying it though. They have great looking dishes, cute vibe, good drinks, and great concepts but I just didn't like that all of us ended up with mild to severe gas afterwards.",

Fresh and much locally sourced ingredients, I was impressed by the inventive uses of plants posing as meat. I am a meat eater, I guess you'd say Paleo pescatarian mostly (although I occasionally eat poultry and eggs), no or very rarely dairy, no pork or beef at all. However, plants encompass most of my meals or I should say the larger percentage of my meals are plant-based, and I find the importance of eating at least five servings or more of plants a day to be vital to our health. I'm enjoying this sort of revolution towards healthier eating and reduction of processed or filler foods.  The live plant wall with hanging Tibetan prayer flags overhead, loads of tables and one large community table lends a relaxed and inviting environment.  Our server was really friendly, very sweet. She even wrote down the cookbooks the head chef likes for my daughter who is always wanting to try more vegan and vegetarian recipes. Bill, minus tip, for 3 plates and two drinks was $36.  Will be returning to Vegenation soon; service, portion size, atmosphere and quality is top notch.",

Creative, but not the output was not the most exciting.  Food: We had the Orange Cauliflower starter (buffalo sauce based) - not very creative, but the combination of the cauliflower and buffalo sauce was delicious.  We then also had Eggplant Lasagna: Absolutely brilliant execution. Creative and superbly executed. Was very good tasting and cooked really well. Haphazardly cooked eggplant can be pretty annoying. This wasn't so.  We also had an okra stew - creative, but the output wasn't the most exciting.   We ran out of space (in the tummy) for dessert, but they seemed pretty interesting too.

Both visits we decided to do take out because we just wanted to relax in our hotel (it was literally less than a mile from where we were staying)  My first visit I ordered the bao buns and the chicken pot pie gnocchi. They were both fairly delicious! I didn't get to finish my gnocchi tho because my hotel room didn't have a refrigerator :( lol   My second visit was a let down. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings, the hot tamales, and the Daniel Negreanu. My partner ordered the spicy picante pineapple pizza and the east west tacos.  The cauliflower wings weren't bad but the hot tamale was a super disappointment tho considering how they were voted the best in Las Vegas. They were extremely dry and had very little filling.  The Daniel Negreanu (which is meatball sub) wasn't bad but the fries were stale and they only gave me like three fries? Lol so I guess if you order something to go make sure it doesn't come with fries  My partner's spicy picante pizza was good! Only complaint was that it was pretty small even for a personal size pizza. The east west tacos however weren't good. The sauce was extremely sweet and the tortillas were breaking apart when we tried to eat them :/   All in all, it isn't a bad place. It has a nice atmosphere and the staff is so friendly! Unfortunately the menu for us was a hit or miss so we're not sure we might come back next time we're in Vegas",

    "text": "Trendy vegan place in downtown LV.  Beverage.  My orange smoothy was a great aparatif and dessert. Added their protein boost.  Appetizer: not so tuna sushi. Very tasty using the wild purple rice. Placed over a white sauce with toasted sesame. The dumplings are tasty, however the skin they used is a little on the harder side. The cauliflower buffalo wings are excellent!   Entrees: I ordered the east west tacos. Jackfruit tacos with Korean chili paste sauce. Interesting fruity tasting taco. Not sure it's my cup of tea. If it had a tofu and jackfruit protein instead of bean and jackfruit will be good.  I enjoyed the curries red beans and quinoa. They used a coconut based curry.  I do wish the quinoa was a little more less cooked so it will have a nutty texture  One ordered the mama Mia pasta. Tasty sauce the meat ball tastes really meaty. Another person ordered the same thing but with their noodles was substituted with miracle noodle. The noodle resembles clear ramen noodles. One ordered the pizza and another the \"chicken\"and waffles  which is delicious. Crisp! Overall good place for vegan. Okay flavor profile.  Check in and get a free sangria!",

Both delicious and plenty for two. Entrees were chicken pot pie and the Mac daddy burger.  Our server was attentive and helpful. If you haven't been...GO!  This is the #1 vegan spot in Vegas.",

When we arrived we were told there was a wait, but our wait ended up being only half the original estimate, which was appreciated.   We tried the Bao Wow, portabella sliders, and jackfruit tacos. All were great, though the tacos were a bit in the spicy side for me. I still enjoyed them. I had the Jamaican hibiscus punch to drink, which caught me off guard a little because it wasn't sweet. It had its own spicy kick going on lol  I wish I could have stayed all day grazing items from their menu. Unfortunately neither time nor space in my stomach would allow for that.   Please come to Southern Cali so I can visit more often!",

Vegan food is not that easy to find in these parts--or at least it wasn't when I last lived here.  So, here I am.  I'm back.  This place was highly recommended.  I went the first chance I had.  I had the steamed buns and the tamales.    The steamed buns had some flavor, but were mostly disappointing.  Steamed buns are just about my favorite food so this was sort of heart breaking.  I wanted to love them. But the bun itself wasn't steamed long enough and was still sticky dough on the inside.  I think it was because they were so much thicker than the usual bun.  Also, the tofu, mushrooms, and spinach did not give any textual difference.  No crunch.  I think tempeh would have been a more exciting protein on the bun.  Also, I needed more sauce.  Then, I had the tamale.  It could have been great.   But it was far to thick.  Like, big cylinders.  The masa was a bit dried out in places.  The filling however was delicious. I think the whole thing would have benefited from a sauce of some kid to accompany it.  Service was kind and lovely.  I was given space to enjoy and checked on without being hovered over, which is something I appreciate.  I'll definitely give the place another go, but I'll try other items.",

    "text": "Perhaps it makes me sound cheap, but I would not have tried this restaurant out if it wasn't vegan for the shear fact that you have to pay for parking. This is just a pet peeve of mine. If you are going to a business to spend money, I don't think you should have to pay for parking. So, for VegeNation; please look into validation for parking. The menu is packed full of yummy and interesting options. We opted to share the jalapeno, sausage, and pineapple pizza and the pot sticker appetizer. I enjoyed the presentation of each of them. The potstickers came out in the bamboo steamer baskets and chopsticks. The pizza was a nice size and the combination of the sweet pineapple, savory sausage, and spicy jalapenos were spot on. I would have liked parm on the side of the pizza, but that was not offered. It's hard to find good, let alone great vegan pizza and this was one of the best. Neither of us could resist finishing the meal with one of their sundaes, and this would be a non negotiable if you're ordering from here. I got the peanut butter and jelly sundae; homemade peanut butter ice cream topped with fresh blueberry compote. This was good, and would have been amazing had I not tried my husband's brownie sundae. This was topped with fresh strawberries and what tasted like crumbled up Heath bar. Plus the chocolate brownie was more decadent than the blondie mine was served with. Overall a must stop if in Vegas and we will be back again. Oh....and do not forget to check in on Yelp and get your free Sangria. Quite refreshing.",

I've seen good reviews here, so this Southern girl thought I might keep an open-minded and step out the pork zone for a bit.   Facility: Small cafeteria feel, but hipster place located in the same strip mall as Zydeco and Glutton. Guess I won't talk about Zydeco having the best catfish and Glutton having my favorite burger in Vegas so I won't gross out the Vegetable peeps reading this. LOL!  Service:  although there were 4 wait staff walking around this small room, I can't believe how many times I attempted to waive someone over to be ignored. I was really disappointed, because when they finally did see me standing on the table with bright orange cones waiving them in, they were very nice to speak with. All of them...very pleasant dispositions.    Food:  yeah, um...how do I say this politely...nope! Not for me. I like a good salad and I love vegetable side dishes, etc, so I thought there would be something yummy to me here. The food was just super bland. Spices are ok in the vegan menu, right?   Now before you cast me back to my red meat roots...yes, I admit there was pork fat back in my baby bottle, but I really do love veggies. At Italian restaurants, when I order pasta, I usually only order vegetables in it. I can skip the meat...however, I can't skip out on flavor, and in my opinion they did.  Mexican Hummus - 2/5 - did not take like hummus, rather just plain black beans. At least there was a half of a jalapeno in there I cut up and added to each chip.  Tamales - 2/5 - bland, bland, bland. I had to ask for salt, and then added it to the hummus too. I like the masa, the pumpkin and chiles, but it was just so boring and bland. The waitress said she likes to ask for extra chiles...doesn't that tell you something? Ravioli - 3/5 - ok, this one was ok, but too sweet. I guess it was the sweet potatoes, but it almost seemed if they added sweetener, like honey or something. I like my pasta savory, not sweet.   Overall:  I apologize to all the Vegans that love this place, but in my defense, even my long-time strict Vegan friend told me it was very bland and disappointing to her too. I mainly gave it a 3 instead of a 2, because the staff were so polite and nice, and even comped my tamales. However...it was just not enough for a good dinning experience.  Im sorry, but I won't be back. :(",

The hostess wasn't the best as she seemed overwhelmed with the amount of people in the restaurant, but it really could have been worse so she should work on that...but the waiter we had was fun, bubbly, and full of energy. I like her positive attitude and felt more comfortable after meeting her. The food was delicious, try the buffalo cauliflower! We also tried the tamale appetizer and split a sweet potato quesadilla. I loved the quesadilla but my friend and I both agreed that it needed something else in it, maybe corn or peppers to add more texture since sweet potato and black beans are already both really mushy. But overall I was definitely impressed and can't wait to try more things on the menu!",

    "text": "So I am not vegan, (I am currently trying to go vegetation though) but man do I love vegan food. I have been wanting to try this place forever and finally got a chance to go last night. There are so many interesting new places to eat popping up in hip downtown Las Vegas but Vegenation was first on my list. I went with my bf and our friend and his gf visiting from California, both of the guys are meat eaters but our friend's gf is vegan. Everyone loved this place! We ordered six different dishes so we were able to try a good variety.   Save the tuna: vegan sushi roll with \"forbidden rice\" really tasty, I already love veggie sushi so this was a no brainer to order. I think most of the ingredients they use are seasonal/local so I think the filling of this roll changes but ours had mango, green onion, bell pepper and avocado with what I think was pumpkin puree on top.   Dumplings: these were my favorite! They are a pretty good size and are served dim sum style. I honestly think these are better than meat dumplings. Full of flavor and the skin had a great texture. Also the sauce was delicious! I'm defiantly getting two orders of these next time I go.   Mushroom bao buns: looks like cha Sui bao at first but its shiitake and tofu! I really enjoyed these as well. Mushrooms and tofu were cooked perfectly and the bun tastes the same as any other bao bun.   Pho: I really liked the unique flavor of the their vegan pho broth but it was pretty spicy. I like my pho a little spicy but our friends gf couldn't really handle spicy so she asked for it to be made mild. Even mild this pho still had a pretty good kick to it so if you're sensitive to spicy food I would say not to order this.   Fruit loops salad: amazing! I was sharing with my bf and they split it into two plates without us even asking, awesome! I loved the grilled sweet potato and whatever cheese substitute they used for the salad.   Penne pasta with vodka sauce: it's called Russian something on the menu but I can't remember. This was realllllly good. I love love love vodka sauce and this did not disappoint. Really good size portion too.   Hibiscus tea: insane! So much flavor! They are free refills and they even give you one Togo when you leave! They also have \"juice cocktails\" alcoholic drinks made with fresh juice, I'll have to try one next time ;)   I can't wait to come back here and try their breakfast menu along with vegan pizzas they have. Another bonus is the place is decorated super cute and the servers are very informative and friendly.",

    "text": "I came. I ate. I left.  Vegenation is the vegan joint sponsored by Uncle Tony in the Fremont East corridor.   The place is charming and full of bright colors and is casual, making you feel hip for eating/venturing to a vegan joint. No animals were harmed for your meal. Unfortunately, your taste buds would be.  Appetizer: Tamales and the Vegan sushi. Tamales were mostly cornhusk with a small amount of filling. The filling was delicious, just not plentiful. Sushi was flavorful and colorful. This dish was pretty to look at and hit on all the sushi accent flavors. Awesome original flavors encountered; I was thinking \"we're in for a treat,\" but mostly everything fell flat after this round.  Round 2: Mushroom Pizza and butternut squash ravioli. The mushroom madness pizza tasted like a Diaya frozen pizza. I've had much, much better vegan pizza in downtown (Pop Up Pizza) and it's nicer on the wallet. The squash ravioli. What the fuck was that? Sauce was runny and flavorless. And the server recommend this!   Anyway, being a complete fatty on my cheat day, we ordered and split a blueberry cheesecake. This was pretty tasty. Not the greatest I've had, but it was pleasant and fresh and unique.  Vegenation is a place I really, really want to like. I will be back, as some items looked and smelled heavenly. I also wish they didn't have so many pasta and bread options. Processed foods are still processed foods, even if they are being served up in a cutely decorated joint in the burgeoning hipster Mecca that is Downtown Las Vegas.",

The service was eh okay, when we asked for a menu the girl said its available online and we could place our order there too. She did end up giving us a menu to look at and took our order \"old school\" style.  The tea was delicious and super refreshing. The tamales were out of this world good, I definitely recommend!!! The haus salad was awful, I ended up having to toss it out. The dressing was overwhelming and incredible spicy that I could not taste what was in the salad, all I could taste was spicy dressing, very disappointed especially because this place was a bit pricey, but because of the tamales I would definitely eat there again.",

Any time you go there, be sure to check in with Yelp so you can get a free sangria!

There's a community table option but with our four year old with us we decided not to chance it. Noise level is a bit loud if that matters to anyone but it wasn't too bad. Everyone was very nice and David, our server was great. Attentive and patient when we didn't know what to order and very friendly. I got the picante pinneapple pizza and it was delicious. I'm just counting down the days for it to be acceptable to go get another one! So. Good. Also got the black bean burger and a kids pizza. Chocolate mousse for dessert was banana-y and I'm not a fan of that but everyone else liked it. Overall great place to eat and we will definitely be here again, soon.",

When I went I ordered the \"Chicken & Waffles\" What I actually got was waffles & mechanically pressed soy proteins mixed with 87 other chemicals developed in a laboratory .  My Wife ordered the Mushroom pizza. The \"cheese\" was awful & slimy feeling. I have had many of vegan cheeses that are far better.   Service is OK. Extremely laid back but I get it. I just hate asking for my tea to constantly be refilled.   This place has created a cult like following for what ever reason. I've been twice & will never go back. With many new vegetarian options popping up in the valley it doesn't make since to continue to go here just to get mediocre food & service.",

We were pretty underwhelmed, which was disappointing because we really looked forward to eating here because they have a great mission and seem to be one of the first all vegan spots in town. As one of the highest rated and most recommended vegan restaurants in LV, we expected more.    We went on a Friday for lunch. It was not busy but service was super slow. The food was just okay. We shared the buffalo cauliflower wings, and I had the veggie burger and my husband ordered the meatball grinder. Nothing to write home about and definitely not the best meal we had on our trip. My meal made me feel kind of sick afterwards.   I think as more vegan spots open up around town, VegeNation will lose its appeal. I do believe in second chances, so I'll try to pop in next time I'm in town to give it another shot.",

One thing I would change would be the apples - I could do without the skin on but it isn't a deal breaker. I would order this dessert again & again if I lived nearby.

    "text": "First Time. Loved it.   Started with the Yelp Check-In giftie - a glass of lovely Apple Cider Sangria. Light and delicious.  Ordered the Meatball sub, which was really truly great! Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I'm all about the balls. These balls were Aromatic and slightly spicy - I can't wait to put 'em in my mouth again!    Ditto for the perfectly spiced potato wedges.  The desert (Brownie Sundae) was the only 'meh' part of the meal. This almond milk ice cream was more ice than cream, and not particularly tasty. Was the brownie 'raw'? It had that kind of texture. I prefer a more baked and crusty take.  Nevertheless I'll totally let that go. I really really like this place.  Awesome vibe. Seriously good food. Reasonable prices.  I'll just try a different desert next time.",

I don't like to write negativeive reviews but reflecting on this experience I had last Friday April the 7th brought back some unsavory feelings. For one I got there and asked for a table the hostess looks at me in a very confused manner and tells me to wait a second. So I for wait about five minutes and she takes me to sit down. From there this lady that was paying for her meal, starts talking to me. Ok cool, whatever I talk to her for a bit as a I wait for the waitress to attend me. So 30 min go by and still no waitress. Some new clients come in right away they get their orders taken right away ok what am I chopped liver? I have to go to the waitress to tell her what I want to drink. Mind you this is Vegas where customer service is a priority. She comes to me and gets my order because I had to go and get her; ridiculous. I ask for a basic ass Caesars Salad.  30 more minutes went by and still no salad. This place is horrible, it's a straight fad. I went to the waitress told her I would pay for my drink which was the orange Burst, which was good. I cancelled the salad. Don't come eat here on your own. This place is a social influencer's paradise; not a compliment. I left and went found the taco place next door which is called Santos Guizados and Taco's for all you malnourished vegans and vegetarians they have mushroom tacos as well. This place was a waste of time.",

The noodles were delicious with nice broth mix with vegetables. I wished they had more noodles, because all the ingredients taste the best when eaten all together. I really enjoyed the Pho and recommend the dish. The Pho was a light meal, good for the stomach. My friends ordered food that were heavier if you want to be stuff full.

    "text": "I wanted to be a fan. I've walked past Vegenation many times, but never stopped in because I'm not exclusively vegan and just end up picking other options in the area: it's a very competitive corner of DTLV. However, I like to partake in plant based options from time to time for health reasons and also love having dairy free options because lactose intolerance is the devil.   The restaurant itself is very clean, beautiful, green: the message comes across very clear. The menus are also cute and the description of dishes all sounded devine. Service was initially friendly and that's where it ended for me. Our hostess seemed to spend most of her time in the kitchen. She did check up on us once, but there were three other workers actively on the floor being inactive? Not sure if they were clocked out or what, but did everything to avoid eye contact/questions and weren't super friendly. It was confusing to say the least.  I ordered the thai curry vegetable bowl and my friend ordered the tamales and chili and black bean stuffed sweet potato. Everything was so bland! I could smell the curry in my plate, but I couldn't taste it because it was drowned in coconut milk and not seasoned otherwise. My friend's food was the same. We decided to wash down dinner with dessert and were excited to have a vegan version of cheesecake and ordered that. The texture was weird and the cake was hard. The blueberry compote on top was very bitter like it was made with unripe berries. I ultimately wish that the staff would review the recipes for some of these dishes because they need work on the flavor big time. This is not my first time eating vegan, but it was my first time eating at a vegan restaurant in Vegas and normally wouldn't bother me quite so much, but the price tag that came along with the meal was not worth it for bland food. Hope they improve soon.",

We were in town a few weeks ago and just loved this place. The vibe is really funky-fresh and modern. The food was really yummy. We had the buffalo cauliflower which was good enough that he had me make some when we got back home. A lot of places make a buffalo cauliflower, but it isn't crispy like the one here. And the house ranch dressing-OMG! The shiitake potstickers were good but not amazing. I REALLY enjoyed the eggplant stacks. It was super reminiscent of chicken Parmesan. They did it really well. The staff are friendly, and the owner is very involved. We came in twice during our stay, and he was there both times. Great place for vegetarians, vegans and meat-lovers to unite!",

Both were delicious and made us come back for lunch the next day. We went back and split the chick bang again along with Mole chicken tacos. Sandwich was great again, but the tacos weren't. They use taco shells instead of soft corn tortillas. That alone makes them not so great. The taco shells are baked-which is healthier and extra crispy and when done right really tasty with the right filling, but they were almost burnt. The filling was meh. Anything Mole is all about the Mole sauce, and the tacos hardly had any in them. They were dry and bland, and my friend said he still had the taste of burnt taco shell in his mouth after we left. Del Taco's beyond meat tacos are waaaay better and a fraction of the price.",

As a group of vegetarians & vegans, this restaurant had plenty of options for us. We loved the sushi (Save the Tuna) as well as the Coconut Curry bowl and Eggplant Stacks. All 3 were super yummy and tasty. We also tried the Food Not Bombs bowl (part of the brunch menu) as well as the Pot pie with Gnocchi, but didn't enjoy those very much -- too bland for our taste buds. The Bao was good but not as amazing as the aforementioned 3 items. Also enjoyed the hibiscus punch and the ridiculously good Lava Cake with coconut ice cream for dessert. Our waitress, both times, was very friendly and helpful. Would def return when in Vegas and now we know our favorite dishes.",

We split both dishes and we both felt sick about three quarters of the way through. Same symptoms, same time, same food. No coincidences here. We had not eaten since early morning and felt fine all day.   We have eaten here before and enjoyed it, (see prior review) and aside from our gastric discomfort, we were more disappointed to have been let down by the kitchen. Recommend a review of ingredients to check for expired or rancid food, a deep cleaning of the kitchen, storage areas and dining area, a check on refrigeration and warming area temperatures, refresh the condiments with new containers, review dishwashing and other sanitary procedures with the staff. We love supporting great vegan restaurants so it hurts us to say we can no longer recommend this one.",

Giving them 3 stars because my bf said that his meal was much better than his last one, plus I appreciated the effort from management to make it right. As for my meal, I really didn't \"enjoy\" it but I was starving so it beats leaving hungry. The majority of my fries were burnt to a CRISP. The mac n' cheese on the burger was tasteless. And why don't they wrap these burgers so they don't fall apart all over your plate?! Lol Again, the burger is great if you're really hungry (don't get me wrong), but I'm just not a fan of boca burgers whatsoever. If these aren't boca brand I'd be shocked cause they taste exxxactly like them. **Management advised me that these are beyond burgers** I've had beyond before, so these must be a new recipe. I never liked beyond burgers either but the ones I tried a few years back were better than these. Sorry, guys! If you like your burgers to taste more authentic & meaty (like the impossible burger - YUM BY THE WAY) or even more veggie like (for those who despise the taste/texture of meat), just skip the Mac daddy burger because in my opinion it fails to please EITHER side. Our server - Grace, was very friendly but pretty slow moving so we had to ask the busser to get her attention. Overall - much better experience than the last!",

The special of the day is displayed at the front in colorful chalk, and upon entering, there is a visual of lively vegetation, modern seating and tables, and despite it's busy operation, clean appearance. There is a map on the wall of the restaurant where customers can place a pin representing where they're from, too! Engaging, interactive, and lively, to say the least!  Service: Reasonable Yes, it was quite busy when I entered, but we were still served with a smile and prompt service. All of our questions regarding the menu items were answered promptly.  Food: Excellent! Vegetarian Chicken and Waffles? Count me in! The food tasted just like chicken and the waffles were amazing! The utilization of ingredients and how each item on your place complimented the next made a great dish served.  Summary: Worth multiple visits! Even if you're not vegetarian, this place serves great food for all palates. Worth the price: it's hard to find restaurants with good meat-substitutes, so big-ups to Vegenation!",

He made the experience palatable. I wouldn't go back due to poor tasting food. But would hang out with him!",

I have been a cook by trade, so I know my food.  This burger blew me away!   It was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted, meat or not.   It tasted as delicious and juicy as any beef burger I ever ate.   I cannot recommendation this place enough.   I will be back, many times!  Thank you VegeNation!",

But the food was the most satisfying of all.  For appetizers we started with the sweet potato tots which were very satisfying and tasty but not your most healthiest meal (btw, we def didn't pick any \"healthy\" options for this review! If you're looking for a healthier option check out the menu. My partner had the porta bello sliders (yummy deliciousness) and I had the Mac Daddy Burger.  The potatoes were very well seasoned and delicious! The burger was of course exceptional. To drink I had the sangria which was fair- not bad but nothing different from your average pineapple sangria. My partner had the perky potion with jasmine green tea, cacao, hemp seeds, and coconut oil, sweeten with organic agave. She didn't like it. I tried it and I think that's how it's suppose to taste- sooo...don't knock it till you try it. Overall, it was a very wonderful experience and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Downtown Las Vegas!   P.s the outside patio is really nice and the music is great here too!",

As a vegan and very conscious about the environment I'm not a big fan of the restaurant offering plastic straws.

The buffalo cauliflower wings were exploding with delicious buffalo sauce. Loved that you couldn't tell that it was cauliflower!  and their dill/ranch dressing is to die for! Out of Africa is definitely hearty and a little slimy because of the okra. It was a bit spicy but nothing unbearable. The brownie sundae was delicious and every scoop was full of flavor with all the fresh fruits and nuts. The brownie was a little too chewy but the ice cream made it easier to eat.

The Eggplant Stacks were delicious and my husband enjoyed the Jackfruit Tacos. The location was on the cusp of being not where I'd want be walking around late at night alone, but together we were fine. As night fell, it starting getting interesting...the Freemont Street experience is nearby and that in itself brings out a lot of characters. I would recommend to go early, because they do get busy!",

Would definitely recommend this place. We will be back soon ! Thank you !",

    "text": "What a different experience from what I'll just refer to as the unhealthy \"healthy\" vegan chinese food fiasco of last month.  This place, on the other hand, was a blend of fresh ingredients prepared with skill and balance.  I'm definitely a carnivore but if a herbivore dish is done right,  the meat is not missed at all.    The night started off on the right foot with free Sangria with Yelp check-in! Nice!  :)  Our table of 3 started with an order of the Buffalo cauliflower \"wings\" and they were superb.  I'm generally not the biggest fan of cauliflower and will only eat them if they're prepared in certain ways but this dish was certainly a cut above any cauliflower dish I've ever had before.  The cauliflower was cooked 'til semi-soft then charred to get some nice caramelized edges, then tossed in a perfectly spicy buffalo wing sauce.  The dish was served with some celery sticks and a house-made ranch dipping sauce.  The three entrees that were ordered were Masaman curry, Sweet potato ravioli, and the Russian standard which is gluten free penne pasta in a vodka sauce.  I didn't taste the other two dishes but my Thai curry was delicious.  The menu said it comes with sweet potato noodles but I think mine were rice noodles instead.  It had some al-dente vegetables in it with a thai yellow curry sauce.  The dish was really flavorful and the portion was perfect.  My friends said their dishes were great as well, they both have been here numerous times so know how good this place is.    The place is a bit on the small side with seating for about 50 maybe and has a cool trendy vibe.  I definitely like the music they were playing which ranged from The Cure to the Ramones, The Jim Carrol Band and Social D.  Very cool.  This area of downtown has some really good restaurants opening up and this place is a great part of that resurgence.",

She was surprised how good it was! I ordered the tamales, cheeseburger tacos, and a brownie sundae. I also got a berry blast smoothie. It was good and not too sweet. My friend and I also split the tomato, basil pizza. She also ordered the cheeseburger tacos, cheese tray and brownie a la mode. The tamales were delicious and super filling! The cheeseburger tacos were good I just wished it came with more meat as opposed to toppings. The brownie sundae was bombbbb. It's hard to believe I wasn't eating real ice cream. It was such a big dessert too. The items I enjoyed the most were the pizza and cheese tray. Man it tasted like real cheese. My friend couldn't believe it was cashew cheese. It came with the sweetest fruit! I lived it. Now this pizza we ate was A1! Soooo flavorful. It was some of the best pizza I ever had in my life omg. The service was friendly and attentive. It wasn't too crowded but was slowly getting there as we were leaving.  I would highly, highly recommend coming here. I will be back!",

    "text": "Oh the disappointment...oh the disappointment.  The wifey and I visited Vegas on a corporate retreat and decided to take a break from The Strip and headed to Downtown Vegas to grab a much-needed vegan bite from Vegenation.  The litany of 4-5 star Yelp reviews for this restaurant led us here.  For appetizers, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower.  It was spicy, saucy...and pretty good overall.  The vegan ranch that was served with it however was a little too thin to really use as a dipping sauce and it lacked flavor, but the cauliflower itself had great flavor.  For the main dish, I ordered the gnocchi chicken pot pie and the wifey ordered the mole chicken.  I actually ordered the pot pie per the recommendation of fellow Yelpers and was uber excited to try it.  The pot pie itself is more like a thick, creamy soup than an actual pie (there is no pie crust).  It looked promising...and once I bit into it...I tasted...well...nothing.  It was extremely bland...lacking in really any flavor whatsoever.  It literally tasted like it didn't have any salt in it...nor pepper...nor any other herb or seasoning.  I saw that a few other Yelpers mentioned this...but it was such a small contingent that I shook it off as random occurrence...until I ate my food.  I even swapped out my pot pie for the sweet potato and black bean quesadillas (per the waitress' recommendation)...and it was equally bland.  The only thing on the plate that had any flavor was the tiny ration of guacamole that came on the side with it.  My wife's mole chicken was also nearly flavorless.  It had just a subtle hint of chocolate in the mole sauce, had no spice, and had little other flavors.  It was also extremely bland.  Significantly worse than any mole sauce you'd find at even the most haphazard and dilapidated of Mexican joints in the grimiest of back alleys across the country.    We both checked-in on Yelp and were each able to get a smoothie.  I ordered the chocolate peanut butter smoothie and my wife ordered a green smoothie.  I liked my smoothie, but my wife did not enjoy her green smoothie.  On a more positive note, the decor of the restaurant was really cool.  Lots of faux foliage on the walls with cool artwork.  The ambience was great, but the food itself...didn't deliver in the least bit.  I really wanted this place to be as good as advertised on Yelp by fellow Yelpers...but it just wasn't.  All the potential was there with the trendy decor, great plate presentation, and expansive menu...but...the flavor was completely vacant.  We read about another place called The Modern Vegan designed for more brunch-oriented vegan dishes...but we chose this place instead.  The Modern Vegan may be worth visiting instead.",

    "text": "This is currently my favorite vegan cafe!   From drinks to starters to entrees to dessert, this restaurant is able to bring out savory and scrumptious dishes without any use of animal products!   When we walked into the cafe, we were greeted by a friendly young lady. Within 5 minutes, our table was ready (we went at 12pm on a Tuesday). Our waitress was able to give us great guidance, since it was our first visit and it really helped us in deciding which dishes to try.  Here are what we ordered:  Drinks - we had a cup of perky portion (taste like mocha without milk, but is thickened by coconut milk) and a glass of chocolate thunder (taste like chocolate milk with chia seed) - we'll probably try something else the next time we visit, since there are so many other options available!  Starter - we had hot tamale (steamed dough with sweet potato, lentil, mole and tomatillo sauce) - this is pretty flavorful - we'll order this again when we visit next time  Entrees - we had downtown tony which is portobello mushroom sliders (comes in 3 and are around hand palm size each) with vegetable slaw and siracha aioli and served with fries - as we are mushroom lovers, this dish definitely won our hearts! The portobello mushroom in the sliders is well done and lip smacking! The siracha aioli in the sliders was not overpowering, so the sweetness of the mushroom was evident. The fries won't fantastic as they weren't crispy but we'll still order this portobello sliders again during our next visit!  Pizza - we had a spicy picante pineapple pizza - it is a little like Hawaiian pizza. The pizza is topped with pineapple, italian sausage crumble, jalapenos and cheese. It was interesting to have cheese and Italian sausage crumble made from non-animal products, and though no animal products was used, the taste was not compromised! - we might order other interesting pizza to try and compare the next time we visit!  Dessert - how can we leave this cafe without trying out its desserts! So we didn't! We had brownie sundae which is a black bean brownie topped with caramelized banana, fresh berries and vanilla and chocolate ice creams! The black bean brownie was delicious and its sweetness was just right (not too sweet)! This dessert is yummy for a sweet tooth person like me! - I will definitely order this again to end my meal!   Don't forget to swing by the \"world map\" board at the back of the cafe which is near the restroom! U get to pin where u come from and it's cool to see the amount of pins in America and Europe as compared to other continents!   I will recommend this cafe!",

The prices are quite reasonable for what you get.  The service is warm, friendly, and exceptionally zen (Note: The zen vibe seems to be a trend among veg restaurants.  Is this a thing?).  Some booze is available, and on Saturday & Sunday mornings, (spicy) Bloody Marys and mimosas may be enjoyed at the special pricing of 2 for 1.  In fact, to keep things interesting, several drink specials are available on various days or times (happy hour) throughout the week, in addition to live music or dj sets.  The \"burger\" fell slightly short of my expectations to be honest.  I've tasted quite a few extremely convincing mock meats while dabbling with the vegetarian experience, and this one didn't quite do it for me.  However, the meatball grinder hit the mark 100%, and if you're hungry enough to add an appetizer, try the \"Bao Wow.\"  Delish!

The shiitake mushrooms added excellent flavor, the sauce is rich and creamy, and it has a good amount of peas, carrots and faux chicken. I didn't expect it to be overly spiced, it was flavorful and interesting with just a little pepper.  Overall, an excellent interpretation and a HUGE serving. The brownie desert was absolutely amazing as well, chocolate and vanilla ice creams with whipped cream and the brownie was perfectly chewy and delectable. Definitely holds its own when compared to popular LA vegan spots like Sage and Cafe Gratitude. Super happy I found this gem in Vegas!",

    "text": "Wow! I am blown away by how awesome this place is.   I'm not vegan, but dairy free. When my husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I told him that I wanted to be able to eat a nice meal without having to worry about avoiding dairy. He said he would find something great- and he did!   VegeNation is the bomb. I am seriously impressed by how flavorful and delicious everything was. Oh! And they have a kids menu! This is big for me because I wasn't expecting them to have one. Some places just don't think about children so we end up having to get the kids a plate to share that usually goes to waste. Anyway, both girls wanted pizza. I asked the waitress about the portion size of the pizzas and she said \"individual\". So, I'm thinking she meant the little 4 slice Target/Pizza Hut sizes. Nope! The pizzas were huge and delish! The cheese was creamy and rich in flavor and the kids gobbled up as many slices as they could.   Okay. On to the adult food. We ordered the cauliflower \"buffalo wings\" and they were nice. The buffalo sauce was tangy and had a nice bite. Not overwhelming but strong enough. They were served with a \"ranch\" dipping sauce.  Main course. Husband and I both ordered the \"chicken\" pot pie. Sooooo good! Creamy, flavorful, rich and chunky. Super rustic and so much of it! The waitress suggested that we just share since we were ordering the same thing but it was my birthday and I wanted to be a greedy ass and enjoy my own food. Welp! She was absolutely right. We could have shared. It was a ginormouse bowl of goodness that I couldn't finish. That was okay though because I was promised a free dessert for my birthday. I saved just enough room for it and I am so happy that I did.   I was given a brownie sundae. Ahhhmaayyyyzing! I believe the ice cream was coconut or almond based. Whatever it was, it was nice and smooth and was the perfect finish to an outstanding meal. The brownie was crispy around the edges, hot and chewy in the middle. It also came with bananas and berries that were incredibly plump and fresh. Geeze. This place is legit.   Cannot wait to go back!",

The ricotta cheese was awesome, and the eggplant was perfectly cooked.   The second time I had the Thai Curry. Good lord, also good. Unique too, in that they use glass noodles which made for an interesting change up.   The pros: 1) I seriously haven't had anything I didn't love 2) friendly staff 3) good price- the three of us are for less than $40  The cons None that I can think of.   I'll definitely be back, and recommend it for people trying vegan for the first time.",

    "text": "Brief Overview: VegeNation is a great plant based option for dishes that are flavorful and healthy. If you're looking for a Vegan restaurant in town, this is a must visit location.  Pros: - The dishes taste so good that they make you forget that you're eating vegan food - The french toast and waffles are to die for! - The decor is very green and hipster looking :-D - I go here the first Sunday of each month as a part of the Reset Project and love their breakfast options.   Cons: - It's a little noisy in the restaurant which makes conversation a little difficult during busy times - Not all food is 100% organic (but they source it that way the best they can)  Final Verdict: VegeNation is a wonderful restaurant for people looking for more plant based options that taste great. I know meat eaters that go to this place and love it!",

    "text": "My first impression of VegeNation was during the initial stages of construction and I was not pleased with Carson Street's most recent renovation. The branding looked terribly out of place with cartoonish and goofy signage and I was disappointed in the decision to give beautiful and historic mid-century modern storefronts a lackluster facelift inconsistent with the architecture of our lovely neighborhood.  If you can get past the sloppy branding I would recommend stepping inside and trying some vegan fair. Once inside, the decor is much more trendy and colorful with a great local vibe and chilled out ambience. South facing picture windows provide for great people watching and catching rays of that glorious Vegas sun. It's a great atmosphere for grabbing a table alone to catch up on reading and writing as well as for meeting friends and lingering a while.  I'm quite pleased to FINALLY have vegan choices here in my neighborhood. In a culture filled with comfort food, heavy eats, and meat biased menus, VegeNation is a great departure from the Vegas standard. Well done, Downtown! Flexitarians everywhere in our community are rejoicing.",

We shared four things: Save the Tuna \"sushi,\" the Muchos Gracias sweet potato quesadilla, the East West Taco, and the blueberry cheesecake.  I absolutely loved the quesadilla and cheesecake. They were literally perfect.  I don't see what the fuss is about the sushi - I don't even think it compares to the real thing like the other vegan items, but to each his own! I thought my friend's East West Taco did resemble chicken, but the sweet/savory flavors just didn't appeal to me.  I definitely want to come back here and try more things. It'll be hard to not get another quesadilla!",

    "text": "Ok I am kind of, a fan.. so far. I often do not rate a place until I have been at least a couple of times but, this review is based on a 1-time visit, and one take-out order. I had the same thing both times, as the take-out order was a surprise and happened to be the same exact thing I had - to an extent.   Both times I had the, now famous, SAVE THE TUNA - non sushi roll. With Forbidden Rice on the outside and various fruits and vegetables on the inside. The most recent visit had mango, avocado, and perhaps a carrot puree? I would have liked an explanation of what I was eating , as the very simple description on the menu states - 'Vegan Sushi - Forbidden Rice'. Which I take to mean that the ingriedients are seasonal or daily fresh items. So that's cool.. but something like that REALLY deserves a bit of explanation When being presented. The server was all over the restaurant as I think perhaps they were on low-staff situation. I dunno.. but I couldn't get a chance to ask her what I was eating. In any even - it was sort of good.    I also had the 'Mushroom Madness' Pizza - which I have had previously. I really like mushrooms and so that is a no brainer when I am at a loss of what to eat. This visit, I was very hungry so the server suggest that I try two types of pizza on each half. So I did that, and asked her to choose what ever else she thought would be good. She chose the 'Picante Pineapple' as the second half of the pizza. It consisted of 'charred pineapple, jalapenos, and 'sausage crumbles'. Its all vegan so it's obviously not real sausage and was remenicent of chorizo in flavor.   The chorizo-like sausage crumbles weren't too hot on the palate, but man, did it burn my chest for the next couple of hours. So I'll skip that next time. Whatever was used to season the 'sausage', really gave me some terrible heartburn. As I said, I really liked the mushroom pizza though, and would possibly get that again.   It was semi-filling, and I did not leave hungry.. I will say that I was a little bit dissapointed at the presentation of the sushi roll. It was a bit of a 'womp-womp' as it arrived on the table... It was colorful and good but loooked a bit deflated. I don't say that to be mean.. but you can sort of tell what I mean by the pic I posted.   Anyway, I may go back and try other things and then go from there.. we shall see... so.. HAPPY EATING TO YOU!",

    "text": "Hot Tamale ($5.95): Non-GMO Masa, pumpkin green chili, and lentils. The masa was pretty dry and it seemed to be from over-cooking since it was more dry in certain areas. Otherwise, the filling and chili was tasty (although I would've liked more of both).  My Little Dumpling ($5.95): Steamed shiitake mushroom and spinach. Fantastic dumplings! Plus, the accompanying sauce was perfect (and great with the other dishes). The dumpling skins were light and chewy and the filling was flavorful. Probably one of the best dumplings I've had, ever.  Bao Wow ($5.95): Asian BBQ tofu, spinach, shiitake mushroom, Bao bun. A nice concept of Bao, but wasn't something I loved.   Save The Tuna ($6.95): Vegan sushi; Exotic forbidden rice. Yum! A simply tasty sushi roll and bonus, it's also beautiful.   Picante Pineapple Pizza ($10.95): Charred pineapple, jalapeno, and sausage. Their pizzas are delicious!! The crust is crispy on the edges and the toppings are flavorful. They use Daiya brand Vegan cheese (which I already love). This particular pizza uses Vegan sausage that was rather good. The pineapple appeared to be from a can and not obviously charred, but it didn't take away from the dish being my favorite of the group.  Mushroom Madness Pizza ($10.95): Assorted mushrooms and herbs. Same great crust, cheese, and sauce. We requested half of Mushroom Madness and half of Picante Pineapple, which was a perfect sampling. I wasn't as fond of the mushroom bunch, but my sister loved it.  Ellen Degeneres ($10.95): Raw power tacos; collard green wraps. I really enjoy collard green wraps and etc. It's the perfect non-carb vehicle. These tacos are packed with various vegetables and other goodies; good kick of spice, too!  Casa Blanca ($11.95): Moroccan tagine of Harissa roasted vegetables. Great flavor; loved the assorted squash and root vegetables with the couscous.  Blueberry Cheese Cake ($7): Walnut crust, organic blueberries. Pretty delicious dessert considering there's no dairy. The \"cheese\" cake had a nice consistency and the blueberries had a good balance of sweet and tart.  Overall, I really enjoyed our meal. I'm definitely planning on a return visit and for it to be one of my go-to places in town. There's also so many other dishes to try and I'm looking forward to a cold-pressed juice cocktail. Service was phenomenal, too. Fabulous spot!",

The place has a chill vibe, sporting eco conscious decor, and offering sanctuary from the Vegas hustle and bustle.   The East West Tacos are listed as a must try, and they don't disappoint. The portions are generous, with a blend of sweet and savoriness that are beautifully prepared. After the first bite, I hardly slowed down until the trio of tacos had vanished!  I decided that my visit wouldn't be complete without a couple of starters. The Buffalo cauliflower makes for a good intro into plant-based cuisine, and the tamales are excellent; the green sauce complements the pumpkin and masa nicely. Stop reading and go to VegeNation now.",

Not a vegetarian although her husband eats veg a lot. We had lemonade chia coconut water which was to die for. I ordered the African Yam Stew with quinoia, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. Rachel ordered the mushroom sliders. All was freshly prepared and delicious.   The restaurant itself was farm to table, with an outdoor seating area as well. The staff was friendly and even our server Art said that he has changed his eating habits since working here.  Way to go Vegenation & Chef Donald!",

I think the French toast is my favorite, perfect balance, I can't handle anything too sweet. The coffee was great and came in a French press which I love.   Not super expensive either. Plus they open at 8am! And Vanessa, the waitress, was totally the sweetest! Great people, good vibe. You gotta check it out!",

    "text": "The mock sushi tricked your mind into thinking you were eating at a five-star sushi restaurant. Thickly sliced red bell pepper was the replacement for ahi tuna, and surprisingly, it worked! Avocado gave the roll creaminess that it desperately needed. The vegetables were rolled in nori and red rice, and served with wasabi cream, sweet potato puree, and toasted white and black sesame seeds.      The vegetable tacos were tasted very organic and clean. The filling had the texture of shredded tofu and the flavor of hemp milk, which is a very sweet \"milk\" made of seeds. Then, the filling was scooped into three flour tortillas. Guacamole generously topped each gorgeous taco. Even though it had the texture of baby food, it was jam packed with the flavors of earthy cilantro and smoky grilled jalapenos.       My yam stew was bursting with earthy flavors that I absolutely adore, such as sweet potatoes, grilled peppers, chickpeas, and roasted peanuts. The ingredients were doused with a spicy peanut sauce that tasted like a thinner version of ndombe. Ndombe is Cameroonian condiment made of palm tree butter. However, the raisins gave the dish an unnecessary sweetness that made my mouth longing for water.       The penne with hemp pesto was satisfactory. Pasta is very easy thing to cook, however, the pasta at VegeNation was slightly overdone. Therefore, the pasta had no texture which resulted in a flat dish. Luckily, the pesto had a fabulous texture which masked the overcooked texture of the pasta.      Overall, I'm sure every carnivore out there  would enjoy VegeNation because of its diverse menu and eclectic decor.",

I probably had more wine and sangria (both are exquisitely tasteful) than I probably should have, but this is vegas so bottoms up! I ended up being real basic and unadventurous by ordering the spaghetti, no meatballs. Anyway, the pasta was really good! I tried asking for parmesan, but naturally, being a vegan restaurant and all, they didn't have any. Instead, the waitress offered me a yeast substitute. I'm sure the expression in my face was less than enthusiastic but I told her I would try it anyway. Conclusion: the yeast just wasn't for me, but kudos to anybody who finds delight and taste in the fungal substitute. Bypassing the fact that I'm just really not a vegan, this restaurant is the truth. They hold True to their cooking and dietary standards, which is great for people who may have or need restrictions when it comes to their food. The atmosphere was warm and very chill and all of servers were really nice.",

This place is rad, bad and stops me from being sad.",

We loved the dumplings and I had the Big Haus salad, as I use salads as a benchmark for most veggie restaurants. It was excellent, and the ginger-soy dressing was a great choice. We will definitely be back and look forward to the opening of the patio. Keep in mind that the place just opened, yet everything is working quite well (minus the fact that they were out of the IPA, but that's ok).",

    "text": "Had the Save the Tuna sushi appetizer and the Muchos Gracias sweet potato/black bean quesadilla.  Came in for lunch around 1:30.  Happy to see that almost every table was full.  Attentive service right away - yes please to water, its only 105+ outside :)  I knew already what I was NOT going to order - the African Yam Stew.  I am still pining away for Steph & Justin's VegOut AYS - nothing could top that dish!  I couldn't decide between the meatball sub or the quesadilla, until I saw the table next to me get the quesadilla.  It looked good so I ordered that.  Sushi came out almost immediately.  Today there was a red bell pepper strip, some avocado and what tasted like a carrot puree on top.  Really good, flavorful and tasty.  Scarfed those 6 little rolls down in a blink of an eye.    Then the quesadilla came out.  Very pretty with the chipolte sauce drizzled on top.  My order was mostly sweet potato puree with some black beans sprinkled throughout.  So it was kinda mushy to eat.  But it had just a slight spicyness because of the chipolte sauce.  I wish there had been more sauce and black beans.    Between those two dishes, I was too full for dessert.  Next time.  And there will be a next time.  Tip:  paid metered parking ends at 9th.  I parked on the side of the apt complex at 9th & Carson and walked the 2.5 blocks down.  No problems :)",

I was dining by myself, escaping the expensive resort \"strip\" restaurants. I have hear about this place from other vegan friends. So I was excited to dig in! I got up to use the restroom and must have been gone 1 minute or 2 at the most. When I came back my table was cleared. Then the waitress came up a shocked look and said oh you are still here? Yes, my God, I went to the bathroom for a minute or so. So they had to bring everything back out. Then it was just awkward. I didn't say anything because I felt like they had already deemed me a criminal or a \"dine and dasher.\" I've never felt so judged at a restaurant. It's too bad I was ready to rank a 4-5 star with the food because it was good. But, please, I respect my service staff in every restaurant I go to and always tip 20-25% unless the service is awful. I actually tipped 20% for this experience too. They work hard, but don't get up to go to the bathroom unless you notify someone you're not running out the door!",

    "text": "Vegenation is a hip restaurant in downtown Las Vegas with a completely all vegan menu. It gets four stars for taste but I'm rounding up to five stars since Vegenation has such a wonderful impact in the vegan community, is stringent about buying locally, and has such great weekly events - Can you say Pop-up menus, 2 for 1 Happy Hour drinks, Brunch Specials, AND Meatless Mondays with DJs?? There is always something fun going on here it seems like.   I've ate at Vegenation a few times and I will definitely be back to sample more items from the menu, but here's what I've had so far: FRENCH TOAST WITH FRUIT ($10.95): This was my first dining experience with Vegenation, and I was not impressed. I was able to get 2 for 1 mimosas on this visit, but for $18 it just didn't feel right. I really should have went with something more unique, like the breakfast burrito with tofu chorizo. Fortunately, I vowed to give Vegenation a second chance! 3/5  CHICKEN N' WAFFLES ($12ish): This dish sold me completely on Vegenation. The 'chicken' tasted amazing and the portion size was huge! Served with potato wedges and a side of maple syrup and hot sauce. This was my second visit. :) 5/5  PRO TIP: This dish is only available on weekends and is known to sell out!  MEXICAN HUMMUS ($6.95): A large appetizer with plenty to go around. My party of four really liked this interesting hummus made out of black beans. 4/5  CHICKEN POT PIE ($11ish): How could I not get this for dinner? The chicken bits tasted great and the sauce that topped this vegan medley was thick and creamy. Tasty, but I was kind of disappointed that the pot pie wasn't actually stuffed in a pie crust. Had this for my third visit and already looking forward to my fourth visit! 4/5  VIBE: Hipster, Eco-friendly, and the patio out front is great for people watching. 5/5  PRO TIP: Follow Vegenation on Instagram for updates, specials on drinks, and info on validated parking.  I'd recommend Vegenation to all vegans and vegetarians! I brought my omnivorous friends here and they loved it too, so don't think you can't bring the whole gang here. Keep on keeping on Vegenation. You rock!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #27",

It wasn't terrible but it was very overpriced for being mostly vegetables. For example the salad was literally 95% mixed greens and 5% other stuff. I'd expect more given it was like $15. 2 stars because I could made the same dishes for way less fraction of price. Nothing was special.  If you want good vegetarian/vegan food I'd highly recommend going to the bronze cafe at the market instead. They have WAY tastier and unique menu items.",

    "text": "VegeNation is my new favorite vegan/vegetarian/everything restaurant in Las Vegas! Food is fresh, flavorful, and reasonably priced -- and you even get a really nice atmosphere and booze to boot!  My husband Joe L. and I visited for brunch on our last day in LV before heading home from an action-packed weekend. We had wanted to come for dinner the night before but they were experiencing a power outage due to a bad storm that had just dumped buckets of rain on the area along with thunder and lightning. Someone from the restaurant was nice enough to call me on my cell to inform me what was going on, and we were able to cancel our reservation without problem.   When we walked into the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, I was immediately impressed with the decor and vibe: tons of plants hanging from the ceiling, long wooden tables, nice decor, and a mellow but hip atmosphere. Yup, it definitely felt more hip than hippie to me, and that made it feel more upscale and quaint. Apparently they also have a beautiful outdoor patio, but there was a private party going on so we didn't get to see it on the day we visited. There was also a talented singer/guitarist performing which provided good if not a bit too loud entertainment and ambiance.  Our server was so sweet, helpful, and friendly, and we were quickly hooked up with a large French press pot of delicious coffee. I ordered off-menu (thanks, Yelp!) chicken and waffles and hubby got the meatball grinder. We also ordered a save the tuna roll as an appetizer.   As we were waiting for our food, gorgeous plates of pizza, sandwiches, salads, and other items passed us by making us even hungrier. As soon as our save the tuna rolls came, we quickly devoured them. They were flavorful yet light, and each one was topped with what I think was described as a smoked carrot puree. It was creative, beautiful, and very good.  Our main courses came out shortly after. The meatball grinder was phenomenal! The meatballs were chewy and meaty, and the tomato sauce was perfectly seasoned. The crispy yet chewy roll was toasted just right, and the whole thing was topped with melted parmesan cheese. I would think any meat eater would be happy eating this sandwich, and it hit all the right spots for a vegetarian like me. Sandwich perfection, indeed!  The chicken and waffles was another winner. The fluffy waffles were smeared with a spicy chipotle (I think) mayo and topped with large crispy chicken pieces. It was served with the requisite cup of maple syrup. Talk about hearty food! I could barely eat 1/4 of this dish because it was so filling and satiating.   We were ready to call it quits but had already taken advantage of the sweet Yelp check-in deal of a free sundae. Seriously, who can say no to free ice cream?? It too was awesome! Topped with a crunchy toffee or granola of some kind and drizzled with syrup and fruit, it was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Thanks VegeNation for elevating vegan dining in LV to an outstanding experience!",

We came in about an hour before they closed but the staffed carrier themselves in a matter in which it was like they needed to start cleaning up cause it was time to go. There are soooo many place that try and rush you out but this place did the exact opposite and we appreciate that ! I got the chicken pot pie and wow was that a mouth full. Its so good and so filling.   My bf got this type of meatball sandwhich and i couldn't stop picking at his food haha. The only complaint i have is that i couldn't get the Vegnation burger or sliders because they ran out of buns but my chicken pot pie, the meatball sandwhich, our cauilflower wings (which was so good and were not too fried so we loved it) , the sangria that was free with yelp coupon, and the service that Faith had provided more than made up for all that.   The bill ended up being about 39 dollars which for us being from Cali and everything being super expensive, we were more than satisfied with what we paid, the portions,  and the service. Definitely would recommned and we will without a doubt be back before heading home !",

    "text": "I have to agree with Kevin L. (below). This place, albeit filled with positive vegan vibes, is really a miss on the food. Like Kevin, I am currently a carnivore, but I do like my vegetables. And I was a vegan (raw food vegan, mind you), for 2 years...many moons ago. I have enjoyed scrumptious vegan fare on the East Coast, particularly in Brooklyn, New York. So, when a fellow former New Yorker invited me here, I had high hopes. But frankly, they were dashed (hard) to the ground.   But let's start with the positive first. It's a swanky, hip, big city feel, intellectual dive. That's an unique ambience for Las Vegas, especially for downtown. The scene is a quiet sanctuary. The waitress was sweet and wholesome. If I had just come for a cup of coffee, I would give it 5 stars.  But I didn't come just for coffee, but for lunch, and it was surprisingly bland and somewhat sloppily executed. First, the menu items (as Kevin complained of) were odd. There appeared to be \"meat\" on the menu, and I was worried at first if I had actually come to a vegan restaurant. Then, I realized that these were faux meat options, called \"meat\" but were actually some kind of non-meat, meat substitute. Though it is clever, it is a little credibility-reducing. A True Vege-Nation should be unapologetic about its embrace of plant foods, and not try to disguise them as anything other than what they are.  When I was a vegan, I never ate such fake foods.  Secondly, the menu seems a bit disjointed. There is no unifying structure or sense to what is offered, and it is hard to navigate, despite being large in its offerings. Then, as said before, when the food does arrive, you feel it is missing something in flavor, and in execution. It's overcooked or undercooked, or underdressed, or perhaps overdressed. But it's missed its marks somehow.  The presentation, however, is very pretty. That and the atmosphere is what it has going for itself.  Again, that is enough for a cup of Joe, and maybe (maybe) dessert. Not more.   I don't know why the high number of favorable reviews of this place. Some may honestly believe this is as good as it gets for vegan restaurants, probably because they are desperately lacking for them, and don't know better or, more dishonest, simply want this place to succeed as a statement. I don't know. But don't you be fooled, dear reader. Better to go with one of the many other slick, smart, and delicious hangouts downtown, and order veggies.",

Everything is locally sourced and plant based. I was surprised at the big portion sizes. I was expecting to still be hungry but I was actually quite full. The prices here are pretty reasonable, too ($7-10 a plate).  If you check in on Yelp, you get a delicious glass of Sangria. I ordered the Save the Tuna appetizer (vegetarian sushi), which was amazing. I was trying to decide between the meatball sub and quesadilla. The server recommended the sub, but now I wish I had the quesadilla. The sub was good, but not amazing. I'll have to come back and try the quesadilla.  My only complaint is that I wish the menus were more visual/included pictures of the items. Seeing all that text is overwhelming.",

Not my favorite...the texture was offputting, kind of like a gritty, mushy almond flour, oatmeal texture..the espresso flavor was very light and it was put together like a parfait.

We went to VegeNation today and it was wonderful !!! The food and numbers of options on the menu was great!! The price was quite reasonable and the staff were SO friendly and fast. Their service and attitude was amazing! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone whether you are vegan, vegetarian or just like to eat good food. The entire menu is plant based & is delicious! Great job VegeNation you have earned yourselves repeat future customers!!",

The servers are very friendly and you can tell they believe in their food. The vegenation burger tastes better than beef... wow! The hot tamales come with two, which will leave you wishing you ordered two orders. End on a sweet note with the brownie sundae with almond milk ice cream. Honestly I felt my taste buds smiling after eating all this yummy, healthy food. This place makes eating vegan so easy and enjoyable. I wish they had one in Miami.",

Entering we are immediately seated and noticed the fresh greenery displays and art displaying the positives of being vegan/vegetarian. I appreciate the it's support towards other local business too.  We got the \"Save the Tuna\" for an app, which was very fresh and filling. I ordered the Downtown Tony. There was a portobello mushroom replacing where the meat of the burger would be, and was delicious.  For dessert we had wanted to order the choco tacos, but the waitress said they were out of that and let us order any other dessert and it was in the house- that was very much appreciated. Our brownie sundae had a warm brownie with ice cream in top with fresh fruit.  I am definitely coming back here again!",

I started off with the Cylon Tea with a hint of mango:  It was delicious without any added sugar (which is the entire point).  I must of asked 10 questions of my server and other team members in the first 5 minutes.  They were all very knowledgeable with the menu and answered my questions thoroughly and patiently.  They were all terrific.    Although I had a tough time deciding on what I wanted, I finally decided on the Thai Curry Vegetable Bowl.  When it arrived, the sweet potato noodles were swimming in a think curry sauce.  Zucchini, sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, and other vegetables topped off the dish.  Although a lime squeeze was available, I decided to just dig in.  OMG, it was incredible.  The blend of the curry sauce, vegetables and noodles was a hit.   As a side note, the table across from me ordered the black bean burger.  I have no idea how it may taste; however, it looked hearty and was served with a few (what appeared to be) large cut fries.  That will be my next conquest at VegeNation.........That is if I do not have a curry craving.",

I have a nut allergy and our server was quick to point out what would be great for me and what we can remove from a dish to keep it nut free.

It was good and very filling/rich, I think I drank maybe 2/3 of it before it became too much for me. I found it very strange that it was cool (temperature wise) not cold. I'm not super picky so I drank it, but I would have preferred it colder.  My friend got the iced coffee, she enjoyed it and we split the black bean hummus, which was DELICIOUS. I was really skeptical as I enjoy hummus greatly, and I found that I really enjoyed that one.   The service was wonderful, and they let us sit for a couple hours, we didn't feel rushed to leave or anything. They refilled her coffee a couple times and provided waters with refills. The ambiance was really interesting, it was a really cool place and I would definitely be back to try more of their food rather than just the smoothie and hummus (though again...that hummus was fantastic).",

    "text": "We were visiting from Los Angeles and while we we were dining at another establishment the server told us about VegeNation , and  since we are both vegans we were very excited to give it a try. Firstly, the vibe at the restaurant is unusually warm friendly and welcoming. The owner and chef, Donald , must take great care of his staff and treat them so well because the synergy among the staff was remarkable. I cannot rave enough about the food! We have dined in vegan restaurants from Los Angeles to New York to Portland to Paris, France and hands-down this is the best vegan food we have ever had! It was so good that we dined there two nights in a row. If we were here another night we would've been there three nights in a row. We tried the sweet potato quesadilla , the sweet potato ravioli, the tacos, A switch and brown rice special forbidden rice sushi, and the blueberry cheesecake. Each item I would rate a 10 out of 10. We met  the chef, Donald. Not only was he warm and friendly but his culinary skills are off the charts!!! I love that his staff can express their individuality complete with mohawks , dreadlocks , and tattoos and without a hint of attitude. I am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas just so that I can dine at VegeNation again!",

You can even bring your dogs here if you're going to eat in the patio area.",

We also split the carrot cake which was awesome - note that it's not your traditional cake... It's a raw vegan cake made with carrots, nuts, spices and deliciousness. The chef also treated us with some date & cacao truffles which were great. Loved it all (except the logo, but that's my own aversion to any cartoony logo - I think it degrades the quality perception of the restaurant).",

I wish I was in Vegas more often so I'd have more time to go back and try more of their menu, as there were a ton of good looking options on there.  The atmosphere was also nice, as I was there alone and sat at the large community table where I had some nice conversation with the other solo guests.  There was a big storm the particular night that I was there that knocked out the restaurant's POS system so it took them a while to get me a check.  To make up for the long wait they offered me a dessert on the house, which was a really nice gesture.  I wasn't upset by the wait though because I was enjoying the food and conversation (both with waiters and patrons) so much.  Overall really great place for vegetarians and vegans, and I can't wait to visit them again next time I'm in town.",

Our Appetizers recommended by our Server were:  *Save The Tuna Vegan Sushi Exotic Forbidden Rice (Nice kick of hot/sweet)  and  *Hot Tamale Organic Masa, Pumpkin Green chilis and Lentils  Our Meals were:  *Daniel Negreanu Meat Ball Grinder Parmesan Style *Muchos Gracias Organic Sweet Potato Quesadilla Black Beans, Chipotle Crema *Downtown Tony Portobello Mushroom Sliders Sriracha Aioli  Drinks were awesome and fresh.  I ordered the Brownie Sundae (Minus the Sundae) with Caramelized Banana to go-thought I could have it for a late night snack...ate 1/2 of it on the way home.  Soo delicious...........  Owner/Chef Donald makes his presence on the floor and of course I was thrilled to introduce him to my family. The Lemperle family are all quite talented and they truly have made a name for themselves in Las Vegas.    Plant Based Menu to Perfection! We will be back with more family/friends soon.   Little info on Salme Lemperle  (Salme's Organic Hairdressing Best Cuts & More)",
