    "text": "We followed my friend's \"beer-sense\" to this charming burger joint on the Vegas strip and found that this place has great beer, but that greatness is overshadowed by their delicious burgers and thier fantastic  garlic herb fries. For the first time, I actually felt sad as I was finishing my burger because that meant that my experience of eating would soon be over. *tear* Our waiter was also very attentive and friendly throughout our entire meal. The seating is also interesting since it's outdoors in an area with fans and continuous mist of water to keep you cool while enjoying a patio experience. If you visit Vegas, this is a must-eat-at place. This place has set a new bar for me in terms of burgers.",

Amazing burgers, great fries like Sweet Potato Fries with really yummy dipping sauces, Fab drinks, the Servers are super friendly and fast: and the ambience is extra special with great views of the Las Vegas Strip and Wynn right across the street. Additionally, the price is right on point, very reasonable. Will tell all my friends, and I have gone there many many times and will go back many more!! Janel T.",

    "text": "Came here with my friend, partly to eat burgers, partly to try to catch the little stray kitten that hangs out in the area. Mostly to kitty-capture.  Nonetheless, I ordered their veggie burger and some sweet potato fries. It seems like its mostly outdoor seating, which wasn't fun cause it was a windy night, but they try their best to accommodate you with windbreaking see-through walls put up and outdoor heaters going, wasn't too shabby. Place was very clean and the waitress was nice.  The veggie burger was made out of some sort of rice and peppers, which was super good and not like anything I've had before. Unlike most burger places that just slap a Boca burger on a bun for the vegetarians, this place thoroughly impressed me in that aspect.  The fries were super tasty, I don't know what they did to them but it was like magic.  Alas, after our delicious meal there was no little kitten in sight, and with heavy hearts we left our number with the waitress to call if they ever caught it. Poor kitty!",

I could see that there was at least one waiter - though he looked pretty swamped - so after about a half hour of nobody taking my order, I went up to him at the register and asked if I could place an order.  He told me to order at the bar.  I went to the bar, and the bartender there told me to order from the waiter.  I went back to the waiter who told me that it was too late to order food, and then he went to another table, and took their food order.  I went back to the bar (it's now after 11PM) and tried to get a beer. She said that last call had already happened.  I tried to be polite when I told her my opinion of her unannounced last call and the complete waiter fail. She grudgingly  agreed to put in an order for me.  The food was tasty, but not worth the disastrous lack of service.",

    "text": "Another upscale burger place but unlike the other ones this is one is overpriced for no reason.   Stripburger is tucked away in the North corner of the Fashion Show Mall. Its a pretty small restaurant and actually looks like a patio of another restaurant. The seating is all outdoors under a series of tents so make sure the weather is nice. Turns out the restaurant actually shares a kitchen with a neighboring Mexican restaurant (El Segundo Sol), along with bathrooms and some waitstaff.  For the most part, the menu is similar to other 'fancy burger' places. Each burger runs around $10-12 bucks. The traditional cheeseburgers or whatever are cheaper and their 'specialty' ones are more expensive.... An assortment of fries each around $4-8, and of course alcoholic milkshakes.  I tries to the KBBQ burger which just seemed like a regular patty with some Kalbi sauce on it. Pretty average. The atomic fries are regular fries layer with Velveeta cheese and jalapenos. The food here isn't bad, its just not that good. If you want a good burger check our Holsteins or Burger Bar way better.",

Needless to say she was amazing, polite, and genuinely cared about our experience. We never had an empty glass and she did not pressure us to order alcohol either.   We ordered two shakes (fudge chocolate, amazing), a side of sweet potato fries (solid, tangy fry sauce and sugar), and two burgers. I had the green chili burger and my SO had the whiskey bbq. They were both pretty tasty and you could taste the meat without all the toppings overpowering it.   The food came out very quickly and the whole experience was wonderful. The hosts/bussers/servers/food runners were all smiley and welcoming, which honestly does a whole lot more than you'd expect.  Next time we come by, we'll make it a night time dinner to people watch and enjoy the atmosphere. So for two burgers, two shakes, and fries, our total was slightly north of $40, and we still tipped 25% because Rebecca was just awesome.",

Beers were extremely cheap, about $2 for a Sierra Nevada, and a fairly decent selection compared to many Strip area bars. In addition, the Pickle Fries were delicious. Additionally looking at their regular prices for beer and food, they seem affordable during normal hours as well. The location is on the northern corner of the Fashion Show Mall, sort of Strip Front but not the greatest people watching venue of the Mall as it's around the corner a bit. Still it is hard to argue with the outdoor atmosphere!  I can't speak to the quality of the burgers as I had just had a large meal, but I hear good things, so I feel safe enough giving this place 5 stars.",

Why you come to a burger joint and order chili - or why a burger joint even offers chili - is beyond me.  But whatever.  The chili comes and my companion is like, \"this is a bowl?\"  The eensy weensy ramekin has roughly four or five large spoonfuls of chili.  I might be exaggerating (not much), but for the price, you'd really expect a bowl to be, well, a bowl.   The service was acceptable, though we did see the bottoms of our drinks a few too many times.  What's strange is that our server took our glasses from us and went in the back to get refills.  I am not sure why they don't have pitchers or why she didn't just bring us an additional glass.  Whatever it was, refilling could have been far more efficient.  After having a below average burger, average fries and passable service, I'm not sure why anyone would go out of their way to come here.  I guess the old business adage about location is True.",

He is a burger aficionado so I knew he would enjoy a burger on our vegas trip. He got the western burger and a \"threesome\" (um ya... thats deep fried pickle chips, fries, onion strings). I got the chopped salad. The burger was excellent but the biggest thing was, and I quote, \"those are the best onion rings I've ever had\". Thats huge. I enjoyed the pickle chips and my salad was okay. The only con was there are no booths for those with bad backs to sit and lean, and some waitress took samples of milkshakes out to the strip and walked past me. I wanted one!!",

I wasn't sure if the reason it tasted so amazing was because I was sooo hungry (or maybe a little drunk) so I surveyed the other 5 people I was with. Everyone agreed- their hamburger was amazing!!   This is the perfect place to come if you have been drinking at the tables all day and have a little buzz on so don't really want to spend the money or time at a fancy dinner.",

    "text": "I'm disappointed, some of the yelpers must have really bad taste!  I actually enjoyed this place! When I was in Las vegas  like a week ago with my sisters, we were walking on the strip and we all had the same intention of wanting a good burger.  So I got out my iphone and located all the local burger joints and strip burger came up! We've been passing it for years ,but never bothered to even try it!   I looked at the reviews here on yelp through my phone and we wondered why so many people were giving this place such bad reviews.  With doubt in our minds, we were very hunger and craving burgers so we were just like f*&* -em let's try it for ourselves and see what we think. it's a pretty hip joint, it's all out doors,  the place has a great view of the strip,they got a full bar, the waiters and waitresses are pretty out going people, and so that was a plus. The service here was great, out waitresses never let our glasses remain empty and brought out our food fast.She was very accommodating and helpful. No complaints here. What I really loved about this place is the fact that they use all natural non-frozen beef and ingredients! As a Organic/Natural consumer thats a major plus right there. Nothing beats natural! I ordered a cheeseburger with American, and shared their natural cut herb Garlic fries with my sister and I was astounded!  The burgers here are delicious and the beef patties are cooked to perfection. The meat is oozing with juiciness and so much  flavor and the produce such as the lettuce,tomato and onion were extremely fresh and complimented the burger greatly!  The Herb Garlic fries are to die for! Like I said,  they're Natural cut and  cooked to order and they are loaded with lots of garlic! You'll be scaring of the vampires for quite a while! As guy who loves a lot of garlic, Strip burger  is right on the money with these fries! They do them better than Gordon biersch!  I was excepting a mediocre Burger and meal at best, due to reading all these reviews! but dining here has taught me is that you cannot always rely on the opinions of others, because we're all different and have different perspectives. You gotta try things out for yourself in life and have your own opinion about it.   Stripburger is officially in my Top 5 burger joints and have some of the best burgers that I've ever had!  Next time if you're in Las vegas on strip and  you want an outstanding  burger then  come to Stripburger and you're going to love it!",

    "text": "Strip Burger is the indoor/outdoor burger joint attached to the Fashion Show mall on the Strip side. Since we had a $100 gift certificate and the prices are reasonable, we had the freedom to over order and had a fair sampling of their offerings.  We started with three milkshakes, which obviously were a hit with the kids. The chocolate and strawberry were both good, but nobody really cared for the vanilla. It isn't too hard to blend ice cream with milk so no points were scored for this indulgent first course. My brother and I each had beer to go with our milkshake (bad timing) and my sister-in-law had a margarita that was shaken in one mason jar and served in another. The presentation was cute but because the drink tasted worse than a manufactured drink from a machine at Fat Tuesday's, all points were lost.  Disappointingly, the burgers weren't that great either. We had their self-proclaimed famous blue cheese burger ($9.95) and the hickory burger ($9.95). The meat itself was alright, but they hadn't considered using a necessary moisture barrier between the meat and the bun. A juicy burger cooked on a flat top is bound to drip, so the best method for preventing this is to first set the patty on a paper towel after cooking to absorb the excess liquid, and then use some other ingredient (or ingredients) to form a layer between the meat and the bun so as to prevent the bun from getting soggy, such as lettuce, onions, etc. Despite the misleading picture on their website, the bottom half of the bun turned into a thin mush. The flavor of the meat and toppings were alright, but not good enough to compensate for the burger's shortcomings, so overall they weren't terribly successful.  We also ordered the \"atomic fries\" ($4.75) which weren't atomic at all, though it is still hard not to make fried potatoes tasty with the addition of processed nacho cheese and green chiles. I wouldn't order them again, but shamefully we still consumed most of what was in the basket. The highlight of the meal was another side, fried pickles ($3.95). I had my hesitations but I am always intrigued by interesting fried things so we tried them out. The were crunchy, vinegary, and salty, and were served with a ranch dipping sauce. I could have had these and the chocolate shake and been very pleased with my lunch.  Despite the mediocrity of the meal, the prices were still quite reasonable for a casual Strip lunch and I can see why the place is usually busy. Gourmands on a food tour of Vegas certainly wouldn't eat here, but if you have friends in town on a budget that don't want to venture off the Strip, this is certainly a place a recommend. It's hard to find a sit down restaurant with such a prime location elsewhere that would cost you anything less than twice as much.",

My wife and I first shared the Nachos Fries. Pretty big plate of fresh fries and lots of toppings. A good start.  A good solid burger and bun. Actually  3 burgers -  we split the sampler trio. All good flavors. Probably a little overcooked. Added bacon without regret.   We each had an adult shake and slurped them down lo problem. Both were excellent: The Dreamsicle & Salted Caramel. My wife was crazy for the Dreamsicle shake. I went back a few days later just to get the Tres Leches shake - 5 stars! Excellent service.  Important note: it was 105F outside, yet somehow our outdoor area was cool and slightly breezy.",

I had the mushroom burger with Wisconsin cheddar cheese, and I had an order of sweet potato fries. The burgers are cooked to your liking, which makes them taste even better. the cheese was nice a gooey, and there were plenty of mushrooms! The burger itself was huge! The sweet potato fries were cooked well, and were sprinkled with a little bit of sugar to help bring out the flavor (good choice).  My boyfriend had the Mexican burger, and an order of atomic fries. The Mexican burger looked really good, and came with a grilled jalapeno pepper on top. He loved the burger, and especially enjoyed the cilantro that was in it. He said the atomic fries were good (cheese fries with jalapenos), but there was too much cheese (I know, hard to believe!)  Overall, this place has some great burgers and great sides.

My hubs and I were running around all day before catching our long, late flight to LV from NYC and hadn't really eaten much of anything. We checked into our hotel just after 11pm on Wednesday night, were starving and just wanted something really casual, quick and easy but couldn't find much available within walking distance.   We found Stripburger and it was perfect for our needs, late dining menu, super casual attire, and simple. My husband had a bacon cheeseburger with garlic fries and I ordered a bun-less turkey burger with avocado, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onion and tomato.  We were starving so I completely forgot to snap any pics but they were decent sized burgers and had so much flavor. I tried a few of the fries and they were actually \"worth it\" fries. I rarely find any French fries \"worthy\" but these were extremely garlicky, with a good crisp to soft potato-y inside ratio.   Given the circumstances, I'd definitely go back again but only in the event of late night dining availability within walking distance of our hotel. Other than that, there's just too many other options on the strip with way more to offer.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here to grab a quick dinner before a show.  The Stripburger was located in the Fashion Show Mall, and we had an outside seating on the patio.  They offer different types of burgers, shakes, fries, cocktails, beers, salads, chili, as well as appetizers.  They are even able to host special events, BBQs, and any get-togethers on the patio.  I had the Bacon & Cheddar Burger that came with thick-cut smoked bacon - the patty itself was very juicy, had a great amount of fried onions, and the cheese and the bacon made it nice and cheesy and crispy.  I actually thought it was pretty tasty for one of those 'gourmet' type of burger joint.  The side of atomic cheese fries (cheese and chili) was good, but I think I preferred it to be just regular fries as the chili and the cheese could be overwhelming.  Service was efficient and there were many people dining in!  +juicy patties!",

After taking a closer look, I saw that it was the biggest ROACH I've ever seen in my life. I asked to speak with the manager after talking to the bartender who seemed unbothered about the incident. Well, the manager stated that \"because of the heat, it is inevitable that they'll have roaches.\" I was baffled by her response because it is NEVER acceptable to just have roaches in a restaurant. If they're crawling out in the bar area, imagine what the kitchen might look like? It's all very concerning and unhygienic and disappointing that this establishment has such poor standards.",

Our waiter was really sweet and genuine and gave us excellent service. The blue cheese burger was phenomenal and perfectly cooked. I was still talking about my hamburger from Stripburger four days later- and that's saying a lot since I come from the beef capital of America. On the side, I had the threesome so I could try a little of everything. All of the sides were delicious, but the onion straws were the stand out for me. I ordered a margarita and it was great. Overall, a surprisingly excellent choice for lunch. I would definitely come back!",

I was never a fan of blue cheese until I tried this burger.  I'm telling you it is a must try.  After about my 10th burger I learned they use grass fed beef.  How 'bout that?    So now I take all my friends here when they come into town.  If they take my advice and order the blue cheese cheeseburger, they leave never looking at burgers the same way.    If you go during December or January they have $1 \"you call it\" drinks at the bar.   Ridiculous pre-game where even bums can buy rounds.    Amy tends bar like no other.  She greets you, learns your name and introduces you to others; she brings people together.   She is a huge reason that I appreciate this gem of an establishment.  She made me feel welcome from day one, later I discovered the blue cheese cheeseburger, but with such service I would frequent the place anyway.  All I can say is thank you Amy.",

    "text": "This is my favorit place to eat for under 20 bucks on the strip.   Before I lived in Vegas I came here for vaca and stayed at the Trump. I ended up eating here like 5 times over the course of 6 or 7 days. If I am not going to ball it up at a michelin star place, its pretty tough to beat strip burger.   It has a great location- right outside Fashion Show on the corner with the Wynn- good for people watching and sitting outside.   A few notes on the food  Sweet potato fries- amazing. They come dusted with a large grain sugar which is good in and of itself, but they also come with FRY SAUCE. For those of you who don't know, fry sauce is a mixture of BBQ sauce and manaise (or aoli) and is delicious. The fry sauce at SB is 10/10 and on the sweet potato fries is incredible. Other than the SP fries at Burgr (that come with a can of vanilla powdered sugar) there is nothing even close in Vegas that can compete with SB.  The Shakes- are VERY thick like a shake could be. Very good. But here is the little detail that pushes them over the edge into super amazing- I always get oreo shakes and at SB they give you a straw that is about 3x as wide as a regular straw so it never clogs with cookie pieces/you can just suck them right up. I have since seen this other places but when I first went to SB 8 years ago I was super impressed with this obviously simple innovation.  Guac- is very good. I assume it comes from El Segundo Sol (the mexican restaurant right next to SB that is owned by the same group but SUUUUUUCKS) and it is very good.   Chicken wings- these are often on special as an appetizer and are very good for a non dedicated wing place.   The Burgers  I generally get the southwest burger as my go to- it is awesome. The meat is always cooked right- never over cooked.  Other burgers I have enjoyed are the occasional \"little kid\" burger they have on special- it comes with like velveeta cheese on top etc. as you used to eat as a kid. The blue cheese burger is also pretty good. The Tuna burger has been a favorite of people I have been there with if you aren't into beef.",

Plus, $1.04 PBRs on tap to celebrate the 104 degree high temperature that day. Service was a bit spotty due to the packed crowd. The perfect burger on a near-perfect day with inexpensive ice cold beer. I'm glad I went back!",

There is plenty of outdoor seating, which makes it a prime spot for people watching and enjoying a sunny day. With music playing in the background, a good crowd, and an ice cold beer, it was the perfect afternoon spot.   I ordered the hickory chicken sandwich, which was just OK. The sauce was a little much. However, the chicken was cooked to perfection and was nice and juicy. I probably would have been better off with just a plain chicken sandwich, which my friend ordered and loved. We had a basket of fries, which were good and well seasoned.   While I enjoed a heineken, my friend had a chocolate shake, which he raved over. It was nice and thick, and apparently super tasty. I'll have to get one next time!  The server was friendly and on top of things, and our food arrived quickly. Overall it was a nice, casual place to grab a sandwich and fries. Definitely refreshing from all the overpriced restaurants in the hotels! And it's a great place to enjoy the people walking up and down the strip.",

I loved the fries more. Onion strings seem to just taste better on the burger. For drinks, we had shakes. Mine Vanilla, his Strawberry. The Strawberry is a must have!  We hope to come back again and try out their other burgers...  P.S. The burgers were pretty hefty and I think I only finished half of my burger. Took it home and ended up not eating it later.",

(the picture i see above looks nothing like the burger that was served to me... it looks way better then the picture)... I ordered the green chili burger, and it was so-so. I should have gone with the hickory burger b/c everyone else at the table loved theirs. The had a taste of the blue cheese one, and that was good too, but I'd personally prefer more of a blue cheese flavor since I'm a cheese lover, but if you like a light blue cheese flavor, then this is good for you.   What is really notable was the atomic cheese fries. OOoooh smothered in cheese and chopped jalapenos, it was spicey and tasty. It had plenty of cheese for each bite of fry and lots of jalapenos.",

Muahaha  My waiter was really nice up until he asked, \"So what are  you all up to today?\" We mentioned maybe a few places to drop by, and as all my friends at the table were originally from LV they said they were showing me around as I was from Cali and it's my first time there. He just shot a snare and went \"Oh, so are u going to go buck wild now out here? Are you going to leave your Las Vegas story, what happens here stays here?\" And honestly... I'm a REAL chill person, good intentions and fun vibes, not a hore in that manner. If he said it with a different tone, I would have had a good laugh, but no... he said it with a bad attitude like he hated people from the Bay Area. Wow. That was an experience to remember.

I was there with E.S, and E.S acted like a child by pushing this button that was located on the bar many times just to be annoying.  As for the name tag? C'mon E.S, you have to be kidding me...this review is low even for you.  Now for the review:  This place has great deals, and the waitress E.S mentioned was extremely friendly and she was joking around with him. My other friend and I came back two days in a row, and the waitress actually remembered us. She even bought my friend a drink for his birthday. In a big city like Vegas, it was good to see that some of the workers in Sin City were actually friendly. The people at the Stripburger were great, and the atmosphere is conducive for a great time.  My 2 friends and I were there for a few hours and drank a lot, and because of their late night happy hour, it was inexpensive. All together our bills added up to less than $25.   The Stripburger is located outside across from the Wynn and next to the fashion show mall. It also has a great outside view of the strip.  Unfortunately, the only food I ordered was the fries, but they were delicious, so I am sure the other food they had is just as great.  All in all, this joint was one of my favorite places on the strip. The prices are unbeatable and the staff is friendly. If I ever were to return to Las Vegas, I would be sure to come back to try some of their delicious food.  I would definitely recommend this place!!!",

It's been a while since I was here but I'll recall what I can. I do remember that I liked it quite a bit. It's a modest little joint with modern looking silver tables and chairs. Cute hostess--pretty much what you'd expect. I actually opted to try their seared ahi tuna burger, my friend went for their more traditional cheeseburger. They both came out really well. They got the sear just right on the ahi, served it in a flaky wheat bun and lathered it in mouthwatering guacamole that tasted quite fresh to me. My friends burger (which I had a few bites of) was juicy and cooked to order. We shared an order of fries, which were particuarly tasty. Much better than your average fast food burger joint fries (why do any of us still go to those places anyway??) as they had bits of skin still on them and were not excessively greasy. They served a cool, clean glass of lemonade (fresh squeezed I believe) which was quite refreshing given the weather at the time.  The service is decent, the view is nice and its kinda trendy but not the least bit formal-- I don't think you even need a shirt to eat here---and its conveniently located if you just woke up from a night of excessive partying. I enjoyed it and would certainly plan on going back here the next time an opportunity presents itself.",

I explained that I'd prefer to eat inside.This went back and forth. Almost just left.  She said it was a really nice night. UGH! I want to eat inside. Girl #3 said I could sit anywhere, I said I want to eat indoors, she said fine and took me to a table. Waiter was very friendly, nice and we discussed our favorite burgers around town. He said I was about to have one of the best burgers ever. He was wrong.   Had the bacon cheddar burger, rare and the Trio of fried pickle chips, fries and onion strings.  Burger looked great, tasted very good but a few problems. Patty was rare as ordered but also cold in middle which equals muted flavors and not juicy. Bun was a bit gummy on outside(under-baked?), under toasted and became very thin and smashed while eating. Didn't fall apart, but felt like I had to race it to end. Waiter said food was better when the executive chef was in. Too bad he wasn't .  Trio was lame, could have come from any deep frier along any interstate. Pickle chips were something salty in a heavy batter. Onion strings were bland, could have been cardboard. Fries were no better. All served with a small ramikin of thing ranch like dressing.",

The burgers are $11-$13, which in of itself is not terrible; however, the patties are 6 oz and do not come with a side (fries, etc). I didn't give the place four stars because our table ordered fried pickles which were really poor. A couple of were empty fried dough pockets with no pickles in them and the ones that had pickles were sliced like super-thin cucumbers. I brought this to the server's attention and showed him one of the empty pockets of dough. He basically shrugged and walked away. They were still on the bill at the end of the meal which I thought was a crappy way to handle the situation.  Now the burger was good. I had their bleu cheese selection which was tasty. Not the best burger I've ever had and based on the prices I wouldn't rush to go back.",

The waitress was very attentive and great service. I was disappointed with the food. Read reviews before coming here, so I was really looking to dine here. Started with the Caesar salad. Really nothing special, reminds me of a bag salad kit from the supermarket. I went with the burger sampler, blue cheese burger, cheddar cheese burger, and the whiskey BBQ burger. The meat was cooked to my liking, but salty. Maybe it was just off that day? Will give another try for their happy hour.",

Our table shared chicken wings for appetizer and we really enjoyed the bold but delicious flavors.  I had the blue cheese burger which was excellent, I loved the soft flavorful taste of the blue cheese on top of a huge juicy burger.  The sweet potato and regular fries was alright, it needed more of a crunchy texture.   It being my birthday, my sister ordered me a 32oz of Jeff & Tito's Shakin' Lemonade which was very strong; it had me buzzing halfway through. The waitress was friendly but wasn't as attentive with service. We had to ask for water refills. She did although reminded me that I could take my alcoholic beverage to go and gave me a to go cup which was a nice gesture.   We also had a 25% off coupon which really helped with the large bill that we had.  It is conveniently located outside of the Fashion Show Mall and you get a nice view of the Strip.",

I ended up trying the blue cheese burger and it was quite good. The meat was very well cooked, the bun was okay, and the blue cheese and other toppings were not overpowering but complimented the burger really well overall. Those fried onions on top also added quite a nice kick to the burger.  Overall a pretty good experience, with decent burgers for an okay price.",

Me and a buddy came here for the burgers first and foremost, but they have promotions frequently and I got one just a week before I was coming into town for a free milkshake with any purchase! That sold us along with the many positive reviews.   We ordered the mini burger sampler and the cookies n creme milkshake. The milkshake was the standout of the two for sure! Chunks of oreo in every bite. Usually in my experience you have to fish for the chunks, but in ours it was more than plentiful just the way we like it. The burgers weren't bad either, but since they were mini, it was probably difficult to cook these medium rare as we requested. They were still flavorful, and I would def recommend anyone to come here and try it for themselves at least for their shakes!",

The prices are relatively good for the amount of food and for Vegas standards.   The only reason I can't give the full 5 stars is the staff wasn't that friendly to me. I was by myself I'm in a tank top, going to EDC and tattoos I look like in my 20's they probably thought this kid is trying to steal from us or something I don't know. But the bartender didn't acknowledge me until I had to ask a passing waitress to get me a menu. then once he came over I put in my order, food comes out and no napkins were given, no check up on wether the food was good, no condiments. So a little disappointed but I'll try not sitting at the bar next time maybe the waiters are better.",

Especially with other food options so below average and so costly.. We customized the Whiskey Burger with the veggie patty and it was made to perfection Garlic fries are separately ordered and were huge.. Couldn't finish them between the two of us  Drinks are incredible. Spiked shakes and cocktails are made to perfection  The only catch is that this is only an outside patio sort of place, that can be inconvenient to some, but today worth it in my opinion. Overall, a must go on the strip.",

This spot is really close to the Encore and Wynn hotel where we stayed at and is really visible.  If you know where the Vegas fashion mall is then you will have no trouble finding this place.  So we rolled in here on a Sunday afternoon after shopping at the Fashion Mall, we climbed up the stairs and seated ourselves at the bar.  They asked if we wanted a table but the bar area is better as you can see the strip better.  Plus if you are going to eat at the Stripburger you might as well have a good view of the strip na-wha-mean!  So me and my boy ordered, he got the mushroom burger which is really big and lots and lots of mushrooms on it and I ordered the bar burgers which comes with 3 individual burger with chesse and veggies.  The bun here is really good in has a distinct taste to it and the burger patties here are really juicy and you can literally taste the juiciness of beef in almost every bite.  So if you are close by I really recommend this place if you are craving burger and a good view of the strip!",

The burger was really good, and the fries was good too. Our server was great! We told him how long for a quick meal, cause we had the show to go to, which was right outside of restaurant. He said less than 15-20 minutes. It came out super fast and was very tasty.

    "text": "The happy hour prices here are unbelievable!  After having a nice lunch at Maggiano's our waitress Heather recommended we check out Stripburger for drinks.  So, we figured why not and walked down. The patio was pretty busy but we found a nice four top.  When our server, Kayla explained their HH prices we all kinda did a double take.  \"Wait, what did you say?!?\" \"Drinks are how much?!?\"  TWO DOLLARS for well drinks and good beers?!?  DOLLAR 16 oz PBR's??        We also had two orders of fries, but not one of the four of us were impressed. They were too dark, greasy and smelled like old oil. You would think in the middle of happy hour we would have received some fresh cooked fries. I have no doubt that 99 percent of their customers are tourists due to the location. So, maybe management isn't thinking much about reviews or repeat customers. But remember, us locals are still out there in force and we love good food and great places when we go out. And we always tell our friends what we think.    Happy Hour is from 4pm-7pm and 11pm to close NIGHTLY!  This really has to be one of the best strip drink prices out there.",

Prices went up, competition grew fierce and it wasn't as convenient for me to frequent it so its been a long while since I've been.   My brother and I  were reminiscing and decided to grab dinner there tonight. I was pleased to see they still had the atomic fries on the menu. I recall them being delicious. They were still good, but I missed the heavy hand of jalapenos. These were pretty sparse. I ordered the jalapeno popper burger and he couldn't choose between the BBQ Whiskey burger or the Blue burger so he opted for the sampler of three sliders so he could try them both. He also got a shake since he used to love it. The burgers should have been prepared medium, they were medium well at best. The buns were dry, the meat crumbled. The fried cheese on my burger tasted like flour and grease. I pulled it off so it would be edible. His BBQ burger came with mayo and really threw off the flavor. At least, the shake was decent.  The waitress never asked how our meal was, but she was pretty prompt refilling drinks and taking our order. $40 later, we were wishing we went to In & Out and bought doubles for everyone in line. Money would have been better spent. It's a shame how bad this place has become.",

I'm huge on good customer service, this place was great. We chatted with one of the managers (Mark I believe...I'm awful with names) and he was so knowledgable...everything he recommended was great.  We enjoyed the patio and people-watching on the strip, even though it was chilly outside, we didn't mind  because the heaters cranked out some serious heat.   We started off with some triple sampler where we had garlic fries, onion strings and pickle fries. I was skeptic about the pickle fries, but dang they were good! We also has the bleu cheese burger. Super juicy and very filling...the onion strings were my favorite part. For drinks, we got a cocktail that was lemonade something...it's one of their signature drinks and it's indicated on the menu as one of their favorites.   Will definitely be back on a future visit to Vegas! Thank you, Strip Burger!",

I ordered a scotch and ginger ale.  Matt and his manager researched online whether it was gluten free because they wanted to make sure it was safe for me to drink.  I thought that was amazing.      I ordered the bacon cheeseburger w gluten free bun which was absolutely perfect.  Cheese fries were on the happy hour menu - so we ordered them as well.  The whole meal was really tasty and we felt we got an amazing value.      Great service was really the thing to write home about though.  We had the same great experience last year and I will go back each time I am here.",

The food was average and not something that I would go out of my way to eat again. The fried pickles were good; something you'd only be able to get at a fair or carnival. My only complaint about the dish was that the pickle slice wouldn't hold to the breading, so I was left with a chunk of fried breading after each bite. The big green salad was fresh and light. The croutons on the salad were house made and also very fresh. I enjoyed the lightness and acidity of the avocado dressing. My dining partner ordered a cheeseburger which was great in terms of flavor and presentation, but not comparable to my favorite LA spots. The cocktail was refreshing and well made as well.   The service was average for being on the strip. Our waitress was sweet and made a few recommendations on our orders. The ambience was also nice because even though we were technically sitting indoors, the view of the strip and the openness felt like I was sitting in an outdoor setting. Overall, good place to grab lunch if in the area but otherwise not something super memorable.",

    "text": "One of the best people watching patios in all of Vegas! At the North East corner of the Fashion Show Mall on Las Vegas Blvd. - it's across the street from the Wynn and Encore so there's a ton of foot traffic. No matter where you sit (it's all patio seating) you'll have a great view of Las Vegas's best!  This burger joint has become of favorite of ours when we're down on the strip because the food is good, the pricing is fair and the people watching is phenomenal!   We love to use <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> and this happens to be a newer addition to that site that sells out rather quickly each month. The nice thing is they restock the gift certificates at the beginning of each month so if you're on top of it you can snag one. They have both $10 and $25 gift certificates available. We purchased a $25 one.  We came down to the strip specifically to eat here. We parked just off the strip at Nordstroms and discovered that was quite a walk, however we discovered there's a parking lot for the mall right behind the restaurant so that will be good to know for next time.  There are so many tasty options here. My boyfriend ordered the Hickory Chicken Sandwich - $9.95, which was awesome! I ordered the Mini Burger Sampler which came with 3 sliders - the Blue Cheese Burger, The Jack Daniels Hickory Bacon Burger, and the Cheddar Burger - $10.95. All were tasty and I added bacon to each of them (for my boyfriends sake, since we end up sharing everything). As an appetizer we LOVE the fried pickles so we ordered the 'Threesome' as we usually do - a basket of Onion Rings, Fries & Pickle Fries - $6.95. This comes with a spicy dipping sauce similar to a spicy ranch, we also asked for a side of cheese sauce for the fries - it's like a melted cheese you'd put on nachos with green and red peppers in it. YUM!  Since we weren't worried about calories (this meal was all about taste), we also ordered a Fat Tire pint of beer - $5.75 and a Banana Milk Shake (heavenly)-  $4.95. We didn't come close to finishing even half of our food but wow was it good! We'll be back soon.  **Side note: they have Happy Hour daily in the bar area from 4-7pm and 11pm - close. $2 Coors Light, PBR & Bud Light drafts.**",

We were seated immediately and had a strip view while being cooled down by the mister system and promptly served our drinks. The staff was very friendly and prompt and was smiling.  I ordered the 'hickory bacon burger' which had a plethora of bacon on it topped with caramelized onions & hickory-smoked sauce for 8.95   She ordered the classic burger for a buck cheaper.   We started with the pickle fries which were very interesting. They are pickles that are battered with japanese breadcrumbs and fried served up with ranch dressing. The ranch was a little runny, i like mine thicker and the pickles were a little too deep fried for me.  Their burgers are served medium, I prefer mine medium rare and it came out medium anyways but it was so damn juicy it didn't bug me, the flavor was very good.   We finished off with the Tall Strawberry Cake -- ok about as expensive as the burger itself but it was pretty good. Probably wont order it again but to describe it was pound cake compacted and covered with a icing served with a strawberry topping, nice and fresh tasting... :)",

The prices here were very economical, happy hour was an option but we chose to order off the regular menu. Got us some chili cheese fries and a drink all for under $5, which is absolutely amazing for a decent restaurant right on the strip.   What did bother me about this place was the service. Not only were the waiting staff completely disinterested in their job, but even after we got the attention of a waiter, our food took 20 minutes to come out. So we waiting 15 minutes for someone to take our order, 20 minutes to get the food and then another 10 to get the check. Mind you, this was at 2 in the morning and we were one of maybe 3 tables that were being served at the time!",

    "text": "Yet another sh*tty experience with service at a strip restaurant...to begin with there was some sort of bicycle gang/show going on right in front of the entrance to the place, I had to squeeze up against one of these gangsta wannabes just to get in ...the hostess didn't seem to give a sh*t that these guys were basically blocking everything and sending the message all patrons go away, well it was my buddy's bday and he wanted to go to this place so get the f*ck out of our way.  So we get seated and start looking over the menu, some interesting burger choices, a la carte like the standard hipster \"gourmet\" burger joints...our waiter comes over and we order a water and coke...we get them about 10 minutes later and we put in our app order...my friend has an allergy to dairy and we were quite clear about that...so we start with the quac and chips...so while waiting for that my buddy tastes his coke and it is ultra weak, our waiter had dissapeared so we grab another waitress and tell her, she takes the soda and puts in on another table then asks what else he would like, he tells her Mr Pibb, so she then just goes off and works at other tables, meanwhile our waiter still AWOL...when he does come back we see the waitress tell him that the drink sucks and he then dissapears again for about 5 minutes with the Mr. Pibb (why the hell didn't she get us the replacement drink)...in the meantime we get our guac and guess what there is cojita cheese on top, this wasn't listed on the menu that way and of course we told the waiter no dairy !   WTF is wrong with these places, I wonder how many people die each year due to allergic reactions at restaurants i bet it would be surprising...and moreover why does guac need cheese?  So the guy who brought it out went straight back and got us a replacement, not our waiter a runner, so after another 10 minutes the waiter comes back and asks what we want to order for dinner, not saying anything about the mistakes, etc...so we order a couple of burgers...as he was going back the older couple near us flagged him down and said \"are we gonna have to wait as long as them to order\"   lol   He said \"of course not\" then he disappeared...we then waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out...place was about a quarter full...anyways the burgers were at least what we had ordered but wow very average and nothing gourmet about them, my burger was over cooked but again I was starving at this point so said f*ck it....meanwhile I notice the older couple near us still hasn't been able to order...geez...so we eat our burgers and the waiter doesn't return/ask how everything is until we are done then comes with the check...bottom line this place sucks, is way overpriced and the service is god awful !  Stay away...",

It was a 1/4 pounder with chedder, bbq sauce, and onion rings, the benefit of the special is that it comes with fries.  I plan on going back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I went ahead and ordered a veggie burger because their name is \"strip burger\" and I'm always on a hunt for delicious creative veggie burgers. Their veggie burger was not mushroom or soy based like the other ones but with brown rise, seeds, and nuts! It tasted kind of like potatos but it was very fulfilling. There were no unique sauce so i used the regular ketchup and mustard which is fine but I couldn't stop thinking how much High Fructose Corn Syrup I was putting into my mouth because most brand ketchup is filled with that crap. But the burger in general was good but nothing special.  I also ordered a \"three some\" which included fried pickles, fries, and onion fries. the onion fries were stringy, sweet and hard to eat but yummy. wish they were in my veggie burger! it would've been delicious with it! the fries were regular but good and my friend and i both enjoyed the deep fried pickles! a weird sensation of crunchy pickles. :D  I would definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch stop!",

    "text": "Overpriced burgers compared to your average Micky D's or Burger King, but hot damn, these are some HUGE ASS drop dead delish burgers! They promise to fufill you.  Came here last night with my manager while we were in Vegas to take care of some work stuff... LOVE the fact that they are open till 2 AM (full on bar service as well). The music was a little loud for my liking, it was kinda hard to hear what my manger was saying to me, and we were sitting together at the same table! But I loved the outdoor space, and the lively feeling from around the area. Had a super friendly waitress last night, she was full of suggestions, and let us take our time ordering. My burger was SO FREAKIN TALL it was not even funny... you have to smash your burger down if you want to eat it all in one bite. However, I felt that even though the top was beautifully rounded out and a nice golden brown color, the insides of the bun were not toasted, and I found that I didn't really like that. I ordered my patty rare... and yes, it came out pink and raw, just the way I like it... however, I felt that I hit a cold spot somewhere in the middle of my patty, like they didn't heat it enough? Fleeting thoughts of undercooked raw food poisoning flirted across my mind and I continued to munch on my humungo-dang-diggy-dang-de-dang-de-dang-diggy-diggy burger. A little after halfway across my burger, the juices from the raw meat pretty much infiltrated my paper that wrapped around my burger, and soggify-ed the whole bun to mush, pretty much. I ended up tossing the top of my burger bun to cut some carbs out of my diet, and grubbing on the food inside individually.  Manager and I also ordered a side of Atomic Fries... guess I was looking for more from the name. Kinda expected some BOMB chili-cheese-fries, but with a \"mouth-on-fire\" feeling. Didn't happen. We got a basket full of fresh, hot, oily fries slathered on top with a healthy dose of creamy nacho-esque cheese, sprinkled with some jalapeno peppers. WHAT?!?! Are you serious? Is that it?!?! Kinda disappointed...  But for sure, if you're hungry, the burger definitely hits the spot to help fill you up. Not sure if it's worth the $10 bucks paid for it... but I understand everything is overpriced on the strip, and frankly, I thought the burger was pretty good overall... I'll just order it medium, or well cooked next time.",

Sure, you could go to the food court, where a $3 Wendy's hamburger costs $5. You could go to Panda Express and get some Chinese-flavored food. Or, you could go outside and get something a lot better for just a little bit more. Stripburger's a small, upscale outdoor hamburger stand. It's waited service, and there's a full bar. Burgers will run you $6-$9, side dishes like fries will add another $3-$6. Definitely a good alternative if you're starving and don't want to drop a $20 on lunch. Unfortunately, the smallest order of fries will most likely be too much for one person, so bring a friend to share.",

Both the fiancee and I got the Bacon Burgers, an order of fries and chocolate milkshakes.  The burgers were good. Cooked a bit much, but the toppings were fresh, and it was served quickly. The fries were superb, cooked to perfection, and just all around delicious. The milkshake was by and far the highlight of the meal. I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate milkshake here, it's among the best I've had, and easily worth the $5 price tag, especially on a hot Vegas day.  The service overall was good. It took forever for our waitress to show up initially, but after that she quickly refilled our waters before we were even finished, and quickly took care of the check. All and all, a very positive experience, and while a bit pricey for a burger and shake, it's location and great tasting shake make up for it.",

    "text": "I went to Vegas for the first time this past weekend and I had heard good things about this restaurant. It was a toss-up between here and Burger Bar, but I went with this one.  I sat at the bar and ordered the Southwest Burger because I wanted the chipotle mayo. It's toppings were listed as pepper jack cheese and chipotle mayo. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and an Orange Whip alcoholic beverage.   The burger was mediocre at best. I didn't taste any Southwestern flavors and the cheese was bland as well. The chipotle mayo was good, but the flavor was not strong enough, which is the reason I got the burger in the first place. There was nothing spectacular about the burger whatsoever. I could've had a V8, as the commercial goes. However, the sweet potato fries were to die for! I loved them and couldn't stop eating them and had I known better, would have just ordered an order of those and skipped the burger. They were hot, sweet potato-y and had salt (sea salt or other large-grain salt) on them. The salt was almost too much....almost. They came with this BBQ-like sauce that complemented them so well. Yumm! I'm having flashbacks! The Orange Whip beverage had a great taste, but a little more alcohol would've ramped it up tremendously. It's also pretty pricey. I had a burger, sweet potato fries and a 16 oz. alcoholic beverage for $28, not exactly cheap and not worth it either!  The service was not great. I sat at the bar, the bartender took my order, someone else brought out my food and the bartender didn't ask me about another thing until she saw my napkin on the plate and then gave me the check. I'm sure they're not that concerned with the service with where it's located, but the service could have been much better.   The only reason I gave this restaurant two stars was for the sweet potato fries. Those were the only redeeming qualities of this experience. I only ever go back for the fries and skip the burger.",

    "text": "I recently returned from a long weekend in Vegas with six of my best girlfriends.  Aged 24-25, we were anticipating a REALLY wild weekend full of hot people, and hot clubs... hot music, hot gambling, great food, great drinks.... and guess what, we were disappointed.  Despite my disillusionment  with Las Vegas as a bona fide Disneyland for adults (more like Wally World, I think) I have at least one good thing to bring away from my trip that I can recommend to other travelers, locals, or disillusioned 25 year old women:  Stripburger.  There are a few reasons that I decided to give a little place like Stripburger in Las Vegas five stars:   1) Location.  Stripburger was right across from our hotel, on the ground level.  Easy access from the street, with patio seating to people watch on the Vegas strip.   2) GREAT HAPPY HOUR.  We actually had food and drinks NOT during happy hour, and it was good.  But the happy hour was really great.  Not only is it 4-7 pm EVERY DAY (yes, including Sat/Sun), but they have a straight across $2 menu that includes drinks and food.  I have to recommend the margaritas, which are a good size for the money, and which taste like margaritas, not a melted lemon-lime Otter pop.  Very cheap and fun way to party before heading out for the night.   3) Service was great.  Our lunch waitress and our happy hour staff were all amazing, friendly and attentive.  For a large group of boisterous, hungry/thirsty women, Stripburger definitely fit the bill.",

Stripburger is a smoke free environment which is a nice change from the smoky atmosphere of the strip. This place gets bonus points for having a great veggie burger. My wife is a vegetarian and is pretty picky when it comes to eating restaurant veggie burgers. I have never seen her clean her plate so fast! She stated it was the best burger she's had. The portions are huge, which brings me to the fries. We each ordered our own and couldn't finish them because one is enough to feed two people. These fries are not your typical fries. I could've eaten those alone and been happy. They are definitely gourmet. We ordered the sweet potato fries and the garlic and herb... Oh my goodness!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I hate to say it but the meal I had here was better then the one I had at \"Burgr\" the next day. Let me not forget to mention their delicious thick shakes because you want to leave room for those! We had a great experience here! Very friendly and patient staff, and out of this world food! This will be a regular stop for us from now on.",

Smashburger is so much better, or better yet just stick to the classic In-n-Out. But if you're on the strip, want some drinks, and don't mind paying $10 for an average burger, then go for it.",

    "text": "OK... I heard this place was really good and the reviews were good as well but...    I ordered the hickory bacon and the famous blue cheese burgers with the 1/2 onion rings and fries plus a vanilla milk shake.  Fries were mediocre but the onion rings were better than the fries.  The Bacon burger was good. but the Blue cheese burger was not as good as thought it would be (and I like blue cheese, so it's not about the cheese).  The Milk shake was nothing spectacular either.  I tried to order the \"seasonal\" Sam Adams listed on the menu but all they had was the regular Lager.  Got the Pale Ale on draft instead.  Total Check + Tip came out to be $57 for 2 ppl.   I was a bit surprised to find the restaurant was all outdoors.  It was Hot even with the misters and the shade.  It's Vegas after all.  I just felt bad for the workers there w/ the long sleeves.  The music was loud but not as loud as the traffic noise from the strip and the other street next to the Mall.      Service was good and really attentive.  big plus.  I don't think I would go back for the food and considering the price it's not worth it.",

Staff were great, really helpful and friendly. One advised us to share fries as we were gonna get one each and Im glad she gave us the heads up - the amount we got was immense! No way could we finish the burger and the friesI also tried one of their shakes - it was huge and very very tasty.   If youre going to Vegas and youre in the mood of a good quality burger - get your ass in here pronto! I totally loved the lay out and decor, casual and not too in your face, great for chilling. And a brilliant place to people watch as well, good to sit and watch all the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  We will be making a return visit when we're next in Vegas :D",

It is located on the outside of the Fashion Show Mall.  The restaurant is outdoor seating but very comfortable even in 105 degree heat.  The misters and a breeze keep it very comfortable.    We had eight people in our party and were seated immediately.  The specialty is their bleu cheese burger which 3 of us ordered and subsituted the regular burger for a veggie pattie.  It was very delicious.  The others said their regular burgers were great as well.  The burgers don't come with fries but a basket is more than enough for three and the sweet potato fries were great.  The onion rings were huge and delicious.  We also had the fried pickles which were very tasty.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about how much to order and what ingredients were included in the burger.  Substiutions were no problem.  I really enjoyed the visit here and will probably go again if visting Vegas in the future.",

Our waitress took our order and brought us our drinks and NEVER returned! 1 hour later our food was still not at our our table. The manager came over and finally told us that there was some glitch in the system and the kitchen never got our order! Note: even after the \"manager\" came over our waitress still never came by to apologize, re fill our drinks or even said \"hello\". He then said that our meal would be on the house and we wouldn't have to pay for anything....ok, great....but.......another 30 minutes later....still nothing (not even our waitress!!). Finally we had enough we tried to wave her and the manager down, but they seemed to be ignoring us. My husband had it....he approached the \"manager\" and asked him what was going on. He went to check on the food. By then we were over it. We decided to leave and as we were leaving, our food came. We still left.  What was funny was that it wasn't even that busy, she was helping other tables but ours and the table next to us (party of 6) came after us and left before us!!! WTF??!! The manager was full of crap! We didn't care that the meal was free. Take care of your customers regardless!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!",

We always get Sweet Potato Fries & Fried Pickles too! Being from CA we have have lots of these kinda restaurants but the Vegas joint takes the cake! Love It! Great location for people watching, all the staff rocks everytime, food is great, fans, misters, heaters everything for every season!!! I was a lil nervous the first time I order the giant jack and coke but they actually put lots of liquor in it & all of the drinks as i came to find out... very uncommon for a restaurant!!!! The Mojitos are great too! All the drinks & food are average \"non vegas\" restauarant prices. $10 burgers $8-10 Mixed Drinks & Giant Sized Drinks for a lil more money but they are totally worth it! Oh ya and they have TO GO CUPS!!! I have forced so many people to try this spot while we were in vegas and many said \"A burger joint when there is so much to choose from?\" but every single person has told me that the next time they were in Vegas without me they went back!!! Oh & it has a huge FREEEEE garage parking located just behind it. Its a great way to start your trip after a long car ride or a perfect place to eat before that long car ride. Or for a fun lunch/dinner on the strip with lots of people watching!",

We arrived at the strip around 6 ish and believe it or not we still found a quick parking space at the Fashon Show Mall, which is not easy usually. I ordered the beer mojito, it was different. I wouldn't order it again eventhough I'm a fan of beer, check, fan of lime, check and mint, check, but just not all together. I also went with the famous Blue Cheese burger. Maybe I was imagining RedRobins Blue Ribbon but this while being good wasnt what I'd call world famous. If I had it to do over again I'd ordered it without the tomato which became soggy with the juice from the meat. and without the onion straws which too became soggy. yuck. I pulled them out and ate what I could. Now for the GARLIC FRIES, YUM! too full however to even put a dent into them, and sadly you just can't reheat fries. Plus who wants to walk around with a doggy bag up & down the strip?   MY bf went with the southwest burger - NOT on the menu. chipotle mayo, bacon and pepperjack cheese. He loves anything with heat but he still had to add tabasco so its not hot at all. and he went w/ the cheese fries.also delish. Had we known the fry buckets were so big we would have shared and still not finished  them by half!  Its a pretty good place, chilled out relaxed atmosphere. cool location b/c its one of those outdoor only places and the weather was perfect. I'd go back.  :) but i cant wait to try el segundo sol its attached to - awesome vibe indoors, kinda reminded me of san antonio a lil bit. (ah the best city in the world!)  and Maggiano's. I've heard good things and those 2 are bookmarked nxt!",

    "text": "Sometimes a guy just wants a good burger. Simple aspects: nothing fancy, no extras, and never a long wait. And in the competitive burger environment that is the Las Vegas Strip, Stripburger is one of those places. Whether you have a larger party after a long night (or morning) of Las Vegas shenanigans, or you have brought the wee ones to your \"work conference\", or you simple need a #table4two and a good meal, Stripburger is the answer.  Las Vegas will always be famous for its people watching. Stripburger is no different. Perched on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show, patrons get the walking traffic coming and leaving the mall area, the trickling down from older Las Vegas, and the usually enthusiastic crowds from the Wynn and Encore resorts. Entertainment like this is not always necessary but a welcome feature. They have outdoor dining, which is fun. The misters run throughout the day, and that corner gets a good amount of shade to deal with the desert sun.   The burgers itself are delicious. Raging steadily from $9-$11, the burgers are a good portion and have varied ingredients including melted mushrooms, chipotle mayo, and Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I usually order the Blue Cheese Burger and add bacon. Yes, I cheat by adding the bacon, but do you blame me? The Mushroom Cheddar Burger and the Whiskey BBQ Burger are also hits at our table.   But Stripburger gets underestimated with their sides ($5-$8). Their garlic herb fries, sweet potato fries, and the garlic strings are appetizing. I order mine extra crispy. They even do a threesome which combines a couple choices and some pickle fries. The milkshakes ($5) are very good as well, although a little on the thicker side. But as other reviewers have mentioned, its consistency is due to the Las Vegas heat. It melts just a tad bit slower. The butterscotch and the banana shakes are my personal favorite. Go to those if you have a sweet craving.  Because of the size of the Las Vegas Strip, most food choices are made on convenience. But I advise that you make a trip to Stripburger in the Fashion Show Mall. Its ambiance, affordable Strip prices, and darn good food make it a crowd pleaser and go-to stop from visitors and locals alike.",

After calling a dozen restaurants in Las Vegas we finally found this place which was open till midnight, thankfully. We arrived at 8pm with a party of 3 and we were seated immediately.  Our server was terrible to put it politely. Took her ~8mins to come introduce herself to our table. Also we had to steal utensils from the table across from us because she only brought enough for two people. Not sure if she was just having a bad day but she came across as very uninterested, hurried, and unhospitable.   I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger and it was served on a small appetizer plate. The burger had an artificial taste to it, the breaking on the patty was also very soggy halfway through the burger. Also what disappointed me the most was the bread! My burger was so soggy that the bottom half of my bun was thinner than a pancake, literally.  I argued with my cousins for about 5 minutes complaining how I didn't get a bottom bun to my burger, but sure enough once I began eating it was under all of the excess ingredients in my plate. My cousins thought it was a tomato at first, lol. (See picture for my pancake bun)   Overall, I would give this place 2 stars. Service: 2/5, Food Quality: 2/5, Atmosphere: 3/5  Tip: Probably the cheapest meal on the strip you will find... 3 of us ordered burgers and the tab was $35.",

Quite pricey for burgers but is still reasonable compared to other restaurants in Las Vegas. The staffs are all very friendly, they came to check on us every now and then and never pressured to hurry us on ordering from their menu.  My favourite was their Sweet Potato Fries which was around $5. So good on its own, but the dip is also really good, plus the portion is satisfying. Their burgers - again - are alright and not greasy ( which i like), but my favourite is the whiskey barbecue burger. One thing i love about it is their sweet sauce, and that their onions are crispy and nice.   Overall good for late night snacks or dinner, but ill have to turn down 1 star because of its price and ok taste for their other burgers.",

The Mexican Burger (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg?userid=GEkww4CD1di7LZkNvoayJw#WcBcfNdU40upDbQl6fVq8A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pLMP...</a>): chipotle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapeno, cojita cheese, & cilantro is a mouthful of juicy, greasy deliciousness. It was so good I had to eat it all = stomach bulge. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg?userid=GEkww4CD1di7LZkNvoayJw#4fvxHeAVKx8-vJUmZvS2gQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pLMP...</a>)  Their fries were fresh and hot, hot where it burns your fingers and you try to throw it in your mouth and eat it as fast as you can so you won't feel the hotness anymore.  $2 Bud Light? Hey I'll take it since the next joint a beer will easily cost $8!   Beer & burger, what else is there?",

I ordered the sample trio burgers. 3 different mini burgers, figuring this will really allow me to try their different burgers. It had the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger and the cheddar burger. The whiskey burger was amazing I will get that again. The cheddar burger was good, nothing extra special but if you like a good basic burger then you will love this. Then blue cheese was okay, now I'll be honest I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese so that might be why. Over all the burgers we good. My husband got the \"Mexican burger\" he forgot the name. He said it was good and he would get it again. We also ordered the garlic fries and they were good just very garlicy. (Dah I know) I picked out some of the less seasoned ones and they were good. We also got beer because it was happy hour (4pm-7pm) $3-$4 beers. Over all the experience was good and we will be back. The waiter wasn't the best. He took our orders quick, checked in on us and the food was all correct he just had no personality. We still tipped well because of good service and good food but in this industry you need to fake a smile for tips sometimes.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Stripburger. Overall, it was a great experience. 5 stars for food, minus 1 star for value.   I ordered the mini burger sampler with the blue cheese burger, the whisky bbq burger and the cheddar burger. The bf and I split the strings & fries, and I got a margarita.   Burgers: Delicious! I ordered them cooked medium well, but I couldn't tell the difference between mine and my bf's, who ordered his medium... But that was ok. They were definitely juicy and flavorful! The bun is slightly sweet, and the blue cheese is more of a spread-- but was very tasty and added just the right amount of kick. The tomatoes were diced, which was an added bonus (I really don't like the gooey seed part of the tomato!)  Strings & Fries: Both were delicious. I favored the strings, but I'm glad we got both, they balanced each other out well.   Margarita: One of the best I've had in a LONG time! I'd rate it pretty strong, but definitely very tasty.   Ambiance: This is an outdoor/open air restaurant, and we visited at night (on the 4th of July) so the strip was hopping. It was also fairly warm 93 at 11:30pm, but the temp felt great with the fans running. I'd recommend an evening visit--the lights from the strip were great, and the heat wasn't as bad as it could be.   Value: This is where I take it down to 4 stars. I'd say it's a little spendier than similar burger places, with the fries being ala carte. But we had a deal from travel zoo, which made it super affordable! Check out the deal if still available-- 2 people each get an entree, 1 side and 2 drinks each for 1/2 price. The bf even got a vanilla shake (which was exceptionally great!)",

Once we walked up, the bartender got the heater lamps turned on & I was surprised at how many people were out, but it is also attached to the Fashion Show mall.  Great atmosphere bar w/ TV's & a view of the Wynn, their new construction 2.27.17 & traffic.    To start I had the Roasted Turkey Chopped Salad $10.95 w/ a glass of Chardonnay.  It had blue cheese, date-glazed bacon, apples, grapes, avocado, chunks of cheddar & some very salty roasted turkey.  I ate the cheddar separately cause it went better w/ the wine.  The avocado, green apples & grapes I thought would cut the salt, but it didn't.  I would not recommend this unless they replaced the salty turkey, otherwise it would've been a fantastic salad.   For our lunch entree we had the Mini Burger Sampler $11.95 which included a nice variety... the Blue Cheese Burger was good & moist, the Whiskey BBQ Burger was also nice, both had fried onion strings.  The Cheddar Burger we ordered w/ veggies on the side & all three mini burgers we had were well-done, perfectly & juicy!  After trying these three, I would recommend the Famous Blue Cheese Burger!  Also the sweet potato fries $5.95 were tasty & crispy, not soggy w/ a great sauce.    I will be back to try the fire coffee, vodka shake & sriracha fries all on the Specials Menu.  Also since I love spicy, the Mexican Burger... Yum!    I would give them another chance & I recommend to get the Lettuce Entertain You card.  If it wasn't for them, I may not have thought of coming to the strip today cause they send you coupons for both El Segundo & Stripburger.",

Burgers were cooked just as ordered and taste was great.   The one drawback for me is the price.

    "text": "Review 2 (update): Manager reached out. We've been able to order a side salad ILO fries since last review and that made the experience perfect. Much happier now - thank you! :)  Review 1: Great burgers...my kiddo orders the beef, I opt for the veggie burger mexi style.  HOWEVER, the fries and onion strings are horrible. Onion strings are salty and greasy to the point of inedible; truly gross. Sweet potato fries are over seasoned with salt and sugar to the point of not being able to taste what the heck you're eating. If you must order any of the fries (including the regular potato ones) make sure you order them completely unseasoned.....actually....never mind, just don't order them. Bottom line, burgers are great but they come with the fries which makes the whole meal not worth it for $14 per burger. Nothing to substitute with. Too bad.",

Decided to come here for a late night dinner, but we arrived at 11:30 p.m. and they closed at 12:00 a.m. So, we decided to get it to go.  We went with a classic cheeseburger, but they seemed to have gave us a bacon cheeseburger, regular fries and garlic herb fries. Walking back to the hotel and we got a whiff of the garlic herb fries and it smelled amazing. Even strangers next to us were enjoying the smell.  Well, the burger was good, but would have been better eaten at the restaurant. I'll pass on the regular fries, but those garlic herb fries were very good.  Will definitely go back and eat in next time. Would like to try a different burger and one of those spiked milkshakes.",

I came on Sunday evening this past weekend after dayclub, so perhaps it was because people were piling in from the venue?  When our food came out, I noticed my friend's food didn't have the mushroom that the mushroom cheddar burger should have...I mentioned this to our waitress so she went back and remedied the situation by bringing out a plate of sauteed mushrooms...The wagyu burger I got didn't consist of any outstanding flavors, unfortunately.  Nothing about it was really memorable.  I did appreciate the kind manager that showed me the way out to my uber, and how apologetic our waitress was.  I probably just caught them during an off moment.",

There was plenty of room for the two of us and our baby in his stroller (although I was surprised they insisted on sitting us up some stairs...).   It was Happy Hour (4p-7p) and they offer $2 sliders and a mini portion of fries. But we were hungry for more than just done nibbles, so we passed on those items. Instead we opted to share the Mushroom Cheddar Burger (with added bacon), the Roasted Turkey Salad and an order of sweet potato fries with cheddar on top. Oddly enough, the burger was the most disappointing part of our meal. Even with the toppings it had absolutely no flavor. However, both the salad and fries were fantastic! The salad was roughly chopped and had huge chunks of everything - turkey, cheddar, bleu cheese, date glazed bacon, grapes, apples, avocado and lettuce. The sweet potato fries were covered in a cheese sauce as well as cheddar cheese. There was a enough cheese that every fry and every bite had flavor.   Our server was great! She was attentive and friendly. And when my extra burger topping didn't come out in our plate, she brought it out right away and didn't charge us for it.",

It's right on the strip (outside only entrance from the Fashion Show Mall) and across the street from the Wynn.  Great location.  Started with 2 shakes: -Strawberry Shake: husband got this.  He loved it. -Cookies n' Cream Shake- delicious!  so good!  Main Order: -Blue Cheese Burger: I think this what they are know for.  My husband LOVED it.  He said it was probably the best burger he has ever had. (and that is saying alot!) He said it was cooked perfect (medium) and he said the blue cheese with the onion straws were perfect.  Not too much and it was blue cheese crumbles, that melt onto the burger. (when you go to their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flasvegasstripburger.com&s=8757335b99aa5c47d9ed8d9df7da922db75c7b48a5af51b5b5fac3700a2e201f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lasvegasstripburger.com</a>, the burger is the picture they have on there) -Veggie Burger: the best I have ever had!  Very moist, almost fell apart, but oh so good!  I would definitely get it again! -Fries: Their fries are enough for like 3 people.  They are really good!  You can tell they cut them in-house, with the skin on.  They taste really great!  Just a great place to go and hang out.  During the spring/summer I am sure this place is SLAMMED!  It was a 60 degree day yesterday and they were busy.  Can't wait to go back and have some drinks too!  OH!  There \"slogan\" is \"Burgers, Shakes & Cakes\".  They have \"baby\" cakes.  Next time I am going to HAVE to try their cake.  They sounded really good!",

It was scorching hot outside yet we of course still wanted to sit outside which ended up working out perfectly because they had lots of fans and water spraying lightly which felt great!   The service was really good, but it was also really slow. The burger was great, but I loved the fries more. We shared the Jalapeno cheese fries and if you like spicy it was so good! I would have to say by far the best burger place in Las Vegas and its quick and easy, you really can't go wrong.",

    "text": "Chalk another one up for Yelp. My wife and I were craving for burgers and found this place searching on my BlackBerry (now I know why they call these things \"crackberry\"). We stopped to check out the menu, but when we heard about the $2 happy hour specials, we were sold.   We sat outside along the bar, and while it was chilly outside, those heat lamps made it nice and toasty. Not much of a view of the strip at the corner of the Fashion Mall, but we did some people watching across the street from the Wynn hotel. We ordered a couple cheeseburgers and hamburger sliders each, along with some fries. The wait seemed to take forever, especially for such little-sized burgers. But when the food did arrive, we devoured those little suckers pretty fast.   The burgers were tasty and juicy, a great deal at a couple bucks each. I also thought that the $8-9 price for one of their regular sized burgers wasn't too shabby either, considering it is Vegas. All in all, a good place to go if you don't want to either spend a ton of money at a sit-down restaurant or eat hot dogs on a stick with the teenage crowd at the food court upstairs.   6 mini burgers, 1 order of fries, and 2 beers for around $20. Less money out of my wallet = more money for gambling. Or in my wife's case, more money for shopping.",

After the server made a rookie mistake of giving us the check for the wrong table and spending about 20 minutes trying to figure what went wrong, we decided we had enough and asked for a manager which ended up being not a great idea.  All he did was defend the mistake and keep us even longer, and at no point did he apologized or tried to make amends.  It probably doesn't mean much to them, but as a frequent customer and a business owner myself, that is NOT how a business should be run. Embarrassing for you, Stripburger, and you are not the only burger joint in Vegas, so moving forward you will NEVER see another dollar from my wallet.....",

Not to worry, they've got cooling mists in summer and heaters in winter. I took my parents here numerous times, had my birthday here and recently recommended the place to a couple of friends from Vancouver. They all loved the selection of pipe-in club hits and the overall atmosphere.  Foodwise, since I'm not a heavy eater, I usually opt for the 3 mini-burgers medium well with a side of their sampler (onion curls, fries and pickes) It doesn't sound a lot but it gets its job done and I always leave the place stuffed. Their shakes aren't bad, they aren't great either. The menu says you could add about $2 for a shot of alcohol so if you're feeling a lil' adventurous, you could try it. Burger quality can be compared to In-N-Out so if you do visit the place, try getting something different like the mexican burger per say or their vegan choices which my friends said weren't bad.",

It contained fresh mint, fresh blackberries, pineapple juice, and pineapple-vanilla vodka.  Oh god, it was so refreshing after a long walk.  My friend ordered a regular cheeseburger.  From his reaction, I can guess it was just your average cheeseburger, nothing extremely special.    My boyfriend ordered some kind of orange martini.  I tried it and it was delicious too.  I  remember drinking it and thinking of the summer time in my childhood when I ate orange creamsicles from the ice cream man.    It had a cool atmosphere and good drinks.",

Going to opt out of the fried pickles next time. Batter was too thick, so I had to peel off one side of batter..essentially I was eating an open-faced fried pickle.   The grilled cheese sandwich was good, came on thick toast with oozing cheese. I liked the jalapeno poppper burger. It isn't as heavy as it might sound with its fried cheddar cheese, date glazed bacon and jalapeno. Then again, I only took a bite.    I would come back because sometimes you just don't want fast food or a fancy meal...you want something in between..ya know?",

Was very juicy with a nice kick from the chipotle mayo.The patty was cooked to a perfect medium upon request.All the usual suspects were there and fresh....lettuce,toms,onions,etc. The bun was very soft and fresh as well but not toasted which is a peeve of mine.If you don't eat it rather fast it will get soggy like my wife's did cause she took her time with it but I tore mine up quick so no biggie!  The onion string fries were killer...sliced very thin and fried perfectly ...not greezy at all! Definitely worth checking out if your on that end of the strip or at fashion island mall.",

It had apples, avocado, blue cheese, apple wood smoked bacon, and nice chunks of cheddar cheese. I did have ranch on it which I didn't think was too tasty it was kinda watery and I like it creamy and thicker but I would for sure eat it again. I'm not a burger fan so it is important that I find a decent salad on a menu at a place like this because my hubby is a carnivore and loves places like this. My hubby had the \"Green Chili Cheeseburger\" and said he wished it had more green chilies but he did enjoy it and would just order more chilies on it next time. We also shared an order of \"Atomic Cheese Fries\" which is fries with cheese and jalapenos on it. The fries were fresh cut and delicious. I had water and he had a coke. Our total for all that was $30.35.  The server was very friendly and checked on us often. We sat on the patio and had such a nice view of the strip. I will say they had music playing that was just too loud. We could not hear each other talk sometimes. Give it a try if you haven't! They have deals on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> however those go quick so keep your eye out.",

    "text": "Back on the Stripburger bandwagon after the bad experience last time. It was freezing outside so we walked past the host stand and headed inside. A server caught us and said we couldn't sit at the Stripburger inside dining area. She hesitated a bit and then took us over to the El Segundo side.   We sat for a little while and she disappeared. I gather she was figuring out what to do with life, not sure, but she reappeared about 5 minutes later and asked about drinks and our order shortly thereafter. I don't expect to be seated and asked what we want to order and drink immediately, but there is something to be said about a server that shows up to a table within 1 minute of you being seated, especially since she was the one that sat us. I must admit the service has been consistently lacking lately, even the food has been coming out a little tardy. Not sure what the issue is, but they need to get it together.  Anyway, the Mexican burger was juicy and the garlic herb fries were good.",

I ordered the Blue cheese burger and truffle fries and it was absolutely delicious! But the service was absolutely terrible, we ordered drinks and our drinks were served about a minute before the food arrived so after 20 and some change minutes we were irritated. I also asked the waitress for ranch when she actually decided to stop by our table but before hand i asked the bus boy as well even though that is not his job, because of the fact the waitress was sort of non existent. I will definitely avoid being served by her next time.",

Ordered there FAMOUS bleu cheese burger, chili dog, and an order of garlic fries. We ordered the burger in med-rare  (onion strings on the side). Bread came out very soggy. We asked the waiter if we could get a new bun. They gave us the same burger on a new bun. burger was more of a medium-well to say the least.  The Chilli Dog was cold, skin was wrinkled and cold. Didn't have a snap or anything. chili was bland to say the least.   its really was terrible eating experience",

    "text": "Burger crew meeting called to order on Sunday, May 22, 2016 at 11:45am (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash).   Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Trevor and I ordered the Whiskey BBQ Burger - fried onion strings, cheddar, bbq sauce infused with jack daniel's ($10.95). We also ordered their special fries: spicy cheese curd fries - hand cut fries, crispy fried cheese curds, sriracha mayo, chopped parsley ($5.95). Dennis ordered the Mexican Burger - chipotle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapeno, cotija & jack cheese, and cilantro ($10.95). Sumana and Wayne both ordered one of the burgers on the specials menu: brie, bacon & fried egg burger - bigger than a 14 pounder, melted brie, fried egg, date glazed bacon, hand cut fries ($10.95). We all ordered our burgers medium rare, but the waitress warned Wayne and Sumana that since their patties are smaller, they may come out more medium than medium rare.  II. The burgers The burgers had nice squishy buns that were a little sweet, which complemented the patties well. For me, there was a little too much bun. The meat to bread ratio was a little bread heavy. The burger patty was uneventful. On the menu it says the patties are made with \"our secret recipe of prime cuts of beef, but the patties were a little dry and not very meaty. There was no sear to speak up, but there was some black pepper on the patties. The meat definitely wasn't the star of these burgers. The toppings took the spotlight.   Trev and I ordered the Whiskey BBQ burger, which in addition to the toppings described above also came with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayo. It was a little strange for me to have mayo on a BBQ burger, but Trev loved it. The onion strings got lost in the shuffle, which is weird because when I ate one on its own, it had some pow factor. We also got a side of extra pickles, which rocked!  Dennis got the Mexican burger and he was worried the cilantro would overpower everything, but it didn't. He said it was a good fusion burger and all the flavors worked together.  Sumana and Wayne got the brie, bacon and egg burger. It's weird that they went with a smaller patty on the special burger. The bacon was good, but they didn't really taste the brie. The eggs were cooked over hard, which kind of sucks because it's fun to have the yolk explode everywhere. To be fair, we didn't ask for it over easy. Maybe that was our bad.  III. The fries The fries have the skin on. They were pretty good! Not too potatoey, but nice and chewy. They could use a tad more salt. The special fries were pretty good, but could use more cheese curds. The sauce was really yummy!  IV. Miscellaneous Stripburger is located at the Fashion Show Mall. It's all outdoor seating, but they seem to have heaters for when it's cold and fans for when it's hot. The seating is nice and spacious. Since it's located on the corner right next to the street, you get a lot of noise from the cars racing by. It was a little distracting.   Our server, Natalie, was very nice. They accidentally brought our special fries to another table that had the audacity to eat them! So they put in another order and brought it out to us asap. Since it was a mix up, they gave us the fries for free. Natalie was very apologetic and the manager came by to apologize to us as well.   When we got the bill, they had automatically split it for us, which was really nice. They also had an automatic gratuity of 18% added. Not sure if it was because we were a bigger party or if it's standard practice.   V. Value The special was a good value since it came with fries, but for the other burgers the value isn't there. These are not worth $11.  VI. The verdict It was alright. It definitely needs more meat flavor! The ratings: 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.3.  Next burger crew meeting: June 21, 2016 at 7pm. Location: TBD (Trev's choice) Bye, Vegas! It was a crazy weekend!",

Thankfully, this place was open and on the way back so we wouldn't be subject to the lame options at our hotel. We got some food to-go, and though its neighboring restaurant Segundo was closed, we got to order off their menu, which was great because everyone wanted nacho fries. We also got a side of garlic parmesan fries that came from the Stripburger menu, to share.   it didn't take terribly long to get our food, which was nice, and we waited to get back to the room before eating. It was kind of a bummer how small the nacho fries were for how much they cost (around $15). Also, we were all hungry so we ate, but we all agreed that the taste was mediocre. We know our nacho fries. The garlic parmesan fries were good though!   Their biggest draw is that they're open and in plain sight while walking the strip late at night. Other people seem to be raving about the dining-in experience and burgers, so maybe that is worth trying. But, it's not on our must-return list.",

    "text": "Lettuce Entertain You sent me some coupons for 5 of their restaurants in town and Stripburger was the last of them that I had never been to.  Today, I stopped in for lunch/dinner.  I opted to sit at the bar and chat with Rebecca, the bar keep and my server.  She got me an iced tea while I looked at the menu.  Good server, very pleasant woman!  I had looked at the menu online and was all set to order the burger I had chosen when I did a switch and went with the mini burger sampler.  This consists of three sliders--the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger, and the cheddar burger.   I asked for the burgers to be done rare and they were.  That was a bit surprising because of their smaller size.  They cooked them the way they should.  With the burger, I got an order of garlic, herb fries which was large enough to feed me and the two other people at the bar.  While waiting, I enjoyed the people watching which is a big draw for this place.  Being on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive and with all seating being patio seating, it's a great place if you just want to have a drink and watch the tourists go by.    Of the burger sampler, I liked the blue cheese and the whiskey BBQ the best.  All three were good, but these two were better.  The fries were excellent.  So much garlic, good herb seasoning, and lots of salt on my part and I was set.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.  I'd bring my wife here sometime if it wasn't so difficult to get to.  It is outside at the farthest corner of Fashion Show Mall.  Maybe I'll just go back myself.",

Finally we had a suitable group assembled to take advantage of the discount.  And, an awesome dinner we all had!  All components of a Threesome appetizer of Onion Strings, Fries, and Pickle Fries, along with crunchy battered Onion Rings and Cheddar Fries slathered with Cheddar Cheese sauce, were delicious, for a very fine start.  Then my Bacon & Cheddar Burger arrived medium rare as ordered, with about a 1/3 pound beef patty, suitably light on mayo but heavy on yummy melted cheese, and with fresh lettuce and tomato.  Around the table other diners in our group enjoyed a prepared to order Mushroom & Cheddar Burger and a Whiskey BBQ Burger.  By special request Diane received a now off the menu decadent Hot Fudge Shake, while others praised their dessert-like Cookies & Cream Shake.     We were comfortably seated at the only round six-seat table on the patio, and service was brisk and friendly.  It was a five-star burger experience!",

We kindly replied that we rather not sit by the garage cans. There was only one server helping over 8 tables who was overwhelmed but still friendly.   She did move us, and after that we sat in a good location. It is located on the strip and it was nice to sit outside with the misters. They had some amazing fries, and probably the best vegetarian burger we ever had. No fillers and over a dozen ingredients. It didn't stick together like a patty but it was so good who cares.   It's a pretty cool place for vegetarians and you must try the burger.",

Hands down the BEST garlic fries I have had in a long time! Fried to perfection with a TON of fresh Garlic and salt...yes that simple, but super GOOD!  Stripburger is known for their blue cheese burger and when asked if I wanted a menu the answer was NO because that is what I was going to get. NOT SO FAST!

    "text": "Stripburger is a solid choice for burgers, fries and shakes.  And sitting out in the open air, along the Las Vegas Strip will make you think you've sat down in a dream of tasty treats.    Their menu is filled with great burger, fry and milkshake choices.  When we were there we ordered up the bacon and cheddar burger, green chili cheeseburger and hickory bacon burger.  And Stripburger was close to spot on with each offering.  The bacon toppings were delicious and perfectly crisp.  The cheese was gooey and oh so good.  The patties themselves were solid, but not the greatest taste in the burger world.  Our complaint?  Green chilis that were pickled and spiceless.  Seriously?  If you're going to offer a green chile burger then knock me out.  The chilis should light my mouth on fire.  These chilis were tasty enough (i.e., I enjoy the taste of pickles), but bland when it comes to spice.  We also ordered up some green chile fries and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are award-winning.  The chile fries?  Eh.  Same problem as the chile burger discussed above.    Sounds like a decent burger joint right?  So why the four stars?  Well, the answer lies in Stripburger's milkshakes.  Wow.  Just wow.  According to Homer, the Greek Gods reclining on Mount Olympus feasted on ambrosia.  The gods were cheated.  Ambrosia is boring nonsense compared to the Stripburger butterscotch or cookies and cream milkshake.  Sooooooooo good.  I'd head over there just for the milkshakes even if I didn't want a burger.",

Overall, the burger were decent, though the kitchen was rather sparse on the condiments.  The milkshake I had with my meal was really good. However, I can't recommend this place as the service is simply awful.  We saw our waitress twice - once when she took our order and finally a long time later when we paid.  Someone else delivered our drinks and our food.  The server never came back to see how our food turned out or needed more to drink.  She was rarely out in the dining area, and when she was, she was taking an order from what had to be more than a dozen tables she appeared to be working.  I finally had to flag her down long after we had finished eating to get the bill.  I don't know when she would have gotten around to checking on us if I hadn't.  Never a word of explanation, so I have to assume this was a normal night. Overall, while the food was decent and the location was nice, this place just isn't worth the hassle.  Prices are about what you would expect for the Vegas Strip - not as high as a hotel based restaurant, but much more expensive than outside of Vegas.",

Z, our waiter, was cute as a bug and exercised the perfect balance of being there when you needed something, but did not hover!  Something I really hate.

    "text": "LIving on the strip in a condo makes this one of the spots that I frequent most.  The reason for my 2 stars today is all due to the service I just experienced for our server JILLIAN.  Where do I even start!?  As we were being seated by the sweet hostess, I noticed a young blonde girl sweeping by our table.  After being seated and looking at the menu for 3 or so minutes, that same girl who was sweeping came to our table.  She NEVER gave us her name, just asked what we wanted to drink.  Now I have been a server and a bartender at many places and I know the Universal Steps of Service!! Always start by being polite and saying Hello, my name is.... Come on! Common Sense!!! Anyway, she took our drink order and came back with it.  I had water my friend had an Iced Tea.  She forgot to bring a lemon with it.  That is also common sense.  She didn't try to up sell beverages.  Normally you ask, would you like to start off with a pepsi, ice tea, or an ice cold beer etc. but this was not even offered to us.  She then took our order and walked off.  I noticed that there was only one silverware wrap-up on the table and she did not notice it.  I waited to see if she would catch that.  Our food was delivered by a food runner and that food runner didn't catch the 1 silverware roll up either so I stood up and grabbed one from another table.  The food runner, also female said nothing to us. She did not ask if we had everything, if we needed anything, or to even enjoy our meal.  Jillian, was no where to be found.  We had our food for about 5 minutes before she even came over to see if we were okay or if the food was cooked correctly.  Well, my fries were a bit cold but I let it slide.  Our drinks ran low, so I pushed my glass toward the end of the table with hopes she would see it.  As she stood with her arms crossed against the wall I started to get mad.  Everybody knows when a drink is half full you refill it, but mine was completely empty. As she stood against the wall looking around I wondered how she did not \"see\" this.  As she walked to the back to avoid us I stood up and POURED MY OWN WATER from a pitcher that was by us.  YES, I poured my own water.  As I did this a server named ALEX came over and he was so polite and sweet.  He asked us if we were okay and if we needed anything.  He grabbed my friend more ice tea and he then bussed our table and took the dishes we weren't using all while our own sever Jillian watched him.  She is something else.    Being a server is a team effort.  I would be livid if I had to pick up the slack for a lazy server who clearly was hating her life that day and who showed she did not want to be there.  So, with that said, I asked Alex what her deal was.  He said she was upset because her guest had been stiffing her or tipping poorly all day.  WELL I WONDER WHY!! Now comes the best part, she asked if we wanted desert then dropped our check off.  Her name was on the check so that is the only way I got her name.  I asked for a manager and relayed all of this to her as well.  The manager was extremely responsive and helpful.  She offered to do something for us but I said no.  I was not looking for a hand out just good service.  I told her that Jillian's poor attitude and lack of serving skills makes their place look bad and I just wanted to address the issue so Jillian's attitude could be adjusted for her next set of patrons.  Our bill was $29.00 so we left Jillian $3.00.  That is more than she deserved clearly.  Since I am in the Vegas service industry I just couldn't leave nothing.  I get it, we work for tips and that is our sole income.  But as I walked out I did hand Alex a $20 tip for being so polite and helpful.  He deserved it.  Now, the kicker of this whole experience..... as we left Jillian yelled out, \"ADIOS\" in a snide tone.   Are you kidding me!! How old are you!? So I asked again for the same manager and told her about that as well.  That is seriously uncalled for.  If I was Jillian's manager I would have sent her home to adjust her attitude.  I hope you are reading this Jillian because this is NOT how your treat your customer unless you want to get getting Zero to 10%tips.   Take some notes from Alex!  All in all I do love this spot.  The food is yummy and I haven't had a bad server experience until tonight.  Yes, I will return but you best believe I will not sit in Jillian's section again.  I'll save my $20 for the next server.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a really long time, since my first visit to Vegas in late 09. We finally went there last night. I was with my boyfriend and his Aunt. After the long trek to get over to the area, we were seated super fast in the bar area outside. Our waitress was really nice despite how busy they were. She kept filling our glasses with ice cold water - we were all thirsty and HOT!!! My boyfriend and I ordered the veggie burgers, and his aunt ordered the green chile burger. We shared a \"threesome\". The order came extremely fast. I fell in love with my veggie  burger at first bite. If you are vegetarian and need something good - this is it. It is $9 and HUGE. If I wasn't starving I would have only been able to eat half. My boyfriend still got a 1/5th portion of mine that was left over. It was truly fantastic.   The threesome was delicious too. The onion strings (which I cleverly placed on my burger) were yummy. The fries were so-so but not awful, and the PICKLE fries were SO good that we ordered a single serving of them. They were surprisingly delicious and worth trying. I recommend getting the threesome if you are with a group so if you like them, you can always order more!   We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> $10 cert so our order came to $30 after that deduction. The staff was really attentive despite the busy night. The Aunt was afraid of her medium burger and the chef was extremely sweet about it and offered her a new one if she didn't feel comfortable eating it.   Overall, a great experience. I just HATE how hard it is to get there and back to your car on a late night.",

The toppings were generous, but I've had better blue cheese- the flavor just wasn't there. The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking, but it's not a very large burger so I left hungry. For the price, I feel like fries should have been included, however, those start at around $4 for a side. But then again, this is on the strip, so everything tends to be overpriced. I'm willing to give this place another shot if I'm in the area, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

We started off with their current shake on special, the Smores Shake. OMG. Heaven in a glass! It was like a smores, with yummy vanilla ice cream, graham crackers between layers, chocolate, marshmallow creme, and a huge heap of whipped cream on the top.  We split the burger slider trio - which was the bbq bacon slider, blue cheese burger, and the regular cheese burger. These sliders were cooked to perfection and came on a potato bun, they were super yummy!!! As the burgers do not come with a side, we also ordered the fries&onion strings combo - it was huge!! The onion strings were amazing, better than the fries.  Stripburger definitley statisfied my need for a burger and fries while on vacation. If you stop by, I highly recommend trying a shake. And be sure to come hungry!!!!",

First off, we didn't need the appetizer, that's how many fries they bring. The burgers are huge as it is. But they basically brought me a medium sized mixing bowl of fries. That being said, they're very good  and very garlicky.   My bf got the gourmet bison burger. He said it was even better than the burger at BurGR.   We got the onion rings as an appetizer, and like I said we really didn't need it. They were also very good though. Extremely crunchy on the outside and did NOT  get that slimey onion on the inside thing going on. honestly, just to die for.   They have more options as far as burgers compared to Ramsey's. And the taste is on par if not better. However, it took for frickin ever to get our food. Don't know if that is normal or not. But honestly. Worth the wait",

They have a wide selection of sandwiches, burgers, and salads which made it extremely difficult to decide which to order.  The burgers don't come with fries, so as a group we ordered \"the threesome\" which came with fried onion strings, french fries, and fried pickles. The fried onion stings were a little soggy and too greasy for my liking, but the fried pickles were awesome. The french fries were standard fries, nothing to write home about.  But a must is to order the chocolate peanut butter milkshake. If you have a weakness for sweets like I do, you'll die when you take your first sip.

It is also an outdoor setting, so beware come summer time!! There are about 10 burgers to choose from, and all are about $10 each, without fries! So, I'm guessing that's pretty pricey for just a burger.   I recently tried the Southwest chipotle burger, and the burger was A-ok!! I'd have to say the famous blue cheese burger is what keeps me coming back!! Another must-try are the onion strings!! An order can be shared until it is all gone! =D  The chocolate shake is also magnificent! You can just taste and feel the chocolate bits melt in your mouth!!

We actually went to the mall looking for another restaurant. Once we discovered that the other restaurant was gone, we decided to try this one. And we were pleased with our choice!  My wife had the Ahi tuna burger and said it was great, tasting like a sushi burger. I decided to try the southwest burger. The chipotle mayo was a nice addition.   It is important to note that all items are a la carte. So, fries or other sides are ordered in addition to the burgers. This does inevitably increase the total bill a bit.  The service was good. The waitress had tried most of the items and was able to provide good recommendations. The food arrived rather quick, but not too quick to make you doubt the \"made to order\" status.  Shortly into our meal, however, another waiter was walking past with a platter of food. He lost his balance and spilled a couple full plates at our feet. There was sauce and ceramic all over the place. Somehow, most of the mess seemed to avoid our feet. We were not upset, we know accidents happen after all. However, you could tell that the staff was troubled. A manager came by to check on us a couple of times. We repeatedly said that everything was fine, no worries. At the end, our waitress informed us that our fries were being comped by the restaurant. When I got the bill, I also saw that our drinks were covered as well. A nice surprise. Quality service.  The location for the restaurant is great for people watching. It is right on the corner of the Fashion Show mall. If you sit outside, you can watch the cars and people move down the Strip.  I think Stripburger is worthy of a visit.",

Being hungry and a bit cranky we decided to go somewhere before I got to the \"Feed me now or it's off with your head\" stage. Lo and behold a burger joint across the street!   Stripburger is an all-outdoor eatery with shaded tables and of course: full bar. The friendly hostess greeted & seated us quickly. Scanning the menu, two things quickly caught my eye: the green chile cheeseburger and the pickle fries. H ordered the hickory burger and my mother settled on the daily special which was the bacon cheeseburger with small fries. We ordered a side of fries (the burgers do not come with a side).   The pickle \"fries\" came out first but were actually chips instead of spears. I was expecting spears and prefer them over the chips but these fried sour pickle chips were pretty darn good! I have come to the conclusion that the best pickle to batter and fry is the good old sour dill. Sliced thin and coated with a light crispy batter, these pups didn't last long.   Our burgers arrived and Whoa Nellie are they huge! My burger was laden with roasted Hatch green chiles, melted pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce and onions. The burger was thick, juicy and full of flavor. Grilled to perfection and served piping hot once I picked it up it never kissed the plate again. Fries? What fries. I was too busy with my burger. I did manage to try one and it was a-ok. But really you don't need no stinkin' fries! H declared his burger superior to the Cheeseburger in Paradise found you-know-where.   The staff's friendly and they work together well. I spotted several heaters for when the weather is cold but have no idea what they do when summer hits L.V. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and insanely great burger look no further than Stripburger.",

I ordered the mini-burger happy hour special which is $2 mini burgers which are 2 oz each. I ordered 2 of them and shared a $2 fry with my friend.

It was 12:30 am, we're starving & had just been told Mesa Grill closes at 11 pm (this is Vegas, baby, why would anything close that early?) Stripburger to the rescue!  Atmosphere: circular design with bar in the middle & tables on the perimeter. Lots of neon green lighting (like they're on St. Patty's Day overload.) Music is a super upbeat & is a mix of R&B & hip hop (Rhianna, Kanye, Fergie.) Wherever you are seated, you'll have a pretty good view of The Strip.  Service: Hostess was a very concerned Asian girl who explained why there would be a few minute wait & checked on us to make sure our waitress had come by. Waitress was quick & efficient-loved her.  Food: Extra yummy. The bf & I shared \"the threesome\" (fries, extra thin onion strings & something I've been wanting to try-fried pickles) & a banana shake (good size for sharing, lots of *real* banana flavor.) I ordered a chicken burger with bacon, BBQ sauce & caramelized onions (flavors are fantastic-i definitely recommend this one ) & the bf had a cheddar bacon cheeseburger.   Total: $33 (not including tip.)   I could give Stripburger a big ole' smooch for being open til 2 am.",

I ordered the Bison burger which comes with a creamy french cheese, I don't recall the name but it was a good match with the Bison.  I ordered medium rare, it came out more medium but still had a little pink and was not dry so I went with it.  Fries were really good and more than enough.  I think I would have preferred a slightly more upscale lettuce than iceberg on the burger but that is probably picking at nits and certainly will not keep me from going back!  Another very decent burger place in LV!",

Plus as a bonus it did not cost us fortune like it did when we ate at the other places.   The burgers are the bomb, and I got my garlic fries which were yummy. Sitting outside was nice especially since the weather was nice. Didn't realize until later that they had dinning inside as well which is good to know for our future visit. This will indeed be a favorite stop for us to eat whenever we visit Vegas again.   As a nice bonus we had great service with Chris who was very familiar with the menu and suggestion. Plus we even had the honor to meet and talk with the VP and partner Ross who checked to see if everything was okay and that we were happy with our food and service. Now that's what I call A Great Place to Eat!!",

I just refilled my 320z Margarita before coming here (BUMMER)!  The bartender was a complete b*tch! (excuse my profanity) but she was the complete reason why this dining experience was horrible. She was not personable, never cracked a smile, and she seemed she did not want to be there. On top of that there were foreigners who sat next to us and she yelled at them because they had trouble understanding her. She snatched the menus out of their hand and stormed off with their order. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! Her tip reflected her ATTITUDE. Please avoid her she is blond and wears a hat.  Food was ok, nothing spectacular. I ordered a regular cheeseburger medium rare. It was nice and bloody but not really seasoned. It was just AVERAGE. I have tasted better. It cost $9. I had a beer (BUD LIGHT) which was $2 because of happy hour. My gf had nachos which were decent but still had no WOW factor.  They have a late night HAPPY HOUR which was nice.    The location is cool except the seating is outside. Weather could pose a problem.  There is so many burger locations in VEGAS and this was a complete MISS for me. I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Thanks, Strip Burger, for being open on Easter Sunday.  But boo to you for your hiring decisions.  Strip Burger is a burger joint on the strip (clever, huh!).  We went to the fashion show mall location.  It was open on Easter, even though the rest of the mall wasn't.  We were HUNGRY and happy to find a burger joint with an interesting veggie burger and fried pickles.  We ordered \"steins\" of cheep beer(they have 16 oz and 32 oz on their menu), I ordered the double original burger, the wife ordered the veggie patty (the rice kind, with nuts and seasonings in the patty) \"done up Mexican style\" (to include roasted jalapenos), and the \"threesome\" (fries, onion rings, and fried pickles).  We wait.   Our beer comes, but in 16 oz. pint glasses.  We say we wanted steins. The (fairly sweet but obviously naive) server says that she'll just bring us the second half later.  We wait.  Our food comes (thank goodness... most of the other diners had to wait a lot longer).  My wife's burger is cold, and doesn't come with the Mexican fixings she asked for.  The onion rings are really straws, good for putting on hamburgers, but way too stringy to eat by themselves.  The pickles are OK, but there aren't enough of them, and the fries are tasty.  My burger is tasty, but certainly not better than a top-notch fast food place (Five guys, etc.)  The wife finally gets the roasted jalapeno, and cojita cheese for the \"Mexican\" toppings, but it's just one pepper -- not sliced to put on the burger or anything.  She eats, and the burger proceeds to fall apart.  Everything there is tense, as people aren't getting the right orders, or not getting their order in time.  We get the second half of our beers in traveler cups and get the bill--- she charged us for 4 small beers instead of 2 big ones (which, of course, is more).  Really?  You made a mistake and we have to pay more?  If you don't know what a \"stein\" is, then you should say \"we don't have that.  We have 16 oz glasses and 32 oz mugs/glasses/buckets/whatever.\"  My burger was fine. My wife's probably would have been fine if it weren't cold.  The atmosphere was nice -- outside on a beautiful day.  But we just had to get out of there as fast as we could.    Sorry, Stripburger, we'll be skipping you next time.",

When the food arrived everyone at our table was raving about how delicious the burgers were. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and was blown away at how delicious and juicy the chicken was.

The bartender was friendly so no issue there. My problem was with the waiter who walks up right next to me at the outside bar where I was sitting. He asks the bartender if she wants to watch the Giants game and grabs the remote and changes the channel as I'm looking at the TV?!? It appeared to change all of the TVs and then he walks away?!? No one asked me if I was watching the TV and no one seemed to care if I was or not. WTF!",

The only thing that kept them at a four was although quality and taste was great, it wasn't extra, above and beyond, out of this world like I need a 5-star burger to be. For the price and location you can't go wrong, however, and it's worth the visit. I'll be back trying other burgers here as well. I had the blue cheese burger this time but look forward to trying others next time in Vegas.",

The fried pickles are a great starter     And, Not to forget the great selection of unique cocktails  after the storm ( black cherry vodka, watermelon and island kicker with sweet and sour) or the jack d with lemonade and ice tea resembles as a jacked Arnie palmer just to name two. If you got Amy as bartender you will have a great night.  Say high from Martin & Dietmar lol - here favorite Germans but no kidding she make the best booze mixes and has great story's to tell.   Perfect location to just sit enjoy food and drink an watch the traffic and people walking through the strip. And parking at the fashion show is still free!  ****** Another great stop here. Having Hugo as server was great! Go on guys!  *****  And again a perfect burger and such nice people. Amy behind the bar counter almost make me regret that I don't drink any alcohol! But to watch her interactions no with the guests is fun enough!",

They have heaters and fans for the different seasons. Have a good menu and a half decent beer selection. I told my waitress that I had a garlic allergy and we got our drinks. Our food came in good time and the food was good. I had the cheddar bacon burger with fries. My friend got the Mexican burger and he liked it as well. He ordered a vodka cranberry and he started drinking out of it and noticed the glass was cracked or chipped at the top so he didn't drink any more of it. We let our waitress know about it but she did not take it off our bill. Later that night I was sick so I'm thinking something I ate between the fries or burger had garlic. It was a good meal and I would go back, maybe we just had a bad night.",

While $14.95 seems expensive for a veggie burger it's right in line with what everyone else charges so wasn't upset about that. I would however love to see them add vegan mayo or vegan cheese to the menu.  Overall it's a good vegan option to get while your doing some shopping at fashion show.   Pro tip: remove the cheese and mayo and ask for sauteed mushrooms.",

When we showed him pictures of what the impossible burger was suppose to look like, he said \"I guess we do it differently here\" he also stated, \"you aren't the first people to complain about the burger here.\" huh?

We let the server know and she gave us bottled water free of charge.   I ordered the whiskey bbq burger and my boyfriend and I split an order of fries. The burger was very good but the fries were horrible. They were fried so hard that they were hard. We ended up not eating half the order because they were so hard.

Their burgers were so juicy and something about the buns of the burger made it that much more delicious. I had the cheese burger with bacon with cheddar fries and garlic fries to share. I'd say that the fries portions are pretty big. I shared two order of fries with 5 people and we didn't finish. The burgers are also relatively large. If you're not a fan of crunchy well done fries you might have to ask the server to let the kitchen know because my orders were definitely considered well done.   It's mostly outdoor seating and it's kind of towards the back of fashion show. Just in case anyone has trouble finding it because I did!   All in all, for Vegas pricing I'd say $10.95 for a well made burger is decent and worth it. I'd totally come back if I was ever in town and was craving burgers. I stayed at treasure island which was across the street and was definitely walkable distance!",

    "text": "Was in Vegas for work and visited the Strupburger two times during my stay. The visit experiences were completely opposite of each other and perfect proof that the right wait person makes ALL the difference in a good overall experience. Visit number 1 - easily a 4-star visit, close to 5 star for this type of place at this price point Visit 2 - might have earned a 3 star rating  Because I know sometimes stuff happens, I'm giving it my initial 4 star rating.  Visit 1: It could have easily taken a sideways turn, but our waiter was in spot and made everything right. We walked up and there was no one to greet us, just at the point of being an annoyance a waiter walked by and said someone would be right with us. He had a fantastic smile and apologized for our wait, and we were seated very soon after. That nice guy that greeted us at the door happened to be our waiter (save 1).  He was super nice and helpful. I asked to stray from the menu for a bit, by putting Brie cheese in my burger and he was totally accommodating. Unfortunately when the burger came out it was with the wrong cheese. :( He came to the table moments after the food did and was super apologetic and scooped it up. My correct burger wasn't far behind.  Visit 2: Host was one of those people that wait for you to acknowledge that you're there. This is a huge pet peeve of mine, it's your job... greet me with a \"Hello\" and a \"2 for dinner?\". Don't make me greet you when I walk in. I'm not getting the paycheck. Anyway, we were sat. Because our waitress was busy the manager took our drink order. The service was slow this visit. Once we had the chance, we ordered our food and a milkshake at the same time from the waitress. Good showed up and the milkshake never did. Done with the meal and she came up and brought my hubby a new soda and asked me if I wanted a beer to go (yet the soda she brought him was in a glass - not sure if she expected him to slug it down while I got a to go beverage?).  \"No, but we did order a milkshake, were kind of wondering where that went.\" She apologized a D said she'd take care of it. Quite some time later, at the point where we were ready to just ask for the check (but we realized that we hadn't seen her since she brought the soda) she finally showed up with the milkshakes. We asked for the bill at that time, cuz we didn't want to wait any longer.  Food: The burgers were SUPER. And we highly recommend the Cheese Curds Fries and Cheddar Fries. The milkshakes were very tasty. And I am ALWAYS about a boozey milkshake, so I had the Chocolate with the Jack Daniels.  The seating area is nice with trees across the Strip from them (instead of looking at yet another resort). The music was a little loud but they had a GREAT selection of music!  Hopefully they're working on the training issue. Otherwise a great place!",

SEATING: It's a small outdoors restaurant so I would NOT recommend going in the middle of a hot Vegas day! We went for dinner on a Wednesday evening after the sun had already set behind the mountains so it was a bit cooler. We had a nice view of the strip which was fun for people watching.   BAR: The bar and actually the restaurant itself is a circular shape with high top tables all along the rim. Good thing they had fans for extra ventilation.   SERVICE: Since we went in a weekday night we were seated right away which was nice since we were hungry!  FOOD: The menu is simple and fairly easy to follow which is good! One of my culinary pet peeves is when the menu is super crammed and unorganized tht I can't even navigate it! You order burgers and sides separate. My friend and I each got a burger --she got something with blue cheese and I had one with onion strings and the perfect amount of whiskey BBQ sauce! We also shared an order of sweet potato fries, which I'm glad we did because it was HUGE--we couldn't even finish it. The fries were delicious and crispy with some salt and Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.   If you want a semi quick heart meal that's tasty and a good view of the strip, this is your place!",

    "text": "I really enjoy posting positive reviews and helping to encourage additional business for a restaurant that does its job well.   This review, unfortunately, needs to be filed in the \"constructive criticism\" category.   Things that need fixing:  1. The outdoor patio reeked of vomit or rotting garbage... not sure which. I asked for a table change, which was accomodated and the server mentioned she was well aware of the smell and it is typical at that side of the restaurant. The new table still smelled awful... I gave up and didnt ask for another move.   2. I went for a bison burger because their yelp menu showed bison... bison is no longer on their actual menu. Take note - if you have over 250 reviews on yelp, it might be a good idea to update your details regularly.   3. The restaurant was MAYBE 1/6 full and the food took forever to come out. Two burgers and fries took somewhere around 40+minutes  after placing the order.   4. Gluten free bun was as hard as a rock. This is not hyperbole... I could not compress the bun with hand strength. I asked the server if this was normal and she said it was because the buns come frozen and then they aren't soft once heated?? I have eaten a lot of gluten free buns in my day and never seen anything like this.   5. Fries were so-so.   6. Server was friendly but there is too much negative outweighing the friendliness to warrant an upgrade from one to two stars.",

Also, if you work in the mall, they give a SWEET discount and also deliver to you for free! Also, the alcohol milkshakes (ughhhh yes, you read that correctly) ALCOHOL MILKSHAKES are TO DIE FOR!!! Great outdoor spot with a view of the Wynn and the fashion show mall. Gotta go order my lunch now, LOL. #NotKidding",

At night they were running a dollar beer on certain beers. So we each grabbed a beer and than we also got a burger each and shared fries.  I'm not a burger fan but I got one. It was pretty good I mean it wasn't the greatest but it was good. It was juicy and I got it with lettuce and tomato. I couldn't finish it because it was really big. So it was a good thing we shared the fries since it was a whole basket. The fries were nothing special they were your typical French fries.   It was late when we got there so there was only outdoor seating and it was super hot. It was after midnight and it was 98 degrees. They did have some fans blowing with mist.",

Our waiter recommended this burger to me, so I ordered this one instead of my original choice on the menu. He said this burger he recommends only costs $1 more, but gives me more mushroom.. Okay, so the result is what I just described.   My bf was trying to be very nice to them and ordered another one for me, and we ended up paying for the crappy one they recommended to us as well. And yes, the second one we ordered was fine.   So I am giving them a three star instead of two or one.   TIP - don't listen to the worker's recommendation. Just order the ones on the menu. You will get regular taste burgers.",

My friends & I decided to walk to stripburger from our hotel at Planet Hollywood since we'd have to burn off the calories somehow haha! Anyway we called ahead of time to see when they'd close and waitress said midnight. We arrived 11pm and now that I think about it maybe we shouldn't have came so close to closing because our burgers didn't taste that great or fresh..  Atomic fries - pretty plain tasting Garlic Herb & Sweet potato fries - BOMB! this is what made me decide to give 3 stars instead of 2. The garlic fries were really fresh with garlic pieces and seasoning was spot on! Sweet potato fries were addicting as well. I ended up eating more of the fries than the burger  Blue Cheese Burger - My friend ordered this and said it was just ok, nothing amazing. Mushroom Cheddar Burger - My friend said she didn't like it. The buns soaked up all the juices and so it was falling apart. Hickory Bacon Burger - I asked for mushrooms to be added to this burger and they forgot the mushrooms. In the end I was charged for the mushrooms, but told the waitress I didn't even get mushrooms in my burger and she fixed the bill. This burger was pretty bland, the only thing that made it taste good was probably the bbq sauce & caramelized onions.  Overall, it took a LONG time for our burgers to be served and the patties for all 3 burgers were cold. Not even warm! Debating if I should give this place another shot next time during lunch time since maybe they were about to close and so they did a sloppy job? These burgers were pretty plain, should have spent my money at Bachi Burger or Holstein's instead.",

I ordered the burger medium rare with the egg over easy.  The burger was way over done, but Amy took care if me and sent it back. The second attempt was less well-done, but still not anything close to medium rare (and the egg was definitely NOT over easy).  I do not send food back twice.

Considering the place is called Stripburger, I ordered the \"Our Famous Blue Cheese Burger\" to see what all the fuss was about. I also ordered a Strawberry Milkshake. First came the shake, which was thick, creamy, and loaded with strawberries! Delicious! The burger came very shortly after and it was pretty damn good! There was enough blue cheese that you could tell that it was present, but not overpower the rest of toppings and the juicy burger patty. I'm glad I didn't order fries because I was stuffed after the burger and shake, but they did look good! The service was great and the servers were definitely on the ball delivering food, getting/refilling drinks, and were very friendly! The only thing that I will deduct *1 Star* for is the VERY spotty water glasses. First I thought it it was just our glasses, but I noticed them on all the other tables around us. Great food, just clean the glasses a little better!",

It was cooked to order the way I wanted it, and with the condiments that I selected. It was just the right size too. Not quite as big as a burger from Island, and not as tiny as one from In N Out either. Also, I order a side of fries -- half sweet potato fries and half garlic and herb.  I asked for a side of the chef's special dippin' sauce with them on the side too. The atomic fries, which are topped with cheddar cheese and sliced jalapenos are great too. Just ask and you can mix what variety of fries you'd like. Good food, drinks, good location to people watch on the strip!",

I must have needed to stay in bed a little longer because I ordered the shrimp bucket (SICK) thinking it was \"just what I wanted\".  It was so gnarly when it came.. the shrimp weren't cleaned, cooked, or edible, but I decided I came this far and I'd give it a go.  GOO!  They tasted even crazier than they looked and when I sent the dish back the waiter made a good point - why would I order fish in the middle of the desert?  While this was thought-provoking and very True, I have always believed that restaurants should stand behind everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on their menus.  Thus I am giving Stripburger two stars for making me want to commit suicide over a bucket of shrimp, while taking my own responsibility for ordering the most repulsive thing offered and giving them the benefit of the doubt.. I'm sure their burgers are just fine.",

Prices were decent, especially for the Strip, service was fairly speedy, and their beer was cold.  I'm not hugely committed to this place but also not awfully repulsed.

They are a great place for lunch my favorite is their chicken sandwich it will not let you down and goes great with cheese fries. Also happy hour is great $2 beer and 4 dollar margaritas how can you go wrong. Problem is that the food comes out 2 times faster when your at the bar making it worth it to sneak a spot if there is one. The bartenders are amazing they are always fun and make sure that everything gets done right. The managers are great too they will talk with you and actually care that everything is good, and take the time to find out about your day and how all is going. Again its a good place to eat.",

Not only are the burgers insanely yummy but so id everything else.   If you don't like spicy things they do also have cheesy fries. If you've read any of my reviews you'll know by now that I LOVE CHEESE! My heart goes out to you lactose intolerant people :(  Anyways, last time I was here was when I was in town for CES2011 and our waitress was super nice. Now I''m not sure if the service was just slower that day or because I was about ready to eat the small child at the next table...could have been both, but I'm going with the latter. I managed to shovel down a burger and a bowl and a half of atomic fries...holy orgasm in my mouth.   After coming here I pretty much always end up coming out looking 10 months pregnant but I will never regret it (thank you fast metabolism!)   Would recommend this as a great lunch or late dinner burger joint..they also serve extra large drink sizes for alcoholic beverages so thats always a plus :)",

My girl and I went there on our way out of Vegas. We got there at about 10am on a Friday. Well, they don't open until 11 so we wandered around and came back at 11.   We got a really friendly server with what we thought was an Australian accent. Turns out he was actually from Boston. He was very prompt with the order taking and made a couple suggestions with the food as well. His suggestions probably made my burger better tasting too. He was definitely a people person and seemed to like his job. Far better than those servers that just do the bare minimum. Great server.  My girl got the bacon cheddar burger and I tried the southwest burger. We split a basket of fries and onion strings. Share those things... they're huge! I can easily say that this was the best tasting burger I've ever had and I love a good burger. The bacon was thick and actually cooked all the way unlike most places that can't figure out how to cook bacon. My girl thoroughly enjoyed her burger as well. The onion strings and fries were really quite good as well.   We will definitely return to Stripburger next time we're in Vegas.",

We asked to be seated indoors and it was clean so no complaints there. Our server was very attentive and made sure to answer any questions we had about the menu. She also told us about some of the specials not listed on the menu, all which sounded tasty.  The food was delicious. My burger was cooked exactly as I asked and quite filling. All in all, a solid, well cooked and seasoned burger. The one thing that I really recommend is the garlic and herb fries. They were the stars of the entire meal. Of course, my breath was kicking after, but it was definitely worth it because they were that good. The sweet potato fries were also pretty nom. A word of advice, if you do want a side, split it with a friend, it's a lot for one person.  If you are in the mood for a burger, and not a fast food burger, try this place. It's a hidden gem in the mall.",

I ate the cheddar burger first, just a simple cheeseburger, and it was already the best burger I'd ever tasted. We also shared a basket of the garlic herb fries, which were absolutely delicious, clearly made with fresh ingredients, and paired perfectly with a side of their ranch dressing. With my meal, I drank their raspberry chambord \"adult milkshake\" as well, and it was definitely in my top five list of most delicious things I've ever tasted. Furthermore, it was far more affordable than most of the other places on the strip. We will definitely be returning as soon as possible.",

    "text": "This review is strictly for the cheese fries and mini sliders. Our friend had a blue cheese burger that she enjoyed very much but since I did not taste it, I will not review it.  I had ordered the cheese fries and the cheese did not look so good. Once I tasted it, I realized it was not real cheese. It tasted very rubbery and fake, almost like cheap nacho cheese from a dispenser. I ate most of it because I was buzzing pretty good and needed something to eat. I was not impresed with the meal.  I also split mini sliders with my girlfriend and they as well weren't all that great.  We looked at the sliders and they had a disproportionate amount of bread to burger size. The mini slider was very narrow thrown on in the middle of a big bun of sorts that was big for a slider size. It made eating the slider somewhat difficult. Overall, not impressed.  Lastly, a drunk pirate with his bird made me pose in a picture with him outside the restaurant. Not only did his bird shit on my arm, he of course spilled his beer on me as well. He was kind enough to wipe the crap of my arm with his jacket and wash my arm with beer. Nice guy....",

Still, its a PITA and in my opinion, unacceptable. But anyway, you go through the restaurant that's to the left of RA Sushi.  I Googled BEST BURGERS ON LAS VEGAS STRIP. This place came up. FOR THE PRICE, this place beat the competition. FOR THE TASTE, I prefer BLT BURGER at the Mirage. I've had the BURGER BAR at MANDALAY PLACE but for some reason this year, wasn't as good. That said, StripBurger comes in second.  THE SERVICE isn't bad. Let's just say that you get what you pay for in that regard. Will I be back? Of course.

Shakes were excellent.  Fries and onion strings good - fries were good and the onion strings were a nice change from the usual rings.  Average service and nice to be outside on a warm day.

We had a yard from Fresh but sadly we couldn't take it in with us so we were forced to take out food.  We ordered a BBQ Chicken Sandwich.  It cost about $10 which is pretty steep for just a sandwich/burger.  It was good, but not $10 good.  Good crisp and spice, but just way too expensive.  Kind of glad we took it out so we were able to drink our yard while we ate the food in the food court on the third level of the Fashion Mall.",

    "text": "I have the incredible fortune of living in Las Vegas and dining at some of the best restaurants in the world.  Unfortunately, STRIPBURGER is not one of them.    I ordered a beer, burger and fries as I sat at the bar.  The food was fine.  Not terrible.  Not phenomenal.  I would say acceptable. A little pricey, but everything on the LV strip tends to be a bit higher priced so no major surprises there.  At the end of the meal, the bartender gives my bill.   I submit my $15 off a $30 purchase coupon to her.  She rings the transaction on the cash register, I pay and she gives me my receipt. Right before I left, I told the bartender I would be back for another beer after I did some shopping in the adjoining mall.    One hour later, I returned. I sat at the bar again with the same bartender.  I ordered another beer.  The price is $11.00 plus tax.  I lay my $10.00 off any purchase coupon on the bar along with two single $1.00 bills.  In Las Vegas, NV the state sales tax equals 8.1% of your total purchase price.  On an $11.00 purchase, the sales tax equals approximately .89 cents.  So the total of my beer should be $11.89.  This is where things start getting dicey.   The bartender picks up my two single dollar bills along with my $10.00 coupon.  She immediately places the two $1.00 bills in her tip bucket.  She then proceeds to lay my $10.00 coupon on the top of her till drawer on the cash register and she completely fails to ring my beer purchase on the cash register.  I get no change and no receipt.  Meanwhile, the bartender has three separate girlfriends who visit her, on three separate occasions during my visit.  The bartender seems to be more interested in jawboning with her girlfriends then paying attention to doing her job and taking bar orders.  At one point, a gentleman on the other side of the bar actually yells ''Excuse me Miss, may I order a drink''.  By this point, I decide I am going to speak to the Manager about what I just witnessed in regards to the bartender failing to ring my transaction, return my change and provide me with a receipt.  I go into the restaurant and find the Manager named Scott.  I relate to him exactly what I have outlined here, and I describe in exact detail what the bartender did.  This Manager Scott, and I utilize that term loosely in this context, because Scott certainly did not behave like a Manager.  After I explain what I witnessed, he looks at me with this blank stare and says, ''I will go and get you your change right now''.  I explain to him, ''It's not about my .11 cents, It's about the principal of the matter.  Are you at all concerned that your bartender is taking cash that belongs in your cash register drawer and putting it in her tip bucket and failing to properly ring transactions?''  Scott immediately becomes defensive and very rude and states, ''Maybe she thought it was a tip.  Look, I don't understand what you are complaining about.  I offered to get your change and you refused.  I will have a conversation with her and that conversation is none of your business''.  I reply ''May I ask you a question, how come I did not receive a receipt for my beer purchase?''  Scott replies, ''It's our policy to only issue a receipt when requested to do so''.   I reply....''WRONG!  I received a receipt 1 hour before from the same bartender for my lunch purchase, AND I DID NOT REQUEST IT!  So what is your receipt policy Scott?''  By this time Scott is becoming visibly agitated with me and again, in a very rude and condescending manner, ''Look I told you I would speak with her about it and you already said you don't want your change so what else is there to talk about.  At that point, I state, ''you know what, I'm done speaking with you, have a nice day\".  So I proceed to finish my beer and prepare to leave.  I glance down at the end of the bar and I notice manager Scott speaking to a well-dressed gentleman who just entered the restaurant, and I see Scott motion over to me, as if he is relating my story to this other gentleman.    Next thing I know, this man comes up to me and Scott introduces him as Mr. Ross B, Vice president & Managing partner of the restaurant.  I'm naming this gentleman, because he requested that I do so when I told him he could read my review on YELP.    Mr. B. goes on to state that Scott told him about my experience.  A this point I inform Mr. B that Scott is very rude and spoke to me in a very condescending and unwelcomed tone of voice.  I went on to say that I was more than happy to speak with him, but I was done conversing with Scott and he could exit our conversation.  Scott leaves and goes back to work.  Mr. B. goes on to state that he had never known Scott to be rude.  I told him that he would probably be amazed at some of the behavior of his employees when he was not present at his restaurant.  AVOID THIS RESTAURANT LIKE THE PLAGUE!",

They were ALL good, but the Blue Cheese Burger was out of this world!! Their sweet potato fries and garlic herb fries were TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend this place. The atmosphere is relaxed, it's all patio style seating. The ONLY thing that went wrong during our visit here was our ticket got lost, for our table of 11.

Our server was extremely pleasant and a few other employees even stopped by our table to ask about our experience.  I love great customer service and this restaurant definitely offers that!  Selection: My party ordered the Classic Hamburger, Green Chili Burger (with pepper jack cheese) and Threesome Fries (regular fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries) to share.  I've been to a few burger joints and think that the burger patties here are merely average-tasting, nothing special.  The burger patties (and texture) sort of tasted like Smashburger's.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.  Atmosphere: The restaurant decor was trendy and the ambiance matched its decor.  The restaurant has outdoor seating (perfect for people-watching) with heat lamps.    Overall, I unfortunately wouldn't return for their burgers but would consider returning just to people-watch.",

It is a bunch of chain stores and tacky shops thrown together in a flying saucer looking building.  Nothing about the place says Fashion, Show, or Mall.  But anyway...Stripburger.  Right across from Wynn...or Encore...whichever one that is.  Sit outside and you can see Trump Casino in the distance.  Horrible service but the food was decent.  It is relatively cheap.  Good news is usually the service is so horrific that you will not feel bad about not leaving a tip.  So...cheap food and no tip should be in your budget.   Here is a tip though...it is not a good place to get drunk because it is at a major intersection.  If you get hit there will be nothing but a blood and margarita mixed smear on the ground with an imprint of Penn & Teller advertising.",

We ordered a side of fries which could have fed all of Cesar's Palace.  Huge!  Finish this and expect heart trouble!  On the down side, the service was a little spotty and the prices were a little more then I think they should have been.

Situated in a small corner on the outter-crest of the Fashion Show mall Stripburger lives up to the name by offering some excellent comfort burgers at their smaller yet, well maintained location.  The location offers a great view of the Wynn and makes you feel cozy just sitting there; onto the food.  Calamari was decent; dipping sauce made it The Fiesta Burger w/spicy chorizo was the special; it was fantastic  I usual order my burgers medium-rare; it was spot on like I cook em' at home The sweet potato fries were delicious, can't wait to try the atomic fires The service was great and the bar was packed with people; made for a great atmosphere. Overall, I thought it was awesome and can't wait to go back; go now!",

    "text": "I love this place!!  I currently live in Hawaii and travel to the mainland a lot for work (and for fun).  I always stop in Vegas to break up the trip (horrible flyer) and though I stumbled upon this little gem while staying at the Trump, I now make it a point to stop in even if I am staying at the opposite end of the strip.  Here is why:  a) the food is great!  While this isn't a 5 star restaurant inside of a 5 star hotel, it is a burger and shake place that is really really good at what they specialize in!  I think I have tried every burger on the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet.  b) the price-  They have a great happy hour--- even still, I am almost always there before it starts and it doesn't even bother me because prices are so reasonable.  And the burgers are huge- you get what you pay for  c) location- I actually love that it isn't right smack in the middle of the strip.  It is close enough to be convenient and walking distance regardless of where you are staying, but not as in your face as all those restaurants lined up on the strip with people bombarding you with flyers offering drink specials to lure you in.  There is a lot of hustle and bustle in that area and its nice to be able to get a mini break from that (and its all outside too which is nice).  d) service-  this was really the best part for me. As someone that has worked in the industry for years in the past, I am extremely lenient when it comes to sub-par service as I know what it feels like to be on the other side of that especially when it is extremely busy or you are down a server, etc.  I always try to be polite and understanding regardless.  But, on the flip side- bartending/serving in high-volume restaurants for so many years has also allowed me to know an amazing bartender/server when I see one.  And let me tell you, the bartender here is one of the best there is.  I travel solo a lot so really the only people I come in contact with outside of work are those in the service industry.  I try to follow their lead and if they are busy I just focus on my food/drinks and if they are friendly and not slammed, I make a new pseudo friend for a few minutes.  I was extremely impressed with Rebecca (I think that is her name- it is the name on my receipt but sometimes bartenders share registers-- she is the lunch bartender-- I usually go on monday or tuesday when I am in vegas).  She is sweet as pie and sociable but still really aware of her surroundings and attentive; super fast and knows her stuff.  Its not uncommon to find a funny and likeable bartender or an extremely fast and skillful one- but in my experience it is very rare to find someone that is both!  In this industry people often work their butts off and do not always get the recognition they deserve...  so I decided to take a few minutes to make sure that doesn't happen here!  She is by far one of my favorites...and I travel a lot.  Overall, I love this place and look forward to going back on my next vegas trip!  Oh, and in case you guys didn't know... you can take alcohol to go and walk down the strip with it!  I discovered this while here and thought it was awesome....and crazy.  So obviously I ordered an alcoholic milkshake to go!  And... I suggest you do the same. stat.",

Food: I love the mini burgers- plain with american cheese and ketchup!! YUMMY!!! My husband loves a good ol fashion cheeseburger. We always split a side of fries as well. They are perfect combination of crispy outside and soft inside.  Drinks:  The only thing we ever get is the 32 oz. Chambord Rita!! Delicious! (It's our way to get a fix of Z Tejas). It's best to share one so you can drink it before it melts and then order a second one.  Service: We have our favorite servers- Tyson and Justin! Very personable and make lunch/dinner fun. If you go- tip them 20%+ Happy Hour: great! $2 mini burgers, $2 fries, $2 beers (select ones) and $4 margaritas! You can get a lot of food for really cheap!!  Sign up for the lettuce entertain you rewards card! You earn points and get $10 rewards to be used at the restaurant. They also have a texting program.

We were seated immediately, and our waitress was with us within 10 seconds. She got us water and let us browse the menu for a bit. When she came back, we ordered the guac and chips, blue cheese burger, and the Mexican burger. I asked her what was a sweet and not too strong drink and she recommended the \"ticke me pink\" which I agreed to. My drink came out in about 2 minutes or so in a mason jar which I thought was pretty cute. It was also really good.  The chips and guac came out first and was amazing, but also super filling. We decided not to eat all of it so we could finish our burgers. Our burgers arrived. Mine was the Mexican burger, my boyfriend had the bleu cheese burger. Both were really good, we finished it all. Our waitress kept checking on us and refilling out water during our time there, and was always really positive and smiley when she came to us so it was a good experience. Our total bill came out to almost $50, but with the coupon we only wound up paying $23 or so.  Great food, great service. I'm coming back again the next time I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "Okay, so maybe it's against the law to have wine with a burger, but I don't usually follow the rules.  I had no choice here, where it's beer first, last and always.  Or a milkshake, which I haven't had since 1983 (so how come I'm not skinny?)   I would have preferred a Riesling, and even would have settled for a lowly white zinfandel.  Ix-nay on either.  Strike One for my first visit here.  So I won't drink, and I'll have coffee instead.  \"Yes, it's fresh,\" the waitress answered.  \"Ah, but do you have milk for it.\"  \"No, just cream.\" (See 1983 above). Strike Two.  Strike Three came close to happening.  I ordered the mushroom and cheddar burger with a salad on the side.  I was about to throw in the towel after the waitress said the dressing was a lemon vinaigrette, which I'd love to love, but most vinaigrettes are too tangy for my delicate Princess mouth.  She saved the day by offering to let me have ranch, and I got the feeling she was doing me a favor because of the first two strikes.  Oh, she was very pleasant about it, but I just sensed this wasn't in the script.  The burger was excellent, but almost rare, instead of the medium I ordered.  I like rare hamburgers, but the Food Police tell me not to eat them.  It didn't have a lot of the cheddar, which was fine with me, and the mushrooms were fresh and plentiful.  My husband had the same thing, and enjoyed his.  One friend ordered the turkey burger, and the other had the ahi tuna.  They loved them both.  We also shared a basket of the sweet potato fries, not usually high on my list, but these were delicious and not greasy or oversalted.  Would I go back?  Probably, as long as I remember to bring my hip flask.",

Our server was so slow and didn't even bother refilling our empty glasses when she was right next to our table chatting it up with her coworkers. I don't care if you're going to get tipped already, but seriously at least act like you're trying to be a good server. But aside from the crappy service the food was great. I decided to go with the southern burger protein style, which is just replacing the buns with lettuce. My friends and I ordered three sets of fries: garlic, nacho, and sweet potato. They were suuuuper good. I really enjoyed the food here, just not the service.",

However, my burger, a cheddar and mushroom, cooked perfectly medium rare, was a piece of deliciousness and really satisfied my burger craving.  If you're looking for a decent priced meal, mine was $9.95, and/or craving a burger I'd recommend this place.  Also, from 9:00 PM on they were doing select beers and well drinks for $2.  I'm not a fan so much of that as I'm a scotch girl myself, but for those looking to save some bucks and have a few, it's good to know.",

The food was very much on point, albeit still pricey. The sandwich ( a la crate) was $9.95 + sweet potato fries which were around $4.00 and a Stella which was also around $4.00. But, my friend works for Apple at Fashion Show so our gracious waiter gave us 20% off discount which brought our bill to $24 combined. This was reasonable price to pay for a delicious sandwich with a beer and fries on the strip. Our server was very nice, but the hostess and the bartender looked bored and snobby. Yawn. Also, be prepared for the OBNOXIOUS drunk foreign tourists. All in all not a bad place to grab a delicious burger and a beer and people watch.",

Basically it's just fries, cheese, and raw jalapenos.  Wow they were amazingly good and made the whole meal worth it.  The best of both worlds would be atomic fries from here and burgers from burger bar.  LOL I'll be back for the fries but I prefer my burger from burger bar.",

But when it comes to cocktail dresses for $9, I finally give in.  After spending several tedious hours trying on clothes, I need nourishment before heading to work.  In a moment of weakness, I stroll through the food court, but who am I kidding?  I hate food courts and even in a nicer mall like the Fashion Show, the outlets all offer the same junk. So now I am torn between Maggiano's and Stripburger.  After browsing both menus, I choose the latter.  It is a gorgeous day and Stripburger has all outdoor seating right on the strip. All of their burgers are $8.95-$9.95.  The fries are not included.  The drink menu looks tempting, but like I said, I am headed to work soon, so I settle for something from the Lake Mead region. My burger comes in less than 15 minutes and is cooked exactly as ordered.  The accompaniments (roll, tomato, etc.) are all fresh and this is a very good burger.   Would I make a trip to the strip just to eat here?  Probably not.  But I would definitely come back should I be caught hungry in that area again and maybe next time I can sample some of their adult beverages.",

Fries come in a huge basket so you can share them with another person. Prices were reasonable. Service was excellent. It was right across the street from our hotel so very convenient, especially to go hit Fashion Show right after ;-)",

I tried the fiesta burger and my bf got the blue cheese burger. The special items on happy hour menu were on average $10-15 which includes fries. The regular menu items were al la cart. I asked for medium but my patty came out a little bit dry. Flavors were just okay and the bread was adequate. My bf liked his blue cheese burger and the cheese fries were  average. They also have adult milk shakes here. Place is small, nothing nice. Place isn't anything to rave about. Go to Holstein instead.",

    "text": "Hmmmm, I wonder why they call this place Stripburger. To be frank, I stumbled into Stripburger.  For God's sake this place sits on the corner of Fashion Show Drive just a few steps up from the LV strip.    I do remember the bar was outside with tables to sit around to eat and drink.  I had the Mini Burger Sampler-$10.95. I liked the variety and that these were small bites. I choose: Blue Cheese, Hickory Bacon-Carmelized onions, with Hickory smoked sauce and Cheedar Burger <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stripburger-las-vegas?select=6vBkjVbU2uZatWn2Rkxjww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>. Out of these 3-hickory bacon was my favorite and I do believe they sell these as a real burger size.  I would have been content on the minis but my eyes were bigger than my tummy and I orderd wings <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stripburger-las-vegas?select=j3aeOfX325YW8s7sb3mGJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a> and (Onion) Strings-$3.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stripburger-las-vegas?select=07gowubWvaZZL7cXmlCmjA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a> from the get go.  Stripburger probably saved me from a hangover and was convenient at the time, so thank you.  Other than that there's so many other spots I'd choose to eat at out here.",

It says a lot that they actually take the time to review patrons feedbacks because after all in a town full of competition, your loyal customers and positive raves can be your biggest allies. So long story short, I accepted his apology and told him we would give it another try.  Last night we were back, service improved dramatically. The garlic fries and bleu cheese burger is a must try. Overall we had a much favorable experience this time, except for a few minor glitches and attention to details.",

It's a nice outdoor place to sit and the waitress was really cool. I saw another fellow Yelp review of ordered a trio basket of pickle fries, sweet potato and truffle fries. Good call Yelper so glad I read your review. I don't know which fry I liked the most so it was fun to decide but they are all so good. French Fries are one of my favorite foods. The burger is so messy but super delicious and it's pretty big- better to cut it in half first makes it easier to eat. I really enjoyed my lunch and had such an enjoyable time just eating after walking the entire strip and shopping all day. Perfect day- I was full the entire day and they give you so much food you may want to think of sharing. I couldn't finish it all and skipped dinner because I was full all day.",

Don't let the extreme weather keep you away!    The burgers are fresh (seriously!!) and flavorful!  Even the plainest of burgers here will knock your socks off.  The garlic fries are to die for.  And, if you're not already thinking alcoholic beverage, then you should give the chocolate fudge milkshake a whirl.

If you're in the Fashion Show Mall, you can only access Stripburger from the outside. Seating is outdoor and covered. We were protected from the rain by cover and kept warm by the heaters.  Service was excellent from Briana. She introduced us to the menu and burgers competently and stayed on top of everything for the entire meal.  The green chile burger was delicious. The beef was flavorful and juicy, not a frozen patty. The burger had a little kick from the padron peppers. The bun was soft and fresh. Also ordered were the bacon & cheddar burger and the California chicken sandwich. We were able to split one order of fries for three people. No complaints from anyone and all the food was gone by the time we left.  I recommend Stripburger if you want to break from walking on the Strip to have a drink at the bar and people watch. Or if you're at the mall and don't want to settle for a burger anywhere else inside.",

The chairs are definitely not comfortable but it's right on the strip and you get to people watch while you eat. I still have it 5 stars because the staff was fast and friendly and the food great!",

My husband and I both got cheddar bacon burgers. I asked for the pickled onions on mine. Wasn't an issue. The only reasons I took off a star are as follows: the garlic and herb fries were literally swimming in garlic oil. Which made half the bag of fries inedible; and the bacon was basically not there, I got one slice broken in half and put on like an X. Which just isn't really acceptable given the price. Anyway. I'd still check it out. Ours was a to go order. Maybe it would be better if we could have sat down to eat. Not sure.",

Wings were good, Mimi burger was good as well. They dropped one by accident so they made my guest a new one. At least they were honest lol. Stiff alcoholic drinks well-$4 each.

We came here in the afternoon so it wasn't too crazy inside. I'm sure at night it's crazy busy since it's right on the corner of the street.  Now to the food.  The burgers were on point! The cowboy burger has bbq sauce and fried onion rings.  The meat was cooked perfectly. Juicy and flavorful.  The blue cheese burger had tons of blue cheese, which We Love!  It was so decadent.  The fries are fresh cut and they come in a bunch of varieties, garlic herb, cheese, atomic, and a few more.  We got garlic herb and it did not disappoint.  The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The fresh garlic and herbs were perfect.  We also ordered chicken wings and chicken fingers and both were super crispy and not oily at all. The meat was juicy and cooked well.",

The atomic fries were not spicy or hot at all. My opinion.... go to Red Robin and get your endless fries! I wouldn't recommend nor return.",

My friend and I ordered drinks (which were awesome). She ordered a raspberry adult shake(spiked) and I ordered their special lemonade(spiked). Both decent prices and both yummy!!

After a long morning and afternoon of drinking and hanging at the pool, you bet my girls and I were hungry! The food is so expensive at the pool so we walked five minutes down to Stripburger. We were seated right away, ordered and the food was out in less than ten minutes! It felt like we just ordered, it was very quick! Even though it was fast, they didn't skim on flavor or juiciness. The burgers look just like the photos and each of us enjoyed our meal! We each seemed to be wearing whatever condiment in our face because it was so good.   Many comments during lunch included:  \"My burger is so juicy!\"  \"Where did your bun go? So juicy the bread soaked it up!\" \"This is so good, it completely hit the spot!\"  I ordered the chicken sandwich and I think I swallowed it whole cause it was gone in minutes after I ordered.   I only rate this 4/5 because the service was nice but we didn't get checked on frequently and had to ask for utensils/napkins. When we first arrived we asked if we could all sit together (five girls) but each table on had 4 seats. We didn't get a clear answer and we had to grab our own chair. Hopefully when I come back and try this place out again I can update my review for 5/5 for great food and servi",

Unfortunately I think it was just some 18 year old kid in the back on a Wednesday night. Worst $17 I've spent. Feel super slighted. Could have gone across the street to Urth cafe for the same price and had an artisan European meal. Oh well. Anyways. Not trying to be mean.

Would've been a healthy meal if I hadn't have wolfed down those fries. Chocolate shake was AMAZING too.   Plus, it's on the strip and you get free parking at the Fashion Show Mall. Good service too. This one's a keeper.",

    "text": "My best friend is a burger connoisseur, so we've had Stripburger on our list of places to try for awhile now. We had to do some shopping at the Fashion Show, so we stopped to grab a bite first.  We sat outside and it was a chilly October evening. It was nice to take in the sites and people watch but at times it became loud because of traffic and I understand it's the Strip, but there were constant sirens going off from emergency vehicles attending to situations at nearby resorts. I didn't think about that possibility until it was happening and we both found ourselves wishing that we had picked indoor seating instead.  Service was fast and friendly. Our fries came out super quick, but burgers took awhile. My friend had the wagyu burger and finished the whole thing, even with her small appetite, so I'm guessing it was pretty good. Haha. I had the slider sampler trio. It was good and I especially enjoyed the slider with the mushroom and bleu cheese, which surprised me because on previous occasions at other restaurants, I haven't enjoyed those things. My biggest complaint though is that the burgers were soooooo greasy and salty. My stomach was aching and I was feeling sick after only the first slider. We had a side of sweet potato fries which were served with some type of smoky sauce which was a good combination. We also had a side of garlic fries which I recommend 100% they captured the True garlic taste and it didn't taste artificial like most places.  I liked it, but I'm on the fence about going back.",

I got the blue cheese burger and it was like heaven in my mouth and my fiancee got the turkey burger and the fries and ranch ahh! Delicious!! It's kinda embarrassing but we ate here for lunch and for dinner... In the same day.. Because it was just that good. Now onto the customer service which I value very much. Alexis was our waitress for lunch and she was very attentive and sweet so thank you! When we came for dinner we ordered to-go from the bar and Maria took our order and chatted with us while she was bar-tending for other customers, she's very good with her multitasking skills and very nice. Oh and Ross the co-owner checked in with us during our lunch and it was very nice to see how much the workers there appreciate their customers. We can't wait to come back to Vegas just to eat here again",

BUT I SURE AS HELL GOING TO TRY....  Tonight we decided to have a family outing of shopping and dinner at Fashion Show Mall, however, what started out as a great time quickly turned into an amazingly bad experience thanks of course to the HORRIFYINGLY BAD service at Strip Burger.  First off, it took your hostess 15 minutes to have us seated at a table, BUT THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED!!!  It took her so long to come back to us that we contemplated on just getting a To-Go order, BUT (TO NO) SURPRISE, THERE WASN'T ANYONE THERE TO EVEN HELP US PUT IN AN ORDER!.  Luckily (or not), this \"hostess\" finally finds a table (again.... EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE) for us to sit in and a server takes our order.  Now, I ordered the new Velveeta Burger which had a simple ingredients - Burger with Velveeta with onion strings and Russian dressing.  Simple enough right?  But I got what looked like a regular burger with Russian dressing - NO ONION STRINGS.  NOW.... before you say I overreacted and should have just sent it back.... I say, \"I WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK HAD THEY ACTUALLY COME BACK TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING.... OR ANYTHING WAS OKAY!\"... but she never came back... not for anything.. not even to check to see if we needed a napkin...  Mind you, I was trying to be calm about this (pardon my language) whole fucking situation, but what sent me over the edge was that, my family had finished their dinner (I was just too pissed to eat) and we waited patiently for our server to come back because we wanted to place an order to-go for my little brother that was studying at home for his midterms.... we waited.......and waited.... and waited.... AND WAITED.... until I had enough and had to go hunt her ass down to tell her I wanted to place a to-go order and the check!  AND THEN WE WAITED.... only to be sent a different server to take our order (MAYBE OUR ORIGINAL WAITRESS WAS SCARED -- AND WITH GOOD REASON!)  I have never had an issue with this place before.... in fact, I loved coming here with friends and our past experiences here had been awesome... But truth be told, I'm just over it now -- I don't think I will be coming back here any time soon.... or bringing people here to dine any time soon....  Your service at Strip Burger was impeccably bad that I would have rather gone through a Burger King drive-thru .... At least I would have gotten my food as well as my check in a timely and less frustrating manner than what your SORRY EXCUSE for a wait-staff you had tonight had given us!  If I ever do come back here, I will definitely make sure that I come when your A-squad is working and not your D-squad... although, why should I take the chance again?  It was truly insufferable.  I do hope you enjoyed the note that I wrote at the bottom of the check.  PLEASE.... DO reflect on that message.... and YES... I did spell out the gratuity for you in perfect English -- Z-E-R-O.",

Being a creature of habit, I always order the blue cheese burger, medium well (go ahead and crucify me for not liking pink in my hamburger). We also always order the Threesome fries basket but I ask for the Garlic Fries because they are amazeballs.  Last time we went, my daughter ordered a Butterscotch milkshake and it was delicious. My husband loves it here because they will cook his burgers (almost) as rare as he likes them.  I also have to give special props to the sweet potato fries. They're crispy and delicious and I would totally swim in a vat of the weirdly spectacular barbeque/mayo (?!) sauce they come with.  When we do order adult beverages, they are always good with plenty of alcohol.  As to the aforementioned spotty service, I'm still trying to figure it out. We've been there for lunch and for dinner and it's just hit and miss. Specifically, mostly hits with the occasional miss. I can live with that for their sweet potato fries.",

I went for the green chili cheeseburger that comes with roasted green chilies and pepper jack cheese. To my surprise, it was only OK, when it sounded so great in print. Darn it, so onto the fries. MMMmmHmm. The waitress, who was slightly on the rude side, told me to order the garlic herb fries. I was surprised that fries didn't come with the burger, but just ended up splitting them with a friend. They were crispy and not too garlicky, but pretty tasty. I ended up eating most of them and not of the burger. I also thought it was a neat place, all outdoor seating with a strip view, so I recommend it for fries and atmosphere.",

There is nothing really innovative about Stripburger (especially in a location with as many options as the LV Strip), but the food, service, and ambiance were very good.",

However the weather at that location is hit or miss can be windy can be to hot or too cold outdoor seating is all they offer and that just does not cut it in Las Vegas however they are part of El Segundo so you can share that restaurants dinning room if you cant hang outside. Also it is a lettuce entertain you entity and therefore I will remain loyal. Go mon ami gabi GO . In all honesty run across the street to Wynn go to the cafe overlooking the golfcourse and have the best hamburger you have ever had price is under 20 $ it is worth stopping by. Plus you have a view of the 18th hole at Wynn looks pretty cool.",

The food was unbelievably good. The ahi burger , the shoestring sweet potato fries - WOW.   It was so amazing we came back a second time before leaving vegas and experienced the same amazing service and food all over again.   WONDERFUL STAFF AND FOOD!!! Great job!

    "text": "We were hungry one night about 9 pm and the food court at the Fashion Mall was closing. Strip Burger was open so we figured we should try it out. I heard this place can get pretty packed but it wasnt a weekend so it wasnt too bad. I realize its Vegas and they are trying to be hip and all that but the music was blasting WAY too loud. Actually I dont mind the loud music, but it made it almost impossible to hear the waitress and vice versa. She evidently didnt hear part of our order so it took a while before everything we ordered actually arrived to our table. The bacon cheeseburger was pretty big and tasted pretty good. Not great but pretty much what you get at similar places for the same price. The garlic herb fries were good and one order is plenty to share with another person or two. As we were seated, we walked through a conversation/arguement between a manager and waitress. Sounded like confusion and wrong orders going out are not unusual. Maybe it was just an off night. If you have kids, I would suggest considering the age and appetite of the child before ordering off of the kids menu. For an 8 year old, the kids cheeseburger was pretty small. The manager was really nice and attentive. He asked if we would like a heat lamp next to our table and he promptly brought one over and lit it for us. Leaving took a little while also due to the waitress bringing us somebody elses check. The manager saw me looking around for the waitress and came over and got us the right check. I think a lot of people would give less stars with the problems that we had but,  like I said before, it may have been an off night. The employees are friendly so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.",

We ordered 2 chocolate cake shakes and some drinks to start. first shake came out in 5-10 min, the other came out as our meals came out just after our drinks. Shouldnt have to wait 30 min for some waters and cokes. Burgers were nothing special. If you split a burger as I did with another girl, expect to have a tiny piece of meat on the bun. I had to take the bun off because couldnt even taste the burger. Chocolate cake shake is awesome but burgers were just ok. if you go plan to fill up on the shake and fries- because burger wasn't worth it.",

When I went inside to the restroom, I noticed that there was indoor seating too. However, it is great for dining outside while taking in the Vegas atmosphere during the warmer months.   Stripburger advertises a lot of freshness behind their food, such as never-frozen patties and freshly cut fries. The bacon and cheddar burger is pretty good. I've had better patties but this was pretty satisfying. The veggie burger has a patty made from brown rice. It is very well-seasoned and delicious! Burgers averaged from $8-11, which I consider pretty cheap given it's Vegas.   The cheddar fries came with a creamy sauce and shredded cheddar cheese on top. It was a great guilty pleasure. Adult shakes are always fun to drink but can be over the top because the burgers are pretty heavy.   Overall, this was a very chill atmosphere with good food. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars because it's more than okay but I can't declare myself as a fan. Nonetheless, our helpful waitress, constant refills, and the satisfying meal pushed it to a 4!",

The 5th star was for the exemplary service.   First, they over cooked my first burger. I would never have known this accept our server came out to apologize for it taking so long and explained that they were making a new one for me. Some may complain about this but to me that is a sign of top notch service. When they don't let food leave the kitchen until it right is how it should always be. I'll happily wait if it means I get what I ordered.  Second, when we ordered my wife's meal we asked for 1 of the mini cheeseburger sliders since her stomach was not up for a full size meal, but they brought us the 3 slider meal. Without a word from us the waiter came and pointed out the mistake and made it right on the bill so we were only charged for the single.   I had the blue cheese burger with bacon. Messy as hell and easily one of the best burger I've ever had. I recommend this for anyone trying to find great food at a reasonable price with top notch service.",

The restaurant seating is completely outdoors and you have the option of sitting at the bar or at the side tables that overlook the Las Vegas Strip.

What I ordered: I tried \"Jeff's Shakin Lemonade\"  ($10) which consisted of Kettle One vodka, lemonade and a big sprig of Rosemary. I also ordered the Prime Rib burger ($17) with Truffle oil fries. My burger was juicy and delicious with just the right amount of char. I definitely enjoyed my hamburger and fries!  We had a super sweet server by the name of \"Z\". Good service really matters when you have so many dining options here in Vegas. Not to forget, I can get away with spending under $5 for a killer tasting burger at In-N-Out.

It was about 11pm, We beat the scorching heat. Earlier it was a blistering 113. Seating was outside surrounding a round bar.  Luckily when we got there it was happy hour!!  Sliders or mini burgers, well wines and draft beer was only 2 bucks each!!!  We tore it up with some sliders, sweet potato fries  and a whisky burger that was incredible!  Service was great!!

I don't have a very high expectation for drinks in Vegas anyway - so I accepted whatever they could do. They were flexible in fixing the drinks if you don't like them.   I ordered their vegetarian burger... and I can swear to anything that they have the best in the whole country.. Being a vegetarian, i have tried veggie burgers at a LOT of places.. The patty is not a generic hard soy / black bean patty - it had a soft melt-in-mouth patty with actual veggies and cashews. It is rich, flavorful and indulging.

When we mentioned the difference the solution was order her another kid's meal while all of us sit with our food getting cold waiting for hers. They didn't offer or make an adjustment on her meal for their error.   Also, they just automatically add 18%. Considering service was very slow and with the error on the meal... Again I felt strong armed into paying a higher gratuity than I felt the lackadaisical staff deserved.   Just beware and check your bill before you leave.",

You could walk into Shake Shack, Fatburger, Epic Burger, etc and have a similar experience. It seems that Stripburger is a niche restaurant designed (name) to cater to the Vegas crowds.  Anyway, we stopped in for lunch one day during a recent vacation. We didn't want to sit outside in the heat so we opted to dine inside. \"Inside\" is actually the backroom area of the adjacent restaurant. There are a few tables in an area designed to actually be a prep area. There is NO attempt to hide this fact either. No dressing up the area or anything like that. That didn't bother me though. It was cool and quiet.  I ordered a regular burger with fries and a coke. The burger was pretty good. It was well proportioned and seasoned to perfection. The fries were tasty and big enough for us to share. (even though we ordered two separate baskets) The bill came to a little over $10 which is pretty standard for these types of places.  I probaby wouldn't eat at Stripburger again given the plethoria of choices in Vegas but I encourage you to check it out nonetheless.",

I don't think it's the best burgers I've had though overall.    The happy hour is very solid - $2 beer, $2 fries and $2 sliders from about 3 (or 4) - 7PM and 11PM - close.  Definitely worth a stop if you need some cheap eats.  Service was very solid too (and a little busy around 6:30PM) and there's bar seating as well as some tables.    The regular menu consists of burgers/drinks and a few other items.  Along with a PBR and a slider, I tried out the veggie burger.  The taste of the veggie burger wasn't too bad although it wasn't the best I've had.  The slider too was not too shabby - it was a pretty good deal for $2 although the sauce was a little too zesty for my tastes.    The scene seemed like a mix of tourists and locals (around happy hour at least) and again, if you're nearby the area, not too shabby of a spot to pick up some cheap grub.",

After walking through the food court in Fashion Mall it was clear that in this area, Stripburger is THE restaurant for a quick and quality bite to eat.  The prices were reasonable and the location was great being right across the street from the strip and in the high end fashion mall.  It's a nice change of pace from the constant overpriced low quality food elsewhere on the strip.  I wont name anywhere in particular because we've all paid a pretty penny and thought to ourselves \"ehh\".  Staff was friendly and everything tasted fresh and high quality.  I thought they had some cute options on the menu in both fries and burger options.  I got the burger sampler that came with three of their most popular burgers and the atomic fries (jalapeno and nacho cheese) to go with it.  I thought the sampler was cool because I like my burgers.",

It was juicy, delicious and grilled perfectly! Fries were good too (included with burger).  We also got the wings and the kale/iceberg lettuce salad.  The salad was a bit too peppery for me. I asked the waiter about the wings because I like them the perfect balance of crispy and saucy but NEVER soggy. She admitted that they were more on the crispy side and light on the sauce. She recommended that I get an extra side of sauce. I did.   The wings were perfectly fried crispy and light on the sauce like she said. I poured my extra sauce to my likely. The buffalo wing sauce tasted like a combo of ranch and Frank's hot sauce! It was amazing. It was tantalizing! My mouth waters just thinking about it.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The place has a good view of the strip so you can people watch while you eat. Happy hour prices were amazing for the strip ($4 beers and cocktails).

It still has the same long wait for food as last time minus the amazing customer service and tasty food to make up for it. What I really don't understand about the wait for food after its ordered is the fact that there's no wait to sit down.  Even our drinks this time took rather long to come out.   The service wasnt bad, dont get me wrong, it just wasn't on the level for the wait time.  The milkshakes are still delicious. I went with the tres leche milkshake with kahlua in it. If I wanted to spend more cash, I would of asked for an extra spot because the alcohol was hard to taste but little the bits of sponge cake that were inside made up for that.    My burger was still as jucy as last time but with absolutely no flavor. It left a lot to be desired. My fries were the same as far as flavor and texture go but luckily i ordered the cheesy fries so having that cheese on top helped.   I appreciate not having to wait to sit down to eat for lunch but the quality of food was not worth the wait for it to get to the table this time around.",

Seating is only outside, so factor that in when you plan to visit; it was suitably shaded and breezy (they also have fans and misters for the heat, and heaters for when it's cooler) and the music wasn't as obnoxiously loud as some places here.  Food was decent; burgers are a decent size, though a tad small for the price. The chicken strips are pretty good and also a bit expensive for what you get. The honey mustard leans more mustard than honey, but grows on you as you eat it. Shakes looked great but I wasn't feeling the price so water it was for me!  The issue here besides price was service. Our waiter, Ismael, seemed annoyed that he had to stop playing basketball to wait on us, and he visited the table twice before speaking to us. Not sure why he couldn't say hi while he cleared the extra settings from the table or filled the water glasses. He did seem to warm up as the meal went on, but you know what they say about first impressions!",

My wife ordered the Blue Cheese Burger and cheese fries, and I got a standard cheeseburger with pepper jack and the Atomic Cheese Fries.   We both topped it off with Stripburgers fantastic hand made shakes.  You might say \"geez, it's just a burger!\", but I'm telling you....hot, juicy, flavorful.  Probably the tops in Las Vegas and one of the best I've ever had.  Cap that off with friendly staff and great outside seating (with heaters.... it WAS February!), and it made for an awesome casual dining experience.  Whenever I make it back to town again, I'm coming here early and often!!!",

Not sure yet but the music is fantastic.  This is what it feels like when doves cry! I cannot help myself the beaconing of his vocals call to me I'm singing along so are most in the bar! Air keyboards as we get to the climax of the song!  It's happy hour when I came in so that's good I had what was on tap for the day. Which turns out to be Sierra Hazy IPA in a blonde. Hey the beer matches my hair awesome. The blonde of the beer enhances the taste of the hops flavor. The beers color is a burnt yellow. All in all I stuck with these through the whole visit. I believe that I'm on number three right now; at $3.00 a glass that's a steal. Now that we have covered the alcohol hurdle let's continue.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is themed to a beach cabana high end establishment that has amazing food and beer. In True Vegas style they hit the nail since everything about the bar is perfect. You know it's a great run business when the bartender does not stop. She keeps taking care of us patrons and fills the drinks for the tables around the bar.   After looking over the happy hour menu and the regular menu it is time to order. I am amazed at the size sampling's they offer here. An individual may order single size burgers and fry portions. The small cheeseburger that I ordered was delicious. It tasted like it just came from the grill in the backyard. I was so impressed when I took a bite from that little marvel. The cheeseburger melted in my mouth as I chewed that first bite. Savoring that taste it burned into my psyche forever. The burgers here whether big or small are worth the visit. Pickles are a weakness that I will break all the rules for. With that in mind pickles that are fried with ranch, yes I'll take those too! The pickles were so much more tasty when deep fried. Paired with ranch there is a masterpiece!   The service is flawless with the employees being very friendly. The staff interfaces with one another to help one another as needed. The music is up all the way and creates a powerful presence that everyone enjoys! The weather is perfect here in Las Vegas and as the sun sets the rays of light shimmer and sparkle on the windows of the Encore. What a place to just enjoy yourself!   The bar has televisions all around the bar and the World Series game three is playing. The Dodgers will win this game and bring the glory home to L.A. The music is playing all those songs you can sing along too, the beer is cold and on tap. If cocktails are your poison then the fabulous bartender can make your drink! The food, especially the cheeseburgers will stimulate your senses! Now come celebrate with us!",

We had just gotten off a cross country flight from New England and were in desperate need of a meal. We used Yelp, of course and this looked like the best of some foreign choices.  It's outside seating and though it was in the high 90's, it was shaded and comfortable.  I ordered the Blue Cheese burger medium rare and it was perfect. You needed a facecloth to eat this burger. I ordered sweet fries and they were awesome and came with this sauce that was like campfire sauce, but thicker and better. I tried my friends garlic fries and they had real garlic, not a powder and boy was it strong! Keep the vampires away!  I really loved this place. I can't recommend the burgers enough. Stop here if you are on the strip.",

Stripburger service:  We RSVP'd through open table not even an hour before our reserved time and they received it with no issues.  Party of 8 with one server and she rocked it:  got all our orders in correctly and kept our drinks fresh.  The manager stopped by and answered all our questions in regards to the burgers, cheeses used and brought over some fried pickles to sample.  Very friendly service here.  Stripburger Burgers & more: The Nacho Fries with the tasty atomic cheese is a delight for cheese lovers! (like me)  Don't worry, it's not too spicy in taste at all and I'm all for making it spicier if they wanted to.  I went with the mini burger sampler: blue cheese burger, whiskey bbq burger and the cheddar burger. All were flavorful but there's a tie for my fav: the blue cheese and the cheddar.    Stripburger ambiance:  Outdoor seating with a round shape bar showcased at the entrance.  The misters were on in full force to keep you cool and there's plenty of shading from the awnings above and the shadows from the Fashion Show building.  If you're not comfortable with outdoor seating, you might want to take your order to go.  Overall this is a solid burger joint on the strip with strip location pricing.  Their happy hour offerings and prices offers some amazing value.  Paired with great service and brigers, it's definitely a place I'd visit again to check out their other burgers, but that's another yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

Truth is, the burgers are solid, the cheese fries and fried pickles are good (any place that even HAS cheese fries and fried pickles is probably going to be a fave of mine), the beers are big, but nothing is the absolute best I've ever had. However, I love sitting outside RIGHT on the strip on a beautiful day, and getting in and out for parking/driving is a breeze... so, yeah... solid 4 stars!  They've started giving you the big beers in glass cups which I'm not a huge fan of, but I find if you ask, they'll give you a branded plastic one to pour into, and then keep (and if you're like me, you'll get 'service for 12' in no time :-) ) --- bonus is they are also dishwasher safe so far!  So go.... Go for the sunshine and beautiful outdoor seating in a primo location on the strip (anywhere else will cost you far more in food/drinks for such a spot)... Go for a burger, a big beer, some cheese fries, and some fried pickles.... I'll be sad when this place inevitably gets changed into something that charges more.",

The burger is cooked perfectly and the seasoning is perfect.  It's just a perfect, juicy delicious burger.

Strip Burger is located at the North end of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip. Most of the seating is outdoors with a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels. There is some seating inside for the colder months we have here in Vegas, so don't worry about the weather if you want to stop in for some great American fare.  Strip Burger has the usual drink selection of soft drinks and beers. Something there to satisfy any thirst. But if you want something more that just something to drink, Strip Burger also has a homemade shake. The shakes come in several flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cookies & cream. Each shake is so creamy and flavorful you will be asking if free refills are provided. No they are not. I was saddened at this. If you need something to cool you off when the weather is a bit hotter I can guaranty a Strip Burger Shake will hit the spot. Give it a try and you will see for yourself.  If fresh cut fries are your thing, make your way to Strip Burger. Their fries have a great potato taste, are perfectly cooked and just lightly salted with a coarse salt. They also offer sweet potato fries and one of my favorite things, fried onion strings. The onion strings are like onion rings, but they are not greasy and they are thin and crunchy. A real taste treat.  A Strip Burger burger may not be Angus Beef, but Angus is not always the only choice for a really good burger. The beef used in their burger is flavorful, juicy and keeps it's form well. The burger seems to be a third pound. The bun is soft, tasty and holds the burger very well. They do their burger several different ways all providing a flavor sensation in your mouth. I get the bacon cheddar burger now when I go. The bacon has a bit of a crunch to it but is not overcooked. The cheddar is nice and thick and complements the beef nicely. When you bite into your burger for the first time the juices flow and the meat provides a nice texture and flavor. This is not the best burger I have ever had, but it is very close.  Some restaurants can have bad days. Both in service and food quality. Strip Burger has had neither when I have been there. The servers and very friendly and are always there when you need something. Everything is brought to your table in a timely manner and picked up just as quickly when you are done. And the outdoor seating provides an open feel. You can't go wrong at Strip Burger.",

    "text": "Happy hour alert! Monday-Friday from 4-7. Got there at 3:30 and ordered a Blue Moon and Sierra Nevada for $4.75. Also got an order of the cheese fries (5.75). The fries are super crispy and blazing hot. Be careful when popping them in your mouth. My tongue is still numb. My only complaint is that they use American cheese (Kraft singles style) and sprinkled with cheddar. The strong processed cheese taste was overwhelming.  Once happy hour hit, another Sierra Nevada went down to 2 dollars and two sliders were only 5. The beef patties were super juicy and the dressing was simple. They came with chopped lettuce, diced tomatoes and onions with a thousand island dressing on an egg bun. For our pre and post happy hour order, our bill came out to be twenty dollars and change.   All the seating is outside, but with the misters, it was comfortable. The bar is the place to sit. Our bartender was attentive, but left us alone. That is the best service I could ask for.",

    "text": "Stripburger has eternally etched its place into the marbled granite of my mind as the catalyst for one of the most memorable/surreal/fun nights of my life. AKA the quintessential Vegas night/experience/story/whatever.   As a caveat, whenever I tell people about stripburger they always give me a kind of confused look. I mean, it being Vegas and all, anything goes, right? So I'm assuming that they're assuming that Stripburger is probably a strip club where you can get burgers? That sounds kind of amusing, but I don't know how I'd really feel about enjoying a nice meaty burger while simultaneously enjoying nice meaty stripper buns in my face or what have you. Cool concept though, so I'll put that on my to-do list when I have a gondola load of money.   Anyway, the strip in stripburger refers to the fact that it's on the Strip. Though, there is a stripper/strip club story in this story, I may not go into detail about it because this is yelp and y'all could be my grandmothers or my grocery bagger or something.   So the gist of the story is that I came out to Vegas for training for a week. One of my coworkers is also in town though it's for a different training seminar. On this particular day though, I couldn't find him so I'm basically moderately alone in Vegas (though one can argue you're never alone in Vegas or you're ALWAYS alone in Vegas) and I don't know enough about Vegas to know where to go/what to do. I ain't a gambler and I usually just follow my friends around like a sheep. There are other facets of sin that I can get into, but again, you're probably my rabbi.  I wander for an hour up and down the strip and I end up at stripburger even though it's about 7 minutes away from my Hotel (this was based on the recommendation of my shuttle driver btw). So I come figuring I'll sit at the bar, eat a burger, drink a White Russian and relax in Vegas.   The bartender girl was very nice. The drinks she gave me were pretty cheap and she was somewhat talkative. I ordered chili cheese fries and some sort of burger with bacon. I actually don't even remember what it was right now and it was only a little over two weeks ago! Everything was good, especially since it was on the Company.   Long story short after maybe sitting for 15 minutes, 2 dudes around my age sit next to me and I strike up a conversation with them. End up going out on the town with them and it leads to a very surreal night. S'all I can really say. So shouts out to them I suppose and of course, to Vegas.",

They even give you an oversized boba straw to suck up all the fruit they put in it. We also ordered the sweet potato fries to share, very good!  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 was because the service was soooo slooooow. The burgers took awhile to come out, as did the drinks, the our waitress was just not attentive to her tables at all. I noticed a trend amongst the other tables she was serving. Aside from that, great food! It kept me full all day!",

Believe it or not they actually serve burgers, and if you are way too fragile  to handle a large helping of charred flesh ( as I was ) they do a mean chilli and some decent soups.  The service was good, but one thing I must report - they serve absolutely without question the worst bloody mary in the history of the world. Bland. Weak. Almost tastless. A shot of vodka and a splash of ketchup would be more invigorating than the pathetic excuse for a pick-me-up this otherwise fine establishment offers its hung-over patrons.",

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas, we were meeting friends and they suggested here to eat, fine by us it was walkable from where we were staying and the prices were pretty reasonable.  For some bizarre reason I went for a grilled cheese sandwich instead of a burger, hubby went for mini burger sampler and we shared some strings and fries.   It was pretty quiet so we all got seated quickly, I had a milkshake, I cant actually remember what hubby was having drinkwise.  The milkshake came out- it was a really good milkshake though I think I should have had a different flavor- I had vanilla. Seriously? What was up with my choices?  The grilled cheese sandwich was good, though I dont think you can go far wrong with a cheese sandwich. Hubby liked his burgers but said they were a little salty.   The strings and fries were ok. They were cooked fine and were seasoned fine just a little greasy.   The service was good and the place was clean, I think ordinarily this kind of place for me would be a 3.5 stars, however they allowed us to sit there for around 2 hours longer without ordering anything else to sit and chat. This makes them awesome and deserving of a 4 star review.   Perhaps if I had a burger the review would have been more than 4 stars?",

We went to another table and the waitress in that station came over to get out drink order however we told her the other waitress got it, just not our order. We mustve been invisible to her because she didn't bring our drinks nor tell the other waitress what our drinks were. The table next to us got water and drinks before us, so I waited a few more minutes and the waitress came over to say that she didn't know what was going on but what was our drinks. Forget it, im leaving because this is just poor service.  That waitress should find a job she enjoys doing because this is definitely not her thing!

It sure sounded great : veggies, brown rice, sesame and sunflower seeds, cashews on a buttered bun. The man got the bacon cheddar burger and we shared a basket of fries. I liked them, simple, salty and crispy, the man however said too much salt and left them for  me. The burgers were $10 each, the fries $4 which is average, even cheap for the strip. The place is noisy, i didn't like the music but you could only sit outside with speakers everywhere. More a place to drink and grab a bite before going to the club, less for dates or families. Service was your typical aloof vegas stripper, charming to look at just don't expect  much, your order will be off and it will be impossible to locate her when you need her. Still we had a nice time and the food was great.",

When I asked to be moved either to the bar which only had one or two folks sitting there or to an empty table in the back that had lamps and a barrier, the hostess said no, that would mess up the server rotation. WHAT??? So she pulls a lamp nearby which was no help against the wind. The burgers were overcooked and the fries and straws came out cold. Took a few bites and got the rest to go. No more Stripburger for me. Ate there on Jan 4th about 3pm. It was such a different experience from the other times I have been. I think someone needs a staff meeting on customer service.",

This place is attached to the mall across the street and is down on the end on the strip.  We stopped here for a beer after a long day before walking up the hill to the hotel.  After sitting down at a high top the waitress handed us a happy hour table tent informing us that every thing was one dollar.  All beers were a dollar and all alcohol was one dollar per ounce!  I told her, \"That's crazy!\"  She said, \"No it's not, it's great!\"  I asked why the give away prices and she informed us that people thought it was too cold on the deck so they were running the special on the deck only.  Coming from Colorado, we certainly did not mind, plus they had heaters hanging from the roof.  Drank a couple of doubles of Maker's for a price that I don't think I could drink for at home.  Even with these ridiculously priced drinks, the staff was all over it!  I was touched by the graciousness of the waitress after I tipped her out a $20 - she acted like she had never been tipped that much - and I know I have never drank so much for so little!

It's a cute little outside eatery across from the Wynn hotel and it has little spray mists and fans to keep you cool while you eat.   Their burgers and fries are amazing. I ordered the cheddar and bacon burger and a side of garlic and herb fries and it was so filling I stopped half way through my burger I was so full!!! The basket of fries is large enough for 2 people to share so keep that in mind !! My husband got a turkey burger with added bacon and chipotle mayo with the atomic cheese fries!! We were burger and fried out! The atomic fries has nacho cheese and jalapenos on top they're yummy!  Our server was prompt and really nice she did a great job! The hostess staff is kind and quick. Overall great find on the strip !! We will be back next time we're in town",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here since 2009, but never got around to it. Weird unforeseen circumstances kept occurring whenever I tried to come here. It was almost like some divine entity was stopping me from coming here. The last time I tried to come here was in September 2010. I was in my car about to get into the parking building of the mall that  \"Stripbuger\" is located in when I got a telephone call. Apparently some guy who I barely knew from college put me down as one of his emergency contacts at work. I was told that they found him at \"Terrible's Casino\" laying on the floor and incoherently screaming and ranting before they decided to call the ambulance. That's his just-reward for going to college...a job at Terrbile's casino.  Getting back to subject. \"Stripburger\" was just as good as I anticipated. A lot of the people in Summerlin say that LBS at the Redrock is the best sit-down burger joint in town, but I gotta disagree. \"Stripburger\" is far superior to Redrock and has a million times better service.  I really like the fries here. They taste like they were pan fried with moderate amount of oil, instead of thrown into a giant deep fryer. They also intentionally slightly overcook the fries in order to achieve that really crispy texture. I greatly enjoy that style of the classic french fry.   I got the Blue Cheese Burger. It was excellent. They put a practical joke amount of blue cheese in it. The meat is super fresh and not frozen, and the bun is one of those high quality sponge bread buns like what they got at In-n-out.   The service was the best part. Our server was a man from Arkansas who was very charismatic and hardworking. I left him a very big tip on account of his great customer service. The host girl was very flirty and tremendously attractive. She was so distracting that I kept spilling my drink.   I guess my only complaint is that the seats are all metal and slightly uncomfortable, and you gotta go deep into the Mexican restaurant next door to use the restroom. Besides for that I gotta give this place a 5.",

There is no one I'd rather be than outside right now, so I decided to hit this place up with my fiance during my lunch break.   I loved the outside dining right on the strip. Good for people watching and it was enough to make me feel like I was on vacay during my lunch break ! The alcoholic drinks sounded awesome, but being the good corporate citizen that I am, I had to pass *for this time*.   I tried the sliders and tried Keith's suggestion of putting the yummy onion strings on them. They were pretty decent sliders.. they came with all the veggies on them (tomatoes, pickles, onions, lettuce), which is actually pretty rare for sliders! The aforementioned onion strings came in a 5.95 basket of fries and onion strings.. yum, I love having the best of both worlds!  Fiance was happy with his burger with jack cheese (although commented the 1 leaf of lettuce was kind of sad), and we both loved the butterscotch shake we split.   Service was just ok. There was some mild confusion due to the lack of hostess initially, and our guy was hard to track down when we wanted a refill on a soft drink. Overall a nice visit and I would go back.. especially with the great weather and I'd love to try the happy hour.",

    "text": "First off, I only review burgers.  This has been on my bookmarks list for a while.  Every time I drove down Las Vegas Blvd, I noticed this wedged in the Las Vegas Fashion Mall.  Yelp reviewers had it at 4 stars so it was worth checking out.  It's all outdoor seating which is kind of brutal during the summer.  I went for dinner and the misters were helpful in keeping it cool, but they also kind of mist your plate, your drink and everything else.  The waitresses are nice and the food came out quick.  The first thing I noticed about the burger was the bun.  It looked perfectly round and not too thick.  The burger was above average.  It was too dark to see the pinkness of the patty, but judging by taste and consistency, I'd say they got it right.  My cousin also ordered fried pickles.  I freaking hate pickles, but these were fried so crispy, I couldn't even taste the pickles.  Surprisingly good!  Worth going to, but if you go on a hot summer day, you might suffer a little...  WHAT I ORDERED: Main --- Special (burger, Jack Daniel sauce, cheddar, bacon): 4/5  Sides --- Fries: 3/5 Fried Pickles: 4/5  STAFF: Friendly  WAIT TIME: Short  PORTION: Average  BANG FOR YOUR BUCK: Just about right for what you get.  WOULD I RETURN: Yes, but in fall or spring",

She interacted with every patron and the bar and got them interacting with each other.   I had a pretty insane burger and fries even though I had already eaten a little earlier. The fries were very good, thin and crispy. The burger was also very good, although a little sloppy. I could have done without some of the onions and peppers inside that were making it a little soggy but the bun, pickles, patty and cheese were top notch.   I'd definitely go back to Stripburger on my next Vegas visit.",

    "text": "Good burgers: Reasonably hearty and had flavor to them. I remember the hamburger bread being incredibly soft and fluffy and still somehow kept its shape, which I really liked. I wouldn't say they have the best burgers in the world, but I think they're better than average and I wouldn't mind eating there again when I visit.   I ordered the green chili burger and thought it was OK. I took a bite of my husband's bleu cheese burger and wish I got that instead (I should've listened to the waitress' recommendation :)). I don't normally like the taste of bleu cheese and the burger was still good!  Fries: Their fries are good as well - I really liked their stringy onion rings.   Drinks: I also liked their beer mojito and it's high on my list of favorite beers (I'm not an avid beer drinker though, so my preference may not be so hot with everyone).   Service: Our waitress was nice, quick, checked in on us from time to time and also refilled our water without us asking, so it's good. I don't expect for more.   It's a good place to eat and for a reasonable price, especially considering how expensive eating in Vegas can be at some of the restaurants. For the two of us, we ordered a basket of fries, an alcoholic beverage and 2 burgers and the total came out to be around $36 w/o tip.   Hope you like it if you try!",

    "text": "I know I've been trying to avoid the touristy locations on the strip, but with all the meetings I have there it's too convenient to duck into something nearby and get back to the office. This is exactly what happened when I ventured into Stripburger the other day, and I'm glad I did. I'm starting to get very skeptical of restaurants in general located on the strip due to the fact that they don't really have to try and yet mass amounts of tourists will still flock to them, so I welcome the surprise.  Stripburger is unfortunately located on the corner sidewalk at the Fashion Show Mall across the street from the Wynn hotel. Parking is typically atrocious at the mall, but pretty much your only option unless you happen to be walking down the sidewalk in this area. There's a 99% chance you are not. What I didn't know until I arrived is that the restaurant is entirely outdoors; this is horribly inconvenient in the dead of summer, and potentially not great either come January. I suppose the awnings might help a bit in the summer although based on experience not too much, and the heat lamp that was placed directly behind me more than made up for the fact that it was overcast and maybe 55 degrees the day I was there.  Surprisingly there are several burgers to choose from on the menu, along with a slider option, a turkey burger and a veggie burger that my friend hesitantly ordered in front of me. They also offer shakes, salads, a bunch of chicken sandwiches and some other items. Plus, since this is an outdoor bar/restaurant right on the sidewalk, a large collection of cocktails are also available. I was in the mood for something simple and went with a classic cheeseburger and fresh cut fries. I quickly got worried when not only did the guy next to me get the wrong order, but when our food came out they also brought me the wrong burger. I was left with that bad situation of having fries and no burger, and the person I was eating with had their food. Luckily mine came out only a minute or two later.  The burger itself doesn't look like anything special; a decent plain bun, melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes pickles and mayo. What surprised me was how well it tasted, the meat was cooked perfectly, and had great flavor with a hint of some pepper which I liked. It was juicy but not overly messy, dripped just a bit and left a small puddle on the plate yet the meat still maintained its moisture until the end. The pickles had good flavor, the bun was buttery, and was just the right ratio to the amount of meat. It tasted great and I was happy.  The fries could have been perfect too, but I think we got a mix of old and new so some were soft and great, while others were a bit hard and stale. I think it was also scooped from the bottom as we had a lot of small pieces in the bowl. Still they were quite good, maybe a bit too salty but I really liked their overall flavor and were quite bountiful.  The price was about what one could expect for being located on the strip, I think if it were more of a local's spot I'd have more of a problem spending around $30 for two burger meals. The location isn't ideal, but if you're already over there or don't mind going near the strip as much as I do then it's definitely worth the visit.",

You have to order any sides or fries separately.  My friends and I ordered the garlic fries. Good enough to share between 3 people. HOLY SHI*.....that after garlic breathe was harsh!!! The garlic was so strong, there was a bitter taste on every few bites.  I had to mask my breath with Listerine mint strips and chewing gum for a good 3 hours. I brushed my teeth AND tongue extra long that night. I def wouldn't order that again. Should of gotten the cheese fries....oh wells...  This is all outdoor seating only. So if it's 104+ degrees...you may want to reconsider. Why go out to eat somewhere only to be sitting in your own sweat?! No thank you. Also, it's not located IN the fashion show mall. You have to walk outside to Las Vegas Blvd to access their entrance. I think the reason why people rave about this place are their milkshakes. But their burgers....nothing special at all.",

Don't fret--the misters on the patio are cranking and we were borderline cold on a July afternoon.  The caesar salad was perfect for splitting and the burgers/sandwiches were a good portion.  We both loved our lunches (minus a tad too much pepper on the burger) and we left full and happy.  Looking forward to the construction in front of the mall to be done to enhance the ambience a bit, but all in all a good choice for lunch.",

The burgers took another 25 minutes or so to arrive but still no tea.

On top of that, the floors were very sticky and dirty and as the the sun set, multiple flies arrived to join us for dinner. Maybe they wanted some tea too? When the check came, yep, we had to ask to have the charge for tea removed and that took another 15 minutes to rectify. At any rate, we won't be back, tea or no tea.",

I dined here with 4 other girls and we got various things from the ahi tuna burger, to the special, to a salad, and a milkshake! Everything we had was super delicious and the portions here are really generous.   The downside: I'm not sure if there is indoor seating but sitting outside & along the bar is perfect on a summer day in the shade!",

I can not believe I am reviewing this place because it is my secret place to go to and just veg out alone.  One of the managers at Mon Ami Gabi told me about this place 6 years ago and I always come down for some cheap $2 beers (Happy Hour) and a little dinner.   Amy the bartender is really nice and I've seen her on past visits but I'm sure she doesn't remember me.  You might think she's unfriendly at first but once you start talking to her you will then realize how cool she is. She works her butt off at the circle bar. Running around keeping customers happy and also making drinks for the servers tables.   The burgers here are good but I wouldn't expect anything less from a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. Plus Chicago chains rock!!! I know...spoken like a True Chicago Boy! Hey I've got to stand up for my city! I have no idea why they haven't opened this concept in Chicago. (I'm not a fan of there M Burger...the rip off version of In n Out)  My favorite thing here is the butter salad but now it seems to come with romaine and spinach. The salad is nice and large. It is worth the money because you will feel full. I know what your thinking...a salad in Vegas...yes after everything my body has been put through it needs this.   I also enjoyed the onion rings too. I know it's an app but it really isn't for sharing because there's only like 6 rings in here. So get your own basket! No really get your own!  This is just a great place to chill out and relax. I also love that it is outside too. There is not much of a view unless you like looking at Steve Wynn's billions towering in the desert sky. The food is priced reasonable for Vegas and the Happy Drinks will save you a bunch. Until next time strip burger.",

We sat inside because it was chilly outside and the bar was full and very loud.   Our waitress was super friendly. She even suggested that we not order fries and onion rings (because we were going to) because the portions are so large. I like when a waitress is honest and looks out for her customers. She was right! The fries are a large portion and enough to share. I ordered the BBQ burger and it was delicious. Overall, a great burger place!!",

I got the Cookie and Cream it was topped with oreo's filled with oreo's throughout the vanilla shake and more on the bottom.

Atmosphere:  You know what they say: location, location, location.  This spot was great.  We ate at about 4:00pm, and the open, airy, bar area was a nice, cool repose from the Vegas sun & heat.  Allowed for superb people watching along the strip around the mall area. I had the bacon cheddar burger.  It was done to a nice, well-cooked medium.  Was thick and juicy.  The bacon was thick and added a nice flavor.  My only complaint was the bun could have been a little sturdier.  Although it was soft and tasted great, it made the burger very messy to eat as the bun started to fall apart.  My friend had the green chile burger and his was even messier! The side order of fries was huge!  I would recommeding splitting an order between at least two people. I also had the chocolate hot fudge shake.  Very good, thick and chocolatey. The service was friendly, but a little slow and left a little to be desired.  The server forgot about my shake and had to reorder it.  I was about half-way through my meal when it arrived.  I thought he would take it off the bill, but no dice.  Oh well, Vegas luck. Overall a nice place to grab a burger on the strip, and sit and relax and kill some time between splits and double-downs.",

I ordered the famous blue cheese burger, and it was practically heaven on a bun. The meat was juicy and the ingredients were fresh. I also tried the calamari and that starter was so good. The dipping sauces they provided complimented every bite I took. Its definitely a great place to eat when feeling like a burger on the Strip.",

But oh how i was wrong. I think we sat there for fifteen minutes with not one word said to us. Then another fifteen with a greeting but no actual service. Might i add while all senior management stood around and chatted about the place. Food was alright tasting but the service was that horrible it just couldnt make up for it. Now im not too hard to get along with but when you work in the service industry and live off of tips you have to be respectful. The little bit of service we did get was awful and the girl was really bitchy. After leaving a dollar tip. Which is something i would never do...the management saw the obvious disgust in out faces and no apologies at all. Me got a condescending have a good day. I have a big mouth when service is good and bad",

Yeah the service can be a pain sometimes but let's be strategical people. Don't sit at the bar if you want food service; the bartender back there is awesome and is running her butt off behind that bar. Don't go during lunch and not expect to wait to sit down: You are at a restaurant right on the Strip outside of a Mall.

    "text": "What's more American than a juicy quarter pound burger and a good ol' fashioned milkshake?  Add some contemporary culinary sweet and savory delectables into the mix and you got Stripburger.  Located at the Fashion Show Mall, seated right on the Strip (hence its name \"Stripburger\"), one is immediately welcomed to sit in the covered patio area.  Since the whipping winds were not in effect on this particular day, my co-workers/fellow foodies and I gladly took a table on the patio.  Although I had studied the menu a few days before our burger lunch date, I still reviewed it thoughtfully once we were seated.  I hadn't changed my mind, I still wanted to give that Mexican Burger a day in court and oh, what the hell, the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake.  It's Friday after all, I figured, live a little.  Then one of my burger buddies piped up and asked, \"Do you want to order some fries?\"  Yeah, I'm living today and then some.  We couldn't decide between the sweet potato fries and the garlic herb fries until our very sweet and accommodating server responded that we could get half and half.  Let's do this.  While the three of us waited for our food, two of us got our milkshakes.  My fellow milkshake mate got a cookies and cream that looked amazing.  My shake was deliciously thick, not overly rich or peanut buttery, but just the right amount of both peanut butter and chocolate.  Noticeably, neither one of us shared with the other.  Perhaps that's a very telling thing: those shakes were just so damn good, who wants to share?  Then our food arrived and was picture perfect...kind of like the website photos.  The basket of fries was put down in front of me and I just dug into those before I even touched my burger.  It was a nice equal amount of both sweet potato and garlic fries.  Note: the sweet potato fries are sprinkled with what one of my lovely cohorts referred to as \"sugary goodness.\" I say it was sugar and spice and everything nice about those sweet potatoes.  The garlic fries were as amazing topped with fresh pressed garlic and herbs.  I finally switched my attention to the main event by cutting into my burger.    Topped with a jalapeno pepper, my burger was beautifully cooked medium rare to my specification.  It was filled with cotija cheese, cilantro, pickled red onions, jalapeno, tomato, lettuce and chipotle mayo and not a drop crumbled onto the plate, my lap or tore in half when I bit into it.  With most designer burgers or even those double stacked types piled a mile higher than a mouth can actually open, the filling usually bursts out, leaving a smooshed mess in its wake.  At the risk of being Goldilocks here, this burger was not too stuffed and not too under-stuffed but just right.   And that sums up my experience at Stripburger.  I walked away not too stuffed and definitely not under-stuffed, but just right and completely satisfied.  The service was great, the ambience for a Friday afternoon on the Strip was lovely, and the food was excellent.  I will be back to try a different burger and a different variety of fries (the atomic cheese fries piques my interest).  Perhaps next time, I will try an adult beverage with my burger (hello beer mojito).",

You can enjoy your burger while downing some great cocktails and watch the people walk by.  I agree with  Jonathan Z and say that they are about the same league as Red Robin.  They have really good selection of burgers for decent prices. The burger patty isn't anything fancy here, just your typical ground beef patty.  Don't expect any kobe beef or wagyu beef patty here.    Last time we came here for lunch, I got the green chili burger which I really enjoyed and the BF got the mexicali burger.  The only downside that I would have to say about their burgers is that it get soggy really fast.  I don't know if it's the grease or sauce they put in the burgers but even after like 30 minutes, my burger would start breaking apart.  But still good nonetheless!  My favorite here is their garlic herb fries.  A great addition to get for your burgers.  Skip the atomic cheese fries.  Too messy and not all that great.  Other than that, it's a pretty chill place to come if you're in the area.  Decently priced and decently flavored.",

Service was good everything came quick and we were checked out periodically.  Thoroughly enjoyed my 32oz drink that was orange something and came in a big jar. Totally necessary.  I wasn't thrilled with the threesome of sides, fries were good, and omg was I in love with their pickle fries, but half the basket was onion strings which I could have done without.  Coming over to offer dessert the waiter let us know that if we weren't interested in the milkshakes he could bring over the dessert menu from the Mexican place next store which is the same owner (and I guess kitchen). I kinda wish I was the one to order the chocolate cake instead of just just having a few bites.",

I just couldn't get over the fact that everything i was about to touch would contaminate my hands before i even get to my burgers.  In result we order a bottle water and drank straight out the bottle.  It was served warm.   I was in a mood for a nice burger and been wanting to try this place for some time now.  My gf and i shared Bacon Cheddar, their signature Blue Cheese Burger, and a Threesome (onions strings, fries, and pickle fries).  Our food took 22min to arrive.  When it did my gf thought our burgers were cold. And I thought for a 'signature' burger they would do something special with the blue cheese, but it was a burger with blue cheese crumbles.  My Bacon Cheddar was OK.  You have to be an idiot to mess up bacon.  Our fries also came out poorly compare to McDonald's standard.  I expected more from a establishment on the strip but this wasn't the case.  There were a mixture of greasy limp, burnt, and legitimate fries in our basket along with onion strings and deep fried pickles.  I shouldn't have to go through 5 of fries to get to1 edible potato piece.  Overall we were very, very disappointed in this place.  Nice Location, but DON'T fall this tourist trap.  I bet you can get a decent burger at a cafe or even Denny's if you're in a mood for one.  We went to InO the next night to get our burger fix.",

I think one of the biggest draws about this place is that it is easily accessible from the strip (no walking through a casino maze to find it).  Also when I went on a Saturday night, it was very low-key and there weren't many people there (this might have been a fluke however).  It is a little on the pricy side, but not too expensive as long as you share fries, but don't expect to be stuffed when you leave.  Also if you are looking for a bar, this might be a good place.

I thoroughly enjoyed the blue cheese burger ordered rare.  They nailed the texture on this one.  Had a side of garlic herb fries which were exactly how I like it, not overpowering with the smell but with a nice kick to the taste buds.  When a burger joint nails the burger, fries, and shake, how can I not give this place 5*.",

If I wasn't functioning at the brain level just before coma I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the burger as much as I did at the time, but ignorance is bliss.  Of course the highlight of my trip to Stripburger had to be my friend ordering the Shrimp Bucket, which was described as \"Peel n' Eat Shrimp\" (was she still drunk?).  One of the most important rules I live my life by is to never order anything on a menu in which they spell and \" N' \".  Second of all seafood in the desert at cheap restaurants with \"strip\" in the name is never a good choice as my friend soon learned.  The shrimp was crazy looking and apparently crazy tasting, although I hope to never find out myself.  Long story short, Stripburger is step above McDonald's a step below   TGI Fridays, and I honestly would rather eat shrimp from Long John Silvers",

There was no hostess at the front of the restaurant when we arrived, but two servers passed us and outlined they would send her right over. We were quickly seated near the bar and while the location looks small, they have several tiers of seating areas.  I tried a monkey love potion to drink and found it pretty good. Despite having Malibu in it, it just tasted like a moscow mule. Price wasn't bad though at $10. My husband stuck with beer and was pleased with their selection.  Food wise, I had the mushroom cheddar burger and my husband had the bacon cheddar burger. We were both torn over trying the slider trio and after seeing it being served to the table behind us, know it would be what we would both try next visit. Both burgers were definitely delicious and juicy. They were also cooked perfectly to our requests. We spit an order of the threesome (fries, onion straws, fried pickles) and could barely make it through half the bowl. The pickles were panko coated and amazing until I realized there was next to no pickle slice in most of them. I was just eating deliciously greasy batter. Would love for the slices to be thicker to get more pickle.  Overall we had a good visit and the food definitely left us full. Our server was very friendly and came over a couple of times to chat vs just check on us. We will definitely be back!",

It was way too late to eat a burger so I opted for a turkey cobbish salad and a side of over the top spicy chili that I could not eat so I gave it to my hub since he can stomach that kind of spice.  I was definitely not impressed by the food, the amount of food and the prices that were attached to them. My $10 salad was not worth the dough the $7 chili didn't taste that fresh and the $6 german beer was the only thing this meal had going for it.   Now concerning the cleanliness of the place, there were about 10 employees running around an almost empty restaurant but the bar area where I was seated was dirty and yucky and every table that was empty had old food and waste from previously customers.   I really wanted to love or at least like this place but so far this burger joint has 100% fallen short of what is expected from a restaurant. At this point I wish this was a smash burger joint instead of what it is. The only thing I would recommend this place for are drinks and that's it.",

This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, veggie burger I've ever eaten.   I opted to get it in the \"Famous Bleu\" setup. There are no words to describe this other than saying \"Imagine eating the perfect burger.\" I don't take pictures of my food. This day, I took a picture of my food. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries. Again, delicious. Flavorful. Came with a great side sauce. And HUGE portions. Big enough for two.  You cannot beat going here, especially for lunch.

That's not their fault but holy crap did it make for a horrible dining experience.   I can't even remember what burger I ordered but I know I didn't like it that much. We had the garlic fries and they were SO soggy and didn't taste great.   I think we just came on a bad day based on some of the other reviews.. I'd give Stripburger another try but maybe for dinner when it's a lot busier, more upbeat, etc.",

The buns are fresh and squishy and the sides such as the sweet potato fries and onion strings are divine. When we were there, our ticket got stuck in the machine and so our order was delayed. The manager came right over and apologized and let us know that there was going to be a short wait because of this happening. He stayed and talked with us and made sure that we were happy while waiting for our food.   This is an open air restaurant and so be prepared to dress according to the weather. There are nice views of the strip and it is fun people watching as you eat your food.",

As far as the shakes go, the Salted Caramel Shake with Bailey's is pretty good. Be wary, it will fill you up though.   Service was on the plus side.   To summarize, come for the shakes and skip the burgers.",

    "text": "Located outside the Fashion Show Mall this is a burger, fries, and alcohol place. So I have mixed feelings about this place. I went to place a to go order and so had to order at the bar. The customer service at the bar was terrible. The lady at the bar barely acknowledged my presence and didn't even bother to ask me details about my order. I got the cheeseburger and she didn't even ask what kind of cheese I wanted. Also the entire time I sat there (10 to 15 min) she never even asked if I wanted a drink, even water. Her customer service was so bad that I was really turned off from this place, but the other servers who were greeting customers who wanted a table all seemed really friendly so I can't say it's everybody who works there.   Of course then I had the food and I was really pleased. The cheeseburger was great. Nice  and juicy with your typical toppings. Even eating it after walking back to my hotel in the cold, it tasted great. I didn't get the fries, which seem to have mixed reviews, but I did get the chocolate shake, which was also really good. The only other downside is that this place is pretty expensive. $11 for a cheeseburger and $6 for a shake. But I guess for Vegas located right off the strip, it's decent. I'd come back here again, I just hope I'd get better customer service.",

Big to the point where it was falling apart and I couldn't eat it properly. The lettuce was very cold and took away from the taste!

We're a but of burger connoisseurs, so trust me when I say that everying about it was perfect. Great flavor, wasn't soggy at all, perfect portion size, just absolutely delicious. I might suggest getting light jalapenos just because it tastes so good that you dont want to NOT be able to taste it over the spice:) The fries were perfect and crispy, and they had so many options if ways to make them better! The service was quick and our waitress was incredibly sweet! Plus, there are rainbow stairs right outside, perfect for a tourist photo op! I strongly sugggest giving this place a try next time you find yourself on the strip!",

Seating wasn't an issue [it was WAY too hot to sit outside so we sat inside .. but then it got WAY too cold haha].  The servers were very attentive although we were sitting inside and were constantly checking up on us. We got the sampler are our appetizer .. and the fries were not fresh :( We were a fan of the onion strings & I believe, fried pickles? Our Whiskey BBQ & blue cheese burgers were rather dry and we were not impressed although we wanted to be. The alcoholic milkshakes weren't bad but I wasn't sure if they were supposed to taste any differently than normal milkshakes? Prices weren't bad and service was great but I'm not sure if we will be returning [unless it's for happy hour or with friends].",

I went with the salted caramel with baileys. I couldn't stop drinking it!   The service was ok. It seemed like once we got our food, we didn't see them for a while, and it took some time for us to finally get our check. Still, it was a good choice to come here.

My sister and MIL decided to share the Mini burger sampler and sweet potato fries.   When our burger arrived, I was a little disappointed because the portion was not generous. However, the taste was good. I really enjoyed it. As we were done eating the burger, hubby was still a little hungry. Luckily, we had a generous portion of fries so he decided to satisfy his hunger by eating all of the fries. The garlic herb fries were really good as well and I highly recommend. I tried a few of the sweet potato fries and I wasn't a fan.   For two entrees, two order of fries and a few soft drinks, our order was a little over $30 which isn't bad.",

The place was dead for lunch on a Saturday so there was no problem getting a table.  Our waitress greeted us quickly and let us know about the burger special. The menu had many delicious sounding options. I decided on the mini burger sampler which included a blue cheese burger, whiskey burger, and cheddar burger. It didn't come with fries which was fine because I wanted to try the trio of fries, onion strings, and pickle chips. My husband quickly decided on the bison burger topped with a fried Hatch chile and served with fries. He also ordered a cookies-n-cream milkshake.  The cookies-n-cream milkshake is amazing. I couldn't stop stealing sips of it. I also like that they serve it on the thicker side so that it isn't a melted mess in the Vegas heat as soon as it is served. The burger sampler was a good portion of food and easier to eat than one big burger. They weren't bad burgers, but the amazing flavor I anticipated just wasn't there. I can't say it was one of the best burgers that I've had. My husband felt the same way about his burger. I'd say the same for the fries and onion strings. The pickle chips were okay, but didn't contain much pickle.   Overall, there isn't anything terribly wrong with this place, but it isn't the best option in the area for burgers.",

We all got burgers. I found out they will lettuce wrap any sandwich or burger you would like for those of us who can't eat bready goodness. They were all cooked to perfection. Seasoned well and super juicy, not greasy. The kids bacon cheeseburgers were gone before we could ask how they tasted. My Mex burger was so good. We got cheese and garlic fries they were also very tasty. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. Could not have asked for a better low key dinner on the strip!",

And it's in the form of Stripburger.  It's located right across from the Wynn in the shopping center which was perfect for my friends and I. We walked over one day before dinner and were pleasantly surprised by everything. Our only complaint about the burger is that it couldn't hold itself together. Everything was dripping everywhere and falling apart. My bun was soggy before I even got halfway through the burger. Regardless, it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were good but there was a little too much of the sugar/salt mix on it and I had to scrape it off.   The portions are huge! The burger was probably around the size of my face. And if you order a gourmet burger, then it comes with fries. That factors to be about $20 with tip. Definitely a solid deal if you're in Vegas.   Stripburger lost the 0.5 stars because the burger couldn't hold up. It's one of the things that really stresses me out when I'm eating and if the burger was stacked properly, I feel like everything would have been okay. I bumped it up to four because of the value.",

    "text": "The reason for 3 stars and not 5 is because of the service. We went there about 9:00 p.m. I was reluctant to sit outside because it was cold, however, they had nice strong heaters thst they kept on the whole time so it was so warm and toasty. The food was amazing. Many different things were ordered but they all tasted amazing and everybody scrafed theirs down pretty quickly.  What went wrong was the way we were served. So there were 5 adults in our group and 2 kids, normally, restaurants do not technically count the kids as \"people\" for their table headcount, but this waiter did and they automaticlly charged about 19% for gratuity from us. That's probably why the service was so terrible because he knew he was getting a tip either way.  Anyway, my boyfriend got 3 refills and each refill he had to ask for. We saw our waiter like 3 times and each time he was uninterested and coming out from a casual conversation he was having with his co-workers. It was not busy at all the time we went, so there was no reason to not have his attention.   He made no conversation, wrote our orders down wrong, and he wasn't even the one serving our food to us. When we told him we wanted our bill split, he was annoyed. He took forever to split them, probably because of the conversation he was carrying on the whole time with another associate, and when he came back he basically just handed them to us and washed his hands of us. Didn't ask how it was or anything.  He ended up making about $50 on tips just from us and gave us trashy service.   I would definitely go back because the food was so amazing, but if I got him again, I'd request a different server.   Pros: Amazing food, caters outside to the weather appropriately Cons: Terrible customer service",

We came around 10-12 am, and there was a happy hour going on. TWO DOLLARS for well drinks and beers. No. WAY. The service was great, everything came quickly and it wasn't crowded at all.  Or if you are a clubber come here after making bad choices and fix your night.  The burgers were all phenomenal. I went with one of the specials (comes with fries!) and it was perfectly cooked, flavorful and, just, wow. This was my favorite Vegas find.   I took a picture of my burger but the whole place is Green so it didn't turn out well.  Load yourself up on $2 well drinks and beers and walk around the strip. This is how Vegas should be.",

    "text": "You know I was mildly torn betweena four and a five star review here and then realized taken in its totality Strip Burger is definitely a five! First, the important stuff the burgers! Having eaten here twenty times plus the burgers are always perfectly cook and so juicy! I prefer going medium with my burger and with the southwestern burger it is a perfect choice.  The peppers are  sweet and spicy and matched the burger and bun just right. The pickle fries are  excellent and have paired nicely with any burger on the menu. If you happen to find yourself at Strip burger during happy hour you are in for a treat. The beer menu is solid and the prices are fantastic. One of my favorite happy hour cocktails is the vodka lemonade with a sprig of rosemary. So tasty! If you have room get a signature shake to go they even make them with alcohol if you prefer. Overall a fabulous burger spot and a great way to kick off a day or night hitting the strip.",

    "text": "What piece of my soul Vegas took the night before, Stripburger returned...  I have to admit expectations were low, as was my will to live the afternoon I visited Stripburger. But was very happily surprised upon entering the open-air burger bar.  Now, before I could really take this place in, I ordered a beer - because that is the only thing to do when you are hunger over. Then, I looked at the menu. Firstly, 'Adult Shakes' I mean, ice-cream + alcohol, this place could be heaven.  Then, the burgers. From classic to Mexican, they had it all. My fiance went the Bacon Cheese Burger. Because Bacon. Under the recommendation of our server, I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger with Crispy Onion. Now, I don't want to alarm you. BUT, also bacon. Yes, our server recommended adding bacon to the Blue Cheese burger. I'll note here in my review that I am 99.9% sure she was an angel, but I digress. Because ginormous burgers are never enough we also ordered the sweet potato fries.  Spoiler alert. I died.   These burgers were insanely good. While Vegas isn't known for 'real' these burgers were the exception. Juicy medium cooked beef, perfect toppings (they didn't skimp at all) and better buns than you see at a Vegas review... (well, maybe).   I love you Stripburger. Vegas, while my liver cannot handle you, my stomach is ready to come back here.",

Our server was Matt and I loved the service. He was very attentive and calm. For drinks, I ordered the jacked arnie palmer (which was basically half lemonade & half iced tea with Jack Daniels in it) I ordered the Blue Cheese burger which apparently was the most popular. The burger was.....okay. No big deal honestly, but it does the job if you are hungry. The fries were actually pretty good, came out hot with a nice crunch. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a quite bite before or after drinking. Just another burger place.",

If I were to make a recommendation I would suggest two milkshakes: 1) the tres leche milkshake is vanilla based and has Kahlua and a literal piece of cake in it! It is just too decadent for words...get one (or three if you're hungry) and 2) the salted caramel is yummy and delicious with baileys in it.   We also had a great server who had some Intense eye contact, Wysouri was most attentive!!!  If you're looking for a place to cool off in Vegas, this is seriously the spot! They have water spritzers at the bar and adult milkshakes! Exactly what you need in 113 degree heat!!",

It's located on the strip side of the Fashionshow Mall so you can conveniently park for FREE on the east side of the mall garage OR if you valet park which is along the back side of the restaurant you can ask them for a coupon and they usually have 25% cards for Stripburger. They're pretty reasonably priced and sides such as fries are a la carte but they're large portions served in big bowls to share.   *Housemade veggie patty can be substituted it in any burger too! Food wise i recommend ordering off of the current \"specials\" menu which has seasonal burgers, fries, and drinks that are not found on the normal menu. They have a full bar as well so you can get basically any drink. They also usually have chalk board outside their steps that have drink offers such as i've gotten a \"black and tan\" for $3 on St. Patty's day or when the temperatures are really high they sell PBR to match the temperature (so 108 degrees was $1.08 PBRs for the day).   It's all outdoor seating however it's in the shadows of the mall all day and they have a fully covered top and wind guards with misters, fans and heat lamps for the winters.  The restaurant group also owns their neighbor restaurant El Segundo Sol which i also recommend if you want to dine inside.",

I've been here numerous times and with each visit, the food and service has always been on point. Across the street from Wynn and on the north corner end of Fashion Show Mall. Full bar and outdoor patio dining. Great place to people watch because you are on the heart of the strip. Reasonable prices for a burger joint with a lively ambiance.   On this visit, I tried their Double Raspberry Vanilla Shake. OMG...so delish!! Fresh raspberries, vanilla ice cream, raspberry puree, vanilla flavored vodka, topped with real whip cream. Thick, creamy and with a slight tart tang from the fresh berries that help cut a little of the sweetness of the shake to pure perfection.   I highly recommend Stripburger to satisfy your burger, fries and milkshake cravings! Oh, and don't worry if you are not in the mood for a burger. They also serve buffalo chicken wings and they are very good! Salads too but come on...why would you order a salad at a burger joint! Lol... ;)",

Will never go back to a place that doesn't honor coupons that they clearly had an agreement to accept. Remember the \"never expires part? Our coupon isn't worth the paper it is written on.",

When I'm paying for to eat on the Las Vegas strip, for like a 70.00 burger and fry meal, I expect to be and feel a certain way. When this place first opened, they had way better service, way better drinks. Overall the service in Las Vegas (as a whole) is starting to tank, but the prices keep going up! 2 stars is being generous. The only reason why this place is even open is because of the foot traffic and curiosity of passing patrons. In closing they use to have misters.

    "text": "Confession, I can only review one thing: The boozy milkshakes. They were soooo good, I had to come and write a review!  Okay, I guess I can review the location and such a bit. It's on the exterior corner of a mall on the Las Vegas strip. It's a cute spot, outside but covered. You can pedestrian and car watch, and it's nice that right across the street is trees rather than a business.    We sat at the round bar, the bartender greeted us quickly and warmly. She presented us full menu's and gave us water while we pondered our milkshake options.  There weren't many, but all of them sounded amazing. I waffled between the Vanilla Vodka Dreamsicle or the Chocolate with Jack Daniel's. Other options include Tres Leches with Kahlua and the Rasberry with Chambord. All sound super yummy, right?! We both ended up with the Chocolate/JD, a rich and thick concoction with just the right amount of everything.   The bartender checked on us several times, and though we didn't eat the menu looked great. I look forward to venturing back for another try, and maybe - MAYBE - getting past the milkshakes.",

To be honest, the menu items sounded simple and plain, but then I realized that the burgers are STRIPPED of all the frilly, unnecessary ingredients! Actually I'm not sure if that's why it's called Stripburger. Might have something to do with the Las Vegas Strip.  I ordered the Swiss and Bacon Burger, which was a special on the menu. I said medium rare, and I got... Medium rare! Hallelujah. My burger was prepared perfectly. Juicy, flavorful, and just greasy enough. The fries we got were okay. I would love to try more menu items next time, especially after a night (or day) of Vegas drinking to build up my appetite!",

My wife had the turkey burger. I expected ground turkey meat, but it was really a turkey breast sandwich, and she loved it. She was trying to eat \"healthier,\" but craving a burger so she thought this would be a good compromise. After she tasted it, she said it was not a compromise, it was a great burger.   I had the bleu cheese burger, and it was cooked perfectly (medium, as ordered) and every bite was delicious.   We shared an order of garlic fries. They were very good, and the dipping sauce was a nice complement to them. We both agreed we'd have liked the fries a little crispier but they were not soggy or undercooked by any means.

The wow factor of this place is their burger and fries.   First the burgers. I have had tried them all but the mexican burger is the best. I was introduced to this a while back before it was even on the menu. Chipotle Mayo, pickled red onions, Jalapeno,  Cotilla Cheese, Cilantro, and a roasted Jalapeno stabbed into the top of the bun with a toothpick. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. You must get their green homemade \"Chuy\" sauce with it. It is spicy and a delight to the taste buds. If Amy(great bartender) is there she serves it with every Mexican burger.  Next up is the Garlic fries, lots of fresh garlic spices. Big enough to share but just like grandma when you got close to her pies you will be slapping an intruders hand.   Not only are the libations cheap for happy hr, full bar is $1 after nine. Their regular fries and sliders are half off. All of the seating is outside but they have heaters for when it's cold and fans for the warm dessert summers. I have never once had subpar service at a table or the bar.",

Sadly, the fries at Stripburger weren't the best, but I did like my sliders: 100% all-natural beef patties with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and mayo. Although the meat was seasoned well, I can't deny the fact that the egg buns dwarfed the meat because it was so thin. On the other hand, the bf's bacon cheeseburger was great! It happened to be a \"special\" that day so the fries were included (otherwise, it'll be close to $10 for a burger and you don't even get a side of fries!) I wanted to kickstart my weekend with a Gin & Tonic and it was good to see a variety of gin selection on the shelf including Tanquery 10. Sports fans who feel like having a beer while watching the game won't feel left out with several beers on draft served in 16 oz. glasses, for less than $5. The blonde bartender who helped us out was gracious and friendly.  This all outdoor restaurant has premium space at Fashion Show Mall and is conveniently located across the Wynn hotel.

I heard some good things about Stripburger, so thought I would give them another shot.    Even though all of the seating is outdoors, they have some pretty strong fans and a lot of misters.  I sat at the bar and was totally comfortable throughout my meal, despite the triple digit temperature outside.  Service was quick, I was immediately approached by the bartender and received my burger after about 12 minutes.  I opted for the jalapeno popper burger, which has the typical burger veggies, bacon, jalapeno and fried cheddar.  The fried cheddar is what lured me in, and it was fantastic.  It was crispy and added great texture to the burger to go with the cheesy flavor.  I could have used more jalapeno, I'll order extra when I get the burger again.  My main issue with the burger was I ordered it medium and it came out medium well at best.  Still had some juice, but it was certainly overcooked.    On the side, I had the onion strings.  You get a huge basket for $3.95, easily enough to share.  I liked them, but they could have been a little thicker for my taste, they were extremely thin strings.  But, great crunch and nice onion flavor.    Had the burger been cooked to medium and the onion strings a little thicker, this would be a 4 star review.  But, it was much better than I remember, and I'll be back next time I have to go to the mall.",

Very meaty and superb quality wings. While I very much wish they were buffalo wings as opposed to just BBQ wings, the flavor is good nonetheless. And the blue cheese for dipping is excellent.  Chicken nachos: Fantastic! Large portion, pulled chicken tasted great, lots of cilantro, and so on. The flavors are incredible.  I've worried that they are trying to expand too much, which could jeopardize quality. But so far, so good. Still never disappointed with the food.",

Although, I was happy we ordered the fries and onion strings basket because that was the best part of the meal.   Perk- my husband got a burger medium and it actually came out medium. Go figure. I got the chicken sandwich that was nothing to write home about.  Con: all seating is outside. So if it's hot, you will not be cooling down here... and, um, well, we live in LAS VEGAS which might as well be called city on the surface of the sun with pavement. And well, on those rare chilly nights? You can then be burned to death by their outside heaters. This place is HOT HOT HOT, but in all the wrong ways...",

So creamy and what a real burger should taste like. Had fresh guacamole and chips. The waitress suggested she get it for us from the place next door (same company)... so worth it! We cleaned the bowl dry. Garlic fries were made w real fresh chopped garlic, soooo good. Pricing was totally affordable. Great drink menu. Great service. Can't complain about a thing about Stripburger... thus the 5 star. Oh wait, they were out of the pickle fries... guess we gotta go back ;)",

But low and behold, they don't have wheat buns.  They don't have WHEAT BUNS!?!????  You're a burger place and you don't have wheat buns?  Ok...  You serve \"healthier\" options like turkey, veggie, and even ahi tuna burgers, but NO WHEAT BUNS?  You guys aren't so bright.  Especially being so close to California, how do you not have wheat buns.  Ok, so whatever.  I get over it and order a salad.. The Veggie Salad.  So my salad had these shabby pieces of yellow lettuce (except for the one piece of wilted green lettuce) and like three pieces of chicken (which I paid extra for to add) on.  The \"vinaigrette\" was nothing but salted oil.  Burnt and soggy vegetables.  Basically it was just a horrible experience.. ESPECIALLY for being on the \"Strip\".  I would never eat here again.  Not even for free.",

We were cooled nicely by the misters on the patio & it was a decent people watching spot.  We had: PICKLE CHIPS which were quite tasty. They were a bit over fried; the sauce was flavorful, but too thin for my liking.  BLEU CHEESE BURGER I loved it even more so than the BBQ Bacon Burger, which I thought I would love more...The burgers were ordered MR, but were served Med-Med/Well. Our server told us that customers were complaining the burgers weren't cooked enough. I am from the school of \"you can always cook it more, but you can't cook it less.\" I will order my burger RARE next time! Normally, I would have sent it back, but they were still so juicy, falling apart (due to the natural meat?) and flavorful that I didn't mind. The buns were great too!  HOUSE CUT FRIES were good too, but nothing fantastic.  We both did PBR on draft (32oz). I know eeeewww if you may. You can keep the souvenir glass as well. It's plastic, but it did manage to keep our beers cool even with 100+ temps. Next time I'll imbibe in some of their delish sounding cocktails.  We had no room for dessert. Oh & you can add a shot to their milkshakes as well.  Over all the service & experience was quite good & we would go back.  The bill came to $50 including tip.  Side note: they did misspell Wagyu on the menu...",

Definitely the bar seating is the best or the high tops nearer to the strip.  Great for people watching and taking in the view of the Wynn and Encore across the street.    The prices are good and so are the burgers.  I had the Bleu Cheese Burger cook medium rare, which is what I got with no frills or fuss.  I also tried the spicy cheese fries which were pretty good, but could of been spicer.    Overall good.  The bar service a little slow, moreso because it seems as though the bartender had to fill table orders and neglect the people sitting at the bar.  This overloaded her.  Go.  Dafe",

I think the meat blend for the burgers, it didn't taste as premium as others...a nice char on the burger would have been good.  Gazpacho was great though and the cheese fries were rather amazing.

Anything with a seat that served bread would have done. LUCKILY for us there was a burger joint within walking distance, or rolling distance (it was really that close).   Let's get to the chase, the burgers are solid! Beef patty were  well grilled, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Since it was my first time here, I ordered the sliders (3 different mini burgers) and the threesome (pickle fries, fries, and thin onion thingies). Pickle fries are awesome like most yelpers stated, fries are fries, but I didn't care too much for the thin deep fried onions.   If you like spicy dips, get the \"chewey\" dip. Not sure what's in there but it has a sharp punch that leaves you wanting water asap.  Those who can't handle spicy foods need not to try.  Highly recommended if you feel like a good affordable Vegas burger. My wife says, and I quote \"... I think this is the best burger I've ever had!\"",

The doors to the actual inside area are filthy and covered with fingerprints and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a few years.   The outside table was clean but the white chairs they seat you in are filthy too covered in dirty fingerprints and years of dirt buildup.     We ordered sodas and my soda came in a dirty glass with dried mustard on the side.   I was quickly losing faith that this was going to be a good experience.   I just kept smelling that awful sour smell as did my husband.    I ordered the mini burger trio and my husband the bacon cheeseburger.  We shared an order of garlic herb fries.  Definitely share sides if you come here because they are more than enough for one person.    The mini burger trio was just okay and I say just okay because it there was barely any meat and a lot of bun.  The best kind of burger was the blue cheese burger so I wish I would have just ordered that on its own.  My husband said his burger was alright but the construction of it was awful.  They put the tomato on the bottom which caused the bottom bun to disinegrate before he could even finish his sandwich.    The final bill came to over 40 dollars which I think is pretty spendy for what you get here but it is the Strip so it wasn't that bad.   This place would be much more fun to eat at if the owners hadn't let it get so run down and smelly.    I'd eat here again but only if it was given a thorough cleaning.",

It comes with Chipoltle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapenos and Contija cheese.  It normally comes with cilantro but I hate cilantro and asked for them to leave it off.    The combination of flavors is great.  As usual I also ordered some of their Atomic Cheese Fries.   As always they were great.  I ordered a 32 oz. whiskey sour to go with lunch.  It was also tasty.",

    "text": "Be prepared to wait.  I work in Fashion Show Mall, and my store receives a 1 hour lunch break.  Getting a burger, drink, and check in this amount of time is extremely difficult for the servers at Stripburger.  I've had a bit better luck at the bar, but the table service servers over a three year period have really just not gotten it together.  I'm pretty sure my trip today was our last.  We had to find a waitress three times.  Once, a drink was just subpar.  The second time was to replace the cold french fries that were delivered to the table.  The third was to get the check.  We poured our own water glasses as we were lucky to be sat next to the hostess stand where they keep pitchers for the waitresses.  I just stood up and grabbed glasses and poured them.  Green chili burger wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  Oh, and be forewarned - the menu may show the toppings but fail to also state that EVERY burger comes with tomato, lettuce, and mayo.  I had to get a second bottom bun to get rid of the nastiness of mayo.  Friends ordered a Jack Arnold Palmer.  Don't bother.  The Jack Daniels was a short shot on the bottom of an Arnold Palmer, not mixed, and doesn't mix in well.  Friends also ordered the cheese fries.  Be forewarned: there may be shredded cheddar on top, but it's a velveta like sauce under it.  Didn't taste great.  Long and short, you're on the strip.  There's better food.  There are definitely better burgers in Vegas (usually off strip, burgers are kinda the food around here for some reason.)  Don't bother with this place.",

My server Nathan was very attentive and friendly. He suggested a new menu item and described it thoroughly. Sounded delicious but included stuff I don't include in my diet so I ordered off the menu. I have to say it was a pretty darn good burger. I ordered a turkey mushroom cheddar burger with a side of garlic fries. Yummy! The turkey burger was very tasty, not dried out like it can be if over cooked, and flavorful. I was impressed with the butter grilled bun and hefty slice of melted cheddar cheese. The garlic fries were awesome. Freshly cooked to order. They use fresh minced garlic and parsley. I like my fries a bit more salty but these were great. Overall a great lil burger joint. I little on the loud side regarding atmosphere but still a fun place to eat. Check it out",

    "text": "2:30 p.m.   After a day of shopping and having not eaten much of anything since we woke up, myself, my wife, and my friends decided we HAD to try this place out (It was recommended to my friend by a coworker of his). We sit down and order our drinks while we decide what's for lunch. Our waitress brings us only 2 waters even though there was 4 of us. They don't even have ice or the lemon we requested. We wait for her to return to ask for both straws and 2 more waters. We finally have to ask another waitress for both.  2:50 p.m.  Our waitress returns and takes our orders. Me, my friend, and his gf order burgers and cheese fries. My wife orders a bacon ranch salad. I also ordered an Oreo shake.  3:20p.m.  Our food arrives; delivered by a server. . We all want ranch sauce, but we haven't had our waitress come by since we ordered.   3:40ish  Still no sign of our waitress or my shake. I finally have to ask for ranch from a server. My food is pretty good. My wife's salad however, has sand in it. She's disgusted. I ask to speak with the a supervisor, since I've been starting to get pissed off with this whole experience. He comes out, sees us, yet incredulously decides it's more important to talk to his friends, who are seated at a nearby table, about what they're doing today/tonight. He finally comes over to our table and I explain that her salad has sand in it. He insincerely apologizes and leaves with the salad.   3:50p.m.   Fed up with the whole not being served, I FIND my waitress who's hidden down by the bar. Before I can even say anything to her, she blurts \"my manager is taking care of everything.\" WTF! All I wanted to tell her is that I don't want either the shake that I have yet to receive or the sand salad remake.   3:52p.m.   The manager comes out with both my shake and my wife's salad. I tell him to take them off our bill and that we didn't want them. He tried to tell us that it wasn't sand, it was finely ground pepper. BULLSHIT! I think my wife can tell the difference. Does pepper grind in your teeth like eating a sandwich when you're at the beach? NO!  4:06p.m.   Our waitress decides she wants to give us our bill. I pay and tip a red cent. Worst service ever! From the top down, it's very unprofessional. I hate complaining, but seriously, it took over an hour just to see our waitress again and I was the one who had to hunt her down.   Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Somewhere that actually wants your service.",

I sat at the bar and ordered a turkey burger with pepper jack and a small salad to go - easy enough, right?  First they brought out a to-go bag with only the salad... the barback went back and 5 min later brought out a turkey burger.  I asked if it was turkey w/pepper jack and he said he didn't know so asked the barternder.  She said yes.  ?  Then there wasn't silverware or condiments in the bag, so the barback had to go back and retreive those as well.  So, when I got back to the hotel to eat/work, there was no pepper jack.  I paid for cheese, certainly WAITED for cheese, but did I get cheese?  No, I got a mediocre burger so over-seasoned with pepper it was almost inedible.  (and I LOVE pepper, btw!)

That's the only reason this place was considered prior to our group taking the trip to Vegas. Our coupon was a $100 gift certificate for $200 (or more) of food and drink.  So now for the food.....it was.....well, good! Quite a few of us had the turkey burger (we added guacamole). There was nothing super extravagant about it, but it was definitely a good turkey burger. Our table had the trifecta of fries: fresh-cut, garlic herb, and sweet potato. The sweet potato fries were the only ones that did not get devoured. They just didn't work for us. Kinda gross actually. A few of us actually went back the next day for late night eats. I had the Ahi Tuna burger. Good and unique tasting, but that's all. Just....good.  Now, if you're a drinker you might have came to the right place! The Jumbo Cocktails will get you where you need to go....if you're choosing to go \"there\" (this is where the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon really comes in handy). They come in 16 and 32oz. mason jars. The 32oz. Tableside Margarita won't disappoint you! Also, be careful! Some of the people in our party had some drinks that were not too tasty. I'm not sure which ones they are, but get a quick taste before your waiter/waitress leaves the table in case you need to send it back and order something else.  Overall, it was a great experience! Great waiter, great atmosphere, great weather, great drinks, and uh....good food :-)",

    "text": "TO START OFF WE WAITED OVER 30 Minutes FOR A TABLE! not too sure because I had my daughter with me (As we all know Las Vegas is not a kid friendly town)when we finally got seated it was by the kitchen and there was no forks just 1 plate..so we sat for 5 minutes for the waitress to see that we have been seated in her area-NO Hello ,SORRY FOR THE WAIT-It was\"so what will you have\"! When the food did arrive my daughter burger was burn't- we ask for it to be a little pink-NOT burnt to a crisp, my chicken burger was dry as the desert and had too many fluff on it to hide the dry flesh that was once a chicken..To sum up strip Burger is it like the Elvis impersonator's it 's just wrong",

    "text": "Ended up eating here when I stayed at the Wynn across the street.  We saw the restaurant from our hotel window looking out and thought we'd give it a shot.  Burgers were decent, and cooked well enough where it came out juicy and non dry.  Very tasty.  Not of the Burger Bar quality but good none the less considering its mall food.  The fries were cooked much differently and had a bit of a dry taste to it.  It worked though and tasted good.  I would eat here again if I needed a quick meal and was in the passing area.  Customer service was good, server was attentive.  On the downside this is a outside restaurant where you eat outside...there was a few bees floating around during our meal which was a bit of a annoyance.  But you can't control mother nature I guess.",
