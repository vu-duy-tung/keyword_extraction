    "text": "I saw in another review that this is owned by The Cheesecake Factory and in hindsight, it makes total sense. Large variety to choose from no matter the time of day (or night), huge portions, super tasty food. My hubby and I come here for the cream of chicken soup, of which I am typically not a fan. The first time I tried it, I was hesitant but since I was guaranteed to love it, I had nothing to lose. The first bite was okay, the second bite was pretty good, by the third bite, I was sold! Now I can't come to LV without having it at least once. Outstanding service every time.",

It was almost 1am so he suggested here, I shoulda been against it (since his picks ALWAYS suck) but was like ok! So we get there and theres hella ppl! I was thinking to myself, this place has to be yummy!  Boy o boy, I opened the menu and was like \"WTF!\" ok, lemme tell you... I'm a cheap date! I think its absurd to spend more than 10$ on a meal! Even though my bf was paying I was just irritated. I really wanted a club sandwich and seen one listed.. for 12$!!!! I scanned the menu and seen that everything was pretty much 12$+ and also everything they had on the \"late night\" menu didnt sound yummy. So I got the club.  We both got it and it came to our table... OK, when I think of a club I think of a double decker sandwich... not a plain 2 pieces of bread sandwich! This thing was 2 pieces of bread, arugula, turkey, and bacon. Uhmmmm LAME! The fries were good, but I wasnt pleased with my sandwich. I left irritated and will probably not go back!! The server was nice, and the place itself is very beautiful, but like I said I'm a cheap bastard. I didnt think the quality of the food was worth it.",

The nice thing is that they aren't price gouging (as they easily could) considering its location within the Venetian.  Service was excellent. Our waitress was extremely attentive providing refills, more bread, and the check promptly. She was also very friendly and provided a lot of options that were recommended by her and frequently by guests.   I ordered the caramel chicken which came with a large portion of rice. This was a massive portion and I could only eat half of it even though I was very hungry. The chicken was very good and nice and crispy. Very similar to an orange chicken from a chain restaurant but a bit sweeter and overall tasted better.  Overall, great restaurant.. large portions, great service, and affordable.",

PROS: -  Located inside the Venetian.  That's a pro in my book since no matter where I stay in Vegas, I always end up somewhere near the Venetian. -  Place is open late!!  Is this place 24 hours?  I'm not sure, but I love the fact that you can go clubbing and come here afterwards. -  Service is fantastic!  We got our food efficiently, everything came out for our group together, and she was attentive. -  Food quality is just delicious!  I got their Chicken Carbonara and it was so creamy.  Bacon bits in there were thick and juicy.  I could have licked the whole plate clean.  Bread they give you was also fluffy and chewy.  Yum!!  -  Ambiance is beautiful!  It's like Cheesecake Factory but a notch fancier. -  There is so much variety with food selection, so this is perfect for if you are in Vegas with a group.  Everybody can find SOMETHING to order on the menu.  CONS: I have none!  That's why this place is getting all 5 stars from me ;)",

    "text": "My parents have been talking about the ribs and ahi salad they got at the Venetian the last time they were there.  So last weekend, we do the walk from the Aria to the Venetian (really long walk) in search of this restaurant. It seems counterintuitive that this great food comes out of this normal looking casino restaurant, but it really was good.   I've been on a pasta carbonara fix (trying to relive my amazing Rome dining experience), so I ordered it with low expectations since every other place has been terrible. I have to say that this was the best pasta carbonara that I've had outside of Rome. It was a very cheesy cream sauce and with actual thick cut bacon. The whole meal tasted like smoked bacon. The lunch portion was huge and since it was very rich, I couldn't finish it. My husband ordered the short rib burger (short ribs are a topping on the burger) and he liked it a lot. Dad ordered the ribs and mom the ahi salad, which they both loved just as much the first time.   Unfortunately, there were some cons. My husband's burger came without any dressings/sauces, which is a little strange. He had to ask for mayo and our server said he'd have to go to the kitchen to get it. My mom asked for soy sauce and wasabi. Our server told us they only had soy sauce, which was a lie because they had a wasabi dressing for the ahi appetizer. I suspect the wasabi dressing was in the kitchen and our server didn't want to go back after retrieving the mayo.  All in all, I'd definitely go back and I'd order the pasta carbonara (maybe to share next time) in a heart beat.",

It's simple and uncomplicated and overall, a really good deal. There's a great variety of pastries, fruit, yogurt, and bread. Eggs are available but there's an omelette station that is way more worth your time. A good selection of toppings and I saw some of them making eggs to order for people who didn't want the scrambled eggs already put out. There's hash, bacon, sausage, and waffles.  Drinks are included- this is huge! Coffee is almost $5 and juice is almost $7 so I got both.   While the overall buffet is not large or glamorous it's a great deal considering it's on the strip (in the Venetian). If you're looking at any egg dish on the menu and a beverage, may as well go for the buffet.",

After waiting for about 18 mins, not being acknowledged by ANYONE, my boyfriend decided to ask the server attending the table next to us to please call our server over but instead she said she could take our order herself. When our original server finally appeared again, she seemed very upset with us. She stopped by our table only twice, the second time bringing us the check, mind you we were nowhere near being finished with our food. I felt like we deserved an apology or at least an explanation as to why we were hanging for so long but instead we received discourteous service. What a shame.   Food was bomb though!",

My stomach couldn't wait, but I really wanted to try the breakfast items here after seeing pictures on yelp. We stood in line and asked the hostess how long it would take. She quoted us 5-10 minutes and before you know it, 5 minutes is up and we were seated. Don't overestimate the long lines, this cafe is huge and comes with lots of indoor and outdoor seating so the lines move fast. I'm so happy we got to try this place because it truly did not disappoint! What we ordered:  -Freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice: fresh and worth every penny! The grapefruit juice is a bit bitter for my taste but if you like the fruit, you'll like the juice. Served in wine glasses so the portions are on the smaller side. -Grand lux french toast with strawberries: perfect! Six pieces of thick toast sprinkled with powered sugar, strawberries, and maple syrup.  -Eggs bendict with hashbrowns: perfectly poached eggs atop canadian bacon and an english muffin drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Dish comes with hash browns on the side.   I highly recommend all the dishes we tried and will definitely come back again soon!",

We were four gals and each ordered their own thing and we tasted a little bit from each other  I had the Spicy Ginger Beef - off the Foods of the world menu and every bite was delicious.  This place set the standard for my tastebuds in sin city.  The tenderloin was like butter in my mouth, the veggies firm and crunchy to the bite and the mushrooms flavor came through on their own.  The ginger was sharp as it should be but not overpowering. This was probably the best meal I had all weekend.  Friend 2 had BBQ baby back ribs that were flavored all the way to the bone, so good and tender and moist. Those were 2nd best  Friend 3 had Volcano Shrimp that were battered in light tempura and were large and succulent. The spicy chili aioli was not too sweet and not too spicy- perfect little app. Lastly the buffalo wings were a disappointment- the wings themselves were dry and over cooked and were cold when they arrived.  I give 4 stars because the sever was just ok- we had to call him to replenish and wings were meh.  Otherwise it was a lovely easy late night hang out spot.",

The appetizers are also first class. Most restaurants do not have main courses that are as good as these appetizers. We last had the ahi tuna and the ruben egg rolls, both were simply amazing.   This is also the only place I order a salad for my main course because their seafood salad is the best thing out there. No other salad compares in both beauty and taste.

I ordered a side of avocado with my huevos rancheros, and when they arrived, I was so hungry I didn't notice they were missing. However, our server did! She hurried off to get it, and halved the price of the avocado add-on, which she really didn't have to do. She was attentive and friendly throughout our whole meal, and generous with the coffee and water refills. I ate everything on my plate! Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for the awesome find. :)",

A quick 5 minute wait then seated promptly, and water and coffee served up within minutes. This place is huge inside. I ordered a basic eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and toast. They use delicious applewood smoked bacon so that's a huge plus in my book. My nephew got a side of sausage and biscuits and a side of bacon.  Only issue was service was a bit slow after we ordered. We needed coffee bad to chase away the effects of last nights vodka, and refills were a bit slow in coming. Overall this was a pretty good place to eat, not as fancy as other dining options in the Venetian. Better than most cafe's at casinos.",

Still, I'm not taking anything away from the quality of their food.  Just like CF, the food is high quality but like CF there's little regard for healthfulness of the preparation so I'm sure everyone of our dishes were close to 2,000 calories.

We all ordered different things from sandwiches, salads, etc. I was honestly too tired to pay attention but it all came out looking delicious and huge. I got the lemon chicken piccatta. Fantastic with mushroom and artichoke hearts on top of a thinly pounded and battered chicken, all on a huge portion of Angel hair pasta. My other friend got the pastrami sandwich and my other friend got the warm chicken salad.  I didn't catch the name or take pics of the other end of the table but everyone was extremely happy with their choices. My only bummer was that they said they couldn't make an espresso martini, yet they serve espresso, vodka, Kailua. Hmmm? Inexperienced bartender? So I just ordered my vodka on the rocks and an espresso and mixed my own drink sans the simple syrup and Kailua  (save the calories for dinner, right?)It was delicious...good espresso. Lots of choices, good prices, good flavor. Very similar to the Cheesecake factory...same restaurant family I think. Great place in the Venetian!",

We were immediately seated and brought water and then left for dead. I joke...kinda...but I think they thought that's all we came for. That had to be it. Eventually our server Whitney) came by, it was a Monday night with a steady crowd, by no means packed, but she moved with a sense of urgency.   The onion soup was probably the show stopping dish...think French onion, without the bread/cheese goop and crank up the flavor. The buffalo chicken rolls were stellar too. Then the ahi tuna ceviche, they tried, there's just nothing to brag about. They played it pretty safe. Those Asian nachos though; let's take a second, it's a peanut butter tasting bbq sauce based rice cake with chicken on it...thingy. Ugh! I'm sorry but I can't for the life of me imagine anyone enjoying that.   Like the real party girls that we are we finished off with Earl Grey tea before taking the city by storm.",

The only reason I am saying that is because I can't seem to find the one in the Palazzo. The food, drinks, and service was AMAZING!!!! The breakfast buffet was so delicious and fresh! Coffee was great! The omelette station was friendly and made great omelettes. The fruit was fresh and tasted sweet. The waffles, bacon, and short rib hash browns were the bomb! Deborah was our waitress and she was super friendly, funny and attentive! We came back for lunch and ordered the chicken pot pie, eggplant fritters, and poke tacos. All I can say is WOW!!! Presentation was amazing, tasted wonderful, and that pot pie was so good! The bartender made perfect Bloody Mary's! Jose was our server. He was very friendly, attentive, gave great recommendations, and also was fun! We loved the food so much that we asked the chef to come out so we could thank him! His name was Christopher. He was also very friendly and his team executed the menu's food perfectly! The manager Mardy came over to see how we were and we told her all about it! We actually had a few things in common! She was great conversation. We stayed at the Palazzo with our friends who were there were getting married and Mardy made reservations for our party to come for breakfast the morning before the wedding. They had our table ready on time and Ralina was our server. She did a wonderful job and even brought out something special for the bride and groom! The lattes were off the chain! All and all I know this is long but I had to share. We are going to come back to the Palazzo just so we can enjoy the Grand Luxe Cafe! MUAH!",

Our server had the worst attitude, my food was brought up way later than when everyone else's food came out and when it finally came after everyone else was already done eating they didn't even bring out all my food also my soon to be mother in law told the server that her glass was dirty and the server picked it up and was examining it as if she was lying. We complained to the server and she said it came out late because it was ordered later then everyone else. Yes it was but only by a few mins !!!! We're all a group we should all get our food at the same time. The manager came out and we told her what happened and she didn't even apologize and she said she couldn't comp us the meal in full because it was ordered separately. I gave this place 2 stars because the food I did get tasted pretty good. Probably won't be back. I'll be sticking to the cheesecake factory where I am never disappointed!!! Maybe you should take some lessons from them grand lux !!!",

As far as the entree's I really like the Thai Chicken Pizza which was removed from the menu so I eat the Chicken & Waffles depending on the night i order it, it's either really bland or over seansoned. The fish basket is also another good choice.",

    "text": "This review is for the Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo Hotel's banquet services.  We had lunch at the restaurant last Spring while scoping out venues for our intimate wedding.  We noticed right away that they had a private dining room that had a podium and audio visual capabilities.  We decided in June to have an August wedding, and decided on the Grand Lux after discovering that their banquet prices were the most reasonable out of all the Las Vegas Strip options.  Yes, it's an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  I happen to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  I sent an inquiry email to the restaurant and received a phone response less than two hours later from Rich, the Events Manager.  He promptly emailed me a list of dinner options along with prices.  Even with the \"plus plus'-es (tip, gratuity, etc.), the per person costs did not break the bank!  Rich also provided his favorite meal options as well as the ones that his customers enjoyed the most.  For the record, we settled on the Filet Mignon ($10 extra), Miso Salmon, Madera Chicken, and Pasta Fresca (for the vegetarians).  We met with Rich and his banquet staff two days prior to our reception, where we handed off our wedding favors and gave instructions.  Rich had our printed menus with meal selections and it looked fabulous.  We decided against bringing our own centerpieces since it was a destination wedding, so they agreed to put flameless votives on the tables.  We were already impressed with their hospitality and our event hadn't even happened yet.  Onward to our wedding day...the room was beautifully set up and Josh and Karen took over all responsibilities.  They showed us how to work the sound system and attended to all our needs.  Our guests complimented on the menu selections -- the filet mignon seemed to be the favorite.  I'm not sure I can adequately describe how the Grand Lux Cafe went above and beyond the call to make our wedding reception everything we wanted it to be.  You will not find another place on the Strip that will treat you like royalty without running you into wedding debt!  If I could give them more than five stars, I would.  I highly, highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe  at the Palazzo Hotel if you are looking for a private intimate (less than 80) wedding reception.  Call Rich and book your wedding reception there today!",

First of it was busy, right after the MMA Awards. I was surprised we were seated so promptly! Excellent customer service.  Our waitress had a strong accent and was a little older with short golden brown hair, she was absolutely a doll!! Had a Monte Christo sandwich with fries and 2 spicy Bloody Mary's. I basically just swallowed my sandwich whole and scarfed down my fries!  Loved the Bloody Mary's. Everyone (all 6 people ) loved their food!

My girls and I have this routine where we wake up late, eat around 2 pm, get ready at 6 pm to go out....actually go out....then finish clubbing at around 3 am and by then...we're STARVING! So this place is so awesome that it is open all the time!   The food isn't gross either. The portions are large and the prices are just right! They even give you bread while you are waiting for your food. I got the Modern Cuban Sandwich. Fresh fries and the sandwich was so good with the sweet meat and a hint of sourness due to the pickle and mustard. Really good! I couldn't even finish it and ended up saving it for the next day.   Everything on the menu sounds good here. It was such a struggle for me to settle with the Modern Cuban Sandwich. My gf's breakfast  sandwich looked amazing! The egg looked so fluffy and vibrant next to the bacon, cheese, slabbed between two slices of bread. GAH.   This place reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory! Their cake options looked so tempting...but we were already feasting late at night...we decided to have portion control.   Need to come back here to try their dinner menu!  Asian Nachos? Chicken & Waffles? All the food looks so good!   Best all day everything. Good looking breakfast, lunch, and dinner, late night!",

    "text": "Best described as \"A High End Cheesecake Factory\".  I heard that it is run by the same company that owns cheesecake factory so it makes sense.  Stopped in here for Breakfast with some friends before G2E at the sands convention center.  It was packed but we only had a 10 minute wait.  The atmosphere is luxury meets comfort.  The breakfast menu has just about everything you could ask for, and I was in the mode for some french toast.  I Got the banana brioche french toast and my mind was blown.  Not only was practically just a loaf of bread cut in half and turned into french toast, but it was really freaking good.  I washed it down with a mimosa that was good, but I was hoping it would be a little more than 3 ounces since it was $7.",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday around 4pm with three friends after a long drive up to Vegas from LA. We were seated as soon as we walked through the door, and waters, and bread quickly came our way, which were much appreciated since we were famished.   After a quick peek at the appetizer section of the menu we placed an order for some Buffalo Chicken Rolls, and by the time those suckers arrived we were able to decide what we wanted for our main course. I opted for the Lunch Special Pasta and Salad with the Pasta Telephono. But more on that later. The Buffalo Chicken Rolls (which came with 6 pieces) were crispy on the outside, and warm, gooey, cheesy, and buffalo-y on the inside. Plus they weren't too filling. So we had plenty of room for our entrees.   Just as we polished off our appetizer, our lunch entrees arrived. And they were HUGE. The side salad was pretty standard. But the pasta was cheesy (notice a theme here?), well-cooked, and tasty. It was basically an adult mac n cheese. And it was so gigantic that I had enough leftover for a late night snack.   And, best of all, the bill came to under $20 per person. It was so very reasonable, especially in Vegas where everything is overpriced. I suggest checking this place out: it'll give you the most grub for your buck (except for maybe a buffet).",

Our server took 30m to take our order and he only had another table to serve. Attitude at this restaurant is something else. We asked to place order and other servers refused to take our order or communicate with our server for us.  It took another 30m for our food to come out, and the food was not that impressive. Nobody brought us ketchup or refill our drinks. When we ask the servers to do so, they didn't want to do that and told us we had to speak to our main server (who was nowhere to be found). At the end, we finished our meal without condiment or water.  I felt like I could have been better off eating at McDonald. At least, they will give you ketchup there.",

    "text": "Ate here 3 times in one weekend -____-  Generally for Grand Lux, we head towards to location closer to Palazzo, but the two is exactly the same.  Since we stayed at the Venetian this time around, instead of venturing out into the hot Vegas summer, we stayed on the Venetian property for the majority of the time and Grand Lux is a favorite among my friends, which also meant we ate a lot of Grand Lux.  There is a food court, but we weren't really feeling it.    Grand Lux is good, especially for large groups because it is a huge restaurant and they can easily accommodate bigger groups.  The menu is also very diverse, from breakfast to Asian-inspired dishes.  It's owned by Cheesecake Factory, so I always thought of Grand Lux as a very expensive diner.  Went for the Chicken & Waffles, Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich, and a Lunch combo for my visits this time around.  The Chicken & Waffles is a favorite of mine.  Belgian waffle that's topped with fried chicken strips and comes with this great brown butter maple.  The grilled cheese sandwich was the first time, and while good, it was just a bit too greasy for me.  Lunch combo with salad, soup, and sandwich is a solid choice for a little variety.  Grand Lux always have good soups at all times, and this time, got to try the Chicken Mushroom Cream, as well as the Chicken Tortilla.  The Chicken Tortilla seriously tastes like liquidfied nachos!  It's pretty damn delicious haha.  Also tried my friend's jambalaya.  Not even close to being the real thing, but not gonna lie, it is pretty damn tasty.  It's more like a stir-fried dish with cajun spices & seasoning!  The place is open 24/7, which is another reason why we came here so many times in one weekend.  After a night out, Grand Lux.  Dinner?  Grand Lux.  Another night out, sure why not Grand Lux again.    Need to convince the others to eat something else next time.",

My friend ordered a paste dish which she enjoyed but it was very rich. I had the Asian nachos. They were unique and quite good.  Service was good. She wasn't the most astute server but adequate and friendly enough.  This is a great place for good food and when you with a big group with a lot of different preferences or don't know what you want to eat. Lots of great choices.",

Surprisingly its not expensive, $10 can get you a fat portion of food that can last you 2 meals if you wanted to. Its similar to the Cheesecake Factory but its in veeeeeegass and its open late nights for all the hungry drunkies! There's so much on the menu we didn't know where to start. Last year I had the cobb salad (wonderful fat salad) this year I went for the buffalo chicken sandwich. It was okay, wasn't spicy enough. My bf had jimbalaya and it was hella good. My friend really enjoyed his pastrami sandwich, finished all of it before we did.   As for dranks, I had the patron paloma. It was so good I could barely taste the alcohol. My sandwich+drink was probably $25, pretty pricey for a meal but I had leftovers of sandwich and fries for later (which were never touched and left at Cosmo hotel room garbage). Hehe.  Service was excellent, our waitress was funny, we tipped her well.",

I ordered the Eggs, any style, Hash Brown Potatoes with Toast and chicken mango sausages. The eggs were cooked the way I requested and you could actually taste he mango in the sausages. I enjoyed every part of this dish. Though to be fair, it's a pretty straightforward dish to make. My girlfriend ordered the \"The Best\" Eggs Benedict with Ham & Hollandaise. It was good but not \"the best.\" The eggs were cooked pretty well (the yolk was runny as they should be but it was a little undercooked since the egg white was a bit soft and runny as well). The ham was very tasty. The hollandaise sauce, however, was too salty. The English muffin was also burnt (too black and hard to cut) and not too pleasant after it soaked up all the hollandaise sauce. The hashbrowns on both dishes were excellent.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience though I'd recommend others to avoid \"the best\" eggs benedict.",

We were there between breakfast and lunch (11-ish) so got to seriously consider both. We ate breakfast. A few breakfast items were no longer available because that grill area had already been turned around for lunch preparation. No worries.. there were many great options to consider.  A couple of omelets, a waffle, and a smoked salmon platter later... our appetites had been sated (that's the past participle of 'satisfied' if anyone was wondering).  Prices are reasonable.

Let me say the portions are very generous, I can eat a lot when I'm hungry and this place always gave me enough for at least 1 1/2 meals.  I had the fish and chips, the caramel chicken, and one of the pastas, and they were all really good.  I ate there with my co-workers, and we were all real happy with the place.  The main thing I want to compliment the Grand Lux about is one of their servers, his name is Jon Fortich (correct spelling, I hope).  I was so tired on the last day of my convention I forgot to take my credit card back after I paid my bill.  I was freaking out, but when I called the restaurant they told me Jon had turned it in to the manager, and he had it locked in their safe and I could pick it up the next day.  I was so relieved!  In short, excellent food, big portion, and great service.  That's why this is my go to place to eat whenever I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "What a way to start the day! Grand Lux looks and feels like a Cheesecake Factory inside a casino resort. Definitely not somewhere the average person could dine out on the regular, unless you are burning an exorbitant amount of calories every day.  Yes there are healthy options but when in Rome...  I enjoyed a breakfast sandwich served on a buttery croissant. Whether they make the pastries in house or not, it was glorious bread!   Also part of the order included a yogurt bowl and short stack of pancakes. Not a typical Wednesday ordeal but tasty nonetheless.",

    "text": "Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Las Vegas  and prides itself on being \"a culinary world tour\" with an American spin on things. Stoppng by the cafe is somewhat of a tradition and its is an absolute MUST whenever I'm in town with  a party full of picky eaters.   The  menu is pretty big and contains everything from craft cocktails, appetizers, tapas-sized dishes, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, salads, and the list goes on. The portions are huge and i'm happy to say that  i've never left this place unsatisfied with quality or taste.   As an added bonus, there is brunch offered every weekend and the cocktails are sure to please. The Strawberry Bellini, Mimosa, Sparkling Rose, and/or Spicy Mary will quench the biggest thirst and leave you with warm fuzzy feelings.  5 stars for the establishment and those who work here. Thank you for always putting customers first and never hesitating to make tweeks and changes to my dishes whenever i stop by. Keep up the great work- hopefully i'll be seeing you a lot sooner than later =)",

You will see a lot of interesting people walk by so I would recommend sitting there.   The menu is really big. There is something for everyone. It's mainly American food with burgers sandwiches salad and pasta dishes. Trust me, you'll find something delicious and to your liking.   We ordered the potato egg rolls. And omg this dish is amazing. If you love mashed potatoes you're going to love this dish. It's basically an egg roll with mashed potato filling in the inside. It's crunchy on the outside and they put cheese, bacon and green onion on it. Also a side of sour cream for dipping. OMG I dream of these egg rolls. Mmmmm. We also got the Asian nachos. Wow these were amazing too. Basically huge wonton chips seasoned with Asian stuff and a huge portion of rice in the middle to put on top of the chips. These two dishes were more than enough for me and my one friend.   The service was great. Our waitress was attentive and sweet. I loved her. Great girl. There's so many places to eat in vegas. This was a great choice. Still dreaming about those potato egg rolls.... :)",

The appetizers are great and perfect for sharing. Just be careful that one appetizer is good for 3-4 people if you're also ordering entrees. The Asian Nachos are to die! Omg I am such a fatso but I really love them.  Upon this trip, I ordered a HUGE salad and I devoured every bite. The chicken avocado salad sounds basic but it was awesome. I didn't love the dressing so word to the wise, get it on the side. This salad goes best with ranch, je pense. They have entrees but they also have reasonably priced sandwiches and burgers (especially in Vegas hotels where everything is super expensive).   The waitress, Petra, was very professional. She said the portions were large and good for sharing, which helped us order appropriately.  Whenever I am at the Venetian, I strongly look forward to coming to Grand Luxe Cafe mostly for the Asian Nachos.",

These restaurants in The Venetian Hotel are pretty hard to find. The signs are not very helpful at telling you the floor or where the correct direction is to the restaurant. One good thing is that self parking is free at The Venetian. We were so hungry and luckily we saw this place was open 24hours. The restaurant is dimmed and is pretty big. Their menu has good options and their prices are really reasonably for Vegas. They have the best fresh warm  sourdough bread and with the butter makes it even more delicious. The food was really tasty and they give good portions. I had the double stacked chicken quesadillas which came with salsa and sour cream. My husband had the shrimp scampi. My son had the Caesar salad. The waiter we had could have been a bit more friendlier and sociable but I guess it was pretty late so he could have been tired. He had an accent and he spoke so softly so it was hard to understand him. He didn't ask everyone what they wanted to drink. He rarely came by to check on us for refills or to ask how our food was. Overall, the food and atmosphere was a great experience but service could have been a little better.",

SO. FRICKIN. GOOD. and the salad that had a delish roasted tomato-caramelized onion vinaigrette. it's too bad i just couldn't finish all this yummy food. they definitely don't skimp on the quality of the food!  fellow, veg buds, this is a great place to load up on great food. another note: the fresh mozzarella pizza is fantastic. it's got roasted tomatoes, spinach, artichokes, and garlic. and my dad loves their spaghetti with clams -- a great portion for 17 bucks. oh great...now i'm getting reeeeally hungry for some grand lux.",

You get the feeling of dining in a nice place for a little cheaper than other restaurants located in big hotels/casinos.  I also like the variety on the menu.  Maybe I'm on the short bus but is this place sister companies with Cheesecake Factory?  They have similar decor, similar menu items, etc.  I ordered the Spaghettini with Clams.  It was yumm.  A little bit spicy for me because there was red pepper flakes which I didn't expect but it was still good and loaded with clams.  My husband had the Fried Chicken.  It was really good and a huge portion with a mound of mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, glazed carrots, and steamed brocolli on the side.  The Creole dippng sauce that came with it was the best part.  The service was really great, quick, and friendly.  I love that this place serves a pretty big variety of food on their late night menu (12-6am) too, so when you get out of the club, you don't necessarily have to eat greasy crap at 4am.",

I like the made-to-order omelets at the buffet, all the fruit, eggs. bacon, breads, hash browns - a really great small buffet.  I have also ordered from the menu (French toast) and it was good, too.

You can also trust that there will be something on the menu that you're craving for or just something that will hit the spot unless you're craving for something specific like sushi or pho or something of that sort.  All of the times I've eaten here was after 2 am and you can bet that there will be a line forming any time between then and later until 4 or 5 am (on the weekend).   The quality of the food and service is worth mentioning.  The wait staff always are friendly and are very knowledgeable of what's on the menu.  One time a friend asked for no bacon in her salad and when the order came she noticed that there was some in it.  The waiter was apologetic and called his manager over and she offered the meal on the house.  It wasn't necessary to do all that since the restaurant was somewhat packed and were willing to let it go, but they were willing to fix the problem.  Some of the things I recommend are the flautas (appetizer) and the pastas are usually good.  From what I remember the prices are mid range/moderate.",

The salad dressing just a little too sweet, the salmon just a little too smoked up, etc. It still taste great going down, just lacking diversity.",

Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($10.50 USD) Slow roasted short rib, caramelized onions, and arugula sandwiched in melted cheese on grilled country bread. Served with a Mixed Green Salad. The sandwich was really good. It was quite greasy though given it was a grilled cheese sandwich, but the slow roasted short rib meat was really tender and the caramelized onions really complemented the meat bringing out a sweetness to the sandwich.  Salisbury Steak ($15.95 USD) Chopped Sirloin Combined with Onions, Mushrooms and Garlic. Served with Mashed Potatoes, Brown Gravy and Fresh Vegetables. The texture of this steak tasted more like a burger, or even softer - you actually don't need a knife to cut the meat, a fork is good enough. Figures since the steak is made from blend ground beef. It was flavorful and tasty.  Food was decent but nothing special imo.",

Now let's get serious, crab and asparagus omelette was okay, crab was flavorful \"topped with hollandaise sauce\" well thats technically True although it's a spoonful on the center.  Chicken and waffles, the chicken was delicious but the waffle batter tasted strange so we ignored the waffle.  I ordered turkey sausage and was informed they only have turkey sausage with mango, I hate mango but ordered it.  The sausage was not bad just a hint of sweetness. Beignets obviously the highlight of the meal! I should have stuck to that.  Huevos Rancheros, the only positive I will say is I liked the crispy fried tortilla and the eggs were good.  The ranchero sauce it is served with in the bottom of the dish just makes it soggy and awkward not a fan! Service was okay, with three entrees just wasn't over the moon for any of them.  So round 2 at Grand Lux, first of all the service was very good friendly and efficient (the reason for my three stars.  On vacation after another long night I wanted to order something I don't order at home.  Biscuits and Gravy, so their version came on top of seasoned potatoes so win win! Okay the plate arrived with meatball sized biscuits that looked as though they had been coated with a pastry brush with gravy then dry on the inside.  Honestly CSI Las Vegas could barely find Gravy if I brought it to their lab.  The egg was good and there was a thin layer of Gravy on the bottom under the potatoes which all it accomplished was to make them soggy.  I didn't say anything because at this point I was done, tag me out done!",

It was near midnight, but it was pretty packed when we got here. Our server was friendly and took care of us well even though she disappeared from time to time.  CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS- minced sauteed chicken breast and vegetables in an asian sauce served with cool lettuce wraps This dish didn't taste that flavorful to me. The sauteed chicken breast had a weird flavor. It didn't taste asian at all. The chicken was dry and all the flavor combos didn't complement each other. It was so strange and not even in a complex interesting way.  GRAND FRIED CALAMARI- with fried rock shrimp, zucchini and onions served with dipping sauces The batter on the calamari wasn't even crispy. The calamari was soggy and chewy. The dipping sauces were nothing spectacular. They just added some much needed saltiness to the dish.   Like the one star says, \"eek! Methinks not.\" I'll pass. I guess I'll stick to eating casino chips because I have yet to find a really good restaurant on the strip.",

I got a lentil soup because I didn't want to gorge during the late night hours. The soup was like $7 and I tried the calamari which was good! That was about $17. The atmosphere is kind of dark/dim couldn't really see the colors of my food but it was alright lmao the food was still good!",

However, we were a young group getting ready to go out on the town and this restaurant was not really appropriate for that.  It kind of killed the mood.  It was more of a family place than a trendy exciting restaurant.  (For example: we ate at Lavo restaurant the night before and that was definitely more appropriate for our group, they had a DJ playing music, everyone was dressed to impress, they had lounge-like seating areas, etc).    The food was pretty good.  I had a chicken salad with lots of other things in it (I can't remember the name of the salad) but I really did enjoy it.  My husband had the short rib and he also enjoyed it.  I definitely do NOT recommend the onion soup, it was SOOOOO over salty and concentrated and had no cheese like a french onion soup, and this is coming from a person who LOVES SALT.    I read some reviews about good breakfasts:  I would say that this place is probably GREAT and COMPLETELY appropriate for breakfast.  Not as much for dinner in my opinion.",

    "text": "Most people know that the one chain restaurant  I am typical fan of is the Cheesecake Factory. Little did we know that this restaurant (and it's sister at the Palazzo, is in the same family as CF). We ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons. Our first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. We had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the CF, the menu is mostly different. The bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. Great crust-and great butter. I ordred the four cheese pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked \"well done\".The husband ordered the chicken pot pie. When our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a GIANT bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served Roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then I like. A few bites in, Kevin and I switched dishes. He loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. The pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts I have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. I had a crust and chicken dinner. We were too full for dessert.  The second time we came here was for dessert after the Jersey Boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the Palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the Grand Lux for dinner(at the P)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren't offered here. We did manage to order the strawberry shortcake (yummy) the key lime pie (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. The wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn't too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.  Our third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. They were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the Venetian. We came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  I had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular CF) and it was much better here than what I have had at any CF with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. Kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza and salad and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. I had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. My friends' had a Cuban and a Carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered.   Of course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, I had my fill.  This place is open 24 hours, with a late night menu, a breakfast menu a lunch time menu and the regular menu. If this was a place close to me, I would be a regular and not have shame since it was good.",

The manager Ms. Lorena Rojas came by and refused to move us and said she didn't have any tables even though there were many next to us. She said that she would need to ask us to go back in line. She also told us if she found that the kid moves around she would need to ask us to leave the place. Which toddler sits in one place the whole time?? I told her we had already waited quite a bit and that my son was already hungry. She looked like she couldn't care less.In any case, she said the reason was that she couldn't service any other place but we noticed that there were tables being served all the way at the back. There was clearly some kind of profiling going on. I am aghast at this happening in Grand Lux and in this day and age. Unbelievable - Grand lux - it's time you vetted your staff properly.

Try the Rustic Lasagna and the Cajon Shrimp and Chicken if you want something hearty or the Grand Cobb Salad for a lighter fare.  The service at Grand Luxe simply can't be beat. Every time I've visited, our waitresses or waiters have always been superb -- helpful, patient, cordial and friendly. I love it.

Also one of the asparagus end you snap off made it into my omelette - yuck.  Service slow and it wasn't very crowded.  We will eat somewhere else tomorrow",

I guess I just had a better expectation with seeing how nice the restaurant itself looks and how big the menu was. Our waitress was nice, but she took forrrrrever! We were there for almost 2 hours... I know part of it was because one of our party was late, but still... we could have gotten our appetizer while we waited.  I hope they wipe their table really good! I hated how the silverwares were just sitting on the table, not wrapped up in a napkin and not on top of a napkin, and not covered, they were just setting directly ON the table... then the waitress just puts the menu right on top of our plate and silverware, I'm not really a health/germ freak, but how many people's dirty hands have been on those menus? and now those germs are all over my silverware and plate that I'm about to eat with!   Food was OK... The bread was pretty good. My husband got a chicken caesar salad and the chicken has some fishy taste to it, and half of the lettuce was soggy. I didn't really like it. We had a Chicken Quesadilla and although it was good and tasty, it was really greasy. One thing I cant complain about was their desert... Creme Brule... it was pretty good! You definitely have to have a sweet teeth for this though.",

    "text": "You see that \"R\" by my name? I'm a regular here and I don't even live in Vegas. That's how much I've been here. Oh, do I miss the 7am breakfast after a long night... and I just got back from Vegas a few days ago. This was the closer of the night/morning. After a grueling night with the City of Sin, we, along with many others, find ourselves here at the Grand Lux Cafe. I think I've been here 4 times in 3 days.   The food is surprisingly very good! I ordered the pizza lunch special on my first visit and loved it. It didn't get me stuffed but I was full and content. Better than eating a buffet, where I always over eat and feel like crap come dinner time. Came back the next morning... or some would call it... a few hours later and had the \"healthy breakfast\" which consisted of chicken breast, egg whites and some veggies. I did not expect it to be good, and it wasn't but it wasn't bad either... it was healthy (understandable).   Had a legit breakfast here (like actually waking up in the morning and coming here). The breakfast buffet was excellent! The selection was very limited but the items that they have were all great. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, not burnt but not undercooked. The omelets were great too.   Lastly, had one last breakfast, this time it wasn't legit (due to the fact that there was no sleep prior to this breakfast) Don't know what I ordered, could be my lack of memory, or we can just blame it on the night.   Now to the service. It was excellent every time we were there (and I remembered). I must say though, our waitress for breakfast was absolutely wonderful. Definition of great customer service! If i knew her name I'd let you guys know... but the entire staff at the Grand Lux is amazing. Great service!",

The double stuffed mashed potato spring rolls are my go to dish and I don't think I could ever get enough!  It also soaks up the alcohol so less of a hangover the next day, and lets face it in vegas the sooner the hangover is relieved the sooner the next party begins!  (or you could just drink through the hangover...but that's usually for vacation, and its tough being a local!)  One star deducted cause the wait staff isn't quite the friendliest, but then again i guess i probably wouldn't be all smiles if i was dealing with drunken vacationers all night long.  Despite that it is still always worth a trip after a night at TAO nightclub!",

    "text": "The Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian is amazing!!! The vibe of the place is really inviting and artistic. The service was really good and friendly. The sour dough bread with vinegar and olive oil is a great appetizer to start off with and it's free. This place is owned by Cheesecake Factory, but it's a step up in quality and price.   Positives:  The appetizers are just as good as an entree lol . We had some shrimp and fried calamari. The fried calamari came in a huge portion and it really filled us up. We didn't even finish it.   The entree that I had was Fish and Chips. I know that you can never go wrong with Fish and Chips, and I was right about the quality of it. It was 4 nice big pieces of Alaskan Cod with fresh hot fries. Their Buffalo Wing Chicken wrap is good too.   Negatives: It did take quite a bit of time for our food to come, but they did come at one time. My brother's filet mignon was kinda well done rather than medium like he wanted, but they did offer to take it back and re-do it but we were in a hurry. The price is what it is in terms of a fancy restaurant, but hey, it's Vegas and you want to eat like kings.   Aside from the negatives, I still give this place 5 stars for the quality and service. We were never left in the dark in terms of needing service from our waiter. There are only 3 Grand Lux Cafes in the country, so they do have good standards and quality.",

So far I havent had anything bad but then again the menu is very extensive. Pages and Pages of food choices. They are a sister company of Cheesecake Factory so that should give you an idea of the type and quality of food.  Since most times im here for the late night, im going to have to recommend breakfast. You can always eat breakfast anytime of the day but something about having it after a night of drinking with friends.  The corn chowder is great. Its full of corn, not milky and theres bacon it in. Yes, alot of bacon. I did have to add a little pepper to spice it up a bit but it could be just me.  The fresh basil with moz cheese pizza is great. The moz is so fresh and the basil with the oil and the thin crust remind me of CPK but better. Oh did I just say that =)  I would recommend to not go there during peek hours. Even though it large, sometimes there is aline out the door. You could always just leave someone in line and the rest can go out and gamble. Thats what the hotel wants anyway.",

HA  We ordered chicekn wings, sliders, artichoke dip, spring rolls with peanut sauce, my friend ordered the mushroom burger which was vegan. All was super delicious!!

The prices were decent and it's something different from the fast food court. We came to this specific location for lunch one day and we all got different things. I ordered the half salad and pasta de telefono. The salad was a spring mix and was good, and the pasta was very cheesy but since I enjoy cheese it was delicious.

We wanted to fill up on some yummy food and be able to make it home without stopping to eat. Boy, did that plan work!  After looking through the massive menu (you can tell this place is related to the Cheesecake Factory, so many choices), I decided to order the Chicken Parmesan lunch special. Advertised as a lunch sized portion, I figured it would be perfect for me to eat and not have too much left over. I'm still trying to figure out who the portion was meant for...a 300-lb man, perhaps? There was no way this little lady would ever be able to eat this in one sitting! In fact, I brought it home and made two more meals out of it!  That said, the chicken parmesan was wonderful! Unlike others that tend to be dry, this was moist and flavorful. The pasta needed a bit more sauce for my liking (I like it dripping in it), but the waitress happily brought me a side of marinara. Priced at $13 or $14 (I can't remember), it was a great deal!  Be prepared to wait awhile for your food but at least they offer complimentary bread and butter to snack on.",

The omelet was full of vegetables and overall I would recommend.",

I remember a very select few things about this place...those things being:  -huge and varied menu...like The Cheesecake Factory -I think the portions were big. -I think I got a burger, I think I liked it. -My husband tells me he got the short rib grilled cheese...and he also thinks he liked his. -The server was very nice...and very patient with a very drunk group of 8 people -We had 2 birthdays in our party so they brought out some cute birthday thing with a candle... couldn't tell ya what the candle was stuck in...but there was a flame, that I remember!

The service was good, though not spectacular. I would definitely recommend that if you get a salad, ask for the house dressing. It's a vinaigrette that is as tasty & interesting as the Strip is spakly & bright! My companions had the Asian Chicken salad, and both gave that two enthusiastic thumbs up!",

I see you, Lux. I see you!  4th star came when I bit into that scrumptious breakfast sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had ordered two of them or something. But don't me wrong, I still devoured that sucker, it just took me a little longer. Only thing is that I wish they put a tiny bit more effort into their hash browns. Mine were kinda bland and barely crispy. Another off note: we ordered ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if they packed the ranch (they said they did), but when we got back to our room, no ranch to be seen. Bummer cause ranch is my boo boo. Not cool, but it happens.  Something to note- I'm not sure of its connection to The Cheesecake Factory: It used to be one? It's owned by the same company? Not sure but it definitely had the same vibe and I love me some CF so I ain't mad at it!  I would definitely come back!",

It's super savory and creamy. The crust was so buttery and flakey! My boyfriend got their steak and eggs. The steak came out a bit too cooked and bland.

I called 3 days before to make a reservation and was glad they were able to accommodate our big party on such short notice. They have a 15 minute wait policy where you will lose your reservations if you're more than 15 minutes late but are pretty accommodating as long as you call to keep them updated on your ETA.  The restaurant is very cute!  It has a cheesecake factory feel to it (I believe they're sister companies) but a bit more glamorous. The lights are dimmed and the decorations are fancy. It's a fun place to eat for a Bachelorette party or even on a romantic date! It's a very large restaurant so it isn't loud in there even with a restaurant full of people.   The food is also amazing!  The pasta portions are HUGE so it's best to share with another person since there is no way you'll be able to finish it (and yes that is a challenge lol).   The negatives that keep me from giving it 5 stars: our group waited about 45 minutes just for our food which is way too long for sandwiches and pastas. Our waiter sucked because he hardly came to check on us. Our drinks were always empty and we waited so long after we finished to even get our receipt. Hopefully we just got a bad server and you end up having better luck! Otherwise, this place was amazing!",

This has a big inkling resemblance to the Cheesecake Factory and that's only the case because it is a spin off of the Cheesecake Factory -- go figure!   Their menu is HUGE. It would take me a good 5 minutes to read everything and decide what I want but the first time we came here, we ordered from their take out area, and the second time I came here, we just ordered desserts. Their cheesecakes do not hold a candle to the ones at the Cheesecake Factory but it was still okay at the time. I was more interested in the complimentary white and wheat breads to cure my hangover and fill my empty belly.   The lady at the table next to use ordered Grand Lux's pot pie and the pot pie was bigger than her head. It was MASSIVE! I laughed when she tried to eat it.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely paying a visit to the Grand Lux Cafe. And did you know there's one over in the Palazzo too? Because I sure didn't. We trekked over from the Palazzo to eat at the one in the Venetian -- hahaha . . .",

Granted the last time I went I was bombed and don't even remember what or how I ordered. I got some sort of burger with Thousand Island on some sort of bread that resembled 10 grit sandpaper. I have scars in my mouth to prove it.   There are two redeeming qualities for this location only: 1) It is in Vegas, so at least that means I am there and that always puts a smile on my face & B) One trip we were fortunate enough to observe a drunken woman get into an argument with another table from outside the restaurant. Said woman proceeded to grab plates from an empty table and hurl them toward the other party involved in the argument. She was subsequently carried off by security.",

It had been far, far too long since we had eaten, but where could we find good food so late?  Fortunately, we stumbled on the Grand Lux Cafe. Seated immediately, in large cozy booths, and promptly delivered a large boat of a margarita, I couldn't help but sigh in contentment. Have you ever been to one of those places where the cost is just above the price for casual food, and the food has such high aspirations that it ends up falling flat? Well this isn't that place. You pay a little more at the Grand Lux Cafe, but you get a lot more in terms of food, service and atmosphere.   The servings here are gynormous. Yes, gynormous. The fried calamari was delicious, especially with the shrimp mixed in, and honestly would have been filling enough to call it a light meal for two people. The BLT was huge, with heaps of crisp, delicious bacon finding their way straight to my heart (and hips). One person in our group got a deli sandwich and asked how much meat it came with. After asking to leave half of it off, she still could barely fit the sandwich in her mouth. And the fish and chips? Let's just say there would have been enough for about 2 and a half meals.   The service was great as well, friendly, unpretentious and quick. But what impressed me was, despite it being so late, and the Grand Lux clearly having a late night menu, our server told us we could order anything we wanted from the main or late night menu. Great food, huge portions, at random hours of the night, and a wide selection of choices? Five stars, Grand Lux, five stars...",

Other than that you cant really go wrong with anything else.   I tried the pizza, chicken and waffles, pasta, grilled chicken sandwich, shaken beef, calamari, crab cake. and the raw tuna.

He said it was all made \"for them\" and some other language that appeased us at the time, but disappointed us a bit when the food came and the pasta was obviously not fresh.  I know, we were dreaming to think we could get fresh pasta made that day for that price, but we were in Vegas, where my sister eloped and dreams come True, right?  On the upside, the pasta was not over-cooked and limp.  All in all a solid meal and I would go back, especially if I were trying to get decent food at a decent price on the strip.  This is almost as low a price as a place like Nathan's Famous hot dogs, especially if you share a main course, which the portion sizes will definitely let you do, but here you get to sit down and eat a nice meal.  For us especially nice, because my new brother-in-law bought us dinner.   Thanks Paul!",

    "text": "I had the Chicken Fusilli pasta with the sundried tomatoes and it was pretty good! ...Minus the gallon of ORANGE OIL that the noodles were drowning in.  I'm sure that's probably why it tasted so good, but when you are hungry, what isn't good!  I also tried their pepperoni pizza which was NOT tasty at all.  I was buzzed and it was still WAY too greasy and slimy for me.  It didn't even have a crispy crust!  It was so soggy from drowning in orange oil as well.  I just started nibbling on my friend's salad just to try to make myself feel a little healthier.    The food here is pretty similar to the food they serve at Cheesecake factory.  You get pretty big portions for the price you pay and if you play a lot, you can even get your meals comped! If I went to Tao again, I would probably eat here again, just out of convenience.  Still, not too bad and not too expensive for somewhere in Vegas!",

I don't know if you would call this place trendy, but it was certainly nice.  It is in the Venetian Hotel which is a baller-ass spot. The Grand Lux Cafe has a beautiful bar area with a collection of bottles placed on shelves 10 feet up. Anyway, I ordered Chicken Jambalaya. . . SO BOMB. It could have been spicer, but the meal was delicious. The chicken was tender, the veggies were fresh, and the rice was light and fluffy. I ordered the lunch portion which was very satisfying and the price was perfect.   The only thing that turned me off about this place was that it is owned by the Cheesecake Factory. . . I have nothing against the place, but I guess I would have given the Lux a 5-star if it was the only one of it's kind.   Anyway after a long drunken night of Vegas, or if you are just visiting with your family before a show definitely stop by the Grand Lux Cafe. Order a Sangria and enjoy the friendly service, great food, and lax ambiance.",

My wife had the fish of the day, which was a white fish (can't remember which) done picata-style with lemon, mushrooms, and capers.  Both were satisfying and tasty, and well prepared.

    "text": "I am a big fan of grand lux cafe so let me start off by saying that. However my last visit pushed me to write this review. I had ordered a to-go entree salad 20 mins before I knew I would be at the restaurant. When I arrived I went to the bar to pick it up. There were 3 bartenders working, I believe 1 was in training. After I want to say maybe 7 minutes the trainee came over to me I told him I was picking up an order. He then went to the back to pick it up came out maybe 4 minutes later handed me the salad and I proceeded to hand him my debit card. I checked the salad just in case to make sure it was the right one, kale and avocado salad w/chicken, and it was wrong. Mind you this is 30 minutes after I had placed the order. I let him know it was incorrect, he apologized and went back to the kitchen and brought it back out after another 4 minutes. He said it was the right salad just with not enough kale. I told him no, that I have ordered it many times before and it's an all kale salad with absolutely no romaine in it. He said well that's not what the chef told me. I told him trust me I've had it before so I know what I ordered. He took it to the back and I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. I've now been in the restaurant 30 minutes for a SALAD after giving them 20 minutes head start. He came out and said the manager would be bringing it out. Finally he brought it out, apologized for the miscommunication and charged me not even full price but more than what I have ever paid for it in the past because they charged me for the wrong salad! I was so shocked that the manager was taking any kind of payment at all that I just gave it to him. So upsetting because I realized when I opened it yet again when I finally sat down to eat it, that it was still not the right salad. Unbelievable  Please work on how to handle this situation, not the best example for a new trainee. Cannot believe I paid for a salad I ended up not even eating because after all this the chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. Thanks grand lux",

The place is huge and reminded me of the Cheesecake factory with it's many offerings, but on a grander scale and less \"franchisey\" than the Cheesecake factory.   Service was good, just a touch snobby as I felt they frowned upon us bringing a kid in.  Maybe it's just me. The short rib sloppy joe was great (thanks to my yelper friend Len for recommendations) and prices were reasonable.  I expected it to be much higher.

When I finally did get there for breakfast I had the huevos rancheros.  The flavor was OK, but it was extremely watery.  The person who took my order wasn't my waitress and when my actual waitress came by she tried to take my order again.  I saw it happen again at another table which could have meant that one lady was poaching tables or the other was a step behind - tough to tell.

    "text": "Yes, I'm admitting it, I'm a cliche.   I had a date to meet my guy at the Grand Lux. I didn't think I'd need to specify which one, although I did (which he denies). Haha. As you can imagine, the obvious error occurred. I was sitting outside the Grand Lux at Venetian (with no cell service, go figure) and I couldn't locate him. After 30 minutes I was finally able to locate a spot on the casino floor where I could get service. I called my man and tried to describe where I was in relation to him as he said he had been sitting inside the restaurant all this time. This being his first time inside either the Venetian or the Palazzo, was easier said than done. I finally convinced him to head to the other Grand Lux, which is where I thought I was. 10 minutes later, still no sign of him. Seriously? I was getting agitated. I finally got service again and was able to contact him. He described where he was and I was able to ascertain that he was actually at the Grand Lux opposite from me. Ooops, we were both at the same location from the beginning. I'll own it, that was my mistake. How he walked passed me without me noticing him on his way to the other Grand Lux, I'll never understand. As there are two locations at adjoining casinos, I have to hope that I'm not the only one this has happened to, or are we just that dumb?   Finally, we're seated and ready to eat. I've been here a number of times before. Usually for some late night grub. The food isn't spectacular. I had a very regular omelette with no bells or whistles and my guy had a very regular sandwich. The food is standard cafe fair. I like the food ok, it's just nothing amazing. If I'm in the area, I'd probably prefer to go to First Food & Bar for their amazing strip views and fun bar foods, but this is a good alternative as well. There are lots of desserts, so check those out as well.",

Two of my friends and I just wanted something light so we wouldn't spoil our appetite for dinner that night. I ordered a mojito which was made just right. The one that my friend ordered was good too, I can't remember the name of it but it was yellow. We also ordered the mini chili cheese hot dogs and the crispy Thai shrimp and chicken spring rolls. The chili cheese hot dogs were so cute! It was a little salty for me but it was still good. The way you eat the spring rolls is to wrap it inside  a piece of lettuce along with mint leaves, carrots, and their sweet chili sauce. It was pretty good as well.   You can never go wrong with grand luxe cafe for breakfast, a quick snack, or late meal after the clubs.",

So after watching the show Recycled Percussion - which would be my next review.....we hit the casino for a while...and decided to walk to Venetian to try the 24hour Grand Luxe Cafe we heard so much about. And you know what? The garlic- bleu cheese burger and fries were amazing.....even my slow braised short rib grilled cheese sandwich hit the spot.   I have overloaded on bad white carbs yesterday and today but this was one of the times it was more worth it...and I'll do it again! =) service was wonderful and woohoo for 24hr restaurants that are GOOD!  It's far from our hotel but well the walk was worth it =D definitely recommend this place for some late night munchies and dining. =D I just wish had a bigger appetite to try their other dishes...which I heard everything on their menu is pretty good. The bill came out to be around $30 bucks for two and definitely much more satisfying than the places we have tried so far.",

Especially in Vegas when you'll be paying quite a hefty dollar for almost everything.  I've had the all you can eat breakfast buffet, the chicken Parmesan, and the ribeye.  Breakfast Buffet: 4/5 Honestly it's hard to mess breakfast up so this part of the menu doesn't stand out in my mind.  Ribeye: 4/5 Again though price for value, it was a very good steak for the amount you pay. Cooked pretty well to what I asked.  Chicken Parmesan: 5/5 The BEST chicken Parmesan I've had hands down anywhere. When recommending items I always recommend this item to my friends and family and never were their expectations let down. The breading seasoning is just the right amount, with just the right amount of crispness in each bite.  Servings are also quite generous.  Service is not too bad. Positive servers. OK wait time for food and as long as the back area is open, the wait time for seating is not too bad either.",

    "text": "Great food, huge portions at decent prices!  This is the upscale version of Cheesecake Factory, so you will notice that the decor and menu is very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory.  I love the food here and I love that it's open 24 hours!  This restaurant is located on the bottom level of The Venetian.  My friends and I were starving and got here around 1am to a short line.  Their menu consists of a section for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  Dinner lasts until midnight and late night is from midnight to 6am.  Lucky for us, they said they were still serving up dishes from the dinner menu when we got there so we had a wide array of options to choose from.  My friend and I both ordered an \"appetizer salad\".  I got the Greek Salad and added chicken.  My friend got their spicy calamari salad.  When we got our plates we were shocked because it was still a huge portion!  I added chicken to my salad because I didn't think I'd be full off just greens, oh how wrong I was!  Neither of us were able to finish it.    My two other friends split an entree salad called the \"Sheila's Dream\" and it was sooo good!  Seriously, a party in your mouth.  It had an eclectic blend of ingredients and the dressing was top notch, I'm gonna get that the next time I come.  So worth the $12!  Even though everything on the menu here is delish, I'd strongly recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon - best dish on the menu!!  As far as desserts go, their strawberry shortcake dessert here is excellent!  I'm inclined to say it is the best ever - it's fresh strawberries, shortbread, and cream all thrown onto a plate together so it isn't a sliced piece of cake like you'd find at other restaurants.  You just have to try it for yourself.  Drooool...",

    "text": "If I could only give this place 0 stars, I would. Long story short, you better hope you don't get the redhead, Sierra, as your waitress. And the manager on duty was just as terrible, if not worse. Let me tell you why.   Now don't get me wrong, my boyfriend and I have ALWAYS loved dining here in the past. But this time around, I don't know what it was that changed but we certainly left HATING the place.  We came in on a Wednesday night.  My boyfriend and I were seated and we found our initial server to be quite awkward and seemingly uninterested in obtaining our orders. After about 20 minutes of waiting he finally comes around and tells us they were undergoing a shift change and asked if our new server had been around yet. Nope. Nothing yet. But that's fine, should be understandable given the shift change, right? He then takes our orders before he leaves.  So our initial server leaves and we literally waited another 30 minutes before our food came out, and it wasn't until 10 minutes after that some lady decides to finally come and ask how everything is tasting. I'm sorry... but who are you? Oh that's right... you must be our server?   At the table across from me I observe a lady and her husband getting just as irritated with the lack of service from our same waitress and elapsed time waiting on their food.  Fast forward all of the ridiculous waiting and our almost non-existent server, she finally comes around to give us the bill. I had never been so irritated with such service or the lack of in my entire life, and I am usually the patient one between my boyfriend and I (might I add, we also used to be servers too).  Silly me, I decide to take it up to the manager as we are leaving... And he could not be any less disinterested! Sierra comes along to see what's going on (because I'm SURE she knows what crappy service she delivered) and as I begin to complain she just gives me that \"I don't have time for this\" look and is dismissed by her unapologetic manager.   He showed no remorse, whatsoever. All I did was complain about the lack of service and a simple apology would have sufficed. My boyfriend and I have BOTH been servers in the past. I don't care if you're having a bad day, you're just slow as heck, or running behind... You still say SORRY.  Now I don't know if the manager just didn't take me seriously since I didn't wear my \"big girl\" pants and heels that night (maybe he thinks I'm just some child trying to get comped for a meal, who knows??). But as a current nurse and past waitress I would like to see how he would feel if he were my patient/customer complaining about his issues and I just stared at him blankly with no remorse or reaction.  But anyway... vent session, over lol. Hopefully everyone's experience will be MUCH better than ours :)",

They were just putting away the breakfast buffet, so seeing that I decided to order from their all day breakfast menu. My husband is a chef, formerly at a hotel, and warned me that it would probably be the worst time of day to be ordering a breakfast since the cooks are winding down from making breakfast probably since about 5AM. Stupidly, I ignored him and ordered it anyway.  I ordered the eggs anyway meal: two eggs, hash browns, bacon, and sourdough toast. Everything was bland and overcooked. My bacon was burnt and flavorless, the hash browns were dry, and my eggs tasted like rubber, and my toast was cold. I would have complained to my server if I could have found her. Unfortunately after a few minutes my hunger got the best of me and I ate the crap anyhow.  My husband's vegetable soup was not any better. He found several vegetable ends in his small cup, and TWO bay leaves. I'd hate to think how many bay leaves the stock pot had in it if two ended up in his tiny cup.  And as I intimated before, our service was AWFUL. We ordered at 11:40 and didn't receive our food until 12:15. And our server was nowhere to be found in the interim. I think she just waited in the kitchen until her orders were up, delivered them and went straight back to the kitchen to wait again instead of checking up on her tables.  The food and the service were terrible, which is a shame since when we initially arrived I thought to myself that I wanted to get up earlier the next day to get their breakfast buffet. After this experience, I will NEVER go back.",

And add to that the fact that it is inside my favorite hotel, the Venetian, where I constantly state that the food is AMAZING - - Grand Lux is the only establishment in that hotel that pales in comparison.  It's a coffeeshop atmosphere - extremely large with plenty of seating.  In all of my years of going to the Venetian, I've only stood in line twice or so.... usually, there IS seating available.  There is a LOT on the menu, so much that it is difficult to pick.  The basic things - like a bagel with lox and cream cheese - is fine.  But how hard is a bagel and cream cheese? Other things - like the club sandwich or the steak sandwich, or the burgers, are all mediocre.  HUGE, yes, but it is a 12 dollar burger so I expect either big in taste of huge, and Grand Lux gives you huge.  I keep on eating here on every visit in spite of the lack of taste, just because it's so convenient  since I stay at this hotel, and the mood is inviting and nice but I am consistently unimpressed with the food.  It's Vegas.  Impress me.... and I give them all these chances, and still - -  they don't.  Coffee is blaaah - as is the case with the entire hotel, and service is decent.  Nothin' to write home about.  For quick and easy eating - - Grand Lux Cafe is okay.  But your socks won't be knocked off, you won't come out moaning and groaning, you won't wonder when the next time you get to eat here will be, and it's definitely not one of those, \"I CANNOT WAIT TO GET HOME TO YELP ABOUT THIS PLACE\" type of restaurant.  I uploaded some of the food photos I took here. Believe me.  It looks better than it tastes.  :-)",

Brunch buffet options were scrambled eggs, hash browns, pancakes, a fruit plate, pastries, and an omelet station. In short, the exact opposite of what you go to a Vegas buffet for.   For essentially the same price you could have gone to the Wicked Spoon instead - that place was fantastic.  TLDR - compensates for a pathetic buffet by making you feel too sick to eat.",

He had a very professional attitude, kept refills coming and even offered to box our items to-go for us (which we refused) because we can do it ourselves.   Thanks Brian for your wonderful help!!",

From breakfast to sandwiches and a wide variety of entrees. Good size portions and reasonably priced for Vegas standards. Even at the early morning hours service at the bar and tables was friendly and efficient. Tried a couple of the sandwiches and burgers both were very good. Only item I tried here that I wasn't crazy about was the pepperoni pizza. The sauce was too strong and overwhelmed the pepperoni flavor. Even in the early morning people were waiting for tables.",

I ordered the pastrami burger with a garden salad. The salad was fresh and delicious. My burger was cooked just the way I like it,  medium rare, and the bread they give you as appetizers was warm and fresh. Grand Lux is so good that we came back 2 nights later on October 20. I ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich then.  This was one of the best I've tasted and not every place I've had one knows how to make it. There are only two places I recommend for a Monte Cristo and that's Disneyland French Quarters and now the Grand Lux. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out. They're located inside The Palazo hotel. The Grand Lux will be one of those restaurants in Vegas that I will be enjoying for years to come.",

One of my friends ordered the southwest salad, I thought that was delicious! I couldn't stop picking at her plate. Another friend ordered the jambalaya. That was pretty good.

They gave us a basket of bread and butter. Of course I dig right in. This bread was the worst bread I have ever had. Do not get me wrong, the flavor was there but the crust of the bread was so tough! I could barely chew it! It seemed like old bread that has been reheated.   The calamari was a 30 minutes wait but it was good. Not the best I have had but good.  The main entrees took another 30 minute wait. I was a bit agitated at this point but I was happy about how the food looked.    The shrimp scampi was okay.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was yummy!  The sauce on the pasta was way too sour.  I was not a big fan and neither was my boyfriend.   The beef wellington had a side of rainbow carrots, Brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. It had a very good flavor but sadly it was way too salty. I couldn't finish eating the second cut of steak. I never usually complain about the dish but I could not take how salty it was. I was downing so much water because my mouth was getting dry. I was highly disappointed with my meal.  I give one star for the kind waitress. The wait and food quality was not her fault whatsoever.  I give a second star because the sides on the beef wellington was really good! They were all cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were to die for.  And the shrimp on the pasta was also delicious.    I'll give another try one day but hopefully they improve the food quality.",

    "text": "Grand Lux is always a great place to go when you can't think of what you wanna have. They have a little of everything! I almost always get the pasta with chicken and sun dried tomato. Awesome pasta. The other dish I usually get is the shrimp scampi. It tastes much better than the version at Cheesecake Factory--shrimp is bigger, and crispier too. The combo dishes of caramel chicken and shaking beef are good too, but in those combo dishes, the shaking beef has VERY VERY FEW pieces of actual beef. Its a tiny bit of beef and a crapload of sliced green onions. Oh, and for the appetizers, try the chicken lettuce wraps. Very good, but they make it look like the dish is full of chicken...its not. Its mostly those white fried crispy noodles. But for dessert, ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS, save room for the Beignets. Holy smokin frijoles they are awesome. The three sauces are great too...the Beignets are the perfect comfort food....they can grow back a limb! But BEWARE---the Grand Lux in the Venetian DOES NOT serve beignets, only the grand Lux in the Palazzo!!!",

The atmosphere is great and there are about a million options to choose from on the menu. I tend to think the larger the menu, the lower the consistency and quality of food. I proved my self wrong here.   The strawberry lemonade was very refreshing, but it is also VERY sweet. I then moved on to the duck pot stickers and finished with the seafood salad. The portions are huge and the price is good. If you want an reasonably priced alternative and don't want to leave the Palazzo then this is a good bet!",

The burger was HUGE though, so much so that I really couldn't figure out a good way to eat it with company around.  I would not recommend that you order the burger if you are on a business meeting!",

I drove the herd here on a weekday morning for breakfast.  Just beat the morning rush hour....10am-ish.   Started with a \"Paul Bunyan\" sized Latte.  Very good.  Then I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs.  HANDS DOWN, the best CB Hash i've ever had.  Sure its pricey, but its rare to see REAL chunks of shredded corn beef.  Not minced and ground like mush, but chopped strips of beef.  Damn....it was that good.  Throw in a couple of fresh eggs over easy, and wheat toast with preserves.  Definitely in my top 10 breakfasts of all time.  I really liked the decor and seats.  All oversized so it was a big thumbs up for me....especially for those who are 6FT and over.... I was comfy.  Service can be spotty.  Servers can get preoccupied with shop talk, and they get distracted by other customers.  Otherwise, they were quite friendly, but hard to flag down.  Looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner menu someday.  It looked pretty amazing.",

I was told to get the cripsy caramel chicken which is like orange chicken, and it was ok but the portions are HUGE. They didn't tell us how big the portions are. The lemon chicken picatta is really good, and that literally feeds 3 people NO JOKE.  If you can finish it all you are a champ.  Foods decent, and huge portions, and decent prices for vegas.

If you're sitting around your house on a random Thursday night and have a hankering for Cheesecake Factory then fine, go eat there. But if you're in VEGAS for G-ds sake and you want a tasty and fabulous meal, then why would you waste stomach space on this place? Or.. if you're drunk and you want food at 4 am, then go find somewhere really cheap to eat (like Earl of Sandwich! or even McD's) because you are drunk, and won't be able to tell the difference. Maybe I've just eaten at the Cheesecake Factory one too many times to be excited by this repackaged version of the restaurant. I mean, if I was staying in the Venetian and my friends were all, \"hey, let's eat at Grand Lux\" then I would do it. But I would secretly wish that we were somewhere else.",

Then we asked him about the beignets for dessert. Again another disappointing response from the waitress. So we decided to eat there anyway since we were already there. The waitress was telling us how most men don't like mushroomsand she asked if we wanted mushrooms with our meal. we said yes. Our mail came and there were no mushrooms. Instead we were told it wasn't mushrooms that they gave us . It was brussels sprouts instead. Let me see mushrooms or brussels sprouts.  We felt cheated and disappointed.  Not a very good experience and another 2.5 miles back. We should have stayed and ate at the hotel.",

Loved Happy Hour menu with the appetizers and $5 drinks special.  I loved the blueberry mojito.  As well, each appetizers were $5 each.  We ended up ordering Creamy Spinach & Cheese Dip, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls, Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls and Double-Cheese Mini Sliders.   Everything was yummy!  I really enjoyed the Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls.",

    "text": "Like most people have described, it is like the cheesecake factory. I would also give the cheesecake factory 3 stars for these same reasons (to help you gauge my scale here). I place a lot of weight on the food quality and taste at a restaurant (go figure). Unless the server were to throw food on me and break the plate over my head I wouldn't take away more than a star for service. That being said, the service was good, food presentation was attractive, and the place was clean. No points given up there. It's just that the food tasted like chain restaurant food to me. Maybe some folks like that, but when I eat out I want fresh tasting ingredients and quality foods. It is very hard to find that these days though.  If you are out for a meal with huge portions and a good palatable dining experience, then this place will be fine. The price is right too. If you want a place that has ingredients that were never frozen and prefer a more natural and fresh taste, I think you will have to look elsewhere.",

It's an upscale I hop or Denny's with way better food. This is always my to go spot when there's no other places to go. Never a wait, and be prepared to sit for awhile reading their menu unless you're familiar with their menu because it's pages and pages long. Tons of choices to the point it's hard to decide if you're really hungry. My suggestion is maybe ask the server \"what's good\" because of course some items are better than others. I always recommend and suggest this place.",

I usually stay at the Palazzo, but stayed at the Venetian this time, so when I had a very important business related dinner I was careful to book in the Venetian, to save us all some walking.  When we arrived, we were seated in a spot which was towards the front of the restaurant.  It was very frenetic and noisy, and stressful.  I like the Palazzo set up better.  Also, I ordered the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken, as I usually do, and it was not as good as they do it at the Palazzo. :(  It was fine, but not spectacular, as I've had that experience with this dish before.  I look forward to my next meal at Grand Lux, but I will go to the Palazzo location regardless of where I'm staying.",

Now restaurants from celebrity chefs are all over the place and a typical meal at one of these places is going to set you back $40-$50 bucks.  Whats great about the grand lux is that prices are reasonable, most dishes running about $15-$20 dollars, good food and good service.  At my last visit to the restaurant, I got the Memphis ribs, lunch portion.  It came with about 8 bones, a side of coleslaw and jalepeno cornbread. The ribs were nice and tender and the bbq sauce wasn't too sweat.  My friend had a problem with his order, he ordered a kobe burger and the waitress brought out kobe meatballs.  Manager came over to apologize for the mix up and offered him a cup of soup while he waited for his food since the rest of out food came out.  Unfortunately since they tried to rush the burger, the burger came out well done when my friend ordered med well.  When the bill came the waitress mentioned that they didn't charge us for the burger due to the mixup.  Mistakes happen, so we were not upset, and the manager did what he could to rectify the situation.",

    "text": "Really liked this place.  As many others have said, it feels like an upscale Cheesecake Factory.  This means you're going to have tons of variety, a massive menu, and some good free bread.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table (a massive rush came in after us).  The space is huge.  There are so many tables in the back area, so the fact that it was full at 4:30-5 p.m. is a good sign.  We had some edamame to start, which was nicely seasoned and came with a great dipping sauce.  I ordered the fried chicken, which came with creamy, delicious mashed potatoes and coleslaw with peanuts.  The whole thing was delicious.  I think I ended up with about 5 pieces of fried chicken, which was a lot, so I was unable to finish it.  A little tip for those going, if you are wanting to conduct business or use your smartphone in the back area where most of the tables are, you're going to have a hard time getting a signal.  This could be good for conversation with family, but potentially difficult if you're trying to conduct business.  I would highly recommend this place.  I was a little nervous going to a sit down place at the Venetian because you never know what the pricing will be, but the Grand Lux Cafe was very reasonable.  My wife and I got drinks, an appetizer, and two full-sized entrees and spent around $40 before tip.  Check it out!",

Service was mediocre and didn't even offer us the free bread and butter, so we asked our server and 15 minutes later still no bread. We had to ask another worker for the bread we had been waiting for and he dropped it off without saying a word to us. The manager came by and stared down a waitress with a mad dog face who was in his way until she moved out of his way and really bummed the mood of the restaurant everywhere he walked... But GREAT ranch dressing, makes it all worth it. 10/10 ranch, would do again. But in all seriousness we ordered the Korean sriracha burger and it was delicious, great flavor. Just wish the service was better, they treated my boyfriend and I differently compared to others just because we are younger",

I ordered the biscuits and gravy, it took a while for them to arrive and once they did the only item on the plate hot was the egg served over it was hot.  Potatoes were warm and biscuits were cold.  It was like these tiny biscuits were pulled out of the fridge and then covered in gravy.  I immediately  told the waiter which took it away to fix it.  After 5 minutes i was disappointed and asked to cancel the order because i was discouraged by the first attempt and having to wait.  The manager eventually came after 10 minutes, apologized and offered their buffet at no cost.  They were very apologetic but the buffet was filled with similar pastries i was attempting to avoid at the conference.  There was a few hot options and a omelet bar with a long line.  I picked a few options but everything was so so.  If you have time to wait for an omelet it might be worth it.  I was not really impressed.  Breakfast Buffet at Treasure Island was better.",

The French toast churro is quite a devilish treat, but it's sweetness might be overwhelming for those who are opposed to something you can sink your teeth in for breakfast, but also has qualities of a dessert. I'm actually curious to know whether it even can be ordered as a dessert.  The exterior of the toast is totally churro quality in toast and texture and hardness. The interior is another story; its softer, spongy egg goodness.   You don't really need to add on their special syrup, but for those who desire a spike in their insulin level like me, go for it! They already drizzle Caramel chocolate syrup on it.  Really big portion sizes too. A serving size is probably one of these babies. They give you a total of four!  Very good!",

Several impressions reduced to one.   Been going to GL Venetian since built, through renovations, know it well. (GL is NOT owned by Venetian.) I am big on the Venetian, a resort set apart from most others.  But the Grand Lux no longer measures up to Venetian standards, and it's all about appeal.   How it started: Table next to me a woman with about six tons of fake dollar store jewelry tells another to \"say you didn't like it, they don't make you pay.\" She said it loud, like common information.  Although the feeling - something different - was there but ignored when I entered, the comment caused me to take that new and serious look around.   It was like I somehow was on the wrong bus. No matter your level of tolerance, the place insofar as patronage, is now more like a White Castles you might put your good sneakers on to visit at 3 in the morning.  Returning to that table, the Server picked up the book and by the look in her eyes I knew they didn't leave a tip. Stood there like she was going to breaking-point-cry. So I asked, and in fact, they jibbed the Server, didn't tip and didn't pay the entire bill. Money she is apparently obligated to cough up.   Society? Maybe. But, don't think so. After some thought and a second trip in, it occurred that GL might try to, dare I say, up prices on the menu. Stop competing down and think up, like middle and upper class. Be discriminant. Be loyal to the expectations of repeat customers.  I will be reviewing other restaurants on same stay that maintain the class and haven't submitted to cashing in their chips.  No problem with the food, nor the Service, but then, a soup kitchen atmosphere effects all and after being on the bus, what can I say, I wanted off.",

My friend and I met some awesome people and were winning at craps that we all decided we were hungry and our new friends recommended this place for late night steak. I got the filet mignon, some people got a burger, my friend shared a ribeye and got a whole bunch of appetizers to share with the table.   First of all, how do you not have fireball? this is VEGAS!!! fireball (chilled) is probably one of the easiest shots to take so early in the morning but sadly they did not have any so we got lemon drop shots.  We got this Asian inspired nacho and the sauce they use (teriyaki?) was way too sweet that you couldn't eat it. My steak was more medium than medium rare but it was tender enough to eat. Other people looked to like their food but again, it was 5AM, we were all drunk and came off from a high of winning that night.",

The whole menu was super plain and catered to serve the masses. No original line item or special ingredients. My omelette was $17 smh.   I tasted about 1/2 cup of butter on my omelette. It was pretty gross to eat. I had to munch on a side salad to balance the grease from the omelette.   They also did not have a restroom. For such a big place like this, we were asked to go to the restrooms in the casino.",

I love the quality and attention to detail in the food. The service is friendly and equitable to the food for a full experience.   My recommendation for breakfast is a simple one egg, hash browns, chicken mango sausage, and pancakes. If you're going extra indulgent, have the French toast. You can't go wrong. Thank me later !",

It used to be advertised as deep fried veggie burger and now it's just a crispy veggie burger with a boring presentation. I was wishing I ordered something different. The veggie burger was good but not great, thick and flavorful but it was not what expected from the crispness to the lack of toppings. Too soft, only offered crushed avocado on top. Kind of dry and boring all together. The Asian nachos are always amazing here, even the rice that goes with it!! Blood orange soda just ok, not enough bubble. My boyfriend liked his carbonara pasta. Slower service here but it's busy. The one in Palazzo is not open 24/hr but is advertised wrong on here. Good spot for late night snacks and people watching!",

Wonderful server who made sure we were full on drinks all the time and anything we needed she would do her best to help. I had chicken and waffles and it was delicious and for once not some heated up chicken tenders from the freezer and an amazing (house made I believe) syrup that was so wonderful over the waffle as it was covered in walnuts.  My lady had ordered the sandwich special that came with half sandwich, soup and salad. She had no complaints and was full to the brim when we left.   Would recommend for breakfast/brunch/lunch!

I essentially received a plate of lettuce with a few tomatoes, a few small pieces of chicken, a few slivers of goat cheese, maybe 10 corn kernels and no almonds or dates as advertised in the description.  I asked the server if I received the wrong plate for which she replied that is simply how it comes- mostly lettuce.  Pretty disappointed with my experience here but again, I can only speak to the salad and how I compare it to the Grand Lux in Chicago.",

I have eaten there twice, once for dinner and once for lunch and on both occasions, the food was fresh and prepared exactly how I ordered it. Most recently I had a grilled chicken salad with many substitutions and omissions: (dressing on the side, no cheese, adding avocado) I was not expecting the quality of the salad I received and the generous portion that had followed each of my instructions. That experience alone does not merit consistency but prior to that I had a chicken sandwich that wa served in a similar manner, again paying attention to my alterations. My friend who frequents Las Vegas often. ordered a French dip and he said that the one there  better than the 2 others he had in higher end restaurants. He described the meat as plentiful, tender and with the right amount of fat as to give it the flavor he craved.  The restaurant may be owned by Cheesecake Factory and if so, it explains the large menu. However this place is higher end on its quality of. the food itself especially considering that with sauces and spices removed (due to preference or allergies), the  food still satisfies \"au naturelle\", which Cheesecake could not copy.",

Although it was strips instead of whole chicken pieces, the chicken was good - crispy, juicy, flavorful - but the waffle was the star, light and absolutely delicious. Served with pecans and maple syrup. It was a very good meal. David got a ginger beef stir fry, again expecting it to be decent, but he raved about it. The beef was top notch, tender and flavorful. All the elements were perfect. He said it was the best Chinese dish he'd had in a long time.  Our server was exceptional. Very attentive. The bread he brought at the start was very good.

The menu is large and something for everyone with sandwiches and burgers, pastas, and hearty entrees with meat and potatoes.  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich and salad.  The sandwich was packed with chicken, 2 slices of tomatoes on each sandwich half and lettuce.  It was one of those open wide type sandwiches. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I devoured the salad quickly.   The others in my party were happy with their meals and the portions are large for a reasonable price.

Waited, waited, asked to see our waitress, waited, finally got up and left after a good 10 to 15 minutes with nobody coming to our table.  We were seated next to a pile of dirty dishes and towels at the next table that looked as if was abandoned half way through cleaning.  It was cleaned about 5 minutes after we sat down but we still never saw a waitress.  On the way out we told the hostess we were going somewhere else since nobody ever came to take our order.  She said oh sorry and walked away.  Won't be going there ever.....",

We chose this place as we weren't sure where else we could go and be able to sit down to nosh and chat, and, not to mention, we missed getting into Bouchon for dessert by about 15 minutes.  For a place like Grand Lux Cafe, with a nice menu of food options, I was surprised as to how limited their dessert menu was, and in particularly, how rather pedestrian was their selection:  bread pudding, chocolate cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, creme brulee.  We opted for the bread pudding and the cheesecake (since it was made with Godiva chocolate and was gluten free).  I actually liked the bread pudding better, not too sweet and not too dense.  It was a perfect accompaniment for a cup of coffee.  While the cheesecake was also good, it was a bit too sweet for me.  Service here is excellent, as is the ambiance, especially when it empties out around 10pm, and you can actually relax and have a casual conversation with your dining companion.  3.5 stars, rounding it up to 4.",

When I told her about her attitude and what how her service, she went off. I corrected her she was in the customer service business and if she is having a bad day don't take it out on the customers. When the issue was addressed to her manager the manager took her side. There was other customers complaining about this server but the manager never corrected the problem. This restaurant don't care about customer service only about how much money it is making. A bad experience here. Not worth going back",

The entree : Scampi with pasta came cold !!!!! We called a manageress who came like 20 minutes after and we said to her we want the check and feel she should not charge us and her response was you ve eaten some of it I have to charge you !!!!! That is rude and dishonest,I contested and my lovely mother 88 years old was eating with me and she is a very fragile , the manageress came back with 5 Security guards et frightened us to death ! My mum could have had a heart attack ! We paid and left immediately HORRIFIED !!!!! We went down to the lobby of the Venetian Hotel and spoke to a manager on duty he was very Apologetic to us and explained that GranLuxCafe belongs to the CheeseFactory group ! My mum bursted in tears and I rang the horrible rude manageress to tell her we would sue her for publically shaming us so rudely ! She called Security again and they came after us as if we were criminals or delinquents , in our entire lives never anything like that happened to us ! It was HORRIFIC, they interrogated me for 1 hour shaming me publically !!!!! We were the victims of a cold bad meal and we had no right to complain ! I rang the Headquarters of CheeseFactory and they parted up with their employee by lying and saying the manageress felt threatened !  What a Machiavelic mind this  lady has . We will never return EVER again to any of the Restaurants of the CheeseFactory group. AVOID THIS ABUSIVE RUDE GRAN LUX CAFE inside Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas that is the advice I am giving to Yelpers . Hope this information was useful to all readers.",

    "text": "Located in the Venetian, this place is definitely value for money compared to the other dining options in many of the hotels. Plus is it open 24 hours......  We walked in here at 11pm on a Tuesday and were greeted and quickly seated. Our server however, was not a happy camper that day. It took her 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence or ask us for our drink order. Since we were starving, this annoyed us a little more that day. Avoiding another delay, we ordered everything at once. Once she had our order, she huffed and puffed away.   BTW I must mention that this place is similar to the Cheesecake Factory (or so I was told when we checked in to the Venetian). Based on the menu, I can agree a 100%. It was 10 pages long - you have small plates, almost big plates, big plates etc. and the prices seemed to match those at the Cheesecake Factory. It took me 10 minutes to find what I wanted to eat and that also after scanning through only half the menu - maybe that is why the service is so slow - they like to give you time to go through the entire menu :)  Sourdough bread is complimentary, however it was hard and dry and not comparable to nice warm bread. Maybe this is something the restaurant can change.   For our food, we got the Asian nachos (based on the yelp comments and reviews) and volcano shrimp to start off. The Asian nachos are a MUST TRY. The nachos are freshly baked, crispy, with a sweet sesame topping, chicken, cheese and rice. The chicken is tangy and juicy, and the cheese does not overload the nachos (which is usually what I find on most occasions). The volcano shrimp were fried shrimp (the regular) but the dipping sauce was interestingly tasty - Spicy Chilli Aioli.   For the entree, I ordered the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken and my wife got the Pasta Pomodoro. Both these plates were good enough for 2 people each (so all in all we got food that could feed 4). I enjoyed my Indochine Shrimp and Chicken, even though it was on the sweeter side with raisins and really lacked the Indian spices it claimed to have. The chicken in this dish was probably a little under-seasoned but the shrimp counterbalanced the chicken in this case. My wife's Pomodoro was plain pasta in tomato sauce and nothing really out of the blue, other than a huge plate of food.  We waited another 15 minutes after finishing to get our check before walking out satiated though not thoroughly happy. The lack of seasoning and flavor in the Chicken (Indochine Shrimp and Chicken) and pasta (Pomodoro), and the poor service makes me give the place a 3 stars.",

    "text": "This past Monday,  thought I would grab a light dinner of eggs & home fries as it was late. Asked the waiter for the kitchen to not add any extra salt to my food. A simple request. The Waiter was very pleasant and said it would be no problem. After around 10 min the manager came over and said the home fries were fairly salty, and it would take a little longer, but  she was having the kitchen freshly grate and prepare the potatoes without any salt. Thought this extra touch was so wonderful. Worthy of 5 stars! But that's when this tale takes a very different turn...45 minutes went by... still no eggs and home fries. I asked both the waiter and manager why the long wait. I Was told it would be right out. What I received after waiting almost an hour were three extremely rubbery hard yolked fried eggs (ordered over medium) obviously sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time). The \"freshly made\" home fries had the entire crunchy browned top removed and were extremely salty. So basically the kitchen took conventional home fries and removed the top, rather than making fresh, hoping it would go unnoticed... UNBELIEVABLE!!!. At this point, I was angry and hungry, got up and decided it was time to leave. Once again I spoke to the \"twenty something\" manager who professed her apologies and then had the audacity to say to me \"Ok we won't charge you for your meal\". REALLY!!!!!' There was no consumption...I just cut into the eggs and saw they were inedible, then tasted the home fries, which I immediately spit out.  I ended up getting a yogurt at the Venetian store. Will NEVER EVER go back to this restaurant again!!! So many great places to eat in Vegas, do yourself a huge favor and go elsewhere! Grand Lux SUCKS!",

Day 2 I ordered dessert, which should have been ready in no less than 10 minutes. I waited again & it took over 30! Wasn't anything that had to be cooked. Just dessert. RIDICULOUS! Thankfully the manager gave me a refund & a bottle of water. Seems if you order to go, you aren't as much of a priority as those dining in. Good service should extend throughout your establishment.

    "text": "By request I was asked not to say anything by my family because they did not want a damper on our family trip and wanted to keep it positive. As \"nice\" as everyone is, there are a few important key qualities that were missing from this experience. We were a party of 11 and understandably at a restaurant it may be difficult to get everyone's food out hot and at the same time.   I'm going to start with there was 45 minute wait, great no problem, it's delicious food. We sat down and drink orders were taken, and not delivered for a while. I know it may be tough to understand if you don't have kids yourself, but when someone has a two year old, please bring the child's drink out... ASAP. No matter how busy your kitchen is, it doesn't take more than a few minutes to bring out Apple juice, not 10. Then after 15 minutes we sent someone to ask for the bread basket to hold us over, until the rest of our drinks arrived and food order was taken.  I ordered the Braised Pot Roast, delicious. It came out with the broccoli cold, I literally handed a piece to the server when they came back... He didn't seem like he knew exactly how to respond to that because it was so obvious. They took my (and my cousins plate who ordered the same)  back, promised new sides and hot plate. This time veggies and potatoes hot, but the inside of the pot roast was cold. Might want to check in the re-heating protocol so you know the outcome.  Needless to say we were starving and ate our dishes anyways.   I was not a fan of how this was handled and wasn't even offered a manager or a discount to appease this annoying situation. I feel like we were treated as is our business didn't matter because they are such a busy establishment. I won't be suggesting this restaurant any longer, whether I'm in Houston, Vegas, or Scottsdale...",

(Note: The Grand Lux in Venetian Hotel is open 24 hours everyday, which is a great place for a late-night meal! Don't get this confused with the Grand Lux in the Palazzo because they do have different hours there)   Food was delicious. Comes with bread and butter. I ordered the Asian Nachos and it was the perfect appetizer with that wonton crisp! Also ordered the pulled pork sandwich and that was one of the most tender pulled pork I've ever had! So good! Prices are mostly under $25, which is pretty good for the portions you get. Service, eh it was just okay. But definitely will be going back!",

It was a tomato basil mozzarella pasta very simple and good! We did find a piece of hair in it.... the manger came by to apologize & handled it very well. I appreciated that. They offered us a salad or soup on the house and asked if we'd like a new dish. JBH liked the one he had chose so he just ordered the same thing. Oh yeah the pasta had grilled chicken! It was cooked quite well. I tend to not order chicken because places always cook it so dry! But not here that's for sue. I'd definitely come here to try something else. Their menu has many options & it was kindof hard for me to decide lol. This always happens to me.",

    "text": "This afternoon on a staycation with family, we ate in the Grand Lux Cafe.With a location in the Venetian, I felt like I was transplanted to a cafe in Venice.    Grand Lux Cafe is the upscale brand of the Cheesecake Factory. The restaurants are upscale with decent prices. They include a bar and bakery.   The Cheesecake Factory website states that the Grand Lux Cafe came into existence when the Venetian asked David Overton, who was the founder of Cheesecake Factory to design an upscale restaurant for his resort. The story goes that he went all over Europe doing culinary research. The research resulted in the very first Grand Lux Cafe-where we had lunch this afternoon.     Our experience was that Grand Lux Cafe is upscale and affordable. Our table overlooked the extravagant Venetian.    In my opinion, where the menu shines is the lunch special. It is from 11 to 5. The lunch specials include Lunch soup/ salad ($10.95), Rustic pizza & salad ($11.95), Lunch salad ($9.95-11.95), Lunch enchiladas ($11.95), Lunch pasta & salad ($10.95-$11.15), and Lunch salmon ($13.25).    I was going to order the Lunch pasta & salad. When I asked the Waitress if the lunch portion is enough to fill you up, she answered that depends on your appetite. With that nebulous answer, I ordered the BLT with french fries. I don't think this was the kind of dish that David Overton was researching in Europe. Overall I was happy with the food.    I enjoyed having lunch in Grand Lux Cafe. I was off from work and with family. It is not too often that I get to have lunch in Venice. It was a change of scenery with good food that I appreciated. I am showing this appreciation with a 4 star rating.  The Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 50.",

I've been here a couple of times with a party of four or greater - of course here on business. It's pretty relaxing considering how crowded it can be. During my visit, the wait staff was very attentive, kept our water filled at all times. And kept on bringing warm bread.   One thing I found interesting is how they broadcast their recent health and safety inspection - a wall dedicated to letter A's. It's actually quite nice.   Food was pretty good considering the cost, and I must say, wait times on food is exceptional considering the crowd. During a tradeshow evening, this place was jammed packed - and we got our food in about 15 minutes. Very quick considering the crowd.   I had the Spaghetti with Clams and Shrimp. Good portions of food - although, I would've preferred less Clams and Shrimp. It seemed a bit much.   I also tried the Keylime pie - it was much larger than I expected - so, consider that a warning for those who have a desire with dessert.   If your crew isn't sure of what to eat, then bring them here - a relaxing atmosphere, where there something for everyone to eat.",

First, it's conveniently located within the hotel (for you guests) and not a far walk away from the meeting/convention rooms (for people like me). There was no wait the several times I went, although it was busy but the space is large enough to accommodate indoor seating and artificial outdoor seating (it's not technically outdoors because you're outside of the main restaurant but still within the walkways/slot machine of the hotel and people are walking by as you eat).  Anyhow, let me tell you.. first let's start with the FREE bread.. my enemy. I love eating the inside soft part only and leaving the crust, and my colleague likes eating the crust and not the inside. Something for everyone.  As for the menu, everything is delicious.... except for this fish dish that was too lemon=y and I sent It back and ordered something else. I thought it was just me but my colleague ordered the same thing and sent it back also. They were gracious about it. The servers are all friendly. Maybe they hate you on the inside but they don't act like it on the outside.   Next, the portions are HUUUUGE... Yes, it could cost $15-20 for some plates (my madeira chicken and pot roast were each $18.95 according to my receipt) but you could split it with 2 people or take it to go and it's totally affordable. I have a HEALTHY appetite and I would always have an actual half of my meal to go because it was so huge. That is always a plus in my book when I can eat until I'm about to burst and still have enough leftover to feed me for another meal....   The prices are extremely reasonable. I'm looking at an old receipt and apparently my thai fried chicken was $12.95 and a kids mac n cheese was $5.95. Definitely reasonably priced. Considering the portions and quality, it is worth it. A large selection of comfort foods, pasta, Asian inspired dished with an American flare, etc... definitely something for everyone, including kids. This is like Denny's or IHOP's older, fancier, more handsome, brother...  Plus you know a place is great when I ate there several days in a row and ordered something different every single time and still had a great experience... CANT WAIT TO PLAN A TRIP BACK TO VEGAS JUST SO I CAN EAT HERE AGAIN... LOL",

    "text": "If you are a fan of the Cheesecake Factory then a trip to the Grand Luxe Cafe should be on your list when in Vegas.   Owned by the Cheesecake Factory so you will see the similarities. Solid plates served with panache but with a comfort food twist to it. Everything you get here is big, and tasty! Menu is large, and if you can't find something to eat here then you might as well just go get a candy bar. Plus, they have those great slices of cheescake made by the parent company.  I love coming here for lunch and getting the half sandwich and soup special. Also comes with a salad. Great deal for $10, and you get more than enough on the plate to satisfy. Also, many salads, burgers, sandwiches and so much more to choose from. Decent prices for what you get here.  Plus, the actual place is large and beautifully decorated. A lot of attention to detail went into the planning of this location. Another cool thing is to get a seat in the fake front outside patio area to people watch. Sometimes you can see a real freak show walk by here in Vegas where anything goes!",

It was a small buffet with pastries, bread, bagel, oat meals, cereal, bacon, ham, hash brown, scrambled eggs, fruits and an egg station. It's really good. The orange juice was fresh. The coffee also not bad. Service also very prompt and helpful. Nice breakfast to start a day",

There are so many great buffets for the same price though. Not memorable enough to go back...",

I wanted to get something extra special and when I saw the Grand Lux Cafe French toast which is made of EXTRA thick slices of Brioche Bread, I knew I had to get it. The toast is so massive that the waiter even had to ask me if the size of the French toast was okay. I thought that was rather odd but I happily said I was okay with that. Helloooo, more food the better because that means leftovers! The cappuccino was disappointing. It was bubbly, not foamy.",

    "text": "This is usually a good restaurant that I visit at least once every 2 trips to Vegas. Not this time. This trip we took with 4 other friends and have went here 3 times.  The last 2 are the reason for this review. We ate breakfast yesterday, I ordered a simple egg white scramble with fruit. I had to send the eggs back 2 times, once because they weren't only whites and the 2nd because they had so much oil on them they looked wet from across the table. It made my stomach upset, even the new batch had oil after I requested none. Second trip was last night, we wanted a midnight snack and after ordering the loaded potato rolls 3 days ago we ordered them again,  no bacon this time plus hummus and a personal margherita pizza for the hubby. The pizza was good he said, but the potato rolls were awful. They came just as I ordered but add you can see, there are barely any potatoes in the STUFFED rolls. We basically had fried wonton wrappers :/ . I won't go on and on, I'll just say we won't be going back again unless it's for the Belgian waffle, but you can get those almost anywhere, I prefer healthy eggs.",

The Brussel sprouts that were with the meal were just the shavings of the outside layer without the meat of the whole veggie. Overall a satisfying meal.  Chicken pot pie - a large portion ( could share with another person ). The inside of the pot pie must have a white wine base with the layers of flavors. The inside of the pot pie was almost like a savory chicken stew with big chunks of moist chicken, potatoes and veggies. The flaky topping was also an enjoyable experience for the taste buds.",

The breakfast buffet is kept hidden in a room off the dining areas, so you don't get to see it as you're waiting or being seated.  We sat down and saw the buffet on the menu at $18.95 a person.  Not seeing anything on the menu that immediately got my attention I opted to go with that.  I mean it's Vegas, and the Buffets are amazing right?  Not this one.  Very basic options, hash browns, sausage, bacon, oatmeal.  Some pastries, breads for toasting and a fruit bar. There was also an omelette bar.  Two guys fixing omelettes (basic ham, sausage, cheese, mushrooms, onions and spinach fixings) or over easy eggs.  That's it.  That's your Breakfast Buffet.  Embassy Suites has a better breakfast buffet and they don't charge you $18.95.  Our server was great, we didn't have to wait long for a table even though the line was very long and I can't say much about the rest of the food on the menu, but if you're looking for an amazing, Las Vegas style breakfast buffet, look elsewhere.  This place doesn't have it.",

We got fettuccini Alfredo and the caramel chicken. We also had the quesadilla appetizer and red velvet cake for desert. Everything we had was well made and good portion sizes for what you pay. The food wasn't cheap but you get exactly what you pay for. A couple could probably eat an appetizer and 2 entrees for under $50 which is not bad compared to the other restaurants in the area.   Overall a very pleasant experience and we will definitely come back next time we're in Vegas. Highly recommend.",

This is a great sandwich. It's not sloppy as you'd think with the ingredients. Only a little spicy. Wife had the fettuccine alfredo with Shrimp which she did not complain about.

The cafe is easy to find coming off of the parking garage elevators, it's a quick jaunt across the casino floor. We were sat right away by a pleasant hostess and received a booth as requested. The decor is beautiful in this cafe and the ceiling is simply stunning. It is a work of art, very beautiful.  Here's some pros & cons during my visit:  PRO's 1.) Large food selection 2.) Delicious, complimentary bread basket 3.) Great wait staff - courteous, helpful and kind 4.) Fantastic pot roast French fry appetizer (I recommend), yummy Manhattan salad and penne with a silky, smooth alfredo sauce 5.) Huge portions, easy to share  CONS's 1.) Food brought out wrong the first time and had to wait while they remade it 2.) Very pricey - think upscale, Cheesecake Factory 3.) Large food selection - I spent 20 minutes flipping through this huge menu trying to decide on something to eat 4.) The server we got was not knowledgeable on the menu. I asked simple questions like \"what pasta does this dish come with?\" and he didn't know.  All-in-all, I would definitely visit again for lunch, however I don't see myself coming for dinner service. I can see how this is a great spot for tourists or hotel guests though. Make sure you have more than a 1 hour lunch before eating here. It does take a bit of time.",

First off, excellent service with amazing memory because the bartender Raymond remembered me from 3 months before and I don't think it's just me - he welcomed everyone with a smile and amazing service. The food is SO good.  We had the Volcano Shimp (which reminds me of the BangBang Shrimp at Bonefish Grill which I love and I loved these just as much). I fought the urge to go full feed bag and ordered the Kale & Warm Grains salad. What was so great about THIS salad is that I was able to feel full, satisfied AND smug! ok, fine, I ordered a side of fries as an afterthought. My friend at the Chicken and Waffles - OH so good. I was barely able to convince him to give me a bite! He was #SorryNotSorry about it too. ;)",

That place and time was for a late night snack after drinking and running around the strip.  The food and price is good. Not amazing, but it's basically Cheesecake Factory. So expect that quality.  The real trick is that they have take out next door. So.... After about 1:30am in Vegas, we all know either food joints shut down or they have huge lines. And grand luxe did. So maybe I'm reviewing the wrong place, but I know the food was from grand lux.  Next door n the little cafe, you can order take out. And they have a perfect selection of perfectly creamy and satisfying pastas.   Pasta carbonara is always a winner. They'll load you up. You can feed one very hungry and drunk man. Two small drunk men and prob three to four small .... Kids?  They load you up with bread too.  We were done showering, eating comfortably in pj's in our room while our friends just finally got seated at the oyster bar over at imperial station.... Which I might add... We drove back from because the wait was so long...",

However, a sign said it would only take 5-7 mins to get seated which is 100 percent accurate. The issue was that it too about 15 mins before we even got ask for our drinks and it took about 20 mins to get our food.   The food itself was okay. We got the Baja omelette, joe's scrambled, and the hash. The good was pretty good (it should be for the price). I asked for a sausage to be added to my omelette, but the forgot that no big deal. Also, the omelette was more like a ton of onions and peppers under some eggs; it wasn't really omelette, but that's not that big of a deal. The hash and joes scramble was great.   Going back to the service...its just slow. Ask for some coffee wait 10 mins. Ask for creamer wait 10 mins. The waiters are just overloaded with tables to serve. It's a huge location and the slow down in breakfast service reflects it.   I wouldn't come back here for breakfast.",

The entrees we ordered were amazing, especially for the price points which were great for the quality. I'd recommended coming here for the food.  SERVICE: VERY POOR. Each time we sat at the bar, and each time, the service was very poor. While we would be greeted in a timely manner, it was all down hill from there. Each time there, my drink would sit empty. I would have to request the refill each time. Additionally, there was no \"check back\" once our food came out. If you wanted anything additional, you'd have to ask for it. They were quick to put your bill in front of you (which was nice); however, I'd place my card on top the check, and it would set there for 30 minutes before I had to request the bill to be paid. Also, another server brought us our entrees. I requested for some additional items (silverware, ketchup, etc) and none of the items were brought. I had to flag down our inattentive bartender to obtain the items, which I got 8 minutes later. There were many other issues as well, but I will stop here.",

Since they closed the Beverly Hills location, I always have an excuse to visit Vegas just to come here. Everything I eat is of high quality and taste. I almost skip dinner just to get to the delicious desserts.   Some of my favorites are:  Short Rib Fries w/Gravy and Cheese from the small bites section Jumbo Fried Shrimp from the seafood section Deep Fried Buffalo Rolls From the appetizer section  And Now For Dessert....  The Bread Pudding with Whiskey Glaze Butterscotch Pudding with Caramel Popcorn Topping Buttercake   and so much more. They even have a section for dessert where they bake it fresh for you. You order it before your entree so its hot and fresh by the time your ready to consume. The ambiance is elegant and semi-low light. The hostess and staff are friendly and I just can't get enough of this place.",

The shortcake was pretty amazing, the biscuit was perfect and the ratio of strawberries to whipped cream to biscuit to ice cream was perfection.

Came with a party of 12+ we ordered a a bit of everything to pasta and rice entrees. The Asian influenced rice dished were a bit sweet ...from the curry and the So called orange chicken. I guess we couldn't expect more Asian flavors from an American franchise, but we wanted to try it and we had older relatives who were not use to the Western type of food.  The Asian nachos were interesting...was hoping for a great flavor profile from what i read...but it was overly too sweet from the drenched peanut mix sauce they used.    The service was great and friendly... constant refills and checkups.    Overall food was a miss this time, but will come back but gonna steer away from the Asian fusion/influenced foods.",

It's an excellent dish with good tasting, deep fried battered chicken with a caramel glaze.  The glaze is a bit on the sweet side, but I like it.  Last night, I stayed True to form and ordered that.  I had a choice of brown or white rice and I went with the brown.  DInner was very good.  My wife had the Madeira chicken.  It was served with very creamy, good tasting mashed potatoes.  We shared a piece of chocolate cake for dessert.  It was huge.  Service was a bit slow last night, but we got here at the height of the busy time with people wanting to have dinner before going to see Phantom as was the case with us.  We had plenty of time and I didn't obsess with the time factor because I knew we were good.  Our server boxed our leftovers--dinner tonight--and brought it back quickly.  I had time to walk it to the car in the garage and put it in the cooler I brought anticipating a take out box or boxes.  I wish they had more large small plates on their menu.  Or if they would just downsize any of their meals for a downsized price.  My only complaint with Grand Lux is the level of the music.  It was not on when we first arrived. 10 minutes later, someone must have realized and they fired up the sound system.  At one point, it was so loud, I had to almost yell for my wife to hear me.  It got so bad, I downloaded an app for my iPhone and the decibel level averaged about 85 all the time we were there.  At times it spiked in the 90s and near 100.  That's just too loud!!

They brought our drinks pretty quickly. Later the server said that they couldn't make the pizza half cheese and meats/mush  the other half because the bases are different.  They brought out some bread to munch on. The bread was very very good. We asked for more bread-the server never brought any more.   It seemed to take as while to get the food but don't remember how long it too.   A co-worker ordered the four cheese pizza so we I gave him four pieces of my pizza and he gave me four pieces of his pizza so I could take it home for my kids.   The meats/mush pizza wad good but very salty.  My co-worker said the cheese was not nearly as salty.  Maybe it was from the pepperoni and sausage.  My water was filled once when I was halfway early on during our visit but not once afterwards. Others had water and iced teas, but it wasn't filled either.   Couldn't make half cheese half meat/mush pizza, super salty pizza, no refill for drinks after getting our food, and no requested bread makes for a subpar rating.",

Our server, despite this being a pretty casual restaurant, was so good at his job, was fun, upbeat, and all the bells and whistles.   Aside from my husband's home cooked steak and jalapeno breakfast burritos, I think I had my second best breakfast ever. And my god, do they give you so much food! They gave me six sausage links in my standard breakfast, for example.  If you're waking up at 2 pm and looking for breakfast, head straight to Grand Lux. It was a wonderful surprise.",

    "text": "You know a place is awesome if the salad dressing is served in a gravy boat! With delicious food and extraordinary service, this Grand Lux at the Venetian is also open 24 hours! Note: the one at the Palazzo does close around 2/3 am..(and why do the connected casinos need 2 Grand Lux's on each end again?)  If a breakfast buffet is what you're craving, this Grand Lux lays out a hearty display of hot and cold breakfast items + beverage for a reasonable $16.50 (served until 11 weekdays, 12:30 weekends)   Though we were here during brunch hours and both the bf and I love breakfast foods, we wanted a filling lunch. I had the Pasta Carbonara lunch combo, and opted for the fresh organic side salad with ranch dressing IN A GRAVY BOAT! I've always been hesitant ordering Pasta Carbonara, afraid the overall taste of the dish will come out too sweet, but Grand Lux did their Pasta Carbonara right! It was so savory.. but not overly salty, and a hint of sweet from the bacon. I was in love with this ginormous entree!  I've always heard the Grand Lux described as an upgraded Cheesecake Factory, so I was expecting higher prices. Surprisingly, the sister restaurant chains have comparable, if not identical, pricing schemes.  Service here was top-notch! I don't remember our waitress' name, but she made us feel so comfortable. She came like every 5 minutes, but was the complete opposite from intrusive. She also kept apologizing for the wait (what wait? we didn't even notice that the food was taking longer than usual), and letting us know our food would be out soon. The manager even came to our table on a separate occasion, and apologized more for our food delay.   There are so many great dining options along the Strip, with Grand Lux being one of them. Though realistically, I will not be eating here every time I visit Vegas, this is now one of spots on the top of my list!",

You could hardly taste the pastrami/cornbeef because there was hardly none. As far as the fries went they should have been STEAK FRIES not your normal close as you can get shoe-string fries. And the potatoes should have been fresh NOT frozen out the bag. I gotta say this was one of the WORST Rueben sandwiches I ever had in Vegas and coming from a 5**** Casino/Resort/Spa...You be shamed. You really need to take lessons from the Marriot /Rampart at there Deli..Now theres is a helluva sandwich the sandwich is so big I can hardly get my mouth around it.

Our waitress was a bit too efficient as she quickly gave us menus and brought us menus. Less then a few minutes after handing us the menus she asked if we were ready to order. Considering the menu was quite extensive, a few in our party needed more time before ordering. She hovered til people ordered which bothered me a little.   I settled on getting the lunch special half sandwich, salad and soup combo. I decided on the chicken salad sandwich, mushroom barley soup. The sandwich was very delicious but the wedge of lettuce in it was a bit overkill. The salad was a vinaigrette and was really good. The mushroom barley soup was a bit salty for my taste.   What I also liked was at the end when we got the bill that gratuity was not already included (like most other places)",

    "text": "I have eaten at Grand Lux Cafe a total of 3 times. The first two times were good, which is why I was stunned at how horribly my third experience was. It was by far the worst dining experience I have had in my adult life.  To give some context, a group of myself and two of my friends decided to celebrate the last day of our Vegas trip. One friend had won some money and another had recently been accepted into Law School, and we were staying at the Venetian. Our show tickets had just been canceled, and we were looking to save the night. Having had good experiences before, I recommended Grand Lux Cafe.  The night started off with us being seated at the edge of the restaurant close to the casino. We were not big fans of the table, so we asked to be moved and the hostess quickly accommodated. Props to the hostess and waiter.  After that, everything went downhill. First, we ordered Prosecco for the table. My friend clearly pointed out the specific bottle and vineyard. The waiter then returned with a bottle of Rose and wine glasses. When we asked if this was the correct bottle, the waiter replied, \"Yes.\" Not convinced (why was it pink), one of my friends inspects the bottle and points out this is not the correct bottle. He also points out that Prosecco is generally served in champagne flutes and not wine glasses, and if the restaurant had flutes. At this point, the waiter apologizes, the first of many, and then gets the correct bottle and glasses. He then proceeds to heavily struggle in opening the bottle (not his fault), and finally is able to get us our drink.  We then place our order: 2 filet mignons w/ asparagus, a fried calamari to share, and a BLT. I do not know how we could have made it simpler. The calamari comes out pretty quickly. I liked it even if it was heavy on the batter: 4/5.  When our dishes come out, a different server brings over the BLT, a filet mignon w/ asparagus, and a ribeye w/ asparagus. We say we ordered two filet mignons. The server looked flustered and went to go ask our waiter what happened. After a few minutes, the waiter comes over and apologizes and says there was a mixup and he will put in another order of the Filet. My friends start eating because filet mignon is not cheap, and says the asparagus is completely unseasoned. Meanwhile, I'm just twiddling my thumbs. Strike #2. At least the manager came by and apologized for the inconvenience.  After 15 minutes, the waiter comes and says another table took my second order and he just put in another order. That's strike #3. At this point my friends are almost done eating, and my steak is nowhere close to being done. I call back the waiter and tell him to cancel the order. I tell him I do not want the order, am no longer hungry after bread and calamari, and would like the check.  The waiter leaves, and 2 min later, the manager comes with my steak. At this point, I am about to blow a gasket. The night has been ruined, and somehow nothing I say is getting to this waiter. I tell the manager I cancelled the steak and would just like it removed the check. I just want to pay my tab. At this point, the manager started urging me to eat the steak. He kept repeating that \"he didn't want to waste a steak\" and that \"I should take a few bites, he doesn't want me to be hungry.\" When you have to keep repeating to the manager that NO I DO NOT WANT THIS, a restaurant has completely broken down in every possible way. This last interaction left me embarrassed as the manager made me feel like the bad guy for wasting food. I cancelled the order, and the kitchen still made it. Obviously, there was no issue in taking my order the second time and giving it to someone else so why not just give it to someone else? Or eat it yourself if you don't want to waste it, jesus christ.   The manager \"comped\" us for the steak and calamari, but not the other two items or the prosecco (which we would not have gotten if we had not corrected the waiter).   Not only did Grand Lux \"Cafe\" make me foolish in front of my friends for recommending this place, it made me feel small after messing up my order, and there is a clear breakdown in communication in the kitchen or staff training. I will not be returning to this \"restaurant\", and I do not plan on staying at the Venetian again after this experience.",

There is this quaint AYCE room hidden in the cut. I called over to the hotel to see how much they charge and the front desk rep said $19.99, so I thought that was decent. Turns out, the actual price was $24.95 for the buffet -__-.   Kinda wish I was aware of that beforehand. Still for a smaller scale buffet, it had some righteous offerings.   We immersed ourselves in a bit of everything. Omelettes, salads, chicken, pasta, ribs, sandwiches, coffee, fruit and some petite desserts. All good quality, so my high expectations were positively met. Missed out on the pancakes and waffles, just forgot to grab some :(  2 things which could have made the experience better? Less noise in the restaurant (does a more quiet seating area even exist?) and they could have bussed our table more often and provided coffee or water refills. Other than that, food was satisfying and overall we had a lovely brunch.",

My review is on their breakfast buffet.  Its not as huge as your casino buffets but the food is higher quality and simply awesome!  There is an egg/omlete station....the omletes are soooooo yummy.  They have bacon, hash browns, sausage links and as of this year now have ham.  There is sour dough bread, english muffins and bagels which you can toast.  The fruit is much fresher than in your traditional buffets.  My only somewhat of a complaint is the pastry selection needs an little makeover.  They have had the same selection for years now and it gets a bit boring.  Oh and also as of this year they have belgium waffles which were great!!!....the chocolate chips to sprinkle on made them super good!  Another plus is you get ALL the beverages you want included in the price.  I know this is relatively standard in buffets but where do you get FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice?  NO ONE has orange juice like the Grand Lux!!!   If you are debating whether to go to the Grand Lux in the Palazzo or Venetian I say definetly the Venetian....while the one in Palazzo is quite pretty inside there is something about the Venetian that really stands out and makes it my fav!",

Personally, we witness a drunk bastard spill his drink all over the floor and walked off. The hostess immediately wipe the floor clean without any complaints. That is great customer service! I applaud the hostess for her patience.  This is our order:  Buffalo wings with ranch sauce  margarita pizza with pepperoni",

Also have reduced price beverages and other reduced price appetizers. We ordered 3 of the $6.50 appetizers and ended up having leftovers - the servings are so generous. The cheeseburger sliders were our favorites. Burger had a nice char on the outside while still being pink inside. The crispy Thai chicken shrimp spring rolls and stacked chicken quesadilla were also delicious. Our server was so attentive. Husband was unusually thirsty and she did not let his water glass get empty. Brought us a basket of their sourdough bread (warm) even though we were not having dinner. The bread is fantastic - very crunchy crust, soft interior.",

Before we ordered they brought us water & bread & butter. The bread & butter was so good! It tasted like the Cheesecake Factory bread. The water tasted good not like crappy sink water.

Once it's after 11 a.m. (on the dot), you only have the breakfast buffet option. I've done both, but prefer the sit-down breakfast menu option.   It's a large place with a family atmosphere.

Since we don't have Grand Luxe Cafe's in CA, I was hoping for a better experience; however, my chocolate chip cookies weren't bad, and my lemon drop Martini was cool, so I might go back for those reasons, but  I do NOT recommend their Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya...at least not from this location!",

I got the chicken tortilla soup and chicken royale with mashed potatoes and greens beans and carrots. The chicken was breaded and cooked perfectly. The mashed taters were a touch dry but tasty. Veggies were ok. It was my wife's bday so the staff rustled up something nice for dessert which was a nice touch. Service was outstanding. Give Chris a raise!!",

Ron told us the server for our section was busy in the back. I would definitely recommend grand lux for good food and big portions. And recommend ron as a server he was very polite and apologetic toward my concerns!! I rate five for the service from the server I had but the rest of the employees could use a little customer service pointers. The hostess really seemed upset to be at work and didn't try to even converse with us. The main point is I was upset about the limited menu, but our server literally broke down the process as to why they don't have some menu items which made me choice other items that he choose and recommended.",

My party had to to-go more than half of my food because the amount was ridiculous (and delicious afterward too). The service may be a bit slow, but they were very kind and helpful. It was so good that we came here before we left Vegas as well. If you like cheesecake factory, it's owned by them (but the food is way better in my opinion). Their menu is also double the size of what cheesecake factory offers, and it is open 24 hours! Insane. The only downside is that they don't have cheesecake, BUT they do have a variety of dessert that may satisfy your sweet tooth. Would definitely recommend if you need to load up on some yummy carbs or enjoy a classic American meal.",

    "text": "How can a place give two dishes, one so full of flavor and the other totally bland ?  Let me say straight off, I really wish there was a Grand Lux somewhere other than the Venetian or the Palazzo, the casinos themselves are very nice, spotlessly clean, but the management insists on adding over powering fragrances to the AC supply, I know I am not the only one to find this annoying, but in my case at the minimum I am getting a bad headache from it.  Anyways, the powers that be (wife) decided she wanted to pit the grilled cheese and short rib sandwich we had just tried at Fat Choy against the offering at Grand Lux. For me it is a no brainer, the Asian Nachos all the way.  Order in quickly, food out quickly, the Asian Nachos, superb as ever (the only reason I brave the smell of this casino is for this dish, yes they are that good), the grilled cheese.  Well totally tasteless, whoever figured it would be a good idea to use swiss cheese, please make them eat 20 of these things and then tell me it's good.  The short rib could have been the saviour, but it seemed to me that it had be have been flavored in 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and a few trace bits thrown in for taste, well ok it's air..The meat had no taste either.  So on one hand you have a great dish (the nachos), on the other a lousy dish (the sandwich).  Oh well, live and learn, the service was good, my drink refilled quickly.",

It's probably your fault you can't hear me, so just ask me to repeat myself (3) Party of 9, yes we fucking know there's gratuity added. It's on the bill. But when I ask for 10 dollars on my card, it's because we rather you get a cash tip asshole. Don't fucking run my card and tack on gratuity!  (4) I'm going to stereotype my own race, we were all Asian, we know how to fucking do the math. We aren't going to shiest you on your bill, so don't fucking tell us that we're short 57 cents! WE'RE SHORT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADD. Our server had to pull out her OWN wallet to pay me my money back. EMBARASSING.  Denny's does a better job than you and they're not even high end!

Mr. Timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriend's employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals.  I've never seen someone lose their cool like that, especially not a manager.  There are many better options for restaurants within this casino.  Beware!",

Well, you go to Grand Lux Cafe :)  I was staying in Venetian with my wife and was looking for some food joint near by. Grand Lux Cafe came to our mind since we liked the complimentary breakfast here. We ordered  Veggie Burger, Margarita Pizza and Garden Omelette. Here is what we liked about this cafe: 1. Food was just awesome. It was so tasty that we ended up eating a lot more  2. Serving size was much more than we expected(at least if I compare that to Gordon Ramsay Burgr)  3. Ambience is really really good  4. It is not costly at all  5. Wide variety of options to choose from. Me and my wife are eggetarian and even we could find sufficient number of options to choose from  6. It is open 24 hrs  Something not to miss in Vegas !",

Price - $94.14 (including tax and tip, 3 people ordered) Seafood - Yes, Calamari, ahi, etc. Meats - Yes, beef, chicken, pork, duck, etc. Vegetables - Yes, salads Dessert - Yes, variety of cakes, pies, cupcakes, etc Fruits - Yes Other - (1) Located on the First Floor of the Venetian Casino floor between the Casino Cages and Food Court, (2) Review is for Venetian-side Grand Lux Cafe--not Palazzo-side.  (3) Grand Lux Cafe was created by David Overton (founder of Cheesecake Factory Restaurants), (4) Accept all major credit cards  What was ordered:  Customer Service (Complimentary) - Excellent - Jessica K was our server for this Wed 11:30 pm dining session.  Jessica was very personable and made great small talk about why we were here.  I was taking pictures of my friends and she offered to take a picture of me as well.  I declined, but she snatched my camera and proceeded to take my picture stating that I got pictures of my friends so it was only fair that I get a picture as well.  Jessica then offered to take a picture of all 3 of us afterwards.  Other than that, brought us everything we needed with a smile.  Nice gal.  Rib Eye Steak ($30.95) - Excellent - Cooked medium rare rib eye steak served with 2 onion rings, sprig of greens, and French fries.  Let me deconstruct the meal while I deconstruct the meal:  Rib Eye Steak - Excellent - Per Grand Lux Cafe menu \"We serve the finest Certified Angus Beef, corn-fed and aged up to 4 weeks for flavor, then seasoned and broiled at 1600 degrees to seal in the juices.\"  Quantity: Nice, large slab of meat.  Approximately 9 inches in length, 4.5 inches in width, and 1 inch in thickness.  Quality: Excellent.  The steak came with some fat, but it was quite meaty--I ate the fat because it's delicious (don't judge).  They cooked it to perfection with a nice pinkish middle and still juicy.  The steak pretty much melted in your mouth like butter.  Flavor: I don't know how else to describe it, but as \"Awesome and delicious!\"  Very flavorful beef that I was tempted to order another.  Other: My friend M ordered the same thing, but cooked medium.  He could not stop \"ooo\" and \"aaaahing\" about the steak.  He even declared it the best steak ever.  (2) Onion Rings - Excellent - Quantity: 2 onion rings.  Quality: The BEST ONION RINGS EVER!!  The skin was perfectly golden with a nice crunch yet light when you bite into it--with very little oily feel.  I hate fast food places, chains, mom & pops serve these onion rings that have hard crusts and extremely oily.  Flavor: You really can taste the onion goodness here--it isn't hidden by the batter.  So good.  Sprig of Greens - Excellent - Quantity: A sprig.  Quality: I'm amazed about the attention to detail here.  If you think this sprig of greens is just garnishment, think again.  They actually put dressing on these greens--meant for consumption, not looks.  Think of it as a mini, mini, mini salad.  Flavor: Great flavor--sweetness and citrus acidity pop from the dressing and refreshing flavor from the greens.  The greens actually refreshes your mouth after consuming such bold flavors from the beef.  French Fries - Excellent - Quantity: Approximately a 5 inch diameter bowl of fries--4 inches in height.  Quality: Nice golden brown color, perfectly crispy, and not oily.  Flavor: Tasted like good fries.  Seasoned well with a nutty flavor to them.  Let me check off my Las Vegas Checklist:  (1) Buffet - Nope - maybe Thursday morning (2) Gamble - Hell NO - I despise losing money (3) Club/Adult Entertainment/Events - Check - My Sac Kings lost to the Lakers.  Not going to make it rain this time. (4) Drink/Getting crazy loaded - Check - Gentleman Jack is your FRIEND. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fphoto%2FyZI0fAgC2XtddriDX2i3rA%2Fl&s=768ad423b9cf3e148663330f65b7055bd77b3909f835c51b4e97b202d91a8a18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media1.px.yelpcdn.com/ph...</a> (5) Late Hour Dining - Check - Grand Lux Cafe is \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"",

You are tired of walking from the Sands Convention center all the way to your room, so you stop here to rest and eat  The Grand Lux Cafe is a moderately priced, large and usually noisy restaurant at the hub of activity in the Venetian. It is between the room elevators, the escalators to the self-park parking garage, some shops, an information and ticket buying booth for shows, and the casino floor, and near the grand walkway to the lobby.  It has a large menu with something for everyone, with most entrees around $15 - $25.  Very much like the Cheesecake Factory, since this restaurant was designed by the creators of the Cheesecake Factory, that ubiquitous faux fine dining restaurant so popular with the suburban mall rat crowd.  Actually, I had a pretty good salmon entree here, well presented and not too expensive. The two Gin and Tonics helped my enjoyment.   Service is slower, though, but you should be able to find something reasonably tasty to satisfy your poor, tired soul here in the town that wasn't built on winners.  I forgot to see what Cheesecakes they offer here.",

So due to this, we decided to have breakfast at the Grand Lux.  The restaurant was fairly busy, but we didn't have any dramas in getting seated. The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff very helpful. Our waiter sort of leaned is towards the all you can eat breakfast buffet which we decided to agree to.  Let me tell you, the buffet breakfast was awesome. There is not much more I can say about it, except we will definitely come back here next time we are staying on the Las Vegas strip.",

The portions are huge I had to share with the sister and we couldn't even finish the food. Prices are reasonable. Menu selection is big a lot to choose from took awhile to look through. Waiter gave us time and ask if we had any questions about it.   Food: good in house bread with butter two kinds sourdough and oat bran.  Asian rib tacos very good cross of Asian and Mexican tacos. Tasty kick with sweet sauce.  Chili lime chicken mango salad so huge. It also had corn and avocado. Very tasty and refreshing.  I know what your thinking why are you ordering Mexican inspired foods at an American Rest. Food here is delicious. Shrimp scampi was delicious. The sauce was not sour just enough lemon kick. Shrimp was gently fried. Not to heavy.",

    "text": "Why two star? Bc of the food? No. Bc of the wait to get seated? No.  This was my 17th trip to Vegas and about my 8th eating but overall the worst service I've ever ever ever had in LV.  To preface the boring story, me and my girlfriend are the EASIEST people to wait on. We don't ask lots of questions, we start with please and end with thank you, and we never give the wait staff a hard time with anything, ever.  We ordered two iced teas, sliders, and mashed potato \"egg\" rolls. Hey, it's 1am. Anyways we get our drinks, ok. But he never comes back to refill them.... ever! We finished them before our meals. He brings the food and I guess it's my fault I didn't ask for more... the dry cups weren't a sign. Nonetheless he drops off the food and disappears into the night like a caped crusader. Meanwhile he waits on the table directly next to us. He 1. Didn't refill the drinks. 2. Asked if we needed condiments 3. Check back at all. 4. Didn't bring the bill or clear the plates until I nicely got his attention. He earned a $2.25 tip on a $30 check. I'd never ever ever tip under 18% ever ever but this guy was shit. I shouldn't have to ask for a refill. You bring my food, you see it's empty, and you refill it... like their been doing the last 200 years. You at least should check up on us once. You didn't. You suck. Do not pass go and do not collect 20%.  I blame the ass waiter not the restaurant. It's the first time I received poor service here.",

This location was right at the base of the elevators for the Venetian so it was the quickest and most casual place to get food.  The lines can be long at breakfast but we had no issues walking right in for lunch.   We loved the place so much that we ended up going twice during our short weekend trip.  Try the potato egg rolls, they were amazing!  Potatoes, cheese, chives, bacon, wrapped in a flaky egg roll pastry and served with sour cream.  To die for.   We split the beef wellington as we know the portions there are huge and it was amazing.  On our next visit, we tried one of their pastas and pizzas.  Skip the pizza but everything else we had there was extremely enjoyable.  This place reminded me a lot of the Cheesecake Factory in terms of decor/ambiance and menu variety & length.  They've got some stuff on the menu that isn't that great so make sure to google ahead of time some ideas of what to order and you'll leave satisfied.",

The waiter was cordial, gave great suggestions and constantly comes to check how we're doing. Great service.   We ordered the porkchop, asisn pear martini, New England clam chowder and asian nachos.  Umm...porkchop was very delish, meat was very tender; asian pear martini tastes  different and  delish, but the asian nachos was not that impressive, too sweet. If they put less sauce, maybe it might taste better.   The ambience was quite romantic and spacious.",

The salad was filling and helped me fulfill my self-imposed daily vegetable quota.  The steak and mashed potatoes, as a to-go up to my room after a day of crammed information into my head, was a comfortable way to end the day.  Just a hint, though, to management:  the chairs in the area where I waited for my to-go order are all those high bar-stool ones.  For someone like me who is a tad challenged with mobility, getting onto one of those chairs was impossible, so I stood around while waiting.  Other than that, cheers to this establishment!",

Avocado chipotle burger & fries were really good. Fries are addicting. Chicken & waffles also good. Waffle was light & fluffy yet crispy on the outside. Chicken had a great batter.

Normally I like ranch dressing but their house blend of oil was great.  The service was good (not great, but still good considering how busy they were.) and the prices were on par with any nice, sit down restaurant at a Las Vegas terse show.  The portions were large enough that two people could easily share it.  I highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe and try the Cobb Salad.",

    "text": "I really like this place.  It's owned by the same people who started Cheesecake Factory and while it feels similar, it doesn't at the same time.  The first time I came to this restaurant, I had never been to Cheesecake Factory.  I did not realize that they had humongo portions.  This was my first visit to Vegas and my first encounter with Grand Lux.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad to start, then I ordered a full entree (which I don't remember at all, probably because I barely ate any of it).  I had NO idea the ahi tuna salad was so huge.  It is a meal in itself.  Everything here is huge, but consistently tasty and fresh and on par with the cost of everything else in Vegas.  In retrospect, I am kind of wondering why the waiter/waitress who helped us didn't warn me that I was ordering *WAY* too much food?    My husband's favorite sandwich is the hamburger that is topped with bbq shortribs and fried onion strings (or something like that - it's a major meat fest).  Their menu is very eclectic with a vast array of choices (fish, meat, pasta, asian fusion, etc.), much like Cheesecake Factory - except they don't have advertisements scattered throughout it.  This last visit in June, we only made it to Grand Lux for brunch.  We shared a stack of dinner platter sized pancakes and shared an egg white omelette (filled with mushrooms, cheddar and ham) with toast and hash browns.  Yummy and definitely large enough for us to share.  This was the cheapest meal we had on our trip to Vegas (somewhere around $30 for two)  We also sat in the 'outside' area where you can do some serious people watching since you are right on the outskirts of the casino near the entrance towards the Sands convention center and the bank of elevators that takes you to the main hotel tower.   The interior is nice as well with roomy booths and regular tables.  Service is efficient and courteous.  Definitely no complaints.",

    "text": "I just noticed the previous review and felt inspired to inform: It's little known, but Grand Luxe Cafe actually started as a collaboration between the Venetian and the company that owns Cheesecake Factory, because at the time they were not allowed to open another CF on the Strip (this is what I've been reliably told).  Ironically, Grand Luxe took off and became one of the most, if not THE most successful restaurants in the original Venetian--which is why there are now two. And there's a big Grand Luxe in LA as well. And probably more elsewhere.  I haven't eaten here in a while, but I certainly believe this restaurant fulfills the phrase \"it is what it is\" better than anywhere.",

By far my favorite restaurant in vegas... i know there is no famous chef here, or the place is not named after a famous chef, but hey its 24 hours, the best bread on the strip and servings are huge!! IMO an upscale cheesecake factory... the fries are DELICIOUS... and those philly cheese egg rolls or something like that are pretty yummy as well!!  Definitely go here at least 2 times on all my visits to sin city! Wait is never too bad and prices are decent, much better than the overpriced restaurants in vegas, and i can come here in PJs!!",

The service is slow, and you may need to wait a while to get a table in this bustling joint (whose interior looks something like a scene from Alice and wonderland ... why do the booths look like mushrooms?), but I really love coming here the first night of a trip to Vegas.   First , you need to run all over the strip taking in every sight, drink, and game of chance that Vegas has to offer. After exhausting yourself thusly, head to the Grand Lux and order the Grand appetizer platter for the table (try to do this around 3 or 4 am). This is way too much food for two people, but it's affordable and tasty (I especially love the Asian inspired items on the plate).   While you wait the 45 minutes for your food to arrive, take in the sites: pretty and polished Venetian clientele dressed up and popping energy tablets with their wine (I think they're in from LA). Sitting here is reinvigorating! It makes you realize that you can stay up and play some more poker! You can drink five more $1 Miller Lights at O'Sheas! You can play two hands of Blackjack and double your money! But don't think you can win on those slot machines at the Venetian. You can't.",

Ive stayed at the Venetian for one of my most recent trips to Vegas for a week..and just about every meal I had was from the Grande Luxe!  What Ive had:  appetizers: Mini chili cheese hot dogs: hit the spot after a night of dancing and drinking at Tao, but dont u dare eat em if u cant hold down ur alcohol and food! Duck pot stickers: very yummy, dont really taste the duck meat due to the spicyness of the Hoisin sauce.  Asian Nachos: such a cool play off regualar nachos. the chips are made from wontons and there is peanut sauce which is spicy and sweet! there is also wasabi cream which is daring but sooo good. This appetizer is good with a beer!  Burgers: The Max Burger: Omfg!! burger effin heaven, I swear to you! Angus beef topped with short ribs, bacon, mushrooms and cheese! So delicious, I wanted to order another..but there was no way I was going to finish it!  Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich: Delicious, but nothing will top the Max Burger.   Entrees: Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: The presentation is so pretty, you dont want to eat it, but then your senses kick in and you start grubbin! With every bite of the tenderloin top off your fork with a little of the sweet mash potatos and mango salsa..your tongue will thank you! Fried Chicken: An overload of delicious chicken tenders!  Crispy Caramel Chicken: Spicy from the thai sauce, but there is caramel that blands down the kick of the spicyness and makes it a bit sweet.  Chicken Royale: if you want to play it safe, go ahead and pick this. simple and delicious.  Pizza:  Margherita: Yummy with a huge beer! The pizza bread is very thin and super crispy.  Simply put, the food is delicious. Be a risk taker and order something that sounds daring with the fusions of sauces, you wont regret it.  The presentation for all the plates are lovely.  Super Pro: Open 24 hours!!",

    "text": "It's in The Venetian Hotel and Casino, with which we are staying.  We've been here 2 days and ate here twice.  We got in late the first day and were looking for something reasonably priced that was convenient.  My wife had heard of it before as they have locations in other cities.  We live in Houston and there is one there.  We started with the Volcano Shrimp.  I believe they were supposed to be spicy, but were not in the least bit. That being said they were delicious.  They were fresh and perfectly battered.  They had an Aioli on the side which you didn't need, but complimented the flavors.  For dinner, I had braised pot roast with pan roasted carrots and broccolini.  The cut of pot roast was huge and tender.  It had a little fat, but not too much and it added extra flavor.  The gravy that came with it was awesome.  It comes with a creamy horse radish, but I asked for mine on the side.  I like to get the creamy mix and add a lot of the raw horse radish to the creamy mix to make it spicy.  My wife had the asian salad.  She said it was yummy and fresh.  For dessert we shared a strawberry cheesecake which was tasty.  The meal was about $60, before tip.  For breakfast the next morning I had sausage links, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and sourdough toast.  The sausage was great.  Everything else was standard as it is with hash browns and eggs. I took a pancake from my wife and it was delicious.  My wife got a ham, havarti, onion, and spinach omelette, with hash browns.  She said it was nicely seasoned and didn't need to add anything to it.  This means a lot coming from her.  As she is heavy handed with seasoning.  Many times I have seen her add salt before tasting.  I'll eat the same thing and think it is good without anything extra, while she is adding a fair amount of salt.  The meal was a shade under $50.  For being in The Venetian and on the strip it definitely is reasonably priced and worth the money.  They serve quality food.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.",

Sure it sounds like it's made-to-order, but really, at this volume of people they should already anticipate the demand.  I ordered the Caramel Banana Pecan French Toast, but requested the Caramel on the side. They forgot to do that, so it was drenched with extra sweetness. Also disappointing was the serving size. The french toast was so THICK that it was more like bread pudding in the center. What a waste of food, but great for my waist. The waitress offered to take it back but I didn't want to have to wait longer for edible food. And how were they going to correct it?  They were prompt to seat, and prompt for coffee and water refills.",

Both salads were large and very good. The seafood salad had ALOT of crab in it. The \"Louie\" dressing did have a strong lemon flavor. We enjoyed our meal and it was what we were looking for.

We can be at an Asian restaurant known only for their mooshoo pork, but if I see fish n' chips on the menu... i'm ordering it.   Grand Lux Cafe... you think: swanky, high class... maybe I should order a steak or the seared ahi tuna. NOPE.  I've strayed before and it was a big big mistake.  Crispy fried filets of fresh fish along with equally crispy and delicious fries.  To balance it all out there's a cup of fresh coleslaw with whole peanuts and a light asian inspired dressing (instead of the usual tart spoiled mayo taste).   The other great thing about this place is that they don't care how drunk or tired you are... they're letting you in, and they're letting you eat.  No rude service (even when I laid my head down on the table and slept for about an hour one night).",

Very clean and quick service too.   I always order the chicken pot pie. I always have to get this because it's really good! Lots of big chunks of chicken breast and veggies with a flaky pastry crust. There are also a variety of other things like pasta, burgers, salads, soups, sandwiches, etc. There's basically something for everyone. Portions here are huge, def. enough to share with someone.   Service here is great...esp the waiters at night. We had came back here after a night of drinking and the waiter was very patient with us and we were able to get some food in our tummys! Just a warning though, the late night menu is not the same full menu that they serve during the day time. Still plenty of delicious choices!",

And, I guess if you're going in a big group, there is a good variety on the menu. But I should have known to stick to simple things (like fries) because Grand Lux is from the makers of Cheesecake Factory (of which I'm not a huge fan).   I tried the Rustic Lasagna with Chicken. First of all, lasagna with chicken just sounds weird, but I thought, why not? It looked good when it came out, but it wasn't lasagna. It was cannelloni. Why not just call it what it is? It had the potential of being great -- meat, cheese (how can you go wrong with cheese?), spinach and mushroom. But, it lacked flavor!  Other dishes I sampled: Salmon Three Ways -- It was dry and salty. Crispy Sesame Tofu -- The tofu and snap peas were good, but the Szechuan orange sauce was pure salt. Also, I'm not sure where the \"crispy\" plays a role.",

Unfortunately for us, all the buffets were closed, so we wandered into the Venetian and found Grand Lux Cafe (I think a passerby recommended it to us, actually).  We walked in, and just like everything else in Vegas, were impressed by the splendor of the restaurant. We were promptly seated, and began to browse the menu.  I no longer remember the names of the dishes we ordered, but I'll put up the pictures of them. I personally got a salmon and eggs with onion dish. It was delicious. One of my friend's dishes took forever for it to come out, and the staff kept apologizing but said it was the chef's favorite dish. Indeed, it was really good, and worth the wait. Portions were definitely filling.  I had this drink with pineapple, mango, and passion fruit - my 3 favorite fruits! It was non-alcoholic, but SO GOOD. I'd highly recommend that one. =)  I don't remember exact pricing but do remember it being affordable. I'd definitely go here again. =)",

We ended up here out of convenience one hungover (shocking) afternoon.  Service was slow but the typically large menu is helpful for any particular cravings you might have.    There really is something for everyone.    We had to try the chili because it was made with short ribs and freakin' kobe ground beef.  Hard to pass up.  It was good but ridiculasly salty.   Also tried the patty melt on parmesan bread.   TOO greasy... even for a hangover... but if you like that sort of thing, get after it.    If you're looking for a really great meal this is not the place for you, but it is convenient and good for families or large groups.   Just don't come here expecting greatness or anything.",

Our server, Carlina, was EXCELLENT. They have an extensive menu so there is something there for everyone. The prices are extremely reasonable.  Nothing bad (hence the 3 stars), but everything else was just OK. I had the Spaghetti Carbonara and was really disappointed. I kept reminding myself that it wasn't an Italian restaurant and I shouldn't have great expectations. It was dry and greasy. The bacon was too crunchy and some of it burned. I prefer pancetta. I ate half of it and was done. My partner had the chicken tortilla soup. It was average. It seemed as if it was tomato based. Way to creamy.  Oh...there was one bad...The bread. It had no taste. It was too moist in the middle and I cut my gum with the crust. It seemed as if it had been warmed over a couple of times.  As I'm writing this...I'm thinking...try somewhere else before my next show there.",

The Grand Lux Cafe is a sister restaurant to the Cheesecake Factory so the food is good. It is on the heavier side but it is delicious.  Our first experience at the Grand Lux Cafe was absolutely wonderful due to our server. She made sure to fill our waters (we drink like camels) and even gave a \"dessert\" free of charge due to a birthday. She really made our dining experience an absolute joy.  Our second experience was not as great as our first due to our waitress. She did not fill our waters promptly and at times disappear. She was friendly but not very accommodating.  Overall, it is a good place to eat and depending on your server, a great experience to have.",

If you have a car, go to Black Bear diner....yeah, yeah, I know this is about Grand Lux, but the Venetian doesn't care about reviews, there are so many dumb schmucks there that will eat at their restaurant anyway.   The food could taste like fried a$$ and it would be still sell.  Luckily it doesn't.  The service is pretty good and quick.   The food came out hot, as ordered, and tasted great.  This is probably the 8th time I've eaten here and finally decided to Yelp.  I don't eat there cause it's the best, I eat there cause there isn't much else better in the Venetican and for some weird reason all my Vegas conferences are held either there or the Palazzo and ironically enough, both have a Grand Lux Cafe.     If you are on the company dime and short on time, go eat there. If not, go to the Black Bear Cafe..I think it's in Henderson or maybe Vegas proper.  I forget.  But they are a chain in CA and they are freaking the bomb!!!",

However, on this specific occasion, I decided to take my wife, mother-in-law, and baby daughter out for mother's day.  I have to admit that this was TRULY TRULY disappointing.  We arrived around 4:30pm and the place was not crowded (1/4 full).  Our server sporadically came to our table.  However, much of the time, she ignored us.  She only came when we had to WAVE her down or ask someone to attend to us.  This is a definite no no for this type of restaurant.  The franchise owner should be utterly embarrass!  If the service was bad, the food was downright awful.    My mother-in-law ordered the 3 way cooked Salmon.  She specifically stated not to overcooked the salmon.  Of course, it came out hard and not flaky.  My wife ordered the Kobe Meatballs.  It was dry and hard to eat.  You can tell that it was microwaved!  And, the third strike, I order my usual, Braised pot roast.  Usually, it is tender.  However, it was dry and inedible.  It was hard as a rock.  It looked like it was sitting out and someone decided to NUKE the dish.  It has been a while since I have ever done this at a restaurant, I actually had to ask them to redo the dish.  The second dish was better, but it was still bad.   With appetizers and drinks, the bill was over 100.  It was 100 too much for the service and type of food quality.  We were so upset after the meal.  In fact, there is no doubt that they have lost us as \"regular\" customers.  This is the last time that this customer will ever come here again.  Ugghhh!!",

They have good opening hours and it's a nice casual cafe to kick back and relax after a day of activities, gambling, drinking or an all nighter ...   However, because this is in the prime spot of Las Vegas i.e. Venetian and it's right by the entrance and one of the only cafes in Venetian serving this type of food, this place gets extremely packed, extremely fast! I came here for lunch at 11 am and it was already overly bustling with people, waiters and plates and forks everywhere. They have the hugest most extensive menu of any cafe I've seen yet and all of it comes out looking delicious and tastes so as well.  I had a chance to have a go at their breakfast menu and it's great, they do serve some breakfast items all day but also have a specialty breakfast portion until 11 am. Great place to stop by for some variety in Vegas that's casual and comforting aside from the terrible service.",

But my experience here may have changed my mind.   Both times we were lucky enough to be able to dine 'al fresco' - meaning a gorgeous view of the casino. But hey it still felt cool!  The first trip was a woozy breakfast after our first night out. We shared a bruschetta style breakfast dish and a couple of other egg dishes. I love that they serve real hash browns instead of home fries - so much more satisfying! The service was awesome, a cute little Asian man (I can say that because I'm Asian and he reminded me of my dad) who was totally attentive and fine with bringing us extra place settings and plates so that we could share.   The second trip was late at night after a trip to XS. This was an entirely different kind of meal, a ravenously hungry, get me some comfort food now before I fall asleep at the table kind of meal. One of my friends actually may have nodded off while waiting for our food. Again, we shared, this time the zen noodles, a yummy asian noodle soup with a lemongrass broth, and the pasta carbonara, THE BEST pasta carbonara I have ever had. The service again was commendable, considering it was about 2 in the morning and the place was filled with obnoxious patrons. The waiter was super nice and even reassured us when a loud alarm went off in the casino and we got nervous.   Perhaps my two favorite meals of the trip - a pleasant surprise!",

So we ventured to the one in the Venetian that is 24/7.  Valerie G. and I were craving some carbs, so we decided to share the \"Pasta With Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella\". I'm sooo glad we shared because the portion size is gigantic. We don't remember much (in fact it took about 10 minutes for us to correctly remember what we ordered) but what we do remember is that the pasta was amazing and totally hit the spot. Also the waitress was super nice and non-judging. Definitely a great (and possibly only) place to get some late night food especially after a night of BUR and pineapples...;)",

Well, I was disappointed in the flavors and technique as Vegas is supposed to known for culinary talent as well as night life. My crab crabs were fried extra crispy, leaving the crab meat dry. The spring rolls tasted odd until dipped in the sauce provided (I don't like my entire flavor to come from an added sauce) and they were not as crisp as I am accustomed. The pot pie filling was wonderful though. The crust a different story though, definitely flaky but dry as the surrounding desserts. I won't try this place again.",

Grand Lux was the closest restaurant, and thank the food gods it was-they have the best. burgers. EVER.  At one in the morning I had the mushroom burger, and it was amazing. Came back 16 hours later and had the mushroom burger again (this time with a salad instead of fries-aren't you proud of me?) Came back again the next night for dinner and had the bacon cheddar burger. Outstanding.   The fish tacos were also stellar, and my husband loved his avocado burger. Drinks were amazing too-I recommend the caramel apple and chocolate martinis. They are worth the splurge, trust me.  Menu is huge and would have loved to try their brunch, but couldn't make it a 4th time with our flight.   When I come back to Vegas, guess where I'll go?",

What we didn't know was just how big this restaurant is. We thought it was just the small seating area you could see from the shopping area. The hostess brought us behind that all to a much larger dining room with nice decorations. It was somewhat dimly lit which we enjoyed. The menu is one of the most extensive we have seen. We decided to get a bbq chicken pizza and the beef wellington medallions. Both were fantastic. The sauce with the medallions was amazing. It included mushrooms, which I don't really like, yet I wouldn't have even known they were there. It was a delight to get a good Las Vegas dinner for under $20 a plate. I would recommend it more for adults but there were plenty of families there.",

We've been told it's the sister company of The Cheesecake Factory, but we think it's better.  The portions are humungous and the prices are cheap.  THIS IS A BAD PLACE FOR A DIET!  We were in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving and ate here the on Thanksgiving Eve.  Like The Cheesecake Factory, they have a large variety of items on the menu and they are all good.  The chicken parmesan comes on a platter large enough to feed 3 or 4 people!  In short the appetizers are huge, the salads are huge and the entree's are HUGE!  For us and more importantly is that the food is very tasty.  We love this place and I would rate it a 5 just on value.  However, the downside is that wait times can be long and the smell of cigarette smoke flows in from the casino floor just outside quite heavily at times.  Tip:  Ask for a table well inside the restaurant.",

The menu was so vast that there is something for everyone. I ended up coming here for three meals during my week long stay in Vegas.   I had a Grand Lux Omlette for breakfast, which came with asparagus, Artichoke, Oven-Dried Tomato, Portabella Mushrooms and Havarti Cheese. I asked for the hollondaise sauce on the side.  Also came with choice of hashbrowns or tomatoe/lettuce and choice of bread. I went for the tomatoe/lettuce and an english muffin.  It tasted perfect!  If you like cream cheese, ask for some because they make it fresh and boy it is gooooood!  As for the other two meals, I had the the Manhattan salad for dinner. The portion was huge, I had to take half of it to go.  It was a chopped salad with Romaine Lettuce, Asparagus, Tomato, White Beans, Fresh Beets, Red Onion, Peas, Lentils and Assorted Vegetables tossed in Our House Vinaigrette with chopped fresh turkey and cheese. I loved it!!! The other meal was the sonoma salad which didn't stand up to the Manhattan.    Meals cost between 10-20 bucks.  They have great lunch specials that are really dinner sized portions.    You can't go wrong at the Grand Lux. It's located centrally inside the Venetian and open late.  Service was great each time!",

I would also give their omelet with havarti a gold star.  I've heard good things about their weekend breakfast buffet, including the omelet bar.  I shall try it next time I'm in Vegas!",

It had been raided and it was a bit of a mess. The food, especially the sausage, was tasty so ignoring the mess at the buffet it was a good experience. We told the waiter about the lack of food at the buffet, and she was largely ignorant. Not the service I expect at a place that charge you $20 for brunch.",

    "text": "Whoa. Yelped something for some late night grubbery and this place popped up on Yelp.  There are two locations.  One at the Venetian and one at the Palazzo.  In essence, they're right next to each other.  Ordered some appetizers.  NOTE!  One appetizer is as big as a meal.  The calamari was just nicely breaded and had a nice bite to them.  The two sauces the calamari comes with is good!  Also got the chicken quesadillas.  This is not your typical chicken quesadilla.  You are probably imaging a flour tortilla and some diced up chicken breast and some cheese.  Not this.  It had three layers.  Some shredded chicken with a nice kick to it.  Some green chiles and cheese.  My only gripe was that we got sat near the entrance and I had to flag our waitress down every single time.  One for water.  One to get our orders taken.  Another to ask for some condiments.  Another for our check.  She was more interested in helping the table of 10 obnoxious guys next to us.  All the other tables seemed to be tended to.  It is what it is.",

I did have to send the fries back because they were just a little warm and my fries have to be hot!! The service was a little slow but the servers were nicer do offered bread while we waited! Yummy!!!! I also got the spicy Thai chicken with veggies and white rice. I would definitely order this again but with light sauce. They use all white chicken breast for their chicken plates. My husband always gets the chipotle burger and he is one happy camper. They are addy with the Cheesecake Factory so the prices are about the same but way better food!!!",

I ordered the pan seared salmon and it was great! My boyfriend ordered the chopped beef steak - didn't like it at all, and wanted to the angus steak. Ashley was kind enough to switch it out for us , and offered salad or soup while he waited!   She was great on our refills, and was very sweet. Overall great food, greatttt service, (thanks Ashley!) and wonderful atmosphere! We will be back!",

Yes, it's a Cheesecake Factory spinoff, but lunch is rarely more than $15 per head, and if you can find a better deal, please tell me because I think this place is a bargain.  If you're in a hurry, you can eat at the bar - they serve the full menu and you always get great service since the bartender is never more than a few steps away from you.    The Venetian is too fancy for a buffet, so this is the only buffet you'll find in the entire hotel, and it's breakfast only.  It has a pretty nice variety of small muffins, bear claws, croissants, English muffins/bagels/toast, bacon, potatoes and a made-to-order omelet station.  The line can be pretty long, but those guys work pretty quickly.  Lots of the entrees come in a smaller lunch portion, and the service is always fantastic with drinks frequently refilled and servers coming to check on you.  I've never had a bad meal here, and when you consider how much food this kitchen turns out, I think they are pretty much hitting home runs every night.",

Luckily there are great places like Grand Lux Cafe that will spare you some time.  There is one inside The Pallazo and another inside The Venetian.    The first time I came to Grand Lux I had one of their chicken sandwiches with fries, about $13.  Its fairly big and pacts quite a punch.  I was stuffed for hours and even had to nap shortly after.  This last time I tried the burger melt, about $13.50, which also comes with fries.    The burger melt oozed from side to side with hot melted cheese and thousand island.  Every bite tasted just, if not better, than the last.  I highly recommend the burger melt if you're interested in a burger.  I got mine medium rare and it was delicious.   Service was pretty fast and efficient.  This will have to be a must for me next time I'm in Vegas",

It was very crowded on a Monday afternoon but there is ample seating at tables or booths so I was seated right away. There are plenty of friendly and competent servers to make the meal time pleasant. Now the menu can be a bit overwhelming with all its choices so don't feel like you have to chose the very first item that catches your eye. Make sure to read the menu carefully. My mai tai ended up costing more than my soup, salad, 1/2 sandwich combo cost, but it was a GIANT drink. My only gripe about GLC is that they always seem to have it so dark in there!

It took almost 30 mins for us to wait for only 3 dishes and during the waiting time, the waiter didn't come and didn't give us bread, though I saw other tables had the bread. Also after we finished, I asked for a box to pack up the food. The waiter just gave me the box and asked me to do it by myself, though I saw on the other table, the waitress helped those guests to pack the food. I am not saying I can't do it by myself, but since it supposed to be a good restaurant, I feel being disrespect.",

We would drive in at 11pm and head straight over for a great late dinner. We love the service here, although the last time I was here they sat us in the patio... wrong move. It's in the casino so, smokers keep walking by and it's more noisy. No patio seating unless you want to people watch and don't mind the smoke. If you're there for Brunch get the Blood Orange Mimosa, Peach Bellini,  and the Brioche French Toast with strawberries... YUMMY!! We love the Chicken Enchiladas and The Crispy Carmel Chicken is my hands down favorite although, it doesn't taste anything like Carmel. Sweet & spicy crispy chicken would be a better name. The Pasta with Chicken, Sun-dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms is also very good.",

I've always ordered the pot roast in here but thie time it was dry and pretty much burnt.I sent it back and they admitted they were having \"issues\" with it.The salad I ordered in it's place had  soggy tomatoes that just ruined it.  The others in my party were not impressed with their food either.The worst part is we specificly went to the Venitian to eat there on my recomendation and nobody left happy.  The manager did come out and  try to smooth things over but the bad taste was already in our mouths!  Also while seated in the bar in a low booth we had a birds eye view of a overweight 40 ish woman in booty shorts,whose legs were spead eagle at  one the high tables across from us.When she wasnt showing everyone her goods she was rubbing her companions crotch with her bare foot! If I'd of been able to actually eat my food ,I'd of probably of thrown up!  I wish I could still love this place but I can't anymore.",

    "text": "5 stars all around! This place has everything you would want in a meal, taste, quality, quantity and price.  I see that many have mentioned that the food is like Cheesecake Factory but i think this place is much better and the portion size is ridiculous. Every entree can be shared between two people comfortably and the best part? The price is just right.   Came in here with a group of 6 on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM and was seated within 5 minutes. Next came the complimentary bread- omg, probably some of the best sourdough bread i've ever had. The bread was warm, the inside was soft and the outside had just enough of chewiness and crunch. Our group ordered the lettuce wrap, the pizza, the salmon and chicken terriyaki, the fettucini alfredo and another pasta dish. Eveyrthing was delicious and none of us spent more than $15 dollars each(with tax and tip already) - not to mention we all had leftovers for after-clubbing grub at 4 AM.   To top it off, the service was awesome. Our waiter was honest with us about the portion sizes and encouraged us to share- not like the typical waiters that roll their eyes when they know you are sharing. He also offered to split all of the checks for us and even went above and beyond to split the shared items among the pairs. There was a 18% gratuity charge on our check but almost all of us left him extra tip because he was so awesome!!!!   Thanks Grand Lux Cafe for a great meal!!! I'll definitely be back.   Oh, they are also open 24 hours i believe :)",

After partying upstairs at TAO, the girls and I went back to our room, changed into our pajamas and then went downstairs to soak up the alcohol that was surely seeping from our pores.  I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles and starved as I was, it was enough for me and one other girl to share. I'm not sure if it was due to the fact that I was so hungry I could've eaten a horse, but the chicken was extra cripsy, not greasy or gross and the waffles tasted fab (Did I detect a hint of cinnamon?).    I've since had the Bacon Cheeseburger and Fettucino Alfredo, both were absolutely amazing and the servings out of control.  I'd recommend sharing a meal if you go.  It also stated that the atmosphere is dress but multiple times I have been here at 4am dressed in my pajamas and no one has said anything.",

I come here for 3 main reasons: The buffalo chicken rolls are perfection, it's open 24 hours, and I like to sit in the patio area so I can watch stupid drunk people passing by.   As much as I enjoy coming here I think giving it anything more than a 3 or 3.5 would be generous. Their fries are always dissapointing and the rest of the food is okay. For me, its main charm is the fact that it's open 24 hours and it's in my favorite hotel to stay at.  The buffal chicken rolls are reason enough to come check this place out.",

If you haven't heard , Grand Lux is a chain with Cheesecake factory. I love cheesecake factory, so I already knew that it was going to be bomby food. So I came here when it was really late which means that I couldn't order anything. There is a special menu area for late night guests and i guess special seating? I ordered the pasta with sun dried tomatoes basil and chicken. Freaking delicious, yes. Weird down side to this place, was that the floors were extremely slippery, I had to ice skate myself around. And the way they seated us was so weird because we were sitting so close to the people next to us, that we can hear each other's awkward conversations.  BUt I guess that is something you only see in Vegas. Come here!!!!!",

I ran into a girl in the bathroom that had leftovers from this restaurant that said it was cheap, pretty good and had BIG PORTIONS... and was just around the corner.  Sweet!  It was kinda like eating at Cheesecake Factory.  Which makes sense, since it's owned by them.  The food was nothing special - pretty good, and we all finished our apps (buffalo chicken rolls), entrees (patty melt, ahi tuna burger, chicken salad sandwich) & a dessert (apple pie) without blinking.  BTW, when I ask for my ahi tuna burger to be cooked raw, I don't expect to receive an ahi tuna burger that is medium well.  But I was so hungry that by the time I realized I should've said something, it was nearly all gone.  It was still pretty tasty though.  So... yes, we'd all eat here again. Especially if we were drunk or hungover.",

The fruit is fresh and nicely cut. You have a toast area that has many bread choices as well as bagels and English muffins. The only downside is there was no cream cheese for the bagels. The hot area had an omelet to order area as well as excellent waffles ready to eat, very nicely done scrambled eggs, which is rare in general, and by far some of the best bacon I've had ever. There was also ham, sausage and hash-browns as well. The price also included a beverage. My friend got the huevos rancheros which I tasted and they truly were amazing.

Since I knew it was owned by the Cheesecake Factory, I kind of had an idea of what I could expect.  There was a little bit of a wait, but it didn't take too long to get seated.  There seemed to be a lot of empty tables, so I'm surprised it took as long as it did, but no biggie. I had the Wild Mushroom \"Burger,\" one of their vegetarian options. It was surprisingly delicious, and the fries were good too. My lunch buddies ordered the lunch-sized salads, which they really enjoyed, and were still very generous in size. On the way out, I passed by a table that had ordered some kind of pasta, and the portion size was enormous.  There was something a little cheesy or forced about the waitstaff ... but no more cheesy than everything else in Vegas, I suppose.  Overall, a decent place to stop and grab lunch for a reasonable price.",

I just finished having lunch with a gf who loves Grand Lux and is in from out of town, so politely agreed to join at Palazzo. I ordered something different from the Asian Nachos which is the only thing that I have had there that I thought was extra good at one time, but the last time I got them thought they had gone downhill, so decided to switch today to the Rachel (sister to a Ruben). The meat was so greasy and bad tasting that I literally had to pull it from the sandwich and eat the slaw and bread alone which too was overly greased and dripping. I stopped eating at about half because I thought it would make my stomach upset if I ate more. Trust me, I don't usually walk away from a Ruben sandwich. With so many great places to eat in Vegas why bother?",

Bad customer service = hostess with a bad attitude, a table without basic condiments such as sugar for coffee, waffles delivered on a plate without any strawberries or whip cream  Food on the other hand was delicious. I had the avocado chipotle burger. Burger was cooked to perfection, tasted gourmet fresh. Avocado portions were fair, fries on the side and you are golden! For lunch, my friend had the chilaquiles (delicious, but light on the eggs) and strawberry waffles  Better than Cheesecake Factory!",

    "text": "Ok, people.  Let's give a lill' credit where credit is deserved.  Grand Lux Cafe holds a special place in my heart.  Let me break it down for y'all,...  - Yeah, Grand Lux Cafe's evil twin sister restaurant is The Cheesecake Factory.  But, what this means for you, gentle reader, is a hearty, \"American-sized\" meal.  You won't go hungry here. - Not only are the portions generous, the food is DANG GOOD.  It might be reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory, or even Mimi's Cafe.  But, it's consistently good.  REALLY good.  Comfort foods galore. - And, good comfort food is even better after a hard night of hardcore partying.  For all your alcoholics out there (particularly from California), don't front - you know y'all head to Denny's or Jack In The Crack or Mel's because really junky, greasy food tastes even better at 3am and when you're trying to sober up.  Well, the food at Grand Lux Cafe is several notches above Denny's, Mel's and Jack In The Crack.  AND, this place is open 24:7.  Even better.  You can stumble into the restaurant looking like a complete train wreck, missing one shoe and tiara in hand, at 3am, 5am or 7am!  And the yummy comfort food at Grand Lux Cafe will be waiting for you like a faithful, faithful friend.",

Plus, when they did seat us, the floor was incredibly slippery and even the guys in their flat rubber bottomed soles were sliding.  Real safe.  The food was okay, although I think my salad gave me a serious case of the runs later on (my friend had the same salad and felt sick the next day).   Our waiter was great, though, and she did a good job with our large table.  Drinks were watered down, which also sucked.",

I believe this place is open 24 hours so you can come here anytime to satisfy your late night cravings. They have a huge menu, but it's heavy on the selection of pastas. I got the pasta carbonara if I remember correctly. It was good, but heavy on the cream, which might not have been the best idea, but I was too hungry to care at the time. The portions are huge and I could barely finish half. It was not that good the next day to say the least. The butter cream had solidified into a chunky rock-like state. I also tried the chicken and waffles, which was also good. The service here was very good as our waiter was helpful in suggesting my pasta plate. I guess it never hurts to be nice when your restaurant is located in a casino and you just hope you run into a lucky patron who is feeling generous. Unfortunately, I had just lost all my money a few moments earlier.",

    "text": "If there's a book on how to run a large restaurant efficiently, serve decent food in a nice atmosphere, and get the orders right, then these folks wrote that book. Even though it's a large establishment inside a casino, the waiters don't treat you like you're a tourist at Disneyland.  There are, in fact, multiple Grand Lux cafes, with identical menus -- one  inside the Venetian and one at the Palazzo (the two casinos are seamlessly connected). And there's also a mini G.L. serving coffee and pastry.  This is a great option when you're looking for reliably good food served quickly -- but not in the mood for a) the food court, or b) a high-dollar, celebrity-chef inspired, fine-dining \"experience\". I ate at Grand Lux twice this weekend (once at V and once at the Palazzo), and the service was exceptional. For breakfast I had the best French toast I've tasted in a long time -- not too soft, gooey, or sweet (made with Brioche). (I rarely go out for breakfast, but for this place I'll make an exception; so many places seem compromised at breakfast, like everything is being done by the B team, which I suspect it probably is.) At lunch, I had the chicken enchiladas (available in two portion sizes -- the lunch consists of two smallish enchiladas, plenty of food unless you are really hungry). The sauces were spicy and flavorful -- a nice dish and only about $11. Hubby had the appetizer-portion Greek salad, also good, and quite substantial. We had a side of fries, and they were good.   The staff made sure our water glasses were filled, not making us feel rushed, and the time we spent there was exactly right (they keep the music up *really* loud to keep those tables turned... but in a nice way). Compared to the iffy service and cramped quarters at the Tintoretto bakery / cafe near the Grand Canal Shops, this place is a Godsend.",

FOR FREE! yes that's right i said FREE. i received enough free breakfast coupons at check in from the front desk for all 4 of us in my group to eat here every morning we stayed at the venetian for 5 days. this one is locatred on the first floor right by the phantom of opera theatre. we came here twice for breakfast (wasted the other coupons, sigh) and had the continental breakfast (valued at $8 per person on our bill but was $0 for us). it came with a drink selection and a small fruit dish with 3 assorted pastries that changed based on the day you came. the coupon also gave me an option of eating the buffet breakfast which would have been $10 a person with the coupon. the lines are never longer than a 10-15min wait although it may look like a super long wait, but that's also because i was here off season in december before the holidays. i think they have a line separate for grazie members although i didnt discover that til after eating there. (free to join). we just left tip based on the value of the breakfast. cheapest/best way to eat breakfast in vegas!",

Both times I had a really good service and the wait time was appropriate to my needs.   The food was good, better than your average American chain, and the portions were very big for the price. This is Vegas so I expected a 6$ tempura green beans appetizer to be really small and it turned out to be enormous, enough for 4ppl. My carbonara pasta plate was basically 3 meals (was huge but really good, with al dente pastas). We left with to-go boxes as it turned out to be too much food, but it was good enough to bring back to room. They also serve side bread and give you unlimited soda once you order one.  Would go back when plans with friends are not clear and you didn't reserve or when you don't want to go far from the hotel. Also perfect go to restaurant late at night or hungover!",

    "text": "Great food, short wait time, friendly service, comfortable setting, and HUGE portions.  'Twas an early Saturday evening in Vegas. Dinner time. Four hungry people each craving something different. Where to go? Oh yeah, and good luck getting a table at this time of day, right?  Well, we were in luck. We saw the Grand Lux Cafe. After checking out the menu we were relieved to see that the menu was so diverse. There really is something for everyone. It seems to cater to the myriad of diverse pallets wandering through the hotel at any given time. There is a link to their \"Full Menu\" on the right side of this page. Guess what?--that ain't their full menu. That is a teaser. The best part was that despite what looked like a large volume of people waiting for a table the hostess ensured us that it would only be a 5 minute wait. (And it was).  They have everything from burgers and steaks to pastas, pizza and seafood as well as a large selections of salads. There's nothing exotic here, mind you, it's all standard North American fare. If you're a food blogger looking to write about your latest culinary conquest you might be a little sad.  I got the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. It was served in a large dish and as mentioned earlier, portions were generous. Not bad for $16--ish.  A special mention should be made of our friendly and outgoing server. We never did get her name unfortunately. It's always great to receive amazing service that's equal to the delicious food you're getting.  My only gripe is that we were seated next to the area where customers wait for a table to open up. The dining and waiting areas are separated by wrought iron fence. The people waiting have tendency to lean on the fence, sticking their fingers through it and talking loudly amongst themselves with no respect for the people eating on the other side of it. Their was even a child trying to climb the fence at one point. If the staff try and seat you in this area I would suggest that you just wait for a table to open further inside the restaurant.",

I think it was a total of about 30 of us? So taking our orders and getting the checks to us at the end were a little insane, though our servers were good-humored and managed us well.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Creamy Spinach & Cheese Dip, Chicken Pot Pie, and the Baked Rigatoni. MISTAKES. We definitely could've gotten away with ordering just the appetizer and an entree... or even a single entree between the two of us. Portions are huge.  That being said, the food itself was pretty good. The spinach dip came at a great time since we were starving. I loved the rigatoni, though my boyfriend thought it was a bit too salty for his own taste.  If I could redo this experience, I would order less and save myself room for dessert. I would've loved to try their beignets or molten chocolate cake.",

We were just there this weekend for a family reunion with my brothers from out of town. We ordered the wings and unfortunately all 3 of us bit into undercooked wings. We informed our waiter, as he is taking them back he talks to the manager? I believe. Well he came over and felt he needed to explain the wings were *not* undercooked but because the wings are so large the veins look bloody because it is difficult to cook them all the way due to their size? I'm sorry but I've eaten wings at many places, much larger wings and I have not encountered this problem. They were not veins. They were BLOODY. He stated he could cook another order but would come out the same. I felt that he could have made an effort to maybe cook them all the way? Idk maybe it's just me but I would want to make my customers happy and not go back to *try to explain why wings are raw. Very displeased with service, will not be returning.",

The Lemon Chicken Piccata ordered from the lunch menu was very flavorful (cheaper price due to lunch specials from 11am til 5pm); however, while the chicken was tender and excellent, the sauce was heavy and anywhere the sauce wasn't touching the pasta was slightly hard, thus obviously had been sitting under the warming light for a few.  The service, while good, was not up to par for the price we paid.    However, I feel this restaurant provides a huge number of options that could please everyone.  If you were to go at prime time meal service (instead of 3:30pm), I imagine the food and service would be spot on.",

This restaurant is open 24 hours so it's convenient for after-party grub! I heard that it's the same owners as the Cheesecake Factory and you'll see a few similarities.  Their chicken and waffles $13.95 are amazing!!! The waffle is very fluffy on the inside and the exterior has a slight crisp to it! I LOVED IT! They also pile on chicken strips.  I love that they serve bread and butter with the meal too! Bread and butter makes the restaurant so much better I think ha ha  Our server Ahmat?( I think that's his name) was very attentive! He was great! When we asked for to-go boxes he even went out of his way to pack syrups for us without us having to ask! He was awesome!  Definitely make this your stop after a long night of clubbing or gambling! It's way better than the fast food options!",

You will wait and wait and wait for service. The servers make you feel like you are at Denny's (actually I have had much better service at Denny's). We were there for a late morning breakfast and it was boring and bland. The place is loud and at least for me in the morning I would like just a little quiet. You would be better served at The Paris Buffet or the Buffet at the Belligo.  It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive (you want more coffee--think again) and it was cold. I love Las Vegas and I love the places to eat there, from the cheap buffets at some of the smaller hotels to the hot dogs in Downtown Las Vegas to the expensive dinner houses in the hotels. This place fits into none of these categories.  Grab something else to eat, anywhere, and save your money for a great dinner house.  Any Buffet is better. Anyone. This is just bad.",

Open 24 hours like most Las Vegas casino cafes, this place offers all of the convenience of other cafes with an amazing and gourmet selection, outstanding service, and good value (compared to other places on the Strip). We have tried just about everything on the menu and NEVER have had a bad experience. The wait staff is always exceptionally helpful and professional, and the food cannot be matched!  MUST HAVE: Asian nachos off of their Appetizer menu. It comes on a gigantic platter so don't be fooled by the \"Appetizer\" label. My brother ONLY gets this every time we go and it is his favorite!  Also, their dessert menu consists of different cheesecakes straight from The Cheesecake Factory, among other scrumptious items. Save room for dessert!  There really are no bad items on the menu so try whatever looks good and you won't be disappointed!",

Choice of the usual breakfast meat, waffle, scramble egg, omelet, pastry, toast juices and fruits. On the meat side, bottomless bacon and sausages are perfect!

The menu is extensive, although not as scary as a Cheesecake Factory menu, and the portions are big.  The breakfast items are a good deal, came with 3 eggs, hash browns, meats.  But there are also other things like noodles to sandwiches.   Service wasn't great my first morning, the waitress seemed a bit confused and wasn't attentive to our table.  Food also took a little while to come out and one of our orders came out wrong.  Even when we were switched to a new waiter things didn't quite improve.  On the second morning had a much better waitress and food came out a bit quicker.  Probably shouldn't expect too much at this time of day.    I don't think there is anything mind blowing on the menu, but it's decent grub when you need some food and they're open.  Variety on the menu let's you choose if you want breakfast/lunch/dinner.  Portions are good, price is medium.  It's definitely a decent option depending on what time of day it is and where you're staying.",

We wanted to start off with an appetizer and went ahead and ordered the  Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll.  it came out hot, and was pretty guud.  however for the 8 bucks, i do not think it was totally worth it.  you get about 8 small pieces of just hot potatoes stuffed inside egg rolls.  meh.     We also ordered the Salmon with brown rice and the Pulled pork with side salad.  Both dishes were good.  The salmon dish was creamy and there were sizable chunks of salmon in there. as for the pulled pork, from what i remember it was delicious.  i think the bread was a bit hard, but whateverz.   the server was nice and super attentive.  you'll see a lot of drunk peeps here past midnight.  lol.  make sure to give everyone high fives, since strangers love that.",

I had trout with a side of sauteed mushroom and sauteed spinach. So yummy! Wish they have this in NYC! Definitely stop by. It's inside the Venetian Casino.",

As far as the order the butternut squash cream soup was good the main course dishes were  barely warm  not hot at all and cooled fast. Definitely will re consider which location to visit next time.",

It was in-between lunch and dinner so we thought the Grand Lux would be suitable for this. It met our needs perfectly. The waiter was cool with our plans and made sure to recommend some great desserts for our sweet teeth.   I got the molten lava cake which is a chocoholics dream. The vanilla ice cream is necessary to cut through the richness of the chocolate. The apple pie my friend got was more like an apple tart which she ended up liking better than if it was in traditional pie form. Since our group was from New Orleans we got a kick out of seeing beignets on the menu so of course we had to order some. About half of us thought the beignets were pretty decent, but not to be compared to a New Orleans beignet which are not as doughy and never served with sauces. That being said, their version of it was still pretty good so we aren't knocking them. The coffee was also good and strong which was the perfect pick me up we all needed.   Our server was cool and probably one of the more friendly servers we had in Vegas.",

    "text": "SUMMARY: Uninspiring cafe located in the midst of the frenzy of casinos in the Venetian. Food was terrible and expensive. I can't believe this is part of the Cheesecake Factory franchise -- their quality has really declined through the years. The servers seemed friendly but really wish one of them would have warned us to STAY AWAY from this place.   Rumour has it the Cafe on the Palazzo side is better. I have no idea. Play it safe and don't approach this franchise.  VERDICT: I would not return here, and I would not recommend eating here during your time in Vegas.   ITEMS ORDERED: (1) Turkey BLT with sweet potato fries -- my mom ordered this and liked the fries. However, the sandwich itself was not good. Cold wet turkey on some untoasted OLD bread in a sandwich that fell apart upon first bite. Dry, tasteless, and was about $14... are you kidding? (2) Margherita pizza -- ha ha HA... this is not a pizza. It was thin, wet (???), and tasteless. Remember those rectangular pizzas they served you in grade school? Imagine flattening it to about half a milimetre thick and then popping it quickly in your toaster oven to give it a \"crisp\". It was bad and I finished eating it out of the sheet guilt of not paying for my meal.  (3) Breakfast sandwich -- my sister ordered this. It seemed okay and she didn't complain about it. But honestly, I think I've said all I wanted to say and would recommend you to steer clear of this place.",

    "text": "Grand Lux has been a staple at the Venetian (and Palazzo) forever. Owned by Cheesecake Factory, their menu is quite expansive and nearly everything here is satisfying.   For me, this place has a little bit of built in nostalgia. My wife and I used to sneak here when we were dating (and she was my boss...well, she still is the boss). Usually we'd hit up Grand Lux around 1am for some late night eats.  Nowadays things are a little different. We're a party of 3, and Grand Lux is great since it's a super family friendly spot and loud enough that if a meltdown does ensue, the entire restaurant doesn't turn around to look at you. Fortunately, on our most recent visit the little man was on his best behavior. We ordered the kids Grilled Cheese and were shocked with how large it was. UUUUUGE. Enough for two kiddo's to share. AND, it was really, really good. My long standing staple item is the Santa Barbara chicken sandwich. Grilled chicken, pepper jack cheese, and avocado on a hamburger bun. So good. Side dishes are decent. I got a house salad, which came with a vinaigrette. It was so-so.   Pricing, given the location on the strip, is really reasonable. $13-16 for most sandwiches. Pasta dishes & entrees a tad more expensive. Given the location, quality of food and service (very good), I definitely think Grand Lux is one of the better values on the strip.",

    "text": "I was honestly extremely disappointed with my negative experience at this restaurant. We arrived with a large group of 15 and were quoted a 45 minute wait time. After a large wait time, we were seated only to hear that they were out of many of their items, including (but not limited to) many of their seafood dishes, meat dishes, Alfredo sauce, etc. This is something a restaurant should let you know of before you wait a full hour to be seated. Reluctantly, we ordered different food than we initially wanted. They brought a Caesar salad for us earlier and although it tasted good, it came served three pieces of lettuce with some breadcrumbs on it. I don't understand why you are allowed to pay $15 for a salad that comes that you have to chop yourself. My husband sat there chopping the salad with a butter knife because they didn't even have good enough service so that we could ask for a better knife. After 30 minutes of waiting, our waiter comes to tell us she made a mistake about the ingredients in one of our dishes (it had pork even though we stated we had religious restrictions that would stop us from eating pork) and they ran out of the Mahi Mahi that was in FIVE of our foods. Essentially, 5 people couldn't get their food anymore. I genuinely don't understand why they waited 30 minutes in to tell us that they ran out of one of the main things we ordered. Even though they have a sister restaurant in the next hotel over which is literally a five minute walk they weren't willing to accommodate us and bring food from over there so we had to end up getting up and leaving after a night of starvation. The manager was not helpful at all and we ended up being so disappointed.   We will never return to this place. Such a disappointment considering everything we've heard about grand lux.",

Everything was tasty minus the potatoes. I personally feel like the dish doesn't need the potatoes, I mean they weren't even seasoned which blows. But anywho, the sausage gravy was very hearty and tasty. My fiance had the french toast which is enough food for two people and he didn't like it at all.....bummer. I wouldn't mind trying this place out again, without him of course because he's just gonna watch me eat and that's no fun.",

Adequate on other food items. Painless to place your order and pay and be out of the door.  Atmosphere is large, expansive what you expect on the Strip in a large casino.

It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad considering it was extremely packed. It took awhile for our food to arrive, so this may not be the place to dine if you are in a hurry to get somewhere.  We saw how large the portions were, so my friend and I shared the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. The grilled chicken wasn't dry at all. I was surprised at how juicy it was considering it was white meat! I couldn't finish even though we shared. Definitely kept me full the rest of the night.  Yelp reviews said this was the sister restaurant of The Cheesecake Factory, so we kept comparing the two. I think I like this one better! We saw the next table's Shrimp Scampi and that looked absolutely delicious! Dine here if you want good quality and portions for the price!",

    "text": "Terrible I don't know if it was a race thing or what but first my sister points to jambalaya on the dinner menu the server asked did u want lunch or dinner portion. My sister asked her if it was the same. The server continued with it's the same thing just smaller portion. It came out and was only chicken and my sister asked where was the shrimp. The server Susan R said u didn't specify chicken or shrimp. My sister isn't confrontational so she didn't say much. But said she was never asked before on chicken or shrimp because it is Cajun chicken and shrimp jambalaya. So the server tells her she will make another one. The the manger comes over and ask what happen? My sister proceeds to tell where the disruption in communication could have happened and the manager walks away before she even finishes like she wasn't interested in the story, but does say well They rushed to bring a new one.  We orders cookies the lady said they take 30 minutes. They came out hard and cold mine were slightly warm but hard . The manager explained that the cookies come out that way and they let them sit to cool down. Some were burnt. So your telling me you send out slightly burnt cold cookies? I continued to tell her how I was here I was here on the 1st and had better service better cookies and she dismissed it and started walking away before my sister could ask for another. We didn't even get bread to the table until we asked for it and it came with food. I've been looking around watching people get bread right away and Susan Has continued to check on them and we weren't getting that same service we got half her attention because she didn't even care to bring bread or explain that the dinner and lunch portions are different entirely. I won't be coming back here. This is located on the strip there should be better service.  I asked the manager if the difference in the service was based on race and she immediately shut me down. She said no. Yet myself and I are the only ones of a different race not being treated the same. No one asked if we needed boxes, how the food was, if we needed anything else. It was like pulling teeth. We present with a clean appearance. We have manners. Went to college. There is nothing outward that is different than our skin colors but we were served after people that arrived after us. We are still sitting here writing this review while other people have come and gone and we are still waiting on the server to bring back the check.  This is horrible customer service.",

After making a few drinks, and again without saying a single word, Lina tosses two plates in front of us. So I asked to speak to a manager. Her response was, \"Sure\" and she goes back to making drinks. So I stood up and walked to find a manager myself. The manager asked if I wanted to be moved to a table instead, I said no because my husband wanted to watch the game, which is why we sat at the bar from the beginning. He went over to speak to Lina, but after he left, she still remained unpleasant. We merely came to have dinner and watch the game, not to be irritant Lina. Very disappointed in my dining experience.",

I have to work in Las Vegas quite often and I don't have to tell you that if you eat on the \"Strip\" or anywhere close by, you're gonna get financially gouged, whether the food and service were good or not. Not here!   There is no doubt that I go out of my way to eat off the \"Strip\" because I can and I know lots of great places but today three co-worker said let's just stay in the hotel and eat and I obliged him, now I want to kick myself in the ass for not knowing about this restaurant/s before.   Our server tonight was ( Brian S ) and he was outstanding. We are four, very seasoned guys and all of our dishes were great and the portions were more than you'll even need and to top it off the prices were low, shockingly lower than expected.  They have an extensive menu and I was watching food go by to other tables and everything looked great. A must for YELPERS!   Do it!",

Same dishes (although I dont think they have all the cheesecakes), same overall menu and look to the restaurant.  I ordered what I usually order at Cheesecake--the miso glazed salmon lunch special! Alway good and filling. Huge portions, even for the lunch size.   Apparently they have a weekend brunch that goes until about 12pm, but they keep the food out until 12:30pm. If you're interested in getting a full breakfast while at the Venetian, this is the place to go.  We opted just to order from the normal menu.  The place is huge, servers are quick and free bread at the beginning, delicious. Great spot for a causal served meal. Happy to say they did have some veggie friendly menu items as well. I think I will try to tofu next time!",

So we came here a few times this week. The omelets were good very mediocre but tasty large quantity garden omelet. I had the pizza which was good but has a little bit of a fake taste. The salmon burger was amazing, I had the bbq salmon which is what I highly recommend most and give 5 stars to very fresh with great flavors! Also recommend the spinach and cheese dip very tasty. The mac and cheese was alittle of a let down for me because it's very basic. I would say all the food is 3.5 and salmon is a 5/5! I recommend going for sure if you haven't . Also open 24/7 which you can't beat",

My group of 4 came here for breakfast after a night of partying. There wasn't a wait, and the restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. Does feel kinda grand inside. The overall look, especially with the orange lighting, is reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory, which is owned by the same company.   The highlight of our meal was the exceptional service we got from our waiter, Mike. He was friendly and personable and checked up on us regularly. I don't usually take note of server's names (although I should start to), so that means he did a really good job.  I ordered the corned beef hash that comes with two eggs and hashbrowns. The corned beef had just the right amount of fattiness. The sunny side up eggs were cooked perfectly with the yolks still runny. And potatoes are always a must for me for breakfast. The portions are pretty big, so we all ended up taking leftovers back to our room. The only con about the dish was that it was a tad too oily and greasy, which made me feel a little nauseous towards the end. But the rest of their menu sounds promising. Will definitely be back whenever we stay at the Venetian or Palazzo!",

Yes its a familiar  menu to anyone that has that one restaurant that serves 60 things (looking at you cheese cake factory) and yes its not the most luxurious unique restaurant. But dammit this food is always fantastic! Another great affordable(relative to Vegas) restaurant that serves a wide array of choices, so good luck thinking you don't have an option.   I can never go wrong with the Cobb salad here. I know it's a Cobb salad how can you screw than up but at the same time how can you make it that great. Well they just do! Whether it's the Panchetta these use in lew of bacon, or just the sheer size of this thing I don't know I don't question because it's good for the 30th time in a row. I've had many different sandwiches here and you just can't go wrong. The appetizers are always spot on, heck even the drinks are good here... Now where can this place go wrong right? Well...  So the service... Listen I can look past a lot of things when the food is good at any restaurant. Which is why this place still gets a 4 star because dammit the consistency is just unreal how good it always is. But the service...they are always pleasant and nice but they can be slow to check on you or bring your food. A lot of these things are pieces of the puzzle and I'm sure is not just one person's fault. Just don't except to be able to come here and get out quickly is all I'm saying.  Grand Luxe is worth the walk if you are saving a few dollars... It's not going to wow you with atmosphere, it's not going to blow you away with service and handcrafted organic offerings.. But it will blow you away with the quality and how much you just paid.. Just go folks you won't be disappointed",

My family & I went here to have a late birthday dinner for my mom (around 12am) and were seated in about 10 mins. The servers were very polite and helpful.  I ordered the Belgian Waffles with strawberries and that had me full right away so portion size was exact.  My sister ordered the chicken waffles & when I had a bite of her chicken, YES. The batter perfectly coated the chicken and gave it a good crisp.  My mother ordered the chicken caesar salad. I'm a bit upset because I wish I ordered it. It was so good. The chicken was grilled & gave it that \"taste\" that was just right. The croutons were to die for! I'm just sad that there wasn't a lot.  My brother ordered steak. Very pricy & he it wasn't cooked the way he wanted but he was so hungry he ate it. All he had was the steak and a side of vegetables for almost $30.  My other brother ordered eggs & steak and he ended up with a bigger steak than my other brother for about $11-17 I believe. He had way more on his platter and left more satisfied.  My father had ordered the breakfast with salmon and he liked it very much.   They were also very helpful and able to surprise our mother with a simple HappyBirthday dish.",

Even though they were all tasty treats, I wished we were allowed to choose the type of given pastries. (Since I'm not a big fruit jam person, any fruit based pastries meant stealing the cinnamon roll or chocolate croissant off my parents' or husband's plate instead)!   Overall - complimentary fruits and pastries  - although a good morning start for our stomach, definitely don't see ourselves paying out of pocket for the meal.

Breakfast is excellent too.  There's a second location at the Palazzo casino next door as well.   Just GO!",

We tried eggs, potato hash, creamy spinach and cheese dip(my favorite), seared rare ahi, avocado and heirloom tomato salad, and the grand club sandwich.   The creamy spinach dip was the best and so was the grand club sandwich. The eggs were great too.   I didn't like the seared rare ahi. It was wasn't very fresh. I guess that's what you get for ordering sushi in Vegas at a breakfast place!  The salad was refreshing, but just make sure you like the dressing. It's best to request it on the side!  I liked that there were lots of options for everyone. Breakfast ends at 11!",

It was crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside with a scoop of vanilla cake on top. Yes! I bow to the butter!  The fudge cake was super rich and was not bitter at all. Very good. The Sliders were your typical Sliders- no complaints there. The caramel chicken was hot, sweet, crispy, tangy and spicy.  My taste buds were flooded with flavor. A very good after concert meal!",

Once the waitress told me I realized that the place did look an awful lot like the same restaurant, but a bit more upscale. Good thing I happen to like cheesecake factory.  The waffle was really really good. It was soft and fluffy and the honey butter sauce just made it perfect. The same thing can't be said about the chicken strips. They were crispy, but they were a little dry on the inside and they were bland. If not for more honey butter I might not have enjoyed my dish as much. Honey butter and chicken are just meant for each other. The portions were huge too. I barely finished half.  Would I come back? Maybe. I think I like cheesecake factory better.",

So I kind of picked it off and placed it on my bread plate.  The bread offered, some was good and some tasted and felt like it had been sitting for a while and warmed and then served.  Shouldn't hurt my teeth to tear into it.  Our waiter was great.    I just wish that the meal would have been better.",

For food:  I had their Cobb salad, and my husband had a burger/fries (the fries were delicious) and the presentation for both were great. My Cobb was HUGE!

No, it was not crispy, it was hard where it was hard to eat... My friends believe their meal was not worth what they paid, it was close to $20 for their dish and their steak was BLAH.

My co-workers and i decided to hit up the Grand Lux Cafe, a cousin of the Cheesecake Factory.   It was my first time, the food was surprisingly good; I am not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory entrees, but i was real satisfied with my meal at Grand Lux--salmon piccata...mmmm, yum! Their bread is bomb good (i am picky with my breads. So, bomb good is bomb good!)    If your taste buds are feenin for something different they have \"world\" dishes. They've got Comfort foods, such as chicken and waffles, to tend your hang overs. Basically, Grand Lux provides more on the menu than Cheesecake Factory-- you have a wider variety of good stuff to choose from, and of course, cheesecake.   For you late night to wee-hours of the morning Vegas goers, I am pretty sure they're open all night.  They'll serve you up some breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Whatever you want. YAY!  Service is okay, if your waiter is not around you can flag down someone else wandering.   I am definitely coming back to this place during my next visit.",

    "text": "We had two (three?) meals here during our stay at the Venetian hotel. Decent, but the experience and food quality reminds me a lot of the Cheesecake Factory (who also own the Grand Lux).   They serve your usual rote of bland (or over-salted) American standards: pastas, giant burgers, monstrous breakfasts. On one meal, my husband's Grand Lux Burger was relatively dry, I enjoyed the Shortrib Grilled Cheese, which made for good hangover food, but really nothing to write home about. During another meal I had the corned beef hash, which was nice -- not your typical Denny's canned fare, but the over-easy eggs that I'd ordered were slightly overcooked.  It's relatively inexpensive sit-down fare (by Vegas standards, anyway) - not bad if you want to grab a fairly quick bite in between gambling runs and don't feel like leaving the hotel or patronizing the food court.",

I've been coming here for several years eversince a bellhop from Caesar's Palace recommended to me and my bestest gal pal one late night back when I was 21 yr old young buck.   - Love the beautiful atmosphere (appropriately located in the Venetian) - Love that it is 24 hours (good for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night snack) - Love that is from the makers of the Cheesecake Factory (Lot of similarities) - Extensive menu (so much to choose from it can be overwelming) - Great food (Most of the dishes I've tried are pretty good) - Excellent food presentation (kinda that fancy smacy stuff that you get wooed by) - Good portions (wooh....don't think I've finished a whole meal) - Decent prices (avg meal range anywhere from $8 - $18)  ****BUT...I am tempted to give it 1 less star due to my experience the week before heading Vegas. I called to two seperate times to make reservations for a group of 20. I was put on hold for over 10 minutes and just hung up since I was so frustrated.  Nonetheless, due to convenience our group decided to still  eat there since we were staying at the Venetian over the weekend. When calling from the hotel room (making sure to emphasize I was a guest at the Venetian), I quickly got reservations and hardly waited. A bit shady.....guess that have high priority for hotel guests. Good thing to know in the future  When we got there, we got a long table in the back where they usually have big groups. One long table and it was spacious and private for a bit. SERVICE was excellent. They had two waitresses serving us. So Grand Lux  I guess I forgive you just this once better not let this happen again ; ) ******  Just to note: My friends ate here 3 times when in Vegas since it's the best deal around in the Venetian and still one of the nicest and most decently priced places on the strip.  IF YOU LIKE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY (AND AREN'T THAT INTO THE CHEESECAKE), YOU'LL LIKE IT HERE!",

My g/f had the BBQ pull pork sandwich (again!!!!) and it was the same as last time, very good, just have to say that the side of coleslaw was bland (agian!!!!).

I've been here four times and have had:  Caramel Thai chicken - delicious, thick sweet caramel glave on top of chicken breast bites. It's a humongous plate that should be shared. The sauce is just amazing and the chicken is juicy.   Spaghetti Carbonara: Real melting cheese silces on top, high quality bacon, perfect texture.. I've been to Italy and had the real deal and this is the same if not better  Grilled salmon - as good as expected.. put a hint of lime on it and you're good to go  I've had the breakfast platter (saugage, ham, eggs, etc) and it's very good too, but not that amazing nor unique (overpriced too).  The service is friendly and also make sure you get the smoothies. They're about $6 but worth it. Huge glasses of perfectly blended fruit, mango and rasberry are fantastic!",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times before. I've never been disappointed by the food that comes out of the kitchen, the service, or the view (last time here, saw Lebron James, Donyell Marshall and their posse). This appears to be one of the favorites of my close buddy and his family as well.  The Venetian hotel is known for it's 5 star service and decor, that of classic elegance. The name itself evokes thoughts of royalty and class. The restaurant almost always has a line, especially at night as this is one of the few restaurants open late night with a full palatable menu.  Environment: the restaurant had the main dining hall, a couple side sections and the \"outdoor\" patio. All are very open with high ceilings so that you never feel crowded. Given that this is in the middle of one of the more popular hotels in Vegas, ambient noise is a given. We happened to sit on the patio which is still inside the hotel but enclosed by a 3 foot high antique gate. Perfect for people-watching especially because you have a great view of the hallway leading to Tao nightclub. The tables are a little too closely situated together (I coupe clearly hear the conversation of our neighbors) but you're never hitting elbows. If you're a larger person, request the booth seating because the chairs are designed for people with a BMI of 25 or less.  Waiter/waitresses: she made several trips to our table to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. Every time she came by, she had a smile on her face. Our water cups never went empty nor did our bread basket. Overall, impressive service and something you'd expect at a more intimate 4-star restaurant.  Food: I just learned that this restaurant is owned by Cheesecake Factory. That explains the decor, bread, an much of the menu. The bread basket contains freshly baked honey wheat and sourdough. The crust is crunchy and flaky while the middle of the loaf is soft and chewy, the perfect consistency for bread. The honey aspect of the wheat bread is not overpowering but adds jut a hint of sweetness to enhance your appetite and clear your palate for the entree. For the main course I had the crispy caramel chicken. Basically, it's fancy orange chicken which is served with a medley of vegetables marinated in the sweet and spicy thai sauce covering the chicken as well ad a generous helping of either brown or white rice. The chicken's crust was a little thick, making it difficult to chew. The chicken itself was on the drier side and the sauce a little too sweet. In fact, the dish was more sweet than spicy. If that suits your taste, you may want to check this dish out.  Drinks: just water.  Recommendation: EAT!!!",

We ordered the fried calamari, rock shrimp, and vegetables appetizer.  That was huge.  Fried calamari was not the same as Cheesecake so that was a bit disappointing.    Bf ordered the slow pot roast sandwich ($10) and he said it was delicious.  Fries were good.    I ordered Sheila's Dream Salad, which was ginormous.  It had lettuce, shredded carrots, tortilla strip crisps, peanuts, chicken breast, grapefruit, and other things I forgot.  It was $13 and totally worth it.  My only complaint is that it contains so many ingredients, that there isn't enough lettuce to balance out the salad.  And there was hardly any chicken.    Open 24 hours so it's perfect for any time of the day.",

It felt more like TGIFridays.   We waited forever to give our order, the food took even longer to come. We got there at 7:45 and were seated, but the food didn't show up until 8:50! Most of us had meetings at 9 AM that we had to get to.  We basically had to shovel down the food. The waitress got my meal almost completely wrong, but I didn't have time to have them do it again.  The total bill for 3 coffees, a salmon omelet, french toast, bowl of fruit and breakfast platter came out to $67.   I had originally planned to go here tomorrow night for a cocktail hour before going to see a show- but I'm definitely not doing that anymore.",

    "text": "My granddaughter and I have decided to meet weekly and have lunch together on the strip where she works.  We chose Grand Lux Cafe as our start.  We were promptly seated and the section we were in  was not crowded.  Nevertheless, it took 20 minutes for our waiter to appear.  In the meantime, when the bus person came, I mistook them for the waiter and they let me know in minimum words, tone,  and tempo that they were not the waiter. Interestingly enough, when the waiter did appear, he too used the same communication style as the bus person.  We ignored the lack of communication skills and asked for some clarifications of the menu and ordered: Crispy Calamari, Fuji Apple Salad,  and the Honey Cashew-Honey Kale salad.  By the time the food arrived, we had lost 49 minutes of my granddaughter's lunch hour.  The batter on the calamari batter was mushy, not throughly cooked, so we asked the waiter to remove it declining a replacement due to time.  The Honey-Cashew Kale salad had an excellent crispy texture but was extremely bland in taste.  My granddaughter requested shrimp in her Fuji Apple salad and was given 2 measly shrimp, split in two, to appear as if it was 4 for a $5 additional charge.  The manager came by and using the very same communication style as his subordinates, with a steroid boost of monotones, stated his concerns and that he would remove the calamari from our bill as if he was doing something benevolent for us.  As we left and passed the hostess, who WAS NOT and DID NOT have ANY customers to serve (no problem figuring out why) failed to bid us farewell or happy returns.  While the food and customer service was throughly disappointing, the atmosphere was pleasant, so... you've been warned.",

Miraculously, they are able to serve several smaller parties that came in behind us.  I would think they'd ask us if we would mind splitting up.

Second, they have some bomb appetizers like Flautas and this crispy shrimp thing.  Third, their Mojitos are awesome.   Fourth, It is reasonably priced for the portions you get. You could easily split their entrees.   Definitely a spot I try to hit up when I stay around the Venetian/Palazzo. I also believe there is one in the Venetian and one in the Palazzo.",

Both times it took over 30 minutes to be seated, another 10 to have the order taken and another 20 to be served.  This was at 6:30 in the morning.  The food is diner food.  Nothing to write home about or make this place a destination.  I do give them kudos for some of the best orange juice, but for $4 per glass it had better be.",

Then we switched to some breakfast items; however, my kid started crying that he doesn't want eggs and I went to another waitress to ask if I can order burgers. She checked with the kitchen guys and told us that we can order them and it's gonna take them about 15 min to make. Then our waitress Christina came to us and I told her that I wanna switch back to burgers. She said I cannot do it since they've already started my order. What?!?!? You gave me the wrong info in the first place and now you don't wanna do anything to keep your customers happy? She was very rude and unprofessional with a very bad attitude that is not supposed to take place on the 5-star property such as the Venetian/Palazzo. She literally ruined my good impression about the whole experience at the Palazzo.",

Initially, one of the hostesses seated us in the outer area, where you can see and hear all the people walking to and from the garage and shops. When we asked for a quieter table on the inside, she took us 3 steps over to a table that was just as bad. We asked the waitress if we could sit \"inside-inside\", and she re-directed us to a different hostess. That one seated us near the entrance - still not inside-inside the actual restaurant. Then, we had to spend our meal watching other parties of 2 get seated inside-inside - quite a few of them, actually. From what we overheard, they weren't joining other parties, nor did they have reservations (this being a cafe, and all). So what was the problem? Did we not look old/important enough, hence not threatening enough to get seated where we specified? Why's it like pulling teeth?   Regarding the food, the Garlic Shrimp Pasta and Hawaiian Smoothie I ordered were great and tasty, but the Short-Rib Grilled Cheese my sister ordered was not \"one of the best sandwiches\" she's ever had, like some people on here who claim it was one of the best sandwiches they've ever had. The waiter was good, though. I think his name was Eric. The ambiance inside the actual restaurant seemed visually appealing and easy on the eyes - from what we were able to see of it.",

My friend has nut allergies and made sure to let our server know that. Her salad arrived full of almonds,  so our server comped her salad for the inconvenience.   Overall the dining experience was great. Everyone enjoyed their food, it was fresh, hot, flavorful, and large portions. We had buffalo chicken rolls (a must for buffalo chicken fans), entree salads, miso salmon (I recommend subbing the rice for mash potatoes) jambalaya, chicken n waffles,  and a sandwich.

Chips were grease-less, crisp, and crunchy. 10/10 would recommend. x Seafood Salad (Lump Crab, Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Corn, Green Beans, Egg, Celery and Green Onion Over a Bed of Crisp Romaine Tossed with Our \"Louis\" Dressing) - SOOO much of everything. This salad was HUGEEEE. Shared the two dishes and we were stuffed. Everything was good except the shrimp.. tasted and cut like rubber.

    "text": "Three words: CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!! Two More: EAT HERE!        I'd heard of Grand Lux being a Cheesecake Factory owned chain, and saw one last weekend in L.A off of Wilshire. I  yelped 24 hour restaurants in Vegas and the second one that shows up was this one. We arrived at 11:45 p.m this past Thursday and everyone from the hostess that answered our questions on the phone to the bus boy that gave us water was nice, professional, and attentive!! It's hard to find good food and excellent service during normal hours of the day let alone at midnight! Only in Vegas, I guess. Our waitress was so nice and gave us some suggestions on what clubs are hot at the moment. We loved it so much we went back the next night at around 10 p.m. (would've gone three days in a row, but no time!)and same deal except this time we noticed they offered chicken and waffles on their menu. GOURMET CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! TAKE THAT ROSCOES!! For dessert we got a dozen pecan chocolate chip cookies to go for something around $6.00 and they were made fresh!! You can't beat that!!  Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory! Trust, I went to one at Caesar's and everyone there thought they were too good to work there or threw their dirty laundry with other workers out in the open with us. Not classy.       I urge you not to waste your money or time on crap late night food cafes that over charge you for undercooked food and bad service. Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory!",

    "text": "I ate at the Grand Lux Cafe (GLC) at the Venetian Resort this evening -- one of many visits to this restaurant since the top-rated Venetian opened in May 1999. I arrived around 6:00PM after cruising the G2E Global Gaming Show all day. The restaurant was crowded but, thankfully, there was no wait to get in.  I was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and was offered a seat in the Bar area rather than the main restaurant. (I'm glad they didn't seat me on the casino terrace as I don't like that area at all -- mostly because the scent they fill the casino with is obnoxiously strong there.) There are two TVs in the bar -- one was tuned to a sports channel while the other was tuned to the first presidential debate.The restaurant areas I visited appeared clean, fresh and well-cared for. My table and seating area were also clean and the table was set for two. I was given a glass of water, a 1/2 loaf of their amazing sourdough bread and a generous serving of butter within just a few short minutes of being seated.  My waiter, Charles S., was very friendly and attentive and he wholeheartedly agreed with my choice of dinner: Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella. The large main dish portion was made with fresh ingredients and presented nicely on a large clean plate. There was lots of tasty, well-prepared pasta with a tomato, cream and garlic sauce; a generous portion of flavorful grilled chicken breast; and many appealing small orange and red pear-shaped \"mini\" tomatoes. The dish was garnished with fresh mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and a basil pesto. The menu claims the tomatoes are roasted but mine did not appear that way. A very delicious and filling dish. The iced tea I was served also passed muster though the refill I was offered was a tad strong for my liking.  GLC is owned by the same company that owns The Cheesecake Factory. I have eaten at many GLC locations across the country and I'm always happy with the facility, food and staff. The price for meals is a bit on the high side (my dinner this evening with tax and just over 20% tip was a tad under $26) but well worth it for the quality of the experience.  -- 4.3 well-deserved stars",

I ordered a cappuccino but it came in a coffee cup which I think is totally weird, but it was good. They offer a breakfast buffet so I cruised through it but was not impressed so we all ordered a la cart. I was HUNGRY so I ordered bacon and eggs AND blueberry pancakes. It was good, bacon was crispy, eggs were cooked just right, hash-browns were nice and crispy. I like the big plump blueberries in the panckage. My husband had the chicken and waffles. That waffle was the BEST waffle EVER! I ended up eating his. My friends got the salmon platter and breakfast sandwich. The salmon/lox were really really good. The sandwich was big and my friend was only able to eat half. Overall it was a good breakfast but I would definitely get a waffle next time. Service was ok, they were busy. Plates are big enough to share.",

    "text": "By leaps and bounds this was the worst experience of my 5 days in Vegas. I consider myself a somewhat optimistic person, but I am at a complete loss for positive things to say about this place. I went here at brunch/lunch time to grab a quick bite before heading back to a conference, and I now wish I would've made the walk to McDonalds so I would've had some quality food and service - you heard right, McDs is quality compared to this junk.  My friends both ordered omelettes and I went with a chicken sandwich that involved avocados. The food wouldn't have even been all that bad if they wouldn't have... A) taken 25 minutes to deliver the goods, B) forgotten to tell us that they messed up our order and needed a few extra minutes, C) neglected to explain their mistake, D) placed my food under the warmer so that my bun became burnt and my lettuce an ever-appetizing wilty black, E) neglected to say one more word to us the entire meal - not even thank you.  Sometimes a restaurant delivers crappy food but the service makes up for the mistakes, and sometimes a black hole emerges in the kitchen and maliciously sucks in every hint of good service and humanity of the entire staff. I probably should have expected all of this knowing that the restaurant the bastard child of Cheesecake Factory, but that damned blind optimism got the best of me. Spend the extra cash and go somewhere else, or go to the food court and get a respectable panini, or just don't eat and get a martini instead - any option is a step in the right direction as long as it is a step away from Grand Lux.  Also, a side note - there was something like 200 items to order from on this menu, meaning that I can rest assured that the entrees have been frozen longer than Ted Williams, yum yum.",

They have very great variety. The menu is pretty overwhelming because they pretty much have every food possible (that's American that is).   The first time I came here was for after hours food, and tried some of their desserts. The strawberry shortcake was amazing =) My friend also ordered the sloppy joe, which was pretty good too. I'm a huge fan of dessert though and I think this place definitely has pretty yummy desserts.  The second time I came for lunch and just had their grand lux burger sandwich and frieds. It was a pretty filling meal and tasted pretty good. I was craving a burger at the moment so it was awesome to me.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the Venetian because I love the whole Venice architecture of the hotel, and the cafe definitely lived up to that feel too. Open 24hrs, cozy place, nice ambiance, good food, and decent pricing...I'd definitely want to come back here everytime I go back to Vegas again =)",

If cheesecake factory tasted this good, I'd go more often.  My fiance and I went exactly at Friday 12:01am.  Pros:  A sign of a healthy and good restaurant are full tables even at midnight.  After getting of the plane starving for something good, my fiance told me Yelpers recommend this place.  We were staying at the Treasure Island and this restaurant was located inside the Venetian across the street.  I loved our waiter Abraham.  He made us feel welcome, recommended some great dishes for us to try, and even went in the back to ask the chef the secret to preparing those wonderful mashed potatoes spring rolls! (I'm not imparting the secret, you'll just have to go ask the restaurant yourselves).  We tried the aforementioned mashed potatoes spring rolls, their flautas, and an order of their prime rib sloppy joes.  Everything was delicious!  I was all rejuvenated and ready to go back out there and gamble some more!  Cons:  So many choices, such a small stomach.  I couldn't have thought of anything wrong with the meal.  Bottom line: Next time I go back to Vegas and am craving a midnight meal, I'll so go back to the Grand Lux!",

If you're tired of all the other cafes that open late at night with the Hot dog + pizza menu, I'd definitely come here. I think they have a decent menu for a cafe that opens until the wee hours of the morning.   Our server was super busy (on Sunday @ 2AM), and was late bringing out our food, but the manager came and apologized for him and then offered us more food to tide us over, but we declined his kind offer.  I had the Max Burger and thought it was worth every penny.  What a giant mess!  I ate it in 2 meals.   I know, I came to a cafe and ended up getting a burger anyway, which I could have gotten down the street at Sonic's, but I still maintain that this place is better than the other cafes.    I would definitely come back, considering the variety of options and non- fluorescent atmosphere and esp. the fact that you pay the same price, but get more for your money here.",

    "text": "This review is based on a terrible 20 minute end to an otherwise enjoyable time in the bar area of the Grand Lux Cafe. Two friends and I walked into the bar to have a couple of drinks before calling it a night (our first and only drinks of the night). One of us, who does not drink alcohol, ordered a coffee beverage (latte), his wife ordered a mojito and a shot of tequila, I decided to take a shot with her, so I ordered a shot of Belvedere and a pour of Balvenie 12 year as my sipper. The waiter brought out four drinks. The latte, my friend's mojito and two shots, one clear (vodka) which he gave to me and one brownish-gold (tequila) which he gave to my friend. I hate shots so I was waiting for my Balvenie to have something to sip after, but it was taking a while. Fortunately, I had a bottle of water I had brought in with me, so we went ahead with our shots (which were very generously poured, btw). After a few more minutes, I asked the waiter for a status on my Balvenie. He then told me he already brought it. I explained that he had brought my shot of Belvedere, but not my pour of the Balvenie. He didn't seem to believe us, but acknowledged and walked away, presumably to take care of it. A new waiter then came over and asked what happened, and we explained again. He seemed more accepting and intent on correcting the issue and proceeded to get my pour of Balvenie. With that in hand, we decided to order another round of shots. The tequila was way too strong for my friend, so she decided to take my advice and join me in another shot of Belvedere as I found it quite smooth. We drank our shots and the second one definitely tasted much harsher and was a noticeably more conservative pour than the first shot (if I were a more cynical person, I would question whether it was actually Belvedere) and continued talking, laughing and simply catching up with each other. Then the bill arrives:  They charged me for two Balvenie pours even though I only received the one I ordered. The difference between the Balvenie 12 and the Belvedere is only $1.50, but it wasn't correct and I did not feel responsible for having to pay for what I did not receive. I called the waiter over and explained that the bill was off and the situation (this is now the second one who came to help resolve the issue in the first place) and after explaining once again what had happened he acknowledged and stepped away. No big deal, people make mistakes. A few minutes later a gentleman that I presume is the manager, as I do not recall him introducing himself or being remotely cordial to us as customers at his restaurant, came over to talk about the confusion. I then proceeded to explain once again what happened. After a bit of what felt like cross examination, I and my friends explained the situation about three different times. Once again, the difference between a shot of Belvedere and a pour of Balvenie 12 is $1.50! One of the concerns this gentleman raised, which I found the most ridiculous was the notion that the first waiter was now gone and couldn't confirm what happened as if we were only now raising this issue and had not already addressed it with both the first waiter and the second waiter who was still present. Also, essentially implying that we were lying and without another, obviously honest, witness to validate our story, we should pay this bill. He then stepped away for quite some time, questioning the bartender, questioning others to get to the bottom of what he seemed to be treating as our conspiracy to pay $1.50 less on our $88 tab. I stepped away to use the restroom because he took so long to come back. When I got back, I was told by my friends that the presumed to be manager came back again and once again argued stating he spoke to the bartender and they confirmed that apparently the entire night they only poured two shots of Belvedere and two pours of Balvenie. Shortly after them taking me through this (our laughter, fun and good mood on our one night together in Vegas completely eliminated) the second waiter came back with the corrected bill, apologized sheepishly, and walked away. For the record, I do not blame the waiter. I'm sure he was probably trying to reverse and correct the charge, needed a supervisor or manager to approve this and then we got Sherlock on the case of my nefarious attempt to come to Vegas, spend an average of $90 on each of my personal meals, average of $20 on each cocktail at the Cosmo and Aria (which I adamantly recommend over this place) and $100 on a ticket to see The Who, only to cut costs and even out for the weekend by stealing a dollar and fifty cents from the Grand Lux Cafe.   (BTW, I just noticed the tequila shot was $18. If we were going to lie about a drink to save money, why wouldn't we go for the $8 savings instead of the $1.50 savings? $8 would have almost covered the tip I still left for the waiter).",

But the waitress recommended the spicy ginger beef which uses even more tender beef supposedly. It tasted almost the same just a little bit more spicy and gingery. I think if I ordered it without the spice and ginger it wouldve tasted nearly the same with just the sauce and green onions. But the spicy ginger beef was just WOW. i didnt expect it to be that good!",

And it turns out, that I guess this place is a chain since it sells trademarked Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake.  Once I figured this out, I knew the portions were going to be HUGE!    I ordered the parmasean crusted chicken.  After we ordered, we were given very fluffy and warm bread. We killed the first bread almost immediately.  Then I needed to use the restroom.  I hate how a lot of restaurants in Vegas have their restrooms outside and not inside.  It isn't convenient at all.    It took awhile for our food to come out.  We were hungry so we asked for another loaf of bread.  Yum, still warm and fluffy as ever.  Finally the food comes, and the presentation looks amazing.  The chicken was breaded very nicely and the edge was crispy as hell.  The inside was juicy too.  Although I thought the spaghetti that came with it tasted very bland in the beginning, I realized it worked really well with the parmasean chicken.    Eating regular meals in Vegas is so hard, especially for a gambler like me.  It's nice to sit down at a nice restaurant and have a hardy meal.",

We arrived around 11:30am and were seated immediately.  We placed our order at 11:40am.  Our waiter took the orders of the table behind us AFTER he had taken our orders, but their food came out BEFORE us.  I was not happy.    Our waiter stopped by our table at least 3 times to tell us our food was on its way out.  I seriously wanted to tell him to not come back until he had our food in his hands!!! Strangely when our food was ready, another person brought out our food. Maybe he was afraid of us?  I had a pasta dish which I was really looking forward to, but it only tasted ok. The pasta was dry and hard.  Really lacking in flavor. I was disappointed.  My friends ordered the breakfast dishes.  They tasted pretty good. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish? I'm going to have to try out the Grand Lux in Chicago just to see how things match up.",

When we headed in, the restaurant was a bit dark, with a very comfortable atmosphere. The service, however, was decent but not really great. They were cordial, but not very attentive or friendly, which I suppose was fine since we were more interested in talking to each other anyway.   To start with, the drinks aren't bad at all. There was always something good to drink, at pretty standard prices.   The food is actually mostly decent as well. We tried some dinner/lunch food such as burgers and also a chili dog meal, and they were okay, though perhaps not the best. The desserts, however, were absolutely wonderful. Our favourites were the creme brulee (I'm a huge creme brulee lover, so getting to try two was pretty nice) and the beignets, which were amazing.   If I were specifically looking to go out, I might not choose this, but when we were headed back from the casino or the club, or just looking for something to eat nearby, it was a trustworthy option.",

Took like 20 minutes! 20!!!!!!!  The food was good, my boyfriend had something with chicken, pasta and shrimp, and I had the spaghetti carbonara.  The next day I ordered pick up and brought it up to the room. The pancakes are delicious, so is their chilaquiles. Perfect hangover food.",

    "text": "After 3 days of convention and fast food, I decided to dine in and eat real food. Hence the Grand Lux, a great place to have a casual meal in a clean and spacious restaurant with stylish decor (yes like Cheesecake Factory).  I ordered a soup and salad that came with sourdough bread. The soup of the day was chicken tortilla, simple but very flavorful and filling. The sourdough was probably the grossest (is that a word?) I've ever had. The ceasar's salad was nothing special.  I also tried their chicken and waffles, which comes with no sides so I ordered fries as well (fat @ss!). The dipping sauce for the chicken is really what enhances the dish and the waffles were just as delicious.  The service I received here was better than mediocre, our server was friendly enough and the food was quick. Great food, good service, extensive menu and a nice looking restaurant. I will definitely return again.",

Imperial pint of Boddington's...Check.  The menu here was extremely enticing and I found myself struggling to select just one dinner.  We decided to order a plate of nachos as an appetizer to start us off and quench some of the hunger within.  After drinking some beer and some nachos we decided it was time to get some dinner.  Boss order a cheeseburger and I opted for the Grand Lux burger (with the spare rib on it).  What was delivered was a vision of pure deelish.  I love burgers (I've done Collin's Pub, XXX, Red Mill, and so on)...and this burger definitely would give them all a regimental rodgering.  I think I spent about 15 solid minutes just savoring all of the flavor of this burger.  Whatever they did to my burger I hope gets repeated into perpetuity because it was magical.  Enjoy Yeeps.",

Service was absolutely wonderful (on Friday). My husband and I had the pleasure of having Otilija serve us Friday night. She was sweet, professional, respectable, and very personable. On Saturday evening, the service was okay. I was not too happy with the service. The waiter started off nice, but it seemed like he didn't want to wait on us after we ordered our food. The sad thing is that he didn't even thank us when we left and he was literally standing a couple feet away from our table waiting to take away the check. Yes, he was even looking at us.

Everyone in our group was vegetarian- hence we had questions about possibly modifying certain meals ie removal of meat and apparently the server didn't like having to clarify with the kitchen. Maybe there needs to be an indicator on your menu of an item can be made vegetarian?   The food came out after a long time of waiting. We had to flag down other staff to get drinks ordered because our server would flee the area as quickly as he could.   The food was mediocre at best. The vegetarian burger was dry and kind of bland. When we pointed out that there was an issue with my friends burger the server practically yelled at us to ask \"what's missing?\"...   The potato spring rolls are really good, Mac and cheese is worth skipping, nachos are decent.   A couple people got omlettes and the orders were all wrong but we had already waited so long for food that it was not worth sending back.   I would give them 3 stars for food, but the terrible service and attitude of our server really made the experience terrible. It was so uncomfortable and to a point where we almost asked for someone else..",

The only thing that he say about the grant looks cafe is that I did not see that grand.

I'm not sure if maybe the air hindered my tastebuds or what but this place really didn't do it for me.   The menu is pretty much food that you would find at the cheesecake factory, but more expensive and kinda sloppily put together. Honestly pretty mediocre food.  I started off with the Ahi ceviche ($13.95) which includes raw ahi tuna chopped up and combined with lime juice, onions, cucumber, avocado. It was pretty good with the chips but didn't seem that fresh. Chips were crispy. The Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya ($19.95) was pretty basic and nothing special. Just seemed like a bunch of stuff thrown together with some tomato sauce and rice. The Almond Crusted Trout ($23.95) was bland and the breading wasn't crispy. At this price, I would have expected the presentation to be a little better, instead of just putting things on a plate. The trout had string beans just thrown on top of it.",

I adore both the full-service restaurant, as well as the bakery section, where you can pick up to-go orders. There are two, one in the Venetian and one in the Palazzo. The Palazzo serves cooked food until 3:30am, and then cold salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and all the espresso drinks you can dream of. The one in The Venetian is 24 hours. I've had several things on the menu, as it's on a property that I work in. The quality of every single item on the menu was beyond satisfaction, always extremely fresh, and made correctly, to the \"T.\" I'm sure I will continue to go there many times over.",

The waffle was light and fluffy topped with pieces of pecan and fried chicken were shaped as sticks. The fried chicken sticks were coated in panko and seasoned very well. Overall I enjoyed my breakfast. The waitress was very good on refills of coffee, water, and soda. I would come back again for dinner. FYI, parking at Palazzo is free for now.",

The decor and menu is quite similar and anyone can find something to munch on given the diverse and plentiful options they have.  Our first visit was for dinner and service was great.  Our server was on the ball and came by to check on us many times during our meal.  Portions are out of control and enough to feed at least 2 per entree.    Our second visit was for lunch before leaving Vegas and the service then was a bit marginal as the waitress that time seemed to be all over the place.  She forgot to bring out people's orders and had to go back to the kitchen a couple of times during that visit.  Overall, if you are dining with a group who has varied taste, this place will fit the bill as anyone should be able to find something they like off their huge menu.",

    "text": "Went to Grand Lux Cafe for brunch with some of my girlfriends for a bachelorette.  We decided to find somewhere convenient since there's a huge group of us and we were getting hangry, so down the elevators a few steps- we found this place.  We were greeted by a hostess that brought us to our table of 10. We had our drinks ordered by a waiter after 5 minutes.  My friends and I decided on the Grand Mimosa which has sparkling wine, Grand Marnier and OJ.  When it came out, the strawberry was very old and was going bad not only for my drink but my friends had the same issue.  The drink overall was so flat that I left it after taking 2 sips.. So I wouldn't suggest ordering this beverage.  For brunch- you can either do the Grand Lux Express, where it's a buffet style breakfast and you get to pick and choose what you'd like from bacon, sausages, eggs, crepes etc over at another room of the restaurant where it is hosted.  But I opted out on that and just got a basic eggs, ham & toast kind of meal.  Everything tasted fine, mediocre and nothing extravagant, I mean, there's nothing special about my dish anyway.  My friends seem to be okay with their dishes.  There really isn't much to complain about if you're here for a solid basic meal.  Wish we were here for lunch because I would much rather have that at 10am than my boring breakfast.   Our server seems flustered because there was so many of us that it took awhile to get the orders in- delaying our food... And we didn't want to give him a hard time about the mimosa although 4 of us couldn't finish it. All in all, it's a place to eat- that's it lol.",

Ended the evening with the \"best carrot cake\" and it tasted just like Cheesecake Factory's...and come to find out the two restaurants have the same management.

This place was moderately priced, there wasn't a wait, and it got pretty good reviews on Yelp. Their wait staff was on top of things. We got some bread and our waters. It took us a little while to look over their menu; there were so many options. Again, it was comparable to the Cheesecake Factory. Both the Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux have similar dishes. I ended up ordering the chicken pot pie and my boyfriend ordered some sort of Thai chicken. At that point, I had never eaten chicken pot pie before. I only got it because I was craving peas and carrots. Haha, I don't know if anyone ever craves peas and carrots. We were both in for a treat when our meals came out. They were HUGE! It was lunch time but we ate so much that we couldn't eat dinner that night. There was enough food for four people. We hate wasting food, so we ate pretty much all of it.",

    "text": "My girlfriend dragged me there by force basically (its a mystery how someone so small can be so strong lol). I loved the place! I read yelp reviews that helped me make a choice on what to order. Everything was sooo delicious!  We ordered small chicken pot pie, chicken buffalo balls, and spinach and artichoke dip. Omg! Everything was seriously delicious! That chicken pot pie tasted amazing and it was huge! Somebody here complained about the \"small\" size of the pie (and they ordered large! - are you out of your mind girl?! This thing is enough to feed an army.. Exaggerating, obviously.. Lol but the point is that even the small size is actually pretty big, enough for 2 people to share or for 1 person to eat but without ordering anything else. Keep that in mind. Artichoke and spinach dip was also perfect. Great texture! I could taste all those crazy calories but it was so good that I didn't care anymore lol Buffalo chicken balls with ranch were good. My gf is obsessed with them, really. I liked them but I didn't care for them as much as for chicken pot pie and s&a dip. I will absolutely be back to this place, so many other good things to try. Can't wait :)",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to go in Vegas because it's always so consistent. If you like Cheesecake Factory you'll also like Grand Lux as they're owned by the same company. Be prepared for the huge menu just like Cheesecake Factory.   For the first time, I went with the fish of the day which was Sea Bass. For my 2 sides, I went with broccoli x2. Got capers and onions to go on top as well. My buddy got mushrooms to go with his salmon and I borrowed some of them. All together it was delicious! At $23.95 it was one of the most expensive things on the menu so the place is reasonably priced in general.   The fish was moist (definitely a little undercooked but I didn't mind because at least they didn't dry it out) the broccoli was hard and understeamed but also didn't bother me.   I didn't try it but my buddies had the bread and it looked heavenly.   This really hit the spot after a day in the sun at Tao Beach.   Will definitely be back and you should give it a shot too!",

    "text": "Had the worst service imaginable for Saturday morning brunch,  which is hard to believe considering the food is a buffet and the only thing the waitress had to do was take the order and refill drinks every once in a while.  I was out here for a conference that had just ended and was dining alone, and it was quite clear that I was an afterthought to the waitresses.  It was 8am on a Saturday, and the place was pretty empty at that point so the wait staff had me seated very quickly as there was no line. I sat at the table that I was placed at in the bar area and waited almost 10 minutes for someone to take my order.  I am usually understanding and don't want to cause a fuss, especially when a place is busy, but there were only 10 diners  in the room at the time, and four waitresses. Eventually one came over and asked if I had been helped yet, which I had said I was not and she apologized and took my order and brought me my coffee, water, and Tabasco.  A few minutes later, the waitress that I guess was actually supposed to be assigned to my table, the check later said Patricia Z so I'm guessing that was the waitress that was supposed to be helping me,  asked if I wanted juice as it was included with the buffet and I politely declined as I was fine with coffee and water, and I guess I was handed off to her at that point, which was a shame given the first waitress to help me actually did something.  I proceeded to the buffet and finished my water first, and as I noticed that no one was coming back to fill it I started my timer and started nursing my coffee.  Eventually I finished my coffee as well and now had both glasses conspicuously sitting at the end of the table, and finally 28 minutes and 34 seconds later the waitress that was supposed to be working my table finally stopped by and asked if I wanted a refill (yes please)! She then brought refills of both along with the check (I guess that was supposed to be my sign to leave).  As I was drinking my coffee and water she stopped by later and conspicuously stared at the empty check book and asked if I was ok (huh, ok). During this time she was doting on the table of 6 that was sitting next to me, obviously now banking on the better tip coming from them, which I was not going to disappoint her there due to the non-existent service. I took to writing my Yelp review halfway through waiting for the refills, and as I was still typing she came back with a table busser and asked if I was done while removing my empty plate and asked if I needed change. At that point a line was forming outside the restaurant, so obviously they wanted the table, and I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I said no and walked out.  Unfortunately the check amount was $27.01 and I was regretting not having any loose change but did have $28 so she unfortunately did get a $0.99 tip that she did not come close to deserving.  I would definitely stay away from this place.",

But then you also don't want to because you're hungover in Vegas? I ordered the Mendocino salad because it checked off all the things I like in a meal size salad I am eating in place of deep fried vacation foods. Grilled Chicken Avocado  Goat Cheese something crunchy  (Cornbread-Cheese Croutons! super yummy) and weirdly, Dates - which worked pretty well. Light vinaigrette and I was sold. So I am familiar with US portion sizes but this salad was so friggin big I was shocked. I can eat a lot but after 15 min my husband commented that it didn't look like I'd touched it. I conceded defeat. Deadly salad, bring a friend and share it.",

I like the location inside the Venetian better than the one in the Palazzo but the food is just as good at both.   They have great bread,  good omelettes refreshing ass Arnold Palmer's. The patty melt is good all of the sandwiches are great. The grilled cheese with pulled pork is yummy as well as the Santa Barbara chicken sandwich. They have those amazing cafe fries that are crispy but soft at the same time.   BUT, The most amazing thing they have in their Encyclopedia like menu are the burgers. Holy shit their burgers are bomb. Outrageously good!!!!  Add bacon, cheese, avocado, crispy onions, add mushrooms, add pulled pork, add anything to it and it's going to be delicious!!!!! Man it sucks that I can't get one in Los Angeles anymore. But one of these when you're drunk or even sober is out of this world!!!  Also David was our server last time and he had such a great attitude for working the overnight shift dealing with a bunch of drunks, lol  Great service from him!",

The menu is equally extensive with just about anything you could want ranging from basic salads, sandwiches and burgers to breakfast foods to Asian fusion items to insanely large desserts.    We dropped by at an off time (2:30PM) but the place was still very full and busy. We had an early dinner planned so we opted to share a few appetizers and had drinks. We shared the spring rolls, crab cakes and strawberry shortcake dessert. Note: even though it says \"spring\" rolls these are more like egg rolls and deep fried. The inside is kind of a mushy texture so it wasn't obvious that it was chicken and shrimp. The crab cakes were surprisingly good, with each (two per order) a good size and filled with a generous amount of real crab. Mustard-y sauce was a great tangy complement. Strawberry shortcake was huge with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. Very sweet and decadent but not the most amazing in terms of quality of shortbread. Drinks were solid and the drink menu offers everything from wines to different kinds of bellinis to bloody Mary's and more!  Overall solid option and great for variety but nothing amazing.",

I got the fettucini alfredo which was insanely heavy and the extra broccolini and sundried tomatoes did not lighten it up.  I felt a little too full after this.

    "text": "Somebody posted a review saying this is exactly like the Cheesecake Factory, and I'd have to disagree.  While yes, it is owned by the same people, Cheesecake Factory, to me, is a too-large menu where every dish comes to you simplified and blander than necessary where if Cheesecake Factory would just figure out what they wanted to excel in- they'd be great.  Enter Grand Lux Cafe. Exactly what I've wished Cheesecake Factory would do. Grand Lux seems like they figured out everything they did well, and only put those on this menu. Either that- or I, and the people at the table, ordered really well.  But, what really stood out was our service. Quick, no nonsense, and always there for a refill, question, or helpful advice- LINDA C. was THE BEST server I have had in a really long while, and (if you didn't notice) I'm very critical when it comes to service. Not only was I a restaurant trainer, but moreso- I was a BOH trainer, and anybody in the industry knows- there's an unspoken line between Front of the House and Back of the House. So, a server of mine is already battling with some prejudice when I sit down.  I have to tell you- if I could- I'd take Linda C. with me to show any future trainees- THIS is what a server does, how they look, how they act, and the service every customer should expect when they decide to be lazy and not cook their own food.  I hope this review finds its way to somebody at Grand Lux for further accolades for Ms. C.  I couldn't have been happier with my meal.  Easy 5 stars.",

We saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. We ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. The food fell below my expectations. I thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure.   Food:  Chicken jambalaya: pretty weird, but okay in taste. The chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side.  Ahi tuna tartare- Not the best. Didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but I'm a raw fish/sushi snob.   Price: pretty expensive for the quality. Similar to the cheesecake factory price wise.  Overall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. Some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late.",

    "text": "My fiance and two of our friends came here on a Sunday for a late breakfast and although I will say the food was amazing, unfortunately the service was not (hence the 3 stars). We were sat right away which was great and upon arriving, our server came over to greet us and gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted to order. We ordered some coffees along with our food and honestly our server was super personable and nice...the weird part was that this was the last time we saw her.   As we waited for our food, a few tables were seated after us and got their food within 15-20 minutes while we still hadn't gotten ours. So we continued to wait maybe 30-40 more minutes without any sign of our food and not once did anyone check on our table. Finally I waved someone down (he looked like the manager) and let him know we had been waiting for a long time and were wondering how soon our food would come out. He simply said \"it should be coming out soon\" so I asked him if it typically takes this long (the restaurant was half empty) and he said \"well no, but your server was feeling sick and went home so it just took a lot longer than normal for anyone to put your order in\". I guess it made sense since we never saw her after we placed our order but I just thought it was weird how casual and non-apologetic he was about the whole thing. I would just think someone would've come over to let us know what was happening in which case we would've been understanding of the situation. Another 15 minutes go by and we get our food everything was great minus the bagel that came with my fiance's entree...it was literally burnt to the point that the bagel was entirely black so we asked for a replacement. That was it...we never got a new server and no one ever checked on us again. We had to waive someone down to get the check and even then it took so long for anyone to help us. Not that we would expect any sort of comp, but I was honestly surprised that they didn't once try to make up for the lack of service...we paid full price for everything and the manager didn't really seem to care that we had such an terrible experience on their accord. Maybe this was a fluke but I doubt we will go back after what happened which is such a shame because we go to Vegas all the time and the food really was delicious.",

    "text": "This restaurant looked very nice and has a lot of potential however the execution is one of the worst I have ever seen.  First of all the menu is very large and confusing. They give you a menu that has all the options for the entire day instead of what you can actually order for the time your eating.  Even without this extra menu there still are a lot of options that make your choices confusing. If I wanted a buffet I would be going to one of the numerous ones on the strip.   We had a fairly large party for a wedding rehearsal. Now this can be quite a hard task to cater 18 people but they had numerous mistakes that were simply aggravating.   Half of our table was completely ignored for ordering both the drinks and food. The appetizers were already coming to the other guests before we had to insist on ordering drinks.   Also the food orders started coming out wrong as well. Appetizers were brought instead of the actual main course.   Luckily however the food is fantastic. I had the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi and it was some of the most flavourful fish I have ever had. Everyone else at the table as well were raving about the food.   It may have been that we caught the waiting staff on a bad night. I would be willing to come back again to see if it was just an abnormality. .",

Although their horseradish sauce could use A LOT more horseradish - they probably have to make it super mild for middle America.  This place is really affordable for Vegas standards.  Lunch or dinner under $40.00.  Some other great dishes here are the Sicilian Pasta ($10.95) and the Short Rib Shepherds Pie ($14.95).  They start you off with fresh sourdough bread, hot from the oven and the iced tea is fresh brewed.  The menu is giant, just like it's parent company The Cheesecake Factory. Definitely a satisfying meal that's easy on the wallet!",

My friendly waitress from Chicago Amanda was awesome and has worked here since  they opened - 13 years ago now.

First things first, you're in Vegas. Order some cocktails. I had the Peach Bellini, Lux Cosmopolitan, and a Mai Tai. I was buzzing my way outta there when we were done.   My party of 3 had the Buffalo Chicken Rolls and Crab Cakes to start, then onto the Garlic Shrimp Pasta and some Pizza. We had to rush to get to Surrender at Wynn/Encore. This was about 8pm Friday.  5am Saturday, we were coming from Drai's after hours. We were STARVING so we had the famous Steak & Eggs dish.This time, we didn't get dessert. But wait for it.  Following night it was 10pm and we were a little drunk. Not exactly throwing up everywhere and all but things were spinning and our sense of balance just wasn't happening. We came again and this place was kinda busy! 4am! These people never quit in Vegas. Our servers were extra helpful - must be common for them to get delirious people in Vegas because of the heat and the massive consumption of alc. I ordered the Sticky Bun Bread Pudding, friend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake. Let me tell you. I don't know why I chose that over the Cheesecake or the Molten Chocolate Cake, but man. MMM MMM MMM. Sweet, soft breading and crunchy cause of the pecans. Good portions too!  I have to say, with the amazing experience we had here THREE times, we're coming back. Until then, What Happens in Vegas......",

    "text": "Quick Tips:  1. Pretty easy for you to get in very quickly on almost any day. There is also a location on the Palazzo side near the elevators to the rooms that is a little less busy.  2. The theme of the restaurant and even the menus scream Cheesecake Factory to me, but the restaurant has very much it's own character.  3. Open all night! A great destination to unwind from post-clubbing shenanigans.  I love the Grand Luxe Cafe because the times that I've gone there, the servers are not only friendly and willing to give suggestions, but also they are efficient and quick.  Vegas is all about moving from one place to the next, sleeping, and then starting all over the next day. Grand Luxe offers the time for people to cool their heels with decent, quality food. My girlfriend usually orders a pasta dish, while I always try something more adventurous since we're always on a vacation.  It's so sad, but they took away one of my favorite menu items, a carribean style jerk pork chop dish. It had amazing textures and flavors through it, but I guess it wasn't really a popular choice among diners. Anyways, back to other foods, you will always leave Grand Luxe stuffed since the portions are huge and the food is pretty yummy.  One of the things that I really like about Grand Luxe is the price. Though it's $15-18 a plate, the food is still cheaper than dining at most of the sit-down restaurants across the strip. Furthermore, it's not like we waited for more than 10 minutes to get into the place. If it is too busy, and you are willing to do a bit of a walk, you can get to the Palazzo side that sees much less customers.  Anyways, I hope you guys try out Grand Luxe Cafe!",

The food was delicious, and the cocktails were even better. Our waiter handled the large party with aplomb, and the entire experience was great. Of course, the food is pricey, but it's Vegas, and this is just a stepped-up Cheesecake Factory, so you should expect to pay more than you want to for a plate of pasta. Think $17 and up for pasta dishes and $20+ for meat entrees.",

This time, we were at Vdara, but we just had to go there for our late night munchies. Totally worth cabbing there for food.  I love love love their Pasta With Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. (Their pastas are bomb!) The portion was HUGE. Although I was super hungry, I only ate about half of the dish. Good thing though because I woke up hungry still craving Grand Luxe and there was a good amount of pasta left! The sauce was flavorful and evenly distributed throughout the dish. Their chicken was A+. Chicken is my favorite kind of meat, so I am a bit picky about chicken in dishes, but the chicken here is DELICIOUS! It's not dry at all, and they give you a generous amount.  The boys all ordered burgers, and when their orders came out, I wish I ordered my pasta and a burger. Alas, although it sounded okay in my head, it's probably not socially acceptable to order two entrees, huh?   They are pretty busy at all hours, so you might have to wait for their servers a bit. We waited a pretty long time before someone came to take our orders. That was no bueno! But what can you do when this restaurant has a full house and a line at 1am?",

    "text": "The Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas. The Venetian for those of you who may not know, is a very beautiful resort. There are beautiful interior features and rooms, a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone, from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me, I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere.   I came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated, the waitress took our drink orders, customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you, it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it, served halved, crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions, applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday, but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner, I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now, it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside, but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are, the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert, well, there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas, I shall return next trip!",

I ordered the Grilled Steak sandwich but asked to special-order the prep on it to mimic the sausage sandwich (tomatoes, fontina cheese etc).  It was amazing!! Sliced (on the bias), chargrilled steak on a roll.   I was craving something grilled and this totally hit the spot.  Tipped the chef 10 bucks simply for creating it and doing it right.",

He was embarrassed anapologized and wanted to get me another dish but at that time I lost my appetite.  I miss the Grand Lux cafe in LA it was awesome. This is the second time this location at Vegas was terrible. Last time we got there after midnight and all our dishes was greasy and terrible as well.

We couldn't really walk too far since the girls had heels on and walking was really not an option. After a quick escalator ride, we found ourselves situated in front of the Grand Lux Cafe. I knew I bookmarked this restaurant but couldn't remember why and thanks to the awful AT&T network in Vegas, yelping it was not an option. (I remember now that I bookmarked it because it was good for late night snackin!) My friends and I were eager to try it since we were all starving! While walking to our seat, I couldn't help but feel like I'm in a Cheesecake Factory and what do you know.. it's from the same makers!  Between Mr. Dubs and I, we ordered the ahi tuna salad, duck potstickers and burger.  Salad and burger were yums but you can skip the duck pot stickers-- tasted like any other potstickers! From what I heard from around the table, the burgers were the best and judging from the few bites Mr. W. allowed me, it was yummy!  Prices are good-- anywhere you can eat a meal for under $20 on the strip is good in my book.  I'll be back the next time I visit Vegas!",

Frozen cream cheese next to the strawberries (thinking it's whipped cream).....was so stuck to the serving spoon, that people were using their fingers to get it off on to their plates.  Bacon did not have tongs, and people were using their fingers instead. Tasteless food and chef burning cooked to order eggs was a turn off.  My husband was so dissatisfied with the buffet, that he ordered eggs Benedict off the menu. That was actually better. Hash browns tasted like they came out of a box, but the eggs were fresh and hot and the hollandaise sauce was very good.  When we spoke to the manager, he was hearing me, but not really listening. Did not offer any remedy. All he could tell me was that he would look into quality control. Our server was the one who suggested we order breakfast from the menu.

We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress (older Caucasian lady) was pleasant but we noticed the service was not good. We sat among 3 sets of Caucasians families and my husband and myself were the only colored people. We noticed that 2 of the families that were seated after us were given bread and their drinks came before ours. Then we noticed the manager or someone higher than the waitress greeted one of the families and apologized to them for the long wait. A manager or supervisor never came to our table and asked if we were ok. We had to flag down another waiter and asked him for our drink. The food was good but we lost our appetite after seeing what unfolded in front our eyes. Also we waited long for the appetizer and food to come out. It was very noticeable that we were serviced differently than everyone else around us. I think management should educate their staff more on not being racist and treat each of their customer with the same respect and provide equal service. The waitress was clearly racist.",

The atmosphere is great and we didn't have to wait very long to get a table. It's casual and relaxing and we hung out for a long time. They had a buffet that morning but we didn't try it. We also tried the eggs benedict and that was solid too.   This definitely deserves 5 stars not only for the memorable hash, but bc it is in the most beautiful hotel in Vegas.

    "text": "I'll start by saying that Debbie, our waitress, made this a five star experience. If not for her, it very easily would've been two stars.  We decided to come here at 1AM due to a lack of other veggie options (it seems like everything vegan is shut down at midnight for some reason).   The restaurant is nestled in the Venetian hotel, with bistro style seating right next to the casino. Inside, however, it's a bit more intimate with the dim lighting. We could still hear the occasional victory cheers from patrons who hit the jackpot in the casino. Definitely not a quiet place, but a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the casino.   To start, we spent a good amount of time studying the drink menu. They've got some stellar cocktails, all on the weaker side and kind of expensive, but that's the Strip for ya.  Pina colada: not bad. Mojito: the bomb.  They've also got several wine and beer options for those looking to avoid cocktails.   When ordering food, we noticed they have separate menus available depending on what time of day it is. Their overnight menu has a lot of options: my friends got sliders, a breakfast plate piled high with bacon, and a couple cheeseburgers. They also have many steak, pasta, pizza, and salad options. But again, I woefully found a lack of vegan options on this menu.  This is where Debbie came in to save the day. She finagled with the chefs to see if they'd cook up a special dish for me. And they did just that. I was brought a beautiful plate of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, and brown rice. Large servings, well displayed, and made to order. It hit the spot and kept the night from going down a disappointing path.  We never felt rushed. And I was pleased to see one of the chefs, decked out in his nice white chef jacket, personally come out to let us know the progress of our meals.  Debbie checked on us routinely but didn't hover, and she really was a sweetheart.  Ultimately, it was a great late night dining experience.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Venetian so it was convenient for breakfast. Their breakfast ends at 11 am so make sure you get there by then. Breakfast was pretty disappointing after reading all the great reviews. Nothing special. I ordered an omelette with mushrooms Swiss cheese and scallions with hash browns and toast. The omelette was oddly served. I thought the ingredients would be scrambled into the omelette, instead the mushrooms and cheese and scallion were mixed together separate of the egg omelette. The egg omelette wAs just laid over my melted mushrooms and cheese. The omelette lacked any flavor. The hash-browns were tasty. The toast was good with butter. I ordered a tea it was pretty pricy for a plain tea bag. 4.25. But it's Vegas so shouldn't be surprised. The service was waitress was nice and listened to our order, the wait time was maybe 20 min or so from the time we ordered (omelette and an eggs Benedict, fruits and two teas). Do not think I'd go back unless I had to, too many other options to try.",

My bf and I were craving for some food at 3 in the morning, so we set out here to get some grub!  When we arrived, we were immediately seated and our server was very friendly. There is a late night dining menu, which has your salads, pasta, pizza, steaks, and also the breakfast menu! Score!   We ordered:  1. Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls: This is a must-have appetizer! Creamy mashed potatoes with green onions wrapped in egg roll along with bacon, cheddar and a sour cream dip! Very savory and delicious. (5/5)   2. Fresh Garden Omelette: My order came with hash browns, white bread/jam! The omelette consisted of mushrooms, heirloom tomatoes, avocado, zucchini, spinach, Havarti cheese and sour cream. The omelette was very filling; I wasn't a fan of the tomatoes but everything else tasted great. The hash browns were so good! (5/5)  3. Rib Eye Steak: My bf loves his protein and meat. The steak was delicious and you get your choice of mashed potatoes or veggies. He opted for the mashed potatoes and OMG there were mountains of mashed potatoes on his plate! The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and flavorful, yum! (5/5)  Overall, the portions here are big. Like what the other Yelpers say, this definitely reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory with an expansive menu and large portions! Definitely worth your money! =)",

My husband and I were in Vegas with friends and we were the last couple to get in. Everything else was closed except this restaurant. Overall everything was descent. The sauces on the dishes were really good, but my husband didn't really like how thin his chicken was.   The bread was pretty good with the butter. I had the Chicken Indochine Dish (a curry dish but had characteristics of an Indian curry and a Chinese curry). My husband had the Chicken Madeira. My dish was really good. The sauce was just right. I liked how they had cherries and apricots in the dish to add some sweetness. My husbands dish was good he said but the chicken was a little to thin. He said it was like they pounded it like it was veal, but it just didn't work for that kind of chicken dish.   Overall, it wasn't the best food ever but it wasn't bad for it to be a late night meal.",

The waitstaff is incredibly attentive and friendly. They offer recommendations, however most importantly the food is cooked to perfection. I cannot tell you how much I love this place. As a local I try to avoid the strip as much as possible but the Venetian has free parking so I am more keen to go.

    "text": "This restaurant is pretty much like Cheesecake Factory, but not as good.  I believe they are sister companies.   I came here with a group of 6 other girls for brunch after a weekend of bachelorette festivities.  Here's what I shared with my sis who was the soon bride to be:  CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP This soup was quite tasty and definitely creamy! More on the creamy side than the vegetable taste but it's so good! I wish I only ordered this!  SHORT RIB GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH - $13.50 Slow roasted short rib, caramelized and picked onion, arugula and melted cheese, served on country bread. A plate you can share!  This crunchy and unctuous sandwich made also came with horseradish garlic sauce which really complimented it.  It also came with salad which I decided to have the cream of asparagus instead!  It's quite cheesy and greasy and all around good.  Although not the best grilled cheese I ever had, it was the greasy spoon I needed after a long weekend of drinking ;)   PASTA CARBONARA (lunch pasta & salad special) - $12.50 Smoked bacon, peas, a touch of garlic and karma dan cream sauce! We chose the twisted pasta instead of spegetti.  The pasta portion is HUGE! Definitely share-able.  although I had to ask for extra sauce because it didn't seam enough.  Overall this dish was okay :)  As for the salad, I'm glad it didn't taste like regular typical house salad.  It had dressing and a lot of the veggies that were decent.  My overall experience here was ok.  I feel we came here for convenience; it was in our hotel and we knew it had a variety of choices to eat.  Service was unfortunately weird although she was nice, there were a few mistakes and miscommunication  I guess.  Grand Lux is a place more for convenience than being part of the Vegas experience.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I constantly stay at the Venetian/Palazzo when I'm visiting Vegas so this has become one of my go-to places. It's convenient (right by the elevators to the suites), it's tasty, and it's open 24 hours. It really can't get any better than that!  I probably go to Vegas around once or twice a year so I rarely get to eat at Grand Lux (it's LA location unfortunately closed). Therefore, I always order the same thing when I go, which is the Pasta Telephono. I absolutely love it. It's got a nice tomato sauce, with melted cheese and bread crumbs on top. You can get the lunch portion which comes with a side salad ($12.95), but they only serve this until 5pm. The dinner portion costs $16.95. Kinda pricey for a pasta that doesn't even come with any meat. Adding chicken will cost you an additional $2, and they actually charge you per shrimp if you want to add that! I've never heard of a restaurant doing that before!  Anyways, I can't really comment much on their other dishes. I've tried a few others before and didn't have any complaints. They have a huge menu, including sandwiches/burgers, pizzas, and fried chicken, so you're bound to find something you like. It's very similar to Cheesecake Factory.",

    "text": "I usually stay at the Venetian and after a full day of traveling, the Grand Lux Cafe is the place to go. You'd figure with all the restaurants and snack kiosks around, why would someone visit the same restaurant twice? Well, first of all, it's the first restaurant you see walking out of your elevator... and also because they have great food at affordable prices.  They have three menus that rotate throughout the day. There's a morning (6 AM - 11 AM), a lunch (11 AM - 12 PM), and a late night (12 PM - 6 AM) menu. Each menu serves a variety of breakfast platters, sandwiches, burgers, and pasta dishes. There are two of the same restaurants somewhere in the area, so you have to check the hours cause I think one does close down for a few hours.  Oh one more word of advice, if you plan on eating there, call in and make a reservation, it gets pretty packed throughout the day!",

So much flavor, it was just perfection. And the creme brulee was just mouthwatering, it was the perfect finishing touch to send me to food coma.   But the service was honestly the best I'd had ever.  My server Mike was on top of filling our drinks and making sure we were satisfied!  And even the manager Matt, was making sure guests were happy and well taken care of.  Normally at restaurants you don't see manager's checking on their guests, But these two guys were on top of it the whole night. So shout out to you guys!  Most definitely will be back and will also recommend others to go :)",

We ordered the Bourbon Chicken and the Smothered Catfish. We modified the catfish dish and used the Bourbon chicken sauce and fried shrimp instead of sauteed shrimp. Husband loved the catfish. He called it heaven on a plate. Every bite was awesome. Our waiter: Jose Castaneda. If he's working make sure to ask for him. Hands down he was the most attentive, professional waiter and he made wonderful suggestions. Planning on coming back later tonight because the service Jose provided and the meal he helped us modify was the best we've had in Vegas. Thanks Jose!!!",

The service could be better. Our waiter took forever to refresh drinks and take our orders, which could be forgivable since the place was packed.

He did say the dinner portion was bigger. It was full of flavor though and I ate until I no longer could! The second time we came for breakfast and I ordered the biscuits and gravy, gravy on the side because I'm a total weirdo. The biscuits felt very heavy, but they were flaky and buttery! It also came with eggs and these delicious smashed potatoes! Some friends ordered the chilaquiles which I also got to try and they were AMAZING!!!!!!

(There's one fairly close to my place, but I've never gone --- for what that's worth.)  They offer chocolate chip/pecan cookies. In a box. Sounds good -- and they are. But, so ya know: Once we ordered them, the server told us it takes between 16 and 18 minutes. Verrrry specific. No problem. However, after not seeing them for, say, between 25 or 26 minutes later, I wondered what was going on...?  Meantime, my double espresso came, and that was just fine.   At last, the box o' cookies came and they were ..... pretty good. But only luke-warm. Now, of course, these babies have to cool. However, it's apparent they were ready, and cooled, and they simply didn't get delivered in a timely fashion. (Sigh) Not a deal-breaker, but certainly a bit of a let-down.  They are served in a handsome cardboard. And it's fun to take the rest with you. Just next time, I'd really love them coming out HOT!",

Not only are the portions HUGE, but the food is delish, there is a wide variety, and it is always quick.   For this particular visit, we were seated by Matt, the Senior Manager. On our way to the table he found out we were from the Bay Area and actually from the same home town - small world! I mentioned to a friend how bad my heartburn was and how I was dying for a glass of milk. Literally, within a mintue of being seated, Matt was back with a tall glass of milk for me, and I hadn't even asked for it! Awesome service! I let him know I actually prefer Non-Fat but I was so thankful I would drink whatever, he insisted on bringing me the non-fat. That pretty much set the pace for the rest of the visit.  We had the warm bread - Nom. The menu selection is so vast we each had something totally diff. I went for the Pasta Telephono = GREAT success. I was glad my friends weren't flying home so that they could bring my leftovers back, way too good to let go to waste. We had a great time refueling after a night at XS and a long day roaming the strip. Matt's hospitality was awesome, and he shared with us some of the other locations around the country that have other Grand Lux restaurants for us to visit.",

Somewhat brasserie in design with gold garnish and heavy fabrics plus a \"patio\" on the casino floor it was moments to seven on a Saturday morning that our trio was seated overlooking the Venetian's lingering late-night revelers alongside the morning check-outs and with immense menus soon perused selections were made - a sweet and gluttonous affair slow to arrive and marred by slow refills as staff seemed to be idling into shift change.  Admittedly more than a little puckish when plates were delivered nearly forty-five minutes later it was with relieved but bemused smiles that the three of us first laid eyes on the constituents of our $80 affair and although what was ordered would have been better suited for a half-dozen, the majority of it was worth the wait - an aggressively spiced carrot cake loaded with nuts plus shredded coconut and some of the thickest custard-drenched French Toast I've found both amongst the city's best.",

There was no wait and hardly anyone in the restaurant but service was sooo slow and our waitress seemed to be in la la land. We asked for water 3 times before she finally decided to bring it and then she just left us there for a good 15 minutes even though we told her we were ready to order when she brought the water.   We finally order and the food takes forever to arrive. By this time, we've gone through 2 bread baskets and our water but she doesn't come back to fill the water, just brings another one and doesn't answer our question about where the food is.   When the food finally arrived it was just ok. My friend got the waffles and I got the southwest enchiladas. It all looked good but the portions were huge and the food lacked flavor. We got through about half of it before deciding we were done and once we decided on that, the check took forever to arrive. *sigh*",

I never got the chance to eat in because I'm running around Vegas without that much time on my hands but there's a friendly, nice little take-out cafe right next to the entrance of the Grand Lux that I frequented!  Surprisingly, you can get a relatively good sandwich for $7 in this cafe. It is pre-made but none would be the wiser once you put it on a plate and ditched the wrapper. My gosh! I can't believe that I just got away with paying $7 for a sandwich in Vegas and it tastes relatively good?!  Also, the service here is not shabby at all. The girls that always help me are super nice and they take the time to make exceptions for me if needed and handle drunk people all night!

We knew we didn't want to eat at the cafe inside of T.I. because $15 for a plate of eggs is NOT okay.  I quickly Yelped somewhere for an early lunch and came across this place.  Since it's right across the street from T.I., we walked on over.  When we got there, I saw a line out the door and felt instantly defeated.  To my surprise, the line moved insanely fast and we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  The place is MASSIVE and it was packed.  Our server was sweet and competent and took our order promptly.  The food was amazing!  As an appetizer, we ordered a blue cheese salad-- lettuce coated with delicious blue cheese dressing, sprinkled with chunks of blue cheese, thick chunks of bacon, fresh croutons, and tomatoes.  To this day it remains the #1 salad we've ever eaten.  For our main courses, we had meatballs served on polenta and some kind of shrimp dish; both were perfect.  The price was extremely fair-- I'm sure each dish was right around what T.I.'s plate of eggs would have cost us, but obviously the food was above and beyond.  We had HAD plans to hit up several different Vegas eateries during our stay, but canceled those plans and ate at the Grand Lux for the rest of our meals-- dinner that same night and breakfast the next morning.  We talk about this place ALL OF THE TIME and can't wait to go back with our friends!  P.S. We HATE the Cheesecake Factory, so don't let their association deter you. =)",

Once you are there, seating options are inside the restaurant or at one of the tables that is out in the casino.   My only complaint from the trip was what I imagine to be the only complaint I would ever have with the Grand Lux, the iced tea was not very good. My dissatisfaction goes no further. In fact, from there my satisfaction actually grows rapidly.   I believe on the menu it is listed as Creamy Spinach and Cheese Dip...though more commonly Spinach and Artichoke dip...and it just might be the best I have ever had. The dip is served with plenty of tortilla chips, so you never have to worry about running out of things to dip, a problem I frequently encounter at other restaurants.   If you are familiar with the menus at The Cheesecake Factory, then you understand how overwhelmed you can feel at Grand Lux Cafe as well. So many items on the menu and they all sound good. There just aren't enough hours in the day for a menu like that, but you have to start somewhere.  I ordered the Fried Chicken. The meal I anticipated, a breast/thigh/leg with a side of mashed potatoes, would have been right for how hungry I was. The meal I got, a veritable mountain of chicken strips with a side of mashed potatoes, was a bit more than I could handle. I think the chicken was like $13-14. You cannot beat that.   Grand Lux has locations in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Chicago with two future locations of Garden City, NY and Sunrise, FL. At least in the cities where there are currently locations, there are so many restaurants and I always try to not go to the same place twice when I travel since there are so many options. I will have to fight to stick to that when I have the option to go back to Grand Lux Cafe. The place is even open 24 hours (in Las Vegas)!",

Other people in the group has the same experience with less quality than you'd expect for the price.  Overrated.",

I had a chicken and shrimp dish with ginger and curry, the sauce was great, chicken and shrimp satisfactory.

    "text": "I love this place.  Quality abounds.  It makes me smile when people write that the association with Cheesecake Factory is bad.  Why is that?  With Cheesecake, you are guaranteed a reasonable experience with good food, enormous portions, and competitive prices.  Grand Lux is no different, AND the restaurant has a better menu.    People love their star chefs and fancy restaurants.  Maybe they live in parts of the United States where access is difficult and cannot compare the LV versions to the originals.  In my experience, they are often poor renditions or ghosts if you will, of their original versions (e.g. Craftsteak MGM vs. NY, Daniel Wynn vs. NY, and Bouchon Venetian vs. Napa).   The quality of food and service doesn't translate to Las Vegas, and I think the majority of people agree with me here.  But you can't say the same thing with Grand Lux.  It is a super-sized version of the Cheescake Factory; same decor but with better service and seating.  Wait-time is low, and the food gets served rather quickly.  Food quality is what you've come to expect - moderate to high.   Grand Lux in the Palazzo is the best \"coffeeshop\" in a casino.",

It had chicken(would have better if the chicken was warm), Mango, red and yellow peppers(would have liked the pieces cubed and not in strips), it also macadamia nuts. The dressing was sweet and and deslish!! I also ordered a blood orange mimosa...SO GOOD!! I would come back for that alone!! They had a great selection on the whole menu..I plan to come back to try something else. Minor flaws but didnt take away from how delicious everything was.

It was basically a higher end version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles ... LOL.  Still yummy though especially with the added pecans :o)  My cousin Ha N. had the Seared Ahi Salad,  Anna had a mushroom burger and Phuong had a BLT.  All looked really tasty but i was pretty stuffed so i didn't have a bite of the burger or sandwich.  I did had a bite of salad to offset the lack of veggies for the weekend.  The Ahi was perfectly seared and fresh :o)  I can't believe i didn't save room for the creme brulee this time.  It's sooooo yummy here and made to perfection.  Now i'm a little sad :o( Not only did the Craps table at the Venetian take my money but i didn't have my creme brulee :o\\",

The service was great and super friendly. They have late night eating where most places stopped at 10 or 11 pm. The prices are decent, too. Apparently Cheesecake Factory owns this chain, too and I would definitely say I like their food much better than the CF. Also, a plus to that is that you can order CF cheesecake for dessert.  We went one morning for breakfast. I had blueberry pancakes - whcih were insanely delicious and my husband got the buffet. I believe the buffet was around $17 and he was particularly impressed with the soft waffles and chocolate chip toppings for them. (I took a few pics which I will upload)  The other menu items we tried were the ruebin, BLT, and chicken parm - all great!  We visited from Sun - Wed and never experienced a crowd or a wait. I'm sure that on the w/e that might be a different story.",

The menu is large almost too large that one will begin to question if they can make all that stuff well. The servers are pleasant but the kitchen takes for-freaking-ever.

So I ordered a pasta dish with marinera sauce and my hunny ordered something similar and the Grand Lux margarita (order it. it's dope).

I was super touched by that because he def couldve just done whatever he wanted being that it was peak lunch time and the place was hella crowded.   Thanks you guys!",

    "text": "I went here for a birthday dinner quite some time ago and while the wait was really long, the food was delish! It's owned by the same company as Cheesecake Factory, so there are some things that are very similar between the two (except the price). It is a little pricier than Cheesecake Factory which isn't far from here at all, but everything that my party ordered was worth it. The portions are pretty big, so it's definitely a restaurant you can share a plate even with a very hungry man lol. I ordered the Sunday night past which had this divine meat sauce that had short ribs in it, beef, garlic over spaghetti and also the mashed potato spring rolls appetizers which are just as good as they sound. All in all we had a good time and the only things I took off for were the really long wait, the fact that there wasnt anything special done for birthdays, and everything bein a little more on the expensive side for a \"cafe\".",

Instead of hitting buffets or Denny's after a late night or daytime after the pool, try this place. ;-)",

I ordered the chicken and waffles, I asked for dipping sauce and it took him so long to bring it, I nearly finished all my strips before he brought it too me. I'm usually not the one to complain or petty about situations but the restaurant was not even full. In my opinion it was unacceptable service. I'm just giving credit where it is due.",

But based on their Sunday Night Pasta, I HAVE to give this restaurant 5 stars. It's amazing. The braised beef chunks are tender and tasty, the meat sauce is perfect (not too overwhelming), and the spaghetti noodles are nice and buttery. This dish is neither too heavy nor too light, and the portions are generous, enough for two people. I highly recommend this dish, and I would be willing to go back and try other things. Additionally, the prices are reasonable as compared to similar restaurants (the Sunday Night Pasta was $18).",

It's definitely like a Cheesecake Factory, from the large variety of menu items to the decor. Our server was really friendly.  I got the Garlic Shrimp Pasta and my boyfriend got the Carolina BBQ Sandwich. Garlic Shrimp Pasta was close to $20 but so worth it. It's saucy once you stir it all together and the shrimp was good and completely peeled. It looks like the sauce would be light but it actually tastes pretty heavy/creamy so I didn't eat a whole lot. I took like 2/3 of it as leftovers. My boyfriend really enjoyed his sandwich. It came with extra cole slaw on the side which he liked and the french fries were good; slightly crispy. He also took half his sandwich home too.   Overall, we enjoyed the meal here and would come back if we're feeling different types of food since the variety is great here. It's casual, has lots of seating, and gets you full!",

They've got a large selection of your typical American food here from burgers to sandwiches to salads. I've gotten their breakfast plates to go and it's good. The eggs are fluffy, their bacon is crisp and the bread has just enough butter on it. Their sandwiches are good too. The fries do taste like they were frozen at one point and came out pretty soggy but the sandwich itself wasn't bad. They do get super packed during the day so I'd say if you're looking for food during the day, go explore something that's special to Las Vegas like Brgr or Steak or eat at a buffet. Save this place for late night food when you come back from gambling or a night out on the strip.",

We found the space in between a little too dividing so we pushed the tables together.  Why didn't they give us a table big enough for everyone is beyond me (this place is huge so I'm assuming they have a table for 11 somewhere and if they don't, they need to make one like we did). The menu was extensive - very similar to cheesecake factory both in number of dishes offered and the types of dishes offered.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say the two are affiliated.    The portions of the food are large! Definitely big enough for two.  So if you don't want left overs or don't want to fall into a food coma, you should definitely share.  So kuddos on the portions.  The service, however, could have been a lot better.  It took almost an hour for us to get our food which is way too long for some pasta and sandwiches - I could cook faster than that at home so I expect your commercial kitchen to do better.  I also thought our server was slow and unattentive.  We hardly saw him and when we did, he would try to just fly by our table - hardly ever checking up on us.  And when we'd ask him for things, he'd take forever to bring it.  Not pleased with the service at all but the food was solid - hence the 3 stars.",

Everyone makes mistakes, but this one didn't bode well. After ordering, the waitperson left so quickly when I hadn't finished and had to turn all the way around to ask her to come back. The chairs were covered in crumbs and one was wet. Obviously no one bothered to clean the seats. The benches are old, flattened, and cracked. The floor is covered in so much slippery grease that our feet and chairs were sliding around while eating. This is extraordinary-we've never dined at any restaurant and had this level of grime and filth on the ground. It's a shame, because the Cafe Beef Wellington was unbelievably delicious. Puffy airy pastry, tender melt in your mouth beef medallions. Maybe I can get them to go next time, to avoid the unpleasant experience of trying to eat while my chair slides around underneath me.",

We stayed at the Platinum Hotel [awesome] but needed a late night eatery that wasn't Denny's or Micky D's.   We were all very satisfied with Grand Lux because they have a late night menu that consists of breakfast food, salads, soups, appetizers, pastas and even plain greasy pizza.   We had 8 hungry girls that had just gone through a long day of driving, surprising our bachelorette, and some car trouble. The Grand Lux that night was like heaven to us. We ate heartily, and then crashed.   Some of the things we got:  Seared Ahi Tuna Salad Mushroom Pizza Eggs, sausage, bacon with toast Omelettes",

My bf got the Chicken Parmesan and he is still talking about it days after we ate there. I got the Pasta Fresca which I normally wouldn't have ordered but I was feeling extra crappy because of a bug I caught and didn't want to eat any meat, so it was perfect for me at the time. I would definitely go back. Too bad they don't have one in SF.   Good food for a decent price at a place you wouldn't expect it - at the Venetian!",

They have the same decor and the same overwhelming menu with chefs that do nothing spectacular but do a little bit of everything mediocre.    Same story with my latest visit.  I had the pasta carbonara and the sauce was good, a bit bland and the pasta was a bit overcooked.  However, the bf LOVED the fried spring rolls that you roll in lettuce.  Kinda a hybrid between egg rolls and lettuce wraps.  I have to admit, it was good.  Weird part.  I made a friend at my table.  There was a little ant crawling around.  He wanted some of my pasta and since I didn't finish it myself, I gave him some.  Sadly, he drowned in the oil.    Anyway, on to desserts.  Their desserts give them a one up on cheesecake.  I love their strawberry shortcake along with their beignets.",

And delicious. For appetizers, we ordered these deep fried potato egg rolls (~$9), smothered in cheddar cheese and bacon pieces. With a side of sour cream. I wanted to die, each bite was filled with potato-ey, cheesy, crunchy goodness.   Hubby ordered the shrimp scampi ($20) and I got the Sunday night pasta (~$16). We only ate about a quarter of it before getting filled up.   Like I mentioned, the service was impeccable and seating was quick. Total win-win for Vegas at rush hour. This will be our new go-to lunch place! Or maybe even dinner...",

During our stays at the Venetian, we ventured out to try different restaurants in this hotel but this place has them all beat. You can't go wrong with the burgers/sandwiches and fries. Their burger buns are really good. I recommend the spicy carnitas sandwich - slow cooked pork with avocado, cilantro, and salsa made to perfection! Also, the jambalaya is delicious and the lunch portion is more than enough food.   The customer service is great. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Also, the waiting time for this restaurant is never more than 10 mins. It's a large place and it's run very efficiently.   This place is probably the best restaurant on this side of the strip. Definitely recommend you try it out for yourself",

Instead, they came up with a concept for a new restaurant, and bam, you've got Grand Lux Cafe.  The menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory's, better actually, so if you like CF, you'll love Grand Lux Cafe. I've never ordered anything here that I've disliked. It's definitely the best 24 hour restaurant I've ever been to.  The food is delicious, the prices are right, the service is always great, and I love the ambiance. Take my advice, if you're going to eat at a hotel and you're on a budget, eat here! Our group ate at the Caesars Palace food court (Cypress Street, check out my review), and we ended up paying the same, if not more than Grand Lux Cafe, and the food at GLC, is 10 times better!",

My favorite is the Sunday night pasta, where they take short rib bits, sausage, steak, and other \"leftovers\" and mix it into their sauce.

Super tender and delicious. Awesome recommendation, awesome food, awesome service. I am a fan. Next time I am in Vegas and close to Venetian, I might drop by again.   My friends ordered pastas.

If you've seen ground turkey or veggie patty, that's how this burger was made.  And whatever was used to keep it altogether, was awesome!  My friend had the pasta dish but it was a bit dry.  Perhaps eating at 330am would be one of the reasons for dry pasa?  I don't know...but I would stick with the burgers at those times.  I even had breakfast and was happy to see that their food was consistently good overall and went back to have another burger the next day.  At a casino cafe, don't expect great service nor fast.  However, the staff at this location was efficient, quick, and tried to get to all customers as quick as possible.  This location has a better setup than the Palazzo so if you were like me and stayed at the Palazzo, perhaps stay at the Venetian (shorter walk) and open 24/7.    I ate at the Palazzo location and the mushroom burger is the same at both but as for the rest of the food, you'll have to be the judge.  I plan to try the LA location of this establishment.

The first day, the service was alright -- a little slow, but not bad. Everything was going well until my boyfriend found something nice and crispy in his nachos... Green onion? Nope. Charred meat? I guess not. Oh, what was this -- a TOOTHPICK?! Holy moly, that could have been lodged into his throat if he didn't catch that sooner. We complained, got the dish taken off the bill. All was well.  Day two. Now, this was crazy. We got some slightly creepy server named Valerie(?), who took forever to get us water. We must have waited 15 minutes maybe, and then we asked again for water, and she tried to blame it on the bus boy. Um, girl, he's a bus boy, not your water wench, so please, after several years of experience in the restaurant industry, if I was that waitress, I would have gotten my table water right away. That's pretty much a given in any restaurant. Even horrible-service Chinese restaurants give you water faster. And then my blueberry pancakes were blueberry-less... so I had to ask for blueberries, which came on the side. BAH.   The food here is just okay... I was just reading that review before mine that says that this is Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant... and I believe it. The Cheesecake Factory is not too great, and neither is this place. It's just well-priced with decently large portions, but it tries to cater to a variety of palates, and I think it tried a little too hard. If you're coming here during a stay at the Venetian, I will say one thing -- it's convenient, and if you're not that hungry and willing to wait a million years for just alright food, then it's all good.",

It's very convenient that the Venetian Lux is 24 hours, and it was located right next to the elevators to our room. We decided to share some appetizers for our late night snack. We ordered the Fried Calamari and the Lettuce wraps. I have eaten at Lux before and liked what I ordered the last time we were here but this time I was just kinda meh. The Lettuce wraps were just ok, the filling was a bit too salty. The fried calamari was ok, it also had shrimp in it, I thought it was decent but I know it didn't sit well with my GF. Within 30 minutes after we left, my GF had to make a deposit at the Wynn and it was not a cash deposit. We think it might have been the dipping sauce. Overall it was just ok, can't really complain too much as it's really convenient they are open 24 hours. I like their breakfast a lot better and will be back for that in the future.",

They accidentally brought us the wrong sandwich, but they rectified it within 2 minutes.  It was the best and fastest service we had in Vegas.  Got the turkey club and a strawberry shortcake.  The sandwich was delicious, but the strawberry shortcake was amazing.  Best shortcake I have ever had - combined with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and fresh strawberries.  We will definitely be going back for another dessert.",

    "text": "I was wary to come here because of its Cheesecake Factory association, and my wanting to try something new in Vegas.  We had to catch the Wayne Brady show in the Venetian (excellent btw), however, so we stopped here beforehand.  It was a less than 5 minute wait at around 6 pm on a Monday (no reservations unless more than 7 people).  The menu is marginally different from Cheesecake Factory.  The restaurant itself is huge, and has better decor than the Factory (or was it that I was used to gaudiness since I was in Vegas?).  What I tried: Indochine Chicken and Shrimp:  I tried to get my bf not to order this because I figure we shouldn't go \"ethnic\" at a non-ethnic restaurant.  I'm glad he went ahead and ordered it anyway.  I suppose Indochine is a social construct/concept anyway, and not really ethnic... ok back to the food.  It was a good!  A bit sweet for my taste, but definitely way better than I expected. Creamy Chicken Soup:  Yum yum, how can you go wrong with soup?  My boyfriend, the mojito addict, ordered 2 of them for $11 each.  That's more than they charge at the Factory, just to let you know.  Basically, this place was better than any Cheesecake Factory I'd ever been to, but I think they overcharge for their drinks.  For what it was though, this is a 4-star.  Props for being open 24 hours.",

Famished beyond belief and very dehydrated, we arrived ready to eat!  I ordered the chicken and waffles, expecting the best chicken and waffles of my life because the menu description made it sound ritzy.  Honestly, it was disgusting -- dry chicken coated in batter that was still gooey inside, a flavorless dry waffle, and synthetic tasting syrup and melted butter.  Even I in my disorganized stupor could not allow myself to finish this meal.  You're MUCH better off at Denny's in the early morning.",

The was another family waiting ahead of us and we pretty much just stood there for about 15 mins until I had to stop a server and ask him how long the wait was. He said I don't know I don't know how to run the computer.  Awesome I asked if he can ask the hostess he says yeah, anyway we were seated after 30 mins of waiting and being my first time I did not know they have complimentary bread but when I told the server if we get any complimentary bread she says its upon request. Well how would I know whether or not you have complimentary bread. Atleast asking us if it was our first Time here or not would have helped. When the manager brought our food I told him that the service so far is horrible.  He did not apologize for the wait and for the hostess not letting us know how long the wait is and for the bread he said That is why it's upon request. Yah if I knew that I wouldn't have asked! ITS MY FIRST TIME HERE. The server had the same answer. Obviously if the manager himself has such poor customer service, you caNnot blame the servers. The food was ok nothing special. And I have a big mouth, if I like a place I will go telling everybody because I have a saloon and a lot of contact with people but I will make sure I tell everyone about this horrible service I received and wouldn't recommend it to Anyone.",

I kept wondering why this one dude looked so familiar (I don't have many --ie: any-- black friends who are uber muscular and good looking). AND THEN IT HIT ME. It was AP! In the flesh!  Sadly, all my excited whispering to my friends (\"OMG ITS AP!!!\") yielded only blank stares (\"AP? Who's that? A rapper?\"). I was less than 10 ft away from Mr. Butterfingers himself, Adrian Peterson, and none of my friends understood my excitement. :(    I'm still upset I didn't get a photo with one of the best RBs in the NFL (and complete my collection of pics w/ Viking RBs).

We scored a great seat on the outside patio - perfect for people watching.  It was breakfast time, so we ordered Bloody Marys, which we loved it because it was kick in your pants spicy!  I was looking for something savory AND sweet on the menu like a Denny's Grand Slam, but surprisingly, Grand Lux didn't offer anything like that.  So I ended up just getting the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting and added a side of eggs.  These pancakes were basically red velvet cupcakes, but flattened lol.  Julius had the chicken and waffles, which he thought were good, but preferred the soul food variety (ie regular instead of Belgian waffles, and chicken wings & drumsticks instead of just strips.)  Our food did arrive much later than everyone else's around us, and the manager was nice enough to come by to apologize.  He should've comped one of Julius' beers though, dammit!  So Grand Lux Cafe is pretty laid back and traditional (it's like the Cheesecake Factory's granny!)  If we could give it 3.5 stars, we would!",

My boyfriend ordered a 7&7 and after taking a big gulp he realized there were probably about 50-75 bugs floating in it!   How the hell could this happen? I have no idea- but I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a horrible mishap and carry on (ASSUMING THERE WOULD BE COMPENSATION AND AN APOLOGY OF SOME SORT). We'll I assumed wrong. We went on with our dinner (I got the Gnocchi which was inedible and aside from all of that, I had dried food on the inside of my glass).   Got the bill and we were charged for everything. Our server was very nice and sent the manager over. This guy, however, was a joke. He was extremely defensive and rude. He was annoyed by the entire thing and gave a lot of attitude. I'm sorry but I just drank BUGS ate YOUR restaurant. You could at least comp ONE beverage. He grumbled, walked away without saying anything to us to resolve it. Later the server brought us back our check with the bug drink taken off.   I would recommend this place if you like extra protein in your drinks :)",

    "text": "I actually like the Grand Lux Cafe. The service and the food is good in Beverly Hills. I ordered food to go at the Venetian location. I arrived in Vegas for Halloween before my friends so I grabbed something to eat. The buffalo chicken bites are always a treat! The disappointment was the large bag of old fries and the BLT - the bacon was clearly cooked long before. As the main meat of the sandwich the bacon should be hot and fresh that's why people who like bacon eat it. Anyway, I sent the fries back and received more hot ones but A I was scared to eat them and B they just weren't good fries. I didn't eat the BLT sandwich. It would've gone to waste if my bud wasn't starving when she got to the room and ate it. I guess ordering to go is the mistake.",

Grand Lux sat us in their back room which was a really nice atmosphere and they dedicated 3 servers to us, which was a big plus!  So many times restaurants will only commit one server to a large group which only leads to delays and dissatisfaction.  If you have to plan a large group dinner, I highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe.  The food is amazing, the prices are extremely reasonable, and they don't require any of that deposit/contract nonsense when you try to book for a large group.  Plus they are open 24 hours a day so you can book for whatever time of the day.",

I'm loving the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, crab cakes, burgers, and salads here. It's just like Cheesecake Factory (I believe they're under the same ownership) so it'll be similar quality of food. The waiter that we had was absolutely fabulous too! He was just quirky and funny, exactly what we need during this time to keep us awake! He was super attentive and paid attention to alot of details. Love this place, especially since they have comfy booths and tables to sit after a long night of standing/dancing!",

I've been here multiple times with large groups and smaller groups and its very convenient for both.  The last time I was here, we had a group of 10.  It was a great choice for dinner since none of us could stomach a buffett.      I ordered the BBQ chicken which came with cornbread and cole slaw.

We wrote our name at 4:00 am and were seated around 4:10 am However our server did not come to our table till 4:20 am and we did not receive our food till 5:00 am. I had a feeling that this place will be busy since it is open 24 hours but it was not even that packed. I liked their decor - as my fellow yelpers said it give a Cheesecake factory vibe. It was little too dark in there however.  Since it was too late and I was itching to go to bed, I ordered a side of hash-brown potatoes. They were not even fully cooked. I could still taste the cold hash browns. It seemed like they just threw it on the stove and bought it out in less than 10 minutes. I forced myself to eat them without complaining much because I was too tired and our server was actually nice. He was an older talkative gentleman and sharing his stories with us. I like the location because we stayed at The Palazzo and since Venetian and Palazzo are inter-connected I could literally walk back to our room without going out on the streets.   I feel like if I would like to give this place another try again by going there around brunch time and ordering one of their brunch plates.",

You had your choice to sit on the side of the dining area to basically people watch or inside the restaurant for a more intimate meal which is what we chose. This restaurant is open 24/7 which we loved because we could then have an actual meal at 3 am after some gambling. The prices couldn't be beat because they averaged about $20-$30 an entree which isn't bad for being in Vegas compared to some restaurants. Will definitely be back on our next visit to the Venetian.",

We decided to sit at the bar since it was open, and the bartender was very nice and friendly, and didn't blink an eye when we didn't order alcohol, and the food was very good! What we did not appreciate, however, was the two other female bartenders who openly complained about their coworkers, had bad attitudes, and seemed inconvenienced by us being there. Very unprofessional!",

I ordered the Sicilian pasta and my boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie - each were around 14-15 dollars (if I remember correctly). We realllllly enjoyed both dishes - and somehow we were too full to finish, but we tried our best. The portions were quite big. What I liked about it was how the atmosphere was nice and classy, but the dining style was pretty casual and the food felt homey - with portions that were bigger than we expected!   I would come here again :)",

Fair warning, it must be shared, because it is simply too rich and amazing to enjoy by yourself. I ate one slice and I was satisfied. I even had it cold during a midnight snack and it was still good. Then I ate it again the following morning lol. My boyfriend had the chilaquiles which were alright but he's also mexican and  knows what chilaquiles should taste like. But everyone knows not to order a mexican dish at an american establishment. So dont order it!",

I got the steak sandwich and it was probably half the size of what I expected, came with a side of fries, food itself tasted decent and I was actually full from my small sandwich but nothing to rave about.   it's a great place to stop by if you're on a budget and just need to grab some food, but it's not by any means fancy or nice, or good tasting for that matter.",

Main courses were just average. Started with Buffalo chicken rolls and potato rolls, both of them were probably the best food we had. Southwestern Salad was 6/10, Bourbon Chicken 7/10 and the truffle pasta with mushrooms and chicken 5/10. I wish i didn't add extra chicken in my pasta because chicken was very dry . On the other hand, our server was very kind and tried to do her best like all other workers in the restaurant. Overall, best part of this place is the wide selection of food they serve and being open 24 hours.",

Staying in this part of the strip, my pals and I are always looking for a quick bite in a sit-down restaurant and we haven't found anything as tasty and convienient as the Grand Lux.  Even if the line is long the wait is usually less than 15 minutes.  The menu is huge and there should be something for everybody.  The portions are big and the food served pretty quickly.  The place is huge too!  It must hold hundreds of diners.   My only complaint is having to navigate through the people-movers, escalators and stairs in the front of the Venetian.",

    "text": "I was surprised to find out the Grand Luxe was a chain restaurant tied with Cheesecake Factory.  I personally don't care for Cheesecake Factory so this was a pleasant surprise that their menu vastly differs from their counterpart.  Their menu was pages and pages in length.  I wanted to order so many items!  Staying at the Palazzo in December had led us (6 girls) not want to venture out much in the cold and just dine in primarily The Palazzo or the Venetian.  It so happened that we ended up here for both breakfast/lunch and dinner this past trip.  For breakfast/lunch they offer lunch specials for a reasonable price and from the looks of what my friends ordered, the portions seem filling to the point of having leftovers.  After a night of drinking, I always crave soup.  My friend mentioned pho earlier and we read the zen noodles description which sounded like pho so I thought to give it a try.  It tasted similar to pho, but lacking flavor.  It did come with chili, basil, and bean sprouts.  It did the job and hit te spot- and was enjoyable.  For dinner, I had an ahi appetizer which was fantastic.  It tasted very fresh and was accompanied by 3 types of salad: carrot, cucumber, and bean sprouts.  The cucumber and bean sprout salads were delish but the carrot salad really didn't have much flavor.  I could say that I enjoyed both my meals and that I wouldn't mind coming back.  On the other hand, some of my friends cared to disagree.  For lunch, my friend wanted a pickle to add to her sandwich but they said they didn't have pickles.  Not a big thing to me, but this displeased my friend.  For dinner when we came back, they had 2 soups of the day: cream of chicken and clam chowder.  3 of my friends ordered the clam chowder and maybe 20 minutes into waiting, the manager had to come up to our table to apologize and say they ran out of clam chowder.  What a disappointment to hear that the chowder was the special but they didn't have any left because they ran out of clams.  On both lunch and dinner meals, service was lacking.  It took at least 20-30 minutes+ wait for food.  Water was scarce and so was the waiter.    Food was good but questionable if worth the service/wait....",

    "text": "This a great place to have a meal in vegas if you are not looking for a high dollar adventure meal and want to stay in the $15-30/person range but still get good food and full tablecloth service with something for everyone. Grand Lux is a small chain with restaurants in places like Miami and Houston, a deluxe version of the Cheesecake Factory with a giant menu including European, American, and International Fare. The smoothies are good. They have lots of sandwiches and pasta and breakfast all day and mexican and practically everything else. This place is giant and actually has two locations in this casino. The location is nice. I think it may be the original for the chain. You will have a more unique experience perhaps if you spend $60/person at a fine dining place on the strip but you cannot do that every night and Grand Luxe is great food for the price (especially for the strip) and everything will be quite good. For a similar price you can visit one of the many trendy diners in the strip casinos but not get the whole tablecloth experience and you will end up with more fried food and less sides and variety. You can also go to a buffet but that will be a bad move, as the food quality will be lower than Grand Luxe, and you will end up too full when Grand Luxe would definitely have offered more than enough food anyway without the temptation to eat 3 plates of low quality food to get your value.",

Their fettuccini alfredo is pretty bomb & so are their buffalo chicken rolls and cream of chicken soup!  Never disappoints! Also, don't be fooled by the long lines, especially if you are a small party, just go and sit at the bar! There is almost always bar spots available to eat, despite people wanting to sit at regular tables, and I honestly feel like the bartenders are more attentive anyways!  Pricing here is slightly above average, but nothing mediocre. You are looking at $10-$25 plates.  Love this place! Can't wait til our next visit and meal here!",

For the Sunday night pasta it comes with perfectly made spaghettini and marinated short rib that literally melts when chewing. For the burger melt it's one of the best patty melts I've had with the caramelized onions and thousand island sauce to go with the thick juicy beef patty and parmesan cheese bread. Man, I'm drooling right now just dreaming about it.",

    "text": "After walking the strip to find a breakfast place without a ridiculous wait on a Saturday morning we stumbled upon Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian. The wait was only 15 minutes and our waiter was incredibly courteous, knowledgeable and fast. They were offering a brunch buffet, and you could also order off of the menu. I ordered a mimosa and Eggs Benedict with hashbrowns. Everything was delicious and the eggs were cooked perfectly! The hollandaise was perfectly lemony and not salty - the menu said that it was \"the best\", and I can definitely see why. My boyfriend ordered the DeLux Breafast Sandwich (scrambled Eggs, bacon, ham, grilled tomato and havarti cheese on grilled brioche bread) and he said it was Awesome! Another plus - the prices were pretty good, given that it was Las Vegas. I would definitely come back here for brunch!",

The restaurant entrance is at the Venetian casino in the back. We walked in and waited 5 minutes because no one was in the front and then we got seated. The waiter took a while to come and get or order and took a while  to just get water.   My bf got a lunch special which is the miso salmon, white rice and mushroom and vegetable side. It was really good!  I got clam linguini. It looked good but it didn't taste good. It was bland and oily. I had to ask our waiter who took forever... (the staff like disappeared when i was looking for them.... no one was around) for some parmesan and red pepper flakes... i had to literally flavor the linguini with the parmesan which has a salty flavor and red pepper flakes to give it some flavor.  So, this place interiorly looks nice but their food and service needs improvement and the price is moderate. But, I am willing to try another dish (in LA) because this place is related to Cheesecake Factory and I think their food is good but I just had a bad dish.",

    "text": "Summary: Fantastic!  Better than I remembered of the one in Beverly Hills.  Great food, selection, service, and value.  Nothing to complain about; only compliments.  My buddy and I were in town for CES and in need of a no-reservations-needed dinner at around 8pm on a Friday.  I had been to the Beverly Hills Grand Lux numerous times in years past and always enjoyed it, but it never really stood out as a great restaurant to me.  When I called this Grand Lux there was no wait time, so we made our way there from Caesar's and were immediately seated.  We ordered a couple of drinks (I ordered the house Chardonnay, which was by Beringer and was a great deal at $7 and really good), looked over the menu and decided to share a few items.  The three we chose were:  Short rib sliders - Four little sliders on brioche buns, stuffed with super tender and flavorful braised short rib and topped with a creamy horseradish sauce.  Fantastic!  Avocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger - A pretty massive cheeseburger.  Messy and kind of hard to eat, but with delicious ingredients.  A nice kick, too.  Spicy Carnitas Sandwich - An excellent mix of textures and flavors.  Crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside.  A great sauce was provided with this one and it was delicious.  Each of the entrees came with a side salad, so for around $35 we had a great quality meal and were satisfied with the quantity of food, too.  Can't recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "I heard about Grand Lux Cafe through a few friends, and I am very surprised I have never heard of it before (considering there is a HUGE location right in Chicago that I passed by yesterday). But anyway, I decided to check it out as our last lunch/meal in Vegas before we had to board the shuttle. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the rush of people on the streets was insane, so it took us a good 20 minutes or so to get to the Venetian. I love that hotel so much - so gorgeous, but we didn't have any time to explore, so we rushed over to the Grand Lux (very easy to find) and got seated right away. It's a very big restaurant, with plenty of seating and a very \"grand\" and beautiful interior, but it was PACKED!   With the little time that we had left, my boyfriend and I rushed through the menu and he ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Rolls and I got the Spicy Flat bread Chicken sandwich - very good! My only concern was that the food took forever, so we literally had 10 minutes to eat and we had to go right away. The doggy bag came into good use when our plane was delayed for 5 hours...   Anyway, this place reminds me so much of Cheesecake Factory, but that makes a lot of sense considering it's the same owners. With that being said, the menu is endless, so I will def be making my way back here next time I am in Vegas. I LOVE the fact that it is 24/7, and I wish I knew that when I was there Fri night around 4 am when we were starving and everything around Cosmo had closed.   Service was good, but like I said, the food took way too long. I'd recommend this location and though it's a chain, the prices are very reasonable and there is def something on the menu for everyone.",

The buffet was small, but had everything one would want at breakfast. (Eggs, ham/sausage/bacon, hash browns, waffles, fruit, pastries, cereal, breads, etc)   All of the food seemed fresh and of a higher caliber than your typical Vegas buffet.

Here's what you need to know  1)  Great spot any time of day - pretty awesome in the middle of the night 2)  Their food is exceptional - if you're drunk/hungover/about to pass out... whatever.  Just don't expect it to taste like the dish you're served once you get to heaven then you'll be disappointed. 3)  Yes, the line will look intimidated - but calm down... you'll be seated in 10-15 mins. 4)  I literally ate here every meal during my stay at the Venetian a couple weeks back.  20% out of convenience and 70% because of the good food. 5)  It's not expensive... especially for Vegas  Good stuff:  Whatever the hell those mashed potatoes wrapped in an egg roll are called  The miso cod - had it for lunch and dinner with the mashed potatoes instead of rice.  It's really good  Their volcano shrimp  The corned beef hash - my bf actually exclaimed \"this is real meat!\" when he got it  My least favorite was the Ahi tuna salad but it was still good (and I'll admit, it's a hard dish to pull off if you're not a sushi restaurant).

I am a devoted follower! While staying at the Venetian this restaurant became my favorite stop every single day. Like Vegas, it's open 24 hours a day so whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or you're completely sloshed at 3 am, the Grand Lux will be there welcoming you with open arms.   If you've never been to the Grand Lux it is essentially an upgraded Cheesecake Factory with a slightly different menu. Same 471 page food and drink menu which takes a good 30 minutes to read through. My favorite thing to order is the pot roast with mashed potatoes as I like to pretend that June Cleaver is my mother and she's whipped me up a beautiful meal.   My last memory of the Grand Lux Cafe is actually the inability to remember eating there. I woke up in my hotel room after a crazy night of clubbing for my friend's bachelorette party and groaned out loud:   Me: \"I'm soooo hungry! When are we going eat?\" My girlfriend: \"How can you be so hungry? You ate so much at Grand Lux!\"  Me: \"We didn't eat at Grand Lux Cafe last night.\"  My girlfriend: \"Uh yes we did, you had two strawberry waffles and a pot roast.\"  Me: \"What?! And I don't remember a thing!\" (Slaps hand to forehead) Me: \"Want to go there again for breakfast?\" My girlfriend: (Slaps hand to forehead)  Yelp 365 Challenge: #173/365 (The Forgotten Meal)",

The choices were classic and flavorful, but this should not be your first choice if you are looking to embrace the all-u-can-eat mentality.  They have an omelet station with excellent fresh ingredients, they have an assortment of breads, danishes, meats (all pork based) and the phenomenal fruit.  There is also an egg and potato selection.  We were not disappointed by any of our choices.  The only downside is the buffet area is small and quite congested so it felt a bit rushed.  However, it was a great way for us to start our day...and the full bar in the restaurant allows you to jump start your party!",

    "text": "A truly pleasant surprise considering when you enter Grand Lux in Yelp it comes up with the option to find \"closest locations.\"  The Palazzo was closest casino to our hotel so we gave in and ate here after giving up trying to find the Canyon Ranch Grill.  Despite the 5 - 6 minute wait to get a table, the stock tables and aging decor led us to grimly await a pretty mediocre experience...  Not so.  We visited during shift change but both our waiters were friendly and attentive.  They placed us right by the fence that separates the dining room from the casino so we could people watch.    We ordered the Protein Breakfast for a brow raising $13.95 and a Southwest Omelette.  I couldn't touch the omelette because it had sour cream on top and inside but the egg white and chicken were great for something so plain.  We split the hash browns which were absolutely perfect and I shared my tomatoes and asparagus.    Just over $30 with tip for breakfast which seems to be the Vegas average for a meal.  Those cheap Vegas getaways are gone for good.  I give a speech about this, but I won't.  :)",

Off the breakfast menu, I tried the fruit bowl and some coffee. Not much to write home about on a fruit bowl. During dinner they serve warm bread and butter while you wait. I tried the chicken salad sandwich is pretty good but I need to add a little salt. I didn't care for the fries. I've also tried the short rib grilled cheese sandwich -- also good. The Asian pear martini was good but I don't think that it is $14 good.  From the dessert menu, I ordered the red velvet cake. A nice size dense slice of cake, really enough for 2 people.  We never had a wait long to be seated, service was quick and the servers were polite for the most part. Overall, the experience and food were okay and I would dine here again (but not order any drinks) if they are convenient.",

Friendly staff & good for kids when the sun is still up.   Like everyone says-- it IS like a Cheesecake Factory minus the cheesecake, but in my opinion and if I'm willing to make the drive out here, I like it better!   This time around the better half and I had : Blue Cheese Salad - not a blue cheese fan but this was good, could have a little less dressing Calamari - FAVORITE! I liked the added fried zucchini and onions!  Kobe Meatballs - big meatballs, juicy and tender meatballs! Not too much sauce, comes on a bed of creamy polenta.  I unfortunately could not have any of the pasta dish but it did look good!   Must try if you're in the strip area!",

    "text": "I've visited this spot several times over the last few years when I come to Vegas for a convention. Food is always reliably amazing. Churro french toast is not to be missed (huge portion, but they'll bag some of it for takeaway if you can't finish it) and the eggs any style with hash brown and bacon are also delicious.  This time, I've come for breakfast both yesterday and today, around 10am.  Since I finished my breakfast around 11 and it was kind of quiet, I took out my laptop to work for a bit, in agreement with my fabulous waitress Maria who told me it was not an issue until they change shift at midday.  At midday yesterday I moved out to one of the high tables in the waiting-before-being-seated area, where I stayed until 13:45, without any issues. Today, not even 3 minutes after I took out my laptop, the on-duty manager (who goes by Bobby but apparently is called Rene) came to tell me I needed to vacate my table.  I told him I'd checked with my waitress and that it was ok, he said no working or meetings are allowed in the Grand Lux Cafe. I asked whether he was kicking me out 5 minutes after I finished my breakfast, and he said I'd been there for an hour and a half (not True, it wasn't even 1h15) and that he had a queue waiting to get in and needed to use it (not True either, there was absolutely no one waiting in the waiting area). At this time, 25 minutes after I vacated my table, it hasn't been occupied yet. I'm not naive, I know they want high turnover ratio to maximise business, but if you can't allow a customer to stay for an extra half an hour to 45 minutes after she's asked politely and you have nobody waiting to be seated, you certainly have no clue what customer service is.",

All my L.A. natives are still heartbroken over the sudden and untimely closure of the Beverly Center location.  Lucky enough there is a location that is open 24/7 4 hours away in Las Vegas on the strip inside the Venetian, a hotel best known for the Grand Canal Shoppes and the popular Tao nightclub.  During my time here in Las Vegas I decided to eat here with a friend as one of my birthday dinner stops.  As far as drinks are concerned, my friend ordered a mojito while I ordered a blood orange mimosa.  For our entree we ordered a Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya in addition to BBQ glazed salmon.  As usual the food was delicious and what I would expect out of a restaurant of such nature.  If you like the Cheesecake Factory then you'll LOVE the Grand Lux.  An excellent choice for dining in a chic hotel like the Venetian.  For me personally Grand Lux is a MUST for most of my trips to Vegas!!",

My friend and I were pretty hungry so we went with the Grilled Steak Sandwich and the Avocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger.  Both came with fries and coupled with their yummy complimentary bread, the food was more than enough to fill us up.  I really enjoyed my steak sandwich.  The meat was very juicy and tender, while the arugula and tomatoes gave the sandwich a refreshing quality.  My friend completely took down his cheeseburger so I know he enjoyed it.  Also the complimentary bread they started us off with was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Served with soft butter, it was a pleasant addition to our overall meal.  I would definitely eat here again.",

We were staying at the Venetian so Grand Lux. it was Nice surprise.....it was good / really good and we were in and out within an hour at 11pm. Probably because it is Vegas, we will not go back, but we would go to other Grand Lux locations. Meaning that in Vegas too many great options nothing about the food or experience.",

Darn, once again I forgot to take photos of the wonderful food we enjoyed last night. Almost any meal I've ever had here can be shared by two.  A nice warm crusty loaf of bread is brought to the table to start. For my entree I tried something new last night, Indochine Shrimp & Chicken ($19) & it was 5 star. The flavor was out of this world: onions, ginger, cranberries, sun-dried cherries in a plum wine cream curry sauce served with rice. I ate a lot but I didn't even get through half of it. My friend had Parmesan Chicken (under $20) & he agreed with what I told him I had thought in the past: best he's ever had. He also had more than half left-over.   While eating we saw a monster strawberry shortcake dessert get carried past us & my friend had to try that-delicious. I had the waiter bring me an eclair from the bakery attached to the restaurant. Again, leftovers.  Though I gave GLC 5 stars, if 4 1/2 were an option I'd have demoted it. Or if I have the same problem with the waitstaff again I'll give it 4 stars: The wait for the entree & then the dessert was very long. Our water glasses were never refreshed. I wasn't asked if I wanted white or brown rice with my dish. There's another reason I might demote GLC in the future: it's quite noisy & tables are crowded pretty closely together. Upon my insistence we were lucky enough to be seated at one of the only booths in the place.  I still highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe to locals & visitors wanting a reasonably priced  great meal & varied menu.",

We got the chicken and waffles and the chorizo omelet. So dang good. The waffles were super soft and fluffy. Most spots you go to throw over some dense thick waffles. Not here. You get some fluffy waffles (think pancakes!) with some pecan flavored syrup. You heard right!  The chorizo omelet was spot on as well. Not too cheesy and not to greasy. The sauce was a nice touch.  Only downside, the tables are super close to each other. Unless you like someone listening to your conversation and ogling over your food while you eat and they wait for theirs, I'd like to see the tables spaced out a bit. The line gets super long here too. Unless you wanna wait, get in at off hours or early in the morning around 8am.  All in all, great breakfast spot. $19.50 if you want an all you can eat breakfast buffet. A la carte also available",

    "text": "Located right next to the guest hotel elevators at Venetian and open 24/7, this place is the perfect spot for any time of the day. Came here on a Saturday night for dinner with a group of 14 people and they seated us very quickly. Service was very attentive from the start, they had waters and menus in our hands within a few minutes. After ordering, they brought our warm fresh bread and butter which I decided to stuff myself with.   I ordered the Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms. Portion size was humongous, could have easily been two meals for me. Reminded me a lot of Cheesecake Factory, which I learned later that they are under the same ownership. I'm not a huge fan of pasta, but when done correctly, it's like I'm having a party in my mouth. The pasta to sauce ratio was perfect, chicken was cooked very nicely and the hot chili flakes added that much-needed kick to the dish. Definitely one of the best pastas I've had. Had I not stuffed myself in the beginning with bread, I probably would have been able to finish it, but I ended up taking half to-go.   For Vegas, this was very reasonably priced and once again, the service was on point especially with the number of large parties in attendance that night. They were nice enough to split off table by table for the bill which made it a lot easier to pay in the end. Been here multiple times for different meals and it is always consistent, will be back again!",

    "text": "Long story short: The Cafe Beef Wellington is worth every penny and many more!  Long story long:   12 years ago (yes, that's how my story starts), I went to Vegas with a friend. One night we ate at Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian and I ordered some chicken dish. The chicken was forgettable, but it came with the BEST mashed sweet potatoes I've ever had. It was so good that I immediately researched other Grand Lux locations, hoping to dine at one soon again. Sadly, there were very few of them at the time. I've been thinking about those potatoes ever since.  12 years later (i.e. now), that same friend had his bachelor's party in Las Vegas. We went out for some very fine meals, though I was most intrigued by our plan to return to Grand Lux. But alas, their mashed sweet potatoes are a thing of the past. A disaster! No way this place could live up to my memories of it now. Oh well; no point being sour at my friend's party. I found the Cafe Beef Wellington (filet mignon pieces) on the menu and after much debate decided to try it. I normally don't order any type of steak dish unless I'm in an actual steakhouse. A waste of money, I say, 99 out of 100 times. Not. This. Time. It was not only one of the best steak dishes I've ever had for under $30, it's one of the best I've ever had.. (Read that as \"I've ever had, period.) And all of the sides were exceptional as well. Except for the mashed potatoes. Those should have been sweeter.  (Also, our waiter Joseph B. was wonderful. Huge thanks to him for chasing me down outside the restaurant after I forgot my hat. You might say my hat's off to Joseph. But don't; people will groan.)",

And no matter what time you come here, the food just sucks. I've had breakfast and late night. For the price you are paying... I'd rather go elsewhere.   I ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken and it came without the chicken. The pasta was nasty. I tossed a whole capful of pepper and Tabasco to help the taste. All I taste was olive oil with bits of peas and bacon as decoration. No flavor...   I also ordered the \"Fresh\" garden omelette. It comes with Mushrooms, Tomato, Avocado, Green Onion, Zucchini, Fresh Spinach, Havarti Cheese and Sour Cream. Sounds good right? Well, my question is how does anyone that works in a restaurant industry not know how to cook a proper omelette? And if anyone gave you food at 4 AM when you are starving, it wouldn't be a tough decision to eat it right?   My omelette was served half cold. The egg was rubbery and dry. The menu made it sound so savory and yet I taste barely anything. I couldn't even finish.   I really regret coming here and it will be my last.",

The interior is really nice, for a \"cafe\" it is beautiful...of course it is inside the Venetian after all.  We even saw two wedding parties dining here.  3. The menu is massive.  Think almost Cheesecake status. They really have something for everyone.  4. The drinks were really tasty. I had the pear martini and the strawberry martini. Mmmmartini 5. The service was wonderful. My husband's meal was late (ended up being only a few minutes) but they brought him a soup on the house for the inconvenience. The manager came over to apologize too.  6. Now onto the food...from the warm bread to our appetizer (we had ceviche) and to my entree (steak, rice, mushrooms) it was all quality food. I had a bite of my cousin's mashed potatoes...so good! And my husband's chicken parm was great too.  The prices aren't cheap, but less expensive than most nice restaurants inside Venetian and Palazzo. Plus you have cheap options in the menu of you want to save a buck.  Highly recommend.",

I was impressed with the food quality. The atmosphere was nice - like a Cheesecake Factory. It is a great place to eat when you want something really delicious and don't feel like dressing up. We tried out several of the other cafe type places at Aria and Mandalay Bay and this was the nicest, most affordable and had the best food of the bunch.   We also came back another time for desert. I had the creme brulee which was two deserts in one- chocolate creme brulee and the traditional type. It was delish and would be a great desert for two. My sweetheart had Godiva cheesecake and proclaimed it as good as Cheesecake Factory... Minus the Godiva truffle they decorate theirs with.   The rars will be back.",

    "text": "The Grand Lux Cafe is the sister restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory and are located in heavy traffic tourist spots. From Miami (beautiful restaurant location) to good ol' Las Vegas you can have a pretty good shot of finding one. If you're ever traveling this is a sure bet of a place to go with a large crowd if you have a wide variety of eaters including the picky ones. On the menu you can find entrees from salmon, steak, salads, and the menu is about 8 pages I felt like. SO MANY OPTIONS. The food is consistently good and I have always been a fan of their brunch especially the Sunday \"All you can eat brunch\" at the location inside the Venetian. The food is moderately priced especially considering you are eating in one of the most expensive cities to eat at. So it shouldn't come as a shocker when you're paying a nice penny; however, still far below the price of some amazing restaurants around town. I was fortunate enough to pick off of everyone's plate (yes I'm that friend) and each one was hot, properly cooked, and made correctly. The wait time is fairly quick and impressive considering how many people come to eat at this location. One thing for this particular location that bugged me was the underwhelming factor of the decor. Compared to their other locations I've eaten at this one was not impressive to say the least. Overall this is a great location to visit if you're wanting to host a large crowd without having to wait forever and a day.",

The food wasn't good either.  I had the Sunday night pasta (short rib sugo basically) and it was not seasoned at all and had an icky taste.  Boyfriend had an Asian chicken dish that he ordered spicy, but it was sickly sweet.    All in all, will not be returning.

The friends I were with ordered some mimosas, and they did not come for a good 20 minutes, so they wanted to cancel it, but the server mentioned that were already made. My friends refused to pay for it, and the server simply rolled her eyes and took it back, and gave us attitude about it. She made my experience here really not very good, next time i'll make sure she is not my server!   Overall, good food, mediocre ambiance, and RUDE service!

We had lemonades which were good but way too sweet and concentrated so we added extra water to them - then they were delicious. I had the Madeira chicken which is chicken breasts covered in mozzarella cheese and a mushroom sauce poured on top. It was pretty good. My Wife had the Cuban Sandwich which was decent.

Since it is in Vegas, just expect to be seated with some very loud people and if you do not think they are, maybe you are the one that is loud. Hey it is Vegas right.

Bryan our server is proper, professional, knowledgeable, and very friendly.  What a server is truly supposed to be like.   We love !! Love!! Love this place :)",

I always get the chipotle avocado burger. its one of my favorite burgers in town. My dad always gets the turkey burger and he loves it. By brother had the Chicken Royale and was impressed. The size of the meals are really good too. if you aren't that hungry you could easily share your entree or take it home and have a nice lunch the next day. The Asian Nachos are not to be missed! They are out of this world! It comes with a wasabi cream which I don't care for but every server but one reminds us of this and ask if we would like it on the side.   The space is very large but you wouldn't know it looking at it from the casino floor. There is tons of seating and we've never had to wait more than a few minutes. The servers are great and always make sure we have what we need. The one thing that drives me crazy about this place is they don't serve lunch until 11:00 but are open 24 hours. I don't care for breakfast and we had to wait 15 minutes for our server to put in order.  All in all the positives out way the negative. Its a great restaurant with great food and service. If you give it a try you won't be disappointed.",

It wasn't terrible food - both days I ordered some pretty easy breakfast fare (eggs, bacon, etc) and my wife did too (pancakes, eggs). The service was super slow and the food was not cheap.   We didn't try the buffet.  I'd recommend room service. We had a much better breakfast via room service in the hotel and it was cheaper or just as expensive even including the service charges.  The only shining star of the Grand Luxe was their coffee. It was great, smooth and not bitter.",

We went to the Venetian location mainly cause we could not find the location to the palazzo one where we were staying.   The wait time to be seated was non, however to get service it too a little while, especially to get drinks. Our server was semi nice. However, here are why this establishment received two stars:  1.  The food took over an hour to get out, the restaurant was not busy nor did we order complex dishes. (6 people total in group)  2. Refills on water and drinks took a while   3. The food was just okay! Way bellow Cheesecake Factory standards for a place that's suppose to be more upscale.   Overall, don't go here if you are looking for quick service and great food. There are other places to go for similar prices both at the palazzo and Venetian. My top is to go to Bellagio or Paris where they have restaurants with great views, after all you can always go to a suburb near you and get Cheesecake Factory type food but you can't get world class entertainment and quality there.",

The Asian Nachos were a bit more on the sweeter side because of the peanut sauce, but it was still so delicious. The Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms was also good, but did not WOW me. I also got to try my friend's Pasta Carbonara (Imported Spaghettini Tossed with Smoked Bacon, Peas, a Touch of Garlic and a Parmesan Cream Sauce) and damn this one was so DELICIOUS. I would definitely order this one the next time I visit Grand Lux Cafe.",

I followed that up with chicken and waffles and it was legitimately good. Like, the kind of food you'd rave about if it were served at a hipster establishment you waited in line for.

First of all, I was very happy that they were able to accommodate our last minute reservation for a party of 16 on a Saturday, a couple of days beforehand. Last minute sibling shenanigans.  Secondly, you know how you have a reservation but you're still waiting once you arrive despite the reservation you made. None of that here. Our reservation was at 5:30pm and they were ready to seat us at 5:30pm. Since I hate not being on time, this already made my day lol.  The remainder of the evening went well. Everyone enjoyed their food. Sorry, too many people to name individual meals. My dad alone sampled 5 different sibling plates and he definitely gave a thumbs up to each one of them. I believe Linda was our server and she was really great and patient with such a large party.   In the end they brought both of my parents a pastry dessert celebrating their anniversary. Although this was not my first selection for our celebration, I was so happy that this is where we ended up dining. And most importantly, my parents enjoyed themselves.  Thank you Grand Lux for making our dining experience such a great memory!!!",

    "text": "One time when we stayed in Vegas for 5 days, we ate at the Grand Lux 4 times.  Yes, it's that good.  Not only is the food scrumptious, but the menu is as large as the average American.  It's causal, flexible, and you can have whatever you like, however you like it, whenever you like it.  Poached eggs and a burger at 2AM?  The Grand Lux can make it happen.  The food at the Venetian location tastes noticeably better.  We had the Manhattan salad here once and the shrimp came juicy and grilled (which wasn't the case at the Palazzo location). My recommendations include the sliders, the miso salmon, the grilled veggie pizza, Chipotle avocado burger, the spaghettini with clams, and the calamari.  The calamari merits its own sentence--we're talking squid, rock shrimp (think mini shrimp tempura), zucchinis, and onions.  For the price, it's basically the best calamari you'll ever get.  Now, the Palazzo location has better desserts (the dessert menu is almost entirely different).  I highly recommend the molten chocolate cake (see my pictures and you'll know what I mean).  The Palazzo location, at least during the afternoon, also had a smaller menu listing mini appetizers (around $5 or so).  We tried the haystack which was similar to the regular calamari appetizer, but stripped of the seafood--just onion strings and zucchini slices.  The result? A vegetarian delight and now one of my new favorite fried appetizers to get!  We went to the Venetian Grand Lux the next day hoping to order the same thing, but alas, no mini appetizers there.",

The calamari also included fried zucchini (I skipped on the onions). Both calamari and margharita pizza were pretty salty--downed my entire liter of bottled water during the meal. The margharita pizza was also pretty thick for a pizza I expected to be more thin crust. Both do not stand well for consumption the next morning. Whoopie pie was okay, though the cream in the middle was very heavy on the frosting.  Portions indeed are huge. I probably would've been fine eating just the calamari appetizer without getting the pizza. Order was ready 20 minutes, so not too long of a wait. Pretty convenient for those who want a quick meal to take back to their room (restaurant is right near the hotel room elevators!).",

We also ordered the molten chocolate pancake, very fluffy.   Their orange juice is freshly squeezed, very refreshing; coffee is good; you can also order pineapple juice, cranberry, mango, and apple juice.

Don't get me wrong, these dishes are fulfilling and decent sized. If you are still craving for Grand Lux after 2am, they do have a 24hr dine-in on the Venetian side. A lot of guest staying at the Palazzo complain about walking to the other side for Grand Lux because the restaurant side closes early. It really only takes less than 5 mins. to walk there.   Although the menu is limited at the 24hr bake shop, I personally like everything from the menu like the buffalo chix rolls, buffalo chicken wings, alfredo pasta, smoked salmon, cheesecake options and carrot cake.",

We thought the $25 per person for the buffet was a steal until we saw the small one room of buffet items which mainly consisted of bread and pastries.   Their savory items are far too few and they lack flavor. Their hashbrowns were dry as heck. Their scrambled eggs were good though. Too bad most of their items contained pork. The buffet wasn't creative in the least. I enjoyed some of the good items like the mini chicken and waffles and they have a build your own omelette bar where the chef has mastery of cooking eggs how you like them. Be sure to tip them!   Their desserts were really good though. Particularly the creme brulees and the fruit tart. Skip the honey vanilla latte, it wasn't included in the price and I couldn't drink more than 3 sips because it tasted purely sweet and not at all like coffee. Gross.   The order off the menu items looked better. Service was okay. The server was efficient but not friendly. You should just go to wicked spoon buffet for breakfast instead.",

I was able to order a burger since it was almost lunch time.  I had the following:  - Double Lux Cheeseburger - two certified angus beef prime burgers with melted American cheese, slow-cooked caramel uses onions, red wine sauce and garlic aioli on a toasted brioche bun - the burger was so delicious and hit the spot, much more satisfying than a breakfast omelette or something!  Would come back if in the area.",

If you're limited in options and want to stay within the casino, then the Grand Lux Cafe is a good enough option.  Sometimes, you just want a quick bite to eat that's better than fast food.",

We arrived about 11:15 am and I ordered the buffet. First off the majority of the hot selections were luke warm. I had to go through several plates before I found a clean one. There was no syrup in the syrup craft and several times I had to ask for serving utensils as there were none to be found. For folks who do not eat red meat there was no fish, chicken or tofu option and most of the dishes had red meat in the mix and it was not listed on the placards. The Best thing was the ready to order omelet and the custard. Our server was great ! We may have done better at one of the cheaper buffets.",

Their menu is pretty long and it usually takes me a while to get through the whole thing and decide. Everything sounds delicious! I love their complementary wheat roll...mmmm...always wrapped in that warm napkin. Mmmm...kay i'm getting hungry! Their sangria is served in a tall glass and oooh...they serve it pretty stiff!

I just recently stayed at The Venetian with 7 other girls for a bachelorette weekend and Grand Lux came in handy on SEVERAL occasions. We had several other meals planned out, but between staying at pool parties too late and needing disco naps before heading out for the nighttime, we didn't make most of our dinner plans...so this place was the answer! We would call in the order, go down in our robes (quite the site, lol), pick up the food, take the food back up, and feast in our rooms :) We had everything from pizzas, to potato spring rolls, to salads, and everything was great. The best part was the price...for 8 girls to eat, the total was only $96! That's less than lunch cost us the first day at one of the panini cafeterias across from the Grand Lux...if only we knew!   We also used the Grand Lux for breakfast one day as we surprised the bachelorette with a Lingerie party brunch in the room...we had the waffles, scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, and fruit salad (along with some bottles of bubbly and OJ we picked up from different places around the hotel...Afterall, what's a brunch without mimosas?!) and we all loved every breakfast item we had.   Some of the girls also used this spot as a late night (OK fine, early morning) spot to snack before hitting the sack, but I didn't...I was more concerned with keeping my liquid diet going ;)",

We couldn't decide on what to eat for the longest time but the server ended up deciding for us on a pasta w/ sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, chicken with some sort of alfredo sauce.

They had a omelet station and fruit station. Not a good selection.   Now this review is for breakfast, the server only came once to refile our coffee, before we ordered anything, we placed an order for \"benue\" sp.. the server told us that it will take 10-12 minutes to get it. No problem since we had not even eaten yet. The server was MIA, since we could not get any services and i Finlay saw him and inquired about our desert an hour later, he told us he was not sure what happened since the food runners bring out the food and he though we already got the food. don't you think we would have liked some coffee or something to drink with the deserts?

Now that they no longer offer their White Cosmo, this one is my favorite.  Two of my dining companions had Bloody Marys that were made just right -- spicy but not too.  One had a frozen Margarita that was well made and not overly sweet.  We stuck with appetizers on this trip, and the best of all were the crab cakes.  No doubt the best I've had with lumps of crab in a well seasoned mixture lightly grilled.    We ordered the appetizer combo and enjoyed the following:  Vietnames Spring Rolls with chicken and fresh cut veggies in a steamed, cold wrap served with peanut sauce or spicy sweet and sour sauce.  Philli Cheese Steak spring rolls with diced steak and cheese in an eggroll wrappper fried and served with chipotle mayonaise.  Also eggroll style was the buffalo chicken served with the absolute best bleu cheese dressing I've ever had.  My husband's favorite were the steamed duck dumplings.  The Spinach Artichoke dip was creamy with plenty of artichoke.   For dessert I had to revert to my all time favorite creme brulee duo - one vanilla and one chocolate.  Best ever!  It was 11:30 on a weekday.  Seating was immediate and service was outstanding.",

It's always got a HUGE selection of food to choose from and the portions are equally large.  The best bang for your buck for spur of the moment hunger attacks.  One thing I don't understand is that no matter how many times I order the Strawberry Cheesecake, it just doesn't taste as good as the ones from their sister company (Cheescake Factory).  3 stars because you were  too drunk to give a proper review Maritel?  Gimme a break.",

    "text": "Great for accommodating large groups (came here on a sat. night with a reservation for 16). Restaurant is basically an upscale Cheesecake Factory (same creators) minus the million flavors of cheesecake. Food is just as good, almost the same actually. I got the Madeira chicken which I always get at The Cheesecake Factory and no complaints. I shared a calamari appetizer and was pleased to find some fried zucchini and even shrimps as well. The batter could have been more crunchy though.  Service was great, although the pace of our meal was a bit slow but I can understand that since our group was so large. Also, it was a bit dark in the restaurant to where I had a hard time reading the menu. And ladies in heels, be careful as the floor is quite slippery. Nonetheless, I'll be returning.",

This place is a sister restaurant to Cheesecake Factory, so you'll see a lot of familiar menu items and decor. The menu or at least the late night menu is much more limited than Cheesecake Factory, which to me is a GOOD thing! I can never decide what to get at Cheesecake!  This last time that I went the server was AMAZING! And it was like 3AM, I think his name was Sean. He was running around like crazy serving, but was super attentive and friendly filled my water and diet coke countless times. I was very impressed.  The food was good as always. I have had several items off this menu in the past, but this time I tried the Kobe Burger. I tend to stray away from the Kobe Burgers because usually places just put the Kobe name on it and make a mediocre burger leaving me disappointed! That wasn't the case here... The burger was moist and really flavorful with caramelized onions, sauteed shitakke mushrooms and togarashi aoili!   I really think you can't go wrong here, grab something that sounds good and I am sure you will be more than satisfied ESPECIALLY if you are here in the middle of the night!  MY GO-TO DISH: Quality food at any time of day or night? They're all GO-TO DISHES ;)",

I was hungry for some steak on top of it all. I let my friends try my dish. The 4 of them each got a forkful of the pasta, bacon, peas and sauce combo (i didn't share my steak)... they all raved about it and couldn't believe PEAS could be so delicious. Grand Lux pulls it off.  My friends had:  chicken and waffles... 4 stars (good but too sweet for her)  burger... 5 stars delicious  crispy caramel chicken 5 stars!!!  chicken parmesan... 5 stars  I had an overall really great experience with the food here and i can't wait to go again!

At the recommendation of a friend, we had the Buffalo Egg Rolls...which are awesome. Buffalo chicken fried in to an egg roll and served with bleu cheese dressing? Yes, please.  After that, I had a kind of tropical salad, which was good, but not great. The chicken was kind of tasteless, needed a little seasoning, and the dressing was way too sweet. It was served with a nice mix of lettuce, jicama, bell peppers, sweet peas, and other veggies, but it didn't need to be drowned in all that sweet dressing. The fried flour tortilla chips served on the side were drenched in the stuff, which made them like eating sopapillas.  Price was...not appalling for being inside a casino, and service was friendly. I would probably go back for the buffalo egg rolls, but there are definitely more exciting spots to be had.",

    "text": "Wouldn't have been interested in coming here except that it's in the Venetian right where the Phantom is playing, and a line was forming right after the show let out...   The Grand Lux Cafe is in the same family of restaurants as the Cheesecake Factory so you can expect the same kind of menu with the same large portion sizes. Even though there is one in town back in LA and this one has been here in the hotel for years and years, this is my first visit to a Grand Lux; heck, even my daughter has been to this place with her friends before we've been here, so on this occasion since the four of us were all together as a family, she acted as our unofficial guide...   The Lux has a very casual cafe style and feel to it. Even though it was located in a posh hotel environment, you could tell that people came to this place in waves: basically before and after each showing nearby, and anytime there is a group or convention in the hotel. What I really didn't like about this particular restaurant was that the marble tile floors were so slippery. I remembered that I almost skid and ate shit once I got up from my seat, the floor had a thin veneer of grease or butter where I had stepped. I tried to warn our waitress who was standing close by to be careful about the slippery floor, but all she could muster up was that the floors were always slick and that she wore shoes with special soles. Great, what about us poor unsuspecting souls?....   Everybody here (on Yelp) seems to like the Chicken and Waffles so that's what I ordered. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=cfloeeSOVB7A2MUCpDsTdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKN...</a> Nice thick 8\" round Belgian waffle with deep nooks to hold the toppings and maple syrup and dusted with confectioners sugar, finally topped unceremoniously with fried chicken strips. Nothing wrong with the chicken strips as they were skinless chick boobs fried crisp in their stretched and mangled shapes, they were not greasy but a little dry because of the white meat. I still don't really get the whole chicken and waffles Southern style because I usually eat either one separately. All I can say is that I could only finish 3/4 of this incredibly heavy plate of carbs...   As a matter of fact, I was so disinterested in my meal at this glorified diner, that I didn't take much notice in what the rest of the family ordered. A Chicken Madeira plate,<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=fjfX7LmaHR1KwWj2UGc09A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKN...</a> a Short Rib Cheddar Cheese Burger,<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=pa-WSyb4F6YJTe3J4O4__A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKN...</a> and a Manhattan Salad w/turkey, avocado, and beets...  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ?select=LjB39F-tysXCzG2owrYu5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/NvKN...</a>  The good thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours, but for the price and convenience, I think I prefer the Peppermill down the strip a little more...",

When I took a friend for lunch we had to stand and watch 4 people at a podium pushing papers and talking for almost 2 minutes before I finally cleared my throat and asked \"are you able to seat us?\".  We were dropped off at a table and every server walked by and never even hinted that they would be back to help us.  Finally one of them walked up and quickly asked \" are you ready to order? \" .  We were not even given water earlier.  After our meal, the server walked by and placed the check on the table.  So I guess a refill of our drink and possibly desert was out of the question.  I am very disappointed and embarrassed that I have continually recommended this place to visitors and had no idea how much the service level had declined until experiencing it first hand.",

This was very disappointing part was this is usually my FAVORITE restaurant in Las Vegas. My pork chop was over cooked and 3 others had to send their dishes back to be corrected because it was cold. I ordered the chocolate cookies for dessert because I LOVE the fact that they bake them to order but they were actually cold as well.  We asked for a manager on 2 occasions and he brought out a supposedly fresh and hot potato that was hot on one end and cold on another? I asked him was my cookies supposed to be hot, he replied yes. So, I said please tell me if these are and he said no. His resolution was to remove the item off of the bill instead of correcting the poor food quality.  One last thing, the lighting was sooooooooo poor that the menus were unreadable. The group at the table left to me were using their cell phone flashlights to read their menus...sad to say this may have been my last time patronizing this business.  I once again want to thank our waitress for the effort she put in to salvage a pretty bad experience.",

While Ellis Island was a bit out of the way for us this time around, Grand Lux doesn't disappoint when it comes to a spot for steak and eggs. Oddly, it was served as a large plate of 3 eggs (your style) and hashbrowns, and a nice side of NY strip steak and choice of toast. All in all not bad for $20.   Their brunch buffet is also a great option for $25 and includes coffee and different juices (grapefruit, orange, apple, etc.) as well as several items available off their breakfast menu. All in all a good deal as well.  Anyways, I'm a fan. 'Til next time, cheers!",

    "text": "As part of the Cheesecake Factory family, that focuses more on food than cheesecake, Grand Lux is a solid restaurant located in a Vegas casino.   I have been to this location many times over the years, weather as me and another person or in a group. Each time the service was friendly, the food was great and the prices are good for a restaurant on The Strip. I especially like the breakfasts here, the variety of French toasts here are pretty delicious.   If you are looking for a nice sit down on the strip and do not want to pay an arm and a leg, Grand Lux is a fantastic choice. The food portions are generous and the menu has something for everyone. The food is Cheesecake Factory like, so if you like that chain, you will definitely enjoy Grand Lux!",

We didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes. Service was fast and friendly in a Las Vegas sort of way.   Including coffee, I think the meal was around $16 before gratuity.

I was not going to eat a sub-par meal, especially before taking a flight. When I let the server know, she didn't even flinch so maybe it's not the first time crap food gets to a table?!

I am very glad they pointed us there as the restaurant was fantastiic. Food, service and even pricing was not bad at all! It definitely reminded me of The Cheesecake Factory with how it looked inside. I think our waitress told us the chain was owned by the same people who run Cheesecake Factory. In any case, I think the food here is a step up from Cheesecake. I ordered the eggs benedict and my boyfriend ordered the 2 egg breakfast with hasbrowns and bacon. My eggs benedict was delicious...both poached eggs perfectly cooked and just the right amount of hollandaise. Their hasbrowns are amazing too...very crispy outside which I love. If you are looking for a nice brunch on the strip I highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe!",

We always get seats at the bar area since there is no wait time. They have impeccable service.   They also have THE BEST French Toast in the world. I'm a French Toast specialist and these guys are definitely the best. Please note that the portion size for the French Toast is huge so I will recommend to share.   I've tried other items from their menu as well..  I have absolutely no complaints. Their pancakes are also pretty awesome.  Dining in Vegas can get really expensive but I'm happy to report that prices at the Grand Lux seems really fair. You essentially get your money's worth for sure.  If you're visiting Vegas at any point please visit Grand Lux located in The Venetian Hotel.",

Did that until 4 AM, wandered and met up with friends at around 6 AM, and decided we needed some grub. Did I mention we didn't eat since about 6 PM the day before?   We were basically starving zombies in need of nourishment. Someone recommended this place and what a great idea! I'm not sure was it the hunger, the alcohol at the club, or the zombification feeling I had, but my order was awesome. I got some sort of omelet. I want to say a california omelet, but I'm not sure. I know there was sour cream, avocado, and tomatoes. Whatever omelet I got, it was soooooo tasty. This was one of the best omelets I have ever eaten. My group seemed to agree and they all loved their dishes (3 got omelets and 1 got a breakfast sandwich).   I would definitely come back for their omelet.",

Jambalaya with rice also fulfilling & delicious.   For flavor twist try Thai/Asian nachos. Tasty but not spicy yet has a small flavor kick.  Seems pricey but really the portion are LARGE.

The slaw was bland and the sprouts were a little too toothy for my taste.    The portions here are huge.  I could not finish my plate, that is saying something.    What made this experience amazing was our waiter, Jose S.   I have had good service in the past, but Jose S went over and above all expectations!  Not only did he gladly ask questions of the chef regarding dietary questions that I had, but he when the computer told him that they did not have the item I desired, he took the extra step and checked.  Who would have thunk it?  The computer was wrong (even though two other waiters came by and told my table that they were out of fried chicken.)    The waiter can make an ok meal great, or make a great meal terrible (see my review of Nundini's.)  This waiter made the meal amazing.    Even though he was working on Christmas day, he was happy to be there, glad to help and treated us like guests in his own home.",

    "text": "First of all, Grand Lux has their operation down to a science. Getting diners in and out with efficiency is something they've mastered. I was impressed when we dropped in for a late breakfast/lunch Saturday afternoon. Located smack in the middle of The Venetian, the line was out the door. Luckily, we only waited about 5 minutes before being led to a table.   Rumor has it that Grand Lux is affiliated in some respect to The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure if that's totally accurate.. Whether or not that's True makes no difference to me because I am a Cheesecake Factory fan!  At any rate, I opted to be good and order a Turkey Club Sandwich. Unfortunately, I also acquiesced to their offer of a bread basket. The bread was nice, reminiscent of Cheese Cake Factory bread. It was damn delicious. My Turkey Club was also nice. It had fresh tomato and thick cuts of bacon. Bread was chewy and perfection.   My lunch companion opted for the breakfast buffet for $18. They will cook you a custom-made omelet. Hash browns, sausages, bacon, pastries and scores of other goodies are also available. Likely a good deal, especially if you have a good appetite and want multiple servings. But I was trying to be good, and was happy with my Club Sandwich. Although, admittedly, my lunch companion brought me a side of hash browns from the buffet. So, in retrospect, I guess I wasn't really that good.  Overall, very pleased. Cost is very reasonable, especially considering it's a restaurant located in a Vegas hotel. I would certainly come here again.",

We ordered different omelettes each time. We made our own omelettes with the list of toppings (max of 4), as well ordered the chorizo and cheese omelette, fresh garden omelette, and the crab & asparagus omelette.  The chorizo and cheese was bursting with flavor but a little too oily/greasy for me - especially for breakfast. Between all the omelettes we've had, it definitely had the boldest flavor. Something I'm willing to skip first thing in the morning.   I liked both the build-your-own and the fresh garden omelettes - fresh, hearty, and nutritious! Definitely a nice kick-start to the morning!   Crab & Asparagus omelette - tasty, but a bit of a waste. The tomatoes, asparagus, and cheese were simple and awesomeee together. Unfortunately, they overshadowed any presence of crab. Sure, you could see the little crab meat pieces, but the expected seafood-y sweetness that comes from crab was buried under the other flavors in the omelette.  All the omelettes came with a generous side of toast + jam/butter!   Def recommend for a hearty and fresh breakfast!",

The waiter was the fastest of anyplace we ate on the entire trip and he split all of our checks without any attitude! They also came out with a special desert for me as the bachelorette! Loved it!",

My co-worker and I were walking (crawling) back to our rooms and I really wanted pizza, she some dessert.   Anything you want in Vegas! We walked in and gave it a shot. Pizza was devoured and the dessert thoroughly lapped off the plate. We eat pretty clean during our trips but this was magical. We even discovered that the place is HUGE inside when we returned to have some burgers for lunch later in the week. Very much like the Cheesecake factory but I like this one better.

The food and service was so good, we came back later for the late night food (this place is 24/7). They have options of seafood, pasta and sandwiches to Asian and chicken and waffles. All of the food is amazing and the drinks are good too! This place is great at all hours with something for everyone, including the kiddos, in an intimate, dim-lit setting.

As we were walking away from the entrance and headed to the back of the restaurant, the floor started to get REALLY SLIPPERY!  My wife had on heels so I was worried she may slip and fall and asked her to hang on to me just in case.  We made it to the table ok.  Once we got seated, the waitress was quick to return within 10min and asked if we were ready and I said give me 5min.  Well she kinda disappeared for another 15min before coming back. I'm was still fine with that.  We ordered and then also had a glass of wine.  It took almost 15 kin to get the glass when the bar was right behind me. I could have walked there and got it myself.   It took us 45min to get our food!!! WTF!!!  I was tired and hungry and thought it was a quick bite.  My sliders were just ok and my wife's fish was way over cooked.   Well, what made me really upset was when I heard a loud crash of plates and looked behind.  There was a waitress getting off the floor and broken plates all around.   How can a restaurant inside of the Venetian be so careless that their own staff can't even work without dangerous environment.   I hope she she's the shit out of them.",

So when my group of 13 was looking for a place to grab lunch on a Sunday, of course I recommended that we go here.  To my dismay, it was not at all what I remembered it to be. The food in general was of low quality and on the opposite side of the spectrum from a fresh, juicy meal.   The fried chicken tasted like it had been sitting in the warmer for a few hours, the macaroni and cheese was really bland and dry on top (my boyfriend recommended that I dig into the middle parts to not have to eat the stale pieces on top-- I shouldn't have to do that!!), and the Salisbury steak tasted like it had just come out of a frozen food box.  My favorite part of the meal was the iced tea. 5/5 on the iced tea.",

    "text": "Had a quick lunch here soon after checking in and dumping my bags in the room. It was too late for a full lunch and I didn't want to fill up as I knew my friends and I were going have a big dinner in Chinatown. This place seems pretty crowded no matter what time of the morning, day, or night it is and there's usually a bit of a line to get in. Luckily for us we only had to wait a few minutes since it was kind of getting toward the end of the lunch hours.  I must say this is a pretty nice place....nice trendy looking cafe....dimly lit....with lots of table or booth seating. Immediately after being seated, our server came over to greet us and took our drinks order....nice and friendly guy. It didn't take long to decide what I wanted and I knew the portions would be pretty large, so my friend and I decided to split a chicken salad sandwich with fries. Not bad.....had pretty much all the fixins' and the fries were hot and fresh....my only complaint would probably be that it could've had more chicken salad filling in it.  We came back here again two days later for their breakfast. Before I flew out to Vegas, my brother had given me a couple of Costco coupons for either a free continental breakfast or the grand lux breakfast buffet for just $11+ (Usual price about $19+). Of course we went ahead and chose the breakfast buffet! It wasn't a huge spread, but good enough for a very filling breakfast....lots of fresh fruit. yoghurt, pastries, breads, a couple of hot food stations with hash browns, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, and waffles.....and there's an egg station for eggs made to order.....nice touch :) Drinks are ordered from the server separately, and OH WoW......the OJ is freshly squeezed and amazingly refreshing! For what you get for the grand lux breakfast buffet, it's well worth the regular $19+.....and is just an absolute deal at $11+! Yum!.....Very good breakfast!  The menu is pretty extensive with pretty much all you need to satisfy any kind of 24/7.craving.",

They have this at Cheesecake as well, but it's a little different at GL because they have sugar on top of the shortbread.  I also tried their strawberry smoothie. It has coconut in it. It's just like Jamba Juice strawberry's wild with coconut.  Their creme brulee comes with regular and chocolate. The chocolate one is VERY rich in chocolate.  For 6.95, it's not bad for two large servings.   Just don't expect great service and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "I went here twice during my last trip.   Sometimes what is lacking in Vegas is a middle ground restaurant, especially in Venettian. You want a restaurant atmosphere, but don't want to pay $200 just to have a meal for two. Yet, you don't feel like paying $15 for a greasy Philly Cheesesteak at the food court. Grand Lux is your middle ground restaurant. Its owned by the creators of Cheesecake Factory and its basically the same to me. Different menu, but still diverse and extensive. Perfect when you need something casual and have a lot of mouths to feed.  My first experience was very pleasant. I had the most attentive, kind, and honest waiter I've had in years....and...he was new!  When I first ordered, he made sure my party knew that the portions are generous. Personally, I like it when they're honest that the portions can be too much and sharing is encouraged for people with smaller appetites, even though it could affect their total tip.  I ordered a pasta and requested for no olives. The kitchen made a mistake and added olives so they had to redo it. I never saw the plate with the olives because my waiter caught it before it was delivered to me. He apologized repeatedly for the tardiness, but I was fine since I wasn't in a hurry and he was just so nice...its hard to be upset. The manager also came over to apologize at one point. Finally, I got my pasta. I just wish they would clarify that it was chicken chorizo on the menu, it makes a difference since I was expecting large chunks/slices of chicken.  I ended up tipping the guy almost 25% in cash and wished him luck before he left. He was such a doll, I would take him home.  Second time I went? Disaster! Snobby waiter who was giving us horrific service. Ignored us most of the time, didn't like the fact that a couple members in my party wanted to share a meal. When he was passing the meals over, he wouldn't even lean over to hand me mine, he just held it up in the air and I had to reach for it. Didn't refill my drinks until I was getting ready to leave! What's the point then? Didn't even give our party a basket of bread unlike the tables surrounding us. Lazy!  However, I think he's just the bad apple of the group. As my previous waiter was great and the manager wasn't bad either.  I would still go here just because it is nice to have something in the middle for dining, plus the menu accommodates just about anyone that's with you. I just hope my service is as good as my first visit.",

    "text": "Basically a smaller version of Cheesecake Factory (well they ARE owned by them hahaha..), but for some reason a whole lot better!   I've been to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times, and I felt that it was relatively over-priced for the measley portions they offer. However, Grand Lux shares just about the same menu, but pricing and portions are worth the cost.  While my friends and I were staying at the Venetian, Grand Lux Cafe was basically our go-to spot for food, regardless of time or circumstance, since of course it's open 24 hours. Incredibly convenient, especially for a city like Vegas!  I tried a couple different things I don't often order at restaurants, the Braised Yankee Pot Roast and the Veal Saltimbocca.   Now, you can get pot roast just about ANYWHERE, but Grand Lux prepared it so well. Normally, at your run-of-the-mill restaurants, the Pot Roast description says \"slow-roasted until tender\" and ends up being all dry and chewy. Grand Lux's version was a different story; I could've sworn the meat was as tender as butter and as savory as can possibly be. The vegetables were fresh and buttery, though I wasn't too fond of the yams. (Not a yam guy, so sue me.)  The Veal Saltimbocca was pretty much like a Chicken Cordon Bleu, but with a nice twist. The veal was done just right and the prosciutto and Fontina cheese complimented it well. Throw in a well-balanced mixture of Parmesan breadcrumbs and herbs and you've got a classic mainstay dish on your hands. The angel-hair pasta with wine sauce grounded out the dish very well, though I personally thought it was a little too oily.  I believe Grand Lux is one of those restaurants you just have to stop by if you're ever in Vegas, especially since it's open 24 hours. So whether you need some food to sober up after partying a little too hard at Tao, or would like a nice breakfast to talk over plans of the day with friends, I highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe!  -- Quan",

Belgian waffles with whipped cream and a side of strawberries should do the trick.

    "text": "Honestly, The Grand Lux Cafe is one of my top five favorite restaurants and has held this prestigious honor since it opened up.  Here is my top 10 list as to why The Grand Lux Cafe deserves the honor:  10. The menu is huge. If you can't find something that you utterly enjoy on it, go back to McDonald's.  9. The wait staff is always accommodating. You can substitute things and it will still come out the exact way you asked, on the first try. ( I have a picky mother-in-law and there are ALWAYS substitutions when she orders her meals)  8. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar and want to eat there, they set you up right with all serving utensils and place mat. Plus, you get your drinks faster, score!  7.Seating. We never have a bad table, and comfy seats.  6. Plenty of tables. When a restaurant is as popular as this one, they need lots of tables and The Grand Lux Cafe has plenty. I have yet to wait over 10 minutes  for a seat, even on a holiday weekend.  5. Artichoke Dip. This is my favorite appetizer ever and the Factory does it well. Spinach, artichokes, cheese=Heaven.  4. Avocado Egg rolls. Really, I have no need to say more.  3. Cheesecakes! In every flavor imaginable. And they all rule! They even have sugar-free ones for those of us that can't have sugar. Yes!  2. Blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis! These little morsels rock and The Grand Lux Cafe hand-stuffs them. Mmm...  1. And Finally, Miso Salmon. I can't even find the words as to how great this dish is. The fish, the sauce, it is so freakin' good. I have been to the restaurant when they were all out of it (it has to marinade over night and they only make a certain amount) and I think I cried. Thank goodness there are so many other delicious dishes but the Miso Salmon, just might be my request for a last meal.",

It includes your normal breakfast stuff: bacon, potatoes, sausage, eggs, and an omelette/egg station where they make your eggs any way you like. They have assorted fruit which was all extremely juicy and fresh! they have wheat and sourdough bread you can toast, jellies, bagels, cream cheese, and assorted pastries. And unlimited orange juice which i loved because they freshly squeeze their juice and its 4.50 a glass so i definitely had about 3 of them! this has always been a favorite of mine and it still ceases to disappoint me.",

As everyone knows the restaurant is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory so I had somewhat of an idea of what might be on the menu.   For the drink I got the peach bellini - loved it!  I ordered the chicken and waffle, which I was somewhat hesistant about at first since I read on Yelp it's not actual chicken wings, but chicken tenders. Luckily my food was great! The waffle was just how I love it, thick, crispy and sweet - as a bonus the waffle was topped with pecans and powdered sugar. The chicken was crispy and delicious, although it could have had a tad more seasoning. My sister got the pulled pork sandwich which she liked; it tasted very similar to the pulled pork sandwich at Cheesecake. Overall the food was great and I will go back on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

We went for her birthday with the Oh so fabulous birthday gift certificate they give all employees and I bet they are regretting now cuz we went BANANAS!  We started with the biggest appetizer on the menu, The Grand Appetizer Platter,  which featured a little bit of everything.  This appetizer is enough for 6 people, no joke.... Spinach Artichoke Dip (tasty), Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls( ok), Duck Potstickers(tasty), Buffalo Chicken Rolls(not so tasty), Cheese Steak Spring Rolls (not so tasty) and Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls(the chicken was super dry and this is the 2nd time we've tried them).  We then shared the Mongolian Beef which was really good, served with pita bread and rice. Why 2 starches? Beats the heck out of me.  Then the staff was so nice to let us go see Jersey Boys and come back after the show to enjoy the Strawberry Shortcake. I love strawberries, i really do. But there was nothing special about the shortcake. Just typical, but still good.  My roomate will sometimes bring home other deserts which are WAY better. So way better they get to the point of craving status...Warm Banana Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding is my all time favorite and the Roasted Pineapple Upside Down Cake is also very very good and they are all big enough to share.   On one of my visits I got the chicken, thinking it was like Fried Chicken (like a leg and a thigh), but it wasn't. It was under seasoned chicken strips. The batter is missing something chef. Please handle that.  Overall i would go there again even if my roomie didn't work there.....",

It's a good place to come to after-hours when all you want to do is eat to avoid a hangover the next day!   A group of my friends and I went and didn't have to wait too long. The inside was nice and big. One waitress took care of our big party with ease and seemed very friendly. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo since I was craving pasta. My thing is, if a restaurant can serve you a simple entree and make it taste delicious, then that's all I need. Noodles weren't over-cooked, sauce had a rich, creamy consistency, and the chicken I added tasted tender. Ooh, I also tried some of the red velvet cake.. my cherry on top! No hangover the next day and was ready to strut down the strip for another nightly palooza!",

The portions are so ridonkulously huge, you could easily feed a herd of elephants with one dish.  I had the Zen Noodles and they were so much better than I expected.

What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.    The beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?  If you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...  I tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.  The greatest part is that they have 6 cheesecake factory cheesecakes (b/c it is the same company) and a whole bunch of other awesome desserts that I am sadly usually too full to eat.  I can't recommend this place more!",

So although that didn't happen to me, it looks like it is something to be aware of in case you are pressed for time.   My friend got the veggie burger, and she said it was without a doubt the best veggie burger she has ever had! The portions are HUGE, so my other friend and I split a pasta dish, and it was INCREDIBLE! It had bacon and chicken in it with peas and a creamy garlic sauce. Honestly, I wish I could eat more because it was amazing.   Our drinks were good too! Between the three of us we had the house red Merlot, Lemon Drop Martini, and Asian Pear Martini. All of it: perfect.   Service was great too!",

Their menu is not only huge, their staff is very friendly and helpful through the whole process, given that the it's quite sifficult to decide from such a big variety. They are owned by Cheesecake Factory and apparently they used to have one in Hollywood but closed it down. It is definitelh a shame that I found out too late. Buffets are so overrated, this place is definitely worth every penny. I guarantee that every item on the menu will leave you with NO regrets!",

First time having this burger and it was out of this world!  Huge patty of beff topped with mushroom after mushroom!  And not to mention the truffle aioli!  So good!!!  Probably one of the best \"Mushroom Burgers\" I've ever had!  3)  Calamari/rock shrimp appetizer!  This is one of the reasons why I return to Grand Lux Cafe!  Such a big portion for less than $15!  Comes with super generous portion of calamari, shrimp, zucchini, and onions!  It's just so delicious!  Just a couple of \"could be improved\" points....  1)  Iced tea:  They have the normal kind... unlike Cheesecake factory, they don't have the tropical iced tea.... they really should have this....  2)  Service is inconsistent...  We had a nice waitress then she has to leave for her shift... then the person who took over for her was no where to be found... although she was nice as well but it takes forever to get service and attention of the 2nd waitress.... they will need to improve on this....  If you are looking for a solid food place in Vegas anytime of the day not name Denny's... Grand Lux Cafe is a terrific choice to be at!  (Available in both Venetian and Palazzo!)",

    "text": "I like Grand Lux Cafe.  It's a solid restaurant.  Their menu options are vast so I really think the experience can vary based on what you order.    First of all, the restaurant is located right on the casino floor of the Venetian.  We sat right in the front balcony area which can be exciting but not recommended if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke.  After a while, all the smoke made our eyes water so I would advise a table in the interior of the restaurant if you're smoke-adverse.  I ordered the Sunday Night Pasta on a Sunday night.  The portion was generous, always a plus.  The meat sauce had beef short rib, steak, mushrooms, and other seasonings.  My test for pasta is, I can usually polish off an entire entree if it is really, really good.  With this pasta I found the meat sauce to be on the heavy side.  The spaghettini was all right but on a whole, the entree did not wow me as it did in some of the other reviews.  I ate about half my plate.  My wife got the Zen noodle soup.  I tasted it.  Not recommended.  Probably should have known better than to order an Asian noodle dish here.  To be clear, there's like a hundred other things on the menu we didn't try.  I intend to come back and try something new.",

They have finer dining cuisine, more filling cuisine, typical casual sit down dinning cuisine, and stuff for the kids all in one place.  They greet you with slices of French Baguette which was okay, and butter which was pretty good.  The service is pretty nice.  The waiters are friendly and attentive.  We ordered the Mahi Mahi and Salmon Trio.  They were both in the mid 20s price range, but the Mahi Mahi did not disappoint.  It was moist with a crusty top of Parmesan and bread crumbs, and flavorful veggies and capers accompanying it.  It was served over a bed of fluffy, creamy mashed potatoes.    The salmon was disappointing.  The fish itself was dry, overcooked, and not flavorful.  The accompanying veggies and sauces weren't great, either.  They came with a similar tasting batch of mashed potatoes.  If every dish was as good as the Mahi Mahi, this place would have earned 5 stars.  It is my new favorite classier dining spot in Vegas.",

I recommend the mango slinger (vodka) and typhoon (rum). Drinks were only $5.50 each and worth every penny.  The food on the happy hour menu is a great value also. My favorites is the potato spring rolls. Same size as regular menu offering. HH menu is a great way to sample your way through their gigantic menu.  Brunch - very basic. Nothing special that you must try so I'd recommend skipping it and walking over to Yardbird for a more unique brunch experience.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are regulars at this restaurant . We have went to dine in and celebrate many birthdays or other special occasions. We have filmed on location while dining at this restaurant and posted videos on our YouTube Channel. On January 26th 2017 we went in to dine after getting off from work. We could have chose any restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip but for some reason we always patronize Grand Luxe because of the ambiance and the many food choices they offer on the menu. We went with an expectation to spend a lot of money. We always order an appetizer and get two full course meals and get dessert plus two alcoholic drinks. I ordered a pina colada to drink and my boyfriend ordered a Mai Tai both our favorite drinks - for my meal I ordered fried chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered jambalaya with sun dried tomatoes on the side. The problem is my meal came out first, My boyfriends meal cans out extremely slow and when he finally got it not to his liking. I even could tell it was rushed and not properly made . It looked dry like it say a while and did not have hardly enough sauce. Also for dinner portion it looked more like a lunch portion. We asked our waiter to give us another menu so that my boyfriend could order something different and sent back his jambalaya. My boyfriend decided to get the same thing I ordered the fried chicken and waffles. We also requested to get the potato rolls as an appetizer since he was so hungry and his meal was poorly made and took forever. Our waiter said he would put both in for us . We also ask to speak with a manager. We both had never seen this manager before being regulars at this restaurant he looked new . It was a black gentleman I forgot his name but he introduced himself and asked my boyfriend what was the issue which was a dumb question because our waiter had clearly told him what happened prior to him coming over. My boyfriend explains fully how he was dissatisfied with his meal and the way it tasted and how poor it was prepared. He asked the manager if we could get an appetizer on the restaurant since after all it was there fault and to our surprise he refused. Like are you serious? The traffic that this restaurant gets from the tourists can clearly take care of our small request. We are locals that live in Vegas and frequently eat here. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I refused to eat a bite more of my meal while my boyfriend didn't have anything to eat. We both told the manager we were leaving and would not be paying for something he couldn't provide . Which was good service and making the customer feel good by correcting the problem . We were not trying to get a free meal we wanted service. As we were leaving the manager gets on his headset and says we are walking out and not paying ....another white gentleman that looks like he's his manager gets in our face and tells us if we ever come back we will be thrown out and they will get security on us . Wow never welcomed to this restaurant with pleasure no customer should be treated like they are not worthy to eat in an establishment. Prior to this happening we have spent our hard working money and have paid bills that were $200 each time we have come in . Like I mentioned before on drinks meals dessert etc .... never judge a book by its cover we were coming in to spend money and we always recommend our friends and family to eat when they come to vegas . Grand lux will go down in flames and will be erased from our memories after this. Corporate or someone who is over this location needs to contact me ASAP to make this better or to get feedback so this won't happen to anyone else. We ended up having to go to TGIF Friday's near our home because other restaurants on the strip were closing on a week night . Unfortunately I have to admit we were taken care of and greeted by the manager at TGIF Friday's much better than how we were treated at Grand Lux which is a more upscale restaurant. If corporate ever reads this contact me at <a href=\"mailto:stolintino@gmail.com\">stolintino@gmail.com</a> any time . I plan to share my experience on my YouTube Channel and tell everyone of my experience. Your managers need training or need to be replaced they just don't get it !!! We have ate at your location at the Palazzo as well but prefer the convenience of 24/7 dining at the Venetian. I can't believe still that an appetizer request paid by the restaurant caused all of this which is just stupid or at least offer to take the meal off the bill - We have never had issues with your waiters or waitresses it's clearly upper management that wants to treat the customers like shit . Please screen who you are hiring for management positions. My boyfriend and I are foodies and we do reviews at restaurants all the time . We travel a lot and this was clearly a let down .",

I have eaten this dish at TCCF for years all over the country and this was such an absolute bust that I will never return to Grand Lux Cafe! Come on you cannot represent this brand like this.

    "text": "Came for Valentine's Day lunch, got seated in under a minute. It had a very romantic feel. We ordered the grand calamari ($15) absolutely delicious!!!!! It had fried shrimp, fried onions, fried zucchini, and fried calamari. They also served bread and butter with it. I ordered the pasta telephono it was amazing. My boyfriend had steak and mashed potatoes which was delightful. I also ordered a side of fries which weren't all that- very oily, and came almost after I was done with my entree. Waitress attentive but must have been busy because she didn't check on us that much and took a while for food and the check. Luckily we weren't In a hurry. But the total for everything was about $73 which I think was worth it. The portion sizes we're HUGE we could barely for our two entrees on the table. Had a lot of leftovers to take with us.",

We walked in and were greeted right away and quickly seated. After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before. On the bright side the food was good.",

And this dish is huge enuf for two and less than $20. That is why Cheesecake Factory Co rawks!   You will not miss it when staying at the Venetian cause it is located right next to the room elevators and you will not mind going more than once because there are a lot of dishes to try and their desserts are great too.  And service is impeccable. No snotty waiters nor waitresses.   Fill you up and go easy on your pocket and will not let you down kinda restaurant ... yea!",

    "text": "Woah so good! Or maybe that was the alcohol talking?  I went here with my buddies after clubbing at Lavo. I was so hungry but did not want anything too heavy, so I opted for waffles haha! First of all, I'm so grateful to our server. He was so patient with us while we were all being drunk and breaking things (we're so sorry!) He was friendly throughout, so we all gave him 18% tip. Back to the food, WOAH those were some awesome waffles! I originally wanted chicken & waffles but they ran out of fried chicken (sad face) but I was definitely satisfied with their waffles & strawberries. Their serving was pretty big and the waffle itself tasted soooo yummy and fluffy. I'm usually very picky when it comes to waffles because ever since the first time I tasted authentic Belgian waffles as a kid I've yet to find anything close to it... I don't think Grand Lux's was close BUT it definitely was delicious. Have I mentioned the size of their menu!?? I guess it's because Grand Lux Cafe is related to The Cheesecake Factory. I've tasted one of my friends' slider and I was impressed at the consistency of their food. At other places, some of their dishes are hit or miss but after tasting my friends food, all tasting very good, there's a good chance that whatever you order here will be delicious.  So whenever I'm at the Venetian or Palazzo and hungry enough to eat at the casino I'll most likely to dine here =)",

Their portions are ginormous!  Two dishes is definitely more than enough for two people.  The boyfriend and I shared: ~ Fried Calamari: appetizer with rock shrimp, zucchini and onions.  One of the best fried calamari dishes I've ever had.  Batter was super light (almost tempura-like).  Also liked that they threw in some shrimp and veggies for some variety.  Yum-O!! ~ Cajun Chicken Jambalaya: ordered the lunch special (which is supposed to be smaller than their regular portions but still huge!).  Tasted more like a Chinese stir-fry to me than a Cajun dish but it was still alright. ~ Half BBQ Chicken Pizza & House Salad: another lunch special with ginormous portions ~ Creme Brulee Duo: two huge creme brulees (vanilla and chocolate)...still liked good ol' vanilla better.  We had so much food leftover...we ended up eating it for dinner.  Our server was really friendly and helpful.  Definitely would come back next time we go to Vegas.",

We knew we were gong to pay a premium for anything around here, which was fine, but I was pleasantly surprised when we saw this place in Yelp.  Food is fine. Prices are fine. Only gave it three stars as the service was really slow - not from our server, but from the kitchen. But the place was busy and bustling.  $ 36.00 for breakfast - not bad considering you are on the strip.  I yelped the price at $$ because for the Vegas strip, it's lower than usual, which is okay by me. Anywhere else it might have been $$$.  I would definitely go back.",

They sat us at a rounds table that barely fit 5 people even though half the restaurant was empty and they had plenty of open tables. When we asked them for a bigger table, they had us wait in the front for 15 minutes without giving us any update or telling us how long it would take for them to seat us. When they finally found us a table, it was a booth that was smaller than the first table they offered us but we were so hungry that we decided to just squeeze into the small booth. Our server came and seemed like he was irritated that he had to serve us. He said he recommend the buffet instead of ordering off the menu, so we took his recommendation. Out of all the breakfast buffets I've tried in Vegas, this was the the smallest with the least amount of variety. Our server rarely came around to check on us and refills were scarce. For $25 dollars a person I was very disappointed with the overall experience from the service to the food. I don't plan on coming back here again. With the amount of options Vegas has to offer for food, I recommend saving your money and going to eat elsewhere.",

Her sleeves lingered over our drinks and plates; not to mention the fact that as we politely asked for tobacco sauce, she was grabbing it WHILE calling out over her shoulder \"what else was that?\" She described our portion of pasta to be huge, but in reality our probably could feed one person.

This restaurant is very skimpy on their alcohol, but big on prices. I questioned the bar tender and got no where, not good customer service. You would think they would try and accommodate their customer, but that didn't happen so I sent the drink back. Too bad because the food is good. I walked away very dissatisfied and will not be coming back. Too many other restaurants in this town, this restaurant doesn't need my business.",

My go-to has been the French toast - extra thick slices of brioche that are perfectly crispy on the outside and oh so gooey/custardy on the inside. It's very rich and is best with the added strawberries.   They're also adding new items to the menu - today I was able to try the breakfast quesadilla and it was amazing. The chorizo was the perfect balance of salt and spice, and paired greatly with the cheese and medley of veggies/salsa/beans.   My other great find today was the dozen of freshly baked chocolate chip pecan cookies for $8.50. We ordered it when we got to the table and it arrived fresh from the oven as we got our bill. The cookies are amazing - can't wait to go back!",

My favorite items here are... Pasta Carbonara with Chicken - Wow. I thought I've had good carbonara in the past, but that was until I've had theirs. Not only are their portions HUUUUUGE, but the pasta was so delicious! It was extremely cheesy, saucy and full of chicken. It was the most perfect carbonara I've had. Southern Fried Chicken - my #1 favorite item here!!!! I order this most times that I go. It's half a chicken, breaded in this amazing batter and deep fried to perfection. It's served with mashed potatoes and peanut cole slaw. It is so good. KFC got nothin' on this. Seriously, it's amazing. It's enough for two people, too. Cream of Chicken & Mushroom Soup - This soup is the bomb. Just trust me on this. Deep Dark Fudge Cake - One of my favorite chocolate cakes I've had, ever. It is rich and extremely chocolatey. A must try if you come here!  PRICE. Not too shabby, compared to other Vegas restaurant prices. The servings are huge so you get your money's worth for sure.  SERVICE. This is where they lost a star. The service I received on my most recent visit was sub par. Our waiter was M.I.A. most of the time, failed to refill our drinks and bread basket, and took forever bringing us what we asked for. The restaurant was busy when we got there, but the crowd died down after a while. I understand these waiters are juggling a bunch of tables at once, so no complaints were made. It just would've been nice to have quicker service. Not to mention, it took thirty minutes for our food to come out! Yikes! I usually order over the phone and just pick it up to eat in my hotel room. I highly recommend that. The service is quick and you get to eat in bed (score!).  OVERALL. I love Grand Lux Cafe and will always come back. I wish they didn't close the one in LA so I don't have to wait until I'm in Vegas to eat here!",

The next night, I dined here for dinner and tried their pasta. I can't remember what it's called but it was the beef short rib and ground beef pasta. The portion is also huge even to share!

The staff are helpful and friendly, but also seem to have a good sense of humour and really enjoy working there (or at least... they're good at faking it!).  We went for breakfast here both mornings that we stayed at the Venetian.  The first morning, I tried the Huevos Rancheros.  It was way too big for one person, but it was delicious. I ate way too much of it.  The second morning, I tried the biscuits and gravy.  They were different than what you'd expect.  There are potatoes as the first layer, then your eggs are placed on top of them, then the sausage gravy is poured on and it's topped with 3 or four mini biscuits.  A great take on an old classic.  Again, it was too big for me, but it was great.  I would happily order either dish again.  If there was any downside it would be that we weren't told about the buffet option.  We saw people bringing their plates back to their tables, but didn't realize it was an option.",

The menu did not specify that home fries came with the omelette so I was pleasantly surprised to see them on my plate. The chef did not skimp on the bacon in my omelette, I had a mouthful of bacon in every bite. The bf got churro French toast and a side of bacon. The churro French toast was so soft and sweet. If you have a sweet tooth, this is the dish for you. The portions of both our entrees were HUGE. We struggled when trying to finish our meals.

It's nice that the Las Vegas locations are still open for business when the Los Angeles ones have all closed down.   A restaurant concept from the originators of the Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Cafe also has a diverse menu that focuses on what I call new American diner. It is a good place for larger groups because the menu options are wide enough to give most members in your party something to choose.   The food is rich and some salads have more calories than their regular entrees.  Iced tea is one choice: regular, which differs from Cheescake's passion fruit iced tea option. Calamari tastes better than Cheesecake's version but order the large because the mini is really mini. For dessert get a cheesecake of course.",

My nephew has a severe serious peanut allergy and my niece has a milk allergy, so it's very awesome when we can all go to a restaurant and eat and it accommodates all of us. They are so good with kids allergies and very careful to not cross contaminate foods. We can come here and have peace of mind that the kids will enjoy a delicious meal and be happy and healthy when we leave. The food is so good, and they have so much variety. Our waitress was so amazing and so so sweet. I forgot her name I feel so bad but she was there in the evening tonight on Tuesday the 14th of May. Thank you for always being one of the best places to eat in Vegas! Xx",

We were recently in Vegas with six friends and couldn't decide where to have dinner. A friend suggested the Grand Lux Cafe....   The restaurant is located inside the Palazzo at the Venetian Hotel.  It's very casual-- has the feel of an upscale diner with booth seating and Fluorescent lighting. The menu is several pages long and includes everything from Thai Spring rolls, pizza, burgers and fries, all day breakfast, Chinese noodles, etc. Normally these places scare me because they try to do everything but end up doing nothing well.  This place was an exception.  We all enjoyed what we ordered, the service was attentive and the food was solid. Order the vegetarian chop salad with peas, lentils, beets, asparagus and cheese. Very fresh and filling. Note the portions are huge so you might want to share with a friend!",

The atmosphere is not too crazy but you know you're in Vegas. The place is always pretty crowded but you will get seated fairly fast. But anyways, to the food. I love the Mango Smoothie, by far their best smoothie worth the6 Dollars. My favorite appetizer from this place is The Fried Calamari and Shrimp. Fried to perfection and the tartar and tomato sauce are the perfect combo. Their burgers are pretty good. Specially The Max Burger. This has one of the biggest patties on a burger I've ever eaten. But my favorite main dish for sure is The Shaking Beef. Tenderloin Beef with red and green onions and spicy marinade and steam rice . I get the plate almost every time. But there's something for everyone. My favorite Vegas restaurant by a mile. You feel like a million bucks when you are here. The food is beyond expectations.",

The first night was Halloween and my guy friend dressed as a sheep falls asleep on a chair and takes a head dive into the ground, after a good laugh I was ready to eat and that was great pre-meal entertainment and I knew our meal would be delicious. The boys always order their chicken and waffles and they said it was the best as always and hit the spot. I'm a salad whore so of course I get a salad which was also delish! The service was a little slow but they warned us ahead of time saying that this was the busiest night they had in the last 2 months. But it was 5 am and it wasn't really busy, maybe they are just finally catching up after the rush...I don't know. But that explains why they were out of my fav dish there, the ahi tuna salad...nummmy. Oh well, there's always a next time for sure.",

Secondly, the most amazing part was the fresh bread.  It was SOOO good, one of the best breads that I have ever eaten.  In fact, I almost wanted to cancel my order just so I could stuff my face with it.  It was warm, chewy, crusty on the outside, with the butter melted... ahh!  I wish I had some now.  But on to the main food...I got a chicken sandwich, but the portion was humongous, and it was really good.  The fries were delicious too.  Everyone looked happy with their food, and the waiter was really nice.  I would definitely go back just for the bread.  Reasonable prices too, esp since you can share and still have some left to spare!",

Place was a little hard to find because the signs at the Venetion/Palazzo weren't too helpful. Even though the casino was packed there was no line when we went in so we were seated almost immediately. The waiter forgot to bring us bread so we didn't get any until after our main courses arrived. I ordered the Sunday night pasta, which is basically spaghetti but with steak and short ribs in it instead of ground beef. Don't get me wrong it was pretty good, but not really something I would pay $15 dollars for. You can't really tell the meat is better since the pasta sauce has a stronger taste. My dad's dish, on the other hand, was excellent. He ordered the slow roasted short ribs and they were fantastic, full of flavor, juicy, and tender. This place really deserves 3.5 stars but I guess I'll bump it to 4 since the decor is pretty nice.",

EVER!!! it's right next to tao and its open really late which is perfect if you're hungry after sweating off all the alcohol you've consumed during the night. i've been here twice and never had to wait...but then again it was like at 2 or 3. BUT, there were still a ton of people there. i got the chicken and waffles...which was heavenly. i shared it with my friend and still had some to take home, so the portions are definitely huge. I also had some of my friend's chicken flautas...MAAAAAAAAAN with the green sauce. SOOOO GOOD!! we took that home too. to me, grand lux cafe is like a less classier cheesecake factory. its a lot cheaper, but the food is still just as good in terms of quality and taste. and our server was so nice. I can't imagine having to serve a bunch of drunk annoying asses all night. if you're gonna eat unhealthy after a long night of drinks, might as well come here and pay a few extra dollars and have the most orgasmic drunk food ever, rather than go to mcdonalds or some other fast food place, just saying!",

This review is for the Grand Lux on the Venetian side, since the Palazzo was closed in July from a leak in the ceiling.   My mother & I decided to dine here at the Grand Lux twice. The first visit we sat in the bar area & was greeted by an awesome server named Aubry. She is very friendly & helped my mother order, since she was undecided & is hearing impaired. We ordered the empanadas & crispy Thai chicken spring rolls with fun drinks named passion fruit penicillin & sangria. Our overall experience with service, drinks & food was phenomenal.   The next morning we had breakfast & ran into Aubry on our way to being seated. Once we sat down, Aubry greeted us & let us know that her husband Joseph will be our server & helping us out with our breakfast. Aubry & Joseph are fantastic servers! They really made us feel comfortable in the dining location, helped us with any questions regarding the menu, & always checked in on our dining status. I highly recommend that if you dine here at the Grand Lux, Aubry & Joseph will provide a great dining experience for you.",

Must haves ~ Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls ~ Buffalo Chicken Bites ~ Shrimp Scampi ~ French toast & omelette  ~ molten chocolate cake  Basically everything from the apps to breakfast to brunch even the drinks are great. Portion sizes are generous compared to most restaurants on the strip.  This might be your best bet if you don't want to leave the strip for affordable prices.  Cheers!",

I've never been able to finish an entree here. Service is friendly and personable.   Extra Info -I stopped by for dinner this time and ordered the Sunday Night Dinner which consisted of simmered chunks of beef short rib, ground beef, onions, and garlic served that over spaghettini. After an eventful couple of days in Vegas for a bachelor party with minimal sleep, I was feeling exhausted and surprisingly cold. So this pasta was exactly what I needed! It was both filing and comforting. Basically, the damn thing gave me life. I just wish it was also spicier.   -Tea selection is decent. They present you with a fancy box of teas and you can make a selection. Tea comes with a lemon wedge and honey.",

We had two options, order off menu or do buffet. We were able to walk and check out buffet. We came back and decided the buffet was the best choice to go with since some of the platters from the menu cost almost as much as the buffet. If you're here, I'd say do the buffet. More food for your dollar. But if you're just filthy rich then you can do either. Our food was delicious. I really liked my fresh omelette the cook made right there. All the other stuffs were good too. I apologize for no pics and just a bowl of fruit with a tiny strawberry danish, lol. I was just way too hungry and forgot about pictures until towards the end. Oh well! Btw, their OJs are delicious!",

This morning we ordered biscuits and gravy, huevos rancheros, and the chicken and waffles.  The biscuits and gravy was really good. The gravy is made with thick chunks of sausage and the biscuits were fluffy and delicious.   The huevos rancheros was very good. It was a large portion and the ranchero sauce was delicious.   The chicken and waffles (my personal favorite) is very good. Not the best in the world, but pretty close to it. It is very good especially for Las Vegas.  This is the best restaurant in this hotel as well as in the neighboring Venetian. It has a great selection (akin to Cheesecake Factory). The menu is big and there are many options. The service can be a little slow, but the servers are very friendly and attentive.",

The weekend brunch menu is $$ priced but the ambiance and service are worth your money. Dropped by on a Friday morning around 9:30 with a party of 11 and we were seated immediately. We were split into two booths, but this wasn't an issue. They do have a breakfast buffet option featuring your typical breakfast favorites. I ordered the Florentine Omelet (~$15) with no mushrooms. This omelet features sauteed spinach, bacon, tomatos, grilled onions, and melted cheese. It is also served with a side of hashbrowns and toast. The grilled onions really flavor the omelet and the bacon adds the crunch factor. I wouldn't say it's a super special omelet, but it definitely satisfied my craving for a decent omelet.  The bathrooms are pretty dark.",

You can't really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory and sometimes it's just nice to know what you're going to get before you get it. I read over the menu and settled on a small salad and the appetizer Calamari. I asked that the salad come out first and they hold up the Calamari for a few. Of course the Calamari came first and the salad a few minutes later. I ate them both at the same time. Other than that the service and food was fine.  It's kind of a bargain for the Las Vegas Strip and specifically this end of the strip where things are pretty high end.  I would return next time I'm in Vegas!",

On arrival, we were seated at a high-top table close to the bar for watching a crucial sports game (that we *gulp* betted on). Our table of 4 ordered the buffalo chicken bites and fried eggplant to get us started. Verdict? Delicious without too much olive oil. For entrees, I went with a big caesar salad - containing enough lettuce to feed the army from \"300\" and split a chicken parmiggiano sandwich with my girlfriend. The portion sizes were HUGE but somehow, that aspect did not take away from the high quality food in front of us.  Grand Lux felt like a Cheesecake Factory only with better quality, service and feel. Situated a stone throw away from the both the Palazzo and Venetian hotels, it was a huge relief finding a place with solid food that did not try to \"nickle and dime\" us. Highly recommend this place, especially if you're considering brunch.",

The prices are more reasonable than other places during late hours. The sizes are incredibly generous and most importantly the food was surprisingly delicious!!   My late night partner in crime had their Bacon Cheese Burger ($14.50) medium rare and a Coke ($4.50). This juicy savory burger comes with crisp applewood smoked bacon, melted American cheese and grilled onions. He asked for the Thousand Island on the side and they kindly obliged. Presentation was great! They put the lettuce, tomato and pickles on the side to prevent the burger from getting soggy if you don't plan on eating it right away. The burger also comes with a mixed salad or french fries. We opt for the side of fries. I had a bite of his burger and it was super juicy and flavorful. The applewood smoked bacon was a thick slice so you can really taste it with every bite.   For my late night bite, I enjoyed the Asian Nachos ($12.95) and a large Orange Juice ($6.50). This glorious creation had crispy fried wonton chips as a base, covered with chicken, sweet-hot peanut sauce, topped with melted cheese, green onions and wasabi cream... with rice in the center. The rice really threw me off because there is not usually any rice in a traditional nachos, but it was really good. I love fried wontons so using this to make nachos was perfect for me. The generous amount of chicken and cheese was both delicious and fun to eat. I was able to save half for breakfast the next morning.   The Grand Lux Cafe operates throughout the day and night hours. I had such an enjoyable meal here, I would definitely consider coming back for breakfast, lunch and dinner... and of course the late night menu.",

We ordered Calamari for appetizer, Sunday Night Pasta, Cafe Beef Wellington, Pasta Milanese, and Garlic Shrimp Pasta. Portions were so big, one order of pasta can be shared by 2 people. All the food was well done and tasty!  The restaurant appeared to be large with plenty of seating, very nice ambience. It was a busy night when we came but we were seated right away.  We all had a wonderful dinner experience here and would love to come back. Great service too!",

I think I waited 15 mins before being seated. You can grab a to go cup of coffee from them before you get in line if you cant wait for that first cup. Service is fast and friendly and the food usually matches. This am we wanted one of our favorite dishes to have. The home made Corned Beef Hash. However this am we were informed it was being prepared with pastrami not corned beef. We always  add two fried eggs in top. As you can see from the picture the eggs were poached not fried and very small. We swapped out the hash browns for fruit. Good thing as the fruit was the best part of the breakfast.",

Service was good but nothing to write home about, also, nothing at all to complain about.  The food was good. Again, nothing to write home about bit it was breakfast so it's a little hard to mess up. The steak was a little too well done but its hard to get it medium on a thin 6oz. I thought I was ordering sliced potatoes (like you've seen me make many times before) but it was sliced tomatoes but that was the healthier choice.  The eggs were good and more than I expected which was good bc I love eggs. The blood orange mimosas was on ppint though.  The only other time ive been to @officialgrandluxcafe was for restaurant week in #cherryhillnj, not so much bc I can't afford it but I cook so I don't like spending too much money on food. I will go back though. Maybe before I leave.  I'm writing this while in a seminar and this guy keeps saying \"umm\". Don't they teach you not to do that before they let you speak for a company? Its so distracting. I'm counting them now, 67, 68, 69...   @officialgrandluxcafe is in @sandsexpo which is in @venetianvegas  #robsfoodreview #robsrestaurantreview #restaurantreview #foodreview #Vegas #lasvegas  Wish I could do stars by half bc it deserves an extra half at least, if not a whole one.",

My only gripe is that they present it fancy by providing uncut romaine lettuce leaves - Beignets: My friend LOVES these beignets. I don't get the hype  Pros: - The take out counter is open 24/7, so you can always get food no matter the time.  - I usually call ahead to order the food so it's ready by the time I get downstairs - Really large menu with basically anything and everything you can think of - Large bar inside  Cons: - Can be crowded and busy during peak meal times  Would I come again?

Salmon & eggs: The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was very tender and didn't have an overwhelming taste of seafood. The eggs were also good (very fluffy). Chicken & waffles: For me, the better half of the dish was the waffle. The chicken was very lean and seasoned well. Corned beef & eggs: I have never seen corned beef prepared the way Grand Lux does it. Usually, the corned beef I order is a little mashed up and thin. Theirs is on the thicker side and in big chunks. I'm definitely not saying it's a bad thing, because their corned beef is at the top of my list. Not greasy either. Red velvet pancakes: YUM. Just thinking about their red velvet pancakes makes me wanna go back. THE best red velvet pancakes you will ever find. Out of all the red velvet foods I've had, Grand Lux has convinced me that pancakes are the best way to have them. There's no way I'll ever be in Vegas without stopping by for their pancakes.  Service was decent. The food came pretty fast, but our waitress had a very \"fake\" attitude. She said everything a little too perky and she talked to our entire table like we were kids. But whatever. She was the last thing on my mind. I was too distracted by the food haha.",

Yes, it's similar to the Cheesecake Factory with their menu diverse and offers almost everything. But not to worry, despite their vast menu, the quality of food has NEVER suffered! The portions are huge but I never take it with me simply because my hotel room lacks a fridge and microwave for reheating purposed. The salads are always on point, fresh & crisp and not doused in heavy dressings. The pastas are always rich and creamy, and the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious. They also have great lunch combos for a great price and the breakfast meals are dynamite. Again, the portions are huge, even if it's only lunch for for the great menu pricing and quality, its worth it!",

If you have been to Cheesecake Factory, you will understand this is a similar menu.  The servers have always been very attentive from initial order, to drink refills and checkout.    I've tried a variety of the meals here.  The Crispy Caramel Chicken is outstanding with a bit of sweetness to go with a little kick.  The steamed rice accompanies nicely.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich, the Club, Chicken and Waffles, and several salads are a big hit as well.  One tip: Order a dozen cookies when you first sit down and they are delivered to your table warm when you get ready to leave.  Excellent!  Grand Lux is a great option for groups or if you want a nice variety to choose from.  Definitely recommend!",

This one is located in the Venetian and is spacious and the people who work the graveyard shift are peppy and upbeat.

The menu was excessively long, A section with breakfast, lunch , dinner, late night. all day.. with most of the same items posted over and over.. Suggestion.. maybe have one menu for each time of the day? I found myself finding something good, then looking at the time frame its served.. and then going back to the actual page I should be looking at and then getting disappointing its not there :( . eh.. small details.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich with sausage instead of bacon. Breakfast is good, all day.... hasbrowns yummo.. crispy n tasty, I asked for an over easy egg instead of scrambled and the ooey gooey yolk dripping everywhere just made this sandwich everything I could ever want and more.. lol  Corned beef hash - eh.. sorry, but I prefer the canned version over this one.. The corned beef was actually a bit dry and the overpowering bell peppers made this inedible for me  Bacon Carbonara - Although I am not a fan of Bacon, This pasta dish had excellent flavors . This is a must try for all you bacon lovers out there.",

Despite our huge group, service was punctual but no effort was made to be friendly. Water glass was full and food arrived in a timely manner.  The best part about Grand Lux is that there is something on the menu for everyone. From pasta, to steak, to fried chicken and waffles; yes, your picky eater will find something.   Our table ordered several appetizers, and the crowd favorite was the asian tacos. A must-try if you're looking for just a tad bit of an adventure!  And although my company was footing the bill, I was still peeved that many of the drinks (beers on tap, mixed drinks) did not have a price associated with them on the menu.   I ordered a plain old (or so I thought!) caesar salad for dinner. It was under the \"small salad\" listing, but it was definitely large enough to share between two people and certainly big enough for an entree for one. I only ate half of mine.   Overall, this was a great choice for a large group because of the diversity of the menu. With all the other great places in Vegas it wouldn't be my personal first choice, but certainly it's a crowd pleaser!",

I guess the manager realized we waited long and as a kind deed, he gave us free orange juice.   After waiting what seemed like hours, we got our food. I got the combination of the salad/fetucini alfredo and I was extremely eager to eat. Once I took my first bite into my pasta, I was disgusted with the amount of salt in it. I never taste such a salty pasta dish in my life! I thought I was the only one, but my friends tried and agreed it was extremely salty. My other friends ordered pasta/salad combo and it was super salty as well! I do NOT recommend the nasty salty fetuccini alfredo. It was so salty I didn't eat it anymore. I do not recommend this place, nor would I ever go back. I am sure other dishes were better, but I just had a terrible experience due to the long wait, our server who forgot about us, and the salty meals. Definitely NOT worth it.",

This is a small cute little place in a casino in Vegas. 1: It's overpriced (duh, read the part about being in a casino in Vegas) 2: Its crowded (Vegas, casino do we really have to keep going over this ?) But it is tastefully decorated and the servers are good. The food is darned good considering I normally avoid these places like a case of Ebola. If you're in Vegas ( obviously) and in the venetian, we stayed at the palazzo so we wandered by here quite often. We got horribly lost ( OK it was me SHH don't tell my wife I said that I'll never hear the end of it.) So this was always around, if you can't get out of the casino to eat due to lack of time or inability to find the door then this is a good albeit expensive alternative. Personally Vegas has a ton of great places to eat try not to stay inside the strip casinos. Be adventurous strike out see what else there is to see & eat.",

However, after the breakfast I consumed here I just maybe have found a change of heart.  I had a baja omelette I think it was called. It had loads of sour cream, veggies, and really felt like I was chowing down on a fajita, but without the meat. My wife had chilaquiles which was certainly the best I have tasted and had a perfect blend of kick, but not overpowering.   We went early morning so it certainly helped with the wait time as we got seated instantly. When we finished with our meal there was a giant line, but I think there was a huge party that was the root cause of that. Our waiter was amazing and very cordial during the entire meal which created an uplifting mood.   I still get tripped out by saying (in the style of Arnold) \"I'll be back\"",

    "text": "We were craving pho after Tao but too lazy to head off the strip so we came here instead.  Surprisingly, they had their own version of pho called Zen Noodles.  It was like a \"fancy looking\" pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth $14.  The primary reason I'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible.  We got there around 3 AM, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately.  After we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food.  It was like that for all the tables next to us too.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour.  I get that it's busy but I can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table.  In total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 - 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting (for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card...).  If you're looking for a place to grub after clubbing, I'd recommend going someplace else like Earl of Sandwich instead.  You can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price.",

The only other Grand Lux Cafe I've been to is the one in the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills and in comparison, they're pretty similar in terms of ambience and food, but this one is open 24 hours!!  We had a huge group of about 15 and we were lucky enough to get seated right away even though it was peak dinner time and we didn't have reservations (you have to make them 2 hours in advance).   My friend and I shared a sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza. It was super doughy (a little too soft for my taste). I couldn't even break the pieces apart cleanly without all the toppings and cheese falling off all over the place. But the CRUST was delicious! My friend and I found ourselves just eating the crust off of each slice towards the end. They have all kinds of food here--it's really similar to Cheesecake Factory because it's the sister restaurant. But I'd avoid the \"asian\" food if I were you, especially if you're looking for something authentic because you're probably not going to find that here.",

I think this is better than cheesecake factory. Despite the same ambiance, interior decoration, to-go bag color schemes, and menus, the food was a bit more tasteful than cheesecake factory.     I ordered the pork chops and I was very satisfied with my choice. When there is a mixture of apples with pork chops and mash potatoes and brussel sprouts- I'm in! The pork chops was perfect- not over cooked, not under cooked near the bone. I enjoyed every morsel that was left to the bone. My friends had a bite of my dish and agreed that they liked my dish.     The service was tentative. They were concerned with our experience which is surprising for our group of 13. Other places tend to neglect you knowing that they have a guaranteed 18-20% tip. Here, they asked if the whole party was happy with their choices.   Perfect meal and now to go hit the slots and clubs!",

First, GLC in the Venetian is 24/7/365 in Vegas... cant get better than that. I think I have gone there EVERYTIME i've gone to Tao on a fri or sat night (which is kinda scary if you think about it). It was a meeting spot after all the night's festivities and I have very fond memories of the place. Second, on one such drunken occasion, I was falling asleep at the table and knocked over a pitcher of water that fell on the floor and broke, and the waiter was kind and patient with my drunk ass. and lastly, though, the prices are a bit steep for upper-end-diner food, I'm willing to pay for it after the 100s of $$$$ that i lost or won in vegas... In L.A., it just sux to pay for expensive food.  (see L.A. grand lux review)  moral of the story.... everything is better in Vegas",

The outside of the establishment is misleading, it look like a cafe setting, but once you enter the main dining room, you feel the Cheesecake Factory-esqe decor.   Service: The bus service was attentive and pleasant. The waitress we had was rather sluggish, and mundane. A little personality goes a long way. I brushed it off because there were multiple tables she was serving and some of them had annoying little children.   Food: The food was decent. Just what i'd expect from a place like this. Huge portioned, comfort food. I ordered the \"Max\" burger. It is essentially a bacon cheese burger topped with short ribs. It was pretty good, and the cook prepared it just as i asked. Next time i think i'll try something else. I prefer the BBQ bacon Cheeseburger at Cheesecake over this one.   While overall a good experience with decent quality food at a reasonable price, i don't see myself going out of my way to come here. I'll probably stop by after a drunken night at TAO, but then again nothing hits the spot like a \"Jacks with a Kicker\" from Terribles.",

If you try to place it by phone, you will be on hold for 15-20 minutes before it hangs up on you. When you go down to place the order, the people working there seem to have a kindergarten education. SO slow!! The food takes forever to get done, and you wait, and wait and wait.  The people working there could be just a bit slower and they would work backwards. Seriously. Once they finally get your food out, its the WRONG order, NOT what you ordered at all.  For example: order 3 poached eggs and side of bread, simple right? One may think so. BUT after paying $15!!!!!!!!!!! for that crap i get after 30 minutes of waiting: Poached eggs, hashbrowns, no bread. Then they tell me they have no bread. I ask.. weird because I go here at least 3 times a week and order the same freaking thing EVERY time! They bring me toast. At this point, Im just so pissed off, and leave. Never to return again.  thanks grand lux!",

I had the Lux Breakfast Sandwich twice and a burger once. I have to give the food 5 stars.  The service on the other hand was poor, 2 out of 3 times. The first night we had a female server who was prompt, courteous and kept reappearing to fill up my water glass. The other 2 times, the male servers would disappear for long stretches. I had to repeatedly ask for more water and once they refilled my glass but not my wife's.

The people that work there very friendly and helpful, but I believe they might have to many tables to wait on per waiter/waitress, so if you need something, you may have to be a little patient.  Out of the four times we visited the grand Lux during the 1st week of May, 2014, the one meal that stood out above all the others, although the rest of them were all very good, was the French toast. Yup, the French toast. :-) It's about 2 inches high and tastes like you're eating a custard dessert. The secret is they soak the bread overnight in the sauce, and then fry it to perfection the next morning. The menu is very versatile and there is something for every taste. Hence the reason we keep going back there. Quality is always very, very good. And the serving sizes are also quite substantial.  I made a comment to our waitress when she suggested splitting my husbands hash-browns because there were none available at the buffet, that the serving size my husband got with his breakfast wasn't big enough to split. She came out a few minutes later with a plate loaded with hash browns. How can you beat that service :-)",

The sushi appetizer was yummy and their fish and chips were OFF THE HOOK - perfectly breaded, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. NOT soggy. Delish!  Love how this place is 24hours too - perfect for loading up on the carbs after a night of drinking at V Bar and Tao! :)",

    "text": "Grand Lux Cafe is definitely reasonable for lunch considering that you're in upscale casino hotel like the Palazzo/Venetian. However now that other people have mentioned that it is owned by Cheesecake Factory, I'm personally a bit disappointed especially since it's in VEGAS and AT the Palazzo/Venetian.  In terms of the food, they give you healthy portions which is good if you're hungry. One of unusual menu items I first noticed was the Asian Nachos??? Anyways, I had the Max burger which was okay imo. This is a good spot for lunch but avoid this place for breakfast. It's overpriced for breakfast.",

Purely by accident of course. 9) Friendly and understanding staff 10) It is located in Venetian, which is my favourite hotel!  There you go.  Come hungry and you will not be disappointed!",

Good food for a late night drink.  They also improved the bar list.  Last year, when I asked my Hendricks to be served with cucumber, they gave me pickled cucumber -- thank goodness I asked them to serve it on the side.

Caucasian guy with red hair. Worst waiter I've ever had. He wasn't attentive. When we would ask for things...he didn't even let us finish our sentence but walked away already -_- I understand that he can hear us while walking, but at least make eye contact & let us finish our sentence!! Rude. And we felt he was kind of racist. What, just cause we're Asians you treat us differently? He was soo nice & attentive to the table behind us, they were Caucasian... Good food tho. The chicken on our pasta was very tender. They cooked it perfectly, but bad service by Paul. It was my first time there, I didn't want to come back.  But we gave it another try tonight... (03/24/13)  This time, we had Judith as our waitress. And let me tell ya, she's the best ever!! Most adorable & sweet lady we've ever had ^_^ she smiles a lot, very friendly, and most of all very attentive! We're soo glad we got her as our waitress. Ended our Vegas trip with a smile :) 5 stars for her, 4 stars for food. The clam pasta we got was a little salty. Probably cause of the clams. Other than that, my pasta pomodoro with chicken was delicious!! :D  Definitely coming back for Judith :)",

    "text": "If you love Cheesecake Factory, then you will love this joint.  Why?  Because they are owned by the same company and are essentially the same restaurant.  After hearing rave reviews of this place, I knew it was worth trying.  After eating there would I head back?  Since there are so many other restaurants to chose from in The Venetian, probably not.  Got there at 6:00pm on a Friday night and were sat immediately.  There were three of us.  They brought out bread and butter right away, but really lacked as it took more than 15 minutes to come back and ask for our drink orders.  The menu selection is MASSIVE with all types of food.  We ordered: *Edamame: Soybeans in Their Pods Stir Fried with Spicy Szechuan Sauce -I've never had Edamame this way before and it was probably my favorite thing of the night, besides the sourdough bread.  *Asian Chicken Salad: Sliced Chicken Breast, Crisp Wontons, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Napa Cabbage, Green Onion and Roasted Almonds. Tossed in Our Asian Dressing -Completely flavorless.  The end.  *Seafood Salad: Lump Crab, Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Corn, Green Beans, Egg, Celery and Green Onion Over a Bed of Crisp Romaine Tossed with Our \"Louis\" Dressing -I didn't try this one, but the person said it was really good.  Very generous with the seafood!  For Dessert: *Butterscotch Caramel Pudding: Rich, Creamy Butterscotch Pudding Topped with Whipped Cream, House-Made Caramel Nut Popcorn and a Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie -To me, the pudding was thick like custard.  It was delicious!  *Key Lime Pie: Baked Fresh with a Graham-Pecan Crust. Topped with Fresh Whipped Cream -Delicious!  *White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake -Same cheesecake that is served at The Cheesecake Factory.  I mean, can you really go wrong?  Nope!  I will say that it was really nice to sit and chat with friends without being rushed.  We got there at 6:00pm and left at 9:00pm.  Now the service was very slow, but at the same time, if we weren't chatting and eating slow, we probably would have gotten out of there at 7:00pm.  Everyone was nice and had no problem splitting the bill 3 ways.",

It was the only thing that could save the dryness of the chicken.   I ordered the egg white omelette with ham, spinach, onions, mushroom with English muffin. But they got my order completely wrong and gave me some omelette with cheese and wheat toast. But I forgave them because they were gracious about it and the adowobo manager apologized to me. It was $12.95, but the $16.95 buffet would have been more worth the price since that included custom omelettes as well. When my order came again, there was too much ham, but barely any spinach. Booo.   They had typical but delicious buffet items. I will come back!",

Making the trek to the Venetian, we walked in and from the outside, the restaurant looks decent...nice decor, ok setting (not too noisy from the casino area although very close by) and clean, we were seated by a friendly waiter.  Surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't crowded even though we arrived shortly after noon time.    Moving on, we got to our table and the waiter handed us with our menus.  My friend asked how much the drinks from the bar would cost and he responded as anywhere between ($7~11)...fair enough...it's Vegas...you're gonna be charged quite a bit....  Thirty minutes down the line, we finally got our food....and unfortunately, not that impressive...would've gotten the same deal elsewhere at a much lower price.  Toward the end, the waiter wasn't very friendly with service.    Overall, I know that there are so many other places in Vegas to eat...buffet/upscale restaurants available, and I choose not to come back to this place ever.  It's too pricey, and the quality of the food isn't as impressive as first thoughts.",

We waited under 10 minutes for a table for 2 people. (I was honestly expecting the usual wait time of about 20-30 minutes like at the location in New York). Once inside, we noticed that the space is of the restaurant is huge.. Nicely decorated atmosphere with plenty of dining tables around.  We each ordered the Salad and Pasta Lunch Special, which was very affordable and delicious at $10-$11. As always, the portions are huge and I was able to pack some leftovers even with a lunch portion.  Staff here was very accommodating, quick, and knowledgable of their specials and food entrees.

When we got to the normal table, they had shoehorned a large party at the next table, with people sitting at the head and foot of the table.  The person at the end basically had their back pressed against our table. We mentioned it was cramped and asked if there were any other tables.  She said no, even though there were plenty of 4 tops open, and no one waiting.  She snarked \"that's why I asked if you wanted the high table\", although she failed to mention the cramped conditions when she asked.  We then said we'd take the high top, and which point she pointed at it from across the room and said \"the one he's cleaning\", referring to the busboy.  And then walked off.  We left and went across the way to db brasserie.  They had a nice brunch menu and polite staff.",

Service is usually pretty good although it is a rather large restaurant so it gets a bit hectic. The coffee is amazing. Maybe because it's Italian and we're by the \"venetian\" =P",

    "text": "I've eaten at the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian for lunch on my past two trips to Vegas.  It's the perfect lunch spot!  Prices are reasonable and portions are really big!  It's owned by Cheesecake Factory so it gives you an idea of what to expect on the menu - tons of choices (minus the cheesecake).  Breakfast is offered until 11:00am but there is a separate breakfast menu if you want to order breakfast after 11:00am (limited menu).    I never realized how big the restaurant actually is and it seems very popular so it can get tough to get your server's attention.  It took forever and a day for us to get our bread and other requests.  The bread is REALLY fresh and yummy but it's served with hard butter (sigh) so I forgoed the butter.  For this past visit I tried the Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich (grilled chicken breast, bacon, avocado, cheese, lettuce and tomato) with fries on the side.  Both the sandwich and the fries were delicious!  Generous portion of fresh avocado.  I'd come back. =)",

You walk in to a familiar setting with the look and feel of the Cheesecake Factory.  The bugers my party ordered were cooked to our specifications and within a very timely manner.  Try the Grand Lux Burger Melt! If you like a good \"melt in your mouth\" beef burger, with thousand island dressing, melted cheddar cheese, sauteed onions sandwiched between slices of Parmesan cheese bread... you'll enjoy this.",

There is a Grand Lux at the Beverly Center in L.A. if you can't wait til the next time to Vegas, but I noticed the service and atmosphere isn't the same, food is still good though.     One of my favorite's is the Grilled Pork Chops (Porterhouse-Cut, Glazed and Served with Mashed Sweet Potato, Vegetables and Our Own Chutney)  It's so tender and the sauce is to die for.  Second favorite is the Crispy Caramel Chicken (Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken Breast in a Spicy Thai Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. Served with Rice)  My Beautiful Diva friend Deanna got me hooked on this!  Third favorite is the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken (A Fusion Dish of Chinese and Indian Flavors. Jumbo Shrimp, Chicken, Onions and Sweet Ginger all Sauteed in a Delicious Spicy Sauce of Curry, Plum Wine and a Little Cream Topped with Sun-Dried Cherries and Apricots. Served with White Rice)  An explosion of flavors in your mouth.  I also heard the Wiener Schnitzel (Austrian Style Thin Crispy Coated Veal Medallions. Served with Mashed Potatoes and Braised Red Cabbage) is really good but I haven't tried it!  Oh and now to the desserts... They have all the Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes but let me tell you two amazing ones you should get. If you are a Creme Brule fan you'll love their Crme Brulee Duo  (Delectably Smooth and Silky. One Classic Vanilla and the other  Deep Chocolate. Finished with a Crunchy Sugary Top) mmmmm mmmm good!!! I also recommend the New Orleans Beignets (Served Warm with Three Sauces) it is sooooo good, but get ready to share cause there's enough for 2 to 4.  So the next time your in Vegas be sure to hit up the Grand Lux Cafe!",

I appreciate the \"custom\" customer service experience, the efficiency, and the quality of my meal.  This place gets a ton of traffic, being in a casino, but they really went the extra mile for me.

The atmosphere befits the decadence of the Venetian itself, creating a romantic, yet casual feel.   The waiter was strangely friendly and paused awkwardly between questions to create an uncomfortable feel, but nice, nonetheless. Our food was delicious, with large portions and sides. The meal begins with a plentiful breadbasket. I had the white eggs with hash browns and toast, which was a lot of tan-colored carbs, but around $8.95, and a huge meal. The burger with a side salad looked good.   Overall, a little pricier, but nicer than fast food on strip.",

It's a branch of Cheesecake Factory, and I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory because of it's wide selection of difference foods on the menu. Grand Lux Cafe is about the same. It has a similar menu and prices.  At the Venetian, I believe it's opened 24-hours as well, and the wait was pretty short both times. Service is decent. The first time I had The Max Burger (Our Greatest Hamburger Creation! Certified Angus Beef Topped with Cheddar Cheese, Crisp Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Roasted Short Ribs. Served with Fries), which had angus beef and short rib with cheese. You can't really taste the short rib, so it doesn't add much to the dish, but the overall the burger was satisfying and hit the spot! The fries were however a totally different story. It wasn't good at all, it didn't feel fresh, the tasted as though they didn't use fresh oil, and the frying was off. The second day I had the lunch plate jambalaya. I was kind of craving it. Not a good idea when you're eating at 3 and going to eat at a buffet at 7. Well the lunch is a decent size. The chicken isn't so good for jambalaya, but that's a given, it doesn't give meaty flavors to the dish. It also lacked sausages! Anyways, the dish was okay, not great, the burger was still fresh in my mind. Actually come to think of it, I'd more so give this place a 3.6, maybe given I was in Vegas made the food taste better and overlook the blunders of the food.",

Otherwise, it's standard liquid egg fare.  Go here if you're too lazy to leave The Venetian, but there are better buffet options, well, anywhere else.    The buffet is 2-star at best.

This time I was prompted to write a review because Julian the waiter went WAY beyond.  It was my daughter's birthday and they don't give out free desserts or sing but he heard it was her birthday and he brought out a plate with whipped cream, a sugary wafer thing and chocolate syrup writing out \"happy birthday\"....not an amazing dessert but it was just the thought and the fact that he did it.  It meant a lot to her!  Thanks.  As far as the food.  I love the lunch special chicken piccata and the lunch size Southwestern Salad!  Both great.",

Don't go to the front desk for to-go orders!  This place reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, which is nice feeling kinda nice going to get food after a drunk night at 3 in the morning. They seated us pretty promptly the first night we were in Vegas around 3, got us drinks, and our orders were taken right after. Props on the service, especially the water guy, I never had a glass half empty, good for good mornings after.   Got the deluxe burger, Just a normal burger with lettuce onions tomatoes and chipotle mayo with fries. It did take a while to get all our orders out, bread could only last us so much, haha. But the burger was bomb, and the fries, and my friends really enjoyed their food. they do have so very decently large portions, pretty sharable, so head up if you're not starving. Prices are cheesecake factory prices, so don't expect to get like 3.99 steak and eggs. For my burger and fries it came out to about 12 dollars with tax and gratuity.   To go is really worth it since you get the same thing without paying gratuity. a little longer wait, but still the same quality food. Got the deluxe burger again, and they give you more fries to-go. I'm down!  Definitely hit this place up f you're near the Venetian and need a late night meal. Hella good!",

    "text": "In a word ... HORRENDOUS!!!!  That's how I would describe the service staff during my last and final visit at the Venetian's Grand Lux.   The food .... I will give it a \"slightly better than lousy\".  I have been a satisfied patron at both locations (the one at the Palazzo and the Venetian) several times before, however, this particular visit was just truly horrible.  Our waiter was absolutely dreadful ... he was about as useless as the guy at the Genius Bar at the Apple store when you're asking for help and you happen to NOT have an appointment.  Our food arrived way way late, in fact, the people on the table next to us were being served their dessert by the time we got our entree ... and they freaking arrived and ordered several minutes after us.  Our drinks were neither refilled nor removed once we were finished with them ... and none of our small appetizer plates were removed during the entire length of service.  I realize that this is no MIchelin star joint ... but come on we deserve better than that.   As for the food ... well, it's difficult not to dislike it given the service or lack thereof.  The calamari was pretty much just eating fried batter or as my friend would describe it \"deep fried tire parts\".  The miso salmon was under-seasoned and just plain inedible .. as well as the shrimp scampi that I had the misfortune of ordering.  Funny thing is, I've had these dishes in the past and I know they can be good ... but this occasion must've been Amateur Chef night in the back.  I will never go back to this place and I advise the rest to avoid this place the same way you would an unleashed dog that happens to be foaming at the mouth with it's owner nowhere in the vicinity.  If you really feel the need to ... check out the other location at the Palazzo (it's only a few steps away) ... at least the last time I checked it out, they didn't have servers who thought they still worked at the DMV!",

    "text": "I was hesitant to be the asshole with the one-star review but as I recall more and more of my visit here, I feel the Grand Lux Cafe truly deserves a big ZERO.  Let me preface that my nine friends and I came to this hole as a collectively quiet and borderline hungover group at around 5AM after a looong night. That is to say, we weren't even close to our usual rowdy level, but actually resembled a group of elderly men and women who were REALLY, REALLY SORE AND HUNGRY.  We stumbled to the front desk to ask for seating for nine. There was no one there. We waiting for another couple minutes, searching for someone to help us and found a couple of the wait staff helping other tables (there were probably a total of five occupied in the whole place) and a few people chatting near the back. Once someone noticed the huge scattered group, they ambled over to ask what they could do for us. As if it wasn't obvious already, we asked for a table for nine. The hostess told us to wait while they could find an open table and the wait would be around 10-15 minutes. Seriously? As we waited patiently yet astounded, we saw her and a few people walking around... I assumed they were setting up a table large enough for us but wondered why it could possibly take so long with no one else waiting and hardly anyone dining.   After what felt like an eternity in Vegas time, we were sat at a banquet-style table (how hard could that have been to put together if it took any time at all?) with menus dropped off at the edge of the table for us to pass down to each other. The waiter left. He came back to ask what we wanted to drink. We said, waters, please. The waiter left. When he came back, he sloppily poured us all waters and left some of us with half-empty glasses. After asking us if we were ready to order five times in just as many minutes, he didn't come back at all. We had to flag down a DIFFERENT waiter to take down our simple-as-it-gets breakfast orders. Once that was all situated, it was purely a waiting game.   10 minutes went by... 20... 30... by 40, everyone had forgotten why we were even there and I was straining to find ANYONE who worked in the place to ask where the F our food was. As if they decided it was long enough, by 50 or 60 minutes, our food showed up. Eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. You'd think with that kind of preparation time they could also get these beginner dishes right. Some dishes came with extra sides of meats that were never ordered but would later be charged e$$$tra; some came without the sides they were promised; and one or two dishes were forgotten altogether.  When the bill came just as late as the food, we realized we had been had. The cheap dishes were almost doubled the cost on the menu bc the waiter never informed us of how much a side of three slices of bacon would cost, and some extras were brought out even without our consent. But we were over it. So, so over it. We paid the bill and left just as quietly as we came. Though I really wish we would have just dined and dashed (which is something my friends and I do not have the heart to do but it seemed so appropriate at the time).  Never again.",

    "text": "Every time my friends and I go to Vegas, we visit Grand Lux at least once. There is another Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo but usually the Venetian is a lot closer for us to go to. They have a large variety of menu items that range from classic American food to different takes on various ethnic dishes. You also get bread and butter when you sit down. The reason why I like the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe more is that we get seated quickly. It doesn't matter what time we go or how big our group is. If you've noticed that Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory have similar menus, they're owned by the same company.  When you order food, be prepared to eat. Their portions are big and you have enough to take back to your hotel room (if you have a fridge that is empty). I've ordered their bomb Caesar salad and I usually try different dishes when I go here. I had the Shaking Beef with Rice and that was pretty good. I usually get the Caramel Chicken and I can never finish it.   When I recently went here with my family, my sister ordered the Beef Short Rib Sloppy Joe sandwich. It looked pretty good and it tasted pretty good. Usually all burgers come with fries.   Service is always top notch. The last time I went here we ended using a Visa Gift Card that the server botched when he put in the amount. He ended up resolving it but was super nice about it. He wasn't giving us attitude. Their servers are always attentive and ready to ensure that your order is correct.    Find parking in one of many parking garages in the Venetian parking lot.   Order one of their signature lemonades and you won't be disappointed. They also have sodas and a full bar. A couple of years ago, my friend ended up ordering a double shot of Tequila for his drink at dinner.   Bring a group, prepare yourself to eat and have fun in Vegas!",

At least the location in the Venetian -- the one in Palazzo is only open reg hours.  I love that their portions are huge. Prices aren't exactly cheap, but they are fair for what you get.  My main complaint is their RIDICULOUSLY SLOW service, esp during the late night hours. Omg it was so slow. We were just two girls, but it was nearly impossible to get our check paid and gtfo to go to sleep at 5 am on a Fri night/Sat morning. We were about to fall asleep at our table.   Both times we went to Grand Lux on this trip, we just grabbed a table in the bar area to avoid waiting, and both times service was super slow. But I really like the food, and the slow ass servers are at least very nice. The Asian bartender at the Palazzo location was awesome to everyone around the bar. He must have been especially friendly if that made an impression through my drunken haze.  I would knock my rating down to a 3 for mind-numbingly slow service late at night, but I'll be nice because it's Vegas and everyone has a great time regardless.

I've always like the Cheesecake Factory for really one dish (Shrimp Scampi yay!) and one dish alone, and my initial impression of the Grand Lux Cafe was that they were a bit similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't realize then, that they are owned by the same company...but I digress....  At the Grand Lux though, I found more dishes that I like (Ahi Tuna burger, Double Stuff Potato Spring Rolls, to name a few).  This particular location was located right at the base of the set of elevators to the Venetian hotel rooms.  And at the time, being a Venetian guest, it was just way too easy to keep coming back.  Was I mad about that?  Of course not, how can you be mad at good food within walking distance to your elevator bank?  I also appreciated their long hours.  I guess being a Vegas location and all, it was easy for them to open early (early enough for me) and stay open later.  But I guess do to the close proximity to the elevators and their long hours, they do get full fast.  Full enough to cause 2 long lines...which I never quite understood why there were 2 lines to begin with.  If you don't mind taking the food to go (which is the easiest thing to do when the line is too long) head over to the left area which kind of looks like a cafe.  You can order Grand Lux takeout from there.",

Kristopher had the red velvet pancakes and side of ham. We should have went with the breakfast buffet since Kris's pancakes were so sweet, he said they tasted like cake. I figured it would be like that since velvet anything tends to be super sweet, but now it's confirmed. What is up with $5 for a wine glass of orange juice? (No refills).

Service was amazing as well. Attentive and friendly. However, we got a too friendly waitress once and her accent was really heavy, my sisters and I nicknamed her Helga since she didn't tell us her name...  Their fresh bread basket is amazing, it's not just bread, it's freakin AMAZING bread. their salads are HUGE, the pasta salad combos are a great deal and the omlettes,...make sure you are hungry when you order that baby.   the atmosphere is welcoming and perfect for a quick eat after a night out or marathon gambling. Dont want to dine in? they also have a cafe outside for a quick to-go kinda thing.",

Came here with a group of people when we were in Vegas and food is good, no complaints!  I think everyone enjoyed what they ordered, even down to the alcoholic beverages.    I ordered their BLT sandwich and it was great and delish with just the right amount of everything...and oooohhh bacon...who doesn't love that?! Crunchy and crisp and complimented the sandwich just right.  Although get your bread not toasted otherwise the bread becomes too crunchy.  Eh!  Service was prompt and friendly.  Prices are comparable to Cheesecake Factory.    Although, if you are looking for the same selection of cheesecakes like Cheesecake Factory, you won't get the same here.  There are only a few selections of cheesecakes, so don't get disappointed if you are looking for a specifc flavor of choice.",

I told the hostess, who was very sweet, that I wanted to get some food to go and she handed me a menu and said to order from the bar. I went into the bar, was greeted by a bartender and told him I wanted to order some food to go. He snapped at me. way uncool. Said I have to go to the bakery to order food to go. um....ok. Had he not been such a jerk, I would have had a drink or two while waiting for my food. It seems pretty lame that the bar can take food orders  to eat in but not to go? They lost at minimum two drink orders and my future business.  I wont go back.",

We ate there for lunch one day and as an early dinner before our flight back to NY.   I ordered the regular portion Cobb salad for lunch. It was HUGE!!! One word of advice, they salt and pepper their salads in addition to pre-tossing your salad with dressing before severing it. Therefore, it was very salty. I would advise you to ask that they not top off the salad with salt and if you also prefer, dressing on the side. I found this out wehn the manager came by to apologize after I asked if they could make me another salad with less dressing. The dressing was fine it was the extra salt. I wouldn't image why they would do that. Isn't that was the salt dispenser on your table is for?   My girlfriend ordered the Chicken pot pie and beware..that thing can serve (2) people so don't order it if you don't have someone to share with. When the waiter was serving it to us...everyone couldn't help but stare at how BIG that thing was.",

Tucked in the Venetian, this place has a good atmosphere, many tables, and is open 24 hrs a day, Vegas style. I got a seafood linguine and my date got the salmon which came with tons of mashed potatoes and green beans, though you could substitute those for other sides. Both dishes were very good and well portioned.   The price was 15-20 for most things I would say which is pretty good for a pretty classy place on the strip. Good for you budget Yelpers looking for quality eats and atmosphere!  Service was nothing special, though the food came pretty slowly.",

Through my previous stays in Venetian I always tried to eat outside of the hotel due to every other restaurant being $$$ but then discovered this cafe. The food is delicious, cafe is located right below the elevators and priced at about half to a third of the cost of room service!   As an added bonus they are open late & have takeout service.",

No its not my favorite restaurant but its my go-to place for many reasons: 1)Huge menu - when we cant decide or agree on what we want we end up coming here more times than not... something for just about everyone: steaks, burgers, pizzas, pastas,seafood,asian, mexican, and everything in between. 2)very good prices considering its a sit down restaurant in the Venetian 3)nice decor - Looks good amount more expensive than what it really is 4)Fast sitting times - I never made a reservation and came during peak hours but this is a huge capacity restaurant so never had to wait much at all to get seated 5)open 24/7 6)pretty good food - My fave is the chicken and waffles but you cant go wrong with the shrimp scampi",

Came in for some steaks after my friends got lucky at the blackjack table.  Our food was cooked to perfection and the size of the portions were just right. If it weren't for their damn good bread served at the beginning, we could've finished everything!  We also ordered the fried calamari, which actually includes fried onions, zucchini, and shrimp...if you go, this is a mandatory side dish, it's THAT good!  Service was phenomenal! I believe our server's name was Amanda (hope I got that right) and she was the best!  The only knocks on this place is that the AC was blowing a little too hard and cold at our table. So, as much as we were enjoying our food, my friends couldn't wait to get back out into the Vegas heat because it was that cold in the restaurant.  Also, the marble floors all around the dining area made for iffy footing for my friends wearing high heels.  Other than that, we enjoyed the Grand Lux Cafe and will be back whenever we come back to Vegas.",

The Grand Lux Cafe is conveniently located in the Venetian so I dined there more than once on my recent trip to Vegas.  It was a great place for both breakfast and dinner. Regrettably I never had lunch there...at least not yet.  For breakfast one of my friends ordered the chicken and waffles. She said the waffle was amazing but she was disappointed that the chicken was completely bland.  I guess it didn't taste as good as it looked. Another one of my friends and the steak and eggs and absolutely loved it.  I had a spinach and mushroom omelet that was served with hash browns. It was more than I could eat and was delicious.  For dinner I had the short rib grilled cheese. oh. emm. gee. It was heaven in my mouth. One of my friends ordered the same thing and she loved it as much as I did. My other friend ordered the burger and said it was the best burger she's had in a very long time. We were all so full that we didn't want dessert but when we saw the creme brulee duo on the menu it was a no-brainer - one chocolate and one regular. I'm usually more of a purist when it comes to creme brulee but both were amazing. I could have eaten both of them by myself but thankfully my two girlfriends saved me by helping me out.",

While they don't serve the exact same dishes, it's essentially the same type of food, portions and price.  Like most places in Vegas casinos, it can be difficult to find. It's on the casino level near the escalators that connect the casino floor to the Venetian Shops.   This is by no means a 'must eat' place in Vegas, but if you're nearby and looking for a meal that's better than Denny's but cheaper than Tao, then give this place a try.  If I was rating this place based off of my most recent visit, I'd only give them 2 stars because our food took forever to come out and when it did it was cold. But I generously gave them 3 stars because the other times I've been there this wasn't a problem. Perhaps it was the time of day when we visited. I think we got sat in our server's section just as she was about to get off.   Finally, other Yelper's said they had good pancakes, but sadly I didn't get to try them (despite my intense post Vegas night out cravings) because they stop making pancakes at 11am. But they do make Belgian waffles all day.",

The menu is massive, the portions were some of the biggest I've seen in Vegas (outside of a buffet) and it's the same selection of cheesecake.  But for me - that wasn't a problem, because I've never had any complaints about Cheesecake Factory. Our cab driver who took us to Mystere across the street at Treasure Island suggested we try this place. I'm glad he did because it was one of the most satisfying meals we had while we were partying. I ordered a spinach dip appetizer for the table and the chopped salad for my entree (which I couldn't finish it was so big!)  Service was prompt and attentive. It was a great base for our last night out in Vegas.",

Some of my favorites on the menu are the corned beef hash, chicken salad sandwich, or the patty melt.  This is one of those places where you really can't go wrong with anything.  It must be noted that from my experience, the service here is always top notch, waiters and waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.

It goes without saying that the deserts are sensational, but the dinner menu is just brilliant. They have two menus - the 'Skinny' menu (appropriately in a skinny format) if you're after healthier options and a regular menu. As others have said - very refreshing to have the option given that there are not a lot of veges involved in most fast food joints (potatoes being the main exception in the guise of fries of course!). We were surprised at the extensive range of things to choose from as well as the really very reasonable pricing. The hard part was trying to decide what to have! I had the fresh-made guacamole and it was hands-down the BEST I've ever had. My gf had Tuscan chicken off the skinny menu and he loved his as well. Servings are generous without being over the top. The atmosphere was great, nice little booths and they seemed to cater really well to families and large groups as well having a glance around us. Bathrooms exceptionally clean. Can't recommend this place enough, would love to eat there again...if only we had one were we live!",

For one visit, I think a 4 star rating is adequate for the food and service. I had a quesadilla and my mom had a shrimp basket. Both were good. The quesadilla was a little strange though. It was like a quesadilla that had the chicken and cheese between two soft pieces of bread, then there was a third hard piece of bread by itself.  The service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere was more intimate and formal feeling than Cheesecake's. Most of the meals ranged between $10 an $25 and the portions were huge. This is a great deal in Vegas!",

My friend was not coming in until later and I could not wait. I sat at the bar and Raven is a banging bartender. Super nice and friendly. She hails from Madison, WI. They only have Sierra Nevada, Stella and some other beer on tap. I had 2 Stellas. I ordered the buffalo wings and they came out quickly. The manager brought them out and you could tell he was customer service oriented. He asked me, \"Is there anything else I can get for you?\" The wings were not enough so I ordered the clam chowder w/ bacon and sourdough bread. The soup was poured where I was sitting and it was delicious. Creamy, not too much potatoes and you could see the clams and taste the bacon. I noticed other dishes coming out and they looked hearty. My bill came to $36 which was fine by me.  The restaurant seemed like it was for everybody. They had tables and stools in addition to being able to sit at the bar. You had a mix of 8 people sitting at a table, another guy at the 4 seat stool table on his computer to regular seating in the dining room. The full menu is available in the bar also.  At 3 in the morning after LAVO only the late night menu is available. I had the cuban sandwich, my friend had eggs and bacon and the girls had a salad (one is a vegetarian) and the other one had sliders. The bill came to only $67 including 4 non-alcohlic drinks.  I sat on the corner of the bar and noticed that all the servers were pretty cool and that they seemed to like their jobs. The foregoing is essential for good service. I will definitely come back here when I have the pleasure of staying at the Venetian.",

I thought it would be a typical restaurant - the menu seemed typical contemporary American - but my taste buds were definitely excited from this dinner.   **Note that the menu on Yelp is NOT complete. The menu at this restaurant is much longer and has way more options.*  I ordered the: (1) Shiraz, Rosemount Estate, Diamond Label, Australia $9.00. - This wine was very very smooth. Almost like water.   (2) House Green Salad - mixed greens and heirloom cherry tomatoes tossed in their roasted tomato carmalezied onion vinaigrette $7.50. - A very nice presentation with an excellent salad dressing. I was happy with ordering this salad.  (3) Cafe Beef Wellington - Filet Mignon Steak Medallions Covered with Crimini Mushrooms and Topped with Warm Puff Pastry; served with Madeira wine sauce, mashed potatoes and vegetables. - This was delicious!!! So so so good. I would definitely come back here to order this again. Eating the pastry with steak was just a delight and the sauce had just the right amount of kick.   Carli was our waiter and she was amazing. She was always prompt, very friendly and made me enjoy the meal even more. She deserves a raise! :)",

The restaurant itself is quite large, so even during the dinner rush we were seated within 5mins of putting our names down. Once we were seated, we spent  a good 10mins going through the pages and pages of the menu. Luckily, they served warm bread & butter to munch on while deciding on what to eat.   We all ended up choosing a 'medium plates', which was actually still too big for any of us to finish. My housemade pierogies were so delicious! Light, fluffy potato dumplings served on top of braised short ribs & mushrooms.. mmm. I also tried a bit of the kobe (softball-sized) meatballs in the creamy cheesy polenta which were also great. Our appetizer of wings were also moist inside with a nice crunchy exterior. Yum! Considering how much food they give, the prices are definitely reasonable and they are open 24/7, which is perfect for everyone in Vegas!",

The manager came over and offered soup, salad or fruit. I took the fruit. Mostly melon which I hate but not their fault I'm picky. Chicken was really crunchy but SO freaking salty I couldn't enjoy it. The waffle was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside but bland as hell. Ugh. Huge disappointment.

I don't know how a restaurant could get all the pastas so right but if you love pasta please come here!   I really meant I've never gotten anything off the menu I didn't like, which is saying a whole lot! It amazes me how I can order anything and be totally satisfied. I wish I could rate higher and I'm not generous with my ratings at all...this is my favorite restaurant!  I love the presentation of the food and the customer service.  There is one in the Palazzo and not only is this one much nicer, this location is open 24 hours. The food is presented better here, which is kind of weird.

He definitely made our experience here mucj more enjoyable unless yesterday's experience at yhe other Grand lux. Our glasses and mugs were never empty, the ketchup was thete without me asking for it, everything was cooked on point just how we wanted.  I highly recommend this restaurant for those that want breakfast at later hours. We found ourselves here at noon and they still had a reasonable selection of breakfast items.

I order a strawberry lemonade and an omelette. The bill comes to be $20, what a steal! The strawberry lemonade is too sweet for my taste, but it's still good after diluting it with some water. The omelette is also worth to try if you're an omelette fan and enjoy goat cheese.",

A few options of every category, including brunch!), but I really want to commend the service here.   One of my friends was, to put it politely, a little difficult to deal with. Our server was extremely patient and accommodating, especially with several tables of customers in similar states. Thank you for being so wonderful to a difficult crowd!",

    "text": "Let's just cut to the chase. I really like the Grand Lux Cafe. I mean I really, really dig this place!  Located inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino, the cafe is actually pretty easy to find just off the casino floor and near the escalators from the parking garage.   items of note..  - the room is MUCH larger than it first appears from the casino floor! With high ceilings and plenty of seating, the room is tastefully decorated and feels upscale. - Service is top notch here! At least it has been every time I have been here so far! For our last visit, Casey was our server and he was great!  -For being a food outlet a)on the strip and b)inside the Venetian, the prices are incredibly fair! It's a great way to enjoy a nice meal and not feel like you're breaking the bank! This was probably the biggest surprise of all! - the menu is HUGE! The amount of options available to you is fantastic! - this staff hustles! I mean servers and bussers were in constant motion tending to a guest or prepping a table for the next party!  - Casey was great about keeping drinks filled and checking in with us from time to time without being intrusive. It was perfect!  For this last experience, I ordered the rib eye steak(cooked medium rare) ($27). The steak was cooked almost perfectly! It was so juicy and tender and marinated beautifully! The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty tasty as well! The steak was so good that I decided to enjoy it without any steak sauce or ketchup(which I never do!)  I think this place is a real gem and I will keep returning to enjoy more of the menu! I teetered back and forth between 4 and 5 stars for this review, but given the price point and consistently good service, I have to give it a 5!   5 stars!",

First the waitress spoke so softly you could hardly hear her. She took forever just to bring waters and ordered the bus boy to bring them instead. My family and i went for lunch. We ordered three entrees. Two off the lunch specials and the chicken and shrimp jambalaya, which had no shrimp on it, from the regular menu. Now to clarify there is a lunch special that has just chicken jambalaya so we weren't overly upset about no shrimp. Note there is a huge price difference between the two. About $8. We couldn't bring it to the waitresses attention because she never came to check on us. Only would swoop by so quickly to grab a soda glass to refill and then rush off before we could even say excuse me. When the bill finally came, we told her about the mistake. She said nothing instead went to get a manager. The manager was the absolute worst! Not only was he insulting and insinuating that we lied about the shrimp, he offered no compensation what so ever. We weren't looking for a free meal. We just wanted the correct price. He was rude and obnoxious. Stay away from here. Robert was a complete jerk. How he became a manager is beyond me.",

It was about 10am and the person I was with said maybe we should share a meal and I agreed. I'm not a big fan of eggs Benedict but that's what we ordered. So when they came to the table the eggs weren't runny as they should be.   I didn't want to send them back but my travel partner insisted and I thought sending them back was a bad idea. You never know what people will put in your food once you piss them off. We got the second eggs Benedict and one of them was runny, I didn't eat that one and the muffin was burnt. The waitress came and asked how the food was and we mentioned how the muffin was burnt. She apologized and left our table and told the manager.  Well long story short my travel partner vomited twice within an hour. So the moral of this review is be nice to your waiter and don't send your food back. You should also watch the real funny movie \"Waiting\" with Ryan Reynolds. The waitress was so nice and even took the eggs Benedict of our bill.",

But I actually been to this place during normal hours and sometimes its good and sometimes its not. My first time I had their Shrimp Louie Salad and it was very good!

I was in the mood for some chicken and waffles, my daughter wanted salmon, my son wanted steak and my husband wanted pasta.  Bam!  Done!  Just like that!  We did share some pot roast cheese fries.  Yes, say it with me... pot roast cheese fries.  Delish!  This place definitely met all of our hunger needs and I'm sure we will return again to try another fraction of their ginormous menu.",

This is it, skip all your buffets and $150 dollar per person meals, come here and dine. The menu is long and detailed, from small to epic portions, everything is done right from 6 am to 9 pm. I have personally ate here 3 times while in those ungodly hours and everything is just done to perfection.   The breakfast buffet is a quick service option, most time is when my crew are here for CES, skip the wait, and go get your own food. The fruit is always the highlight, it's just better than the $33 dollars Caeser/Aria buffet.   If the place is packed, go eat at the bar, the service there is sometimes better.",

The restaurant itself was HUGE and we were kind of skeptical at first, because we had long written off Vegas as a foodie tragedy, but this cafe pleasantly surprised us. According to the waitress the bread was organic and made on site, all the sauces and salad dressings were made there and even the service was five star! This was my third visit to Vegas and my husband's many and both of us had a smile leaving this restaurant after our meal.   Price was right too.

The server was friendly and they were open late good...  The bad: at 4am - 12pm I was vomiting with diarrhea. Never before had I been so sick. I felt like a character in a movie; sleeping next to toilet because I couldn't go 15 min without vomiting, the pain was so intense I nearly called 911. I think the only reason I didn't was the lack of insurance.   By 1pm the pain finally stopped. I slept it off but it ruined my vacation. All week my throat was burning in pain from the acid. I've vomited before in my life but never like this; it was horrifying.   I called the restaurant where they tried to blame it on something else and used the phrase \"Well you didn't consult a doctor so how could you be certain it was caused by us\" oddly they said this before asking if I was okay! I hadn't eaten since 9pm the day before; it was the Lux. Someone in corporate relations left me a voice mail and I will update this review after I talk to them on the condition they do something. So far I am incredibly disappointed in how the manager handled the situation. I will be filling a report with the Nevada state health board. If you too got food poising always report it to the government agency; don't just rely on the restaurant. This morning (Sunday) I ran into a random person at the pool who ate at the Lux also Wed Morning and was also just as sick. They too were given the 'well you didn't consult a doctor did you...' story by a manager there. So stay away!",

They use huge chunks of corned beef, none of that stuff you get in a can! I shared some with my family and they loved it too! The eggs benedict was okay, I couldn't put my finger on what was missing. It may have been that the slice of ham was too thin or something was missing in the hollandaise. Regardless, the food was good enough to keep us coming back!   Try to get there before 9.

Grand Lux is pretty underwhelming on an objective level, sporting all the expected elements of a Cheesecake Factory-esque restaurant (giant menu, dim lighting, carbtastic breadbasket, etc.) with one great FIVE STAR exception: it's opened super late. Billions of kudos to the genius who decided to bring a menu of varying selections and super-sized portions to the extremely inebriated (one demographic in dire need of such a gift).   I have only been here after midnight and yes, that is when MAGIC happens. The waiters are usually fast, attentive, and accommodating. Once I ordered only a variety of BREADS. Another time, an egg white omelet. But of course the best part is people watching while the lighting is dim, your brain is fuzzy, and inevitable awkward eye contact with fellow diners awaits. My personal favorites include: girl who yakked into her napkin while her friends heartily consumed their meal, guy who got lost and walked by thrice, and girl who passed out face first onto a table.",

Later that trip, I ended up back at the Grand Lux Cafe and again, endulged on the same Crispy Caramel Chicken. My most recent trip to Vegas (3 years later), I once again couldn't pass it up. As I expected the memory of the dish exceeded it's actual quality, but it was still pretty tasty and reasonably priced. This restaurant does a great job of accommodating large groups, the food comes out fast and is easy on the wallet.",

    "text": "Its a 3.5 rating for me. Very close to 4;   Ryan and I were having a Mini Vacation out in Vegas December 14-17th; My friends always come to Vegas (my best friend is Dating someone from out there) and I had only been to Vegas once in my entire life for a little less than a day.   I decided that since I've stepped into this town without the faintest idea of what I'm doing, I'll holler at my friends who are no strangers. They suggested Grand Lux; I had never heard of this place before even though its a chain and I didn't even know it was part of the Cheesecake Factory family until I Yelped it (Like the good yelper I am, I referred to my iPhone app to spy on this place before diving in)* and was relieved to find that it got pretty good reviews.   We ate here twice. First time was yum nummy.  Lunch:  --Buffalo chicken rolls HOLY COW good;  --Ryan's Enchilada lunch special was very good --My chicken salad/house salad/chicken and mushroom soup was.. a little bland, it was okaaay, but It needed SOMETHING. Finished my salad the vinaigrette was good.   They have some pretty good lunch deals which are HUGE servings even for lunch. The Buffalo chicken rolls were soo good, I crave them all the time.   Dinner (the next day)  --Ryan got Crispy Caramel Chicken with Rice which was pretty good although we were a bit apprehensive about the caramel part.   ++Now here's where they lose points++ --I got the flat bread spicy chicken sandwich which was HORRIBLE! Bland Bland; Flat bread was tough and tasted like cardboard, chicken was bland and tasted like Subway \"roasted chicken\" the spicy mayo was gross and the fries were way too crunchy & COLD. I was so disappointed.   --Good thing I was able to get a little full from the Buffalo Rolls we ordered again.   It seemed like I got the short straw here.. My food was never that great, but Ryan's was waaay better. Almost like a different place. Put I do give it points for having some good things on the menu, but I have to take some away for being kind of inconsistent.   So I struggle with the stars here. I wouldn't kick GLC out of bed though. I'll come back here again because for two 21 year old struggling college students, the prices weren't bad at all. I'll come back. But I just wish the place was consistent.   **Yelp actually saved me from a lot of places out in Vegas. You could be a big name four star restaurant, but if Yelp gives you bad reviews I'm taking its word for it. I love Yelp.",

We went for an early dinner on Saturday night at the Venetian before heading to Jeopardy and were going to skip this place when we saw the mass amounts of people waiting to get in. They handed us a pager and said 5-15 minutes and we thought there was no way, but within 10 minutes we were being seated.   I had the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich that was heavenly. The chicken was super moist, the bun perfect.... it was perfectly flavorful, The fries were pretty damn good, too. I generally think fries are fries but these were crispy without being super oily. I was very pleased with my entire meal.   Mike had the Pasta Telephono. I'm going to cut and copy from the menu now: A Rich Tomato Sauce with a Dash of Cream and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Baked and Topped with Toasted Bread Crumbs. And yes, it was divine and we ate every single bite. Very yummy.   We decided to splurge on some dessert (although we barely had any room left...) and went for the Candy Bar Pie. HOLY CRAP. I wanted to be bulimic right about now to fit this sinful plate of sweet goodness in my belly.   Overall, a scrumptious meal worth every bite and every penny.   Bonus: the CES convention was getting out just as the Adult Entertainment expo was beginning-- so of course, I got my picture taken with a male porn star. Surgically implanted horns and all. Nothing like dinner and a show...",

After doing a little research, I found out that Grand Lux Cafe was actually owned by the same owner as The Cheesecake Factory. Figures, because their decor is pretty identical.  Anyway, their vast menu really gave me a headache. There was just too much to choose from. Shrimp scampi?! Barbecued pork sandwich?! Pasta with grilled chicken, tomato, basil, and mozzarella?! Enchilada?! They even had pho! It took me awhile to decide on the Madeira chicken, which was really good. It came with sauteed chicken breast with asparagus and mozzarella, topped with a mushroom-Madeira sauce. It was also served with a side of mashed potatoes. The chicken breast was surprisingly tender and the mashed potatoes were nice and creamy. It was pretty decent granted that it's a chain restaurant. I don't recommend that you get their pho though, my friend ordered it and it looked pretty gross. The bean sprouts and basil that was supposed to complement the pho were all wilted and browned. Pho would have been the last thing she would have ordered at an American restaurant, but she wanted some soup and there was nothing else soupy on the menu.   Our waitress was polite, but she didn't come by our table often. It was completely understandable, as she had a lot of tables to tend to.",

The ambiance and menu looked and felt strangely familiar until I saw the Carribean Skirt Steak, and instantly I figured the connection.   If Cheesecake Factory had an older sibling, GLC would be it. The menu items are different, but nevertheless it possesses the great quality of CF, and although the experience is not \"entirely\" new, it is an absolutely enjoyable variation... I love it.  GLC feels like it is a step higher than CF, or perhaps it's just the Venetian. So, if you like Cheesecake Factory, there is little doubt that you will love Grand Lux Cafe.",

We stopped in for an early dinner to get some food in our guts and water in our veins so I could start drinking. We ordered water from waiter David F. and he seemed to instantly peg us for poor people or something... Anyway, his attitude from that point was to ignore us throughout our entire meal.   Waiter didn't serve us our food, and someone else refilled our waters. The place wasn't busy, so I don't know where he was the whole time.   I ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt which was awesome. It was a spin on a regular patty melt, but was on parmesan bread instead of rye and had lots of melty cheddar. It was delicious.   My man ordered the spicy chcken on flat bread. It was ok, but not spicy at all and it didn't hold together well.   Stll no waiter.   Waiting. Getting pissed. Oh, here he is filling  our waters. Not looking at us, but instead scanning the rest of the place. What's he looking for? Someone to come pull up his sagging pants and comb ihis ridiculous hair? Gone again.   Comes back with the check. No talking, just drops it on the table. Meanwhile, I'm looking with envy at another table that has a good, attentive waiter.   I scratched out the tip section and was going to write a note telling him that if he wants tips he ought to engage his customers in small talk or at least be polite.   I almost complained at the hostess desk, but thought better of it. In rerospect, I feel bad not leaving a note explaining why he didn't get a tip, because know he probably REALLY thinks I'm poor (which I'm not).",

The differences are also evident in the two Grand Lux Cafe's for each hotel and casino.  We had a good experience at the other location at Palazzo the last time around, so we decided to come here for breakfast. There was a long line already at the front, waiting to get seated. On the left, there is a sign that says \"Grazie card\" members only. Skipped ahead of everyone and got seated right away. I could feel the seething stares at the back of my head.  I ordered the exact same thing from before, corned beef hash with scrambled eggs, extra crispy on the potatoes and corned beef. It was awesome, just as good as I remembered. Huge chunks of corned beef, with just the right amount of flavor, to go along with a mixture of diced onion and potato hash. Squirt some ketchup, and I was good to go.   My wife had the smoked salmon plate, and it was pretty darn good. We sat next to the breakfast buffet, which many people opted for around $16. I took a peek around, and it looked like your standard breakfast with sausage, bacon, and eggs. They did have a custom omelet station, but the lines were long. Overall, on the pricey side, of course.",

This pasta reminds me one of the Corner Bakery's pasta with breadcrumbs. (I can't recall the name).   I have also tried the Baby Back Ribs. Their portions are HUGE. So if you go with one person and have small appetite.... I say order one plate and share and get an appetizer.   I have also tried their Eggroll on their Appetizer Menu. The sauce to dip that came along was so tangy! Loved it. Pasta Pomodoro is also something to try!  5-star. Excellent service. Excellent Food. I love the decorations.

We always have breakfast here and even lunch when we're staying at our favorite hotel the Venetian.  The gals up at the front podium could use some friendliness training but the service staff have always been friendly, genuine and attentive.  Our first server Magaly S was super sweet, friendly and went the extra mile to make sure we were taken care of like family even though she looks like she's pretty far along in her pregnancy.  The food was even better than we could had done at home, hash browns extra crispy and the omelet was amazingly fluffy and well stuffed with our choice of ingredients.  Next morning, Aimee O took care of us in equally fantastic fashion.  The coffee might be $4.00+, but well worth it for it's smooth, flavorful roast.  Magaly S and Aimee O even got us  to-go cups of this rich blend which makes it really a super nice touch.  Well done, Grand Lux, this is just another reason why we always make the Venetian our destination hotel/casino.  We've been coming to Vegas for 30 years and have stayed in most every major hotel/casino, but this remains our favorite and no-brainer pick each time.",

We stayed at The Venetian so that was our biggest deciding factor on going here. Otherwise, I don't think this place would warrant traveling to another hotel for. They do get props for being open 24 hours though. I heard their breakfast is where its at, but I don't remember the last time I woke up during breakfast time in Vegas.",

    "text": "As far as Grand Luxe's go this one was  very good.   We came as a party of 8 on a Sat night and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, not too bad. The waiter came over promptly after we were seated and brought over some water and warm bread. Our orders were taken but then the waiting game began. It took over 30 mins for us to get our food. No one ordered anything too fancy (salads, pasta, salmon, etc) but we watched as tables around us that were seated after us got their food, ate, paid and left.   Everyone was very satisfied with their food though so I have to still give Grand Luxe credit. My chicken and avocado salad was very good: a large portion, lots of avocado, flavorful salad dressing. Other orders included the cedar planked salmon (always a crowd pleaser, my friend enjoyed it very much), the fried chicken, the gnocchi and pesto, spicy beef, and garlic shrimp pasta. No complaints about the food, the wait to get it was a doosy though.",

    "text": "First of all, I really like this restaurant!  It's like Cheesecake Factory.  In fact, I hear it's part  of the same umbrella company.    AMBIANCE: There are tons of booths which means anywhere you sit, you'll feel comfortable with your party.  Our wait on a Saturday night was only 15-20 minutes and I can see why because the restaurant is HUGE!  FOOD: Chicken Lettuce Wraps: Sauteed Chicken Breast and Vegetables in a Delicious Asian Sauce served with Cool Lettuce Wraps.  This came with what tasted like a hoisin sauce & a yellow horseradish sauce.  The horseradish sauce was good... tangy with a kick.  This platter is huge.  I went with two other girls and after we each had about 2-3 lettuce wraps, we were almost halfway full.  Southwestern Salad: Chicken Breast, Fresh Corn, Black Beans, Tortilla Strips, Avocado and Pepper-Jack Cheese Tossed in a Honey-Lime Vinaigrette.  Everyone RAVES about this dish.  It's under the \"LARGE SALADS\" section and it is huge.  I do not recommend that you eat this by yourself, piggy.  The only bad thing was that the avocados weren't ripe enough and thus, a little firm.  Miso Glazed Salmon: Served with Rice and Stir-Fried Vegetables.  This was very well marinated but a little on the sweet side.  Rice will make you full so you should just eat all the fish!  It's not under or over cooked.... just right!  SERVICE: I was very disappointed with our server: Lori H.  She was only semi-friendly compared to how much more friendly she was with her other tables with older patrons.  What?  Does she think young Asian girls can't afford to eat there?  Sheesh!  I know this kind of place usually appeals to chain lovers (yuck) but for some reason, it's nice to go to a big place with huge portions once in a while.  It's like a food splurge.",

I was only disappointed that it didn't come with eggs or bacon or the usual breakfast sides, so I had to order those items a la carte, which turbo boosted my bill.

The waiter was nice enough to give us some time to figure out what we wanted because so many things sounded so good on their menu. Luckily there's complimentary bread to help hold us over.   We ended up with a glass of wine each and he had the salisbury steak and I had the prime rib. Both dishes came out fairly good and the sides were good also, which makes this dinner a winner.   This cafe is a little more expensive than what you'd find at other hotel/casino cafes but their quality of food is better. Our 2 dinners, 2 glasses of wine and a side salad came out to about $75",

We had the french fries.. eh,  they were a little different than cheesecake, but almost the same. They weren't as crisp as we usually get at cheesecake factory. The portion was small, and they cost 4.50.. still better than most other diner cafes at this hour.  The boston cream pie was decent..   The burgers sounded good, and knowing they're good at the cheesecake factory, they better be damn good here. They also have a nice selection of steaks. We were too full to try them, but I wasn't too impressed by this place.   I'd only come here for late night..",

Out of curiosity, noted this to the staff and they acknowledged that it was a problem. Dinner - nothing to write home about. It was OK. Not very flavorful - bland. As were leaving, we made a friendly and light-hearted comment to a gentleman, who appeared to be the manager, regarding the slippery and greasy floors. The irate and condescending response was not something I was expecting. Apparently the grease makes it way from the kitchen on the serves shoes. I have NEVER seen this before. If you go there, out of desperation for food late night, please don't ask any questions regarding the place - or risk the wrath of some irate manager.",

    "text": "We ate here twice and loved it both times. I normally seek out unique foodie experiences and avoid chain restaurants like the plague, so naturally I assumed when the family wanted to go that I would have to settle for it. Boy was I wrong...  The first visit we went for brunch (Sunday am, seated right away). Two of the kids got Belgian waffles with strawberries and whip, the other, the Italian Market Sandwich. The waffles were good, but the sandwich was amazing. My son generously offered each of us a small bite and agreed it was the best sandwich ever!  \"Thinly Sliced Prosciutto, Pepperoni and Salami, Topped with Fontina Cheese and Arugula on Rustic Bread with Sun-Dried Tomato-Basil Aioli\". My husband and I both ordered the egg breakfast which was prepared well and included Niman Ranch bacon. The orange juice was fresh squeezed (really, not like other restaurants advertise), and the fresh fruit actually ripe and flavorful. We were very impressed with the quality of the food, but also the inventiveness of the menu- not your standard chain restaurant fare. Everyone was very happy all around.   After much debate about where to go for dinner  (we were there to go to Dos Caminos or Bouchon), we all decided to go here again. We ordered: a BLT (yummy bacon and bread), the Max Burger (has short ribs on it), Sunday Night Pasta (daughter said it was the best past she has ever had), Chop Salad (the only average meal we ordered), and a Top Sirloin steak w/fries ( I had my heart set  on steak frites, but every restaurant in Vegas starts steak at $40 + $9 fries- ridiculous!) The steak was tender, flavorful, and well cooked. At $28 for the 8oz steak and $4.95 for the fries I was very pleased).   Again, a great experience all around. Bravo to Grand Lux for bringing quality dining at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is fine, and simply elegant (but really, does every restaurant have florescent lights now?), but a bit noisy. Compared to fancier places with big names and higher checks, this exceeded our other experiences.",

No one at my table had any complaints so I guess that's a good thing. I think it was a good all ages / family restaurant...we didn't have kids with us but I saw some in there for those who are curious. I would recommend this place for quality food late at night.",

Then I ordered the fish and chips which were melt in your mouth crispy deliciousness on a plate. :) I don't even remember what my boyfriend got, I was too busy savoring the fish and their homemade tartar sauce.

They have a huge menu with a large selection of meals, so it catered to all types of eaters and the different cravings you would have for each day of the week and time of the day. They have different menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner, evening, and even late night.  This is one of the only places open 24 hours a day!  The portions are great and the food is decent. It's hard to go wrong with this place. Also service is quite good here and on-par with service in restaurants around the hotel. Breakfast here was kind of disappointing, with small portions and expensive prices. So I suppose the prices are sort of inflated, no surprise since you're within Venetian, but the it's not as inflated as other restaurants and the foot is still pretty good.  I had Salmon Carpaccio the first night and that was really good, but some what expensive $22 - $24 ( I don't remember right now). And the following day had your standard breakfast like scrambled eggs, toast, hash brown, ham and that was something like $18. Which was totally not worth it for me.  All in all, I'd return!",

I guess I made the mistake of getting food to-go at night since I wanted to take it back to my hotel room.

The fresh whipped cream that came with the Belgian waffle was really good!  The second day, we came for the breakfast buffet. They have an omelet bar, waffles, different pastries, eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, cereal and fruit. You also have the option to get 2 drinks. The omelets were quite hearty.   The waffles are incredible! I would go back just for them. They were perfect with a little bit of syrup and some sliced strawberries. They had the perfect amount of crispness!   The service tends to be a bit slow at times since the restaurant is so busy. But like I said. Those waffles are worth it!!!",

I was hungry and this cafe was right downstairs immediately across from the slots!   Walked right up the counter and the hostess lead my lady and I over to a table. The decor inside of the restaurant is really nice. The lighting is good and I did not smell any hints of smoke while here which was nice.   The meal was good. The fries were on point!!! I would liked for the burger to have been bigger considering the cost of the burger but I guess you can only wish, EVEN in VEGAS!!!  My next experience there was roughly the same. Had a different server and was seated a bit closer to the entrance which was a nice change instead of in the back corner.   The meals were both cooked to my liking. As far as portions, I always say BIGGER is better but apparently other people and businesses do not always see it that way.   #eatup #haveabrew",

Half the restaurant is in the mall area. Another portion is by the bar. And there's a light airy seating area by the windows. Definitely ask for the window seating as the bar seating was very dour and drab. I had the chicken enchildas which had an interesting moele (spelling?) sauce. The lady had salmon which was excellent.

Another tidbit is that they are actually owned by The Cheesecake Factory so if you're getting that vibe well now you know.   I haven't seen this place overly packed but they do try to service to you as soon as they can. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and I had no problem with them whatsoever.   I do recommend eating the Pasta Carbonera; with chicken it is a hefty $20 but you are at the casino so you can always win that back. The pasta was cooked well and the flavors were amazing. Yes, it does read that the pasta is imported. However, I asked the waiter and he stated that they are not imported per say. It's more on the ingredients that make the pasta was imported. Tricky tricky haha! By the time I was finished, I had leftovers and no room for dessert but I do hear there's a great dessert place in the Grand Canal Shoppes ;)",

This was all really odd because the restaurant was pretty empty and there were a LOT of staff around not doing much.

There was plenty of staff to wait on customers.  The restaurant is much bigger than it looks.  There is about a 20 ft line of people with a sign that says 5-7 minutes from here.  I would say we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  There was one customer loitering around the hostess station that looked kind of angry.

She was quick to give us our bill and not know we exist afterwards.  Drinks: They have a full bar and serve bloody marys.  Food: Asian Nachos: Fried round wonton with sweet sauce, little bits of chicken, and chopped peanuts. I would not get this again. Way too sweet.  Turkey Salad: The pieces of turkey were obviously lunch meat, chopped salad was ok. Large chunks of cheese.  Sunday Pasta: Good serving, Ok.  Beef Wellington Cafe: Well worth $20. 4 small pieces of beef with a small puff pastry on top, mashed potatoes, Brussel Sprouts, Steamed beans. - I would order this again.  Notes: Open 24hrs.",

The food is pretty high quality and fairly priced.   We're always seated quickly and served immediately. The service is always friendly and cordial.   Tonight, we came here after a horrible experience at Homestead Steakhouse at Ceaser's (don't go there if you want steak, ever) and we were satisfied, just as we were the past two visits.   I'm on a no-carb diet and they were accommodating every time. I ordered a burger with no bun and they even wrapped it in lettuce for me! Same with the chicken sandwich, which was phenomenal. Plus, they've got a great happy hour menu!   At the Grand Lux, you get pretty damn good food at a low price. With all the places to eat in Vegas, it's gotta say *something* that we've eaten at least three meals here.",

It's not overpriced, the menu is extensive, portions are large, and most importantly, everything is delicious- a rarity these days. It's not a fine dining experience but many of their items are completely crave-able (ie. the Asian Nachos I had twice in three days-wtf is in those things...I want more as I write this). The place must be doing ok given there are two within about 100 yards of each other.   Definitely worth a stop if you are not in need of a fancy meal and/or have less experimental eaters with you (or are clearly addicted to the Asian Nachos).",

And that's fine if you want a coffee that's included but no juice.  Bacon, sausage, etc. all pork meat choices, no beef or turkey substitutes. And we, along with probably half the world's population don't eat pork. So we were left with eggs, toast, muffin and hash browns. And they were all prepared very well.   Our server Joe, took it upon himself to take his pick of an 18% gratuity. Something normally only done with a group of diners. That was this past Saturday, 3/12/16. I guess Joe didn't think we'd give him a decent tip.  On the other hand, the following morning breakfast experience was much nicer. 3/13/16, with an upbeat waitress whose name escapes me; the bubbly and friendly redhead with a smile. Same breakfast choices as the previous morning. And when presented with the bill, the customer's suggested tip options of 15%, 18% and 20% were there for the customers choosing. Something totally absent the previous morning Joe. This wonderful server received the 20% gratuity. She truly earned it.",

She made us feel completely welcome, and offered up her favorite items on the menu (the menu is rather large, so this helped a LOT!) I decided to go for the Chicken and Waffles,(one of my favorite dishes) and a Peach Bellini. The Bellini was okay-I'm not a HUGE fan of frozen drinks(it didn't specify that it was frozen on the menu), but the chicken and waffles were OUTSTANDING. Huge portions, and great food for a fraction of what you would pay elsewhere in Vegas. I will DEFINITELY return next time I'm in town!",

The waiter was very nice and allowed me to substitute the side of fries with the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was perfectly creamy, not too overwhelming.

She kept a smile and was beyond patient with all of our questions. Being that I have been in the service industry for years, I understand that everyone has \"bad\" days, but not here every employee was smiling and kind. I even pulled the manager to the side at the end and told him how grateful we were that we had finally had wonderful service in Vegas. Kuddos to this restaurant for picking am amazing staff and hats off to the cooks because the food was delicious . Definately will be back to Vegas in June and will be coming back with a request to have Betty as our server. Thank you for a perfect experience.",

It was around noon, so everyone was out getting lunch at the time. Also, there was an annual meeting for AAOS at the Venetian, and everyone had decided to go eat at this restaurant. However, the wait was only about seven minutes, which was awesome!  We decided to try the lunch specials, but we were concerned that the portions would be small since normally at a nicer restaurant like that, their portions are not filling.   I ordered the Lunch Rustic Pizza and Salad ($11.95) with a Mango Margarita ($10.75). My friend got the Lunch Chicken Special-Chicken Parmesan (~$12.95) with a Strawberry Margarita (also $10.75).   When our plates came out, we were shocked at how much food we were given. We were full by the end of our meal. Would this be filling for the average-sized man? Probably not. But it is a good-sized portion for the price.  The only cons are that we had to ask for our complimentary bread, which our waitress brought out right away (she was great!), and the margaritas were a little flavorless in my opinion. The next time I go, i would opt out on the margaritas.",

After walking around hunting for the next best thing we settle for Grand Lux Cafe. I started off with the Ahi Ceviche: Fresh Raw Ahi Tuna Diced and Marinated in Lime Juice, Chiles and Cilantro. Tossed with Avocado, Tomato, Onion and Cucumber. This was such a refreshing and delicious dish for summer. It looked so appetizing that I forgot to take a picture of it. The appetizer was pretty hearty and you could definitely have the Ahi Ceviche as your meal. For my entree I ordered the Sonoma Saladwith Crispy Greens, Grilled Chicken, Avocado, Bacon, Fresh Corn, Sweet Dates, Golden Raisins, Onions, Goat Cheese and Glazed Walnuts. Tossed with our Hazelnut-Mustard Vinaigrette. Since it was 100+ degrees in Vegas I stuck with light dishes which turned out to be very filling. My colleague ordered a pasta and thoroughly enjoyed her entree as well. The service was quick and it was fun people watching it everyone in the casino.",

I should have taken that as a bad sign and ordered something else.  But no, I had to get steak and I hated myself for it.  I think they completely forgot to season the steak. It was just meat without any sort of flavor. It was also overcooked.  Not very impressed.",

Every once and a while, I get a strong craving for a good old fashion joe...you know the ones that were served in elementary school.   The meat was okay. Nothing to rave about. It could have been ground beef for all I know.   The sloppy joe could have been improved in two ways: 1) more sauce and 2) hamburger bread. I did not enjoy eating a dry sloppy joe on a toasted piece of bread.   Towards the end, my entire party crashed, while I handled the bill. Service was friendly but a bit slow.

We were seated very quickly and given water and bread right away. I already knew I wanted calamari, so we ordered that once we were seated.   It took us a while to decide what we wanted since the menu had a big variety. I guess that's why the website says \"something for everyone!\" So True!  We finally decided upon the Crispy Caramel Chicken because it just sounded so good! \"Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken Breast in a Spicy Thai Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. Served with Rice.\"  The calamari came and it wasn't just calamari. It also came with Rock Shrimp, Zucchini and Onions. Served with a couple dipping sauces. It was all so crunchy, just the way I like it! I loved that they added in the shrimp, zucchini, and onions. It made it all the more better!  The caramel chicken came and we were ecstatic! IT looked just as it was described in the menu, maybe even better! Our first bites had us melting in our seats, it was so tasty! The chicken was breaded perfectly and the Thai sauce was just delicious! It didn't have too much ginger either, which is a surprise since a lot of dishes with ginger tend to have chunks of it.   All in all, perfect experience! The portion was perfect to share, we didnt even finish, so we had some yummy leftovers the next day :)",

This time we had the Sunday Night Pasta. Definitely large enough to share. My wife and I split it and didn't finish the plate. She started with a salad and I started with a cup of clam chowder. Let me tell you about the the clam chowder!! Easily the best bowl of chowder I have ever had. Strong herb flavors with a healthy helping of potatoes and clams. Delightful!  Anyway, definitely recommend the Sunday Night Pasta. It is like spaghetti on steroids with beef short ribs AND ground beef! Spaghetti pasta was well cooked and it all wrapped up to be a great meal.  Do it. Don't debate it, just do it!",

I ordered the Cafe Beef Wellingtons. The steak was flavorful and medium rare just the way I asked! The dish was full of lightly sweetened vegetables (brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, and carrots) to offset the semi salty filet medallions.   Although the entree was good, the dessert wasn't as up to par. My sister went with the chocolate molten lava cake served with vanilla ice cream. It was presented beautifully. However, the ice cream was extremely frozen to the point where you had to struggle just to get a spoonful. Fudge exploded from the middle just the way it should be, but there was barely any cake. The outside did not have the consistency of a cake. Rather, it was more like a chocolate cookie. The lining was very chewy, while the outside was hard.  Besides the food, service was friendly from the moment we walked in till the moment we left. Everything was done in a very timely manner!",

Because if you don't know what to eat, then this is your best choice.  They have an extensive menu, just like the one you would find at a Cheesecake Factory, but even bigger!  I love how you have options in every category of cuisine, and know that you will find something to your taste with the confidence that it will taste good.   And if it doesn't, you can always count on their endless list of small plates and appetizers, and their super yummy warm bread available in both white and wheat!  When I come here I usually order a salad because their huge and it gives me the opportunity to eat about 3 baskets of bread.  I would have to admit that I actually come here for the bread.  But their lettuce wraps, egg rolls, and their Ahi Tuna Salad are some of my other regular orders because their good too.  But if you need to load up on some good carbs, and you love butter, come hither to Grand Lux to rid of your hangover after the nightlife on this strip because this joint will be definitely open and ready to serve!

    "text": "Since we were staying at the Venetian on our last trip to Las Vegas, it makes logical sense that we ended up eating at the Grand Lux Cafe. In fact, after wandering around the casino one night we even discovered that there are two spread out between both the Venetian and Palazzo hotels. Our experience dining at the Venetian Grand Lux Cafe was overall very good as we were able to get seated right away and the quality of our food was perhaps even better than expected. We began with buffalo chicken egg roll appetizers, which were incredible and highly recommendable as a starter that would also pair well with beer. I decided to order a garlic shrimp pasta dish and my partner in crime ordered a strip steak--both meals that I wouldn't say we order on a regular basis when we go out to eat. Once our food came out, we were very impressed as my pasta tasted incredible and his steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned exquisitely. It actually made me happy that we ended up at Grand Lux Cafe rather than a steakhouse, where he would have definitely paid $50.00 for a steak that would have been similar in quality.   Overall, good service, great food, decent atmosphere, and prices that are better than some of the other more high-end restaurants within the Venetian/Palazzo means that if you find yourself staying at either of these hotels, I would recommend stopping by Grand Lux Cafe. The menu is large enough that if you find yourself in a big party, everyone should be happy eating here. And of course it is centrally located within the casino, which for Las Vegas is another plus.",

I'm really disappointed that the service staff doesn't even care after we asked a couple of times why our food hasn't come yet and why it took 1.5 hours to receive our drinks.

The menu at the Grand Lux Cafe is pretty similar to that of the Cheesecake factory, but with some different dishes as well. We came here a couple weeks ago and were not disappointed. This was the cheapest meal we had in Vegas that weekend, and one of the better meals. Service was fast and friendly, and we will definitely be coming back in the future.",

Strongly disapprove of the pricing too - $5.95 for a little wine glass of orange juice? Why don't you just go club a baby seal while you're at it.   I got the lunch salmon - grilled salmon served on a bed of mashed potatoes surrounded by some sad looking string beans. Not much to get excited about - everything was average except for price and how long it took to cook.",

The pasta was surprisingly cooked to perfection.  Just to be overwhelmed by the sauce.  Oh, so close yet so far.  Shaking beef and caramel chicken combo was ok.  Chicken's taste was overwhelming and nothing special.  The beef was quite good but, in total contrast to everything else at this place, gave a tiny portion. My family loves this place so I will probably be back. Unfortunately.",

Sooo, if you can't tell, I really like this place.  I go to Vegas more than is healthy (it's only February and I have already been 3 times, with my fourth trip next weekend).  A golden standard for decently priced, very tasty, and open really really late for post party food.  I love grand lux, especially their mini hot dogs and their surprisingly good renditions of asian inspired dishes.  One word of warning: the dishes are huge.... but you get leftovers for late night snacking or early hangover brunch (if you are like me, I don't like waking up until 2-3pm post party night).  Next time you are in vegas, try this place out, or if you are lucky, there is one in LA too.",

I don't think the food here is quite as good though, but it does have the benefit of being open 24/7 so it was exactly what my party was looking for when we rolled in at 2 am in the morning. The late menu is a bit limited (two pages only). I got the Chili-Lime Chicken and Mango Salad which was sort of missing the Chili-Lime flavor part, but they substituted the romaine lettuce for spinach at no extra cost which was nice. I also wish there were more actual bits of chicken in my salad (they were so tiny and hard to find you almost had to squint at the dish to identify them.) I also tried my friend's Crispy Fried Wontons which had great Asian inspired flavors but were SOO salty. Personally I think the Cheesecake Factory is better. Great service though, they brought out a cute little desert for my friend who's birthday it was.",

Naturally, after driving to Vegas (we were only coming from Los Angeles) we were hungry and thrilled to had found a Grand Lux.  All the food was as delicious here as it is at the location in Los Angeles.  Our waiter was friendly. He didn't seem to have very much personalities, he seemed like one those waiters who wanted to keep the dignity of the place. The decor is as if its such a fancy place, and he acted as if he knew he worked for a GRAND establishment and he was keeping up the proper persona. Nevertheless, he was very friendly and listened properly to our order.  I'll be back Grand Lux, I love you!  (btw we ordered the same thing we always do - the breakfast sandwich)",

    "text": "I went to Vegas with my husband a couple of years ago and we ate here. I had never had chicken and waffles before, and I don't know what compelled me to order it, but I did.  Since then, I have ordered chicken and waffles at countless other places. Nothing, NOTHING, comes even close to theirs. I dreamed that one day, we would cross paths again! When I finally found myself in Vegas again, the ONE thing I really wanted to do was go the the Grand Lux Cafe and eat chicken and waffles. Everyone who was with me on my second trip to vegas I have converted everyone to a chicken and waffle loving maniac.  My friends got huevos rancheros (amazing), pancakes (amazing), chilaquiles (amazing).  My only complaint about this place is that their cappuccinos are awful.",

Had their chicken and waffles during the first visit. The chicken was perfectly crisp and juicy; the perfect compliment to the light and fluffy waffle. I wish I had been able to finish it. For night number 2, I had developed a strange craving for soup. Had a generous bowl of the vegetable and loved it from the first bite to the last. Probably some of the best veggie soup I've had...ever. Might have been the alcohol talking, but I stand by my judgement. Will be in Vegas a few more times soon, so I'm keeping this place in mind if I need a late night fix.",

At first, we were just going to order off the menu instead of going to the small buffet, but when you add your beverages, the price is virtually the same. The buffet includes your drinks and an orange juice was $5.95 so we decided to go with the buffet. Small but mighty, it did not disappoint! Made to order omelettes, incredible waffles, a big selection of fresh fruit and pastries, and 3 different kinds of hearty breakfast meat! It was seriously so good for standard breakfast food! Yes it was slightly pricey but it was more than average and great service!",

First time I was here, I wanted some comfort food that reminded me of home since we didn't check into the hotel till 2am!  I ordered their Zen Chicken Noodle Soup ( americanized version of pho).  Let me say, not good! The dish was presented nicely, with the soup coming out separately in a saucer, but I was very disappointed with the taste of it.  The chicken were all sliced chicken breast.  Ugh, I should've known better not the order noodle soup here.  I mean, some of their other Asian dishes are good, so I wanted to give it a try.  Nope, wrong!   However, the server recommended the crispy shrimp and chicken rolls, which tasted excellent!  It was hot and crispy, and had a side of a tangy sauce.    Recently came here again and we ordered he rolls again, along with an order of their oversized burger and 2 pastas.  Dinner was delish and cheap! Left as a happy camper and would most likely come back again if I was staying at the hotel.",

The decor is beautiful, the seating was a nice booth and we enjoyed the ambiance. We shared the mashed potato spring rolls and were pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of this appetizer. They are delicious, reasonably priced and plentiful. We then shared the roast turkey and brie sandwich...again, delicious and nicely sized. Also reasonably priced. The strawberry lemonade was a wonderful blend of what seemed to be real strawberry puree and good lemonade. We got more than enough to eat by sharing each dish and walked out spending less than $40, including 20% tip. All in all, a complete winner. We would happily eat there again.",

    "text": "2.5 Stars...I have been a fan of The Grand Lux Cafe for many, many years (15+ actually) and my most recent visit was a bit disappointing.  The food and wait staff remains good as ever, but the management was what let me down.  We were in town over the weekend for our annual basketball tournament and our team of families are very close knit which means dining together and having fun.  I called in advance to make a reservation for a large party of 35 (their website states that they do take them) but I was told that due to the day and time which was a Saturday morning 11:30am and peak time for them (according to the mgr) they could not and would not accept reservations.  We chose to walk-in together, but each family got their own tables.  Keep in mind all thirty five of us walked in together giving our names and party number one right after another.  They seated us sporadically so we were far apart from each other, not fun.  What I was upset about was clearly seeing two areas that were completely empty and could have easily accommodated us.  If a restaurant has a 550 seat capacity, how difficult would it be to put 35 people together especially when there is clearly room available?  Due to this, I have decided that we will dine at other establishments as a team (see my Nora's Italian Cuisine review) when we return for our yearly tournaments.  There are plenty of restaurants who can accommodate us.",

I'm not sure which is better, but the food here was amazing, so I think we made a good choice.  Atmosphere:  Beautiful cafe in the Venetian hotel, we sat in the outside patio area and people watched while we ate.  The customers are the usual eclectic Vegas mix of business people,  groups of friends, and couples.  We enjoyed watching people hurry by with rolling suitcases while others are wearing shorts and t-shirts while drinking beers and giant margaritas.  Service:  Quick, attentive, and on point.  We got our food quickly and our waters were refilled often.    Food: Huevos Rancheros:  I'd say this is the best I've had, it was flavorful, tasty, and the portion size was huge!  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were seasoned so well.    I can't remember what my bf got, but it was a vegetable omelette of some sort, he liked it, but liked mine better I think.    Overall:  Huevos Rancheros are great here.",

    "text": "Our group ate here are three different occassions from the same weekend trip and although it was only great two out of three times, I still loved this restaurant enough to give it five stars. Let me tell you, the service has a lot to do with it.   First trip was during a late dinner after arriving at the Venetian. Menu was HUGE, as in Cheesecake Factory-esque HUGE. My fab buddies shared their Asian nachos which we all swooned over. My shrinking beef was a bit of a disappointment in that it was mostly onions and green onions rather than beef. What saved this dinner for me was our server Julian. Even through the drunken antics of the guys, he was gracious and continued to serve our party extremely well.  Word of advice: Skip the \"breakfast buffet\" Totally not worth the $16-something price on it. Not enough selections and the quality was mediocre at best. I was really disappointed with it. Just order from the regular breakfast menu.",

    "text": "Reading some fellow Yelp reviews I persuaded myself to check out the Grand Lux Cafe since I was visiting Las Vegas for a week and staying at the Venetian. I ended up coming here for food time and time again.   I drive past the location at the Beverly Center all the time and never once thought about going to eat here. Well, I dove in and was pleasantly shocked. The food was all delicious from the appetizers and full meals I ordered along with all my guests. We loved it so much we came back twice more during the week.   The place is open 24 hours, always has cute hostess (no servers I found), has reasonable prices for Vegas Casino inflation, and has huge portions. The bread they bring your table isn't shabby either and one thing is guaranteed that you will walk out of here feeling like you just tackled every item at a Vegas Buffet.   The concept here is to put you on the brink of a food coma so you plant yourself at a roulette game after eating and you just play for hours because you cannot move.   The only thing that stopped this place from going 5 star is the slow service. The place is always busy so if your in a hurry to dine then steer somewhere else. If you have a minute to kick back and recycle some energy then this is your place.",

There seems to be a more regal air to it though since it is in Vegas.  There is ample seating and I love the high ceilings. It made it seem like it was an even bigger restaurant than it already was.  FOOD The food was delicious. I ordered the SHRIMP SCAMPI WITH ANGEL HAIR PASTA, which was way more than enough for 2 people.  That's the great thing about this place: the portions are HUGE so you can easily split food amongst you and your friends.  I expected the dish to be very salty, but it was actually cooked perfectly! The shrimp was plump, succulent, and had a little crispiness to it that was unexpected but tasty. The sauce was divine and the diced tomatoes complemented the dish perfectly. The pasta was cooked just right and balanced the dish's flavors.  I would definitely come back again because: a) It's convenient (located in the Venetian) b) They serve tasty and high quality dishes c) They are generous with portions!",

They are a bit flexible (which is good when you are up until 5am) so we tend to roll in at 10:45 or so.    I highly, highly recommend their Brioche French Toast, I think I almost passed out at the table from ecstasy.  I get the French toast with sauteed bananas and pecans, however I suggest the caramel sauce on the side because it is SUPER sweet.  It is a huge portion and could be split easily with another person.    Their breakfast menu is pretty reasonable being anywhere from $9-$12 for a sit down breakfast and their buffet being $16.50.    Drop in here for a good morning after full belly, you wont regret it.  It is located in the Venetian right near the Phantom Theater.",

Vegetable Pizza: yummy yummy in my tummy!  Only \"Con\" They don't serve the molten chocolate cake here!   CHOICE: Venetian or Palazzo?

The boss and I went here for lunch finally without feeling rushed and having to washed down everything within 5 min. and run back to the booth and hopes it digest! We made the effort to get replacements so that we can finally have a civilized sit down lunch for once!   We sat next to this sweet elder couple who was enjoying their lunch. I was sold when I saw what the man was eating. A bowl of chili with this scrumptious corn bread and I just had to have it! I wanted the chilis but wasn't sure how that was going to sit in my stomach for the next 6+ hours so decided not to get that. Instead, went for this shaky beef and I swear they had chopped down every scallions in the fridge because my plate was loaded with scallions and onions. Let's just say that after lunch, I was literally brushing my teeth and tongue with altoids.   But OMG, the cornbread was divine! It was so moist, it was like eating a moist sweet yellow cake with corn kernels. It was so moist, that it had to be eaten with a spoon because it kept falling off my hands. But it was the best cornbead i've ever eaten.   The service was decent, the environment was very similar to the cheesecake factory except it's not a chain restaurant? Er, at least I don't think it is.   Another reason I find it endearing is because when I got up to use the restroom, the nice elderly couple asked my boss if I was her daughter. My boss said no but sometimes she has to play the role of a mommy to me. Well, the lady complimented me and said that I was very pretty. *Blushed*",

After 130 reviews for the Grand Lux, I can only add that I think this is one of the finest Casino/Hotel cafes in Las Vegas.  The Venetian goes the extra mile to ensure that this dining experience is as good as any other in the hotel - even though the price is much less than some of their gourmet facilities. The service is excellent. I had to wait on a second draft beer for a while - and the manager brought another to me \" on the house.\" \"We apologize for the wait\" ......Excellent treatment   Supurb food........

I had a breakfast plate for $6 that came with ham, eggs, toast, fruit, some butter. It kept me full until lunch around 2pm and I had their Miso Salmon for $11 and it was well worth it. I had to stuff myself just to finish it. They gave me two half slices of salmon which was tender but a little dry with stir fried vegetables, mixed rice with some teriyaki soy sauce drizzled over it. Sounds simple but it sure was better than the Miso Salmon at Cheesecake Factory and definately worth it for half the price.  The decor is more upscale and matches the Venetian but less gaudy. Don't expect peace and quiet since it is loud as a cafeteria. The wait was not bad either compared to Cheesecake.",

It's nearly impossible to have a peaceful, easy lunch there without the place being ridiculously busy and having to wait an hour. But what if there was a place with Cheesecake Factory food, minus the hoards of tourists??   Lo and behold, that is Grand Lux Cafe. It really is too bad it's in Vegas and I only frequent that town about every other year. The food was delicious, and arrived quickly. We had good service, even though we sat in the bar. It absolutely reminded me of Cheesecake Factory in the menu options and flavors. The only sad thing was that I wasn't able to eat all my pasta and I wasted it, since we left the next morning.   Okay, okay, I'll admit it, we visited this place after midnight and a bottle of wine. But honestly--it's really good. I'm sure it wasn't just the wine.",

I've been here a few times and have had the fusilli pasta, the fish and chips, but the most recent discovery here is the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.   I've never had chicken and waffles from other places so I have nothing to compare it to but it was SO GOOD here! The chicken  is similar to chicken strips and are placed over a waffle. The best thing about it is the maple-butter syrup. OMG it must be so bad for you (what isn't here?) but it is so freakin good. I never would have thought sweet, syrupy chicken would taste so good with a waffle.   The breakfast cocktails were also very good. Peach bellini, mimosa, and a pomegranate cocktail. They were on the sweeter side, which I like, but might not have enough booze for some.   Although it's not a buffet, it is definitely a place to get your feast on. Portions are HUGE and I feel like they can actually serve 2. Prices are very reasonable (This place is from the founders of The Cheesecake Factory) for Vegas.   On my next Vegas trip, I'm definitely coming back for the chicken and waffles. YUMMY!!",

I will definately go back to try other items on the huge menu.  You may call me a man-whore, but that Creme-Brulee is mine everytime!",

The food is good.  The prices are high, but you do get a lot of food.  Mixed opinions about the staff.  One time I was here the waiter was a real ass.  But other than that, I've had good experiences.  If you can't find something on the menu that looks good to you, ask the waiter for something that you'd like to eat.  Sometimes they'll have it.",

As I sat there I told my sister this feels like Cheesecake Factory. I saw someone's to go box and I knew it was Cheesecake Factory. I got online and sure enough they are the same restaurant. We had a nice dinner. The food was good we took half of it home. If you do not like cheesecake factory you may not like this place. I do think it's better than cheesecake factory.",

Open 24/7, this place has something for everyone with Signature items for breakfast, brunch/lunch and dinner to tapas, espresso, dessert, cocktails and late night snacks.  Coffee = Amazing. Highly recommend! It definitely makes my Top 3 for best coffee I've ever had. I take my coffee black, but this coffee was so delicious and flavourful that my girlfriends did as well. Defs worth a try!  We strolled in around 5:20AM and shared the Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls (4 big rolls for $12) - a good healthier option of the late-night options.",

I had the Beef Wellington which consisted of 4 nice sized filet medallions with pastry tops, carrots, yummy Brussels sprouts, and whipped potatoes.  I don't normally prefer Brussels sprouts, but these were fantastic.  Our waitress was very good, and we were seating immediately.  It was around 7:30, so I assumed there would be a wait.   The food was reasonably priced in general.  Compared to other places we ate during the week, the prices were low and the food here was MUCH better than what I've had so far.  I'm hoping to make it back once more before we leave.  This is now going to be one of my \"must haves\" when visiting, and I will highly recommend it to friends traveling to Las Vegas.",

This Grand Lux probably gets more business than the one we have back home in the Beverly Center, but it is more or less the same.  The ambiance and service are pleasant and uninteresting, and the food is unmemorable.  I do take issue with there being no bathroom within the restaurant.  The space is huge, and I fail to see why you have to go into the casino to take a leak.  The good thing about Grand Lux is that the menu is varied to suit all tastes, including very young ones.  We split chicken and waffles, strawberry French toast, and pastrami hash and eggs.  Nothing stood out, and the waffles and French toast probably tended towards bad, but everything was edible.  Grand Lux is nowhere to go out of your way for, but if you're hungry and it falls in your path, there's nothing to avoid at all costs either.",

I was excited to try the place after seeing the raving reviews on yelp.   Unfortunately, I think I might have came at an off time. Service was unfortunately awful. I waited for my waiter for at least 20 minutes before he came by and asked if I wanted anything to drink. He was entertaining a big group sitting next to me. I asked if another waiter can take my order since I was hungry, but she insisted that I wait for my waiter.   My waiter finally came by and took my order. I ordered Polynesian Salad. It was delicious and large! I liked the flavors of the ingredients in the salad--mango, cucumber, grilled chicken with sprinkling of apricot-pineapple dressing.   After I finished my salad, I noticed that my waiter did not delivered my complimentary bread that I saw on every tables. I was disappointed to see and experience such bad service here because I really enjoyed the food here.   I would come back here for the food, but I really hope that they improved their service next time I am here.   Plus, they are opened 24 hours, perfect for those late night hungers!!",

Definitely started the trip off right with some surprisingly tasty cocktails - the Pineapple Smash was so awesomely summer, and the Shoot The Moon beer cocktail was really great as well.   For food, the waiter accidentally brought me the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, instead of the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich I ordered. BUT IT'S OKAY, because he apologized profusely and gave us a complimentary dessert at the end. The buffalo chicken sando itself was spicy and friend and huge and perfect, and I am certainly glad about his mistake. I also tried my friend's kobe burger and it was really, REALLY tasty. One note, though: don't come here when you're counting calories.  For (free!) dessert, the waiter brought out a Warm Butter Cake, which was, frankly, THE BEST. It tasted sort of like a waffle not in a waffley shape, and the ice cream and strawberries just really completed it.  Overall, definitely an choice place for some late night dining, if you can excuse having deja vu of your local Cheesecake Factory.",

    "text": "Put me in Grand Lux Cafe or a Cheesecake Factory location and slight decor differences aside, they are pretty much identical. Whether it's the atmosphere, the decor, the staff and the menu, these two are pretty much identical.   It's weird too, because as I entered the Venetian and was seeking for a place to eat that was affordable and quick (I had to head to the Blue Man Group show and only had one hour to eat), everyone told me that this Cheesecake Factory-like restaurant was around the corner. When they said that it was similar, I had no idea what I was in for and how much of a clone it really was. Stunning but neat.  So we proceeded to walk in and get seated and a very friendly waiter took care of us. We ordered some stiff drinks, 2 Scotchs, on the rocks. Then while my grandfather 'carbed up' with a clam pasta dish, I went for one of their big salads; in this case it was their Chopped salad - grilled chicken, bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, egg and mixed greens. The whole thing was tossed in a vinaigrette.   The food came out from the kitchen in under fifteen minutes. The clam pasta dish according to my grandfather was very tasty and the clams very fresh. The salad was large and despite my best attempts, I could not finish it. The dressing complimented the rest of the ingredients well and I didn't feel heavy from eating it. The service was great and the prices were great as well.  Overall this place is a nice addition to the Venetian. It provides reasonably good food at good prices and with good service. It's reliable and their menu is varied enough to satisfy all kinds of appetite. I didn't however find it to be as good as any Cheesecake Factory location I've been to. It's less tacky though which is a good thing.",

Lets try pieces with veggies and mashed potatoes.

I thought I was going to fall walking in and out of the restaurant! -the servers tend to disappear on you for long, and i mean LOOOOONG periods of time -they say they have a \"soup of the day\" then return after about 15 minutes of you ordering it to tell you they ran out of \"soup of the day\" at around 7pm.   -food takes a long time to come out, and the refills for your drinks take just as long... except when the manager comes to your table, the server shows up instantaneously to ask what's wrong and why the manager was at the table. -my friends that ordered the BLT sandwich and the mashed potatoes weren't thrilled with their meal... as they put it, \"it wasn't that great\"",

    "text": "I was recently in Vegas for four days and seemed to keep ending up here every night (or morning around 5am).  Since this is owned by the Cheesecake Factory, the decor and many choices and the menu had much the same flavor.  First visit (5AM)-Fried chicken and waffles. Second visit (5PM)-a huge Max Burger. Third visit (4AM)-corned beef hash and eggs.  The late night menu was very extensive and there's pretty much something to satisfy every craving.  The corned beef hash is real strips of corned beef, not that dog food can stuff you get at Safeway.  That meal was the least favorite of the three.  Fried chicken and waffles were good.  Burger was great.  Service was quick and filled water and drinks often.  The floor was really slippery like someone dropped a bottle of olive oil and the cleaner spread it around the entire joint.  At one point, a lady fell as she was exiting.  Note to restaurant:slippery floor+tons of drunk people at 5AM=accident and lawsuit waiting to happen.  We ran into Ron Jeremy in the waiting area-the legend of something.",

We walk all the way from the Venetian to Palazzo to eat at Grand Lux and find out that we have to go all the way back to Venetian since Palazzo's location was closed and the Venetian location is the one that is open late.   I ordered the Kobe Beef hot dog, and it was a great portion for an appetizer, though was a little too big. I almost would have prefered tapas sized portions for this one since it could hardly fit in my mouth, and it came with three hot dogs!  One of my friends however, ordered mac and cheese, and it was SO GOOD! SOOO GOOD! I definitely ordered it again when we ate for a second time at the Grand Lux Palazzo right before we left Vegas.   At 6 in the morning, this place was PACKED! It might have even been 5AM, but they had a list, and a wait to eat here. Crazy! I was really disappointed about the Kobe hot dogs so I had to knock off a star for that reason, and I really preferred the Palazzo location in general.",

I agree with the similarities to the Cheesecake Factory when it comes to how the courses are delivered, but food quality blows CF out of the water.  Aside from the calamari, we had the Rustic Lasagna, Chicken Royale and Shaking Beef - all delicious.   One thing to keep in mind is that the portions are huge. For those (like us) that don't have the appetite to match, it's appropriate here to split the entree and maybe have a couple appetizers.   If you do end up enjoying this place the way we did, it's definitely worth a trip or two back to sample the many choices on the menu.",

I ordered a breakfast plate for lunch with hasbrowns, egg & bacon. I didn't even finish the whole thing. Just your basic breakfast food.

    "text": "Don't go! Two of us went for dinner.  The first sign of trouble was so many different staff came by the table we were never quite sure who our waiter was.  Someone took the drink order; a different person took the food order.  Every single item was brought to the table by a different person.  You might think this would make it a very fast and efficient, but no.  I ordered the cream of chicken soup and a small chopped salad.  My partner ordered the smoked salmon platter.  We each had a drink.  When the food arrived the smoked salmon platter did not have a bagel as it should have.  I tried to flag down our waiter or any waiter and it was next to impossible.  Finally our(?) waiter arrived and we explained the problem.  Fifteen minutes later still no bagel and no sign of our waiter.  I got the attention of another waiter and explained the problem.  Ten minutes pass and no bagel and no waiter.  By now I'm getting agitated.  I manager comes over and I explain the problem of the missing bagel and missing waiter.  I also stated that I didn't think we should have to pay for the platter since we have now been there for over an hour.  He went to the kitchen to check.  The waiter then appeared and said the kitchen had no bagels but the manager was taking care of things. (No offer to reorder just more waiting).  Finally two hard as a rock bagels arrive.  As a \"courtesy\" the manager removed the charge for the $5.00 soup.(How generous)  We never saw him again.  The whole affair, from arriving at the table to check arrival takes nearly two hours! You bet I paid in cash so as not to have to wait for my credit card to come back.  I think the waiter tried his best.  The problem here seems to be TOTAL lack of management and total chaos in the kitchen.  It was 8:00pm and the place was half empty. The looked to be more than ample wait staff. Two hours for soup, salad and a lox platter???!!! This place is totally mismanaged. The food wasn't even up to the usual Grand Lux standards. Stay away.",

In fact, the Grand Lux makes fairly good food in spite of being attached to the Factory's name.  And it's more than affordable.  What isn't good is the breakfast. Stay away during breakfast hours!",

I must say that I was really disappointed with the limited food menu after reading that this place was good for late night cravings.   I give credit to the lady greeter who warned us at the door, that they were only serving pizzas, salads and soups at that time.  Still, we were tired and hungry after a late flight so we asked to be seated.   We ordered the Asian nachos, which I really didn't like because there was too much sweet & spicy peanut butter sauce....the whole thing was wayyy too sweet! I don't recommend.  The creamy chicken & mushroom soup was sooo good, we ordered a second round!!!  In my opinion, I think this place is hit or miss with their food. Of course, I didn't really have much to select from.  I think I'll give Grand Lux Cafe a second chance and try their dinner menu next time.",

Found this 24/7 cafe in the Venetian and said hell yeah. Waddled all the way there, got sat right away and didn't know what to order. It didn't help that their menu was so large, and we had only 5 minutes before we couldn't order off the diner menu. Our server was really friendly, and understood our time crunch so she came back to check on us immediately after getting our waters. Too bad we cracked under pressure and went for the late night menu, which had almost the same items.   My bf and I went back and forth between the chicken fettuccine or the chicken mushroom pasta. Finally, we flipped a coin and went for the fettuccine. Boy, we were not disappointed. The fettuccine was the perfect amount for two and it was not too creamy nor dry. We added cheese and crushed peppers to it as well. Sharing goes along way, so we decided to grab dessert too. We had the red velvet cake and it was so huge we couldn't even finish it. We were in heaven..... so much, I came back on our last night to eat here again!   This time we had the chicken mushroom pasta, which was alright. Not my cup of tea but still edible. We came during dinner time and got bread and butter. Then we decided skip dessert and do an appetizer this time. We got the Asian nachos, and it was so different and unique. Something we never tasted, and it was so big, I was full eating the pasta. Crispy fried wontons topped with melted cheese, grilled chickens, fried rice, green onions, and peanut and wasabi drizzled.   Service was on point both times, the waitresses always checked up on us, asked how we were doing, and never kept us waiting too long for our refills and the check!",

Breakfast buffet is always good with good endless bacon and coffee. Steaks and most sandwiches are quite good. Don't expect the best bartenders in here though. Go to the main bars in Venetian or Pallazzo for the discerning. All the drinks were too sweet for me.",

I was expecting similar quality as Cheesecake Factory (which is the parent company that owns this restaurant) but the culinary skill here is definitely several levels below. It is subpar. Worse than Denny's.   We ordered simple sandwiches but they were so bad. I didn't think it's possible to make a bad sandwich, all butter, fat and no flavor. The bread didn't taste fresh and worse than what you get at grocery stores. Worse than Safeway sandwiches. They were disgusting. I'm pretty sure they doctored these reviews in order to produce such a good rating.",

As many times as I've eaten here I've settled on two dishes for breakfast - the chicken and waffles and the biscuits and gravy.   Both traditional, but both the best I've ever had. While a little pricey - admittedly, there are far more expensive breakfasts on the strip.   As for the buffet option? Also fantastic. Many many choices with options you wouldn't normally find at a breakfast buffet. I can say that I'm never bored with the buffet, but I do recommend the dishes (and they're a little cheaper).   One note to add: they do charge for every fruit juice refill so pay attention to how many your having. I got slammed for 20 bucks in juices cause I assumed it was free - negative Ghostrider.",

What part of the description of this dish mentions anything about being spicy?    Pasta Telephono        A Rich Tomato Sauce with Melted Mozzarella Cheese Baked and topped with Toasted Bread Crumbs with Chicken  I am not talking about a little red pepper but a serious amount of it.  One bite and my mouth and throat were on fire.  I even like spicy food a lot.  Between the red sauce and the dim lighting I didn't see the pepper flakes.  My husband and I let the manager know and she said \"I'll take it off the bill\" and grabbed the plate. That is good because there is no way we would ever pay for it. She asked if I wanted to order anything else.  As hungry as I was, there was absolutely no way.  I write reviews on Yelp because I often rely on other's reviews to figure out where to eat when we visit other cities. Hopefully, reviews I give help others decide too.  If there is one review of mine that I hope people read it would be this one.   I have no idea how this happened at a restaurant in The Venetian, which I consider one of the nicest luxury resorts in Las Vegas.  What is the skill level of the people cooking at this restaurant?",

The eggs benedict was just ok, I think the Hollandaise sauce was a little too sour and the hash browns was too greasy.   The restaurant it self is nice and big, but super loud.  They have huge booths down the middle that can seat 6-8 people comfortably so it's perfect for groups.  They were super busy so even though the food was good and our server was nice, service was not up to par.  I had to ask for for refills on my coffee and water which was not a good thing.

    "text": "World class restaurants and Chefs galore in Las Vegas and yet here I was at The Venetian's version of The Cheesecake Factory. woof.  Not my president.  Not my restaurant pick.   I came here because I was on a holiday trip with my mom and grandma and their taste in food... well, not mine. My mom wants burgers, and pasta, and very normal lower middle class American food. My grandma wants yogurt. Love them but going out to eat and trying new foods and dishes are my favorite thing on the planet and their dietary desires made me getting what I wanted not possible.   Grand Lux Cafe is perfectly fine if you love meat. The menu, like Cheesecake Factory, is a zillion pages long, most things are chicken based but they have burgers, pasta, salads (most served with meat), and large dessert selection. The portions, again like Cheesecake Factory, are huge and shareable and all things considered, it's an affordable meal with really basic offerings.   I was shocked that on a menu this large there were so few vegetarian options. That was so crazy to me. And I'm sure you can maybe modify some of the dishes to be sans chicken (the ingredient du jour in most things here), I'm not a fan of paying the premium for meat that I'm not getting.   Service here, was actually very good. We wanted for nothing, they were on it with the refills and extra accoutrements for my grandma's hot tea. They didn't keep us waiting, they checked on us at appropriate intervals, it was overall very pleasant.   My mom got some sort of massive burger and my grandma and I split a veggie burger (not your standard morning star crap, but actually a decent patty with the main base being farro) and a salad. The portions were huge on both. We probably could have just ordered one thing and split it considering they complimentary bread and butter they give you. I did not partake in the bread but my family seemed to enjoy it.   The veggie burger was hearty, the fries that came with it were good. The salad had waaay too much dressing for a person who doesn't want to die of a heart attack. It could have been decent but the dressing amount just swamped it. The cheese on it was like the most basic pre-cut grocery store party platter bright orange and True white cheese. Not exactly artisan but it certainly helped to offset the acidic overpowering taste of the dressing.   I'd also gotten a bowl of their minestrone, that was really good, but worth noting that I love salt and it was extremely sodium-rich and not for the faint of heart.  Overall, it's not the worst place you can go. In fact, it's perfectly fine and they're actually open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which is a great quality for a restaurant in Vegas. Is it on my top 20 to-do list for Vegas? No. Is it on my Plan-B list for next time in case I can't get in anywhere else or happen to be with people with basic taste? Yes.",

It is a little loud with the casino right behind you but bearable. My favorite entree is the spaghettini with clams and shrimp. Grand Lux is always on the list of restaurants we want to hit when in Vegas.",

Price is reasonable, but not dirt cheap if that is what you are looking for.  The ribs were tender and fell off the bone.  But it's like a cheesecake factory, all is good, it'll be difficult to order something that doesn't taste good and not too expensive.  Certainly not ans dining experience restricted to vegas but I'm here on business.",

WOW!  I ordered the crispy thai springrolls...they were SO GOOD...the service was excellent along with the superb food..out entrees were brought out of the kitchen by two different wait staff at the same time...and the prices are fair.  We were quite impressed...even looking at what people next to us had ordered and wishing we could try that too...no room for dessert...its a good thing we didnt order dessert...we saw 2 dessert plates being delivered to a table nearby and they were huge and looked to be sinfully delicious.  This place was so good I will make a special trip back to the Venitian just to eat there again..A+++ Grand Lux Cafe",

    "text": "Came here for lunch and while I've been to this place a few times, I finally found something great to look forward to and will come back here every time I hit L.V. We started with the Stacked chicken quesadilla. It was crispy and savory and stuffed with whole black beans, green chiles, tomatoes, tender moist chicken, melted cheese and sprinkled with kernels of sweet yellow corn *sigh*... really it was that good. I went with a lunch special. Had the pasta carbonara and a small house salad. The salad was, well salad. The dressing was tasty and the greens were crisp. The pasta was wholesome, rich and loaded with smoked bacon, peas, mixed with creamy blends of cheese. it was very fulfilling. After eating a slice of bread or two and a wedge of quesadilla I could only eat about half my pasta before I was full. Baby had the Burger Melt. It sat on some sort of garlic parmesan bread, had lots of cheese and grilled onions, I had a bite. It was very big and intimidating, great if you like meat. The fries were crispy and and not overly salted. They told us about their fresh baked desserts which we didn't have the pleasure of trying. Now as to the best, yes I'm saving it for last. The Grand Lux Peach Bellini *moan moan moan* OMG, seriously orgasm in my mouth. I could taste the bubbly but it didn't overpower, had a slushy like consistency, a nice big amount of peaches and a big ripe red strawberry to top it all off. I could've drank ten. Best ten dollars I've spent in my life. So fruity and refreshing and just a burst of joy for my taste buds, I'm going back for a few more as soon as I can. The food was good it deserve a three and a half but I'm giving them a five for the Bellini itself. Peach Bellini for breakfast? Yes please!",

    "text": "Never have I eaten at Grand Lux Cafe so many times in one weekend, but there's a reason why and it's because it's so good and convenient. We stayed at the Venetian hotel and this was the only place that was open 24/7 with great late night eats. The food court got tiring after so many visits. The menu is here is so extensive that you can try something new every time. We came in for lunch one day and many of us ordered their lunch special, such a great deal. For $10 bucks you can get a cup of soup, side salad, and half a sandwich. All my friends said they enjoyed what they ordered. I opted to pay $2 more for the side salad and half pasta combo. Even half of a regular pasta entree was a lot for me to eat for lunch and I even had to take it to go. The Cabonara pasta is so tasty! Loaded with cream sauce, which I love, I hate dry pastas, it got a boost of flavor from the bits of bacon and green peas. Because it is Vegas, top off your meal with a cocktail! The Blood Orange Mojito is an excellent choice! The fries there are to die for. It seems so simple and so common a thing, but the fires there keep me coming back. Maybe there's a special oil that they cook them in because they have a richer and sweeter after taste. They're just ordinary fries, but dip it in a bit of ranch or ketchup and you'll be chomping away the whole plate of fries before you know it! Service here also never fails, always friendly and quick, despite it being super crowded all the time. I came back so many times the manager even remembered me. He called me \"Sloppy Joe Girl\" because one night I ordered it and he was happy I came back for more food. He even kept going back to the kitchen to check up on our take out order so we wouldn't be waiting so long. This makes up for the crappy cashier. He did however apologize to us and said that he was just having a bad day, but still, don't take it out on your customers, that's very unprofessional. One night we ordered a sloppy joe and the other night we ordered the chicken cream pasta with sun dried tomatoes for take out. The sloppy joe was nice and tangy with a sprinkle of chopped onions, so good! The meat was loaded with flavor, probably too salty alone, but when paired up with the long sandwich buns, it was a perfect balance. It also came with a side sauce of some orange tangy nature which I didn't care too much for. The chicken pasta was good, but probably not my favorite dish there so far. It didn't have as much cream sauce compared to the Cabonara that I liked and the grilled chicken was dry. It was a little hard to eat. It was a huge portion though, it fed like three of us girls! Till next time Grand Lux, I will be back for you!",

The wait staff and hosts couldn't have been friendlier, and though it was a busy night, we didn't feel rushed or have to wait long for a table. Unlike many restaurants on the strip that had a price fix menu, the Grand Lux Cafe stayed with it's original menu and made our new years eve dinner memorable, affordable and delicious. I would definitely recommend it. Gave it 4 out 5 stars, only because it's a chain restaurant.",

The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce exceeded my expectations so far beyond any hollandaise I've had in the past. Honestly I don't know that I will be able to get another eggs Benedict to measure up to this one. Even the English muffin was better than any other I've had. My cafe mocha was like drinking dessert for breakfast.   My husband's pastrami hash was so much food it was almost ridiculous. The hash had tons of nice size chunks of pastrami throughout it. He would've preferred his scrambled eggs be cooked a hair longer, but he likes his eggs cooked to death, and should have mentioned that when ordering. There was so much food on his plate he just chose to eat around the eggs. The hash browns with both of our meals were cooked to golden perfection.   Service was excellent. Our server was attentive and it was impressive to see the hussle in ever worker in the place. The bussers were turning tables faster than anything I've ever seen.

The waiter wasn't very informative as to what was vegan, though he tried to make some suggestions.  After scouring the menu, I found something that looked like it would work.  I am so appreciative of the restaurants that go out of their way to make it easier for people that are vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, nut allergies, etc... Vegas being a destination spot for people from all around the world, I think most of the restaurants are being progressive in offering alternative menus.  I hope that Grand Lux Cafe hops on board! I ended up ordering the Pasta Fresca.  According to the menu it was cooked in olive oil with  eggplant, asparagus, mushrooms and  peppers.  Great flavor!",

    "text": "I came to the Grand Lux Cafe with 3 co-workers for lunch during HIMSS at the Sands Expo Convention Center. It's a short walk away from all of the conference chaos and we were seated immediately. I began with an icy peach Bellini, which was champagne and peach liquor blended together smoothie-style. It was tasty - not too strong. I'm used to being able to get in and out of most restaurants in Indy in 45-60 minutes and grew impatient at times with the slow service in Vegas, which routinely took 75-90 minutes no matter where you went. If you're anywhere on the strip, every restaurant worth eating at is packed, so plan in advance for it. Make reservations when you can. I ordered the pasta carbonara, which included bacon, peas, and garlic in a parmesan sauce for a reasonable $15.95 - the cheapest lunch I had all week. You could add chicken for $4 more, but I knew I was going to Fogo de Chao in a few hours for dinner so I declined that option. You could also get this dish gluten-free. It included a small salad and bread appetizer. The dish was excellent - one of two surprisingly authentic and delicious Italian dishes (minus the pancetta) I had during my stay in Vegas. The menu has a lot of options so everyone should be able to find something to suit their tastes. I don't recall the waitress's name, but she was helpful and attentive. Of all the places we ate at the conference center, this was the best quality and service for the price.",

They are definitely a must when visiting, just make sure you get there before 11 AM. The breakfast is not 24 hours.   7/25/2017 We are back at Grand Lux for another delicious breakfast! As usual my husband ordered the pancakes and I ordered the eggs Benedict. My breakfast was taking a little longer then expected to cook, so our wonderful server Amanda brought us some complimentary strawberries.

    "text": "For years, the Grand Lux was the best 24 hour coffee shop in Vegas in my opinion.  I don't know if that's True now, places like Central at Caesars are certainly giving it a run for its money, as casinos are investing more thought and money into these 24 hour joints.  But, Grand Lux is certainly an excellent place to eat any time of day, and you'd be hard pressed to find better food in the middle of the night.  The menu is expansive, which is not surprising given that it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory folks.  Most sandwiches are a good bet in my experience; the club is a favorite of more than one visitor I've taken to Grand Lux.  The fries are good, but they are rarely seasoned.  The buffalo chicken spring rolls are a favorite of mine, whenever we get appetizers they get my vote.  They are made like traditional spring rolls, but with the buffalo and blue cheese flavor wing fans will like.  The Grand Lux Burger Melt is another menu item I've ordered more than once.  Served on grilled parmesan bread, it's a play on a patty melt.  Certainly not appropriate if you're looking for a light meal, but it's a great burger.  More than once, I've had the breakfast buffet in the morning.  It's very simple:  pastries, fruits, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, etc.  But, it's all fresh and hot, and they make omelets or hash browns to order.  I prefer my hash browns extra crispy, so they made some and brought it to the table.  Since Venetian doesn't have a buffet, this is a nice option in the morning.  Finally, I love the strawberry lemonade, but it's too sweet.  I get it without the sugar lining the rim, and that does the trick for me.  Service can be spotty during peak hours, but I've never had any major issues.",

I also ordered chocolate martini. It was nice as expected. No one ever fail in making chocolate martini so far :)  Service: awesome! I don't know how the waiter can be so nice and cheerful even after midnight!  Price: value for money because of its huge portion.  Tips: Get a table outside near the fence.

I love that they aren't skimpy with their seafood and I love the light sauce and the flavor profiles. The salad features: shrimp, lump crab, avocado, tomato, corn, green beans, egg, celery, romaine, and egg with Louis dressing. The portion is made to share with people as it is huge. You simply must try it even if you're not a fan of salads. It's hefty but light at the same time. It's my favorite salad. We also got the Asian nachos to start. They were pretty satisfying, however the sauce is a little too sweet and overpowers the dish. The salad was the definite star of the show. To accompany our dishes, we got some cocktails. I got the strawberry martini, and my friend got the Tahitian pineapple. Both were made very well and were well balanced. Till next time Grand Lux!",

    "text": "This review is from 04/22/2015.  My wife and I were in town for a wedding anniversary trip and we were staying at the Venetian.  We'd been pretty disappointed with most of the restaurants in the Venetian at this point in our trip, but it was early and we wanted to grab some breakfast.  Our server (Aimee) pointed out that the breakfast buffet would be less than the meals we were considering since I was ordering orange juice, and the juice was included in the buffet.   I'm glad she recommended it, because it was a pretty decent breakfast buffet.  I think it was only about $10-12 and we were both very satisfied with the breakfast.  Lots of fruit, waffles, sausage, bacon -- pretty standard breakfast buffet fare, along with an omelet station.  Fresh squeezed orange juice (about $5 a glass) was included with free refills.  That alone was worth it.  We will not be staying at Venetian again for many reasons, but this was one of the few restaurant successes we saw there.",

I've been here twice mostly due to the food variety, but as far as food quality goes, it's decently good with generous portions. I think of this as a jack of all trades, master of none type of establishment. If you're looking for a specific type of cuisine, there are easily better locations. But if you're looking for relatively affordable food (by Vegas strip standards) then you really can't go wrong with the Grand Lux.   I've had both the chicken and waffles and the Zen Noodles and the chicken and waffles are considerably better. The Zen Noodles which is like Pho was generally disappointing.",

    "text": "\"Relaxed, Comforting Opulence\"  The Grand Lux cafe mixes a blend of modernized old world opulence in their atmosphere and decor with comforting casualness of more American dining. The menu is extensive, their dessert display cases tantalizing, and kudos for having many gluten-free dishes available and clearly marked on the menu.  I have previously visited their other location in Boca Baton, FL and with this branch being in the Venetian hotel and the distractions of Vegas, there was no waiting and were seated immediately (yay!)   I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh lemonade with sugar rimmed glass (better than their strawberry or raspberry lemonade I have tried in the past.) Thanks to our server Jason for the to-go cup idea for the lemonade that I sipped and enjoyed later during my play time with the slot machines.  The gltuen-free Bistro steak with the roasted, perfectly seasoned brussel sprout shavings and buttery textured mashed potatoes were excellent and the portion size just right.  Kudos to the service and staff at this location. No dessert this time but in the past you cannot go wrong with any of their choices.",

First night: Mandarin Cosmopolitan and Spicy Calamari Salad.  The salad sounded like a good option because it just tied together some interesting flavors. The vinaigrette seemed to be missing, but the spicy sauce had a kick. Mandarin Cosmo was made with an excess of sweet and sour. I have a feeling they missed the Mandarin part. If you pay $12 for a martini, it should be semi-decent. Because for $2 more in Vegas, you can pay a bartender who knows to make your drink...  Service was not bad - our waiter had a lot of pep to his step. Red bull gives you wings, definitely.  Second night: Buffalo Chicken Rolls  For those familiar to Cheesecake, this is the Buffalo Blast's step-sister. Nothing great to note about the dish. Service was lackluster.  Overall, okay - but nothing too impressive to note.",

THE TASTE IS JUST WONDERFUL! Cooked through, or not, I would still say the flavors that pull through it are amazing. Too bad they don't have any other sides besides fries you can get with it.  I have also tried a few of their Asian-inspired dishes and have not been disappointed yet!   It's on the strip (boo!), but still worth going to if you're in the area.

This is a great place to go for delicious affordable food and nice atmosphere at any time of the day. -- They're open 24/7!   The burgers are absolutely delicious and are HUGE! I always cut them in half and end up eating the second half later on. They also have yummy pasta dishes and soup and sandwich combos. My favorite thing that i ordered was the spicy crispy chicken burger; just the right amount of spice with all the right toppings and served with their tasty french fries!

My fiancee and I decided to grab a quick lunch before our drive back home and settled on the Grand Lux. We were promptly seated and our server came with the menu. Given that we were hungry, we ordered an appetizer right away (fried calamari). Afterwards, it took our server (main server) quite some time to get back to us and get our main orders. We order the sunday pasta and the sausage pizza, thinking that whatever was left over we could just eat on the way as well. Let's start with the app. As soon as my calamari came, I noticed there were no lemons. I asked for the server who dropped off the food (server #1) if I could have some lemons. She said yes and went to get them. We never saw her again. Then, we asked a different server for water since our own server was nowhere to be found and thinking that server#1 would be coming back with lemon. We never saw server #2 (and #1). Given the lack of servers available, we then had to ask the host to please locate our server and explained to her that we had asked for water and lemons. The host explained that their calamari does not normally come with lemons but they would bring us lemons. Finally I got my lemons. The pasta and pizza also took some time to come, and I must say... they felt pretty greasy (even to two hungry people). Then we finally saw our main server, but by that point we explained that we were in a rush so we just asked for a to-go box for the rest and the check at the same time. We got the boxes first and we were waiting for the check to come. Overall, I have experienced better in terms of food and service. Prices were reasonable.",

We were not aware the we'd be charged like $5 bucks each for wine glass full of grapefruit juice and orange juice. I'll wave that off since we know prices get hefty in Vegas.   I got the  Best Eggs Benedict with Ham & Hollandaise. The egg was cooked perfectly and the sourdough on the bottom was toasted well too but I guess i just didn't like the Hollandaise sauce. It was a bit too rich for me. Scraping it all to the side, the dish was made a bit more edible. Perhaps the style of egg preparation is just not for me.   We also got the Red Velvet Pancakes. Those were better tasting when smothered with the cream cheese frosting otherwise they were a bit dry. I probably shouldn't have mixed the sweet and savory together as stomach felt queasy afterwards.   I probably wouldn't come here again for breakfast but perhaps give it another shot for lunch or dinner.    I give it 3 stars still for I like the decor of the cafe and the service was nice still :).",

    "text": "I've had a couple of meals at the Grand Lux Cafe (on both the Venetian side and the Palazzo side) and have been VERY impressed with how quickly they move the patrons in and out of the restaurant so you are not waiting in line very long ... but you never feel rushed while you are eating.  In my last experience, my waiter went above and beyond. Since I choose to eat gluten-free, I ordered an egg-white omelet and asked if I could substitute the toast for fresh fruit. He said I could substitute the fruit for hash browns, but not for the toast. So I passed on the toast, but did order the hash browns. It took longer than I expected for eggs (it was about 30 minutes) and he came back to my table just before my food came out and said \"I'm so sorry for the delay in your food, but I wanted to talk to the chef before putting in your order to make sure the hash browns were ok for you ... just to make sure we didn't put bread or anything in them, because I know they're not just plain potatoes.\"  I was SO impressed that he made that effort!  While I was waiting for my food, I was watching the efficient wait staff bus and reset tables. As the man was resetting the table next to me for the next guest, he was putting out the side/bread plates and I noticed a piece of paper on one of the plates (like a receipt or washing instructions from a new box of china). I wondered if he would notice and as soon as he finished - he took one last look at the table, saw the paper, looked at it as if to say \"what is that?\" and not only removed the paper but also replaced the plate with a clean plate.  What attention to detail! I have been VERY impressed with Grand Lux in every dining experience. Kudos!",

    "text": "Just reviewed the Cheesecake Factory so it seemed only natural to also review the Grand Lux Cafe' while I'm at it tonight. Went to the one in Houston several times and fell in love with it (except the high-ceilinged bus station design and corresponding noise level), so was glad to find they opened one in the Venetian...and then opened one in Palazzo next door soon after. Kind of weird to have the only two GLC's in Vegas so close to one another, but they don't seem to suffer for customers, so that's a good sign. I'm reviewing the Venetian one because we've been there more, but both locations are equally good.  I agree with the majority of the reviewers here- the menu is huge and caters to every taste (even vegetarians - and vegans - three items, I think), the portions are large and the specialty drinks are quite good. My favorite items are the chicken piccata, wiener schnitzel and Thai chicken pizza...even when here for brunch, actually. A couple of items are similar to the Cheesecake Factory (southwestern salad, Asian chicken salad, jambalaya, chicken parmesan) but are presented in a more upscale manner and larger portion size. What is definitely different from the Cheesecake Factory is the dessert tray- the beignets, peach cobbler, bread pudding, various decadent chocolate delights and fruit tarts are definitely tempting, but five types of cheesecake are also served here for \"traditionalists...\"  As a Vegas local, I'm always on alert on the Strip for the all-too-common management vibe that says \"We cater to tourists- and can cut corners because we know most won't be back no matter how good the service is.\" We come back here so often (both locations, but primarily the Venetian) because never has waitstaff ever seemed like they were anything but glad to serve. Sometimes there can be a backlog of orders and/or customers and things get delayed, but our server has always come over to apologize, give updates and the occasional extra bread basket, etc.   Four stars rather than five because the prices for some items are indeed higher than other comparable restaurants on and off the Strip, and the wait can sometimes be 30-40 minutes...sometimes at times you'd expect (weekend evenings and Fridays) and other times you might not (a Tuesday evening in December, a Monday morning in July...) But if the wait at this location is too long any given day, it's a 10-minute walk to the other one in the Palazzo where the wait might be shorter...and vice versa.",

We ordered chicken tenders (only on the kid's menu so if you want them, just ask!), the jambalaya (I forgot the specifics, oops), and the garlic shrimp pasta. Everything was delicious and the service was great. If you're looking for a real meal after clubbing or just in the middle of the day, I suggest checking out Grand Lux Cafe. Their menu is extensive and everything is delicious!",

The menu is almost exactly the same as what you can find at any Cheesecake Factory, only slightly more expensive and diverse. For the price, I'd recommend spending a little more and dining at a better restaurant.   However, if you're DRUNK and just walking out of TAO nightclub, this is the place to grab a sobering meal while you wait for the taxi lines to shrink! They have a late-night menu that consists of dinner, as well as breakfast options.   LATE NIGHT ONLY (1am-?):  -- Open 24 hrs, I think. If not, they're only closed at the butt-crack of dawn ;)  -- Late night menu (dinner and breakfast)  -- Short wait. I usually dine in parties of 6 or more and we've never waited longer than 10-15 minutes.  -- Drunk and don't want to wait in the long taxi line or gamble?! Sober up here!  -- This is your last chance to get at some girls/guys. You're in Vegas, make it happen! LOL",

So two people in my party order appetizers and a drinks. The waitress is very friendly. The appetizers finally come out along with the drinks, okay fine. After we got the appetizers and finished them, the waitress never comes back to take our entree orders. Matter of fact she never came back to even see if everything was okay. We waited about twenty minutes until we flagged down another waitress and we just asked for the check. We express our disappointment with the service, we paid the bill and left. This was my first time at the Grand Lux ever, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory plenty of times. The service sucked it at least out waitress did!!  This is Las Vegas, there service should be impeccable no matter where you are!! This location needs to step it up, your guys thrive on tourists! When I go back to Vegas, I will definitely avoid this establishment!!",

Another major plus about Grand Lux is that they're open 24 hours. Probably the best classy food you can get at 3 in the morning. Nice ambiance and pretty decent service overall. The best way to describe the food is traditional with a modern twist. Asian nachos- love the combination of crispy won tons and all the awesome toppings that come with it like chicken and wasabi cream. I tried the banana pudding and it was amazing as well. The banana pudding wasn't too sweet and it also came with chocolat dipped bananas sprinkled with peanuts. The vanilla wafers that came with it tasted home made, which I loved! I heard the caramel chicken is tasty. I will have to order that next time I'm there. The Beignets is probably my favorite dessert but they do not offer it at this location and only at the Palazzo one.",

Some people have mentioned a large line and little wait time, we found both the line and wait time nonexistent. The lady who escorted us to our seat was pleasant, asking me how my day was doing. I found the personalized attention refreshing. Once seated, our server could not have been better. She gave us the perfect amount of time to go through the menu before we were ready to order, and continually checked up on us and refilled our drinks without us asking. Our food came out in a timely fashion, and all was cooked to perfection- fish and burgers alike. As for dessert, we ordered a cheesecake, a cupcake creation, and a slice of key lime pie. The key lime pie was flavored perfectly-not too much and not too bland. The cheesecake was rich but tasty, and the cupcake dish was devoured in minutes.  All in all, an affordable and delicious choice for dinner. You can easily dress up or come casual- matters not. The lighting could be romantic if you wanted, or comfortable with friends. I plan to make this a traditional stop when I am here in Vegas and strolling the Venetian.",

Now he thing that gets this place to my 5 star list is with all those aforementioned the food is good. Not spectacular what would typically take it off my 5 star list, but the fact that your menu is that extensive and you still produce a quality product that can be very good at times will always get you 5 stars. Open 24/7 and as big as a small casino there will always be room. Be prepared to have a long sit time from the waiting service I think they get lost sometimes because this place is huge and they have to cover alot of tables. But most of the time you get very good service.  Where do we eat today??? 3 hours later your finishing your meal here.

I was craving cheese fries, so even though it wasn't on their menu, I had it made for me.  It was okay.  The cheese was melted over the fries, but was kind of burned.    My friends ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls (I was actually impressed by the sauce), the Chicken and Waffles (totally disappointed - my friend said it tasted like eating air because there was just no flavor), and the wings (somewhat tasty, but not all that great).    I'd go back again just due to pure convenience, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

Owned by the same people!  I ate here in January 2010 & went back on August 2010. We went here on Thursday night and Friday morning too!  Everything that I've tried there is so good.  We love the crispy chicken flautas, you will find them under the things to share category, those flautas are HUGE! I'm thinking like 9 inches long. You get four of those per order so with 1 -2 you are done! So don't be stingy and share!  I also got to tried some pasta, I forget what it was called, but it was delicious!  They have great burgers also! I used to be grossed out about medium rare meat, but I was wrong! That's the best, it brings out the flavor and juices of the meat.  We also ordered the half chicken salad sandwich, salad and soup- -The Salad was delicious -Asparagus soup was the best, I've ever tried -The sandwich, good but I wouldn't order it again.   Highly Recommended :)   Will I go back here? HELL YEAH!",

    "text": "Grand Lux Cafe is the only thing wrong happening at the Palazzo/Venetian. If I wanted to eat at this kind of place I would be hanging out at a Lakewood strip mall, debating Chili's or TGIF's. The menu is huge and they can do that because just like Chili's, or Friday's or any of your other dime a dozen national franchise restaurants nothing is really that fresh except for maybe the salads. All the sauces and seasonings came out of a bottle shipped from their main plant in Kentucky or somewhere else absolutely no wear near the kitchen that prepped your meal.   As if that kind generic nastiness isn't shameful enough on the strip, myself and several friends, on completely separate occasions have gotten sick after eating here. So many Vegas trips, so many hangovers, and nothing has ever compared to waking up the morning after a late night meal at Grand Lux. I've only had to drive home from Vegas one time, I'm always the passenger, like an older Asian woman, nobody trusts me to drive, except the morning after the night my bf/driver ate a Grand Lux sandwich. Luckily for me, I tasted the chemical yuck and only took a few bites causing low grade discomfort. He unfortunately is a guy and as such will eat almost anything served between two slices of bread. He suffered the consequences, he wasn't right for a good three days. I went to town eating all kinds of good stuff while he sat there watching regretting each and every bite of that rancid sandwich.   If you think I'm just hating on Grand Lux I dare you to just buy a sandwich and take it back to your room and eat it. As soon as that Styrofoam container hits your room, everything clean and hotel nice smelling about your room will dissipate; instead it will smell like somebodies armpit. Dare to leave that thing in your room over night and it will evolve into armpit mixed with gym sock. AWFUL!",

A few minutes later, the chef came out with a new steak and apologized. He gave me a plate of mashed potato and suggested I try it. The steak was sweet and flavorful with their marinated sauce, the mash was magnificent. The order was so good I came back a second night and had the exact same order.   I was just here again today and was in the mood for some pasta. I couldn't decide between the spaghetti with clams or the pasta with jumbo shrimps. My waiter said it was a tough choice but did end up recommended the jumbo shrimps with the marinara sauce. And again, great service and recommendation. The pasta was phenomenal.. m... m.....",

My cousin, sister and I went there for breakfast during a recent weekend trip to Vegas. The wait was so long and we were absolutely starving by the time we got our food. It was a good 45-50 minutes after we ordered. They didn't seem to have many servers working but you would think noon on a Saturday they should be pretty well staffed.   As for the quality of the food, it was very tasty. I had scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast. The hash browns were cooked perfectly. My sister and cousin also ordered similar breakfasts and were happy with theirs as well.   The service was only ok. The first server was kind of uninterested and never came back to let us know how much longer for our meals. Then there was a shift change and the second server came over and refilled our drinks and kept checking on the wait for our food. We were much more satisfied with him.   The menu is a little confusing, it is kind of long. And there's a section that says they only serve breakfast in the morning, but in the other sections it shows a different breakfast menu under lunch and late night which could be organized in a less confusing way.  All in all the meal was cooked well and we left happy and full.",

I have also never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I went to the Grand Lux twice during my stay at the Venetian.  The first time was for the breakfast where I got the breakfast buffet option.  The orange juice was really good and it tasted like it was freshly squeezed.  The fruit offered at the buffet line also tasted fresh and there were a decent selection.  The other buffet offering were pretty standard.  They offered hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon that was way too oily.  There was also an omelet station, but I did not get to have one made because the line was too long and I was hungry!  They also had an assortment of pastries, but I would have rather seen pancakes and waffles instead.  I was also disappointed to see that they did not have cottage cheese, which I thought was a breakfast buffet staple.  Everything cost $20 including tax and tip, but for that amount of money I would like to see more buffet options.  The second time I went was for late night dining.  I started with the broccoli cheddar soup which was RUNNY and BLAND and did not come with crackers or bread until I requested it.  I got the chicken and waffles as my main dish.  The waffle itself was pretty good.  It had good crunchy texture and buttery taste.  The chicken was also decent, but I should point out that these were chicken tenders and not fried chicken with the bone.  It was served with a pecan maple syrup.  I've never had authentic chicken and waffles, but I have a feeling that the original would have been a lot better than GLC\"s upscale version.",

    "text": "Stayed at Venetian for Labor Day weekend and for 2 nights, we had dinner here.  The portions are huge and the prices are fair, if not bordering on affordable.  A big juicy burger (chop house or mushroom) weighs in at about 1/3 lb with a huge serving of fries on the side for only about $13!!!!  The grilled chicken avocado salad is fresh and delicious, the portion serves 2 people (one if you're ravenous and will fill you to the brim!) for $14.  The Manhattan salad with the option of vegetables and cheese (other options include, chicken, shrimp, and price varies accordingly) rang in about $14.  They don't skimp on the cheese or beans or dressing either!  I eat a lot and the salads were filling!  Complimentary sourdough and butter came with the salads.  I think I got about 3 to 4 large slices of sourdough per salad.  How generous is that for a $14 meal?  Dinner for 2 cost under $35!  Much cheaper and fresher than other expensive places in Vegas.  After spending lots of money at a mediocre buffet (Bacchanal to be exact) with below par quality, this place was a delight!  Fresh quality with large portions at affordable prices is like a dream!  Presentation is worthy of any fine dining (maybe I exaggerate here, haha).  This place is open 24 hours too!",

This is a great place to go when you are too lazy to go to a fancy Vegas joint... or it's too late to go anywhere else like when you are on a winning streak and then realize it's already 430am and you haven't eaten all night.  My favorite has always been their build your own omelettes where you pick either egg whites or whole eggs and choose 4 ingredients such as ham, sausage, bacon, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc.  The list is quite extensive and I just can't remember it all right now.  They start you off with a huge basket of hot sourdough... I made the mistake of eating the bread and got myself all full before my food got here.  As usual, I went with the omelette, and I asked for my hash browns to be super fried and crispy.  They did not mess around... the hash browns came out in 1 piece because it was fried super crispy.  Imagine a thin layer of crunchy potatoes... sort of like a waffle cone but straight.  Anyway, this place never disappoints as long as you understand it for what it is.",

Price point is really reasonable, around $15 a plate depending on what you get. The service and ambiance is warm and cozy. It's not a super fancy upscale date, break the bank kind of place. Great for families and large group of friends to kick back and enjoy a good meal.

I get it delivered to the poker room at the venetian so I dont have a problem with them adding it, infact i usually tip at least 20%.  I only got 1 meal delivered, and when restaurants usually add it, its for like a party of 5 or more.  Ive eaten here quite a few times and never closely looked at the bill til now, when i noticed it.  The wait staff is shady because they dont mention it in hopes that i dont see it and i tip them twice, which is what ive been doing.  So ive been tipping at least 40% each time.  I wonder if the managers know this is how they operate?  People in here throw poker chips around like its nothing, so they dont think twice about it, and usually just pay the bill and assume its right.  Not the way a popular chain like this should do business",

My only complaint is the service.  The server felt fake too me when she kept saying this and that is so good.  Cmon lady, why would we ask for your opinion if you are going to give us some generic answer.  They have some Asian fares on the menu but I would stay away if you want authentic food.  Just go to Chinatown on Spring Mt Rd.",

It is the best patty melt I have every had.  It's a little greasey but hey it's a patty melt.  The bread is a pan grilled garlic bread crusted with cheese...mmm and them smothered with thousand island dressing.  The molten lave cake is relly good too.  It's a great place to stop in for a quick lunch. How can this be the same company as cheesecake factory which in my opinion is soooo bad.  only 4 stars because the last server we had was just not cutting it",

The chicken pot pie was flavorful.  The Polynesian salad was savory, and the spaghetti dish had a nice tomato sauce.  I am really giving it 3 1/2 stars, but it is not quite at the \"fan\" level for me.  So, if you're tired of the buffet gorging, this would be a nice alternative.",

This is not your average Denny's no sir. We were a pretty large party of 11 plus 1 giant banana named Ben. *see pic* It being so late or early depending on how you look at it I guess. It is Vegas after all but that's not the point here. We had to wait awhile before being seated where there were maybe 3 other occupied tables in our section so I wouldnt say it was busy by any means. Our waitress her name escapes me. Sorry, late night!! But she was AWESOME!! Seriously 11 drunktards and she was hekka cheery chatting mith us, taking orders, making suggestions, playing with Ben ,etc. I cant remembered what everyone ordered but I don't think anyone was too impressed with the food, nothing stood out and a few people had to change their orders for they ran out of some things. I on the other hand always order my good ole Vegas stand by bagel & lox, well you cant really mess that up too much now can you?? So in summation basically if there is nothing else open, you dont feel like walking, and the elevator to your suite is right next to this place I would definitely go again!",

Now, I came here with a few buddies of mine on our last Vegas trip and the food and service is what you'll expect at any Cheesecake Factory chain. The food here was OK, and portions were huge, even for the lunch menu. I wasn't able to finish my pasta dish, and those that know me know I don't have a small appetite. My friends ordered their pizza, salad, and other pasta choices off their lunch menu (Had about 10 or so to choose from) and we were content with our lunch.   Honestly people, the food here is really just OK, and I'm puzzled with the 5 star ratings some people have left. I mean, it IS just Cheesecake Factory inside the Venetian that's renamed Grand Lux Cafe. If this was located in Los Angeles or San Francisco, this is nothing more than a chain restaurant to me.  I'm giving this place 4 stars for being open 24 hours, which is a big plus in my books and the prices are very fair being in Las Vegas. The food here is just what you'll expect before going in. Large portions, fair prices, but nothing to write home about. Will I come back? Of course, but seriously, there are better food out there. Come here for grubbin' food at any hour without putting a dent in your wallet while on the strip.",

But this last time I went to Grand Lux was by far the most memorable because:  1) a group of us girls were sitting in the restaurant really cold (and in dresses). Matt Timms, the manager, noticed that we were all cold and came over and offered us his jacket and other jackets he had in the back. He said he couldn't turn up the heater and knew there was a draft that hit our table and wanted to see if he could make it up to us with a jacket. So sweet!  2) I was sick and getting over a cold. I ordered a hot water to soothe my throat. Jen, our server, was so thoughtful and brought over more things for my sickness including extra broth from a soup we ordered, and a hot tea to go with honey for my throat. 3) before we left Matt Timms sent us over a box of warm delicious cookies. They were sooooo delicious! I had maybe 4.... I mean vegas was almost over and it would be a while before I needed to fit into another skimpy dress.  I cannot wait to go to Vegas and Grand Lux again!",

You get three big shrimps, a good size piece of breaded chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was pretty good, reminded me of a Cheese Cake Factory.  Service: Suppper slow. My friends and I came here around 4 on a weekday and it was pretty dead (like only 5-6 other tables had small groups of people).From the time the server took our order until the food came out was about 40-45 minutes! Even the manager had to swing by and check on us and that's when I told him how long we've been waiting (30 mins). After about another 5-10 mins, the food came out. The server didn't even apologies, just dropped the food off and dipped :/  I'd probably come back if I stay at the Venetian or Palazzo again, since the manager stopped by, it shows that someone cared...",

Food was delicious: Korean beef with pancakes and turkey and brie sandwich with fries were each filling yet fresh, so we weren't feeling heavy at the end of our meal. Note: while the Korean beef with pancakes were indeed delicious, I would hardly call it a Korean dish; there were the \"general Asian flavors\" such as ginger, soy sauce, and peanuts, but the Korean beef did not taste of sesame oil nor pear, and the pancakes seemed more flour-based than the traditional Korean pancake. The service was lackluster in my opinion, but I'll let it slide, since I find service tends to go downhill late at night anyway due to the little staff available. Hostess was nice, and quickly showed us to a table. The waiter did not introduce himself, and we were not offered complimentary bread, which we overheard from the other table was because they don't usually do that late at night, but the option was available. Water was not refilled throughout the night, and check took a while to arrive to the table.",

What's great is it's 24/7 so it has been the go/to spot for all hours of the day. They have an all day breakfast selection too if that's what you're craving!  Foodie Favorites: Pastrami Hash, Chicken Pot Pie, pasta Carbonera, CARAMEL MACCHIATO's are a MUST!!!  Service: ALWAYS superb! From greeter's to Waiters I'm constantly impressed!   Ambience: if you have ever been to Cheesecake Factory it's almost the exact same decor ... maybe a bit darker in terms of lighting.  Highly recommend!",

We had a Sunday family breakfast this time, and the Pastrami Hash and Eggs were excellent. As a lover of pastrami, I may be biased. In reality, the unsung star was probably the potatoes. Perfectly seasoned. Sounds simple enough but is rarely executed. The only knock I have? The lighting is dim and my pictures sucked so no photos :)",

I decided to eat here since I had been here before and because it was in the same hotel as where I was staying. I sat at the bar and had an omelette. It was very delicious and it came out pretty quickly. A lot faster then I had expected. I ended up finishing all of it including the few pieces of bread they bring along with it. As soon as I finished my breakfast, I had received a text message stating that my room was ready. Good for a quick bite if you're in a hurry. Not sure how busy they get for dinner.",

    "text": "Came here for a very late night meal with my two aunties on Sunday at around midnight.  We were seated right away and our waitress Debbie came to take our drinks order.  I asked for my usual, virgin pina colada, and my aunties each asked for a cup of coffee.  Our drinks arrived and we were trying to place our food order, which we were indecisive about so Debbie was very patient with us.  I decided on the crab cakes to start off our meal and it was delicious!!  I don't think I have ever had any crab cakes that are that good, even my aunties agreed--saying that they weren't even that hungry to begin with.  I decided to order the ahi ceviche as my main entree.  It was very refreshing & filling, yet not heavy at all.  Although, it got really sour towards the bottom because the lime juice must have all sunken to the bottom of the serving glass.  Auntie Ann had the salmon & lox and that wasn't too bad either.  Although, the salmon was a tad on the salty side...but still tasty nonetheless.  Auntie Bev went with the deep fried calamari as her main dish and we all thought that was very well executed as well.  The batter was crispy and fried to a golden perfection.  It had a few deep fried bay shrimps and veggies as well.  We ended our meal by sharing a creme brulee, which was divine...considering we claimed we weren't too hungry yet ate everything and still had room for dessert.  My virgin pina colada was excellent as well.    Overall, I love the food, and service was excellent.  The fact that they're open 24 hours is a big bonus!  Definitely a place worth returning to...even if there are thousands of other places to eat at in Vegas.",

The powdered sugar and preserves went very well with the sandwich. Tasted excellent. Not as messy or greasy as other ones that I've had.  Other people at our table had a shrimp pasta, the pot roast, kids pizza, and a short rib grilled cheese. Everyone was very pleased with the high quality of food for such a good price.

    "text": "When I'm in Vegas, I'm partial to the Grand Lux Cafe inside The Palazzo (as that's where I stay normally). However, between the hours of 2am-6am, the Palazzo's Grand Lux is closed, and that is where this other Grand Lux, inside The Venetian is clutch. I don't always stay out all night, and so when I turn in early (read: before 6am LOL), this is my go-to establishment for a night cap before knocking out.   I was in town over 4th of July weekend, and came in early on one of the evenings, so I headed over to The Venetian to get some food to wash out all the liquor in my system LOL.  It was around 4:45am, and the place was busy (It's Vegas, what establishment open that late isn't busy on a holiday weekend?). Service was quick. I got seated immediately and the waiter had bread and water to my table within 2 minutes of being seated -- I like that. It's funny, because I think the waiter saw it in my eyes that I had just come in from a long night, and so he brought over 2 glasses full of water and not once asked if I wanted anything to drink beside that LOL.   My late-night staple at the Grand Lux is ALWAYS (100%) the Chicken & Waffle. Always! If you don't know, you better ask somebody! LOL -- That is always a God send after a long night of partying and drinking liquor like it was water LMAO!   I ordered the Chicken & Waffle and the Shrimp Rolls on this occasion, although, I will say, the rolls were overkill -- With the bread they brought out, and the Chicken& Waffle order, that was more than sufficient for me. I still grabbed a couple bites of the rolls, and I will say that while they were tasty, they couldn't overcome the greatness of the Chicken & Waffle.   The waffle is always freshly done, great tasting with the maple syrup, and the chicken tenders oh so crisp, and delicious all-white meat. How could you not love this combo to end the night? I know I do. Both items I ordered were great tasting, and service was top notch, as always.  You can't go wrong with this establishment, and the same goes for the one inside The Palazzo. They certainly will continue to get my business when I'm back in town.",

Located within the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Grand Lux Cafe is good all types of food cravings whether it being breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner or dessert. Came here for lunch during my recent stay here and had the Cajun Shrimp Jambalya which tasted awesome...good flavor, good portion, very filling. Best lunch I had my entire 5 days in Vegas. Added to that I had for dessert the Godiva Chocolate Cheese Cake. I'm already a chocolate fanatic as it is, especially when it comes to cakes....this simply was a-freakin-mazing! Rich chocolate and whipped cream topping....smh...I think I could had eaten that for a week straight and would he alright with that, it was that damn good.   Grand Lux...you did your thing with BOTH food and service. The ONLY thing I would say a negative as far as Grand Lux...too much dim lighting. I damn near had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu and I have great vision. A tad bit better lighting would be good there but other than that, Grand Lux is definite must go if you're looking for fine dining on the strip in Vegas.",

Although our food took a while to come out that's not what bothered me, it was the 15 minutes of awkwardly waiting to ask for our check. I mean the server was nice, but we just rarely saw her.   I ordered the chilaquiles because they're always my breakfast go to. I appreciated the plentiful avocados on it, but overall it was a disappointing dish. There was hardly any salsa on it to soften my chips. They seemed more like nachos if anything. Flavor was good, but the texture was way to crunchy for chilaquiles.   I'd consider trying their dinner dishes, because their breakfast seems just average.",

    "text": "3.5. Stars  We arrived in Vegas pretty late and we found out that Lux is the go-to restaurant for late food without having to stroll down the strip. The restaurant was actually really hard for us to find because we entered through the Palazzo and didn't know there was two and wandered off to the Venetian one, which people say is the better one. It turns out, if you enter through the Venetian front entrance, it's to your right, past the Bellini Bar and right next to JuiceFarm. It definitely reminded me of an upgraded version of Cheescake factory with a dimmer environment but better food and service. Their menu is just as big as the Cheesecake menu and it took me awhile to figure out what type of food I wanted to eat before I asked for recommendations. Because we came late, we didn't have to wait to get seated but I was still surprised how busy it was for a weekday afterhours.   They gave us complementary bread that was right out of the oven to start while we looked over our menu. The waiter was able to give us pasta selections because we wanted something heavy before we passed out after the long drive. I ended up getting the Sunday Night Pasta, which was delicious. The noodles were how I liked it, the meat sauce had really good chunks of beef short rib, and there was just enough parmesan to top it off. My mom got the Lemon Chicken Piccata and it was really disappointing. The sauce was too salty and the chicken was really dry. I actually felt bad for my mom and we switched plates because she hasn't come to Vegas in a couple years and I didn't want her to have a disappointing first meal.  Service was on point, with the waiter checking up on us often and making sure our water cups were never empty. Overall, besides the Piccata, the experience was above average!",

Be sure to get there early too because the waiter mentioned that they tend to run out before breakfast stops being served. I highly recommend the breakfast quesadilla too. It comes with a side of hash brown and sour cream, salsa & guac... Delish! NY steak & eggs is also a good choice if you're not looking for something too out of your comfort zone. Service was good as well, very attentive waiter. A must try if you're visiting Vegas!",

My opinion is keep the menu simple and focus on quality...but I digress 4) The quality of food matches the prices...You get what you pay for.  Con's: 1) Drinks were a little pricy. My husbands entree was less $$ than my Sangria.  2) I ordered the margarita pizza and the crust was limp and soggy...not the best.",

Given the premises I was pleased. As suspected, I wouldn't consider this place classy: Sure, the interior is \"Vegas-classy\" and pretty nice, but the echoes of cutlery, loud conversation and waiters intensely running around takes away any intimacy, which is something I'd require from a classy place.  Food was very quick, and portion sizes huge, so if you're looking for a quick meal this is a good spot. Plating wasn't very exciting, and a but in the pricy side - but taste was good so I still think this is a solid place.  And they have excellent lattes (huge plus).",

The boyfriend and I went in for dinner, it took about 8 minutes until we were even greeted at our table. The server never introduced himself (we later found out his name was Joseph from our tab), we had to ask about 3 times to receive the beverages we ordered (a beer, water and an iced tea), his table side manner was just..plainly put, rude..he wasn't attentive, I felt like we were an inconvenience for him by being there.

Open 24 hours, it's a great place to sober up after the wild night.  It's 4am and we're all hungry. Us being Lucy Y., David G., Sarah A., and myself. Having been here before, I recommended coming here for some early morning grub. We encountered some half naked drunk dudes standing around the restroom outside the restaurant. Good stuff!  We were promptly seated and I was craving breakfast. Ordered the Smoked Salmon with onions and scrambled eggs, it came with hash browns on the side. Simple and delicate at the same time. Contrast of smoked salmon and eggs together created a good plate overall. Filling enough for bedtime.    Pricier than most 24 joints in the hotels, but the food and service is better also. Keep in mind only the late night menu is available after a certain time.",

I will say that illness aside, still a great place to eat, the special was a salmon dish and the soup du jour was clam chowder (shou-deir) and that was rich and creamy. I also had the short ribs and those were really really good, only two ribs, but still tender and juicy.   And also great service as usual.

We enjoyed sitting outside so we could people watch all the other intoxicated clubbers walking around the casino area. I ate here both nights I stayed at the Venetian.

I scarfed half of each down and somehow made my way up to the 10th floor of the hotel to finally knock out.

The menu is extensive and the food is prepared like you're at a gourmet restaurant.  The pasta dishes are amazing, the meat dishes delightful and your appetizers, soups and salads are way above average.  Service is great, but sometimes spotty, but the portions make up for this slight defect.  Go hungry and expect a better meal than at the Cheesecake Factory.",

We came in for breakfast and made sure to come on the earlier side since from previous experiences the line gets long fast.  For breakfast they have a buffet option for $16.99 or you can order from the menu.  For kids the buffet was $9.50 and since one of mine is only 2 years old she was free.  So two kids buffets for $9.50 total is a deal that can't be beat.  I had the chicken and waffles which is a heart attack waiting to happen but was very good nonetheless.  I will definitely be back since the food is good and the servers are attentive and friendly.",

This visit, the kitchen even made my favorite flatbread chicken sandwich even though it wasn't included on the late night menu. Ranch is amazing. My husband had the chicken and waffles and says it was the best he'd ever tasted and a friend's corned beef hash was delicious! Thank you for feeding my belly on hungry Vegas nights!",

It's great bc I never had to wait for a ta  I think I come here at least one or two lunches when I want to eat something decently good. Their salads and sandwiches are perfect for lunch. Also, I always find myself here when I'm hungry at odd hour like 10-11pm at night.  I really enjoy eating at Grand Lux. I honestly think you can't go wrong with dining here. They have something for EVERYONE. Their menu is quite extensive so even the pickiest eater can find something they like at Grand Lux. I highly recommend their sandwiches for lunch and pastas or big plates like their meatloaf for dinner or even 4th meal. Lol. You can't go wrong dining here at Grand Lux!!",

It wasn't bad or anything, but it certainly was not what I'd want for the price I paid.  I ordered the Caramel Chicken and it was pretty bland, essentially tasted like the honey chicken at Pei Wei (which I could have gotten for half the price) and was not in any way unique tasting or as delicious as it was made out to be.  It is likely that I would not go back unless I was staying at the hotel and was feeling really lazy.",

This is nothing extraordinary, but the menu is giant and everything I've tried has been good. It can be pretty noisy during peak times.  I went twice for lunch, and got lunch specials both times. The lunch portions are GIANT, so don't worry about leaving hungry (especially since meals come with free bread baskets). The first time I tried the lunch-size pizza + salad. The pizza was a little on the greasy/soggy side, but still pretty tasty. The second time I came alone and sat at the bar, and I tried the Southwest chicken salad. Really tasty, but a little heavy-handed on the dressing.  Both times the wait staff were very attentive. Prices are very reasonable ($10-$12 for lunch). I was staying in the Venetian and the Grand Lux was right by my elevator bank. I don't know that I would seek it out, but if you're nearby it's definitely a solid choice: good food, good prices.",

We came here after finding out that Bouchon Bistro closes for lunch at 2pm, so started out a disappointing experience.   My husband ordered a cheeseburger and I, eating for 3, got the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. WOW, the food was great!  We started with the spinach and cheese dip that had artichokes in it and was served with a nicely spiced salsa.  My chicken came super crispy, but still very juicy. My husband's burger was a perfect med well and he really liked it. We were both happy, even though we'd wanted to eat at BB.  I took the rest of my chicken to go and gave it to a guy sitting outside the casino and he said he enjoyed it as well, so I wanted to be sure to put that in my review.  Service was a little spotty. Hard to find out waiter sometimes because the place is so huge and drink refills were slow to come.  Not sure we'll be back because there are so many great places to eat in Vegas, but happy to know this place is there.",

The cafe is a lot bigger than it looks from the front, with some seating in the front (with view of the casino floor) and a huge space in the back. The service was good overall, and the waiter didn't stop by so many times that he became annoying (props), but on to the food.  What people say is True, the Asian Nachos are pretty good. Sweet, tangy, savory, and salty with crispy wonton chips and meaty chopped chicken. A plate of these is pretty much a meal in itself.  The avocado-chipotle burger and the delux drive-in burger were both decent, but super greasy.The portion sizes are good though, and they give you a choice to swap sides. I had the salad w/ vinaigrette and it was good (left me feeling a little less fat). But I've been spoiled by Austin so my standards for burgers is a bit skewed...  Price-wise, it's a bit expensive, but I guess \"regular/cheap\" for Vegas. It's a good place to stop by if your hungry and it's late.",

For starters, this place is open 24 hours and on the ground floor of the Venetian...this means that this is the PERFECT place to go to before partying/clubbing and also after your post partying/clubbing activities when you're in a state of drunken stupor.  Food definitely does taste 10x better when you're drunk! LOL.  In any case, I came here for a late lunch one time, and I ordered what I expected to be a light snack - Asian Nachos - but as it turns out, the portions were HUGE.  The Asian Nachos consisted of crispy fried wontons covered with chicken in a sweet-hot peanut sauce that was topped with Wasabi cream and melted cheese...and on top of that, there was fried rice in the middle of the dish. MMM....this dish was pretty yummy!!  In addition to the nachos, I also had a Spicy Calamari Salad which consisted of crispy calamari, organic greens, carrots, cucumber and green onions tossed with a delicious spicy vinaigrette!! This salad also came in a large portion and could be easily shared between 2 people. I highly recommend this salad as it is quite scrumptious!  I would definitely come back here again to try the other items on the menu!",

I have never experienced French Toast like this, but I am hooked and have been since trying it a couple of years ago.  I always order it with a mimosa, freshly sliced strawberries and bananas, and it includes the caramel syrup. OMG!!!    Yum!",

The wait is always minimal, nice atmosphere, great service, fantastic pricing and oh my gosh the food!  Their breakfast buffet is simple but high quality, fresh pastries, fruit, omelette bar and other warm items or you can order off the menu.  Their coffee is also outstanding.  I don't give 5 stars often but this place deserves them.",

I would understand if you're slow because it's busy but when I look around and see empty tables/empty booths....i now think you're just lazy & stupid.  My friend got a sandwich and the bottom bread was soggy (not semi-soggy), it was inedible.  I am a huge fan of chicken and waffles so anywhere and anytime I can get it, I will so that's the only reason we stopped by this place.  My review for the chicken and waffles: They need to use real waffle batter (i'm sure they can afford it).  The chicken was also super dry.  Would I come back?  If I was drunk and it was the only place open....yes....",

My husband  got the chicken parm which was huge. It was a large piece of chicken. It needed a little more flavor but it was good. I like what I got a lot better. We also got these potato spring roll type things with cheese and bacon on them and those were very tasty. The prices were decent and it hit my pasta craving so I was happy when I left.

Oh so lets see. This one is inside the Venetian, directly in off of the casino. They have a patio and also inside seating. We sat at the patio which looks off into slot machine land. Our waitress' name was December, I thought that was so cute! And she was on point. They bring out bread, like at the Cheesecake Factory, but it's BETTER if you can imagine that. I got the pot roast cheese fries that were of the Lord God himself and the soft tacos with pork filling. I can't remember what my friendgirl got, she was shoveling it in her mouth so I know it was good. Then we got an order of beignet AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!! They came with a chocolate sauce, whiskey sauce and raspberry sauce. Oh, they were so good! All in all, a great meal during my Vegascation!",

    "text": "I have to admit, I am impressed with the Grand Lux Cafe.  When you're in the Venetian and looking for a place to eat, you got high-end, food court, and their Grand Lux Cafe.  Just from the gold decor, attentive well-dressed attentive servers, and the ambiance, you'll start thinking this is a pricey restaurant to eat at.  Nope...the Grand Lux Cafe is very affordable and the prices for their cafe/grill food mimics a local Denny's or IHOP.  But that's the just the prices that mimics these chain branded restaurants.  Food quality, presentation, service, and selection is all top notch here at the Grand Lux Cafe.  In other words, you cannot go wrong here.  Grand Lux Cafe serves everything from breakfast to high quality meals like Filet Mignon.  Such a huge selection, I had to ask the waiter to give us extra time to decide.  In the meantime, we got our bread served and it was killed in minutes. For dinner, we shared the calamari which is also served with fried vegetables and fried shrimp.  I don't eat vegetables, but there's something about fried vegetables that makes it go down better.  The calamari was delicious, lightly breaded, and wasn't rubbery.  Yes..I've had overly chewy and rubbery calamari, but not here.  Cristina P. had a salad and I got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with a bowl of soup.  Let me add that there isn't a Crispy Chicken Sandwich on the menu, but all you have to do is ask and sometimes you shall receive.  My chicken sandwich was exactly how I expected it to taste...chicken breast that's golden fried, crunchy, tasty, and perfectly sandwiched in a hamburger type bun.   In all, I have to say that the Grand Lux Cafe is an easy stop if you're hungry, undecided, and in the Venetian.  There's plenty for everyone here and the price is better than most.",

Awesome variety and awesome food. Service was excellent.  They gave us some bread which was very soft and tasted so fresh. Then we ordered the mashed potato egg roll appetizer. It was soo good. For entree I got the combo deal which came with chicken parm and some shrimp scampi. The food was plenty and very good. Chicken parm was on point and so was the pasta. Biggest shrimp I have seen in awhile haha! I almost wanted to drink the sauce they give you with the shrimp.  An upside and downside is it can be relatively loud with people passing by but also you can be in your own world and people watch.  I give 4 stars and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "While we were staying at the Venetian we learned that their main late night option is the Grand Lux Cafe, open 24 hours and actually pretty similar to The Cheesecake Factory but on a grander scale.   I wasn't too excited about eating here since I knew the food was probably similar to The Cheesecake Factory, which to me tastes average. Even though we came with no reservations we still got seated promptly - very happy about that since we were all hungry.   We were in the mood for dinner portion meals so we ordered and shared:  * Spicy Thai Fried Chicken (medium plate): This  was amazing!! Beautiful presentation and the portion just right; chicken was super tender and flavorful too.   *Kobe Burger: Eh, the beef patty was under seasoned and it took forever to come out.   *Fish and Chips. Delicious!! Portion was generous - we were given four strips - plus they came out fresh and deliciously crunchy. The fries that it came with were delicious as well.   The complimentary bread and butter were warm and mm mm tasty.   Service, albeit slow, was still nice and attentive. Not a bad dinner experience, overall, since their massive menu is sure to please every type of eater.",

However if your looking for breakfast comfort food then this will do the spot.  If you are expecting anything more special then this is not the place.  It will do the job in an eloquent setting and the prices are a tad over what a diner would cost ya.  I will say you don't have too many options for American contintental in this casino though.",

    "text": "It's no wonder I like this place, as I really like Cheesecake Factory. Tons of options and rather large servings. Came here before when staying at the Venetian, as it's open 24 hours (or until the wee hours) so always a place to dine whenever you're hungry in Vegas.  We came here for lunch on our first day, and I just wanted a small meal since we were eating dinner in a few hours. The lunch special of half a sandwich, soup, and salad stood out to me and was a reasonable $9. Their complimentary bread was not my cup of tea since it's not very soft, but that was better for me so I could save my appetite for my lunch. The butter here is really tasty though!  Although the restaurant was not busy, our food took forever and a day to come out. When it finally did I was pleased with my dish, as it was a good amount of food for the price. The salad was tasty, and they brought my blue cheese dressing on the side. The chicken mushroom soup was pretty tasty, and they give you a huge cup of it! My BLT however...the bread was so badly burnt, I didn't eat any of the bread. Also, I like my bacon chewy, but these were burnt to a crisp. Stole some of my friends' fries and dipped it in their yummy ranch so I got my fill of carbs.  They also brought out a complimentary birthday treat for my friend, and their whipped cream was light and yummy, and the crisp that came with it was also light and tasty as well.  Overall, we all enjoyed our meals, but just wished service was quicker.",

I opted for the tried and True and struck out several times.   I had no wait to be seated and as I was guided to my table I almost wiped out as I slipped on the greasy floor in front of one of the kitchen door. STRIKE ONE!.  After studying hard to read the menu in the very dimly lit back of the resturant I decided on several items for dinner.  FOOD ORDERED: Salisbury Chopped Kobe Steak  House Green Salad   A guy (manager?) came to me about 10 min after I ordered and told me that the chef did not like the look of the kobe beef, and would not serve it customers. This tells me that they didn't have any kobe beef. Regaudless, I had to pick another choice now almost 20 min into the trip.  STRIKE TWO!  FOOD Re-ORDERED: Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi House Green Salad   WHAT I GOT: House Green Salad ...  my salad and it was very good the blue cheese dressing was exceptional (although they charged me extra for it)  4****Stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VRVeFAfNVQtqdjvAZ23rQQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi ... I was pretty suprised by the entree it had lightly breaded shrimp in a citrius tasting cream sauce, masted potatoes grilled green beans and a thin piece of fried chicken with scallions. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tvJj23joNXjio7SdhYC5QA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> This was not like any scampi I'd ever eaten nor was the chicken although tender very \"royal\".  Both tasted ok but I was not thrilled with what I got. The Mashed potatoes wer good as were the beans even though they were cold.  I finished my meal, the buss lady took away my plates and I waited for my check. And waited, and waited until I finally flagged down another waitress who said she'd inform my waitress, and I waited some more. Finally after 15 min I got a check then had to wait 5 more min for her to run my card. STRIKE THREE!   Grand Lux Cafe YOU're OUT!  The Grand Lux Cafe is is a very nice place with great atmosphere, maybe a tad too dark but it needs to really work on the service.  I will not return to Grand Lux Cafe.",

    "text": "Located inside The Venetian is the Grand Lux Cafe. You cant miss it! It is right by the escalators leading up to parking lot where valet is done. I would describe Grand Lux Cafe as a upscale Cheesecake Factory, but a little bit more expensive. It seems that every single time that I am in Vegas, I end up here. From prior experiences, I would have rated this place a 4-5 star, but it did not meet my expectations this time around. It will definitely make me hesitate whether or not I would want to dine here the next time around. Did my eagerness and excitement for this place finally die?   We arrive and sit in a booth in the bar area because we wanted to watch the Lakers game that was on.   Being in the mood for a burger, I ordered The Max Burger which had certified angus beef topped with cheddar cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, onions and roasted short ribs, with Fries. It was good, but not good where I was jumping with joy.   Our waitress Jina was on PMS the whole night.   She was rude and the gf kept noticing it. I was paying attention to the game so I dont know what exactly was going on. I can tell you what I heard from the gf though. She was working as if she hated her job and did not want to be there. She would roll her eyes whenever we wanted some more water, drinks, etc. She was throwing some of our dishes onto the table. She was telling us to move our drinks out of the way in a rude way so she could set down our dishes. She was fat. She was ugly. She was Jina.",

My sister and I had the Chicken Jambalaya. I went in with few expectations and not expecting to be impressed. Fortunately, I was. It was delicious. The waitress said that fans of spicy dishes loved this; therefore, I was reluctant to order it but I'm glad I did. However, there was waaay to much rice.   My brother ordered the Margherita Pizza. I tried a small slice and it was very good.   Dad had one of their burgers, I forgot which one. It was HUGE. He had to eat it with a fork and knife but loved it.   Mom enjoyed her Chop House Salad. However, it was too big for her to finish.",

It was a bit pricey, sure, but the silverware was quite professionally bound in a white linen napkin. Mmm. Linen. I also remember the clear glass plates. How awesome is that? Who uses glass plates these days...apparently only the cool kids at the G-Lux.   I had one of Hannah W.'s fries. It was utterly perfect, dipped in cold red ketchup. Expect nothing but the freshest, purest ingredients when you first taste the banana creme pie, as well as the two flavors of creme brulee.  It was really dark in there, for some reason. It made me sleepy. But we had also arrived just in time to beat the clubbing crowds who were hunting for a last-minute snack. I love it when that happens.",

Also ordered tomato slices as side with bagel and cream cheese.  Returned to this place for dinner the same day, and ordered the veggie as a meal with 4 veggies, but didn't know it came with a bowl of rice in addition to 4 veggie choices. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered a starch as a veggie. Mushrooms, chili cornbread (starch), spinach, broccoli and bowl of rice. The Chili cornbread was a bit heavy with butter/oil, but was flavorful.  I then returned AGAIN the following morning to order the same awesome omelette, but it wasn't as good. The second omlette was not as fluffy, not as flavorful (less buttery flavor), there was too much spinach, and not enough mushrooms, but it was still a very good omelette.  This was my favorite place to eat on this trip.",

On yet the last occasion, the manager informed me I was confused which restaurant I was in when I told him the squashed 14 inch waffle I was served was not the fluffy Belgian waffle I had been served and eaten at the restaurant for many years. He told me the waffles were always squashed flat.  Honestly, these all add up to a place that I don't want to visit again. I may find another Grand Lux to eat at in the future.

It was morning and I also had a coffee, and at the end the waiter asked if I wanted a fresh cup in a to-go form. I almost cried from happiness.  Best place - will be back next time we're in Vegas!",

This is the second time I have come here and I love love love our server Ashley ! So fun upbeat and friendly!   This time I ordered a peach Bellini - my go to drink. It was surprisingly frozen and delicious - just how I like it!  Yum I wish I would of known this earlier.   The steak sandwich was cooked to perfection, and my husbands pasta ( chicken carbonara) was also amazing.   We came here 3 times during our stay, each time it was great with the exception of the first time when my husband had calamari - it was just ok .   For selection, value, service and hours of operation- you really must try this place! Thanks again Ashley !!",

    "text": "It was pretty late when I arrived in Vegas on a Friday night thanks to a flight delay.  Most of the good restaurants on the Strip were pretty much closed for the night and I didn't really want to settle with McDonald's, Denny's, or White Castle.  And because I didn't rent a car for this trip, I couldn't venture out to my usual late night off-Strip spots like Jinya Ramen or Bachi Burger.  So I decided to hit up my old reliable late night eating spot, Grand Lux Cafe.  When I got there, I wasn't in the mood for a burger since I had one just a few hours earlier before my flight from SFO.  So I went with ordering a couple of appetizers from their late night menu, the Pastrami Reuben Egg Rolls and the Buffalo Chicken Rolls.  I kind of almost regretted ordering two apps though, because the portion sizes for each one were ridiculously huge and could basically be considered a meal on their own right.    Pastrami Reuben Egg Rolls -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1TBZAi2&s=76f76d5e20976b6d37f86ea9480cd595bb13d28b0bb098d5cf80769c72c921e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1TBZAi2</a> Hot Pastrami, Melted Cheese, Sauerkraut and Mustard in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with Thousand Island Dressing and Pickles These were seriously good!  Basically you're taking everything that's awesome from a reuben and rolling them up into crispy egg rolls.  Buffalo Chicken Rolls -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F25jdk39&s=a20c4d765ac34aa37ba0fc9ffea6dae2e87b73e090e2746c75c4999b96ac9201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/25jdk39</a> Chicken Breast, Cheese and Our Very Spicy Delicious Buffalo Sauce all Rolled in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing These reminded me of those buffalo chicken rolls that you get at 7-Eleven, but kicked up several notches.  I liked with how much chicken was in each roll and how the buffalo sauce had a perfect amount of heat to them.  So basically I ordered two sets of uber egg rolls, but it didn't bother me one bit, especially since my waiter said they were two of his favorite apps on the menu.  I was struggling to finish both though because of their portion size, but I pushed through and finished!!    Honey Vanilla Latte -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1sRc7Tb&s=b8c738aca245f1f81fbb1ca9c06dda52aacc278027779bf5321b637b80d13a16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1sRc7Tb</a> Double Espresso, Honey, Vanilla and Steamed Milk I ordered this basically to keep my night going into the wee hours of Saturday morning since my plan was to stay up as long as I could to make up for the lost hours from my delayed flight.   And it definitely did the job.  It was a nice flavor!    All in all, I left Grand Lux Cafe stuffed, very satisfied, and ready to continue my late night gallivanting on the Strip.  I'm glad that they still deliver with quality late night eats!",

The menu has so many diverse and interesting choices on the menu it would be impossible to not find something for everyone to enjoy.  I find the pricing to be very fair; actually, we'd be willing to pay a little more because the food is really good!",

Talk about a Breakfast gone Beast Mode!  Honestly the hubbs and I coulda shared his chicken w/waffles.  This dish is their popular menu selection.  The chicken strips are very well battered, moist and juicy, not so badly fried that the chicken is dried out.  We almost finished it all but had to bring left overs back to our hotel.  I ordered the eggs, hash brown, ham, bacon and English muffin w/a small side of fruit.  Good grief these plates were on point and so filling and then some.  For the price, are you kidding me?  What a deal for so much food.  Again we ordered waters but it was $39 for us.  Convenient, great food and Brian was such an Awesome waiter!  Offered us so many options and fast service on refills and requests.  Definite recommend.",

We weren't very hungry as we'd been to the buffet earlier in the day and didn't want to go very far (especially after we walked all the way to Planet Hollywood the evening before).  We were seated very quickly (honestly we only had to wait as the hostess was seating another party that arrived mere minutes before us) in a lovely little corner booth that was much needed.  Anyway, our waitress quickly appeared with water and answered our questions regarding the food.  I'll be honest, I cannot for the life of me remember what my boyfriend ordered that night, but I do remember what I ordered...mostly because I asked questions about it: the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken and some non-alcoholic refresher drink.  The food wasn't awful, but at the same time I don't believe it was completely memorable either (as you can probably tell).  This was a decent experience as neither one of us were really motivated to find somewhere else to eat - so if you are staying at the Venetian and don't want to go very far or spend very much, this is nice place to go!!",

I love fried chicken, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets, basically any version of chicken that's fried, but I'm not a fan of chicken and waffles, however, these ones blew my mind. The fried chicken was perfectly seasoned and crunchy and the waffle was fluffy and airy. The syrup was sweet but not overpowering and everything tasted so savory and literally melted in your mouth. It came with like four pieces of fried chicken too so they don't skimp!  The buffalo chicken rolls were crispy and full of flavor. The buffalo flavor was stronger than I'm used to but I still liked it. It's listed as an appetizer but it's filling so share with a friend.  I substituted the shrimp scampi with fettuccine noodles because I prefer thicker noodles to thin ones but they were undercooked for my preference. I like my noodles a little softer and these tasted a bit gritty. The dish was overpowered with lemon juice. All I could taste was lemon. Even the shrimps tasted soaked in lemon juice. It was disappointing and not worth the $22.   Pasta carbonara was okay but nothing special. It didn't have much flavor. I wouldn't get it again.  The side caesar salad was about $7. Should've just paid the $3 more to get the entree size.   The waiter checked on us a few times but we had to ask for the complimentary bread after being seated for about 20mins. We didn't realize we were even suppose to receive bread until the two tables seated after us were given bread first and we had the same waiter. Unfortunately, it wasn't anything to rave about. It was bordering cold bread and lacked flavor.   TLDR; Come for the fried chicken and waffles!",

The mashed potatoes melt in your mouth. The vegetables are well seasoned. Everything on this plate is well seasoned and omg mouth watering. Trust me. Perfect for when you're hungover and need a hearty meal haha. ;-)  Those nachos were the best nachos ever. In fact, I cut pieces of my pot roast and put some on the nachos and I'm just drooling thinking about how good it was.  EVERYTHING IS GOOD HERE.   Not pictured are the drinks. We didn't order alcohol as we were already too drunk haha. I had the Pineapple Mint Splash and he had the Passion Fruit Ginger Crush. Both were insanely good but we ordered another Passion Fruit Ginger Crush. Add a shot and boom, the best drink you've ever had.   Come here EVERY time you visit Vegas.  Love you Grand Lux, ever since you were in LA, and sadly left us. I'm still missing the birthday dinners here. Nothing but the best here.",

I came with a couple of friends and they ordered light breakfast, the Benedict and the omelette. They said it was normal and were ok.  After a few hours of gambling and walking around taking pics, we decided to try this place again but for dinner. On yelp it showed that shrimp scampi were on top favorites there so we tried it. We weren't that hungry so we ordered a salad and 2 plates of shrimp scampis to share. The salad was nice and refreshing. The strawberry and pear complimented the salad dressing quite nicely with the cheese as well. Shrimp scampi were delicious. The shrimp was breaded and fried; they had a lot of flavor. The pasta was ok, it had a little too much lemon but the creamy sauce managed to tone it down a little. I'd definitely recommend this place for any hour of the day.",

The burger was good and done correctly (it didn't leak when you lifted it up).  The fries were crisp, hot, and plentiful.  For dinner, I had ordered a sandwich.

Asian Nachos, potato spring rolls and calamari.   The Asian Nachos were just how I remembered.  So much flavor and depth. The spring rolls were cooked just right. I don't generally like Calimari but tried it and it was so good. The batter was great.  Main course. Everyone's food looked great, but I will comment on mine. I ordered the modern Cuban sandwich. It was so good. Crunchy bread, full of flavor. The meat was cooked perfect. I love a hearty bread and this was it. I just wish it was bigger.   The waiter, Kevin, was attentive and there every single time I even thought about needing something. He made us all feel like VIPs. It was a great night.",

This time around the food selection is not as large at night, which was expected but the food was not outstanding.  I would normally expect the opposite since it normally seems that food is that much better after you've been drinking all night long.  Fries were, chewy, not sure if that is the right word but definitely looked like they just came right out of the fryer.  So maybe old, not sure.  Burgers were good but once again nothing special.

Our waiter was super nice and he mentioned that his wife was also a waitress there and they worked the same shift; now that is love people.   Back to the review.   Right from the start the waiter told us that the portions were huge so if we did not eat a lot that we could get a lunch portion or might want to share.  The honesty was refreshing as in Vegas all everyone does is try to up sale.   The food was great. Me and the g/f split a pizza and the LUNCH/half portion Sonoma salad, delish.  As I said about portion size, we couldn't finish that and gave it to one of the many down on their luck people we say on the bridge. Funny thing is that when I gave the half pizza to the homeless couple, the woman looked right at me and said, thank you, god bless, but what I REALLY need is some matches.......you can eat matches?",

The only thing that I heard about this place before we went was that it was a spinoff from the creators of The Cheesecake Factory.  I figured it would probably be good.  We went for breakfast one morning and took our two kids.  My wife opted for the 'Express Breakfast\", aka the buffet.  They had all sorts of fresh fruit, pastries, yogurt, bacon, sausage and breads.  They also had cook to order omlets.  My wife enjoyed it all.  Pretty good for being a buffet.  I ordered the Chilaquiles off of the menu.  I couldn't have made a better choice!  Delicious ranchero sauce, cheese, scrambled eggs, tortilla strips and I'm sure other stuff. All I remember was that it was heaven.  My wife thinks I'm crazy because I kept talking about how good my breakfast was the entire day.  In fact it was so good that we went out of our way to go back the next day for breakfast.  Unfortunately I can't comment on other menu items but the menu was large and varied as others have already mentioned.  Also, the portions are big.

I ate here at least 3 times; the first time was at 3 AM on our arrival night. I ordered a club sandwich, which was pretty good on an empty stomach from my 5.5 hrs drive from LA to Vegas. I ordered the sandwich from the bakery because the line was long for the restaurant itself due to club goers. I was disappointed when the guy at the register told me that the wait time will be 40 mins. 40 mins for a sandwich! He was lucky I was hungry!        A few days later I grabbed some lunch from the bakery, I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and a Caesar salad. The pizza was really good and satisfying. The salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty. My friends had ate some lunch from the cafe about 30 mins earlier, when my boyfriend and I arrived at the suite we were luckily to have some of their calamari. The calamari is to die for!! It comes with an array of dipping sauces and in the mix of calamari - there are some pieces of zucchini. After bites and bites of calamari, it's refreshing to take a bite of the soft zucchini. It helps balances the taste of the calamari. Especially with fried foods, after a handful I'm usually sick of the greasy taste in my mouth. The calamari at Grand Lux is fried perfectly and keeps you wanting more. The portions of the food is pretty good too.        On my next Vegas trip, Venetian and Grand Lux are definitely on my hit list.",

Right below the rooms, around the corner from the guest elevators and open all night.  When we went, it was 3:30am, we were all buzzing, tired and STARVING. We were sat rather quickly, despite the line, served water and menues, had our orders taken, then left alone... For forever.   After about twenty minutes, a waitress swooped by and dropped some bread on the table. We get bread?? About forty-five minutes after that, we're all falling asleep on our table and our waiter comes by to apologize for the wait. He said everybody ordered breakfast all at once and the cooks are overwhelmed. Understandable enough... Until we looked around and no one in the restaurant is eating. If they're cooking, shouldn't SOMEONE be eating?  Fast forward another half hour and we decide to cancel our order with the waiter and go upstairs, right then, of course, our food shows up.   Now, there are 260+ reviews that will tell you the same thing, but just to be another to say it, the food was delicious!! Of course it was delicious! I was a little sad that I couldn't finish it all. I got the Chicken Flautas, they were crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside and the avocado sauce was just spicy enough. It's apparently one of the more popular late-night orders, along with the Buffalo Eggrolls, which I was told were also kind of perfect. My friend that ordered the Egg White Omelette said it was THE BEST omelette he's ever had. That's as good as it gets, literally! So I don't know, is the amazing food worth an hour and a half wait in the middle of the night? Your choice. Be drunk enough to not care or not hungry enough to notice.",

    "text": "The last few times they've disappointed.  They do not have as good of service compared to when they opened, over 10 years ago.  Also they have smaller portion sizes..... They really don't have the level of quality control that they once had, either.    And they are not getting any cheaper.  I'm all for the same food and a more expensive menu. But when the food quality and consistency drops and then the price goes up.... that is bad business.  We've stopped recommending them as we once did.  Years past we'd  tell everyone they had to go but now we don't.    Hopefully, they revert back to the good times.  PS~ this review is for the original Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian.  Not the newer one.",

If this seems similar to Cheesecake its because it is!  Its part of it.   The portions are HUGE.  You hardly ever have to wait for a table.  Its pretty casual yet the decor is very GRAND.    There are so many things on the menu that someone is bound to love something.  They are quick with service and its the go to spot if you want something better than the McDonalds, Chipotle and less expensive then the places in the hotels where you HAVE to make a reservation.   You would never think such nice expensive hotels Venetian and Palazzo would have something like this but it does exist!  I'll come here ONLY after I've gone to the Buffet at least once during the trip. haha  Oh PS the wait staff is super friendly.  The waitress is giving my friend a super hug. haha. So Vegas",

I had the Miso Glazed Salmon because I wasn't feeling good at the time and didn't feel like eating lots of beef and heavy meat soo I ordered the salmon.   The dish was soo huge and the piece of fish was gigantic, so big I took only a few bites and I was done!! I should of shared with someone which was downfall.

Located in the Venetian, this is the sister restaurant to cheesecake factory so expect it to look the same- huge venue with a lot of the same variety and eats on their menu.  Just minus the big ass cheesecake menu, though they still have some on the menu.   I think this is a good place to hit up when you have a big party (came here for a bachelorette weekend) and you just want something casual.  I'm a cheesecake factory fan so I liked this place too.  *Chicken lettuce wraps- It's no PF Changs lettuce wraps but it's still ok.  Huge portion too, I ended up sharing it with others.  *Margarita pizza- can't go wrong with this and it was good here.  *Sunday Night Pasta- meat sauce w/ chunks of beef short rib, mushrooms, onions, garlic and parmesan cheese.  This was sooooo good!  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Wish they had it at the cheesecake factory in SD.",

Nice people and very nice restaurant.  2.) Drinks were good, I can recommend the Bloody Mary. 3.) Chicken and Waffles was great, plenty of food and the syrup was good.  4.) Reasonable priced given the decor and food.   CONs: 1.) Wait staff took a while to get the order and bring the food. They were nice and it did not look that packed but it did took a bit too long  Final: We would go back",

Best part of this place has to be all their pasta dishes.  I haven't ordered a pasta dish yet that I haven't liked.  Everyone defiantly has to try the pasta dishes if you ever get a chance to come out here.  I've also had  a chance to try some of their appetizers and breakfast food and it was delicious!    A couple of the YELP reviews below were complaining that it was a Cheesecake Factory owned place.  Doesn't really matter to me since their menu is completely different than Cheesecake Factory.  Overall a great cafe to try in Las Vegas.",

I had originally walked over the Palazzo location Friday night for dinner at 8pm but was turned away due to a kitchen problem?  Anyway, it was a short and quick walk over to this location.  I was quickly seated on a Friday night and it took my server a bit of time to get to me.  Its okay because I had bread and water and the extensive menu to look over since there is tons of choices!  My server did not mention the specials to me...I overheard the other server next to me tell his tables the soups and specials for the evening.  I usually never order specials but it would of been nice to hear her mention it to me as well.  Anyway I decided on the Sunday night pasta entree ($18) and a side broccolini ($5) for my little one!  It was a good choice!  I loved the taste and the soft stewed meat in the pasta dish. It was different but very tasty!  Loved the side order of broccolini as it wasn't drenched in butter or oil like some other places, just steamed like how I like it!  Flagging down my server for the bill and a box took a bit longer than usual, I was in a rush though, I had a flight to catch in a few hours, so maybe she didn't want to rush my Friday night dinner.  So no biggie, she didn't know.  All in all, I loved this place.  Big portions, good food, and a great atmosphere!",

I requested a side of horseradish and mixed it in my whipped potatoes. Man, it was bomb...gave it a lil' spark (no pun intend), which I like.

The asian entrees is way too salty thought, but if you're into that. The Chinese chicken salad is good. Vegetables are fresh and they give you tons of chicken! Winner winner chicken dinner!

I tell you, without the cheese you could really taste the quality of the beef and the spiciness of the peppers...and then the coolness and texture of the avocado.

I love this place, huge 25ft + ceilings, dim lighting and a rich, tastefully decorated dining room.  The food was wonderful, all eight of us were enjoying every morsel and the prices were quite resondable for the quality.  I had the chicken Madeira which is such a savory delight - I would recommend it to the pickiest of eaters.  It comes with rich, creamy mased potatoes and perfectly grilled asparagus.  We were all eyeing the desserts but no one dared to take the plunge because we had a long night of dancing ahead of us.  Only minor complaints - first our waiter spilled part of a pomegranite martini down the back of my freinds dress - good thing for him the dress wasn't white... could you imagine!  And for some reason the floors were super slick, it was like someone had waxed them with Crisco.  I kid you not, you had to hold on to something to keep from slipping.  Whoops! I smell a lawsuit.  BOTTOM LINE:  A superb restaurant for just about any occassion.  If you're a first timer go for the specialty items, you're sure to find a new favorite dish.",

First night, I was so borderline drunk that I wasn't sure if the food was gonna make me feel better or worse. I gambled, just like I always do in vegas, just this time with barfing... Anyhow ended up okay, all 3 of us held it down.   2nd night I was drunk and made up drama in my head.  3rd night we were all fudged up, we went back to the room and someone thought it was a good idea to get food and bring it to the room. Great memories that night... inappropriate to share on yelp.  Oh yeah, so the food is pretty decent for the price here.",

(That part was kind of a bummer, because I hate travelling and eating somewhere I could have been at home.) Turns out, they started it/own it/whatever.  Two colleagues and I were looking for a \"normal\" (not fancy!) place to have dinner, after a few nights of vendor-sponsored dinners at very high end restaurants. Saw this place had good Yelp reviews so we checked it out.  I had the ahi salad, and it was delicious. A good amount of ahi, and avocado, and a yummy dressing. Also had a pear martini which was decent - not great,  but fine. (The waiter told me their drinks were strong. I didn't agree but also admit my perception is somewhat skewed!) My colleagues had a pulled pork sandwich and fish and chips, and both were happy about their selections. One said the coleslaw was some of the best he'd ever had.  VERY nice service (including giving three people four checks so that we could each expense our food separately, and me leave the martini off the expense report!) and good food.  Prices were also quite reasonable for Vegas and the Venetian, and pretty comparable to if you were at the Cheesecake Factory.",

Everything mimicked Cheese Cake Factory. From the menu to the to go boxes and bags. Not that it was a bad thing...just a fact.  So about the manager. I ordered a bloody mary and it was GROSS. The waiter barely ever came by to check on us so I waited till we asked for the check to tell them I didn't like it and wanted it taken off the bill. Well the waiter said he had to get a manager to do that....ok fine. So the manager comes over and I told him that it was gross and I would appreciate it if he could take it off the bill...He replies, \"I will do that for you, but next time you need to tell us when you get the drink and realize you don't like it.\" WHO THE CRAP speaks like that to a customer. I would expected him to be apologetic and nice, but nope...onree asshole is what I got.   All the tables are super crammed together and it was really packed when we sat down (at around 12 o clock on a Sat). I've eaten here before, but I don't know if I'd do it again.",

They are conveniently open 24 hours a day serving everything from buffet breakfast, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night. It's the improved version of its parent Cheesecake Factory restaurant.   Our group ordered breakfast dishes, burgers, potato rolls, and dessert after leaving Tao at around 3:30am. Although I am not a drinker, I always look forward to post-bar grub with buddies. I adore late-night dining. Healthy, right?  Our waitress was very patient and sweet, despite one of our group members passing out at the table and others slurring + much louder than they should have been. Good food, great service = perfect go-to cafe for late night eats.",

My favorite is their Chili... great corn bread with it!... my friends love the Pasta Telefono. The chicken and waffle is so-so, not bad, but nothing spectacular. The smoked salmon dish is not bad, nothign special but fresh. I use to love their chicken piccata, but the last time i had it, it wasn't so good (the previous 3 times were good :)... their clam chowder is amazing! and their chopped salad was not bad. Good size chopped ingredients and not over dressed so it didn't get too soggy near the end. At first I was nervous about ordering a chopped salad b/c i'm a stickler on texture and dressing... but was pleasently surprised.  I have to note, girls becare of the floor. It's quite slick so if you're there with heels on, tread carefully.  :)  Also note, there are two... one in the Venetian, near Tao, and the other in the Pelazzo. Both are good.",

The menu is huge and took a while to look over. I ordered the half soup and salad lunch special. The chicken salad sandwich was good, nothing overly special. The chicken tortilla soup didn't have enough spice and was a little cold. Overall, the food was decent but the problem was the service. Being in my early 20s I felt we did not receive as good as service as some of the older diners. We didn't receive a bread basket and our food took a lot longer to be brought out than others who were seated way after. Prices were fair, food was decent but the service could use some improvement.",

We ate there right after we checked in and everything we ordered was on point. It kept  me full for hours. I wish i could have tried one of their ready to bake desserts because they sounded delish!   Our waiter was cool, but, I think he was trying to practice his amateur comedy stand up routine on us. After awhile, I felt like saying, \"Ok! Enuf! Just get me more bread!!\" Hahahahaha!

I'm usually in a group of 6 or more, and we've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.  Service is good, which can be hit or miss when you're with a large group.  They start you off with warm bread, and will refill it if you ask.   I order the Pasta Telephono, it's amazing with toasted bread crumbs on top.  It's a big portion, so share or don't eat the whole day in preparation!  I've also had the Caprese Salad and the Greek Salad - two of my favorites.

There are too many options on the menu that you would have to ask the waiter to give you extra time to choose which one will satisfy your appetite. I had a plate combination of shrimp scampi and sirloin steak for dinner.  The scampi was really good that I intend to try and make it at home.  I requested for my sirloin to be medium rare. I wished it was redder.  I probably should have  asked for rare. But it was just sirloin so I guest that was okay.  If it was ribeye or filet, I'd throw a fit!  Price is reasonable.  I don't quite remember what happened when he we had breakfast here, which was after clubbing,  I  know I paid my bill though...haha. Reserving a table before coming to the restaurant would be best.",

Me and my friends came here at 2am-ish friday night (or saturday morning i should say) after a long drunken night out. I really like that it's open all the time, that its right next to the elevators up to the rooms and that we didn't have to wait very long for seating. We ordered the calamari, some kind of sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. The calamari tasted soooo gooood, spinach artichoke dip was really good, and I dont remember much about the sandwich but I'm sure it was fine.   We came here saturday night too, also after a long night out. This time we came with 12 girls so we had to wait a little longer for seating but it was still pretty fast (also probably because it was 2-3am in the morning). Our table split chicken and waffles, calamari (yes again because it was so good) , some kind of pizza and some other dish with egg or something but I didn't get to try it. Everything was pretty good from what I can remember. I think we ordered maybe 7 dishes in total and the bill came out to 100 something dollars.  If you do go there, I'd say get calamari for sure because its really delicious (cant go wrong with fried stuff). Spinach artichoke dip was also really good but I think its usually good no matter where you get it. Chicken and waffle (one big waffle) were just eh. Grand Lux is affiliated with cheesecake factory and I can see why, it really does remind me of a more expensive cheesecake factory. But still, if youre staying at the venetian, its a great convenient place to go after a night out.",

The reason I'm writing this review, though, is I got an eclair at the bakery and it's the ideal eclair. It is the third or fourth eclair I've had in three days in Vegas and it's the only eclair that was 1) really good and 2) worth the money. The other eclairs I had were just about as much money ($3.95) but this one was four times bigger, filled with a ton of custard AND whipped cream, was covered in just the right amount of good quality chocolate, and was filling without being too rich. It wasn't dry like the other eclairs either. I will probably get another one later.",

The first time I ate here was this past summer, on a not so busy Sunday late afternoon. We were seated quickly but took 1.5 hours for our food to come! When asked what the delay was, management actually came out, apologized and said my friend's sandwich had to be remade because it was dropped on the ground. Fine.  As for yesterday, we also came for brunch and were a group of 6, we were seated right away because it wasn't so busy. Great because we were starving. Our waitress took 30 minutes to come and introduce herself, and disappeared for a long while-- we had to ask other staff if we could please put in our order (we were starving). She finally took our order, but later on came out to tell us she would be leaving and we would have another server. After 1 hour of waiting for our food to come (and not seeing our new waitress since the switch) we noticed that we were never even given the complimentary bread that all the other tables received. We asked another server (not ours, she was still missing) if we could have bread and by that time our server was coming out with our orders, which were ALL COLD. The food is great at this place-- I've had the fried chicken strips and waffles, and the corned beef hash-- I hate to give it a poor review, since the chefs and cooks seem to have it on point!

Food took forever and our food tasted like something from a fast food restaurant.   Spinach Artichoke Dip Appetizer -- creamy, cheesey and bland. Needed salt.   Mushroom Burger (second hand opinion) -- it was good.  Strawberry Smoothie (second hand opinion) -- it was good.  Steak Burger (second hand opinion) -- it was not good, something you can get at Carl's Jr for $6.00.   Mediterranean Salad w/ Avocado and Turkey -- I asked for no cheese and they still put it in. I looked past that and tried to enjoy my salad while pushing the cheese aside. I felted jipped for the $5.00 extra for the turkey and avocado. Mini turkey cubes that were the size of mini M&M's looked more like a garnish rather than a $$ add on (see picture). The avocado were bland and had no flavor. Overall -- this Mediterranean salad is a rip off and not good at all.    Not our choice to dine here, but we went with the flow and enjoyed it the best we could. There will definitely be no repeat visits in the future.",

But, don't be sad that it's a chain...because it's pretty dang good and quite a value for a Vegas casino!  ---FOOD--- This place has a HUGE variety of options on the menu. Here's what we got:   1) Ahi Tuna Burger, $15ish - It was HUGE!!! The tuna was seared perfectly well and coated in a spicy grounded pepper mix that paired really well with the aioli they served. My favorite touch to this burger was the thick whole-grilled red onion slice.   The burger also comes with fries, but you can opt. for a different side: I opted for the steamed brocolli that is NOT slathered in butter (thank goodness) -- they steam whole heads of brocolli for you. How unique. Ha.   2) Polynesian Salad, $14ish - VERY huge and fresh tasting. Sweet, tangy sauce over greens with chicken slices and lots of other excitement I can't recall.. - Loved how they top the salad off with whole pieces of fried wonton instead of mixing in bits and pieces into the salad. It's great because it gives u the option of NOT eating the friedness (cuz...u know...it would be healthier that way) and makes the presentation look cooler simultaneously!  3) Sunday Night Pasta, $17ish - VERY VERY huge! Meaty! Very savory! My friend could only eat 1/3! =P  4) CREME BRULEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, $7.50ish -- GET THIS!!! - For this price, you get TWO huge servings of a vanilla and chocolate delicacy with a waloop of whipped cream that easily satisfied 3 people!!! SO GOOD!!!!  ---SERVICE--- Friendly, attentive, efficient. We didn't have to wait at all for a seat (Friday night, too!).   ---AMBIANCE--- The place is huge! And the decor is pretty much...Cheesecake factory. I love how it's so casual, yet still elicits an elegant feeling.   ---VALUE--- For a restaurant in the middle of one of Vegas' most popular casinos, it's definitely a winner!",

It rings up at $46 and I happily pay it, a bit oblivious to what I had just ordered.  \"It'll be ready in around 22 minutes sir.\"  \"Huh.\" *turns around and stumbles off back into the casino*  22 minutes later (what was I doing that entire time?) -- I'm handed a massive bag with what appears to be an astronomical amount of food...like takeout for a family of four. Oh holy hell what have I done?  So I trek up to my room at the Venezia tower and I settle myself in front of the sunken living room area TV...two of my friends are urging me to unload my Santa bag of goodies. \"Dude...I think you're drooling, but I don't think you're going to get in on this...\"  So out pops two separate bags with generous portions of fries, a box with a ribe-eye steak, and a second box with pasta carbonara in it. Haha. I'm so happy.  So naturally, I just ditch the fries and go right for the steak. Now, it was more like a medallion, than a good hearty helping of rib-eye. Relatively tiny portion and to my disappointment was too chewy and well done. Didn't help that I had to cut it with a plastic cafeteria knife. Bleh.  I then move onto the pasta. This is where things got good. I mean REALLY good. Who would have thought that the pasta carbonara with no peas, bacon bits, and a creamy garlic cream sauce that night could be so magical? I tear through the entree like a homeless man tasting food for the first time in weeks.  Grand Lux Cafe, I'll be back. And thank you for being open 24 hours. I will not settle for a penny-saver meal at McDonald's, even if I am broke and $200 in the red on my Mastercard from casino ATM cash advances. I am so excited to try the duck meat pot-stickers next time.  Oh, and the neighboring The Palazzo has a Grand Lux Cafe too? F Ya. Drunken munchies here I come!!  - 2 stars for the rubbery steak. - 5 stars for the pasta carbonara.",

That said, the food was pretty good.  I ordered the Crispy Szechuan Tofu, which was extremely salty (too much soy sauce) but still enjoyable.  Asparagus is a funny vegetable to put in that kind of dish, though.  My friend got a chicken caesar salad and it was huge!  She paid for it so I don't know what the prices are like.  I did like the ambience at the Grand Lux Cafe.  All you can see from outside is a tiny seating area, so that seems to explain the long lines, but when you get back into the restaurant it turns out to be quite spacious.  (How do they fit all these giant places into one building?!)  My friend and I got a nice curved booth that could have seated at least two more people.  Despite the large size of the room, our booth was still very intimate, and the service was very good.",

Was here for lunch on a weekday between Christmas and New Years and was seated rather quickly near the bar area.  The waitress explained the offerings were large and there were lunch portions available.  I ordered the Strawberry lemonade and Hot Brown.  My friend ordered the Pasta Del Sol and a Spicy Bloody Mary.   For an appetizer we ordered the Fried Shrimp, Calamari, and Vegetables.  Drinks came out and Strawberry lemonade came out a bit sweet and I had to water it down with some water.  The Bloody Mary tasted nice and spicy and no hint of booze!  The appetizer came out quick and it certainly was enough for 4 as an appetizer.  Eat this quick as it will get greasy towards the end.  The waitress checked up on us and said the mains should be ready and after a small delay they came out.  My Hot Brown which is an open faced turkey sandwich on thick toast with cheese sauce was larger than expected and served separately with a side of fries.    The sauce was very rich and was slathered over the entire plate.  I had to dig into the bread and fries to cut the richness of this cheesy sauce.  I cannot comment on the Pasta as I only had a small bite.  Service was exceptional as the drinks and water were refilled well and the waitress even help box the rest of the uneaten Pasta Del Sol.    When asked for dessert, we declined, but the waitress did mention that they were open 24 hrs.  The group seated next to us ordered the lunch portions of salad and they certainly were sufficient for lunch.  I certainly would go for a lunch portion next time, if you aren't completely famished.",

Yeah it is like an upscale Cheesecake Factory. It looked nice enough and was packed. Service was excellent.   They bring out a warm loaf of bread while you check out the enormous menu. They're open 24hours and their menu is divided by times of the day so make sure you're looking at the right section. I ordered the Pasta with Chicken, Sun dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms. At first it was good but then the chicken was gone, then the tomatoes and mushrooms, and all that was left was a mass of pasta. I was already full by then but I wasn't really impressed by the dish.   I got to taste the Sunday Night Pasta - \"Made Fresh Every Day! A Rich Slow Simmered Meat Sauce with Chunks of Beef Short Ribs, Steak, Fresh Mushrooms, Onions, Garlic and Parmesan Cheese. Served over Spaghettini.\" Tell me that doesn't sound good. Good thing I didn't order it. The \"chunks of beef short ribs and steak\" tasted like shredded beef.   We went back there at around 5am after the club and food-wise it was a better experience. For a table of 6 we must've waited about 20mins though. The Deluxe Breakfast Sandwich was GOOD! Scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, ham, grilled tomato, and Havarti cheese on grilled brioche bread. Probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! The eggs were so fluffy, the meat was savory, and the melted cheese was delicious. I don't care for hash browns.

We were very happy with your kind wait staff and caring managers. The breakfast buffet was just what we needed and for $15 that was great! The late night, giant grilled cheese for $6 was out of this world.   The turkey club sandwhich was really terrible though, so thats the one thing I can say needs some work ont he menu. New bread, cut it smaller like a club and use a juicier thinner sliced turkey.   Honestly thank you for being around and adding a good option to all the choices in Vegas.",

Nice for people watching. I went at lunch and had a really nice server named Adam L. (at least that's what the receipt said). I recommend the WARM baked-to-order chocolate chip pecan cookies. You can eat some and take home some to eat later. The smell is so rich, and they bring them right out of the oven already nicely packed in a box. I brought some back to my hotel, but the cookie monster ate my leftovers the next day. :( I was sooooo sad... a little consideration would've been nice. I guess the cookie monster really liked them. I was SOOOO looking forward to eating one the next day.  Only gave them 4 stars because I'd have to go back to try something else off the menu worth raving about besides the cookies. Oh yeah, their cafe latte is EXCELLENT with the cookies. No sugar needed if you have the latte w/ the cookies. It's a nice balance.",

We wanted to have dinner in the same casino and I've heard rare reviews of Grand Lux so off we went.  I have to admit, I'm not a Cheesecake Factory kinda gal.  I've never liked it... but this sister joint?  AWESOME!!!  My friend had the swordfish which was sooo good and I had the chicken lasagna.  Both dishes were soooo good and very good portions, we couldn't finish them.  On top of the food we both had strawberry martini's which got the night started right.   I hear there's a new location in Scottsdale so I will definitely be checking that out SOON!",

    "text": "So it's after midnight, you're staying in the Venetian and realise that since you slept in and thus had lunch at 3pm, and then had tickets to a show at 9pm so didn't eat beforehand, you're now starving and there's not a lot of options.  You could walk down the strip to one of those $5 steak-and-eggs places, or the $1 hot dogs, or you could stay in the hotel and go to the only restaurant that's still open.  So you make the obvious mistake.  It's not really a restaurant, it's actually a slightly-modified version of the Cheesecake Factory.  Any place that has the word \"factory\" in the name isn't a restaurant.  They're serving you something that might once have had something in common with food but was sent to a factory, fried and then frozen, and then shipped out all over the US to be heated up in microwaves.  They're serving you food that is actually worse than Hot Pockets.  My waiter was totally stoned.  I don't just mean a little stoned, I mean falling over himself and barely able to walk upright.  Everyone seated in his section kept on looking at each other and rolling their eyes at him.  He thought he was suave and pulling it off, and was so stoned that he never noticed the giggling from everyone who had to deal with him.  Even the busboy was making fun of him.  The food is just what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory: fried food in massive portions and completely lacking in flavor.  It's totally quantity over quality.  It has exactly two redeeming qualities: it's available at 2am, and it doesn't require you to leave the hotel.  But next time, do yourself a favor and walk down to get the $5 steak-and-eggs.  You won't hate yourself so much afterwards.",

    "text": "Before I decided to move to Las vegas, this is probably one of the casual dining restaurants that we visit the most often when we are in town for CES or bachelor parties.  I know it is pretty much just a Cheesecake Factory with a different name, and you can get pretty much get the same food and cheesecakes without flying/driving all the way out to LV, but everytime we ate at this Grand Lux Cafe, the experience has always been a positive one.  The food overall is pretty good, decent sized portions and fairly priced for a restaurant located inside one of the busy Strip casino. The menu selection is huge, and can be difficult to decide what to order if you are not familiar the menu, but the staff is quick to offer suggestions.  On my most recent stop here after catching Jersey Boys, we didn't have to wait long to get seated.  The food I ordered that time was just okay (but I have enjoyed what I ordered previously, which was mostly pastas, instead of the special being promoted).  Service was good, frequent refills on my iced tea, and when we were ready to settle our bill we didn't have to wait too long for that.  The only thing I didn't like was the appetizer platter and most of their Asian-inspired appetizers, which I thought were mediocre at best. But all of their pasta entrees that I have tried have been good, and I will drop by when I am in the mood.  4 stars.    And during AVN/AEE convention in January, we can do a lot of people watching while waiting to be seated, since a lot of the adult entertainment stars come down the escalators in front of this Grand Lux Restaurant.  And the big draw is the fact that they are open 24 hours a day, so a decent grub is available all the time if you are in the Venetian.",

On this night, one of the people in my group was complaining how hungry he was. I instantly recommended grand lux because I knew that it had a million items on the menu.   My favorite item is the potato egg roll which is basically mashed potatoes with bacon wrapped and fried and served with sour cream. Yum! One of our group got calamari which was surprisingly melt in your mouth at 3 am.   The menu is very extensive and there is something for everyone including alcohol and even gluten free options.   The location is convenient in the Venetian and the prices run around $5-$20 depending on what dish you order.",

We came because when we tried it several years ago, it was pretty good. boy, has it changed over the years, and only for the worse.   From what I remember, we ordered the chicken pot pie, pasta telephono, and chicken Alfredo. Though I don't remember what the other two ordered, I do remember that all of us left that place unsatisfied and quite disappointed. --Chicken pot pie had a great flaky crust, but the filling was boring, bland, and watery.  -Pasta telephono was extremely cheesy (too much for my taste) and had an extremely weird and unexplainable taste. Definitely not recommended.  -Chicken Alfredo was just an average chicken Alfredo, nothing exciting.  Service was pretty average and the place was decently crowded, considering the fact that it was a pretty big place. We dined at around 8 on a Tuesday night. But overall, this place was a last minute decision for us since it was located in our hotel and we are definitely not coming back. my advice: don't bother wasting a night here; try mon ami gabi at the Paris hotel, it has excellent food!",

There is one downside and that is that it's built like a street side cafe which means that you should ask to sit in the back, as the \"outside\" part is right on the casino floor thick with choking cigarette and cigar smoke.  Now for the food. We were there for breakfast and I ordered the house-made corned beef hash (CBH). Breakfast for 2 arrived - and that was just mine! Along with the CBH were hash browns (superfluous since the CBH was 25% hash browns already) and a large amount of fresh fruit. And the taste? YUM!!! I will be back!",

    "text": "Thank youuuuu Venetian for hitting up Mr. Overton, founder of The Cheesecake Factory.  I wonder how many meetings it took to concoct the greatness we know as Grand Lux Cafe.  I make it a point to stop by whenever I come out to Sin City.  In fact, we ate here two nights in a row during the last trip.  Just doesn't get old!  So convenient after a night out if you're staying at the Venetian.  The location is RIGHT next to the guest room elevators.  You can't just pass by Grand Lux and not eat on the way back to your room.  That's preposterous!    Come here to satisfy your drunken munchies, soak up that alcohol with their complimentary bread n buttah, or even order a few more drinks.  I don't know about you guys, but I need something crunchy and guilt-ridden when I got the drunk munchies.  The crispy flautas from the appetizer menu is a blessing from above.  Just check out my picture (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fuoo08O3ZAgdWMET_-M-cHg%2Fl&s=43b1a7eb09a7ff239c479ca4b3b49f810f281f2553d23f93163382b225ccc57d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bp...</a>).  With the avocado sauce it comes with, this lil snack can be enjoyed intoxicated or not.  SO good.  If it doesn't tickle your fancy..there's still so much to choose from the late hour menu.  It's not as extensive as the daytime menu but you still got your breakfast plates, sandwiches, salad, pasta, etc.  During normal hours, I absolutely MUST have my spicy flat bread chicken sandwich.  Grilled chicken, pepperjack, and all the usual fixings on a pita-like bread split into 4 quarters.  Its corn salsa is the perfect topping.  They lay on a little bit of the chipotle mayo sauce, but I always ask for more for the side of fries it comes with.  You guys really gotta order this at least once.  It's a pretty large amount of food -- I always gotta half it with someone.  Service is always great & I've never had to wait over 5 minutes for a table, but I may have been lucky each and every time.  Wish I had the same kind of luck at the adjacent slots and black jack tables. Hmph..",

I've only had their Fettuccine Alfredo which was delicious.  The price is average. However, the service is not as good as you would expect it to be. I would assume it's because people usually come here at the wee hours and drunk. So, they don't need to provide excellent customer service.  I possibly would dine here again, but I just end up at some buffet.",

    "text": "First time staying at the Venetian and I came here not knowing that this place was open 24 hrs! I wish I had tried the breakfast menu, but I got there just in time for the transition into lunch. The food items are all over $10 (many of the finer dishes are $20+) so don't expect a cheap dine in session at all.  I ordered the beef wellington plate since I've never had that before (and I saw it on a Gordon Ramsay video), and oh my god, that plate had some of the tastiest and most flavorsome beef and the mushroom combo I've ever tasted! So juicy and you can taste the marinade through the veggies. Would definitely want to eat this again (once I try everything else on the menu of course).  The only reason I rate this place 4 stars is that we waited 10 min in line and 20 min before our waitress was ready to take our order. Sucked but it was packed that Sat morning that I went.",

    "text": "This review is specifically on their breakfast.   Hear me out: you just woke up (if you're staying at the Venetian) and you're checking out some of the nearest breakfast joints. Room service sounds alright but those prices...not so friendly. Some of the restaurants on the strip sound pretty good (the ones with higher rating) but kinda far and you need food now. This is where this place comes into play.  I was a little apprehensive, but this restaurant had high ratings and the pics on here made the food look pretty good. But when it comes to breakfast, I don't want pretty good, I want GREAT. I'm a simple person and I'm not looking for fancy-shmancy. This  restaurant knocked it out the park!!! They have a $19.99 breakfast buffet that includes your choice of drink that seems to be their most popular choice but personally I'm not too fond of buffets. I ended up ordering the 3 eggs/toast/hashbrown /bacon plate ($13.95) and the portions were HUGE!! 3 eggs? I don't think so, it looked more like 5 and the hash browns are a very generous amount. Total of 5 bacon strips and 4 slices of toast. I had coffee with my breakfast, this was a little steep ($4.50) but unlimited refills.   Overall, if you want a GREAT breakfast, this is your place! Especially if you're staying at the Venetian!",

Everyone in your group will find something that they like. The place is open 24/7 and it doesn't matter how dressy or casual you have dressed because there is no judgement there.   I always try to try something different. My favorite is their omelettes which allow up to four ingredients inside and comes nice and hot. Each meal comes with sides and the portions are huge. The drinks are okay here but not the very best. The only thing is that the menu is so big that sometimes that the dish isn't executed that well. The service is usually great and there is never too much of a wait in line even when the large restaurant is full.",

It doesn't judge - show up in whatever, even a swimsuit with a cover, and they'll find you a table. Don't like your table? They'll find you another! Stumbling drunk? It's ok, they got you covered. It is also fantastic for people watching btw!   The first time I went to Grand Lux it was to meet some friends who had started drinking at the bar there. Initially I wasn't going to stay, but the waitstaff quickly found room for all of us without batting an eye. The drinks are huge and stiff with the average Vegas price point. When we left they provided us to-go cups for our drinks! Best to-go cup ever.   Second time I went was to kill some time before my flight left. My friend ordered an omelet and I ordered the tuna tartare. The tuna was great, but it had a bit too much chip to tuna ratio - lots and lots of chips, not much tuna. But what was there was really good. My friend was happy with his omelet.   Good price point, giant servings, and stiff drinks - it makes for a good stop.",

He was attentive and made sure we were comfortable. We live in Henderson and wished we could have something like this around us. It is worth coming to the strip!

After a long night of drinking, gambling, and having a great time, you get hungry. Typically, if this happens, you have to go to McDonald's. Gross. Instead, you get to go to this awesome 24 hour cafe that has pretty much the entire world on the menu. This is the one of the few places where the saying \"you can't always get what you want\", doesn't apply. I definitely appreciate that this Cheese Cake factory relative is at the Venetian/Palazzo and it was pretty much a staple of my vacation.  I'll mention that I had the wellness breakfast, and the avocado burger and was thrilled with both. The breakfast buffet didn't seem worth it to me unless you're going to eat all 3 meals in one sitting (but whatever! You totally can! You're in Vegas why not?)",

The hospitality from the host/hostesses all the way to the time you leave is everything you expect from a Las Vegas dining experience.  I am highlighting this because I value service most when I am out. The waiter who helped us had plenty to recommend and always had water in my cup.   I remember I was in the middle of a conversation and with a polite interjection he was able to get his message heard and I was able to resume my conversation with haste.   I had a chicken parmesan on a fresh ciabata roll with a mixed greens salad and a house vinagrette.  The Chicken parmesan was perfect from the crunch on the breading; to the Marinara. I am an Italian so I had to ask for more .   My friend had a simple yet delicious spicy chicken sandwich with the classic side of fries and Chipotle mayonnaise.  The food was fresh and timely brought to us to enjoy hot!!!  Happy hour specials are available from 4 to 630 with drinks and appetizers if you sit in the bar area.  Parking is free at the Venetian and you can't miss the place it's directly to your left after you head down to the casino floor from the parking garage .",

You get a lot of food for a reasonable amount of money.  We ordered burgers and sandwiches for dinner which came with fries and then we ordered a wide range of food for breakfast. My favorite things at the Grand Lux are either the cookies (which they bake fresh for 8.95 a dozen) or the lemon poppyseed pancakes! They are so tasty that they don't even require any toppings or syrup. They were sooooooo good. I wish I could have them every day for breakfast. If only I made that much money!",

So for all you early morning-ers, looking for food after the club or after a great long night of gambling, this is definitely the spot for you!   Grand Lux Cafe is The Cheesecake Factory's Little Brother. Same owners, so they have very similar concepts, menu items and drinky drinks. As soon as you walk in, it feels like you're walking into The Cheesecake Factory. Best thing about our visit, is that we're were seated within 5 minutes of just walking in. From the outside, it looks like a small seating area but once you walk into the back, the restaurant is huge! This is a great place for large dinner parties or that intimate date night.   My hubby and I have dined here before and have enjoyed it every time. For this past visit, here are the items we tried:  *Peach Bellini- blended and not too sweet. Great breakfast drink.   *Strawberry Sangria- this is too sweet; I wouldn't order this again.  *Sunday Night Pasta- pieces of short rib beef, with ground beef, mushrooms and onions in a thick red sauce over a bed of thin spaghetti noodles. Not your ordinary spaghetti. The sauce was a bit salty so I added Alfredo sauce to balance it out. After adding the Alfredo sauce and drops of Tabasco, this dish was pretty good.   *Chicken Royale- this dish comes with string beans, mashed potatoes and a ton of breaded pieces of boneless chicken. Peep the pictures, this dish was yummy!   Fast service for decent priced food. We'll always consider Grand Lux Cafe for our dining needs.",

We had about an hour and a half to eat and get back to the hotel for check-out, and this place had eggs on the menu (although it was the lunch menu).  It's owned by Cheesecake Factory, so if you want to know what to expect, then go to your local Cheesecake Factory and order your usual.  I found the eggs to be too greasy and J's sandwich was mediocre at best.  The waitress who took our order was impossible to track down, and we almost missed check-out because it took over 1/2 an hour to get our food (the table next to us ordered later and got their stuff on time).  I guess the place is okay, the service not so much, but with so many other options, why go to a more pricey version of Cheesecake Factory?",

    "text": "I've been traveling to LV with the same group of guys a couple times each year for the last 10 years or so. The last five we almost always stay at the Venetian and the Grand Lux Cafe has become our favorite place to eat.  Mind you, we in no way ignore all the great steak house near the strip or in downtown, but for some reason we love this place. On one 3-day trip, we ate their six times. One day, we ate every meal there!  What amkes this place so great? Its variety and the quality of the food. But there's a clincher for us. We always choose to dine in the patio area that overlooks the pathway between the casino and the elevators to the rooms and the stairways from the ballrooms because all the pretty gals in their evening dresses walk by past us. Good food, good friends and lovely ladies. What else could you ask for?!  Regarding the food, GLC makes great burgers, awesome pasta and delicious NY cheesecake. One of my friends loves the jambalaya and another likes the orange chicken. Breakfasts are good as well, and their salads are tasty and bountiful. The iced teas are enormous. They taste unlike any other iced tea I've had and at first I didn't like them, but they've grown on me.  The staff is always friendly and obviously have eaten all the dishes because they never lack for enthusiastic recommendations when we ask.  The portions are quite large, maybe not Claim Jumpers huge, but still big enough to illicit groans from some in our group that they need to go up to the room and lie down. It's also a good thing the restrooms are directly across from the the restaurant. If you need to make room for desert you can just hop the fence and be back right as it's being served.  If you ever stay at the Venetian give Grand Lux a try. Sometimes the lines are long, but they move pretty quickly. Sit in the patio, relax and enjoy the scenery.",

It's interesting when you step up to a hostess stand at 1:30AM and have to wait ten minutes for a table.  The Grand Lux is owned by the Cheesecake Factory, so if you're familiar with that style of food then the concepts are pretty similar.    The late night menu was trimmed down a bit, but they still had a good assortment of burgers, sandwiches, & finger foods, plus you could get breakfast dishes if you wanted them.  I just went for a grilled chicken sandwich and a beer, they were fine but our service was slow, and I didn't appreciate that the Grand Lux uses the same seating arrangements as the Cheesecake Factory where they'll seat you uncomfortably close to the next table.  This is especially annoying in Vegas, since the people sitting 18 inches away from us were totally wasted and loud.  If it's just you and one other person try to sit at the bar to avoid that and you'll probably have a better experience.",

They also have a $15 \"express breakfast\" which is really a small buffet with an Omelet station, fruit, oatmeal, muffins, pastries, breakfast meats and toast. Coffee and juice also included so a good value. Bad thing about it was the \"conventioneers\" who descended in masses and lined up for this breakfast so to get an omelet took forever. Coffee was great also, very rich and yummy! We did stop in at their bar one afternoon for a cocktail, I had one, okay two, Clementine Crush cocktails made with orange vodka and fresh juices, delish!! We've also been to the one in Chicago so knew what to expect and this one did not disappoint!",

One dish would be enough to share between two people.  The next time we came for lunch w my bf & his friend's, and the food was so-so. My bf & I decided to share the jambalaya dish with half shrimp half chicken and the dish was pretty bad. It was filled with bell peppers and did not have much of the jambalaya flavor. There was also not much sauce compared to most jambalaya dishes & it was pretty dry & just bad in general.

The Mendocino Salad was my favorite. The dates, goat cheese and the dressing was so good and To top it off they had cornbread chucks made it even more better. I am planning on going their again tonight just for the salad. Loved the salads.",

    "text": "4 stars for the ENORMOUS portions. I am so glad the waiter warned us about the portions prior to ordering because they are seriously massive, which was great for sharing and for the price. The dishes aren't too expensive less than $20 for a dish in Vegas. Grand Lux is located inside the Venetian and it reminded me a lot like Cheesecake Factory.   Some of my friends and I came in on a Saturday for lunch and there was no line. The ambiance is very ~dark and sultry~ seriously a replica of Cheesecake Factory's ambiance. They have a variety of pastas, burgers, pizzas. We had their pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza which was pretty big for $13 the pepperoni was a bit salty, but I thought it was really delicious. We also had their chicken marinara pasta with mozzarella super yummy after a night of drinking. They also have free bread which is great for a starter.   The customer service was great. They're very quick and helpful. I'd definitely come back when I'm in town and we're in need for something carby with large portions. :D",

The best part of this place is its location, especially if  you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo. You just walk down from your room and you're there.  They provide large portions and the food is actually very tasty.   They have a full bar.  What's great is if you have a comp, you can use it here too!  What's better than great tasting food?

I wasn't amazed by it, it could definitely be creamier and have a little more salt. For dinner, I ordered the garlic shrimp pasta, the portion size is big so i had enough for leftovers later. Claudia was so sweet to pack our food with silverware so we can eat it back upstairs at the hotel. They gave me a little ice cream bowl with a candle for my birthday, which didn't make me feel like i was turning 30 so i'm ok with that!",

The 4 star rating is due to the size of the buffet and location. It's inside a door way which was super confusing if you weren't sitting near it. In addition, it was a tad confusing because normally at buffets you pay before you enter, but this place seats you with a menu. The items in the buffet ranged from scrambled eggs, to the breakfast meats, various pastries, cereal, oatmeal and the fruit bar. It was kind of comparable selection wise to a holiday inn express. The quality of the food was very good. Only complaint is the eggs were a tad runny and the sliced ham was cold and on the dry side. It is 25 a head on the weekend, but does include your choice of juice.",

Service -They told us when we arrived that one person was taking our order and another would be taking care of us after, due to a shift change. The heads-up was good, but when the order came out wrong, the second server wasn't that helpful in fixing it. One of our friends ordered an egg white omelette and it came out made with eggs. He asked the waitress who said they could fix it, but it would take awhile. Shouldn't something they messed up be expedited?  Food -We all got eggs or an omelette. The omelettes were pretty large and not greasy. My husband and I got ours made with veggies, and it definitely came with a lot of fresh veggies. The home fries they were served with looked like they were frozen and heated. -Bread came in a basket for the whole table with butter and jam. It was toasted and pretty good. Nothing special, though. -Not really their fault due to when we arrived for our meal, but wish they served breakfast for longer.  Drinks -I just had water, but my husband and our friend each got a bloody mary. It was served with two pickled asparagus on top, which they both enjoyed a lot. They said they drink was a healthy amount of spicy!  Ambiance -This is one of those places right off the casino floor. I get that many people come to Vegas for this, but it's actually not an aspect I enjoy due to all of the cigarette smoke. We were seated on the perimeter of the restaurant, so quite close to the casino. The restaurant is all open to the casino, but perhaps requesting a seat a bit further to the interior of the restaurant would block this smell a bit?  This was pretty quick and easy, but given the amount of options in Vegas, not sure I'd run back.",

    "text": "We ate here two times and the food was delicious, timely and on point. We were looking forward to eating here as this place had a great reputation. I believe the food deserves 4 stars, no complaints about the food at all.  However, the service was quite a disappointment. One bartender in particular, a lady named Lina, was so rude to my dad because he did not have his ID on him as he ordered a beer at the bar. He is someone in his late 50's, and we simply could not believe her attitude and the backlash from her. He's a very reasonable guy and her rudeness and arrogance was disgraceful. She would not even give him time of the day to ask to go and get his ID from the room, although he clearly was above 21. I know there are rules and regulations for bar tenders in the US as I have lived here for almost 8 years, but her attitude was beyond arrogant and narcissistic. We did not eat there the third time, because of Lina. The rest of the staff was very apologetic on her behalf, but you do not give attitude to your customers when they're clearly over 21 and the CEO of global company that held a conference next door at the Venetian. She had the audacity to start explaining to my dad that they ID in bars \"all over the world\" which was just laughable because I do not believe this lady has even left the USA based on her arrogance and demeanor. Very disappointing. Safe to say, we will not be returning.",

Grand Lux Cafe has a great selection of food and everything is always done well.  The only negative I can say about this place is the floor can get oily and slippery.  I've never experienced that in any other restaurant but here. Depending on the hour of the day you come here, you can feel like you're sliding on grease.  Besides that, it's a great place to get good food at a decent price in Vegas.",

On my last visit to Vegas, we came here for a late brunch and were seated right away, despite how busy the place was. They have a pretty extensive weekend brunch menu and lunch menu so there's tons of options to choose from. I ended up getting the eggs any style and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage links with toast and hash browns. This was more than enough food and my tummy was very happy.   Service was quick and efficient. We were helped out by a couple different servers and they both always made sure we had enough water, coffee, and were both more than happy to give suggestions/recommendations.  If you find yourself roaming around The Venetian looking for a solid breakfast/brunch spot, Grand Lux Cafe is perfect. They are also open late night, so it's definitely an option when you're coming home from the clubs.",

This means we waited about half an hour for our food.  But we were hungry at 4am.   The burger my friend had boasted a patty that was an inch thick. At least. Another friend ordered a shrimp scampi with scarily large shrimp and my omelet had a 10-inch diameter...and we ate it all.  Delicious but the wait during such a crucial time of need resulted in the docking off of 2 stars. Oh and it's pretty expensive for drunk munchies.

We came here during dinner time though, not during the wee hours of the morning. And the place was fairly busy but since we had reservations we didn't have to wait very long.   The server was extremely friendly to us considering we had a big group (my family and I). She took our drink orders down and carded almost all of us minus the parentals. She even carded my oldest brother who is waaaay above the drinking age. I guess he just looks that young.   I ordered the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich. It came with french fries. It wasn't that bad actually. But it wasn't my favorite. It was pretty greasy but I guess most sandwiches with a name like that tends to be on the greasier side.  My brother ordered the Crispy Caramel Chicken and it was so so good. He let me try some and immediately I wanted to trade with him. It was so delicious. The sauce is sweet but not too sweet that it tastes like dessert. The chicken was crispy enough but not too much that it's hard to bite into. Oh man, I wish I had some right now!  The drinks were pretty strong and come in big glasses.   The service was awesome. Our server was so nice and friendly and joked with us. Very accommodating too!  We love coming to this place. So we'll definitely be back on our next trip!",

My wife went to register for the conference after waiting 15 minutes. I continued to wait for our food. 20 minutes later I asked the bar tender where our food was. He pulled the ticket and gave it a waitress. 10 minutes later I got fed up and left. As I was leaving the waitress stopped me to say it would only be a few more minutes. I'm 45 minutes into this ordeal, really? I gathered my things and as I walked out someone came with our order. I kept walking. Even if they comped the meal, I wouldn't have eaten it. I can't tell you about the food, because I haven't eaten it. I can tell you the service is about the worst I've ever encountered. It was relatively busy, but ever one around us was seated after us fed and left before we were even served. Total lack of customer service.",

They have a huge menu, just like the Cheesecake Factory, tons of stuff to order.   The other five (5) ordered these spicy bloody marys, man they tasted great. Hot and peppery, with pickled asparagus on top. After taking a taste of the g/f's (can't use her name) (actually don't know why I can't) I wished I had ordered one too. But I went with the old standby, ice tea, boring but thirst quenching.  Two in the party went for the breakfast sandwich, it was stuffed with ham,bacon,scrambled eggs, cheese on thick cut toasted bread. They devoured them like finger food. I had the Manhattan salad with shrimp and chicken. It looked better then it tasted. I'm not sure what it was missing but I wouldn't order it again.  Service was good, food was hot and fresh, and they refilled my ice tea several times without asking for it. That's always a plus for me, I love to get bloated on ice tea while I eat.",

    "text": "Cheesecake Factory is my favorite, or rather, the only chain that I like.  Grand Lux Cafe is the spitting image of its sister, from the wait to the menu to the quality of food and service.  I've also eaten at the one in Beverly Hills.  All consistent.  It was Christmas dinner time in Vegas, and we were headed to the one at the Palazzo, but we came across the one in the Venetian first, and since it was only a 20 minute wait (unheard of in Cheesecake Factory land) we stayed.  Our server was nice and we got apologies from both her and the manager for the long wait of our food.  Hell, I didn't care as long as I had my pomegranate martini ($13) to sip on, and some warm bread and butter to munch on.  I had the spaghettini w/ clams and rock shrimp.  Very garlicky and yummy.  I thought the pasta was a little on the dry side, until I got down to the bottom of my plate (yeah, it's a lot of pasta), where all the olive oil and white wine goodness had coagulated, probably from sitting under a lamp for awhile.  Anyways, it was good and I'd order it again. My petite friend ordered the \"max burger\" which had everything on it including bits of beef shortrib (are you serious?!).  She managed to eat half of it, said it was great, but suggested that seasoned and/or curly fries would have been a better partner than regular fries.  Someone else ordered the fried chicken which looked like it could have fed our whole table.  It was served with mashed potatoes, snap peas, broccoli, and sweet potatoes.  It must've been delish cuz she ate all her sides before getting to the chicken.  The least favorite meal at the table was the pasta carbonara.  Bland and made with cherry tomatoes, which she didn't like.  I took the little cherries and added them to my dry pasta which was actually a good pairing.    And just like the Cheesecake Factory, we didn't have room for the cheesecake or any other dessert.  That was my bad.",

My friends and I arrived here at about midnight and the place was still pretty packed. We were seated right away in a booth in the corner of their main dining room and it was perfect for us. Our server Javier was perfect in every way. He knew the menu and helped us along with our choices. He was always polite and made sure that everything was taken care of, he was very sociable and made us feel comfortable the whole night.  We ordered the Sunday Night Pasta, Chicken Pot Pie and I had the Chicken and Waffles. The pasta was OK, the pot pie was pretty standard and the Chicken and Waffles are not what you expect. It's actually boneless breaded chicken not your usual chicken wings. It was actually tender and juicy and flavorful. The waffles were absolutely perfect but the best thing was my Vanilla Honey Latte it is quite possible the best latte I've ever had!  One things for sure, I'll be back for some more!",

    "text": "This is my rant and is as accurate as possible.  Times are approximate.  What you are about to read is detailed.  You may want to turn away now especially if you absolutely love Grand Lux.  My friend Yin was set on going to the Grand Lux location at the Venetian.  We probably should've gone to a buffet instead.  A haggard server took our orders and pleasantly answered our questions.  She suggested a vinagerette on the side since I wasn't sure about whether I would like it or not.  Omelette and Hash Browns, two Pasta Carbonaras, Fried Chicken and Waffles (Boneless fried chicken and one Belgian Waffle - why it's plural on the menu is misleading) and Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya.  She even recommended lunch portions of our Carbonaras because they serve HUGE portions.  They switched servers to a perky young lady who seemed eager to take our order.  Sharida was her name, I believe, and she had curly hair.  She was taking over for the previous lady.  We were glad to have her.  After about 15 minutes, the first server surprisingly came back with the duck potstickers (delicious by the way) and a boat of my salad dressing.  In addition, a scalding hot loaf of sliced sourdough bread came a few minutes later.  Within this time, Grand Lux Cafe seats about six guys with luggages by their side to my right.  Soon thereafter, a family of five sits to my left.  15 minutes after getting our appetizers and bread...  The table of six guys gets their order of cold sandwiches and other quick-fix dishes.  \"Hmmm...\" we think to ourselves.  \"They get their order before us but they sat later.  At least we got our potstickers and bread to tide us over.  Besides, it probably takes quicker to fix their lunch than ours does.  What am I going to do with this salad dressing without salad though?\"  They take our appetizer plate and small dishes away.    20-minute mark from the time they delivered our appetizers...  25-minute mark...  The family to my left gets their orders.  I noticed some had fried chicken, others pasta, still others, hot and tasty dishes.  Okay, something was seriously wrong.  30-minute mark..  35-minute mark..  I try to flag down our waitress who went from one of the bar tables and goes to six-guy table to my right and asks if everything came out alright.  I try to catch her attention through her peripheral vision, but she clearly makes her way to the kitchen.    40-minute mark..  My cousin gets up and seeks out our waitress.  He follows her, calls out, but according to him she ignored him and bolted for the kitchen.  The two ladies at the end of the bar simply tell him, \"You don't look so happy.\"  \"I'm not,\" he says, but with a smile because they're girls.  He was hiding his frustration.  He sits back down with us.  45 minutes after getting our appetizers...  All of us are so hungry and waiting there.  I lost my appetite.  Our drinks aren't even filled.  My cousin says, \"Let's get out of here.\"  I on the other hand didn't want to leave without at least paying for the potstickers.  \"Let's just leave,\" he repeats standing up.  \"I don't need this.  We should just go somewhere else.  Clearly the other tables got their food and we didn't.\"  He pointed out the bar area also got their food right away.  I was beginning to suspect a number of different factors as to why we didn't get ours, but I had enough of it too.  I stood up too looking around for any server.  Yin makes her way to the hostess to try and flag a manager.  My brother stands up. Our table is empty.  Just as the last of our friends agrees and stands up ready to leave, several food servers come out with our dishes.  The cheese on our carbonara was dried and hard from the prolonged heat.  The fried chicken wasn't fresh.  The waffle was on the verge of being burnt.  The omelette looked rubbery.  In spite of it all, I liked my creamy pasta and I think the bacon saved it.  I just had to move the cheese.  I was so upset I only ate half of it and didn't enjoy it as much as I could've had it been fresher earlier.  You can *definitely* tell all of our food had been sitting out for a while.  Salad greens were wilted and had dark spots and tomatoes were mushy.  The manager, Marty, kept asking how she could make it up to us...crap 5000 word limit-  We understand restaurants tend to get busy especially during Sunday mornings and afternoons in Vegas, but clearly, there was some miscommunication between servers and the kitchen.  Maybe it was Sharida's first day.  There are legitimate reasons as to why service (albeit friendly) was abhorrent.  Our server could've at LEAST periodically come by with a status.  I've never ever come across service like this.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I'd go back to Grand Lux Cafe out of mercy, but never will I set foot at this location again.    We had as much fun on our dining experience as you had reading my rant.",

    "text": "A miniature version of cheesecake factory. Kinda like cheesecake   factory's little brother.. Located inside the palazzo.  I'm not making that up, it really is from  the creators of cheesecake factory.  In fact, I ended up liking this place better than CF. times ten.  Has a wide range of entrees to choose from but not as much as big   bro.  They have some things that are similar, like some of the main   dishes, salads and desserts. But what cheesecake factory DOES NOT have are CHEESESTEAK ROLLS.  What it is.. Philly cheesesteak with cheese and mushrooms rolled in to a little, yummy appetizer. Crispy outside.. And warm philly cheesesteak inside.. but bitesized. (kinda like an egg roll..but not.. it's better.)   I had to rave about it because I liked it so much. They also have comp bread n butta which was pretty good.  not the same bread as cf's.. equally as good as my favorite molasses bread.  I ordered the chicken with sun dried tomatoes & mozzarella pasta and added  grilled shrimp to it.  It was screwdriver shaped pasta with creamy sauce, full of flavor.  I liked it!  Really really big dish, I ate alot and still had plenty of leftovers.  people in my party ordered salmon dishes.. one miso salmon dish (which tasted good, better than CF's) and one called \"salmon 3 ways\"  (which had 3 different flavors of salmon).. another ordered the combo of ribeye and shrimp scampi w. mashed potatoes.  A big plus is that it's open 24 hours! Well, it IS vegas.  soo coming back to try the late night menu next time i'm there.",

It's open 24 hours which is the perfect place to go that's close by and on the strip after a fun night of clubbing. Everyone seemed to have the same idea as us and we must've waited half an hour for a table. We had a larger group though - of like 8 people. When we finally sat, I was already regretting picking food over sleep. When in doubt pick sleep always - just a tip. Haha. Anyways I wanted something light to settle my alcohol ridden stomach so I ended up getting the Zen noodles. Worse thing to get. Wow, I was hoping for halfway decent noodles but these were dreadful. The broth was thin and too lemongrass-y. The noodles were short and rough and the texture was almost too al dente. They put chicken in there and it's a bit rough and overcooked. At least they had the soy bean sprouts and lime and cilantro and all the other herbs on the side for me to add. I would day that was the most authentic part of my dish. And so overpriced at like $13. Crazy. I left unsatisfied and looking forward to just crashing. Other dishes looked ok like the flatbread pizza, sandwiches and breakfast. Yeah I just caution ordering such an Asian dish at such an American place.",

Normally I wouldn't goto Grand Lux with so many other options in Vegas but I wanted to try something new and the situation at the time didn't allow for anywhere else.  Service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  Although the restaurant is open 24 hrs, they aren't very flexible about fulfilling requests.  Tried to order a house salad but they said they couldn't meet the request.  Not a big deal, but it was late in the morning you would think they could throw some lettuce in a bowl especially for a restaurant that's open 24 hrs.  Like I said, not a big deal since they aren't a diner.  Ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  Portions are huge just like the Cheesecake Factory.  It was good, nothing outstanding however.  Prices aren't outrageous, besides the typical Strip markup.  All in all an OK experience.  I wouldn't eat here again unless it's 4AM but that's only because there are so many other dining options in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ah, the Venetian!  Though I can't afford it very often(...er, often... eh...ever...), the Venetian is undoubtedly my favorite hotel on the Strip (which probably contributes to my fondness of Grand Lux)!  On this trip, we caught a late dinner here post-Blue Man Group...  Location-wise, the \"patio'd\" dining area of Grand Lux has a great view for people watching, looking out upon the escalator landing that meets the casino floor to the parking structure and shopping center.  And the people watching here is excellent... the sexy, the desperate, the suave, the chic, the buffoonery!  The interior/exterior is inline with the vibe and feel of the Venetian, simple-chic , with notable designerly touches of old-country influence and theme .    Grand Lux is by no means a fancy-shmancy bistro.  It is, in essence and actuality, a well-dressed upscale Cheesecake Factory affiliated establishment.  And for the intent and perspective of casual ambiance, generous portions, affordable dining, it's well suited...  The puree'd Butternut Squash and ginger soup was a great start to the late night meal; delicately sweet with a subtle tartness.  Only one person had ordered it, but it was so good, she insisted on passing it around amongst the five of us.  It was that good...  I had the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich;  sharable serving of four triangular flatbread sandwiches set atop a platter of fries.  A smokey-spiciness from the chicken and the pepperjack cheese is offset by a cool avocado-corn salsa.  I ate half and saved the other have for breakfast.  Also around the table was the chili-cheese topped jumbo Kobe Hotdog (w/fries), the Braised Pot Roast dinner, and the Chicken Royale (w/ white wine butter sauce)... everything tasted good (the cool thing about foodies, if they've got something good, they like to share!)   Our bill for the food (sans drinks)?  Just north of $60.  It's one of the better (if not one of the best!) casual after-midnight menus on the strip... with the bonus of watching an entertaining  parade of people.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise. It was really really good.  Ok. This Grand Lux Cafe is located on the casino level of the Palazzo. It is open 24 hours, so I didn't really think it was going to be THAT great. After fumbling around the casino with our stomach lining stuck to the spine, we decided we will settle for this place, not knowing what kind of surprise we were in for.  We ordered Caprese Salad, and I ordered Chicken Parmasan. (I forgot what my guy ordered. uh oh =P) The caprese salad was probably one of my favorite caprese salads I've had in a while. Instead of getting a neatly cut tomatos and cheese, we were greeted with a bed of lettuce and chopped tomatos, smothered in cheese and excellent dressing. Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Then the chicken parmasan. When I was ordering this dish, the server asked if I wanted the dinner size or lunch size. I ordered the lunch size, bit worried if I ordered enough food, but then this humongous chicken came out on top of spaghettini lighly tossed with tomato sauce. Oh man, it was probably one of the best I've had, but since it was so huge, I could only eat half of it. I wonder what the dinner size would look like, but I am sure it could be able to feed 2.   We came back home to LA after a lovely stay at the Palazzo. When we were passing by Beverly Center, then that is when we realized that they have another Grand Lux Cafe on the 1st floor of Beverly Center. Oh man, we are glad to know that we can get their food right at home. (Assuming they serve the same stuff)",

The first night I ordered the \"Shaking Beef\" and my late night meal was chicken & waffles.  The shaking beef was pretty good. Nice chunks of beef, red onions, green onions, and white rice. Definitely liked the kick it had to it. The chicken and waffles were ok. Nothing spectacular but it fulfilled my late night craving!  Next time I club it up at TAO or Lavo I will definitely return. I don't know if I would consider it a \"go to\" spot for me but it's cool. If you're on a budget this is a great place to dine because there are MANY options under 20$ Not bad for Las Vegas!",

I got the 7 mushroom burger and I have to say that it was very good. The problem I was having was that it was so damn big! I honestly didn't know how to start eating it and tried numerous methods and eventually I gave up and tried with my hands. It worked, but I made a huge mess in the process. The mushrooms were sliding left and right, and everything was just falling off. It tasted really good; the different mushrooms added lots of flavor. I finished it, but it was so much work to eat a burger.   Come and try this place out! The staff is friendly and alert, and the food is very good. Just keep in mind that if you order the burger I did, you'll have to put in some real work to eat it!",

I asked for asparagus, mushrooms and tomatoes as an add on for my egg and hash breakfast, and I got a large portion of each. I was charged the price of a veggie omelette, which was nice. The service was friendly and really fast in comparison to the Bouchon.  While the Grand Lux has better bang for the buck, and the veggie omelette and selection were better, I would say the Bouchon has much better bread.",

The first time I came here was for second dinner after the first dinner had ended in much disappointment (some cafe at the Wynn before watching a show, ugh, never again). I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad and the portion of the salad was so large, I couldn't finish it (I eat a lot). Service is also friendly and attentive. Ordered another salad the second time I came back but it wasn't as good as the ahi tuna salad. The bread that you start off with though is excellent. I can eat the wheat one for days.   Anyway, it's my to-go spot for late night eating in Vegas (: I would say it's way better than Cheesecake factory.",

It's simple American food with the traditional selections of hamburgers, sandwiches, and pastas that you would get at any other American restaurant. I stayed at the Palazzo with friends once on a trip and we literally ate here for every meal for three days. The reason why this is possible is because they have a HUGE menu. Two of my favorites are the chicken flautas and their corned beef hash.   Grand Luxe is a sister restaurant of the cheesecake factory so their food is pretty similar in taste and style. One star off though because they don't have the brown break like cheesecake factory and thats always a disappointment for me whenever I go :(",

I love it because I actually order my pizzas cheese-less (please don't hate). The balsamic dressing that came with my salad was delicious. My pizza was perfect!  We were definitely well taken care of here and we both enjoyed ourselves.  I paid about $15 for my lunch, this is definitely not bad considering it's Vegas and everything is usually expensive. The atmosphere was really great too. It is a great place to come to after spending hours traveling to Vegas.  If you want a cute, relaxing place to have a meal whether with friends or a significant other, I definitely recommend it. It won't burn a whole in your pocket and you'll leave feeling satisfied.

Our server took forever to get us our food (despite the fact that it was 2am and the tables were mostly empty... he could have at least come to us to apologize), he didn't once stop by to check on how our meal was going, and we sat there for 15 or 20 minutes with empty plates before he brought our check.  In fact, he only brought the check because my boyfriend yelled and got his attention.  THEN, it took a while for him to bring us the check and return credit cards.  We were all pretty irritated.  VARIETY: 5/5.  Lots of late-night options, which we appreciated.  Everything from burgers to omelets to desserts.  FLAVOR: 4/5.  Pretty good.  I enjoyed my winter vegetable soup, the beignets were deliciously fluffy (though I thought the sauces were unnaturally sugary and preservative-laden), and the burger was flavorful and well-cooked.  VALUE: 4/5.  Considering it's Vegas, not too bad.  My soup was around $5, burger around $13.  It's a good thing I waited 2 days to cool off before writing this review... I had originally been considering giving it 1 star!  But in retrospect, the food really was pretty good.  So if you're ready to face the prospect of unapologetically slow service, I'd recommend coming here.",

I've had breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late dinner here before, and I don't think anything has ever failed my taste buds. I notably remember the Shaky Beef with rice plate (which is Vietnamese Com Bo Luc Lac) and it was simply amazing, better than most Vietnamese restaurants I've been to (and I'm Vietnamese)! It was a steep price though, 20 bucks. But worth the splurge. When you're in Vegas, you just wanna spend money like there's no tomorrow anyway.  Also, if you just want something on-the-go for that quick meal before you go out drinking, their sandwiches in the cafe are all bomb. I always devour those without hesitation.",

I love me some eggs benedict, but the menu here doesn't offer many different types as other restaurants do and only had regular eggs benedict with ham.  I hate ham, so I asked the waitress to substitute it for bacon, which she said would not be a problem.  Obviously, there was a problem, because when we got our meals, there was no bacon to be found, but tons of ham.  I was starving so I just sucked it up and ate it.  It was soggy and gleaming with oil.  Beyond unappetizing.   I always found this place to be overrated and this trip proved it to me once again!",

    "text": "Disgusting food, terrible service, dismissive management.  Group was seated at 11:30 and greeted by our server about ten minutes afterward.  We were able to put in our order by 11:55, but the food did not arrive until 1:20.  Our table was not served bread.  We had to flag the server down for drink and water refills.  We watched entire tables of people sit down, order, eat, and leave in time while we were waiting for our food.  Our server repeatedly assured us that the food would be served soon, and a manager named Lisa even came by (after about an hour) to tell us that our orders would be up soon.  When the food finally did come, it was cold, had clearly been sitting, and was damn near inedible.  I had Zen Noodles - described as pho on the menu, but in reality it was canned chicken broth (cold by the time it was served) poured over a clump of rice noodles with sliced chicken.  I was so disappointed - no seasoning, no flavor...just a lot of bland, cold, blech.  No one else in my group even came close to finishing or even enjoying their meal.  The \"extensive menu\" is full of previously frozen/processed/reconstituted crap.  The food was below Denny's in terms of quality or tastiness.    I think the icing on the cake was when we let our server know that we'd like the check.  20 minutes later, she delivers the check.  One in our group was leaving from the restaurant to the airport for her 3:30pm flight, so she asked if she could close out first.  The server said yes, grabbed the check, and we watched her go EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE POS TO CLOSE OUT THE CHECK...checking on other customers, talking to another server...it was almost like she was wandering around looking for something else to do just so that my friend would miss her plane.  When we asked the manager, Lisa, for help, she walked away from me and told me that they were really busy and the server would take care it when she could.  Would never come back.  Hope this tourist trap hellhole gets converted into a roller skating rink or a dog salon or something useful.",

The complimentary bread is a light sourdough with a wonderful, crisp crust.  In general the prices here are extremely modest considering the fact that it's in Las Vegas.

The shrimp is breaded (?!) and served in a cream sauce, not butter. The parmesan crusted pork chop was the tastiest of the dishes, but side vegetables were limp and lukewarm. I'd also mention the gin and tonic was weak, but watered down cocktails are a Vegas tradition. The restaurant is more than usually noisy. This can be helped slightly by requesting not to sit near the open kitchen. Our wait staff (more than one server per table) were friendly and attentive. Since this is open 24 hours, I'm sure there is a convenience associated with the higher ratings - when you're a bit tipsy and everything else is closed, you don't care much about quality at 2am. If you're looking for a nice evening of semi-casual dining, however, there are other options.",

We were kind of disappointed that most of the menu wasn't available that time of night. We were really craving an entree, but had to settle on sandwiches instead. We ordered some ahi tuna to start.  The tuna was ok, nothing spectacular or anything. It was served with carrots, bean sprouts, and cucumbers. There was no soy sauce or wasabi served with the dish. Instead, the plate had a line of what appeared to be some kind of creamy horseradish.  I ordered a BLT and it was tasty. Nothing really to write home about, but then again it's a BLT, kind of hard to screw up.  Our server was very friendly and attentive considering the time of day. I would probably pass if I had to eat here again, but if you want a bite to eat during odd hours, it's one of the few places open where you can sit down and have a bite.",

It's a 24 hour restaurant and is a branch of Cheesecake Factory. I think they also had an AYCE breakfast buffet for $20, but I went with the lunch special of a soup-sandwich-salad combo instead. There was barely a wait. The food was pretty tasty, but I still need to try more dishes in order to really judge the food. Everything came out to be around $14 with tax/tip, which I think is pretty cheap in Vegas.   I'd definitely come back here for the decent price and food!",

Finally went my last time I was in Vegas.    was not quite as epic as everyone made it out to be but I enjoyed the food either way, definitely better than alot of spots on the strip.   Got a short rib grilled cheese, which if you have never tasted the combination of juicy meaty, grilled short rib and grilled cheese than I suggest you do so.  This is still a good example of this love affair but Los Angeles has several establishments where they serve a better one, Grand Lux's was slighly dry.  Nonetheless, it definitely hit the spot. :D  Also ordered the Asian nachos, which was my FAVORITE thing of the evening.  Made like regular nachos but with an Asian twist, and with Won Ton strips instead of tortilla chips which I feel is one of the more unique and impressive dishes I have came across in some time.    Their grand Lux burger was also good but not everything my friends ordered came out as spectacular as say the Asian nachos.  Would definitely come back here if near here while im in Vegas.",

My husband ordered a meaty pasta dish that  DID NOT look so appetizing (looks like someone diarrhea'd all over a plate of noodles) but if you could get past the looks of it, it was actually pretty good. They should definitely serve it premixed.   I had ordered a Caesar salad to go with my food, but the waitress forgot to write it down and accused me of not ordering it...although everyone else at my table heard it. It was a lot of food, so I didnt mind so much...except the accusation.  Overall it was a good place to eat for nothing special.

We were seated quickly. Our server was very friendly.  Since we weren't starving, we decided to split a pizza. We ordered the Sausage, Pepperoni & Mushroom pizza off of the late night menu. The food did take a little while to get to the table. The pizza reminded me of &pizza's pizza because of the shape of the pizza. Pizza was good, a tad bit salty but still good.

    "text": "Heard that the breakfast buffet or express buffet was amazing so decided to check it out.  We arrived just after 7am, it was not busy and there was no wait.  You can tell it's a Cheesecake Factory concept, uncomfortably close seating next to everyone.  Everyone's in your business and there is no privacy.  We asked for orange juice and coffee.  Then we went into the buffet room, I heard that the selection was small, quality over quantity.  I was surprised how small the selection was, one side of room were 3 hot dishes, one with hash browns, one with sausage, bacon & ham, and one with scrambled eggs, I noticed 3 more hot plates on the other side of the room, I hoped they contained grilled tomatoes, mushrooms or maybe something interesting, but sadly no, just a mirror image of what I already had.  There was an omelette station, chef couldn't even cook over medium eggs correctly, one was with hard yolk and one was undercooked with snotty whites. Fruit selection was nice all ripe, pastries were nice too. Service was slack, never got a coffee refill and had to ask for a juice refill and then wait several minutes for it.  Lots of people looking around for refills.  Had to stack dirty plates on the empty table next to me cause nobody was clearing.   Not overly impressed with this place.  Need a few more hot items for selection and more attentive service.  I noticed the section next to us has a female server who was on the ball, even getting coffee to go for her guests.",

Easy for guests of The Venetian to access and to sign overpriced food tabs to their rooms.  With coffee at $4.50 a cup and orange juice $6.50 a glass their Express Breakfast Buffett is their best deal. Their Buffett Omelette station is the usual. Nothing special added.   We ordered off the menu this morning. I couldn't stomach their Florentine Omelette. They cover it with Hollandaise sauce which I like but them broil it onto the top of this salty mess of an egg dish.   We also ordered their Huevos  Rancheros. I love Huevos Rancheros. Their version was the worst I've ever tasted. The ranchero sauce they ladle around it is a disgustingly sweet slop.  Too many other great options for breakfast in Las Vegas to ever go back.",

I kind of prefer music or the conversation with others at the table, or myself if I'm eating alone I'm just that interesting to talk to.   I wouldn't  normally start with a criticism for a place where I had a good meal but that really stood out, sure a food court should have a noise level of a crowd at a heavy metal concert but the Gand Lux is a nice place. Not that it hurts the place it was crowed and the food was good and well priced. I would recommend it, just maybe go for a table in the back.",

    "text": "I got to the restaurant and there was no one there waiting. No one around in the waiting area period. Not busy at all. My best friend went up to the counter to get us a table. I was with my 2 yr old and my younger siblings(five total). We stood there waiting as people suddenly started to show up, so some people that only had 2 or 3 people got sat first, understandable. I hear this guy walk up to the counter and ask how long to seat six? However, I didn't pay no mind to listening to the response. Anyway, that fact is relevant to what I'm getting to next. As we wait a little longer, I ask my friend how long the wait is. He told me, about five minutes from the time we got there. It's fine that we had to wait a little longer than five minutes, but then, , the host seats the table with six first! I'm like, ok, maybe they sat them down at a table with six chairs. Idk? (giving her the benefit of the doubt) Nope! She sat us right next to them in the same size booth like table. That is NOT ok with me! I got there when no one else was there and you seat me after a party that showed up after me? For what reason? It wasn't because we had different servers. We had the same server.  This was around five in the evening so whoever the two girls were, working in the front, great job on customer service!  I was facing the host when I heard my friend's name, as the two girls conversed, so I thought she was calling us, but that's when she called the party of six instead. I'm pretty sure the other girl was letting her know we were first but I don't think she cared.  Either way. That's just rude. Aside from the host with the most, careless attitude , lol,   I ordered the miso glazed halibut. It was not very good. I couldn't tell whether I was smelling or tasting the fish. It was gamey,  and it tasted kind of slimy with not much of a miso glaze or taste. I asked my best friend to taste it, (he's a sushi chef), he said it didn't taste right and the texture was rubbery. Our waitress, Shanene,  apologized and some other guy did as well. He didn't introduce himself, but he came to my table and took my order. I think he might have been the manager? He was super nice and so was our waitress. The food is just ok. I give them three stars to be fair. It's not a bad place or bad environment, however, the first person to come in contact with us did not make a good lasting impression. I'm good on this place. We still gave a 22% tip regardless. I want nothing out of this, as I won't be back anyway. I just want to state that what the host did is not ok.",

I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner before. Each time I leave with a happy stomach and money left in my pocket. There's a lot of variety on the menu. I enjoy having the omelettes during breakfast and the average price is around $13. Some fast food places at the food court charge more than that. Lunch averages around $20 and dinner is around $30.   The other day I tried out the Caramel Chicken and it was delicious. The chicken had a nice crisp to it and the sauce went really well with the white rice. In my opinion, almost everything on the menu is acceptable. The burgers are good. The omelettes in the morning are tasty. I always have trouble ordering because everything sounds tasty. You seriously can't go wrong with the Grand Lux.   To top of the good food is the friendly services. The servers are always attentive and efficient when it comes to customer service. Like I said, I've been here at least 4 times now and I've never left disappointed.",

It took quite awhile for them to get the check but it was pretty busy. Another note is there are no restrooms inside the restaurant. You would have to go outside to the casino's restroom. Also, be careful if you're wearing heels.  The floors were quite slippery.",

Very well cooked meals, didn't have to send anything back at all. As well all you can eat bread so I was a happy raver. We were just staying at The Palazzo so probably about a couple minute walk from the lobby and you're there! They also have a cafe side in case you're looking for something quick and easy. Definitely try their desserts, you won't be disappointed!",

I've eaten here when i'm sober as well as drunk. I would not recommend getting the sliders ( Even though my bestfriend Magic Mark insists on ordering it everytime ).. they're a little bland for my taste.  Do try the chicken alfredo and pasta carbonara. It's decent and flavorful. I like to ask for some extra sauce for the chicken alfredo on the side.  If the line is long, hit the take out line, it's usually much faster. Grand Lux gets pretty busy later in the day",

She asked us how many for the second time, we said two, she smiled and made eye contact with another employee who started walking her way. This couple who was behind us was then asked by her how many, they said two and she said \"ok come with me\"... What the heck? And sits them on an \"outside\" . The second coworker makes it to us 2 mins after and puts us in between two other couples. Tight and awkward. Like in previous posts, although not busy everything took long.  I was already a bit irritated about the hostess situation and waiting 10 mins for bread and water that we decided just to share a waffle since we had heard great things and eat dinner elsewhere.  4/5 Food Bread was terrible. More like toast. Super hard and very crumby. Not hot or even warm. Waffle oj the other hand though was perfect. Crispy, fluffy and full of flavor!! So so good. A must try.  There is no check back with your food. We had 3 waiters in the 45 min time frame we where there. No refills either on water. Bill was quick to come out.",

We were seated in a nice comfortable booth and ordered a Pina Colada and Buffalo Chicken Wings. Loved the classy ambiance. Service is commendable.  Within a few minutes our drink was served. My husband who normally doesn't take alcohol actually loved the Pina Colada here. Chicken wings were amazing too! Loved it so much that we brought our parents to the restaurant the next day for lunch!  Tip: The entree portions are pretty big, unless your stomach is rumbling, 2 people can easily share one entree and leave the restaurant on a full stomach.",

When we got there, there was no line so we headed straight up to the hostess. She seated us immediately.   Our waitress have us bread to snack on after she got our waters.  I ordered the Fresh Garden Omelette. It has mushrooms, tomato, avocado, green onion, zucchini, fresh spinach, Harvati cheese & sour cream. It came with a side of hash browns.  The omelette was HUGE!

Waited 5 mins to be seated though. 10 minutes in, that's when the crowd was dying down.  Waiter looked like he hated his job by the way he took our drink orders. Took him 15 minutes to bring out our water as well.  The table next to us had lots of complaints but I would rather want their server than ours to be honest. He was so attentive to their needs.  I order the pasta carbonara ( $17 )  Husband ordered the tomato loving pasta w/ grilled chicken ( $19 ) My pasta was so bland, omg. I had to add salt and it still did nothing. I wasn't expecting it to be so dry because according to the Yelp pictures, everyone raved about it.  My husbands pasta was honestly a lot better than mine. Although his chicken was drier than the heat in Vegas. He could've lived without the chicken. His has so much flavors going on. I usually like white sauce and he loves his red sauce. But man did I regret my order. Our server didn't even bring out our food nor did he check up on us. Terrible service from him. Most definitely not coming back there.  2 stars for my untastful carbonara and not so great service.",

First off, the portions are HUGE. We were warned by the server, but I didn't think it'd be that big. We ordered 3 pastas and 2 appetizers for five people. We only finished one appetizer...  For starters, we had the calamari and Thai crispy rolls. The breading didn't stick to the calamari, which just made it okay. I thought the Thai crispy rolls were just alright also, but my friends really liked it. The crispy rolls were the only thing we finished.  We all agreed that the best item we ordered was the Garlic Shrimp pasta. I like this dish because it wasn't too heavy for pasta. The pasta with Grilled Chicken, Sun Dried-Tomatoes, and Mushrooms was pretty good also. I didn't really enjoy the Pasta Carbonara because I don't like bacon and it kind of overpowered the dish.  The service was really good. It was the best service we had in Vegas. Our server was really friendly and attentive. I wish I had her name so I could give her some recognition.  I wanted to give this place four stars, but it's just not a four star restaurant to me. I don't know how to explain it... I would probably come back to this place because it's affordable to eat in Vegas. It's also open 24 hours so I'd pick this place to eat when I'm drunk too.",

    "text": "After a night out at Tao, my party split. Some were too drunk to continue the night, while others (including myself) held it together and carried on! I had the pleasure of staying at The Venetian, so we thought... Why go out to The Strip where it's incredibly hot? So we started looking...   I'm not a big fan of going to sit-down places in Vegas; I really don't see the point. But the food court only had two places open - none of which seemed appealing. Luckily, a worker of the Venetian walked by us, so I (probably drunkly) walked up to her and asked if there were any other places that we could eat. She was really nice, pointed at Grand Lux, and said, \"It's REALLY good.\" I was sold.   We walk in (party of four) and are immediately seated. Our server is VERY nice and attentive - and please keep in mind this was around 3 am - so I really doubt he wanted to be there. I forgot his name, but the guy was awesome.   Onto food: We ordered the BLT sandwich, someone else ordered a burger, and per the servers recommendation, someone ordered Asian nachos (AMAZING, btw). I ordered the Bacon-Cheese burger(!!!!!).   The Asian nachos were freaking amazing... They're made with crispy friend wontons, covered with chicken, sweet peanut sauce, and wasabi cream and melted cheese! The plate comes with about ten of them, and we were all able to get one and enjoy it. It's just crispy goodness! Very yummy.   My Bacon-Cheese burger was freaking good. I just reviewed GR's BurGR, and I was really unimpressed with the service and food. My burger was a disappointment. Luckily, I had come to the GLC the night before, so this burger was still on my mind. I ordered it well done, and it was made perfectly. It's ANGUS beef with crispy bacon, melted American cheese, grilled onions, and mayo. I really recommend it! I was starving, and yet, I couldn't even finish it. It was huge! The fries that it came with were meh, but nothing a little ranch can't fix.   Overall, I can recommend this place for lunch or at least for the Asian nachos and burger that I ordered. The service was GREAT, but the time it took to get our food was a bit long... No matter. He kept checking on us, and made sure that our drinks were filled. That alone is good enough for me.",

My friend and I were seated immediately upon entering, and we got straight to ordering. I ordered a chocolate espresso martini to start followed by the asian nachos as an app and the chicken and waffles for my entree. My friend went with the chicken parm. Our server was really nice, and made sure coffee/ water was always full.  If you like vodka, I would recommend trying their martini- that thing was strong! I switched to coffee and poured it in about halfway through. Asian nachos were great- fried wontons with rice, cheese, chicken, and two different yummy sauces on them. Entrees arrived soon after, and oh man, they were huge! There were probably 6 chicken strips on my waffle and my friend's chicken parm was easily the size of his 14 inch oval platter. Both meals were well rec'd- I took home the majority of my food (thank goodness for mini-fridges!). My friend said this was his favorite meal of our entire trip. So yes, more expensive version of The Cheesecake factory. So what's wrong with that? Absolutely nothing :)",

Maybe it's because I'm used too excellence when dining here, but they just don't seem like what they used to be.  The wait time was much longer than what I was told and there were forgotten items and modifications made to my meal.  On top of that, a plate that I always order here was not served to it's potential.  The chicken that night tasted absolutely plain.  It's going to be a while before my next Grand Lux meal",

The menu is very big, and some of the dishes are 3 stars, but some are 4.  The burgers are great, the big salads are very good. Avoid the Italian food and I wouldn't order the steak. But if you want a Cobb salad, a burger, chicken sandwich this is a good place to grab one for 15-20 out the door with a drink.",

I finally had to call over another person to take our order.  She was very apologetic, he probably returned about 20-25 minutes later...hummm  This would account for the 4 star rating and not a 5. One thing about the Grand Lux, is that the portions are HUGE!!  We had cheeseburgers and as always they were terrific!! Will definitely go back the next time we are in Las Vegas..",

Also, the manager Matt came around to make sure that everything was to our liking. I love Grand Lux and will be dining there a lot more often. Thank you Chuy for taking care of us that night!",

We at their three times as it was right around the corner from the elevators, but I'm glad we did. I ordered huevos rancheros first and they were dynamite. A BBQ chicken flatbread second...equally dynamite.   The creme de la creme was the chicken & waffles. Perfectly cooked chicken, a thick Belgian, chopped pecans, a maple butter sauce makes for a plate full of awesome! This was so great that the redneck next to us actually stopped talking on his cell phone to comment how wonderful it looked. I was actually full halfway through, but I just couldn't stop eating it. Could. Not. Stop!   I loved this place and am really looking forward to having it again very soon!",

The Grand Lux is a good choice when you're trying to eat a good meal at a good price, but don't want to be all cheap and McD's about it. The prices are fair for the portions and quality of the food.   The service was off in one instance where everyone got their food except me because of a kitchen error (I think my plate was sent to a different table). However, I'm not bitter because the server was straight up about it and very apologetic. He vowed to get me my grilled cheese right away and even offered a side to hold me over. When I said I didn't need a side, he insisted, so I went with french fries and he brought me the a huge bowl of fries. I'm talking 2 or 3 times a normal meal portion. Not necessary, but I appreciated the gesture.   Oh, and I definitely appreciated that grilled cheese!",

The rice came out burnt and chewy and after sending it back the server came back with it but the with the same rice but just a larger portion. She then asked if he wanted more black beans. Why?!? Why can't the chefs just remake the freaking rice right? How hard is it? RUBIOS makes better Spanish rice and you guys are suppose to be competing with all the other restaurants but can't make rice right? Anyway, I got the Salisbury steak and it was chewy and the crust on the outside was hard. My coworker said there breakfast is good but we'll never know because we're never coming back.",

I really thought perhaps this was a mirage (at 4am in Vegas), but alas...it was the Venetian (womp womp).  The food was truly out of this world!!  I want to write an ode to the salted caramel syrup my cousin had with her chicken and waffles.  I mean, like in Gaelic. Hardcore.  We took some to go, and drank it for \"breakfast\" the next day.  I had the Zen Noodles and all I can tell you is, it's some of the best \"pho\" I've had in awhile!   The lemongrass broth beats plain ol chicken or beef or veggie any day!  You can add the veggies (sprouts, basil, lime) and request the Sriracha (although it was in paste form, and I prefer the chili pepper sauce).  The noodles are big and flat, and I like how they bring you extra broth in a small carafe - aye! que cute!  My bestie had the chicken parm, and I'm telling you, the portions DON'T PLAY.  If we had been in the same moods, and not so tipsy, I would have shared.  As it were, we had parm the next day for lunch - BOTH of us.    I see there are nothing but 4's and 5's down the line for this place, so believe them!  TIP:  Um, don't go SO drunk you can't enjoy it....and they're open all night (one of the few!)  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.venetian.com%2Fgrand-lux-cafe-venetian.html&s=44444a877444169fb40e8301c574edfdace452d92df9670a1d3ad45253682ca0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">venetian.com/grand-lux-c...</a>",

We were seated within 5 minutes and then we waited a while for our waiter. Finally, we ordered, and I got the tomato soup expecting a nice simple red soup with maybe some basil. I was extremely disappointed when the tomato soup came out a while later with beans and onions and the flavor was spicy. The soup was chunky and nothing like a tomato soup I have had before. It was not good and cost me about 10 dollars of something I was only able to eat 1/4 of.   I wish I had ordered a sandwich with the salad because it looked much better than what I got. This place does have a huge menu and it's my fault for picking probably the worst thing on it.   I would give this place another chance but the service was really slow, granted it was late, and I just wish my soup was better. Overall one of my least favorite meals I have had in a long time and it should have been much better.",

Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.  Let me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE! I don't care if it's Vegas or not vegas, if you're a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you're at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.  Finally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was \"So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?\" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said \"Well then you can't have them!! It has all of those in it\" in a tone of voice assuming I'm supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, \"Egg noodles. You can't have that either!\" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it....  Food comes out, he doesn't even come back to check on us until after we're almost done and it's only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny's. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano's ambiance.",

We even ate here \"to go\" -- there's a separate shop in the front of the restaurant that sells \"to go\" sandwiches, salads, small portions, and espresso beverages.  Even for $6.99, the greek salad packed in a LOT of lettuce, flavor, toppings, cheese, etc. and took awhile to eat because there was SO MUCH LETTUCE packed into the plastic box.  So I'd recommend it for a quick meal.  The chicken salad sandwich ($5.99) was also surprisingly delicious, and the mayo wasn't all gross and light.",

Others at the table ordered the Zen noodles (think Vietnamese pho), salmon and beef with rice.  Everything was delicious and hearty in taste and size.  The service was impeccable.

I'm in the mood for soup, didn't like their soup options so I decide to have their Zen Noodles. After reading the menu description, I realize they're talking about pho, I say yes, that's perfect, definitely will hit the spot. So our server brings my noodles and I immediately notice that the bean sprouts look not so fresh, so I poke my finger into them and eeeeew!(mushy). I spoon a taste of broth and OMG! Are you kidding me! This tastes like chicken broth out of the can. I say whoa now! I am so not going to eat these noodles. So we call over the waiter asking him to send it back and to bring back a menu, (I said please) I felt bad for doing this but I usually pay around $5 for a good bowl of pho in the bay area and they were charging $14. The manager came over and apologized profusely and took care of us from there on, (good manager) Obviously the best thing here on out is if I want a bowl of Pho then I will only order from a noodle shop.",

    "text": "after a night of drinking, we were looking for a place to eat, the only place still open was the grad lux, its just like a cheesecake factory. The food was actually pretty good, I got the chicken salad sandwich, which came with lots of chicken salad. Other people ordered steal, duck dumplings, fried chicken 7 waffles, breakfast food, no one complained about the quality, the food was wonderful.   I knocked back a lot of stars because the service was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. we were waiting for our food for an hour, and one of the servers dropped my friends steak on the floor and had to go make another one, but they said they would not charge for  the steak since it took them so long to make it and the accident. So the steak took another 1/2 hr to come out. after we finished our food, it took them another 45 minutes to bring us the bill, it was the most waiting ive EVER done in my life for food and bill. and on top of that they charged us 2 times for the steak and the waiter apologized but then told us he had to \"ask his manager\" to take off the steaks. First of all, we didn't order 2 steaks, and we shouldnt pay for both, and 2nd they said it would be comp'd so it should of been. we waited another 30 min for them to take it off the bill. it was horrible service, I would go back to this place eventually, but it wont be for a while.",

From the decor to the take out bags.   Until a day later we realized it was created/founded or whatever by Cheesecake Factory. That was a lol on our part.   Service was mediocre that night because all the clubbers were heading here to eat their early morning meals and absorb as much alcohol as they can.    A handful of drunktards... including us.   Food: I was not hungry that night so all I got was a super small salad for a premo price. A couple friends ordered Zen Noodles.. aka the Hangover cure... that came wayy late. We were done eating already. We let the server know and he galdly tooked it off the bill.   After our meal, the manager came by to apologize and explain why it took so long. In addition to the free Zen Noodles, he gave us two orders of desserts to go. We thought it was a really nice gesture by him even though it was super busy that night.   I'm a fan.",

As usual, I did the ordering, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  We had chicken and waffles which was something different to try, but tasty,  steak sandwich - very good, fried calamari with rock shrimp - an excellent dish, salad & soup combo which was nothing special, we didnt  even finish half of it. However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it.  I love the service here, my waiter was nice, friendly & attentive, he came by few times to ask if everything was ok, and another gentleman which I guessed its the manager came over to check on us making sure we're well served. With an awesome service & food like this, I would love to come any time.",

They have a 'patio' type area in the front, and their bar, and some restaurant seating by the host area, don't let that fool you, in the back is a gigantic restaurant. Even if the line is long, you won't wait too long. You will probably spend more time looking at the menu trying to decide, then you will waiting for a table.

After the punishment wait was over we were seated and the menu has tons of different options. THe service was very friendly and attentive. When the food came the first thing I noticed was how big the portions are. I mean that plate was full. Although my stomach was ready to blow I had to had a piece of the cheesecake.

    "text": "I'm still really fond of this place because it's one of the better 24 hour joints on the strip. I've never actually eaten here during regular dining hours and probably wouldn't recommend doing so since Vegas has so many other restaurants to offer. I usually get the shaking beef...I just wish they put in more beef and less onions.  Service tends to lag a bit but we've never had any real problems until last week when a hostess could not appropriately handle a simple seating request. She led us to a table outside by the casino, which was too loud and noisy for our tastes so we asked if we could be seated further inside (there's a big room in the back with plenty of empty tables, we've eaten there often enough to know this). She quickly retorted there aren't any available and we'd have to wait. Uhm, what? You didn't even bother to check! We agree to wait for one, so we follow her back to the front and my boyfriend asks her how long the wait is...but she simply shrugs her shoulders and rudely turns away to chat with the other hostess. Meanwhile, we're sitting there waiting for almost 10 minutes being completely ignored, as we see 4 different small parties being seated...a few of which were led directly to the back dining room where we requested to be. WTF. When we were finally seated, we notice that the party who came after us was seated at a big comfy booth while we were stuck at one of the tables with the most foot traffic. This peeved the BF so much that he felt obligated to speak to the manager, who understood our concern and apologized profusely, even throwing in a free bag of cookies. Anyways, moral of the story is if you can't be friendly to a customer and make them feel welcomed, you probably shouldn't be a host or hostess at a restaurant.",

    "text": "While dodging porn stars and technophiles, my crew and I were desperately searching for a place to eat. Zine in the Palazzo was a bit pricey for a quick bite. We sat down at Noodles at the Venetian, but after 10 minutes and not even a fly-by from a waitress, we left. We landed at the Grand Lux in the Venetian, and I was impressed.   The menu is huge. I can not imagine someone being unable to find their particular craving, and although there are only two specific vegetarian entrees, they are both delicious. I had the most insane vegetable plate (red cabbage, mashed sweet potatoes to name two), and they even let me substitute green beans for the white rice it was supposed to be served with. We also had the tofu entree, and it was equally delicious, perhaps a little sweet for everyday consumption, but a great treat. The smoothies are top-notch. As you can see from the pictures, everything looks amazing, which means a lot to me. When someone in the kitchen cares enough to make it look pretty, it is a  promising sign it will taste good.  The fact that the Grand Lux pulls it off while serving a dining room of probably at least 5000 square feet makes me love it even more.  In the battle of 24-hour upscale diner/cafe casinoland, The Grand Lux definitely exceeds Cafe Bellagio in taste and presentation. True, sometimes you just need to gaze at a spectacular flower display while chomping on your $18 patty melt, but if scenery is not a concern, head to the Grand Lux.",

The food was spectacular! I had the chicken royale, and it was one of the best things I've tried in a while. Later in the night, we ran down for a late night slice of cheesecake, and it was so creamy & delicious. I would definitely come back, the food is worth the slow service.",

We walked the strip, discouraged by the quick stop places that were open and even had the \"Dennys\" conversation but alas as we slithered through another casino it seemed there was a place open for business and that place was the Grand Lux Cafe. The restaurant could have used better lighting but then again it could be seen as \"romantic\" atmosphere. Perhaps so much so that the patrons at the table next to ours may have gotten so lost in their own world, they forgot other people around them can hear their bedroom conversations.  I've never met the woman before but I now have a great knowledge of her working woman parts. I did lose my appetite quite quickly and luckily we decided to take our meals back to the hotel but I can't complain too much, it's Vegas!  Pros: Best fettuccine Alfredo I have ever eaten in my life. Open late. Fast seating and service.  Cons: Can be very noisy. But c'mon, it's Vegas, baby!",

This was my first time ordering togo at Grand Lux so I was surprised to see a few really cheap items on the menu.  Chicken or tuna salad sandwiches were only about $6!  I ordered a tuna salad sandwich and a Caesar Salad for $4.95 and instantly received my food because they were both premade.  -Tuna Salad Sandwich: just your regular bread with lettuce and tomato, stuffed with tuna salad that was below average.  I've had premade tuna salad sandwiches on campus at UCSD and they were a lot better. -Caesar Salad: crunchy lettuce is a plus!  But the ranch looked grainy and tasted spicy!  Wat the eff?  Please up the service and quality of food, Grand Lux.  Or else you don't deserve to be serving Venetian customers!",

But for me I wanted to try something that was a different experience.   So I came here with a group of people (7 people) and we all shared our entrees.   **FOOD: - We ordered the Grand Italian pizza and according to my brother, it tasted like something that you can get from the frozen aisle at a Ralphs. - Pasta with Chicken, Sun dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms and Pasta Carbonara was too CHEESY!! After a few hours, the boy and I got a tummy ache. I would not recommend the pasta entrees. It isn't great (my opinion).  - The Sonoma Salad was probably the only OK entree. I mean you can't go wrong with a salad.  - The other entree was a bake chicken with mash potatoes, no bueno. My cousin said the chicken was dry.   Overall I would recommend this restaurant if you do like the American type of food and if you're on a tight budget (entrees range from $10-$20) . But I would definitely not come here again.",

We got right in, had amazing service that went above and beyond to help make it a nice dinner despite having 2, 4 and 6 year olds with us.  The Cobb salad was as good a salad as I have ever had at a restaurant; fresh, high quality chicken, bacon and blue cheese.  Wife loved her smaller chop salad.

    "text": "What an amazing find this place was! Went last week when we were on vacation.  We weren't really wanting a big dinner and so we'd passed all the trendy/pricey upscale places.  They're fine when you're wanting a nice dinner out but we just wanted something simple.  We walked past this place and decided to give it a try. I'm so happy we did!  There were several people in line to get a table and I was worried that we'd have to wait a long time for a table, but it's deceptively large and so it only took like 5 minutes for them to seat us.  We were seated at a table for 2 that one side is a long bench and the other side chairs.  So there were people next to us, but enough room for me to get in/out.  Even though we were close to the people next to us we didn't find it hard to hear each other and we couldn't hear anyones conversations except the ladies right next to us. That is such a plus in my mind.  The menu has lots of choices - pasta, salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes, steaks, etc.  this is a perfect place in vegas when you're with several people and not everyone wants just sushi or italian.    They bring out nice warm bread (and butter) after seating you.  My husband and I both opted for hamburgers. He got the Max burger (with short ribs on the burger, hello!) and I got the bacon cheese burger. They easily substituted cheddar for me instead of american.  Burgers were about $12-13 each and came with fries or organic green salad.  This was the largest regular size restaurant burger I've ever had and also the best I've had. It truly looked as if when I ordered it, the guy in the kitchen pulled out some ground beef and made my patty by hand.  I couldn't even quite finish 1/2 of it.  And I can eat an entire red robin burger.  Seriously, it was just delicious.   Service was wonderful. The waitress seemed to notice every time we needed a refill on drinks and was quick to check on how things were going and bring extra condiments we wanted.    This is a must eat place for me on any future trips to Vegas.  Next time though, we'll be splitting the burger, haha!",

    "text": "I wanted some casual dining places options on my trip to Vegas and my girlfriend had been here and liked it. After having read some raving reviews...I figured this would be a good choice.  Hm..I have to say, I was really overwhelmed with the menu. Where to start? What to choose? There's breakfast food, sandwiches & burgers, and even \"comfort food.\" It was so hard to choose from...I went with the half sandwich, soup, salad combo and it was a great deal for $10!  I'll def make a pit stop here when my tummy's growling on the strip. Affordable casual foods at super great prices =) Also...open 24 hours! Theres nothing like this opened 24 hours at Wynn/Encore..so just walk on over to Grand Lux in the Venetian!",

And the waffle was a perfect fluff that would disappear in my mouth, very cotton candy like.  The chicken strips were under seasoned, like no salt at all, so I just dumped it in ketchup and that was perfection.",

Service was great, we were in and out in no time. Awesome menu, very hard to choose, I guess I'll have to go back.  Every casino has their own little 24hr cafe type place, many of them seem very generic, this one is probably the best casino restaurant I've been to. You could put this place in just about any town as a stand alone restaurant and it would be a local favorite.",

    "text": "let me start the review by saying if you haven't been here while staying at the venetian, you REALLY messed up. The ambiance is pretty relaxed compared to any other restaurant on the strip. Came here with co-workers for a bite to eat after one of those vegas nights. Ordered spicy ginger beef and it was AMAZING. Came with veggies and choice of rice. Very well seasoned and not too much soy. Veggies balance out the amount of salt. I tried some of the chicken and waffles, while sober keep in mind, and it was literally the best chicken and waffles experience of my life. I had the same dish at founding farmers in Washington D.C. and was pretty disappointed. The bread is also warm and served with a huge square of butter, im talking quarter of the whole stick huge. Server was very attentive and kept the table updated when the food took a little long to come out. Refilled water multiple times and made sure we got all the bread we can eat.  Great place, wish all the cheesecake factories had this menu, then again theres only one Vegas!",

    "text": "Grand Lux Cafe isn't your typical cafe with the typical diner type items. It's actually a classier looking restaurant that has a huge resemblance to Cheesecake Factory. And after speaking to our waitress, we found out they had the same owner. The food is similar too but in my opinion, the quality is much much better here at the Grand Luxe.   For appetizers, the BF and I shared crabcakes which were sooo sooooooo goood! Loved the dipping sauce that came with it and the crabcake itself had perfect texture and flavor. Couldn't remember the cocktails we had but we loved them too - got us a pretty nice buzz going even before our main course.  For our main dish, I ordered the Miso Glazed Salmon and the BF had the Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms tossed lightly in a garlic, creamy, parmesan cheese sauce. Both were superb in taste!   Best part about this place? It opens 24 hours! Woooohoooo! Definitely a big plus when we stay at the Venetian! Helps with my usual late night munchies =)",

    "text": "We came here after a failed breakfast attempt at Bouchon (who serves lunch at 10:30 anyway?). Yeah, it's a glorified version of the Cheesecake Factory.   The hostesses seemed bothered that they had to actually earn a living by seating the likes of us; I actually think that they rolled their eyes when we approached. Conversation seemed forced, perhaps some requirement of Grand Lux (So, where are you guys from?), rather than genuine curiousity.   I can't believe the waiter actually suggested the breakfast buffet. $15.95 will get you eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit and yogurt *yawn*. After previewing the buffet, I told the waiter that I preferred something 'not so basic'. I asked his opinion on the chiliquiles and the huevos rancheros. He said that the chiliquiles were good, but an Americanized version.   I ordered the huevos rancheros. Freaking delicious, I tell you. The sauce was spicy and the black beans, onions and bell peppers were a fabulous addition.   The waiter was helpful at first, but disappeared before our meals arrived. What the heck?   Damn you, Bouchon, for stopping breakfast service at 10:30!",

Worth mentioning, the Duck Potstickers, really really tasty and surprisingly filling.   Ordered the taquitos/flautas .... rather bland. Avoid  This wasn't my first time here, on a prior visit I tried the Chicken Piccatta that was a great dish.   The menu is extensive, something for everyone, Cheesecake Factory affiliated, you can tell by the decor but I think the menu is way more expansive and the chef does a much better job here!  Check this place out especially if you are looking for tasty food late night!!",

I requested a turkey burger with no sauce and Nathan did not seem to understand this.  He kept questioning and questioning the fact that I wanted my burger with no sauce. He never confirmed my order and actually skipped over completely my order and started asking the other guest with me what they wanted to order.  This was completely RUDE of Nathan \"Nate\".  Not sure if Nathan was having a bad day, but Nathan needs to be retrained on how to be a professional waiter.  Having an attitude and an ego as a waiter will get you no where Nathan.  My party and I ended up leaving and not dining at the Grand Lux.  The manager stopped by the table but was useless and unhelpful.",

However, most everyone else had difficulty chewing theirs off the same plate. I'm suspecting some mixing of fresh and not-quite-so-fresh product... Asian Nachos (I think??): Very tasty, and had sesame seeds! (YAY!) Maui Marinated Ribeye: Bad cut of meat. Cut too thin to easily cook medium-rare, so it didn't have the right texture. Marinade was overpowering (Yeah, I get that it's marinated, but yuck.) The mashed potatoes were good, but nothing out of this world.  Decent prices. Service was great if you were drinking. Switching to water meant no refills. Blam.",

    "text": "I checked out the Grand Lux Cafe twice during my weeklong stay in LV. I went the first time because it was near my hotel and was relatively affordable. I went the second time because the first meal was that good.  The GLC gives off the vibe of an upscale diner. It has a large and diverse menu, which covers all sorts of different options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's also open 24 hours. The price point is really reasonable for LV - anywhere from $10-$20 for the average meal. The server also told me that the pasta portions are gigantic, though I didn't have pasta when I was there.  The first time I went to GLC was on a weeknight. It wasn't busy, and I got a table immediately. I ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt with fries, which was quite delicious. The burger was cooked very well. The fries were a little soggy, but not too bad. The portion size was reasonable for the cost. They also give you bread as you're waiting for your meal, and the bread was freshly baked and warm, which I appreciated.  The second time I went to the GLC was on a Friday for lunch. The place was packed with a line out of the restaurant. However, the line moved fairly quickly, and I got a table within ten minutes of getting in line.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me tell you, that was outstanding. Huge waffle. Really flavorful and moist chicken. The Pecan Honey-Butter Sauce was delicious, and the waffle itself was covered in pecans to add some texture that I enjoyed. It was also very reasonably priced for lunch fare.  Why am I not giving this a five star rating?  Simply, the wait time from the order to having the meal served was too long. On Tuesday, I waited at least 1/2 an hour to get the burger, and on Friday, it took even longer than that. If it's busy, I can understand that. The size of their menu, which is quite massive and diverse, certainly adds additional challenges. However, the place was dead on weeknight and I still waited too long. That knocks it down a bit.  Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "Ok, this place is just really awesome.  Open 24 hours a day?  The most convenient thing ever especially in Vegas.  Eating food after a night in the club is a definite must to let all the alcohol sink in.  The food here was absolutely amazing too.  Or was it only amazing because I was drunk?  No, it really was amazing.  Since I stayed at the Palazzo, I was reasonably close, and came here to eat for a meal for like 3 days in a row, and it was always delicious!  Meals also come with complimentary bread and butter..the bread was always warm, and very soft in the center. Yum.  A few things that I tried...and loved  Shrimp Scampi Pasta $20  This came with HUGE pieces of shrimp and the pasta was extremely tasty..the cream in the pasta was not too overwhelming and they put in just the right amount so that the pasta was not swimming in pasta sauce.  The serving for this dish was huge..we split it among 3 girls and it was perfect.  Garlic Shrimp Pasta $19  Also delicious, but similar to the shrimp scampi pasta...size of shrimp was considerably smaller..also came with fresh heirloom tomatoes, and some asparagus.  Over all, a very delicious meal.   Chicken and Avocado Salad lunch portion $12  Vegetables were super fresh, the dressing that came on the side was very tasty, and serving for extremely large.  A healthy meal to counter all the alcohol that was consumed the night before.  The only downside of this restaurant would be the fact that the wait time for the food was a little bit on the long side, but besides this..it is definite a great place to eat food for any time during the day.",
