They all ordered the Fiesta Nachos while I ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nachos. We were also able to use the Yelp Promo for a free Margarita, so it was a bomb combo. The nachos didn't disappoint. Good to taste and at a good value for your money. The plates were huge and it seemed like I wouldn't be able to finish them, but I did anyways.  Key tip: If you buy a Fat Tuesday from inside Planet Hollywood and then come here, they'll take your Fat Tuesday and keep it in their \"Freezer.\" it'll turn mushy later when your done with the food. Either buy it well before you head here, buy it after, or down it quickly at the door.",

First of its so hard to find because on google it says it's inside the miracle mile shops but it's not. You can only get to it from Harmon Ave, and it's not on Las Vegas Blvd. The reason for giving it more the one star is the queso was actually really good.  That was the only good part of the visit. The first thing I noticed that threw me was a broken glass on the floor. It was there for a good while until I finally brought it to someone's attention that cleaned it up. That seemed like a huge safety issue if someone stepped on it. The main dish I got was a seafood enchilada platter which tasted like the seafood had gone bad. When I brought that to our servers attention she replied \"sorry, I'll let the kitchen know\". No other offer was made to replace the dish. I didn't eat any of eat but I guess that's not her problem. Maybe I chose the wrong dish at a nacho restaurant so steer clear.",

Once we walked in we went to the bar where a busboy was cleaning off the bar top.. we asked kindly if the bar top was self seating and he said yes and then a few minutes later he looks at my boyfriend and goes,\" hey chill out! Okay?\" We were so confused as to why he said that, I am a server in the restaurant business and I would never say that. We literally were just standing waiting for him to clean the counter top. Hopefully he sees some better days and attitude! But, right then and there we should of just left, the food was whatever . Filet mignon nachos has some sort of chili which I found weird . I would rather not have filet mignon in some sort of sauce! Quesadilla average! Only getting two stars because of the bartenders! They are great and very nice! But won't be coming back",

I always try to make an effort to come to Nacho Daddy when I'm in Vegas because it's a great restaurant with good service and yummy food for a reasonable price. It's a fun environment with constant music playing and a large dining space to accommodate larger parties. I've tried the fajitas here before and they're pretty good, somewhat sparing on the meat and heavy on the veggies.   This time, however, I decided to get the nachos. They're probably meant for sharing but I was able to kill it on my own because they were that good. The restaurant is conveniently located on Miracle Mile so if you pass by be sure to check it out. If not for the food at least do it for the Scorpion shot",

    "text": "We visited Nacho Daddy at about 2pm on Saturday, November 1st with just a party of two. We were seated after approximately a 15 minute wait.    So, we ordered two orders of Nachos and shared each one.  There were so many good choices, and it was difficult to choose.   This place knows how to make nachos.  I mean, wow!  There motto is \"never a dry chip\", and they pretty much hold to that.  They were covered and coated. YUM!  We ordered the Chicken Tinga Nacho and the Spicy Shrimp Nacho. Both of them were absolutely delicious; however, we enjoyed the Chicken Tinga just a little bit more.    I did order the Spicy Shrimp without tomato.  As they were coming out, they took them back as the server forgot to place the order with the no tomato instruction.   Although we did have a 15 minute delay in receiving them, she did catch them before they reached our table, plus the manager came over and fully comped that one entree, without ever complaining or even inquiring.   So, we felt that was a nice gesture and very kind of them to do so without asking.  With that said, I know it is difficult to keep everything out of a restaurant that has open windows on the outside; however, there were four birds flying around the restaurant the entire time that we were there.  To be honest, it was really annoying.  And you never knew, whether or not there business would fall on top of you.  Luckily, it did not.  I know that it is hard to control; however, I never really seen this as a problem in other restaurants.  So, I hope this isn't a long term problem.  Anyway, I would return again -- and likely I would expect a five star experience next time.",

Once we got inside there was a wait but we got Seated quick .. there was so much to order on the menu ( beware everything looks good ) for drinks I order a mango margarita. Omg . So good , wasn't to strong which was perfect. I was able to finish it . For appetizer we order the fiesta nachos which came with beans , tender chicken , pico de Gallo , sour cream , guacamole , basically a basic nacho but so delicious , the nachos are also huge portions , I shared with my husband so it filled us up quick . We wanted to keep eating but we also ordered entrees so we didn't want to get to full . For my entree I ordered a chicken chimichanga , nothing special but it was also delicious . The only downside of our lunch was that our waiter went on her break and we were sitting there waiting for our check and she never came to check up on us so the manager had to help us . The least she can do was let us know she was going on her break but overall I definitely recommend this place .",

Their nachos are very unique, and decently priced. And of course, they have their famous scorpion shot with an actual scorpion inside your alcohol.  I ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Nachos. There was a generous portion and the chicken was great! The Daddy Margarita was also very flavorful.   All in all, it was a great experience and definitely would come back! Maybe next time I'll grow a pair and actually try the scorpion shot haha",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy was such a fun experience. As a self-proclaimed nacho enthusiast, I felt absolutely compelled to check out any establishment called \"Nacho Daddy\". I mean, how could a place with that name not be amazing??? I had gone on a trip to Vegas a month prior to my Nacho Daddy visit and saw one of the locations as I was on my way to the airport. I swore to myself that I would be vising this alluring nacho establishment the next time I found myself in this twinkling desert. Fast forward to this trip with my friends, and me finding myself in Vegas a good 6 hours before my friends landed. I knew we had a jam-packed schedule and decided that if Nacho Daddy were going to happen, I would need to make it a party-of-one dinner before they landed.  There was an intimidating crowd of people at the door when I walked in, and I feared that the wait might be insane. Luckily for me, the bar had plenty of open seating, so I plopped down to order my first drink. I mean, nachos and margaritas are like humans and oxygen; they need each other, right? Okay, maybe that's a slightly extravagant comparison, but, you get it. So I order their house margarita from the gruff, but nice bartender (oxymoron? No! He looked like he would be grumpy but was totally nice to me in a Ron Swanson way) and started to peruse the most intimidating nacho selection I have ever come upon. First of all, I'm an indecisive person. Second of all, all of their nachos were so creative and delicious sounding, I started to get panicky, afraid I'd never make up my mind and just end up drowning in margaritas! Okay that isn't such a BAD thing... Anyways, after staring at their giant list of nacho combinations, I went with the Supreme Tostada Nachos. You guys... what arrived in front of me was heaven on a plate. One of my favorite things about these nachos were that they had the both of best worlds- shredded cheese AND the delightful gooey queso. I can never decide which I like best, so having both on one plate was a dream come True.   I felt a tiny bit self conscious being a girl all alone at the bar with an enormous plate of nachos all to myself, but eff em, I'm here for the nachos. So I dove in and stuffed myself, and there was STILL a lot left. I would definitely like to return with friends so that we could order a variety of the nacho options, because there were definitely others I wanted to try. Nacho Daddy gets 5 big fat stars from me for being my own little slice of nacho heaven.",

Rustic and industrial designs that made me feel at ease. We were seated within 30 minutes and quickly ordered the 4 cheese nacho plate. When it arrived we realized it was a mistake. The plate was literally dripping with cheese. Cheese overkill. Just too much. Soggy nachos are no fun. Then we noticed the huge projection screen. It's over 150\" diagonal, but sadly is out of focus and the color is off. It looks no better than SD resolution. Also the HD flat panels on the wall are off. The one closest to us had no red channel at all. See Coors logo in pic. It's not red. The rest of the meal, surf and turf tacos and crispy beef tacos were lack luster, just average. The best part was the homemade crispy shells on the beef tacos. Oh, the house margarita on the rocks was excellent as well. But overall a disappointing experience given the crappy AV equipment setup, soggy nachos and mediocre tacos. You can do better Nacho Daddy. Need to up your game to attract people that know good Mexican food and want to watch a game on a good and properly calibrated display!",

The food was awesome, I got the four cheese nachos with chicken added.  My buddy got the Buffalo chicken nachos, they had some heat to them.

I wasn't sure if auto gratuity was included in the bill and asked her. She let me know that is was not and that they do not include it. I immediately felt star struck worried that she could take care of people that could not tip perhaps. Is this a corporate policy? These servers deserve every dollar they make and it would be a shame for anyone to take advantage of that! Love the place it was perfect as usual!",

It did not appear to be as busy as the night before (Saturday) despite heavy foot traffic associated with evening marathon race. Couple came in after us and decided to take table closer to bar.  After finally being seated in a booth it was at least another five minutes before I got up to inquire as to whether or not  someone was assigned that station. (Meanwhile employees were walking back and forth to kitchen) and no one ever acknowledged us. Friend and I finally decided to leave and walk back to eat at one of the places inside the mall.  Nacho Daddy.....definitely not.",

Next the appetizer came out wrong it was Mexican corn that was supposed to be off the cob but it was on which wasn't a big deal but then the food came out and it was also wrong sauce that wasn't supposed to be on our nachos was on them and the lobster and crab tacos had a wang to them that you never want to taste when eating sea food anywhere they only received two stars because or server was present and checked on us even though it was likely her that turned the orders in wrong and not the kitchen making that many mistakes. The kitchen was open air which is fine but anytime anything was served on a hot plate it created so much smoke and steam it filled up most of the dining room. There were several large tv's with music very loud and played 6 weezer music videos back to back which was terrible and when that was over a migos loop started which was even worse we will not be back",

Then she took the time to recommend what margarita to pick.  She even went and got a sample for us (we decided on the blood orange margarita and it was fantastic).  Then we wanted to split a nacho and she was super helpful in explaining all the menu items.  We decided on the BBQ chicken nachos and the pulled pork chimichanga and let me say she was on point with her recommendations.  I highly recommend this restaurant and you will be extra lucky if Arieanna is your waitress.",

Margaritas were top notch, just like I'm used to in Texas. The atmosphere was also great with old school rock music videos playing. Since it's slightly off the strip, the prices are very reasonable compared to the quality. I will be back tomorrow for happy hour for sure. Great hidden gem!",

We checked in with our yelp app and everyone at the table received a free margarita.  The margaritas were standard house margaritas. They were pretty good, nothing to rave about or scoff at.  I ordered the special chicken taco, chicken enchilada and rice. The taco was insanely huge. I would go as far as calling it a burrito quite honestly. It was good chicken, the grilled onions were delicious. The chicken enchilada was tasty as well but had I known the taco was so big, I may have just ordered a couple tacos.  The rice was definitely disappointing. A bit too much tomato sauce and the rice was dry, leading me to believe it wasn't fresh.  Overall the food was fine, the drinks were fine and the service was good. Only 3 stars though because there is nothing I would recommend as being great. Basically average Mexican food.",

There's gotta be some item for everyone. We ordered the four cheese nachos, the mexi-Cali burger, a chicken tamale, and the breakfast tacos. Everything was served hot and looked presentable. My tacos were bomb!! Their rice was a little dry and bland so you may need to throw some hot sauce on it. Their nachos are really good! Next time I'd try the spicy shrimp ones. All their portions are hugeeee and not badly priced at all! We paid about $75 for 2 margaritas, one appetizer, and three entrees. For Vegas, that's a deal.",

Our spicy shrimp nachos were amply stacked with jumbo shrimp. The juicy filet mignon steak nachos complimented the spicy shrimp perfectly and there was no skimping on seafood or quality steak.

There are many varieties of nachos and selections on their menu. I decided to try the Lobster Crab Nachos. The portion size is definitely shareable. Although a little pricey (27$ish without tip), the food did came out fresh and you can tell it wasn't laying out on the counter for a long period of time before it was brought over to your table.   The chips were super fresh and the flavors on this dish were great. I was impressed with the ingredients they've mixed in with the lobster and crab to make it savory, citrusy, while not having the crab/lobster overwhelm the dish. Everything was well balanced!  This location is not inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel but is located outside. I walked in circles inside the hotel building trying to look for this place until I realized it was outside haha.   The only reason I gave it a 4/5 stars is because I noticed dust mites were falling from the ceiling into our water cup. When I looked up, I noticed a lot of clumped up dust/particles that would fall from time to time. I thought of moving seats but it was like that everywhere. They're in desperate need to dusting. Oh well, the nachos were still really good.",

I went for the Golden Knights Nachos since it had everything and it was nice that a portion of the proceeds for the dish was going to a good cause.  Like I said, giant $18 plate of nachos all to myself. These nachos are fully loaded and stacked. Every chip is covered with either toppings, melted cheese, and queso. A fork is definitely needed to make sure you pick up everything and leave no food behind. Especially that filet mignon. Tender and delicious... all nachos should have filet mignon for me at this point. Lastly, that yellow queso is liquid gold.   Looks pretty busy on the weekend. I went here at 2 pm and there was a wait if you wanted a table. I sat at the bar, but even then, it was pretty crowded as seats were limited.   They have a pretty big menu so it's going to be easy to want to order other things, but don't forget the nachos!",

Nacho Daddy had great reviews and was just across the street, so we decided to eat here.   Despite the emptiness of the restaurant, we had to wait about 20mins. I think they were short staffed that day because it also took awhile to get our nachos. But it was worth it! I got the chicken tinga nachos, and there was chicken in every bite. It was very textural too, with the soft beans and the crunchy chips. I could've easily shared this with 2 other people. I had enough leftovers for breakfast the next day.   Even though they were short staffed, every employee that passed by made sure we were doing well, and I appreciated that. I also appreciated their awesome 90s music playlist!  The atmosphere is loud, and the decor is kinda Old West, but that's Vegas.   I would love come back and dine here again. You can always order for pick up if you want to eat at your hotel. But if you dine-in, you can use the Yelp check-in offer to get a free house drink.",

    "text": "I used to go to Vegas every February with my friends for a week of golf, gambling, food, boozing, and general debauchery. If you read my review on Twin Peaks I mention a couple of specifics. Please, go back, and read it. Some would say its my For Whom The Bell Tolls. But I digress.   The key phrase in the opening sentence is \"used to.\" At some point I got old, and I couldn't hang for a week of defiling myself. So, its been 5 years since I last made the trip. That was until this fall when my friends guilt trip group texted me into getting the gang back together. I don't know what I was thinking...  After the second night of binge boozing I figured it was time to eat a real meal. My best friend said I have a place in mind that I think you'll like. I'm not sure I mentioned that I love nachos...I think i mentioned that on one of my dating profiles, so I get a lot of messages about nachos...which isn't as sexy as you'd think it would be. Oh yeah, ladies, still single, I know, shocking, so holler at your boy (you'd be surprised how many women have slid into my Yelp DMs).   Back to my point, you know how Jesus loves all humans no matter how monstrous they may be? That's how I love nachos. They're all my children, and I take in, forgive, and love them all equally. From the gas station fake cheese ones, to whimsical food truck creations. Give me your cold muddled masses of cheese chips for I will nurture them. That Nas, and Kelis love. Oh wait, that one didn't work out...  Pro Tip: Check in on Yelp when you get to this joint. Not sure it works for everyone, but I got a free Margarita coupon. The only thing I like more than free booze is 90's hip hop vinyl finds out in the wild, a corgi running, and a new Tarintino flick.   Sidenote: The last five or so women I've met have not seen Pulp Fiction. How fucking insane is that. They're in their 30's, so its not because of age. Cinematic malfeasance if you ask me! Although, I've never seen the Godfather, so who am i to judge. I'm taking that to the grave on GP. A man has to stand for something, right?   As soon as I saw the sign for where we were going I lit up, and thought, \"this is why he's my best friend.\" A single tear might have come out of my eye, but that also could have been my eyes hydrating themselves since I hadn't taken out my contacts in two days. Thanks booze.   We sat at the bar (as you always should), and the service couldn't have been better. The bartender was prompt, inviting, and overall great. I ordered a local IPA, Jameson neat, and the Filet Mignonette Nachos. I think that's their top shelf nachos cause it was the most expensive too. I tend to gravitate to the highest priced menu item. My ex used to say I live a lush life, and like the finer things, and I'm not going to argue with her (one of the only times I didn't argue with her, hence why she's my ex).   The nachos came out on a cast iron plate, and we rather large. They're enough for two people, but my friends ordered their own plates, so we were washed in a bounty greater than gold. My plate had queso, guac, and all the fixings piled high. The nachos were pretty good, but then I'm easy when I have a beer, and hook. We also ordered a dip trio that was good as well. I almost enjoyed that more as I like my chips crispy, and with so much toppings some of the chips got soggy, and I had to use a fork. No biggie though.   I enjoyed Nacho Daddy, and thought the food, and service were wonderful. Aren't nachos, and booze what Vegas is all about? Well, maybe not just Vegas, cause the aforementioned do encapsulate my life. I'm a simple man, unlike the nacho's at this joint. Hey, how about ya'll franchise a joint in Seattle, so I can life a fuller life? Now that's a Eureka moment! Take it easy people, Salute!",

The shrimp was very good and it wasn't a long wait like everywhere else during dinner time.   Not a fan of Mexican food but didn't want to wait over two hours at other places so decided to go here and we were not disappointed.",

Didn't try the nachos but did try the guacamole and salsa, which were super great (and they refill as you need - not the guac). The lobster tacos were just okay- the lobster itself was much smaller than they should've been, so I wouldn't recommend that if you want lots of lobster or protein in your taco. Still yummy though.   The simple hardshell tacos on the menu (forget what they're called) were really good. I really recommend it. Super simple and Americanized tacos, but hits the spot.   Extra points for the great bartenders and amazing margaritas!",

The margaritas even though had a good taste were wayyyy too sweet so we could barely drink half of it unfortunately. The dip had a nice taste but was way too salty (and I love salt) so we could only eat half of that also. The nachos were the bomb, probably the best nachos I've ever had. Definitely liked the place and will be back but will skip the dip and the margaritas. Overall great place for any nachos fans out there!",

We ordered the filet mignon nachos and bottomless chips and salsa. In retrospect, we probably would have only ordered the nachos because the nachos can feed 3-4 people alone.   The nachos were great, but after a while it starts to sit heavy in your stomach and the nachos turn soggy if you don't eat them quick. Not sure if it's worth the $19.95 either.   Otherwise, the service was great and you get a free margarita if you check in on yelp.   Great place to eat drunk food after midnight on the strip!",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here beginning of February. Our first time, and we loved everything!  Our server, I believe her name is Judy, was very honest and helpful with recommendations.  For example, she recommended items that were not only delicious (we ended up ordering most of them), but they weren't the most expensive items on the menu either. I found that important because there are so many servers at other restaurants whose recommendations aren't actually that tasty, but just happen to be the most expensive item. Or, all the items they recommend are really expensive, which I find they're just bs-ing for a bigger tip.   Anyway, Judy was attentive, honest about the food, friendly, and polite!  My husband and I shared the filet mignon shrimp combo fajitas (so damn good!) and despite us having a smaller cost order, our service was excellent! You know how sometimes the service kind of goes down because not much was ordered? Not the case for us that night.   I'm also a HUGE salsa lover, but not a lover of all salsas-if the salsa isn't spicy and if it's watery...no thanks! But the salsa here is the blended type (which I love because it'll stay on the chip easily and it's my watery) and each kind was tasty and spicy in its own way.   Only thing we didn't like too much- the house margaritas had too much of the mix in it. If it were just a little less, then they would've been the best house made margaritas I've had.    But we will still definitely go back for the food and try the margaritas again!",

Finally our last night here before our show Ka, we stopped by for some margaritas and nachos! Our server was super nice! We ordered the Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cobb, Daddy's Buffalo Wings, and the Golden Knights Nachos. The nachos comes with filet mignon but we switched it to chicken. The margaritas were awesome and strong! Our wings came out the Naked wings instead of the breaded and our server apologized- which was no big deal since we were planning to put in another order of wings! She was awesome for taking the Naked wings off of our tab since we didn't ordered it but honestly if that mistake didn't happened we would've never tried the Naked wings and we all agreed the Naked wings was so much better than the breaded! It was so flavorful! Everything was delicious! Loved the music as well! So sad we didn't try this sooner! We will definitely come back here next time we're in town!",

Server was very friendly and offered suggestions on what to get.  Decided to get the filet mignon nachos, taco-enchilada combo, and mojo pork tacos.  Also got two quesadillas for the kids from the kid's menu. We also got two free margaritas if it's your first time checking in to this place on yelp.  The food came out pretty quickly.  The tacos were very good and there was plenty of tender pork in the tacos.  The nachos were good, but nothing too spectacular.  I'm actually glad I got the free margarita as it was very tasty.  Total for three adults and two kids was around $60 bucks.  It's a decent price for Vegas and everyone left full and happy.",

    "text": "In short, this place has super cool vibes, awesome service & ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOOD!   Our group (7 people) initially stopped by around 12:00pm on Saturday but was told it was a 45 min wait. We dropped by again on Sunday around the same time and was seated almost immediately (but the rush came shortly after). You could call ahead and add yourself to the waitlist.   FOOD (items I tried): - Filet Mignon Nachos: Seriously the ultimate plate of nachos. SO BOMB. The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The sauces, cheese, and guacamole just infused together SO perfectly. I could finish one plate by myself if I were SUPER hungry, but I think it would be best for sharing. - Smothered Burrito (w/ both red and green enchilada sauces): HUGE and pretty good. You could add queso (instead of enchilada sauce) for an extra $2...but I think I prefer the red enchilada sauce. It also comes with a side of chips & salsa which we didn't end up touching because of our nachos. - Daddy's Margarita (free w/ Yelp check-in): Pretty yummy & refreshing! I noticed the frozen margaritas were A LOT stronger than the iced ones. Pick your poison.  SERVICE, ETC.: Our server was Huck & he was super great, friendly, and helpful. The food took a while to come out. But when it did, we all got our orders at the same time (though some plates weren't as hot as others).   The World Cup game was on, so the super big flat-screen TVs scattered throughout the restaurant were perfect for the occasion.  It's opened pretty late so it's PERFECT for late night drunchies.  TBH, I'd choose this place over a buffet any day. A must-try if you're in Vegas!",

Everyone else loved their nachos and chicken wings. The skinny margarita was good. The wait on a Wednesday wasn't bad. Maybe waited 20m. Though if you can find seating at the bar that's easier. They played 90s music videos. We enjoyed that too. There isn't a good wine selection but I guess wine and nachos don't go together. It's not your normal average crowd. It's loud too. I would go back.

When it was time to order we had a range of goodies. I ordered the filet mignon nachos (absolute heaven). The table also had fish tacos, chicken tacos, queso, & salsa.

On the Las Vegas Strip, that is a lot of trust to put in the hands of others. The girl said we could chug them otherwise and that wasn't going to happen but it was late and we were starving. I asked if we could put them somewhere out of reach near our table and that was refused and I just feel like this is poor customer service. I was happy to buy a drink there but they clearly didn't care and it said the mood for a poor experience.   I was not overly impressed with the nachos and I was really unimpressed with the skinny margarita. We have been spoiled by having some really fantastic nachos and some delicious margaritas and these were not living up to my expectations. I've had plenty of skinny margaritas that didn't taste like club soda but this one was particularly awful. Our waitress was nice and offered to remake it for me but I just couldn't stomach the mixture with the club soda so she took it off of our bill. I drink vodka club too so this was particularly odd but it just didn't taste like a margarita!  We shared a plate of the nachos and we took advantage of the yelp check-in offer to get a free house margarita but the Nacho Daddy margarita is NOT it so don't be fooled. I guess just ask which is the house - we just paid the $3-4 upgrade fee.   Overly disappointed with the experience and hostess's customer service. I definitely think it's worth trying other options on The Strip",

The place has ridiculously high ceilings which makes you wonder why they aren't using the square footage to its potential-hello-put in a second level. Anyway, my boyfriend got the street tacos-there were three of them and he said the meat was flavored well. I had the fajita salad which came in. Large tostada bowl. It had Mexican rice, sour cream, cheese, peppers and onions, lettuce, beans, and some tasty grilled chicken. It was more than I could eat, but I was surprised at the good flavors. This place is right off the strip. Convenient location. Oh, the house margarita is pretty good too. I was pleasantly surprised by this find. They did Mexican right!  Btw the menu was too large to take pics of and I was too hungry to take them.",

    "text": "We stopped in at this newly opened restaurant pretty close to our hotel and had a great time. They have some unique menu items including spicy shrimp nachos, lobster nachos, etc. as well as some classic items such as regular nachos and tacos.  The waitstaff is friendly and eager to give you recommendations and advice on what to order. We went with the queso for an appetizer and their supreme nachos to share. Both were excellent. I had a house margarita, which was good but a little on the sweet side.  If you are feeling adventurous, they also offer a scorpion shot where you can shoot a baby scorpion in some tequila - or whatever liquor you choose. When in Vegas....you have to try something like this once...plus it makes a great photo opportunity. The scorpion will set you back about $9, on top of the shot - so not a cheap adventure, but how often do you have the opportunity to eat a scorpion?",

For appetizer we had the chips and guacamole, the guac tasted store bought rather than fresh so one star down.  The Golden Knights nachos were off the chain though, very good and not skimpy on the toppings.  The steak was moist and not dry.

I'm so HAPPY we went to Nacho Daddy's. The Service was amazing but the food was even better. I tried the Thai chicken nachos some of the best nachos I've ever had. My husband had the pork tacos and fillet mignon tacos both options are tasty. After having a horrible start to are vacation I can say Nacho daddy's turned are horrible day into a great night. Will definitely come back. As we left a group was going into the restaurant next door and my husband yelled your making the wrong choice and told them to try Nacho daddy's instead.

    "text": "Stumbled across this place from a recommendation by a bartender. Really awesome decor - music videos playing and some great tunes coming through. Place gets three stars due to it having a decent beer flight for only $9. Ordered the VGK Nachos - man are they disappointing. Small plate with Luke warm to almost cold toppings and cheese. For a place with Nacho in their title they don't do a very good job with nachos. Also ordered wings. Only two kinds...BBQ and Buffalo. No other sauces or types available. They were decent but only 8? Really. I might go back to try something else for the beer and music but avoid their so called signature dish - it's all HYPE! UPDATE!  Was contacted via email by Taylor Smith. At first she seemed genuinely concerned with the not great experience we had. But she only said \"we did get voted best wings by Insider\". Who cares??!! I'm talking to you about giving me 8 wings instead of 12 and charging me for them. They're not great!  She was not concerned with my experience and clearly is a HR/Mgmt flunkie charged with responding to reviews. She doesn't care what you say...the customer is always WRONG. Anyway, you should not order the nachos or the wings and tell the manager to stick it!",

Get beyond Ed Hardy facade and Nacho Daddy actually has a beautiful soul.  Yes they have Nachos, but there are many cheesy mexi options for your face. Everything from Spicy shrimp nachos to vegan quesadillas.  The portions would make Guy Feiri blush. Any place that can hold down a respectable greasy and delicious bar menu and still do a good job of creating delicious vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options deserves respect. But here is the kicker for every meal sold, they help feed less fortunate people in Vegas. Their slogan is \"Never a dry chip.\" Let me ad \"Or a dry eye.\" Keep doing the good work Nacho Daddy!",

I didn't even bother looking past the nacho section of the menu because they had so many cool options to choose from. The only thing that turned me off a little bit was the price, UNTIL I actually got my food and realized that for the quality and quantity it's totally worth it! I had no idea my nachos would be stacked so high. Pictures just don't do them justice. It's most definitely worth a stop, especially if you're a nacho fanatic like I am. You won't regret it.   There's some appetizer trio with salsa, guacamole, and queso that they light a little fire under to keep it all warm and melty. Oh my goodness. Quite possibly the best queso I've had. I would most definitely recommend it. Also, the white peach margarita is wonderful!   Definitely wishing this was a chain in Texas, but then again I doubt it would be this good if it was.",

Great atmosphere (lots of original MTV in the mix on the video screens for us baby boomers).  Staff is fantastic. We are here twice out of our 4 nights.  Serena was our server both times and you couldn't ask for better.  Also met Joseph the manager, who showed us some extra hospitality.  My wife and I had the Baja Seafood Combo. A fish taco with a crab and lobster enchilada.  Served with Mexican rice, re-fried beans and cherry tomato pico.   The great thing about Natcho Daddy is the price. It's on the strip, across from the Cosmopolitan and the Aria. It's next door to BW3, south of the Walgreens.  If your staying on the strip and can't afford $200 a night for dinner, this is a great alternative.  And they have a live scorpion!!!!",

    "text": "I was actually surprised bu this place, and to be fair, we may have just gotten lucky, as it seems like the kind of place you a 70/30 chance of getting it at the right time/group. We did, oddly enough it was a Friday night around 8pm and the place was pretty empty. A few tables here and there but you can tell this place was really designed to be packed and loud.  Glad it wasn't.  We started with margaritas, and I got the spicy cucumber margarita.  Boy oh boy.  I do love me some cucumber water, and I like spicy things, so those elements combined with a margarita and good booze?  Heck yea.  It was just ever so slightly too sweet, but I would get it again 10/10 times.  Just a little less sugar.  This place is obviously all about the nachos.  Though they have a TON of other options, lobster tacos, enchiladas, burritos, etc.  Obviously, I went for the nachos.  But with SO many to choose from how do you pick?  I could have gone for the classic guac and sour cream, or the extravagant loaded with this and that, but instead opted for Sloppy Joe nachos!  Yea.  Who doesn't love sloppy joes???  And nachos??  Right!?  So yea, this was a cool idea, and I had to try it.  Glad I did.  The sloppy joes were good, and the chips held up under the strain of seasoned and sauced ground beef, cheese, and the like.  I would be interested to try some other combos next time.  I think what I would do next time is have everyone order different nachos and then share them family style so you can try a bunch of them.  As it is the servings are large and I could not finish mine.  So a good ratio would be one nacho order per two people I think.  Everyone else complained that their drinks were all overly sweet and some chose not to finish drinking them at all.  Too bad.  The goblets they come serve in are large and about $14 each so seems a shame.  I would have asked for something else, or it to be remade less sweet.  But just a heads up if you tend to not like sweet drinks (I don't blame you).  I tried one and it was way too sweet.  I still stand by my spicy cucumber margarita as my top choice.  The service was good, and the place was nice.   Like I said YMMV but we got there at a good time on a good night and had fun. I don't know that I'd come back, as there are so many choices around Vegas, and I think this is a chain, so I'd avoid it maybe for that reason as well.  But if a group made the choice to go here, I know I would be able to find something I liked, no question.",

Can't go wrong with that, had a good amount of alcohol and was a great way to start the meal. The ambiance is perfect for groups with plenty of tv screens playing either sports or throwback hip hop songs. Now onto the food:   Filet Mignon Nachos - SO GOOD! The meat is very tender and everything about the taste was perfect. The only thing I would fix is maybe adding more chips since those ran out real quick and the portion size isn't the largest I've seen, but it's definitely quality over quantity here.   Thai Chicken Nachos - made with spinach chips, these were definitely not your average nachos. Wasn't a huge fan of these since the chicken was cut a bit larger so it was a bit harder to scoop.   Peach Margarita - got a pitcher of this and it poured 5 cups easily. Absolutely loved it and would recommend it to others.   Overall, I'd make another stop here the next time I'm in Vegas with some friends. The service was great, ambiance was chill, and paired with some delicious nachos means you're in for a good time.",

My wife and I had run out of ideas where to go for breakfast, looking at this place online we just didn't think it seemed like it would be a great spot but I thought Mexican for breakfast sounded good and we decided to give it a go, what a great idea. The yelp check in offer for a free margarita didn't hurt neither did the military discount. So we started our day around 830 with a margarita and some Thai Nachos. We were both very happy and the fact that so much of the menu was gluten free was awesome. You could order anything on the menu day or night. I went with the Huevos Rancheros and my wife had the Chicken and Kale Scramble. We were both glutenous and very pleased with our very full bellies.",

My order was lobster crab tacos (I subbed corn tortillas for flour) and the Supreme Tostada Nachos. Whatever sauce they put on those tacos, I wish I could take a jar of it home! The seafood was well done too. And the nachos were pretty darn tasty. Their homemade tortilla chips are perfect and the queso they use, yummmm! The Asst. GM stopped by my table to make sure everything was good, which always makes me smile   Although the location is slightest off the strip, it's easy to find. Just look for Buffalo Wild Wings next door. My advice to anyone considering visiting the Taco Bell Cantina (just a few doors down) is to swing the extra cost and step outside of the fast food box - and check this place out!!",

My husband and I visited  the establishment and had Huck as our server.  I saw another review that mentioned him...I can confirm he is excellent.  I was very impressed.    As consumers we take a chance when eating in restaurants.  We were watching a special on tv that highlighted  restaurants that was rodent infested.  I was disgusted and even more hesitant about eating out.  Then we meet Reuben and Oscar... the head Chef and assistant.  They were walking out and we stopped them to give compliments on the food.  They thanked us and what was more surprising ...invited us to tour the kitchen.  Keep in mind, I just watched the show so I really was hesitate about going. Well, the pride they take in what they do was shown in the cleanliness and organization of that kitchen and prep area.  Some faith restored...so impressed we ate there the next day and will tell everyone to visit when in Vegas.  Good job guys...continue to take pride in what you do!!!",

I was at the bar and saw multiple customers come in but there wasn't a hostess. So they left. After I drank my \"attempt at a michelada\" I was never asked if I wanted another drink. I ordered Buffalo chicken nachos, what I got was some nasty pile of stale tortilla child with sour cream and Buffalo chicken sauce that took 30 minutes to prepare. I do not recommend this place to anyone, and I'm not picky at all.",

Service was good too, my friends and I didn't wait long at all for the food to come. Our waiter was nice. They have plenty of vegan options, almost a whole page on the menu. And the prices were very reasonable, it has a wide range, so it fits all budget types. Location wasn't right on the strip which was good for me cause when it's right on the strip it tends to get really busy and crowded. However, it's not far off the strip either, it's about two hundred feet away so it's in walking distance and convenient as well.",

He reassured me the vegan Chik'n nachos were so good, I would seriously think I was eating meat.   He was SO right. Even a guy friend of mine who is a devout meat eater had to admit he enjoyed it. This review is actually 5 months later, because I'm back in Texas and I can't get my mind off of these bombbbb nachos. LOL",

I found this place after we watch the amazing jlo show and Las Vegas we were craving Mexican food as a vegan I thought my options would be limited. But boy was I wrong.  We arrived here around midnight we got seated right away I checked in to Yelp and got the free Margarita a For my husband. He said it was made just right .  I ordered from the vision menu the street of avocado  tacos and the vegan nachos. The tacos were delicious the of avocado is deep fried the toppings on top are just perfect with a little hint of lemon they are delicious. My husband stole one from me and he said that those tacos were better than his Buffalo wings that he had ordered . We sure the nachos which were a pile high and full of flavor and freshness. Definitely will be coming back here when I hit Vegas again.   Shout out to Harol (the guy with the hair) great service!",

I guess it's because they are about 100 yards off the strip; sort of at the corner of Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd by Buffalo Wild Wings.  We had a hard time finding it because the signs at the Miracle Mile shop showed it right by the Paris hotel but that is not correct.  The skinny margaritas we had were $12 each but very large and tasty.  The shrimp fajitas for two was huge and yummy.  The naked wings were also good and my 'Daddy Bowl' with quinoa and chicken was superb.  All of this food was high quality, reasonably priced and our server Jovanny was super friendly and attentive without being invasive.  Two drinks, an appetizer, shrimp fajitas for two, and the daddy bowl came to $77 after tax excluding tip.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and think if it had a location on the Strip, like where the not nearly as good Cabo Wabo is it'd be an hour wait for a table.",

Rachel was very helpful in deciding what to order from drinks to apps to meals. We settled on the queso and salsa for a start and the presentation was very unique and fun! They put a tea candle underneath the dip to keep it warm. This allowed them to have a higher cheese ratio because it never cooled down, making for a tremendous queso dip! Probably on the the best I have ever had. (And I make a great one at home)  For our main meal we had tacos, bowls, and burritos. The kids meals were plentiful and varied. The kids tacos were huge and my 9yr old could barely finish it. The adult pork tacos almost busted at the seems with the delicious shredded Carnitas. The unique chicken Thai tacos were sweet savory and spicy, and will be reordered when we go back again this trip. My wife had the Thai chicken bowl and it was similar to the tacos but varied enough to mention. With the corn in the bowl it added a sweetness that really complimented the dish. The beef burrito was so big my 12yr old son took half back to the hotel with him.  For drinks the house margaritas are wonderful. They aren't too sweet and you can still taste some of the tequila. Bonus points for being served in mason jars!  I have to reiterate that our server was the best part. She helped us order to be sure we didn't repeat thing were were getting like chips and salsa and queso. She was engaging, enthusiastic and charming. You could see how she cared about her customers happiness.  We asked when she was working because we will go back this trip to have the same experience!",

I'd give it 3.5/5 but if you're looking for something satisfying and a decent amount of food for the price I'd say give a shot.   They also offer some cheap margaritas to get your night (or afternoon) started",

Still, thankful for refuge from the chilly morning and away from crowds.  Or so we thought.  For some reason, the two large doors (think wide garage doors) on both floors were opened. This was around 11am and the temp was around 40 degrees. The entire restaurant was quickly  colder, forcing many patrons and some staff to put their jackets/coats/sweaters/scarves back on. WTF? And nobody was sitting outside or appeared to want to sit outside.   We were told by out waitress that a single person asked to have the doors opened so they were opened. Which, didn't make sense. So everyone else must suffer and have their hot food chilled? Why wouldn't they just go sit on the patio outside?  We didn't want to be a pain but it was getting to the point of possibly leaving before our food arrived which I didn't want to do. We pushed a bit more once our food arrived and she then said that the owner usually opens it when he arrives (he wasn't there yet) and she'll see what she can do to get it closed back up. They were closed about 5 minutes later and we all rejoiced. Actually, only the downstairs door was closed. About 15 minutes later, it was reopened and thankfully by then we were finishing up.  I get patio weather and wanting to draw in the crowds but it was FORTY DEGREES. Most everyone wanted to eat inside and the hottest part of the day had not hit yet. At the very least, please take the temperature into consideration - during the winter - before freezing out your customers.  Decent, affordable place to grab a bite but nothing I'd be rushing back to.",

    "text": "My fiance and I dined here on our most recent trip to Las Vegas.  We had been drinking for quite sometime and I needed some sustenance.  This place had some great reviews so we decided to check it out.  It is located on the far South corner of the MGM Grand.  Location is kind of weird.  I thought we were going to end up at the Tropicana.  We had to go out of the building to enter.  We arrived right as Happy Hour was getting started and they had some very reasonable prices for food anywhere, but Happy Hour made it an even better deal. They have a scorpion tank when you enter, which freaked me out, but the man thought it was cool.  Because we were there early, it was not loud or crowded, but I imagine if it were a different time of day it could be very loud and very crowded and it is a good size restaurant with lots of wide open space.   I checked in on Yelp and got a free house margarita.  The man ordered a house margarita on Happy Hour.  Margarita was solid for a house/happy hour special.   You do have to pay for the chips and salsa, but they are minimally priced and unlimited.  They have both a hot and mild sauce that they will bring to you.  They were good.   For food we ordered the pork tacos which I really loved.  The man liked them less so.  It isn't that he didn't like them, but he likes, \"American tacos\" with their hard shells, lettuce, tomato and sour cream .  These were pork tacos with hot sauce and queso fresca  He didn't like the soft flour tortilla (It's more authentic!).  He didn't like that the hot sauce was chilled and the pork was hot.  Essentially, everything I loved about it, he didn't care for.  I thought the sizzling hot pork with the chilled hot sauce was a gorgeous blend of hot and cold.  The queso fresca was awesome and they had limes that you could squeeze over the tacos to add that bit of acidity. We apparently just have very different tastes in tacos.   I really enjoyed the food here.  If you want authentic, hole in the wall Taqueria,  go to Tacos El Gordo, but if you want good food in a casual atmosphere with reasonable prices then this a solid bet.  I would come back.",

My husband and I shared it and we were both satisfied and not too full. As we were walking up we were handed coupons for free margaritas. They were excellent! Because we were on the strip we had drinks and had to finish them before we went in. As we finished our drinks we talked with the host for a bit. He was a very friendly young man named Jaylon. We decided to sit at the bar and our bartender Cassandra was very pleasant and attentive. As we were finishing our food Jaylon came in to see if we were enjoying the food. Not only did we get excellent service from start to finish but the food and drinks were really good and the prices were on point! Especially being on the Vegas Strip! Will definitely come back!",

So we waited at the bar and got some drinks. 20 minutes later the hostess called my phone from a whole 10 feet away to tell us our table was ready.  Once we were seated at our table, we waited 20 minutes for a server to show up.  No one ever did, although someone had the time to come by and pick up our menus, otherwise ignoring us. I finally went up to the hostess stand to ask them to send us a server. Except the hostess was outside talking to someone, so I had to ask a busser. The hostess finally came by and said she'd send a server over. We waited another 15 minutes and no one showed up. We finally decided to move back to the bar since we knew at least the bartender was working and could put in an order. Apparently prep work was more important than paying customers, because one of our party overheard her tell the barback she was too busy to take our order.  One hour of waiting later, we walked out.  We specifically came here because of the nachos and because it was local. So much for supporting a local business.",

We never lacked anything and I watched as he took care of several other tables and very missing a beat, he was the shit, simply said! The entire team worked together including the great friendly hosts, and expediter who was running food, also we had a chance to meet the manager Brian, who was truly the leader of the tribe who led by example bussing tables. I also met another manager  I can't remember her name, sorry but a cute dark haired female. The place was extremely busy and they didn't miss a beat, it was truly worth the wait. The food was awesome also, it was fresh tasting, came out hot and great portions. This was a great place to start a trip in Vegas the ambience was upbeat they had awesome music for all tastes and the restaurant was clean.

The chicken on top was fried chicken nuggets that were completely soggy. The entire plate was covered in Franks Red Hot (don't get me wrong franks is great but not alone on top of chips for $12.) Sad to say I was that person who sent it back. Our BBQ nachos were good but nothing I would come back for. The server was great and took off one of our drinks, which I can always appreciate good service. Maybe just drinks and a light snack is the way to go here.",

    "text": "For some asinine reason Yelpers in this town refer to themselves as las vegans making my search for a restaurant all the more painful than it usually is. Thankfully I stumbled upon Nacho Daddy which not only could accommodate a vegan diet but specializes in vegan dishes that are given almost the entirety of a page on their menu. I had the privilege of trying both the chick'n fajitas and the chick'n nachos which were both gargantuan dishes packed with a ton of flavor. Not to be outdone, their house margaritas are just as large and flavorful. I would definitely go with the Daddy Margarita because nothing will lubricate you for drinking more than thinking about your father. Also it's delicious.",

    "text": "As a new LV resident, and someone who works right near this location, I REALLY hoped this place would be awesome, but was really disappointed with the experience.  Brought my two buddies here, after assuring them it would be awesome based on the the reviews.  Saturday night, around 8 not too crowded.  We had a waitress, who though very nice, was largely absent after seating us. When our food order arrived, we spent about 5 minutes waiting (and later searching) for her because we had 1) no plates 2) no silverware 3) our food order was wrong.  When we explained that we ordered the nachos with no tomatoes or onions (which were all over the nachos), she asked if she wanted to send it back.  We explained that we don't WANT to send it back, but need to send it back because we had someone in the party who can't do those items, and she begrudgingly abliged.  No apology, nothing.  The first and only thing should have been an apology and an offer to replace, we were very clear in our order..  When we were eventually brought the plates, they were soaking wet, as if right out g the washer..  we had to wipe them all down.  The food was good, but the service just RUINED the experience- I am no longer, according to my buddies, allowed to pick where we go out to eat , that's how bad this was- damn!  Edit: 2nd time was much better.  Granted it was just me at the bar but the bar tender was very attentive and food was great.  I will come back and hopefully add another star (or 2)!",

Not a fan of neither red or green sauce, so can suggest one over the other.    Fiesta nachos were really good and what they say is True that not one chip was dry.  Also quantity was great and plentiful.   Service was also great.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Also the scorpion tank as you enter the restaurant was pretty cool to look at.",

Drinks: I was driving, so no adult beverages for me, but they had Coke Zero available, so 1 gold star to start. My wife had the Mexican Candy Margarita, it was a bit spicy for her liking, she liked the flavor, just a bit too hot.  Food: Spicy shrimp appetizer, a nice size portion, it was served in a cast Iron skillet, was very tasty.  For dinner we split the Supreme Tostada Nacho.  This was the star of the show. Just enough spice so you know it's there. Ground beef seasoned well, the refried beans were spot on. I have NO suggestions for improvement.   Service: Friendly and attentive.  **I used the restroom to wash my hands after digging in the pile of Nachos. There was blood on the floor in the restroom, I brought it to the server's attention, hopefully they cleaned it quickly.  I do have ONE suggestion - Open a Nacho Daddy in the Phoenix area---PLEASE !",

    "text": "Boooooooooo. One of my favorite dishes is nachos, so I was super excited to find a place called NACHO DADDY!!!  Great name, classic, reliable dish almost everywhere.  We ordered the BBQ pork nachos...  how in the world could a place called NACHO DADDY not have bomb-ass nachos???    Chips, star of the show, are bland and not crispy-Chipotle chips are way better. Even Tostitos are more palatable.   \"Never a Dry Chip\" is the motto...  even printed on their nacho box.  Most of our chips were dry actually. There was a thick layer of pasty pork bbq, but underneath that rug was just bland, plain 'ole chips.    Now let's talk about the cheese. WTFuuuuuuhhhhhh???!!!!  It congeals like processed American cheese or Velveeta cheese.  Remember that slick plastic-y texture you achieved when microwaved American singles on chips as a kid??!  If not, this will jog your memory, but with a much higher price tag.    Chips + Cheese = Nachos  simple recipe, not calculus y'all!   The disappointment here is mind-blowing. It's suuuuuch a simple dish .  I'm just so mad at Nacho Daddy for funking it up so bad.   I'll end with something positive...  the grilled corn off the cob was pretty good.  But, again, the place is called NACHO DADDY, not Daddy's Grilled Corn.   If Nacho Mama is out there, please please please knock some sense into Nacho Daddy.  I think he may have forgotten the recipe for his core dish.  Glad to hear you will pass along the feedback, Taylor. How about a refund?!",

    "text": "Oh my nachos. I had been drinking, and I'm sure most of their customers have also been down the same alley leading up to this point in the night.   The check in deal on Yelp was a huge plus for a free house margarita, the cool server that everyone talks about, Jovanny, even let my wife and I have one each for checking in. He then forgot them and we had to ask again, all the sudden he brought out 4. (There was a table of 10 of us so we shared) Great customer service by him for not even making a big mistake it wasn't 2 minutes later than the rest of the drinks.  With such a large group I anticipated not only a wait to be seated, then a long wait for food. This wasn't the case at all, actually the place was pretty dead for a Friday night. We were seated immediately and had food and drinks quickly. I'm surprised there weren't more customers as I'd definitely return if I lived nearby.  I had just a standard nacho with beef, cheese, avocado, sour cream, etc. just your normal nacho. The amount of ground beef was ample, and they really built this nacho up. They didn't do the stack of chips then toppings, it was mixed in sporadically. The amount of real cheese, then also a nice nacho cheese made this wonderful.  I was very surprised to find that even by the end the nachos were not soggy, everything was still crisp and firm!  One nacho is enough to share for kind of a drunk meal to top off the night, most in our party got their own and did not finish, or get remotely close.  Only downside is someone in our party ordered wings. He absolutely hated them and thought they were horrible. He shared with several people at our table and no one was fond of them. He did tell our server and since he shared them it was no longer valid to be refunded. We weren't really bent on the refund, but what a silly policy. Over half still there and since he shared them he couldn't even get a discount. I didn't stop hearing about the wings all weekend. Bummer.",

During my most recent trip we ordered the Fiesta Nachos, which come with grilled chicken tenders, salsa, onions, beans, cheese, queso, pico, guac, and sour cream.  Soooo good!  Even though they had a ton of toppings, the chips stayed crisp.  For my meal I went with the chicken tacos.  I was a little disappointed in these.  Everything inside the tacos were good, but the shell was super heavy.  The soft shell tasted more like a gordita or something other than the traditional soft taco shell.  It was still good though.  Make sure to do one of the scorpion shots!",

All of the nachos there look good, but I have the feeling the Filet is the best. Lot's of steak and toppings, so each chip was full. For breakfast, we had the breakfast burrito (was ok) and the Chilaquiles, which were delicious and so packed with chicken I could not even finish them. The beans are flavorful and the sauces are great - but some dishes like the enchaladas go a little overboard on the sauce. The service and food has always been great when we go there, and the awesome 80's music and MTV videos are fun to watch.",

My co-worker had the lobster tacos on freshly homemade tortillas, and those were even better. I wish I had ordered those.  Negative points for telling me 15 minute wait, and making us wait 45. The place is also very \"sticky.\" It is popular, crowded with young folks, and quite frankly pretty dirty. All those sweet cocktails spilling all over the place has your feet sticking to the floor.  Really good food, aight service, crowded, dirty ambiance.  4 stars.",

Bloody Mary stole the show and was spicy the way we like. Steak omelette was decent, not the best I've had, husband said chilaquiles were good. Enormous portions for a great price $11. I would probably just stick to the nachos which looked delicious but we didn't order since it was sorta early.",

Checked into here on Yelp and got offered a free house margarita - which was already a good start. It made it even better that the margarita was actually good ! Because let's just be real, some places just don't know how to make good drinks but Nacho Daddy is not one of those places . Our server was amazing & very attentive. And the food....the food unexpectedly hit the spot. I usually don't order enchiladas anywhere because it never tastes \"authentic\" enough for me , and although this restaurant didn't exactly make them authentic either, It was the best enchiladas I had from a restaurant in a long time . Inside the restaurant is pretty small but very family friendly. This was my first time in Vegas and If I ever go back, I would definitely go eat at Nacho Daddy again.",

They have loud music playing inside and there's a lot of video monitors everywhere which makes for sensory overload.  I ordered the Vegan Fully Loaded Nachos with water which was good. The guacamole was very good and I really liked the proportions and the way the cheese was spread throughout the nachos. A lot of places simply put the cheese on top and then the chips on the bottom don't get any cheese. That wasn't an issue last night so kudos there.  My biggest qualm was based on other complaints that being the cheese. You can tell it's real cheese because real cheese gets stringy. This cheese is more like Velveeta. It's kind of soft and mushy, nothing stringy about it at all. That was the reason I knocked a star off, and keeps this place from being great. If you're gonna make nachos you can't skimp on the cheese and that's exactly what they've done. The Vegan Nachos weren't cheap either at all, around $15 for my plate.   I've definitely had better nachos but I can see how younger folk would totally dig the ambience here.",

The Nacho Daddy restaurant is open until 2 a.m. on weekdays and 3 a.m. on weekends. And in recognition of and early-risers looking for breakfast options, it opens at 8 a.m. and serves breakfast all day.  Amid all the publicity and visibility of this new location, Nacho Daddy's unique menu and awesome customer service is the foundation of its success. Nacho Daddy has a commissary in Las Vegas that continuously delivers fresh ingredients to their restaurants throughout the day. By upgrading ingredients, like using filet mignon in their street tacos, adding lobster to the menu and offering a popular vegan nacho, the restaurant owners want to make sure Nacho Daddy continues to emphasize substance over style.  I really enjoyed their chicken enchilada and pork taco combo. The taco shell is a really well and made thick shell that has a bit of crunch to it but is also foldable. It's served on a hot cast iron skillet with perfectly cooked beans and rice and garnished with sliced fresh cherry tomatoes.  I'll be back!",

The restaurant has a huge logo in front so you can't miss it at all!  Their service was great! We really liked our server (too bad I forgot his name. Boo) cause his personality was pretty awesome- you can tell he enjoys his job and makes sure you're taken cared of. Their house margarita- just wow! Even my aunt who is very particular about margaritas said it was really good with just one sip. Kinda expensive cause they put a lot of ice in it so a pitcher is only good for about 4 glasses but hey, that's good margarita though. ;)  We tried their nachos, flaming shrimp, fish tacos and burritos, and all were amazingly delicious! Their taco shell isn't just an ordinary kind of shell too, it's this really crunchy and tasty thing like some sort of heaven in your mouth kind of thing. :) I mean we just enjoyed every single thing we ate- even their salsa was good.   Overall, this place is pricier compared to other restaurants that have the same theme but their unique food makes it worthy of trying. I actaully can't wait to go back for more!",

There is outdoor sitting available.  2. The food portions are HUGE. You could easily share one nacho with two people.   3. The food is good too. I had the nacho and it was not only filling but very tasty.  4. There is a free house margarita coupon if you check in. You can also get any margarita with $8.95 discount if you use your check-in.   5. The service is very nice. Our waitress was very kind and warm. As well as any other employee who greeted us and sat us down.  6. The prices are good for Vegas. In Vegas, everything is expensive. For the taste and amount, the prices are very good here. Nachos are anywhere from $15-23 bucks.  I would definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas. The food was great, the service was good, and the environment was very nice. Prices are hard to beat for Vegas. Would come again.",

As my earlier review will show, I was not too impressed the first time I visited but, with vegan friends, options are a bit limited as to where we can eat.  Because of this, we have found ourselves at Nacho Daddy a few times. The second time I went (following my original Yelp review), I tried their Vegan Chick'n Chimichanga and I was thrilled.  Their vegan chicken tastes, looks, and feels so much like real chicken (BUT BETTER) that I had to ask to verify I wasn't eating actual chicken.   Since then, I've also tried their Vegan Daddy's Bowl.  I will continue to go to Nacho Daddy because their vegan options are, in my opinion, unbeatable and way better than their non-vegan options. My only complaint that remains is that on busy evenings (just following Happy Hour), their service can be a little slow.  Other than that, their vegan menu quickly made me a fan.",

Definitely share because they give a lot (unless you're like me and can finish a whole one myself..). They definitely don't skimp out of the toppings. The menu was right to say \"never a dry chip\". My enchilada nacho was filled with so much chicken breast. The meat was tender and flavorful from the enchilada sauce. There was plenty of cheese and bean as well.   Most of the tacos if you get them a la carte are 3 tacos for around $10-12 dollars. The fish tacos were delicious while the chicken taco was pretty standard tasting but still yummy.   Chicken wings were meh to me. It wasn't good but wasn't bad either. I don't think it's really worth ordering.   Definitely need to come back to try all the different nachos!",

The bartender didn't seem to want to be there and left half way through our dinner so we got a new bartender which was a lot more attentive.   For food we got a couple different nachos and split them all. We got the buffalo chicken nachos, pulled pork nachos, and fiesta nachos. The buffalo chicken nachos good, but very heavy on the sauce. The pulled pork nachos were extremely good and more than enough for 2 people! The fiesta nachos had a nice kick to them as well.   There was a nice large menu of margaritas to choose from. We got the Cadillac margarita and it was on the sweeter side. Not too bad, but maybe a little too much triple sec.",

We got the Thai Chicken Nachos which had an amazing sweet chili sauce on it that mixed well with the melted cheese.   We also got the Mexican Candy Margarita and it was spicy and great and tasted just like a Tamarindo candy. If you're sensitive to spicy you may not like it. I thought it was a good amount of spicy just for sipping but I couldn't down it in a thirst quenching way cuz it was too spicy for that.  Then we ended with the Caramel Apple Nachos and they were to die for. It was the perfect mix of sweetness from the ice cream, cinnamon and sugar from the crisp but airy chips and freshness from the apples. Yum, yum yum!  I'd recommend ordering each of those items.",

We got the nacho average nachos to start and we each got chicken enchiladas. The food was amazing-the best nachos I've ever had. The chicken enchiladas were really good as well. I got the yelp free margarita with a flavor for a bit extra and he got the margarita with the corona on top. We both loved our drinks. The service, food, and drinks were excellent!  We came a second time for happy hour. We got the bbq chicken nachos, which were tasty but not half as good as the nacho average. We also got Bangkok chicken tacos and the chimichangas. The chimichangas were my fav. Happy hour drinks were also very good.   Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "First off, I appreciate that they had their own \"vegan\" page on the menu, makes my life easier. I wish I could've tried everything on the menu that was vegan, but I had the quesadilla, and the chocolate cake.  I give the quesadilla a 6/10, because the cheese could've been made with a vegan mozzarella to keep it more together, but instead it was made with a nacho type of cheese, which made it a bit soggy and drippy. Maybe that's the theme, not sure. It was still great with the guacamole, pico, and 'sour cream' that came with it. The chocolate vegan cake- 8/10, if you love rich sweet chocolate then you would love it. I took mine to go and with every bite I had to drink some coffee to wash it all down. Overall I would definitely go back and try the many different things they had available for vegans. Thank you nacho daddy! We need one of these in Houston",

However, we were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was for me to order and I was elated by how delicious it was. I'm not one to eat large meals at dinner, so when I nearly finished the whole thing... it was a sign. Oh, he liked his food too - so you don't have to be vegan to appreciate this place.

I am somewhat skeptical of margaritas that are made very big because they will be very sugary unless they have a decent amount of tequila or other alcohol.  This one had way too much sugary mix and tasted like it had no liquor in it.  Perhaps it depends on the bartender.  Atmosphere is ok.  I don't quite get the open kitchen that isn't anything to look at.  It seems like the kitchen area wasn't intended for the restaurant to see and therefore should have been closed off by a wall.",

    "text": "Vegan menu is cool, ambiance is what you expect, but in a good way, and service is great most times.  The menu satisfies most of my friends who have ordered items I have not yet had.  I mainly eat vegan options and it is nice to have healthier options.  However, it's a bummer when some of the dishes are delicious and others lacking in comparison.  The hours are convenient for those who want to daytime dine or eat late at night.  I enjoy drinking here and they have a decent selection.  Overall I like this establishment.       I'd like to say that Vince on day shift is very professional, amiable, prompt and genuine.  He deserves whatever schedule he wants and should get a raise.  Make him an assistant manager or manager and have him teach some others on customer service!  I rarely sit at tables.  Preferring the bar because servers usually are lacking.  Not Vince!  He's on it!  Makes ya feel at home and I'd hope he'll be working I'd come by more often.  Never misses the opportunity to ask us if there is anything else he can do.  Knowledgeable on dishes, always suggesting more based on what we ordered without pushing it.  If nacho daddy had more employees like him.  You'd make more profit for sure.  He and Rene took care of the birthday boy's cake and just really made our day exceptionally much more enjoyable.  Ashley the bartender on the late shift was great as well.  She was quick and easy to order from.       I wanna mention that more often than not, the hostesses that seat ya have some pretty bad attitudes and are not professional.  Any questions asked by patrons to clarify leads to shitty rude faces and responses coming from them.  About 9 times I've had only bad experiences with the some of those hostesses.  I don't wanna generalize because some are lovely and helpful.  Again Vince saved the day on more than one occasion.      I would like some more authentic dishes overall but for what it is, it's pretty great.  I don't see much difference in service between the shifts, and frequently, I'm glad most times.  If they can have a spicier option for some salsas or peppers would be a welcomed addition.  The Vegan Chocolate Cake was one of the best I've ever had.  Guacamole and Chips were great, I personally like my guac with more lime and spice xD.  Vegan Chick n Quesadilla, Vegan Chicken Nachos, Chicken Chimichanga Vegan were all delicious also.  I'm going to be a regular here forsure, just wish they had local deals.",

The chicken was seasoned really nicely but everything else about it was average. I'm kind of a cheese snob so I expect a Mexican restaurant to not use cheddar on any of their dishes but that's just a personal preference. Maybe if they threw some queso fresco on their salad and I had a few of their margaritas I would be more in love with it.  Price wise it's a little expensive for what you get but considering it's a very touristy area I think they are priced about right.  The bar tender was very attentive, 5 stars for the service. My water was empty a lot, but between the combination of her being SUPER busy and me being SUPER thirsty, it's nothing to get upset over.  If I'm in town again I would maybe come back for a marg and an app, but nothing to write home about considering all the amazing restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "3.5 because at the end of the day, it's about the food.  First, let me say that as ridiculous as it sounds, finding good nachos in a restaurant is incredibly hard to find.  You wouldn't think chips, cheese, and some toppings wouldn't be hard to make well.  But I've had so many disappointments that I gave up ordering nachos.  Then comes along a news article that listed this place as one of the best in the country.  Being a nacho lover, I had to try it.  It's not easy to get to once you get into the Miracle Mile shops if youre a lazy oaf like me.  But at least the journey builds up your appetite.  Food:  I just read a review from 2 days prior about the Lobster Crab Nachos.  It's one of the more pricey items on the menu.  The review wasn't glowing.  After talking to the bartender, I decided to try it since he said they pride themselves on happy customers and I could ship it back if I was dissatisfied.  Can't turn that down so I got em.  Basically it tastes just as you would imagine Las Vegas strip lobster nachos would taste.  It wouldn't surprise me if the crab came out of the jar I see at Costco.  I took a bite of just the meat itself and it was tasteless except for the sauce.  The lobster meat was a bit better.  Kinda like what you get in a lobster roll.  If you want lobster for $25, I would rather get a lobster roll than this.  But I got it for the novelty if trying it once.  And I wasn't hungry.  So I didnt want to be a jerk and ship it back.  Service: 4 stars.  When i came in, I was ignored at first and another couple who sat down was immediately tended to.  But then I got service.  The guy helping me was very informative and pleasant.   I came when it was nearly empty so that helped a great deal.  I suspect the negative service reviews are from people who came in at dinner time.  He said he covers 32 bar seats and 250 dining seats.  Thats a lot of work for a couple of people.  I'll come back to try the filet mignon nachos.   But be smart and don't let your hopes and imagination run wild hoping for unforgettable nachos from the lobster crab one.",

The menu, the pictures, the reviews, it sold my friends and I!  The reviews are True. You have to try the nachos. We got the Burger Nachos and breakfast burrito and it sure was delicious. The portion of the nachos are huge, so definitely something to split. You also can't beat the free margarita with a Yelp check in!!   We got here around 2pm on a Saturday and it was packed. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, but it was worth it I promise! Service was great as well.",

It is a neat atmosphere but was a bit loud (at least around dinner time). The service was good and we happily redeemed our (small) free margarita which was reported really good.  The two non vegans in our party thoroughly enjoyed their food. They liked the street tacos with filet mignon and the fajitas.  As for their whole page of vegan options, we tried the spicy burrito, the vegan nachos, the tacos with avocado, and the vegan quesadilla. Everything was fabulous, but the quesadilla which, while still good, was a bit too saucy.  The portions were perfect- not too big or small. The nachos, however, were huge and could be easily split by two in my opinion.",

When we arrived, there was a 20-30 minute wait so we went to the bar and ordered a pitcher of \"Daddy's Margarita\" and they were probably the best I've had in any restaurant ever!  We sat on the patio and had the \"Golden Knights\" Nachos, which are the Filet Mignon nacho's with extra spicy peppers and queso...delish!  We also got the ceviche, which was good too. Overall, we had a great dinner and recommend you stop by for some amazing Nachos! #nachodaddy",

Our server Vince was very helpful and attentive. The Assistant General Manager also seemed very supportive of his staff when they seemed to get slammed with a lot of customers. I know this because I stopped the AGM to inform him of a small piece of tortilla chip that was inside of my friend's beer flight. He immediately replaced a new one for us.   The Filet Mignon Nachos were amazing. The steak was very tender, and complemented the nachos very well!  Me and my friend just wanted to share those nachos, and it was the perfect size.   If you want to grab a couple brews, and something to snack on, try Nacho Daddy! Overall, great service, great food, and great selections on beers. Our favorite was the House Hefeweizen.   The location of this place is on the outer edge of PH. It neighbors BWW.   Cheers!",

This place is great. Ambiance is fun and comfortable. Nachos are as good as advertised. We asked our waitress about the fish tacos, and she made a recommendation of how many we should order considering the size of our group. We thought she was up-selling us, so we ordered less, but we regret this decision.   FISH TACOS ARE BOMB! ORDER EXTRA!  We ordered a lot of food, and then some more food, and then tequila shots.

Coming back to Vegas April 2019 I made it a point to get Nacho Daddy my first night there. As always, the service was excellent (I think our server's name was Mark with a beard. It's been a week, sorry!). Unfortunately, the food just wasn't the same and I ran into some cleanliness issues as well.  We ordered: **Free house margarita with check in per person!!** * Lobster & Crab Nacho - The moment our server set down the order, my boyfriend and I knew it was going to be a different experience. The cheese was only in the middle with the toppings towards one side of the plate. Compared to my previous experience, everything was spread out evenly. Cheese between the chips and surplus amount of lobster and crab spread out. This time, I couldnt tell the difference between crab and lobster.. it just wasn't as good. * Cali Buritto - As simple as it gets. Too simple? Cheese, meat, some fries. The order came with chips which was nice. The burrito got cold quickly. We finished neither orders :/ * White Peach Margarita + Blood Orange Margarita - The margaritas were great! At first we thought it tasted like juice, but the drinks were quite strong and we got a good buzz out of them. Available to go too!  Later in our meal I used a napkin to wipe my mouth. I folded the napkin in half after to find that there were orange stains and writing on it. I reported this to the server and the manager assisted us with the issue. As a kind gesture the manager offered to comp our margaritas. We really appreciated this.  Because of the good will gesture I solely rated this restaurant based on their food.",

Seriously, I feel like they had to try really hard to have bland, flavorless food across the board. Service wasn't great, the menu was covered in some crusty substance, and the food was affirmatively bad.   But, the beer (in a bottle) was good and I didn't get food poisoning, so they earn a star for that. And a star for having vegan options (even if the vegan options are completely tasteless).   Def would never come back and would tell people not to go.",

The burger nachos was delicious, the favor kind of reminded me of a better version of Taco Bell. I also ordered a cheese quesadilla for my toddler, it was huge!!! I enjoyed some of that as well, the tortilla was really good! The menu is rather extensive, everything looked really good. I'd like to come back sometime and try their queso and other nachos. The waitstaff was very nice and helpful as well, and the food came out fast!",

I will definitely visit this place again if we ever go back to Vegas.  We were down here for a conference, We generally vacation in slow relaxing places, like Napa Valley.",

Lol. We walked quite a ways from our hotel and they were pretty busy, but luckily our wait wasn't long at all.  I forgot to take a picture of the margarita, but it was their house margarita and it was very good! For food, we started with the Triple Dip, which comes with salsa, guacamole, and queso. I was pretty impressed with everything! Not the best queso I've ever had, but I definitely enjoyed it and the guacamole, too. I didn't eat as much salsa because I was focused on the other things ;)   For lunch, my boyfriend had the Fajita Nachos, which he really enjoyed! I didn't taste any myself, but they looked really good and definitely weren't lacking on toppings haha. We'd both recommend sharing them, though - he got about halfway through and couldn't finish, and nachos don't save all that well lol. I was full from all the queso, so I just had the Southwest Chimichanga, which I loved. It's definitely more like a Mexican egg roll than a chimi in my opinion, but I really liked it. The dipping sauce was delish, too :)",

It wasn't so bad considering it was prime time Saturday night on the Vegas strip!   We were greeted with friendly smiles by everyone on staff. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The refilling of water kept coming. The nachos were excellent. I had a bowl instead of the nachos, but I was able to sample the nachos that my dining buddies ordered. The food came out pretty fast considering the crowded restaurant.  I would come here again because the food was delicious, the service was excellent, and you can't beat the price point! Just call ahead next time for reservations before heading there.",

It's lively but not crowded (we went on Thursday and Saturday nights), and the service is great. Both waitresses were really kind and helpful. Chips and salsa, or the dip trio, are great salsa. Be aware, the hot salsa is REALLY hot. For mains, of course nacho dishes! If you're really really hungry, you can consider splitting 2 dishes for 3 people, otherwise 1 dish every 2 people is more than plenty (especially if you've had the dip trio first). Good choice of beverages. I would definitively go back next time we're in Vegas.",

Also we got free margaritas for our first checkin! Never too early for a drink when in Vegas. I ordered a sausage breakfast burrito and it was so filling. Thick and stacked burrito that definitely hit the spot! Overall first experience here was awesome. Give nacho daddy a try, I'm sure you can find something to hit the spot off their menu!",

Based on their logo and layout of the restaurant, I thought this was a chain restaurant.  Actually, there are three locations, two in Vegas, and one elsewhere in Nevada. It has a sports bar vibe to it with all the TVs playing various games or music videos.    When it comes to the food, all I have to say is GET THE NACHOS! I failed to mention that I went here twice during my weekend vacation because the nachos were that good! I would recommend bring a friend with you because there's no way you can finish this on your own...I did get close the first time.  There are other food items such as tacos...and that's all I can remember because I was so engulfed with the nachos.  You can get your traditional type nachos, but they had some other fun flavors to try.  First time I went with the BBQ chicken, and the second time BBQ pork.  Okay so I might be addicted to BBQ, but the sauce was so sweet and combined with the melted cheese, and crispy chips...I was in food coma heaven.   Service was spot on both times.  I sat at the bar and a table.  The servers were quick and helpful as I always like hearing their recommendations.  A big plus is the current Yelp check-in offer is a house margarita!  One it was super delicious, but also there was no issue with using the check-in offer.  Not too many businesses in WI utilizes this tool, so a lot of staff are usually confused when I show it.  I was happy that wasn't a problem.  I would have no problem with Nacho Daddy expanding with more locations...like Wisconsin.",

The portions are huge and tasty and staff was pleasant as always.",

Sooo good! My wife and I had a drink, shared a supreme tostado nacho and a Carmel apple dessert nacho! It was perfect. What we really liked was that the waiter actually recommended some thing and not others...made us feel like our waiter, Ryan, knew what he was talking about and actually ate here. I hate it when a server says \"everything is good\"...that is not informative. I would highly recommend and we will be back! Delicious and such a great deal for the amount of food and beverage you get!",

The coffee is a allstar as it comes in a French press. Service was also spectacular. Great breakfast spot!",

I am blind as a bat, the address is correct, I had the MGM grand on the wrong corner, good thing my taste buds are working, the food and service are great.  Note, they moved last year and the Yelp address is incorrect, so if your not looking you will never find it.  Order the Buffalo Hot Nachos, popcorn chicken with hot sauce and the Mojo Pork Tamale, did not take long to get my food and it looks delicious.  The service is great, maybe because I am by myself or that I sat close to the kitchen, my favorite spot in any restaurant, but I am definitely not being ignored.  The tamale is fabulous, lots of meat, the mojo is so good, and the masa is light and not doughy like in some tamale I have had.  I would say it is definitely worth searching out when you come to Vagas. I am only holding back one star because they are hard to find.  Ok, I tried the nachos, they get the 5th star.",

We ordered the special nachos for the month (chimichanga) as well as the chicken tinga nacho. Both were really good, but I preferred the chicken tinga because of the chipotle tinga sauce they covered the nachos. It was super tangy and unique. The chicken quesadilla was a miss with our group. It just wasn't cheesy enough and tasted pretty plain. I would just stick with the nachos, and there's so many different ones to try! It's a fun atmosphere to come here with a big group of friends with all their shareable dishes.   Tip: if you check in on yelp, you get a free house margarita!!",

Nacho Daddy is not authentic Mexican but I still like it. There's good specials and they accommodate many dietary restrictions.   I was encouraged to try this by some new friends. They said it's their favorite, and what did I know about it? This place is great for vegetarians. It has so much to choose from. The food isn't cheap but it's not excessively expensively like some other places on the Strip. By checking in here you get a free margarita. That itself was good enough for me, but the food was good too. I got a vegetarian burrito. It's about $10 and comes with tortilla chips. This thing was filled to the max. Many times vegetarian burritos won't fill me up because they're so light. They stuffed this with beans, rice, and vegetables. Others I came with got burritos with beef or chicken, and beef and vegetarian tacos. They all looked as good as mine, and I think I should get tacos next time. It also has nachos of course. These also can be made vegetarian friendly.   It was better than going to Chipotle. It wasn't that much of a price difference either. The ingredients are higher quality and have much better taste.",

This Nacho Daddy location is in a hectic area just off the Strip. The interior is modern sports bar-esque, with lots of huge TVs playing music videos. The place is huge but wildly popular, so expect a 30+ minute wait for a table. The hostesses and servers were all very sweet and efficient.   As the restaurant's name may suggest, the nachos here are incredible. We all loved the Vegan Loaded Nachos, which are completely smothered in rich, gooey cheese sauce that no one would know is vegan. The pico de gallo, salsa verde, and guacamole on top all tasted fresh and well spiced. For my entree I got the Vegan Fajita Salad, which was simple and satisfying, with seasoned Beyond Chicken strips atop fresh greens and grilled onions.   The Pineapple Mint Margarita was candy sweet and tasted artificially flavored, so I switched drinks with my boyfriend who got a Cadillac Margarita. This was slightly better, but still too sweet and did not have enough tequila considering the huge goblet size of the drink. While nothing amazed me aside from the nachos, I appreciate the inclusion of vegan options and would not hesitate to recommend.",

You can easily share one nacho plate - and this was just the best!  Spicy, cheesy and the right combination of cheese, guacamole and pico.   We ate on a busy Saturday afternoon and waited about 20 minutes for our table. The only negative I have is that the music was loud, so we had to raise our voices to hear each other.",

It's got a ton of TVs with the games on or weird and entertaining music videos playing- gives you something to stare at when you're hungover af and waiting on your huge pile of nachos. Service was as good as it was gonna get given it was labor day weekend. Our waitress, I think her name was Carly, hustled so I dont have complaints. Menu is large with more than just nachos so there is something for everyone. Drinks are good too. Filet mignon nachos are hella good. I got the chicken tinga nachos last time.",

The atmosphere was very nice, and they had great music playing the whole time. The chicken tinga nachos were bomb and the portion was a lot bigger than we had expected. The chicken quesadilla was also really! really! good! Service was great and our waiter Kylo Ren (that's what his name tag said!) was super attentive . Overall a great experience and will definitely be back when in Vegas! (PS. You get a free margarita when checking in with purchase of an entree!)",

The spicy nachos were a flavorful surprise, piled high with tender grilled shrimp, cheese sauce,  spicy salsa and guacamole.   The servers were excellent and knowledgeable and the overall vibe of the place was low key chill. Kristina, the bartender was wonderful and made us some really great margaritas.

We scored a great table in the bar next to the scorpion tank,  which had me apprehensive at first, but I was assured by the wait staff that the scorpions pretty much hide out under the rocks in the tank and never have they gotten loose! Enjoyed the happy hour menu with a great selection of nachos and tacos. The shrimp tacos were super tasty with fresh ingredients and the nachos, which is there specialty, were dripping with toppings. Everything on happy hour is five bucks which is great for Vegas. Don't miss this hot spot!",

The chips weren't bad but they definitely are not home made from scratch. The toppings ratio to chip ratio was good. And the cheese wasn't bad. But nothing really stood out. Not mad I had it but wouldn't be a high recommendation either.   The positives are good location, friendly staff, cool vibe. If your looking for a place to have some drinks in the heart of it all and also have some nachos maybe this is your spot. But we weren't drinking and we were not impressed. We definitely have a bunch of better nachos spots in CT.",

I also got to see someone do the shot of tequila with the scorpion in it. The scorpion is dead (thank God) and it is soaked in liquor. They serve it on top of a lime on the shot glass. The waitress rings a bell as the shot is being done. This is not my type of thing LOL, but it was great for the tourists that we took there.",

The beans taste like they came from a can and the rice like it came from a rice box from the grocery store. My daughter enjoyed her sliders but could care less for the fries.",

    "text": "The filet mignon nachos were bomb! We also had the crab and lobster nachos but I didn't enjoy those as much.  There's also a yelp check in deal here to get a free margarita with purchase of an entree, and they didn't limit us. It was per entree basically, so two entree's, two  margaritas.  We also got a free birthday dessert, and since it was Tuesday, it was also BOGO Tequila shots! Our server was even awesome enough to let us buy it for him and his colleagues, so we all took shots together. All in all, a fun experience with the people of Las Vegas.  I would gladly come back again for some more filet mignon nachos. We were at Top Golf earlier this trip and had their nachos, they weren't horrible, but Nacho Daddy's were far better (and they better be with this kind of name...).",

We went on a slow (for Vegas) day, and service was a bit lacking as our waitress disappeared for at least 20 minutes. Perhaps she was on break, but nobody else checked on us and we sat with empty drinks almost the entire time we were eating. Drinks were also a bit watered down, but drinkable. Food was great though. I had a breakfast scramble and hubby had loaded nachos and we both cleaned our plates. We'll be back next time we're in town!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place since vegan nachos and quesadillas are extremely rare finds. They offer an entire vegan menu, including a dessert option, which is great. However, overall the food is really bland and flavorless. Let's start with appetizers. We asked for the \"spicy\" salsa, which was basically milder than mild salsa. Nothing spicy about it. The guacamole also had no flavor at all and the portion is small for what you're paying for. On a side note, it's a little obnoxious that the chips and salsa are not complimentary, which is pretty standard for Mexican restaurants. Moving on to entrees, the chick'n quesadilla was underwhelming. The vegan queso was okay, but, again, bland. I like that they offer faux meat and that gave the quesadilla more flavor and texture. However, it needs a little more. I actually liked the loaded vegan nachos. They were covered with a semi-spicy salsa, which was the first sign of flavor of the night (why didn't it come with the chips?). I would order those again. I must give Nacho Daddy props for its vegan chocolate cake. It was so delicious! Very rich, heavy on the frosting, and had a layer of Oreo crust (genius). My takeaway for vegans is that you shouldn't get your hopes up, but the chocolate cake is worth trying.",

The churro sundae was good as well although the churro got hard possibly due to the ice cream but it was still worth it!",

And the nachos were everything you want: crunchy chips, cheesy,  and piled high with all the fixings.   My margarita was delicious. It was a pineapple mint margarita on the rocks with a sugar rim. It wasn't overly sweet and it got the job done.   If I go back, I will order the fish tacos. I had a bite of my friends and the fish was so crunchy! There was no \"fishy\" flavor, just delicious, crunchiness. And the fish was not overly battered so you could taste the fish.",

Someone suggested this place and we were able to get 12+ people sat at a table within a half hour around 7pm. Not bad at all.  The atmosphere was good and the staff was friendly. Make sure you check in on Yelp and get your free margarita! That was a nice perk that we did not notice until we had ordered a pitcher of margaritas, so we just indulged a little more haha.  We shared the guac and chips which was really good and a good portion. My wife got the pork tacos. They were good, nothing special, but they were not very expensive and she enjoyed them. I had the the enchilada trio and it was very tasty! I let a few other people try them and they were the consensus best meal of the table.   Good place to go in Vegas for some decent food and they can accommodate a decent sized party of people.",

I would like to thank Nacho Daddy for their large vegan menu! There were a lot of really great options. We had the sweetest waitress, Ryan. She was great!  She let us know that her favs off the vegan menu were the Loaded Nachos and the Spicy Burrito. Done and done! When the order came, it looked SO good... we dug right in. A few bites in, I was questioning my entire life. I'm always such a paranoid freak when it comes to eating vegan at a non-vegan restaurant because people are humans and mistakes happen, but I'm not trying to realize it at the end of the meal. I had to ask Ryan to re-confirm for my insane mind that these delicious nachos were vegan, because the cheese tasted like straight up OG nacho cheese. It was definitely vegan but I feel like it would fool a non-vegan any day! I would add chikn to it next time, just to further my pigdom. The burrito was really flavorful! They somehow marinated the chikn to perfection and it actually held up a nice texture, unlike when I try to marinade chikn at home. If you are vegan and in Vegas, you have to try this place.",

He was actually super nice but seemed more interested in himself than us; I asked for a soda water and he responded that he doesn't like soda water, went ahead and served me flat water anyway. He didn't write anything down, so when I changed my mind on salad dressing, he went ahead and brought the one I originally asked about, and when our bill came he went ahead and charged us for the margaritas despite both of us checking in for the free ones.  I understand everyone has a bad day, but I mean, did he have to mess up *everything* we requested? It's all good though, because he was having fun which means we werent upset. We had fun with it overall, and weren't upset enough to bring it up to him.   Otherwise, atmosphere was fun and food was tasty.",

Very nice atmosphere on the strip.   FOOD: Started with the dip trio. Salsa was spicy & flavorful, but not mouth burning. The guac was delicious! It was chunky & you could taste the onion and garlic. The cheese was zesty with jalapenos, but again not overpowering. I had the chicken chimichanga. I take my chimis bery seriously. Many places claim to have a fried shell but do not OR dont offer the fried shell. Well isnt that a burrito then? This chimi was large in size and had a perfectly fried shell! The chicken inside was flavored very well which mixed masterfully with the guac on top. One negative: there were also beans & the way mine was rolled it seemed like the right half was chicken & the left half was beans instead of being a great combo of each in every bite.  SERVICE: id have to agree with prior reviews & say it was disappointing. Our waitress greeted us with her depressing story about how shed rather be home in bed. Not what anyone wants to chat about before dinner. Perhaps some customer service lessons for the crew are in order.   Overall it was a great dinner & i would / will definitely be back for another try!",

We waited a little bit for a seat (because it's crowded as the food/quality is amazing) but it was well worth the short wait. Honestly I could've waited an hour and still been happy when the food came because it was that good. Highly recommend the fake chicken (my boyfriend said it was better than real chicken and he is a strict meat eater). We got a free margarita for checking in on yelp also and hoooooomygod the margaritas are huge and taste delicious. I honestly don't even like margaritas and I never have but I am not one to turn down a free margarita from a server and I am so glad I tried it. If you go, please remember to be kind to your server! They have a billion tables and they are making it work so props to them. So so happy with this place will definitely come back when I go back to Vegas.",

Service: good - our waiter was straightforward and checked in on us an appropriate amount of times.  Speed: fine - we were sat down within 5-10 minutes, and the food came in about 10 minutes.  Price: Entrees were around $12-20. I thought this was a little pricey for what you're getting. If things were priced $8-14, I would feel happier and this would be a go-to place for me. At $12-20, it was good enough where I'm happy I tried it, but don't really see myself rushing to go back any time soon (Not that there aren't places at $12-20 I do rush to go back to; eg. Carson's Kitchen, Lotus of Siam).",

After a  couple of frustrating days (in which we had our car broken into and were burgled), we were in desperate need of some positive vibes. Meeting Jovanny was easily one of the best things about this (very eventful) trip. From his excellent customer service to his bubbly, warm personality, we were thrilled to have him as our server. He was very sympathetic to our plight and made our dining experience extra special to ensure we left feeling better about our time in Vegas.   The margaritas, nachos, and chips and salsa were all fantastic. I would rate Nacho Daddy a four or five based on that alone, but the service we experienced with Jov was second to none (and I'm serious - best ever). The staff who brought out our food were super polite and friendly as well. I only wish we could leave 10 stars.  Thank you for helping to salvage our vacation!",

Anywho, the smothered burrito was very subpar to say this is a Mexican restaurant. The southwest egg rolls were typical frozen section egg rolls. Both the buffalo and BBQ chicken nachos were really good. The daddy margarita and house margarita were good, but missing alcohol. We left with no buzz at all. I would suggest going here for the nachos and a photo opp with the scorpion shot, ONLY! We went during happy hour and had coupons. The bartenders also go from touching everything from money to hair to cleaning without washing their hands. Totally not sanitary! But, no big deal if you're already drunk, right? lol",

    "text": "Sorry Daddy, but you are Nacho my type.  I have dined at the downtown Nacho Daddy location and I also attended a Yelp Elite event at this location.  I returned to this location shortly before 6 pm on a Tuesday with a friend who had never been to Nacho Daddy.   Despite it being happy hour, there was not very many people dining and we were quickly taken to a large and comfortable booth to wait for our server. Personally, I felt like service was a little slow considering how empty the place was, but our waitress was very friendly.  We started out with margaritas which were excellent. No complimentary chips and salsa here, Daddy's a stingy one.   Since there was a taco Tuesday special (3 for $5), we decided to share a plate of the avocado tacos that I thought were the standout item served at the Elite event. Sadly, these were not as light and crispy as I remembered and they were served drenched in salsa.    I had never ordered nachos from either of the Nacho Daddy locations I had been to, so it seemed fitting that we share some and we decided on the Filet Mignon Nachos. While the nachos are quite large and easily enough for two people to share, I found the ingredients to not be well dispersed and the ranchero sauce overpowered the other flavors on the plate.   Total damage for 2 margaritas, the tacos which were on special and a plate of nachos to share was over $50, pretip. While this is by no means overboard for a dinner on the Strip, I do think it was a bit high for what we actually received.   I will keep Nacho Daddy in mind for the rare occasions I need a vegan-friendly spot to take guests for a meal. Personally, I don't foresee myself coming back for more than a margarita.",

Went a few days later back again (because it was soo good) for a ground beef nacho dish and it had a lot more toppings. Margaritas were strong and for a great price (~$8/each) and the fires ice cream was delish. 11/10 would recommend",

    "text": "Taco Bell is that you?   This Nacho Daddy is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops outside. To get here you have to walk about halfway through the shops, and then follow the signs for Harmon Street Restaurants. Then you go outside and walk a bit further and you will find it. It's next to BWW and Hot N Juicy. Not sure if there is anywhere closer to park, but it's quite a distance from the parking garage.   I met a friend here at 5:30p on a Tuesday. It was pretty quiet, yet it took a while for our server to approach our table. When she finally showed up, she was upbeat and friendly. She explained some specials to us and recommended a few items as well. We both got white peach margs on the rocks, which were good, although I feel like mine was a bit heavy handed on the sweet n sour. It was happy hour (3-6 weekdays) and tequila shots were only $4, so maybe add a shot if you like it a little stronger.  As for the food, it was nothing to write home about. It really tasted like Taco Bell, but with strip prices. We split an order of filet mignon nachos, and fried avocado tacos. The nachos come with beans, cheese, filet mignon, guacamole, pico, and sour cream. We asked for the pico on the side as it had jalapenos in it, but still the nachos were pretty spicy. I believe it was the ranchero sauce that was over powering and took away from any of the other flavors. The tacos were also spicy and I couldn't even really tell I was eating avocado. I was disappointed because my friend had raved about them, and we both really just thought they were meh. All in all, I would say that this is a one and done for me.",

To be honest, we were drawn in by the free margarita for checking in on Yelp.   We were quickly greeted by our server, Ari. She was amazing! She recommended Margaritas we might like and told us her favorite items off the menu. I got the garlic shrimp nachos, and my boyfriend got chimichangas. We were both pleased with our excellent service, comfortable atmosphere and amazing food! We will definitely be coming back next time we are in town!",

We went to this place because they have \"Vegan\" options,  and because my mother in Law, who was visiting, is not vegan. So it was a good move for us all.  We went to the one on the west side, on Sahara. Place looked great, plenty of TVs, awesome play list of songs, and it seemed clean. Place looked well staffed as well.   Our server lacked a certain spunk, and communication was not her strong suit.... at all. They dont provide chips or salsa, you have to buy those... most places, its complimentary, but no here. We had to ask our server for refills on chips and salsa. The food took 45 minutes to get to us, which it wasn't that packed to take that long. Server could have communicated a little or at the very least be on top of the refills. When the food finally got here, it was cold. The food was cold and i was full of chips because they took so long with food. Honestly, it was so bad... they never even followed up with is to see how the food was. Manager? What manager, they usually make their presence felt... not here. The manager was bussing. The food, besides being cold, was not that great... mother in law who not vegan didn't like her food and the presentation was horrible. Avocado tocos were good.  But the service was so bad, we will never return. To many options in this town. They could of made up ground with service despite cold and less than mediocre food... in truth i dont know what was worse, the service or the food.",

While the FILET MIGNON NACHOS were AMAZING they have a red sauce...if you're a fan of red sauce and filet mignon you'll LOVE THEM. I'm a CHEESY person so the SUPREME TOSTADA NACHOS were my ultimate fave. Everything we ordered was AMAZING...elote, Signature Soft Tacos the Signature flour tortillas are AMAZING and aren't your average flour tortilla...they're flaky and buttery. The Shell is filled with jack cheese, roasted chipotle salsa, carmelized chipotle onions and cilantro.   One item that we didn't order that seemed to be rather popular were the fajitas. I'll definitely give them a try next time around.   Parking can sometimes be complexed, as we weren't so lucky our first time around but the second time around we were able to valet park in the Miracle Mile Mall parking structure. While there are other locations this particular Nacho Daddy has the most stars and is worth everyone of them plus more.",

    "text": "Great vegan eats, but service was sub-par.  I was roaming the Vegas strip late one Friday night (after midnight) and discovered that Nacho Daddy had a wide assortment of vegan options, so I had to give them a try.   I was greeted by a friendly bartender who offered me a menu. After that, he didn't come back for quite some time because he was busy chatting with guests and co-workers. I understand that engaging with customers is great, but it took away from the quality and attentiveness of service that not only I received, but that others around me received as well.   Everyone raves about the amazing vegan nachos, but I wanted to be a bit more daring. I ordered the vegan chick'n quesadilla and it was outstanding. The only thing that seemed slightly off was the consistency of the vegan sour cream (very watery/runny), but otherwise I loved the dish. They were very good about repeating back my order multiple times, leading me to believe that they pay attention to detail and want to ge vegan orders right. I even had a chef (or manager?) ask me if I received the vegan quesadilla, although it was a bit odd that this happened after I had finished eating.   Back to the service. I didn't get any silverware or napkins with the meal and it took a while to get some.   The drinks were hit and miss. The white peach margarita was very good. I hesitated due to its $13 price tag, but it was large and delicious. The house margarita was just bad. Very syrupy and too sour. I rarely leave a drink unfinished, but I couldn't even drink half of it.   Speaking of the margarita, my bartender forgot the drink, not once, but twice. Maybe it's because it was free with my Yelp check-in? Who knows.   The patrons next to me didn't get the best service either. They ordered a flaming drink, but the bartender never lit the tealight. There were also multiple occasions that drinks and entrees were brought to the wrong people.   Overall, the vegan food really boosts this review, as the drinks were inconsistent and service were mediocre.",

I needed to chew it a little and rinse down with some water. Oh so good. Margarita's were very good. Portions here seemed large so we ordered and appetizer of street taco's and split an order of Supreme Nacho's. Fillet Mignon street taco's were tender and had all the flavor of a traditional beef street taco. Nacho's were a very large portion. Not to much of any one ingredient, well balanced. I will definitely return to this restaurant, after all a guy has to eat more than one scorpion in his life.",

The only downside was one of my friends meals didn't make it out before everyone else had finished theirs. As soon as we notified AJ he quickly acknowledged and noted it would not be on the bill but it would be on the table. Even the manager came out and identified the problem and told us it was not going to be billed. If i lived in LV i would definitely be a regular! Wonderful service, staff and food.

Our server Laura came over soon after and got us waters and gave us helpful tips and recommendations.   We both checked in on Yelp for the free house margarita, which was strong and delicious. We ordered the filet mignon nachos and requested to add jalapenos and Mexican corn off the cob to share, which both came out pretty fast. Everything that people around us ordered looked so good and it was hard for us to decide on what to get, but we didn't want to order too much. That was the perfect amount of food. We actually devoured every single bite. The food was so delicious (and the music/ambiance is pretty loud) that we ate most of the time without talking to each other. I usually scoop off or request for food without sour cream and refried beans, but the nachos had just the right amount of everything that I was able to eat it without any complaints. A little more filet mignon meat would be better, but overall still amazing! The corn was the perfect side to eat in combination with the nachos, grilled to perfection. The jalapenos were super spicy, so we didn't need a lot for a nice spicy kick.  Laura was very attentive the entire time we were there. She brought extra napkins without us having to request, knowing that eating nachos can get messy. She also offered us to-go cups when she saw that we had some margarita left. We agreed that if we had this back home (in OC, CA), we would be there a lot!",

We also got an order of queso dip. Everything was super hot and fresh tasting. We also loved the indoor decor, super fun and inviting. Also, since my husband and I were already a few drinks deep, we were ballsy enough to try their famous scorpion shot. Phew, thaaaat was an experience, haha!

I'm from SoCal so I LOVE a good super nacho... zero disappointment here!!! Our plates were practically licked clean from how delicious the food tasted.  Lowkey, they're also known for their $20 SCORPION shots!!!!! They looked small on the pics so I was down to get one for my BFF's dirty 30 bday... shocked to see how HUGE those suckers were... chewing did nothing. Just swallow. Yechh.. earned our souvenir scorpion shot glasses..  We also got a free margarita with Yelp checkin plus a free bday dessert (was offered a bday shot but we were already hammered lol)",

When you see a place with a zany name on the Strip, you expect to get overcharged for decent (but not terrific) food. Hence the surprise. I opted for a nice and healthy burrito bowl that was well-balanced and flavorful and fresh, and I paid somewhere south of $15 for it. That would be a good deal in any city, let alone on Las Vegas Boulevard.  The ambiance was fun too - industrial and not too self-important - with the clear ability to handle big parties.  Strong recommendation for great food that won't break the bank.",

Nothing bugs me more than restaurants calling a huge pile of chips with a few toppings thrown on it \"nachos\". That is most definitely not the case at Nacho Daddy.  I went with the Supreme Tostado Nachos after much debate. They have so many options it's hard to choose. They laid the most beautiful plate of nachos I've ever seen in front of me and I was instantly in love. The chip to topping ratio was on point. It wasn't a heaping pile of chips with a few toppings. It was even better once I ate it! So much flavor and so many toppings! So many toppings that it was near impossible to eat these without a fork.   All other restaurants should take a lesson from Nacho Daddy and learn what True nachos should be like!",

    "text": "The last time I went to Nacho Daddy is when their first location had just opened downtown.  The menu has definitely gotten bigger and better since then! I was definitely impressed. They have a great selection of gluten free/vegan options that sounded appetizing. And a lot of non-gluten free/vegan options for those of you who don't worry about that kinda stuff.  We were just a party of 3, my friend, my son and I. We were seated rather quickly in a big booth. Kayla was our server and brought us menus. She was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! I know we've all been out to places where the server was less than pleasant.. It really puts a damper on things. This was totally not the case with Kayla- or any of the employees. Even the guy who bought us our food and the lovely gal who was clearing our table. I'm getting ahead of myself though.  Kayla made sure we knew what Nacho Daddy was all about before leaving us to browse the menus. T Money ordered off of the kids menu- 2 plain patties Lliterally, plain.. No cheese. No bun. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Zero..) and fries. I appreciated she didn't think I was a total weirdo ordering that for my kid and she let me know I wasn't the only parent that had to do that. We had a good laugh- I seriously appreciated that because sometimes I get a weird look ordering that. I wasn't too hungry, so my friend and I ordered the trio of dips with fresh tortilla chips- Queso, guac and salsa. My friend ordered two tacos on the flour tortillas sans sides. I also ordered the Daddy margarita and a house margarita later on.   Everything was brought out surprisingly quick. My margarita(s) were great- not too sweet either, which is just the way I like it. The guac was awesome. It was fresh and chunky. I didn't taste the queso (dairy allergy) but my friend gave it the thumbs up. And they serve it with a little tea light underneath to keep it warm and flowing. T Money's patties were a decent size. You can tell they were hand-formed and were also pretty thick. His fries came out hot and super fresh. He is legitimately the fry king and he liked them a lot.   To be frank, I hadn't come back to Nacho Daddy after the first time because our first time kinda sucked. This more than made up for it- enough for me to want to come back and regularly frequent this joint. They have some great happy hour specials I'd like to try AND the loaded vegan/gluten free nachos look amaaaaaazing.  Much love and props to Kayla! Be sure to ask for her if you stop in and she'll take great care of you.",

My brother loved his tacos, which were also stuffed to the brim with meat. My brother also tried the steak fajitas, which were really good. Tons of meat, veggies, rice and refried beans. It's just an awesome place to grab a casual bite in Vegas.",

And not just a few selections but a whole section in the menu. The first time I went I got the Vegan Loaded Nachos with Vegan Chick'n and they were 10/10!! The vegan queso was bomb which is rare. Not everyone can master vegan cheese.  This time I got the Vegan Chick'n Chimichanga. For me it wasn't as good as the Nachos, but still very good! Especially if you like a lot of onions, peppers, and mushrooms cause it's filled with them! My friend got the vegan quesadilla which I can also say was 10/10! Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu.  So overall the service was great, restaurant nice and clean, and food BOMB! You must go.",

Even though the nachos are pretty pricey (about $20), the taste is soo worth it. I only wish they opened a location in OC so I can eat it whenever I want.

Our appetizer was also extremely tasty and seemed like it was made to order.  Our server was also wonderful. She constantly made sure we had everything we needed, or had someone else stop by if she was tied up. She also sent us home with some fresh chips and salsa- something we really appreciated!  Great food, great service, cool atmosphere!",

We started off with shrimp tacos, 3 for $7 because it was taco Tuesdays. If you want beef or chicken, it would be $5. Flavor was there and the shrimp was very delicious. It's topped with mango, onions, cilantro.   Our next order was the filet mignon nachos, cost around a whopping $19!!! I understand it's Las Vegas and prices are marked higher but it was ridiculous for a small plate of nachos. It seemed like they slumped out on the meat so it was mostly toppings with like 20 chips..   I was disappointed in presentation, nachos are meant to be a big plate!",

The mango was recommended and I'm glad I went with that one. They also have pitchers.. thankfully.   We ordered the trio dip and it was good! They have three levels of salsa, the spicy one was my favorite. My mom ordered the shrimp tacos and loved them. I had the vegan chicken nachos and they were the bomb. Sooo many vegetarian and vegan options. My dad and our friend split the chicken nachos and enjoyed that the chicken was shredded.   The presentation of the dishes were visually appealing and everything tasted good. I would say the best part about this restaurant is the service though. Our waitress was on it completely and other staff members stepped in multiple times just to make sure we were okay. We never had to wait on drink refills, and in my opinion, that's awesome service for a Vegas strip restaurant.  I would recommend this place, and would be happy to go back. Thanks Nacho Daddy!",

Personally I'm a fan of the hole-in-the-wall janky af Mexican restaurants (like the one further north up the strip) but my friend told me that she wanted to come here because she's vegan so why not?   As we arrived, the hostess told us the wait would be about 40 minutes so we went to the bar to order some water and look at the menu. It wasn't even 20 minutes before we were seated and ready to order. I used the yelp check-in and got a complimentary house margarita and the filet mignon nachos. I cannot emphasize it enough - it's so worth it! I was so tired of spending $15+ for a garbage meal elsewhere. The portions here are huge (check out the pictures from other reviews) so you can definitely share the entire thing with a friend.   My friend (not the vegan one) ended up getting the thai chicken nachos and it was super strange but delicious. That being said, I feel like you're able to adventurous when it comes to their variety of nachos. Just make sure you share, it's honestly too much food.  PS. The service was great, our server(s) were super attentive and came to check on us every 5 minutes.",

Tacos were a rollercoaster, at their peak they were great and at their valleys they were edible. None that I can specifically remember loving but you are pretty safe getting anything off the menu honestly.   Wasn't a huge fan of anything else here but it came highly recommended so I think... I went at the wrong time.   THE VERDICT: I have finally experienced it and now I know that it isn't a place for me. I had expectations of out of this world drunk food that would provide many tastegasms but unfortunately, I was just angry because I need to hydrate Itzel!!",

My boyfriend and I had their Tinga nachos one night and the next day we went back for their ultimate nachos. Yes, we were hooked. The portions are quite big between the both of us we were able to finish one order.  Customer service is very important to me, the staff and manager were delightful.

For our entrees, I ordered the grilled chicken salad and my fiance ordered the Golden Knights nachos. My salad had cucumbers, avocado, cheese, tortilla strips and grilled chicken.

I came back and once I found out there was a location on the strip, I knew I had to go again!   We ordered the Naked Grilled Wings with BBQ sauce with ranch to start off with appetizers. Beware: their portions are pretty filling! If I knew this, I would've not ordered an appetizer! I ordered the Fiesta Nacho which is big enough to feed 2 people (I shared with my brother!); it consisted of chicken breast, salsa, onions, beans, cheese, green/red chips + tortilla chips, queso fresco, pico de gallo, guac and sour cream! SO GOOD. These nachos are life changing and I can't look at nachos the same way again.   My dad ordered a burrito as it was his favorite type of food and he loved it! My mom ordered the tamale-enchilada entree combination and she LOVED it. Nacho Daddy gives such a great amount of chicken breast meat and the portion size is definitely filling. I love how the tamale is open faced which is a different twist on how tamales are usually made!   The service was okay. They ran out of items we wanted to originally try. They ran out of the Daddy's Wings which is why we ended up ordering the Naked Grilled Wings (which was not a disappointment at all!) On top of that, they ran out of deep fried ice cream & ended up getting the Caramel Apple Nacho (which was not disappointing at all either). Overall, we ordered items we originally didn't plan to but still loved it!!  Nacho Daddy is going to become must-have when I go to Las Vegas! I can't wait to come back especially because I didn't get the chance to check in on Yelp for a free Margarita~",

    "text": "Amazing nachos. Excellent house margarita (no really, it's good). The only negative I have is you have to buy new pants after you eat here because the nachos a HUGE but they are so good you can't stop eating them. The atmosphere was decent but not amazing. I'm here for another week and a half and I'm trying to restrain so I don't go up two pants sizes. Maybe they could offer half sizes.   Oh wait, just saw they have mexican corn. I'm definitely going back. Eat now. Diet later.",

Some of us love breakfast, some of us don't (kind of a hard group to work with in the mornings. . .). We had heard great things about Nacho Daddy, so we walked around the corner from Planet Hollywood, and found a seat at the bar. Kasandra greeted us, and quickly suggested the Bacon Cheese Enchiladas for my breakfast-loving husband. The rest of us ordered Crispy Chicken Sandwiches and Pork Tacos. Needless to say, we were so happy with the food and the service (thanks, Kasandra!) we came back the next afternoon for snacks before going to the airport.  Be sure to check in on YELP, for the free house Margarita (with entree purchase).",

We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos..and they were not that good. Chicken was too big and there was an absurd amount of celery. We split the cali burrito...and it was nasty. There were garlic fries in the burrito which sounded amazing, but it was gross. I went home and was sick. I gave it 3 stars because service was decent and we did the scorpion shot.",

The nachos I had (filet mignon) were great, but could not compare to the Cuban nachos last summer. If anyone from management is reading this, bring them back PERMANENTLY.  Otherwise, everything was great. The bartender who served me (Scarlett) was lovely. She was professional, sociable, affable, and clearly likes her job.  I'll be back.",

The fish tacos...wow. My wife orders fish tacos almost anytime they are on a menu, and these may have been her favorite. My pescatarian son that doesn't like Mexican food was raving about the Vegan Chik'N Chimichanga (although the Chik'N seemed to be missing). For the strip, the prices were very reasonable, especially with our hotel discount.",

Our server was nice but there was a tad bit of a long wait for her first to come to our table.",

The Nachos were a particular stand out for the blending of flavors that simultaneously maintained individual ingredients saying hello.  Nice touch that our server asked if we wanted to take a fun pic of the Flaming Fajitas, which we did.  Our bartender Scarlett was tops.  Daddy and I will definitely be reacquainting ourselves in the future. ;)",

These servings are huge and shareable and they have a bunch of different combinations of meats and toppings in general. I ordered mine with carne asada and was blown away by the taste. One downfall... the chips tend to get soggy so next time I will be sure to get the salsa on the side. They also have a variety of margaritas... I had the Mexican candy and was not disappointed! They also have a vegan menu! Expect a wait if wanting to be seated at a table and expect slower service if sitting at the bar. I witnessed a group of 4 waiting about 30 minutes and also a couple that walked away before being served their food at the bar because the wait was ridiculously long... to order and to receive. On the plus side, they have purse hooks under the bar so you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on your purse if it's hanging on the seat!",

Place is located on Harmon Ave. Right next door to the Hot N Juicy restaurant, and near the Miracle Mile shops. Surprisingly, place was not packed knowing that is on the Strip. You will be able to find parking, not unless you park in the Miracle Mile garage.   Cool little spot on the strip. You will not get much of this, but they have outside patio dining, inside with table top and booth seating. They even have souvenirs if you are dropping in from out of town.   We were seated right away, and given a huge menu to take a look at. Looking through the menu: they have awesome appetizers for sharing, entree, combination plates, desserts, long list of alcohol, and nachos galore. Of course, they are known mostly for their nachos, free margaritas if you check in on yelp, and their scorpion shots.   What we ordered: the triple dip appetizer (queso, salsa, and house made guacamole), filet mignon nachos, and the ultimate enchilada (comes with beans and rice). Wait time was perfect since we were hungry enough to order appetizers this time. If not, you may want to come when you are extremely hungry or craving good mexican food.  The appetizer, queso was evenly seasoned with the perfect amount of spice. Guacamole had good amount of lime, onion, and has been one of the best that I have tasted in awhile. Salsa, was good all around. Now, do not let the pictures fool you. The filet mignon nachos is good to share for two. But, I was able to finish by myself (this has never happened before)! Loved the chili, salsa white sauce guacamole and cheese mix. One bite to just a few more is not enough!! You will want to keep eating. The enchiladas filled up my fiancee and he eats big. Again, do not let the size fool you.  Unfortunately, so we were both full, we did not get to try the dessert. We will soon be back. Thanks Nacho Daddy for the awesome food, service, and atmosphere.",

I got my strawberry margarita, the triple dip with queso, guac, and normal dip. It was awesome! It was so cute there was a little candle at bottom to make the queso warm and loved the fresh diced tomatoes on the guac!! I also got the taco enchilada combination and it was awesome! The pork taco was delicious, you guys have to try that one. Everything was cooked well and flavor was good. It's a big portion so I would say most items here are shareable. The music playing was also good! It was hip pop mostly with Chris Brown. Loved the music selection. The prices here weren't bad either it was affordable and you get what you pay for. Definitely recommend this for your Mexican cravings.",

Service was great throughout the sercive. Gabby was a real gem. She is positive and really wanted our experience to be as great as the food. We all loved our choices.  Prices are also reasonable. Will rate 5 star and will be back soon",

Not only did we have to wait ( not busy at all ) they couldn't communicate with each other or us letting us know what is going on... then got seated to a wet table, then waited 5 min after gotten seated for the waiter to come and take our order... We ordered took 20 min for our food (not to bad) my boyfriend ordered a strawberry margarita... the manager made it cuz the 2 bartenders called off.. it was really thick was hard going down... then i asked for sour cream and the waiter didnt come back for over 10 min with it and by then i was done with the food.. never asked if i needed a refill of my tea.. i tryed asking her and next thing i know she is gone.. i have been in the food industry so i know people call off things happen but not like this... Thanks to the kitchen manager Ruben Garcia  came out and talked to us and we express our concern and what happend he was NOT happy... he took care of us made us feel we mattered.. and took care of the bill... tje food was great...",

Our server Vince was super nice, welcoming and accommodating! The atmosphere was really cool. My girlfriend got the pork taco and chicken enchilada plate. It both looked and tasted amazing. I got the spicy shrimp nachos but I'm thinking that mine was not seasoned properly. There was no spice at all and looked kind of plain. I am not saying that it was bad because it was not spicy as advertised. I don't even really care for spicy food. I just wanted shrimp nachos and that was the only one on the menu. There was just no flavor at all. Super bland. I personally give it a 3 but my girlfriend gives a 5 so I'll do a 4. I think that this was just a one off or I ordered the wrong thing. I might give this place another try but I'm not going out of my way to eat here as I did this time.",

Both the lobster and the filet mignon tacos were very good to excellent. The filet mignon was a bit too salty but very good.  The rice and beans that accompanied the tacos were nothing to write home about.  I ordered a cucumber and jalapeno margarita which was very good.

He recommended the Moco Loco Nachos and the Filet Mignon Nachos. Both were delicious but I have to say that the Moco Loco was da bomb!!!  I think that's my new favorite!  We checked in for the free margarita and even got a birthday dessert for my hubby!  The lit up a nacho as the candle!!!",

I was not sure if they could pull off the nachos but I have to say the supreme and fajita nachos are very good and enough to share.  The house margaritas were also very good and complimentary with a Yelp check in so that was a win win!  I recommend you try this place if your missing Tex-Mex flavors.  Also, the wait staff was great and wait time was very reasonable.  However, I did say we were there for a late lunch.",

    "text": "First let me start by saying that yelp gave me a warning that there were multiple reviews done on the same IP address. With that said, we still wanted to give them a chance because they welcome families.  My review is more based on the service and perception.  Experience: We walked in and there are four hostess One with her back towards the entrance. They turn and look at us but did not say anything. Finally, one of the girls in the back turns to my kid and asked how many? Our server seemed to be rushing us to order drinks and order off the menu not giving us any time to look. We ordered our drinks and our food. I tell him I have a free house margarita for the Yelp check-in. He brings it over and All you can taste is the syrup, grossest margarita ever with no alcohol. I checked and made sure their house margarita had alcohol, I only took one sip and my jaw hurt. Tried mixing it and it still gross that i gave up.   Food: We ordered the shrimp spicy nachos with spinach chips, chicken enchilada nachos, and the cheese quesadilla. The food was maybe a 3.5 to 4 star quality.   Prices are good and location is good too, it's away from the strip maybe about a block away so it's not as busy and also not that far.   Overall I would not return and would not recommend. Also, next time I'll listen to yelp when it says something suspicious about the five-star reviews.",

Not so much.  Our food and drinks were served in a timely manner. This is where it goes downhill, Our server checked in on us once during our meal vs checking in after we had finished our meals. The ice in our waters had melted. We had finished our meals 45 minutes. So thinking by seeing empty plates one would check on us? Nope, we can understand letting your patrons eat their meals, but we were forgotten. Every server walked by us and didn't have the courtesy to let their fellow server know their table was done. We got a servers attention and requested to speak with the manager.   I guess to help \"apologize\" for being forgotten we were given a \"free drink\" voucher with a purchase of an entree and $4 off our meal. Having worked in the industry, it could've been resolved better.",

This location isn't the easiest to uber to but for reference there is a area a little past the restaurant where the uber can drop you off. There is a aquarium in the front with a couple scorpions unfortunately they weren't social during my wait for the table. We got seated in about minutes. There were plenty of TVs for any night you're looking to catch a game. We got started with some chips and salsa which are a great way to soak up a tiny bit of alcohol. and our server started us off with a couple waters and took our drink orders. We got a frozen margarita no salt and a ginger ale We ended up with a classic margarita with salt and a pepsi. The classic margarita is good and strong. I'd call it a potential hair of the dog candidate.  It took about 15-20 minutes for a delicious plate of nachos make its way out but unfortunately it wasn't ours. The next two plates were and they were piled high with toppings. For the price a definite deal. They have a wide variety of nachos with different proteins for your tasting pleasure. We ended up getting the BBQ chicken nachos and the classic nachos. The chips kept their crunch throughout most of the plate I never ran out of toppings.  The service during this trip was just a little distracted. Our server seemed to have their mind elsewhere and brought out drinks that were different from what we ordered and had food sent out that wasn't ours but the nachos were good. Nacho Daddy is a place worth checking out if you're a nacho fan or simply need to absorb some alcohol with a little hair of the dog for the hangover. I don't think distracted service is a normal thing at Nacho Daddy.",

My waitress, Amanda, was simply amazing. Extremely attentive and just candid and easy to interact with. Her recommendations were spot on. We had chips and guacamole for an appetizer (good for two people- order an extra if you have more than that), carne asada and the nacho average burger nachos (don't even try to share- get your own and eat the whole dang thing yourself. You deserve it. Hell, its Vegas! Be fat for a week). I was still recuperating from the previous night's drinks, so I didn't try their margaritas but I've heard they are to die for! Eat here! There's nothing else I can say. You have to experience this place for yourself. Oh! Almost forgot- this place is great for vegans! I'm a meat-eater, but thought it was pretty cool they had so many vegan options. The whole world needs to eat here.",

There is a check in deal for a free marg (amazing!) which I had and my husband got a jalapeno marg. They also do these things called scorpion shots. We didn't get these but our bar neighbor did. An actual scorpion in my drink is a solid no for me but to each your own!  We split the crab and lobster nachos. Insane portion and lots of crab and lobster. These are definitely spicy AND we got the siracha on the side. So delicious and like their motto \"never a chip left dry\".",

We both pulled up the Yelp check-in \"free margarita\" and the bartender quickly served us with delicious drinks. My wife ordered the Vegan Crispy Avocado Street Tacos and I had a variety of Street Tacos, including shrimp and chicken. Fresh, hot, and delicious! Topped it off with a Daddy's Margarita, which was great, too. Originally was going to try the Scorpion Shot, but can always do it next time. Will definitely visit Nacho Daddy again!",

The reason I ordered this one over the Chik'n nachos was because of a review i had read on Yelp about the chick'n so I was naturally hesitant. Plus the chick'n nachos was around $1 more I believe.   Well they ended up bringing me the chick'n nachos instead of the one that I actually ordered. I was bummed but I didn't send it back because I didn't want to waste all of that food. It ended up being pretty good so I was satisfied at the end of the meal still.   Additionally, we got the triple dipper - I ate the guac and sauce while my boyfriend at the queso. We both agreed it was very good.  Our waitress (with mermaid hair color) was very attentive and kind to us while we sat at the bar as well.   I would definitely come back purely on the fact that they had a ton of vegan options! Kudos to Nacho Daddy for offering that!!",

The food was delicious - my husband had the Supreme Tostada nachos and devoured them. He loves nachos and orders them at restaurants everywhere, trying to find the best ones, and Nacho Daddy did not disappoint.  My daughter loved her enchilada nachos, and my son (who doesn't really care for Mexican food) found his perfect entree in the Nacho Average Burger Nachos, which was basically a cheeseburger on top of chips. I had the seafood nachos - lobster, crab, white queso, black beans, and a mango salsa/sweet chili sauce. They tasted amazing, and we were surprised and delighted to have them comped because there was a delay in my dish coming out.  The kitchen manager came out personally to tell us, and he was super courteous and apologetic. We didn't mind a little wait, but the great service and extra consideration made us loyal customers and we will definitely be coming back again!",

Nacho Daddy stood out because my friend had been raving about it since our last Vegas visiting. From the minute we walked in, everyone was so nice and helpful. The place has an open floor plan with tall ceilings and music loud, but I love that it was overpowering conversation. The menu was vast with so many surf, turf and vegan options I couldn't decide what to order. The first person to give me some warm feedback was Jovany. His honest opinions were so refreshing and ordered the Sizzling Shrimp Tacos without any hesitations. Then, he was delighted we were from OC and gave us two Nacho Daddy shot glasses on the house. Hello?! How awesome is it to connect with someone so real? Anyway, the strawberry margarita is stiff and good. I'm dancing my way out of here. Thanks so much for your hospitality, Jovany! We'll definitely be back!",

We came in around midnight and we waited for probably 30 minutes to get 4 to go meals. It was very busy so it was really disappointing. The menu is huge and I will commend them on having lots of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. I got the vegan fajita bowl. It was not terrible but definitely not great. The meat replacement they add on top was very salty. I'm not sure if that was because of seasoning they used or if that particular brand of replacement meat is salty. The pico they added was alright but needed cilantro and lime for sure. The vegan sour cream was better than I assumed it would be. The guacamole was surprisingly good. Chunky and full of lime taste which was delicious. Another weird thing is the waitress came back to assume is out good was almost ready several times and told me twice \"they're just figuring out your vegan bowl\". I don't know what she meant by that but was kinda unsettling. Like I said it was terrible just won't be going back. If you're in a hurry definitely try somewhere else.",

When we inquired with the server, we were told that it is their policy to round down the change. I have lived a very transient lifestyle. I've lived in 7 different states and have traveled to many cities. I also eat out quite often, at least 2-3 times a week. I have NEVER encountered such a policy. To be quite honest, I question the legality of the policy. I will do a bit more research on that when I get home and on a laptop. This is not my area of practice. At best, it is a horrible, deceptive practice. At worst, it is illegal and they are stealing from their patrons.",

    "text": "Nacho daddy was a very good American Mexican restaurant to visit. The customer service was great. The house margarita with the \"Yelp visit\" was a great addition to the meal. The food was hot and tasty. The music in the venue reminded me of late 90s and the early 2000s so very nostalgic for me. The March madness basketball games were on tv. My server was very informative about the \"scorpion shot\" that the restaurant provides. I was very happy with the menu and will be sure to recommend to family and friends.",

This place had an entire page on its menu for their vegan food and included chocolate cake. My husband and I ordered the fully loaded nachos. We have not had nachos in years. They were amazing. The portions are enormous but we still ate every last bit of the nachos. I had a kale salad with vegan chicken. It was perfectly seasoned. They know how to cook here. And they make the vegan food with care and love!",

Our server accidentally put the Thai chicken nachos into the computer, so those were initially brought out. She quickly realized her mistake, and the kitchen remade the order and brought them to the table within about five minutes.

Their sweet and sour is made in house and actually pretty good, but the margarita itself was not well made.  I know it was free, but if it was a True representation of their margaritas, I wouldn't get one here.  Aside from that, this is a good place to eat affordably on the strip.  It's part of the Miracle Mile Shops, but the entrance is located on the outside of the shops.  There's plenty of seating and TVs everywhere for watching whatever is on.    As the name suggests, they have a large variety of nachos to choose from.  I couldn't decide which one to get, so I chose the Burger Nachos ($13.50) because it had a star next to it.  It had everything a burger would normally have, but tasted a lot like a taco salad.  They weren't bad, but something I could easily put together at home.  I was more impressed by my friend's enchilada nachos.  It tasted just like enchiladas, but in nacho form.  It's a cool place to go with your friends and grab a casual bite.  Just don't get the house margarita.",

Good amount of cheese and great value for the price!  Our waitress was also amazing! Made sure everything went smoothly and separated checks with no hassle!",

Lots of screw ups with our orders but overall everyone enjoyed their food. I had the filet mignon tacos which were delcious and my husband loved his filet mignon nachos. Nobody had a complaint on the taste of the food. The only complaints were that we did not receive what was ordered. They did fix almost everyones order and it all worked out in the end. I would come back again.",

I have gotten the vegan loaded nachos 2 other times prior to vist at this location & once at there other location on the westside. Everytime ordering the same thing vegan loaded nachos. My 1st experience ordering thru uber eats was fantastic.  I got everything plus more it arrived with a white vegan sauce & a yellow vegan cheese sauce ( mind you I never ordered this before) and this is what I got. I really enjoyed them & thought I have a new spot to get good vegan food. Then my 2nd uber eats order from same location everything went wrong I got a completely different experienc & order. Nothing like my 1st order I only one cheese sauce (yellow), no sour cream, no guacamole, no white cheese , no salsa so uber eats refinded my money. Went to dine in at other location on the westside & again was served 2 different cheese sauce at no extra charge everything was right.Then last night at downtown location I was charged $2 for asking for the white cheese sauce after getting my order with only the yellow cheese. 1st I asked to get both cheese sauces on the side our food comes out & I have NO Cheese sauces.  I sat waiting for my cheese sauces while my food got cold trying to get attention of our waiter tait who was just a blur running all over the Restaurant  when I finally got his attention I let him no I got no cheese sauce for my nachos. He told me he would get them as I  sat waiting & watching him do everything else but get my cheese sauce. I finally see a mgr & told him what happened & he immediately brings me out only the yellow cheese sauce so I start eating but I really wanted the white sauce that I'm use to & i like it better. So after flagging our waiter down I told him I still didn't get the white sauce so he had someone bring it out too me it was such a small bowl so I asked for another one then he let's me know I will be charged $1 so I said ok. I get my bill then I'm charged $2 so I asked why I got an extra charge when the white sauce is apart of the order & tells me it's not. I go on to tell him that I have ordered this many times from this location & other location and was never charged extra. He basically looks at me like I'm making this up or I miss understood all my previous orders @ this location & the other location.  He tells me that the white sauce is extra charge & that whom ever did my orders were wrong that its extra. So guess what that $2 he charged me for the white cheese sauce was his tip. Won't eat there again in person or uber eats.",

The venue itself is a cool theme with televisions everywhere. Nacho Daddy is a cool place to catch a Golden Knights game or your favorite out of town team. The staff at Nacho Daddy is friendly and the food comes out fairly quick. The food is where the rating fell off. By no means was the food bad, but it also wasn't what we were hoping for either. The taco meat tasted like it had been sitting in a warming tray for a few hours. I always give places some credit, so judging by past reviews, I am going to guess we went at the wrong time or an off night.",

Then the food showed up followed by her margarita.  About 10 seconds later our waitress appeared for the first time since ordering.  Though we watched her talking with other staff in the kitchen, she gave us some bull about being really busy and someone else must've forgotten about her margarita.  We told her it just came and the manager comped the margarita.  If it weren't for the food being very good this would not be a recommending review.

We got served pretty quickly, which was great.   I ordered the Vegan Loaded Nachos but asked for regular yellow cheese instead. I...don't know that I made a good choice aha. It didn't taste like the traditional nacho cheese you have at sporting events and such. I think it just threw me off because it was not what I expected.   We also ordered the Buffalo Hot Nacho and my guy thoroughly enjoyed them!",

The Pina Colada had the right blend of coconut and pineapple- oh! So frothy.  Followed by Mexican corn in mayo and hot sauce drizzled with lime - absolutely refreshing with warm notes of spice. Not too overpowering.  Next in line Shrimp Ceviche - marinated fresh shrimp, with avocado, tomatoes, cilantro and lime. Accompanied by a dip - fresh, vibrant and flavorful.  The finale was Cheesy Enchilada - right blend of sauce, cheese and rice. 4* for 2 points, absolutely no salt! Had to adjust salt in ceviche, corn and enchiladas. Service could be better - no smile, way too stiff.",

I felt a definite lack of cheese and beans on the nacho, this feeling was deepened by the overflowing sea salsa or pico de gallo drenching all the toppings and chips...  I feel like the nacho deserves a three star rating but our bartender/server (we sat at the bar) Scarlet was friendly, efficient, and gorgeous! Also, I think if I just got the sea of red sauce on the side...I would have probably enjoyed the food much more.   All in all, not sure if I would return on the next trip. If I do, it might be to try the fish taco.",

I came here for my Vegas trip because my boyfriend had wanted to try this place since last year! It was busy with an average of a 30 to 45-minute wait. Since it was on the strip, the wait was not as bad since we were able to walk around until they gave us a quick message to come back. That was very convenient.  As we sat down, our server was already attentive and provided us drinks and recommendations (since it was our first time) of the menu. My boyfriend got the VEGAS golden knights nacho and I got what our server recommended for tacos, the filet mignon tacos platter which came with two huge tacos, rice, and beans. I also got myself a margarita for fun and man, was it pretty strong. The food was absolutely filling, big in portions, and delicious.",

They also have an assortment of different options, so if you're not a nacho person you can still find something that you'd like.   Along with the amazing food, the service is incredible.

I know what you're thinking, \"the place is called NACHO DADDY, not burrito Daddy.\" But trust me, get the carne asada burrito - your tastebuds will thank me later.   My husband and I waited for about 15-20 minutes on a Saturday night before being seated at our table. We split an order of filet mignon nachos and also shared a carne asada burrito. Both were DIVINE. But the carne asada burrito absolutely stole the show. The tortilla was light and flaky which made it easier to take bites out of the burrito. The meat was flavorful. The pico on the burrito was fresh. It was everything burrito dreams are made of. To top it off we also took advantage of the free margarita for yelpers.   Our server was quick, knowledgeable and attentive. She helped us choose between my beloved carne asada burrito and boneless wings. She also allowed us to get two FREE margaritas!",

We parked in the free multistory parking building nearby and found parking fairly quickly. Finding the restaurant was a little tricky because I thought it was inside of the mall but it's actually located outside!  We were greeeted and seated immidiately and were sat with Manny. Manny offered great recommendations and was friendly. We ordered nachos to share which was more than enough for us two. The tostada nachos were delicious. We substituted the ground beef for the shredded chicken and it was incredible. The nachos are loaded! One of the great things I saw mentioned by other helpers was that the nachos never got soggy halfway through. This is very True, each bite, down to the last was just as fresh and crispy as the first.  With check-in, you get a free house margarita. I don't know what it was with this margarita....but it was damn near the best I've ever had. It was just a plain house margarita. Not sure if they make their own sour mix or not but it was just delicious. Even my girlfriend raved about it.  Prices were very fair for the location and portions of food. This place is a must try if you are in Vegas. This is also perfect late night munchie/drunken night food. Service was good, atmosphere was cool. We had a great time!",

Only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service from the hostesses wasn't good both times; it's like they couldn't be bothered.

It was about a 5 minute wait for the hostess to  sit a party of 6. The server's name was Mark and he quickly brought us some water and took our orders. Make sure to check-in  at the restaurant because your first house Margarita on ice is on them. The bar is a good size with plenty of TVs if you want to watch a sports game.  I decided to order the fajita mix of chicken and filet mignon for two. It comes with flour tortilla and plenty of cooked onions and peppers to stuff your taco. Overall the service was great, the food was good and prices were fair. Parking is a little tricky. I recommend uber or you can park by nearby garages for a certain price.",

We had such an awesome server! Her name was Shannon + she took really good care of us, constantly asking us if we needed anything. She was also really sweet and caring. When she found out we went to EDC, she told us to stay hydrated because of her bad experience a few years back. Luckily, this year the weather was so much cooler and we didn't have trouble with overheating. Good advice to stay hydrated in general though.   FOOD. My bf and I shared the lobster and crab nachos drizzled with white queso and serrano aioli. I only wish they distributed the toppings more evenly on top, but I guess it kept the other chips from getting soggy. I also think that the lobster and crab meat was a bit sparse. It felt like sometimes you were digging for buried treasure. Other than that, I really liked the flavors; it had a bit of a kick to it, probs from the sriracha + serrano aioli. Also, the tortilla chips were on the thinner side, so they might break on you if you load it with too much. I prefer the thicker chip myself but I liked how they were warm + made in-house.   I had a really fun experience here! They have tons of TVs to watch sports. The NBA Western Conference finals happened to be playing while we were there, so that was fun to watch. Highly recommend visiting for nachos + a margarita if you're feeling it!",

It came with shrimp, lobster and crab meat with a creamy queso, sriracha drizzle and fresh jalapenos. One of my favorites that was on the table but honestly, every nacho platter was yummy! From traditional to shrimp, to bbq chicken to pulled pork, I was not disappointed! Also, the drink specials were legit! We got there at 2pm and saw there were bottomless mimosas up until 3pm and then happy hour started at 3pm. You can eat and drink for a decent price and everything was delicious! GO GO GO!",

For an appetizer, we got the Triple Dip and it was really good. I didn't love the salsa, but the queso and quac were both really tasty, and the chips were bottomless which I appreciate lol. Plus, it's a really great option when everyone prefers different dips.   For lunch, I got the Flaming Shrimp (the one in the skillet). They were really good, but I'll admit not quite as good as I was hoping... my fiance got the BBQ Pork Nachos, and while the meat and BBQ sauce was really good, I have to admit we thought this sounded better than it actually was... and in retrospect decided BBQ and nachos maybe isn't the best combo haha.   For those reasons I gave this place four stars... buuut my sister ordered the Southwest Chimichanga appetizer and her boyfriend got the Fiesta Nachos and they loved theirs, so maybe we just ordered wrong!  Other than that, our waitress was really nice but often took a long time to check on us. They were busy though so she maybe just had a lot of tables. Overall this was a good spot, but I'm not sure we'd come back since we aren't in Vegas that often!",

Christina \"Tina\" advised us of special offers we might want to take advantage of.  She made great suggestions off the menu after hearing our dietary concerns. We learned that she was formerly from our home towns and had lively chats regarding our favorite sports teams, and the soon to be new home of the Raiders.  Enjoyed the food (generous portions and made to order). Fun place!!!",

Love the atmosphere of the place, the sign is bright and interesting and when you walk in they have a scorpion tank by the front desk, how cool is that!  The staff was wonderful, she took our orders quickly and was super nice to us.   Food took a while to come out but it was pretty good, not the best but still good. They added a little flair with the food presentation for the flaming shrimp taco where they lit it on fire in front of us.   Overall pretty good!",

The location is a little tricky to get to. It's not inside miracle mile shops or planet Hollywood. We parked at miracle mile and then walked through to go outside to Nacho Daddy. It's pretty big and fun inside. There's lots of TVs for those who are all about sports.   Our server was just great! He was so quick with taking our orders and getting our food out. The enchilada nachos are awesome. There's a lot of chicken and the jalapenos give it a nice little kick. The fajita bowl with steak was delicious. My daughter thought the fries were the best she's had. The kids menu has a nice selection for kids. I wouldn't recommend getting an appetizer of chips and dips if you order nachos. It's quite the chip overload. The dips are tasty but it's just a lot.   Since it was my birthday I got a free dessert. They promised not to sing to me but I got to choose what I wanted. I went with the fried ice cream nachos. So massive!!! I shared with everyone and we still couldn't finish it. The cinnamon chips were my favorite.",

It made for a great show, but the tequila aftertaste was not something I enjoyed. The rice and beans were good and it came with guac!!! The fries were some of the best I've ever had. Nachos were also delicious, but I was sharing so I only got a few. Service was also good - quick and a good amount of attentive.",

We ordered a mango margharita, the trio dip with chips, the steak tacos, and the lobster and crab tacos. First things first, I like the vibe and the atmosphere. It's a nice place to hang out in groups, and they have nice 90's songs playing int he background and the basketball game going on. A lil something for everyone. The bartenders were great and our cocktail tasted delicious! Then we moved onto the app. I absolutely loved the guacamole and the homemade chips! It was so good. The salsa was good but the queso dip was just okay and we ended up barely touching it. Then we moved on to our tacos. They were probably the least enjoyable. The steak was a bit overdone and dry. It could use some liquid or sauce on it. The lobster and crab taco was also okay. Both tacos were served with double corn tortillas which is usually my fave but it didn't work that well here. I saw some other people's dishes and it looked really good. I wish we had gotten some nachos instead. Overall we had a decent meal and the drinks were great but would come back to try other things instead.",

However you should not sell a pitcher of michelada if you don't know how to make it. Even the bartender said it was not his fav. After we pretty much asked for extra lime/salt/pepper shit they should just bring the ingredients and have the customers make their own. Anyways, as we where finishing up the bomb nachos... a lady on a date near us asked for a margarita, she took one sip and made a face, had a second sip and sent it back she said it was nasty. Her face said it all. I'm sure it's the same face we all made when we drank out of our micheladas. I just remembered there where 2 girls sitting at the bar they also ordered 2 micheladas they made a face when they drank out of it and left half of their micheladas as they left. Maybe you should reconsider the mixed drinks. Or hire someone to help you figure out the correct ratios for them.",

The funkiness of the cotijo cheese sits well with the corn's sweetness.   Knights Nachos were as good as a hat trick in a victory. Filet mignon was very tasty (marinated) and tender compared to any other \"steak\" nachos out there. 3 cheeses all over and the added sweetness of the sauted onions was a nice surprise. Peppers (green/ red) had good flavor and a hint of spice, bordering a philly cheese steak.(i mean that as a compliment) There were a few mushrooms thinly sliced and hidden in the nachos, would like more of that, good flavor and just wanted more.   Spicy Nachos - unfortunatley i didnt get too taste much because it was quickly devoured by my wife and daughter. The shrimp used was cooked appropriately, was anticipating an over cooked previously frozen shrimp. This may have been prev frozen but the texture was excellently firm.    I always have a shot or 3 of the Kimo Sabe Resposado on my visits.",

The restaurant is about a block from the strip, and is definitely walkable from the strip.  I ordered lobster and crab soft tacos (the priciest soft tacos they had on the menu...prolly coz of the seafood) and loved that the food wasn't heavy. The tacos tasted fresh and light...and unlike many other mexican places I went to where you felt sluggish, bloated and sleepy afterwards...I felt energized after eating those tacos for sure.  Prices were reasonable, especially given the fact that they are in close vicinity from the strip. The waitress was also attentive, too. She was friendly and worked to refill our sodas promptly and took care of bringing the bill at the right timing as well.",

Combine this with the fact that it was taco Tuesday, and off to Nacho Daddy we went.  It was a quick Lyft ride from the NYNY where we are staying.  I highly recommend taking grandma to Vegas with you to watch the kids at night!    We weren't really sure what to expect.  On a Tuesday night, Nacho Daddy was pretty mellow.  When we walked in, I noticed a huge terrarium just inside with giant scorpions as long as your middle finger.  Yikes!  Of course, my husband thought it was cool.  We decided to sit at the bar.  Our bartender was a cool kid who had been working there for a few months.  He was very helpful as we asked about the nachos and tacos.  We went with the carne asada nachos and three chicken tacos/three carnitas tacos for $5 each (taco Tuesday deal).  I can tell you that the nachos were legit, super delicious.  Tacos were very good as well.  Pork tacos were stuffed with carnitas.  Can't forget to mention the drinks - I had a margarita.  It was classic and came with the right amount of salt.  My husband is a daredevil and went with a tequila shot with a (dead) scorpion on it.  Why?  I don't know.  Apparently they buy these dead scorpions by the jar from Arizona and people actually eat them - as did my husband.  He also bought one for the bartender.  They are allowed to accept up to two shots per shift from customers, haha.  Definitely worth a stop!  Check out the giant scorpion and have some nachos.",

The menu was pretty extensive with a variety of nacho, taco, enchilada and fajitas choices.  After looking over the menu I decided to go with the filet mignon and shrimp fajitas. This place is known for its scorpion shot which features a real scorpion. I wasn't feeling that adventurous so I went with the Cadillac Margarita instead. The margarita was good and made with house made sweet and sour and premium liquor. The fajitas were served table side sizzling and what you would expect from a spot like Daddy Nacho. The filet was tender with a good portion of shrimp mixed with peppers, onions, jalapenos and cherry tomatoes. I was particularly pleased with the side of rice, refried beans, guacamole, lettuce and pickled onions that accompanied the fajitas. Overall a good spot that I'll be sure to visit again.   Tip: Check in on Yelp to receive a free house margarita.",

The portions  were huge and my first thought was we are never going to finish all of this but we did! Every chip had a topping not a pile of plain chips like you get sometimes in other restaurants.  We also enjoyed the free house margarita for checking in on Yelp and a few $5 happy hour margaritas as well.  I wish our visit was longer so I could have went back.  There was a whole page of vegan options that looked amazing.  It will be my first stop next time I'm in Vegas!",

I'm not sure if the buffalo chicken wasn't cooked properly or if buffalo sauce just doesn't go well with nachos. In any case, my recommendation is to never order it.  That said, this place isn't half bad, the drinks are decent and the waitresses were nice. I'm giving this place an extra star just because of the name.  I might give this place another chance if I stay at the Cosmo or any other hotel that's nearby.",

It was great. We ordered food and it took pretty long but i totally understand because it's so packed. But right when my friends got their food, i was told that they ran out of the food I ordered which was depressing because i wanted it. But they asked me if i wanted something else and I ordered another item. It actually took forever to get my food. I was told the kitchen is backed up like a few times. By the time i got my food, my friend were done eating. Our server, Mark. I think? He was being so cool about it and updating me what was going on and how he kept apologizing. He was honestly a great server. And i believe the manager there took care of our food. It really sucked what happened to my food and my experience there but Mark was being such an amazing server. He broke the scale for providing great service!",

I recommend it if you're looking for Mexican on the strip, not too pricey and tv's everywhere.   Make sure to check in and get the free margarita!",

    "text": "We stopped here for dinner because of the yelp check in (free house margarita with entree) and the close location to our hotel (Signature at MGM). We ended up coming here 3 times during our trip! They have happy hour on Monday-Friday 3-6, $5 margaritas and specials on other drinks/food  1. The frozen house margarita is awesome! Some previous reviews say it's not strong, but it was plenty strong for us, 28 & 30! ;p And not too sweet also.   2. My husband's favorite was the chicken enchilada nachos with both red & green sauce. I got the kale salad with shredded chicken 2 times! It was full of big pieces of veggies, a big salad, and the shredded chicken was great. For $10.50! We don't get great salads for that price in OKC.   3. For happy hour we got the mini BBQ chicken nachos & mini nacho average burger nachos. My husband really liked the nacho average burger nachos, meat seasoned well and lots of lettuce/tomatoes. The BBQ chicken had too much BBQ sauce for our taste. The toppings were good, just overpowered by the BBQ sauce.  Like I said, we made 3 stops here and I also bought a tank top with the silly nacho daddy on it. We will definitely return next time in Vegas!  Update: Returned to Vegas a year later and made 2 trips to Nacho Daddy again! We love this place! Can't get over how good the frozen house margaritas are!! I also love how they show music videos on some of the TV's while the song is playing. A lot of 90's-2000's music plays which appeals to us.   We tried some breakfast dishes this time. I had the the vegetable omelet - it was so good! Stuffed FULL of fresh veggies. Philip had the Bacon-cheese enchiladas rancheros. He said the bacon was amazing and enjoyed the dish.  Again, 5 stars for Nacho Daddy! Thanks for making our Vegas trips delicious! :)",

Hostess up front seemed really frustrated and didn't acknowledge us when we came up from receiving the text that we are ready to be seated and had not so good communication skills which is what the -1 star is for. Other than that, once we got seated, our server was nice, we got checked up a few times and the food was good! It was a chill experience. Honestly just reminded me of going to Buffalo Wild Wings or like Rock & Brews though. Pretty cool place. Good music.",

The staff was friendly and our waters were refilled while we were looking over our orders. I ordered some chicken shredded nachos.  The portion size of this nachos was gigantic.  No matter how hungry I was, I could not finish the dish at all.  It can easily be split between 2-3 people for the portion they served.  The nacho tasted okay.  I definitely had better.  The chicken was a bit dry tasting even with the sauce they covered it in.  I feel they loaded it up with more fillers like beans, cheese, sour cream then they did with the meat on there.  It was quite pricey for the dish itself, but then again this is LV. Expect to pay an arm and a leg for anything you eat in LV.",

Our sever Marty was knowledgeable about how the kitchen could accommodate most everything on the menu to be gluten free with the exceptions of refried beans and Mexican rice (they have GF wild rice). We enjoyed the fiesta nachos, chicken tacos, enchiladas, and lots of margaritas. We made it in time for happy hour and the $5 margaritas were amazing! If you check in on Yelp, you get a coupon for a free house margarita, which we were able to get to go (and it was huge). We didn't try the scorpion shot, but the concept is pretty cool.

The place had a cool vibe & atmosphere. As for the Nachos they were good, not great. I had the Filet mignon nachos, my wife had the lobster & crab nachos, and my girls had the Nino's Nachos (cheese & chips). Now when it comes to Nachos I feel like the star of the show should be the CHEESE. While I can truly appreciate the fact that they take pride in piling up your nachos to where you don't have a dry chip, but I felt like all the piling up of all the ingredients it was hard for me to taste the CHEESE. The toppings were all delicious, the beans, the filet mingon, guac, sour cream, salsa, etc...But the star of this show was the SALSA. Way too much. I found myself reaching over to my daughters to grab a chip because all she had on her nachos was their delicious cheese! While I didn't try my wifes nachos, they looked delicious and she seemed to really like them. Would I go back, absolutely! I would probably just specify how I would like my nachos, or order something different.",

I had not been here before so i was asking abot future visits and was surprise to lern  happy hour existed today ... The AGM and bartender were not very encouraging to recommend or offer it (They forgot it was available on Sunday) we receve good service from the runner an back waiter.. chips and salsa were great.. I, the customer, had to ask to order three times like i was begging to order a beer, begging to order an appetizer, then had to ask to order food... The AGM and staff was sitting at a table talking and thought we was smiling at the conversation they were having and I said no I am still waiting and wondering where the beer order that i placed 15 minits ago is... (only 2 people were belly up to the bar and the bartender was at the table with the AGM and not serving the tables)  the food arrived before the beers... Not cool when you are sitting in the cantina area and cood sell more alcohol if drinks were offered.. the vegan offerings were great.. We had to ask for to go boxes.. to go bag.. i had to bring the credit card to the bartender ... Now i understand why none of my friends in Summerlin want to come here and as to why the Henderson location has closed.. The food is good but the service is like Roberto's self serve.. Not impress.. The manager asked for us to write a review as i was thrill to arrive and was taking photos of the food with big expectations.. That was abruptly halted.. Absolutely i will post a review and share this poorly run Sunday restaurant in Summerlin... Sad when the big boss is off the staff does not pay attention to locals.. service.. or qwality... Food can only get you so far.. Kudos to ALEX and MARC awesome team members and they is the least paid staff and was not making direck tips... it was so poorly run I will be calling the corporate office on Monday as I think Mark Evensvold will be surprise to lern of how his restaurant is run... Yes manager I am happy to write a report - this is my first review ever on yelp that i has written and am sad that it was from a poor experience... I do not recommend and will probably not return even for $1.00 beer.. I wood rather pay more and be acknowledged... I take that back ALEX & MARC were great I wood want to return juss to thank them for a good example of hospitality and service... PS also do bathroom checks in the Ladies room.. I was to disgusted to even make mention over the disarray and was just redy to leave and post this report as it is fresh in my heart.",

All the hostess were sweet and nice and everything was good up until my friends' orders came out so I waited for my order which never came. Our server was busy waiting a large group that came in after us, which was understandable but time kept going and the table needed refills and my friends' were basically done eating their huge plates of food before we were able to flag down our server about what happened to my order. A huge platter of tacos went to that table he was helping. He said he'll let us know and then goes over to the big party. Basically takes care of that big party the whole time. He walks by and says it'll be out soon. It's been well over 40 minutes for two tacos with rice and beans by that time. My friends are stuffed and done with their food and I had to go, it's close to an hour now. So I flagged the waiter down and just politely asked if we could just cancel my order. He tells me it's literally done but we've been sitting there and everyone in my party is sitting there done while he's been serving that one large party. I  needed to leave so I just told him it's ok I'd rather not take it because I wouldn't be able to eat it or keep it on me. I'm not one to take home food either if I didn't buy food for the whole family. He comes back and inquires about why I don't wanna take it home so I tell him I have things to do and I don't wanna eat all of this in front of my family and he replies with \"so you don't eat in front of your family?\" Which was pretty rude so I told him well I'm not gonna sit there and have them watch me eat and not have bought food for everyone? I've waited so long for this food and literally everyone was finished and we had to move on. The place was not even busy. Plus I don't understand why a small order was suddenly done when I wanted to cancel it and he's being rude to me about it. Oddly enough after getting us our check he apologizes and says it's all his fault. But it's insincere because just a minute ago he didn't understand how I wouldn't want to take the food with me when there could be a number of reasons why and it's no ones business. I would've been fine if he just canceled it but having to explain myself and having his comments just really made a bad experience.",

    "text": "Every time I come to Vegas, Nacho Daddy is one of the first stops I make. And I always end up going multiple times! It's conveniently located on the corner of Harmon and S Las Vegas Blvd. Plenty of tables, bar seating, and easy to find.  If you're going on a weekend, they're open 24 hours and it's a perfect place to get late night munchies! During the regular week, they're open until 2am, which is still pretty nice.  Their drinks are hard core legit. There are plenty of pamphlets and coupons around the strip and at your concierge desk for BOGO or a free margarita and they're pretty famous for them. I like the fruitier ones like blueberry, strawberry, and mango. But their classic is a classic for a reason. And they are HUGE. They are also known for their scorpion shots, which has a pickled scorpion in a shot of tequil. never tried one, but I'm sure it's a real conversation starter. They also have a full bar, so no matter what you're in the mood for, they can probably do it. But you have to have a margarita at lwast once here.  Secondly, their NACHOS. They do not disappoint their namesake. Literally not a dry chip! all the cheese mixtures they use are so perfect and melt evenly on the chips. They have a number of meats and other toppings too, but I've yet to have a flavor combo that goes wrong. Last time we were here, we got the filet mignon golden knight nachos and it was heavenly.  We've also been here before for breakfast! I got the churro pancake. it was MASSIVE, came with syrup and caramel sauce, and had a hidden lining of churros and cinnamon toadt crunch. Honestly, it was a gluttonous feast. I didn't finish it though. My husband got the huevos rancheros and it was perfect. Corn tortilla slathered in eggs, cheese, salsa. The guac on the side was great too.  Some other great things about this place-- staff is always super friendly, there are a ton of TVs that are always playing music videos (sometimes hip hop, sometimes throwbacks, always fun), and they have a scorpion tank in the front of house. Best part is you get a quality experience for a quality price.  I. Love. Nacho. Daddy.",

Checked in on yelp and each got a free house margarita with our check in and a purchase of an entree. Margarita was delicious and wasn't a super small glass like you would normally expect for a free item.   We each ordered a nacho entree - I ordered the BBQ pork nachos and my boyfriend ordered the nacho daddy burger nachos (names might be incorrect) and they were AMAZING. The plates were huge and we stuffed ourselves into a nacho coma. The white queso and BBQ sauce on the pork nachos were the perfect combination. The fried onion strings on the burger nachos were delicious and they should also come on the bbq pork nachos.   With our margaritas being free, our bill total was $30 and those nachos filled us up for the entire day.   There are a decent amount of TVs so if you're trying to catch a sports game this is a good stop.  15/10 would highly recommend.",

The pickled red onions really made the dish. Really heavy and cheesey it needs the acid. I would have liked to have seen some cilantro or fresh jalapeno to break up the flavors a bit more. The marinade for the chix was great. The flavor of the Chipotle did stand out in the dish. I appreciated the queso fresco . I would have cut back slightly on the yellow cheese sauce. There chips were good and seemed to be house made. I liked the vibe and the place was buzzing. They were selling a lot of there famous scorpion shots, which looked like a shot of tequella  with a little scorpion inside. Not for me but it's a cool novelty. I had there pilsner and it was tasty. As a restaurant in Vegas it must be so hard to stand out because of the sheer volume of choices. I would come back here again. I may try a new  place first. I was not blown away  I feel like in Vegas you either need to be exceptional or novel to be successful. They have the novel down and there food is good. Thanks for a great night guys.",

This location was right around the corner from PH and had great reviews so I definitely wanted to check it out. The first night I got to Vegas I ordered take out from here and was not disappointed. My salad was ready by the time I got there which was great because I was tried from my travel. I ordered the mexi-cobb salad which I really enjoyed it. When I picking up my food I got to check out a bit of the ambience and it definitely had a fun environment. I came back the next day and ate at the restaurant. This time I order their fajita bowl and really liked that as well. They gave a good amount that I even took some back to my room.   Since I was there for work alone I brought a book to read while I waited for my food and have to say the staff was really attentive and friendly. They really made a solo diner feel welcomed and well attended to. I wish there was a location in the East Coast cause it would probably be one of my more favorite chain \"mexican\" restaurants.",

The best part was you get a free Margarita upon checking in on Yelp! Love the ambiance, fast service, convenient location, right outside Planet Hollywood hotel! Because the margarita was so good here, each of us (6 of us) decided to order another one to go!  Only in Vegas, you can take alcohol with you in a to-go cup, which is amazingggg!!! I absolutely cannot wait to come back here for mexican-style brunch!!",

It has a great ambiance, great service, it's clean, has a fantastic and extensive menu, a free margarita with Yelp check in and entree purchase, and the food is delicious!  I could just stop right there.  But, really, you can get any kind of nachos you want and they are bomb; great flavor combinations, quality ingredients, and truly the worst part is trying to decide WHAT you are going to choose.  I've personally ordered the BBQ pork nachos which were OMG so GOOOOD and my own creation from their Gold something something, that was basically filet mignon and cheese.  Yeah.  SO GOOD.  The standard Mexican nachos got all the goodies on them and the buffalo chicken nachos are literally everything you think about when you order buffalo wings, BUT ON NACHOS!  I have a friend that ordered the ceviche and she says 'YUM', but I thought the portion was a little small.  For the amount and quality of food you get, the prices seem reasonable.  When in Vegas, you MUST GO HERE TO EAT.  If you don't, you will be sad.  In fact, I'm sad that that we didn't got a second time on our most recent trip.  But, thank goodness, we'll be back in a month.  CAN'T WAIT!",

Loved the ambiance of the restaurant, very rustic! There are huge screens where they play video songs which was very cool.  Got seated in a couple of minutes and we unlocked a couple of House Margaritas with Yelp check-ins and the drinks were good. Also tried Daddy's Margarita which was very good. Ordered Vegan Spicy Burrito and Thai Chicken Bowl. Both the dishes were really good but the latter in particular was very different from the ones I have ever eaten in Thai restaurants. Had a subtle sweetness from the sweet chili sauce in the dish. Absolutely delicious! The food was quite filling leaving no room for dessert.  Rating the following out of 5:  AMBIANCE - 5 Amazing rustic charm!  FOOD- 4 House Margarita - 4 Daddy's Margarita - 5 Vegan Spicy Burrito - 4 Thai Chicken Bowl - 5  CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4  WAIT TIME - 4 It was a weekday and we went in pretty late in the night. Not much of wait time.  HYGIENE - 4  PARKING - Not sure about the parking. We walked down from our hotel. Parking in Vegas, especially the strip is a bit cumbersome so it is better to take Uber/Lyft.",

I am a big nacho fan and so far my favorite is the chicken enchilada nachos. The prices I feel should not exceed $12, but since they do provide a large amount (probably enough to share), maybe it's okay for some to be almost $20? What I like the most about Nacho Daddy and what makes it unique, is that it has vegan options. Although I am not a vegan, I have numerous friends that are, and it's good to know that I can take them to a restaurant that we both can enjoy. My most favorite experience that I have was the deep fried ice cream - it was outstanding!",

The staff is friendly, the place is clean and food comes out fast & hot.  Prices aren't bad, especially HH $5 menu from 3-6. Love that they are open late and early enough for breakfast.",

Music is loud and there are TVs everywhere. $92 for three people. I'd recommend the chicken quesadilla with kids and any nachos for their specialty",

The vegan chick'n was marinated in flavorful spices. Nice touch with the grill marks too. The pico de gallo and guacamole were fairly mediocre. The fajita pepper & onions added heartiness to the romaine lettuce. But the real standout ingredient was the onion thyme vinaigrette. Omg YUM! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2l68mbD&s=ea0161be60fb3342b8e38f9dd1944e2c41e7dc1721750b2d376ad754d5bd135e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2l68mbD</a>  The BF had to work at an in-town trade show so I was dining alone. This place was extremely empty at 11am on a Monday. Saw about two other single diners and one small group in this large restaurant. But the friendly waitress did provide great service and checked in on me often.",

They have embraced their scorpion theme with a giant scorpion terarium where you can watch them prey on little crickets, and they offer a scorpion shot that comes with a little baby scorpion in it.   Service was pretty blah. First they forgot our margaritas, then they forgot about 1/2 our order and had to come back to ask us what we wanted again. Good thing they did though because I wanted the vegan fajita bowl and they forgot it was even vegan!   Food came out and they forgot we ordered the garlic cheese fries, a side salad, no onions ina. Sandwich, and sour cream. So they had to go back and make it and bring back out.   Pretty slow service all around as well but there weren't that many people there.   would probably come back for late night drunk eats, and for the free margarita you get with a check in!",

We stepped in and as soon as we arrived they looked busy Katelyn the host was very friendly and told us it would be about a 10 minute wait. After about a minute or so The manager Joe approaches and asked if I had been helped and I said yes but is there anyway I could get a drink while I wait ? He said of course if you would like to grab a drink at the bar I will make sure to come and get you when your table is ready. I let him know I was 4 months pregnant ,he obviously couldn't tell and I felt weird sitting at the bar so he asked if there was something he could bring me? I asked for a virgin pina colada and a margarita for my boyfriend he said yes absolutely you sit there and relax and I will bring it over to you. Within a few minutes I had an awesome virgin pina colada with a huge whip Creamed topping and a cherry on top ! After a few minutes we were sat by Katelyn who chatted with us the whole way and said to enjoy our meal. Carly was our waitress and she is the sweetest ! She suggested the supreme nacho and the Thai nacho both were out of this world ! I was a little jealous of my boyfriend who got to do the scorpion shot which was creepy but they make you feel really special by ringing a bell , nacho daddy was so much fun and I wish I could have experienced that also. The whole staff was awesome and helpful I have never been blown away by a dining experience and quite honestly I didn't expect it . Kudos to management and the staff for the hard work and service. PS I don't yelp but Nacho Daddy is the reason I signed up! I can't wait to drop this baby and come back for a non virgin drink a plate full of nachos and that scorpion shot!! Please come to San Diego!!!",

The only reason for a 3 star review, is it took quite a long time for anyone to notice we were standing at the host stand to be seated.  Normally this wouldn't bother me even in the slightest, knowing that high volume restaurants get busy.  But as we were eating we overheard the table with sight of the front door, was full of employees there for a party, and quite a few standing at the bar who never let any of the employees on the clock know we were standing there.  A little disappointing.  But our waitress was very pleasant and quick to refill drinks.",

Chips are fine - thin, warm and crispy., you pay for a bottomless chips and salsa but they won't have time to refill it, because your wait staff will barely come by to check on you. The food was mediocre. Sharky's nachos taste better (and they don't have nacho on their name!) It was full consensus among my family members that we certainly won't wait in that line again. Service could be much better. One and done.",

It sounds like a gimmick to draw you in. We laughed at the name but glanced in and it seemed like a cool spot with open air and all we wanted was a snack to hold us over so it wasn't the end of the world if we had mediocre food.  Fish tacos sounded like a good option for a snack but the waitress upped the ante by suggesting the signature tacos because of the homemade tortilla. I can't possibly say no to that - I was game. And indeed, as she claimed, these grilled fish tacos on homemade tortillas were fantastic. What a great suggestion, one that got us to revisit this place a few days later.  What I will say about Nacho Daddy is that the service and hospitality was excellent in both of our visits. No one left you hanging - people came by right after we sat down but also checked in with us periodically to see how we were doing. This place was a pleasant surprise that was also convenient to our hotel.",

    "text": "I didn't stay long because I was in a hurry but the from the 5 star rating you can tell that I really enjoyed this place. I was visiting Vegas with my friends and wanted to stop by a place that had offered large amounts of food for an affordable price.   Before I even get to anything I want to say that if you check in with yelp you'll get a free margarita with the purchase of an entree. They'll include the tax on the margarita in your final bill but you're still saving around $12.  The interior of the place is sports themed and they have large TV's hung everywhere around the facility, which is nice because I didn't want to miss the NBA playoffs while I was busy eating. The atmosphere is very nice and they'll also have some sports music playing in the background.  Now onto the food. The food is huge. HUGE. I shared a filet mignon nacho with my friend and we were both full from eating it. The nacho itself costs around $20 but you have to consider just how large the thing is.  Finally, the waiting staff were fantastic and always attended to us whenever we needed anything promptly.  If I come to Vegas again, I will definitely stop by Nacho Daddy.",

This place fills up quick. By 6:30 the place was full of people. I think the prices were about right for a Las Vegas area place.

I ordered the Thai Chicken Nachos. so good. perfect flavor. The cheese was just enough. The Thai  flavor was on point and it was more than enough. Loved it.   My wife got some sort of seafood Nacho. It had lobster and crab I believe. it looked awesome and  there was more than enough.  we both had margaritas which were good and strong. my only regret is not doing the Scorpion shot. There server Alyssa was great.",

    "text": "In Vegas for the weekend to celebrate my birthday & see JLo. Hubby loves Mexican food so he did what everyone else does & checks out Yelp. We took a short walk from The Park MGM across the street to the location next to Buffalo Wild Wings. Thought we had reservations and discovered there are 3 locations. Luckily we got right in. At first I was not impressed, Hot & hangry I suppose. I thought damn it's hot in here & it better be good (what a biatch). Man, was I pleasantly surprised!  By checking in on Yelp, you get a free house Margarita in a mason jar. I am not a huge fan but it was very very good! We order the queso trio to start (fresh chips, hot queso, guacamole & salsa), then the mix & match fajitas (shrimp & filet mignon) came with all the fixins & beans & rice and Elote (off the cob). Thank God we shared! It was amazing from start to finish and Taylor B. our waitress was awesome (all the staff were very friendly & helpful). We ended our meal with a complementary churro sundae that was yummy! And.....for an added bonus we were able to watch The Golden State Warriors win the 2018 NBA World Championship!! We loved the place & we will be back!!",

We went on a weekday during lunch hours (I don't recall what day it was). We left FULL and happy.  The second time was the polar opposite. We were seated quickly which is the only plus unfortunately. It took about 10 minutes for the server to even acknowledge we were here. By the time she came, we all knew what we wanted. It took maybe 25 minutes to get our food after ordering despite the fact that it wasn't busy (Monday evening). Two of us ordered nachos and we had to request more cheese! Getting the check took a while too. Maybe it was a bad night.   So three stars for inconsistency!",

We started by sitting in the bar section and with in seconds Scartlett the bartender came to take our drink orders, I had my typical blue moon and my wife had a white peach margarita that Scarlett recommended, next she brought us chips and salsa and took our food order, I had the naked grilled wings buffalo flavor and my wife ordered the fillet Mignon nachos with in minutes our food was brought to us super hot and fresh as I took my first bite of the wing it just took me out of this world from all that flavor, next my wife tasted her nachos and her first word that came out of her mouth was OMG, the meat as my wife describes it was tender juicy and super delicious, drinks were absolutely amazing will definitely come back again.",

If you are with a group totally order maybe 2 or 3 nacho's they are a good size to share with the group. The BBQ Nacho is a sweeter bbq but still pretty good. My favorite that we had were the enchiladas nachos Grade A!!!  I was a little nervous to try to scorpion drinks but it was pretty cool seeing the tank full of scorpions when you first walk in!  The fried ice cream was ok... the chips that come with it make it alot better but the fried ice cream taste like it was rolled in cereal rather than actually fried... there wasn't any crunch which was a little disappointing but overall not too bad. I would just order ice cream with the chips that come with it if i ever get it again. scoop the ice cream with the chips!",

This place is LIT. And the prices are totally reasonable as well. Our server was RYAN. Really tall, like, building tall, like, 19ft tall. Great server, friendly, considerate, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended virtually everything since we had never been there before. His service (as well as the other staff we encountered) was an excellent 10/10. Commin back every time I'm in Vegas!!!",

Hot, flavorful, and not completely messy like other nachos I've had at other restaurants.  Everything was served to us quickly and Brittany checked on us frequently to see how we were doing. I had the spicy cucumber margarita and my husband had the Cadillac margarita. Both were tasty and prepared wonderfully.  We ended our meal with the deep fried ice cream! Ugh, best decision ever. Perfect amount of sweet to end a meal.   If you're looking for authentic Mexican food this is not the place. If you're looking for a twist on Mexican American food, this is absolutely your new to go stop.    P.S. The last time I visited I ordered the Thai bowl. Omg it was amazing.

The entrees, Crab & Lobster Enchiladas and the Baja Combo, were stuffed with deliciousness and very flavorful! And ohhhh...say yes to the Watermelon Margaritas (when in season)!

At the time, our server wasn't around, however one of the bartenders nearby approached our table and she handled it very well.   She was very empathetic and she quickly replaced my meal with what I actually ordered. She also asked me if I would like a courtesy drink. I wish I got her name. Thank you for making my visit so much better. :)",

The music was a little \"off\" for my family's taste and it's a bit on the pricey side. But what isn't on the strip ? I had the Vegan Spicy Burrito and my sister had the Vegan Chimichanga. We LOVED our food! Very satisfying and everything you dream of for vegan Mexican food. The grease, spiced rice, great salsa, and a good tortilla. I've tried other veganized Mexican foods and have been disappointed several times. Looks like I've found new contender for the best vegan Mexican food. My advice: Save your money, skip the sofritas at Chipotle and try this place out ASAP.",

It was terrific. Came with beans and rice. Just the right portion for lunch. Not too small/not too big. The pork was delicious. My colleague got the veggie burrito which he liked a lot as well.   And the meal was only $12. I paid more than that for coffee and a breakfast sandwich at Starbucks in the hotel.    I'm so bummed though. I didn't realize until I finished my meal that I had a free margarita with check in on Yelp :). Not that a margarita for lunch mixes well with work, but one can always dream.",

Now the food, it was our first time here, it's located off the strip so it wasn't that busy which was nice. We ordered the Pork Nachos and the Queso, and Guacamole for the appetizer, they were delicious. The only complaint i have is for the price they could have loaded up on the nachos and more pork.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Street Tacos and they were delicioso. They loaded those tacos up with meat, by the 2nd taco I was full, with the 3rd taco I was stuffed. If you like tacos order these!!!",

The nachos were not that great as I thought they would be. They look great since they give you such a big portion, but they get so soggy towards the center that can't really eat it without a fork.    Overall the experience was good and the restaurant had a fun vibe.",

They have a novelty drink that is a shot of mezcal with a vodka soaked scorpion so of course we tried it and it was great. You get to keep the glass. Our server Eric was a real nice guy that was on his third day working there and we were his first big table to all order the shot. Everyone loves their food. My order was the only one at the table that was incorrect twice but they made me a fresh meal both times till they got it right. I didn't complain and they were very kind about it. Just a mix up nothing major. All in all a great night. We will be back again and again. The management here does a great job and I hope they all keep it up.",

I was so happy to see an extensive vegan menu. I don't know what to do with that kind of choice. I went the nachos route, and it was a huge portion of pretty good vegan toppings. I got the free house margarita with the Yelp check-in, and it was surprisingly bad. I didn't drink much because it was too sweet for me, but my friends thought it was too sour so we left it behind. They seemed to like their upgraded margaritas.  Service was good, and I was surprised how calm the restaurant was on a Friday night. Apparently, Super Bowl Weekend in Vegas isn't the rager I thought it would be.  Bonus feature: the TVs had the kind of videos from the '90s and '00s that I'm nostalgic for: Rancid, Incubus, etc. No boy bands.",

When they say \"Never a dry chip\" they mean it!  I for one, hate a plate of nachos where half of the chips have nothing on them.  Not here folks. Second meal was the Daddy's Bowl.  Very hefty portion and good flavors. Chips and guac were pretty good, too. The peach margarita was tasty, but I'd skip their house margarita, its a bit on the sour side. Service was great.  Shout out to my server Huck!!  He's the man when it comes to providing excellent service.  He made great recommendations and took good care of me.  Happy belated birthday!",

They re-did my moms Bloody Mary when there was too much spice and tabasco and they were so kind to re make it so my mom could enjoy it. Would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!",

Ruben came to our table and advised my daughter that he would cook something similar to what she wanted... This guy is over the top!!! My daughter was so happy that he took the time to cook something that was no longer on the menu... The burger of course was delicious... The food, atmosphere and of course the service is incredible!!! We love the nachos, appetizers, tortilla soup and burritos... We all agree that whenever we are in Vegas this is the spot that we will always go to... WE LOVE IT!!!",

Not a crazy fan of mexican food I was pretty amazed that I finished 2 Vegan Chicken tacos all by myself and it was actually extremely flavorful!  One of the best part about Nacho Daddy is that they have a band playing from different time slots and a extremely cool Scorpion tank when you walk into the restaurant. I was even fortunate enough to see a scorpion devour a cricket right before my eyes! It was oddly satisfying !",

Didnt see ANY server with name tag, So I'm not sure who our server was. But you could tell by the way she waited on , not just OUR table, but her other guests as well, she didnt wanna be there. Had to ask for refills. Took forever to get get food. And no, they werent busy. Finally got our food. And not once did she come by to ask of we needed anything... (We did)  But because we already had to ask for refills on our drinks and she never made eye contact with is. We just did without. The General  Manager did come by and asked how we were doing. He got us refills. My wife did mention the bad service we were getting and he just saod \" sorry\"  And brought our to go boxes. Then the server decided to come ask if we needed anything. At that point we just wanted the check so we could go. Spend $60 on ok food and bad service. We'll stick with Lindo Michoacan!",

Luckily she did tell me about the taco and drink specials - 3 tacos for 5$ - YAY and 2 for 1 top shelf tequila!  Yay again!

First place that we've seen that serves filet mignon in their nachos and fajitas which defines high quality. The atmosphere was so much fun and the services were extremely friendly. The free margarita due to our check in was an added bonus. This will be our go to spot from now on for our Vegas trips!!",

    "text": "So first impressions: Vegan food has an actual menu! Most vegan options are pretty limited on the strip, but they have chick'n \"meat\" and the flavors are very well done. Looking for vegan options on the strip was limiting me to Wahlburgers for the impossible burger and fries. So when I saw this menu? I was in!   We ordered the chicken fajita platter and the special chick'n chimichanga. Both were vegan, although my dinner date didn't care for the black beans or wild rice. The flavored were good, and the unlimited chips and salsa have a good flavor. I liked their guacamole, it was really fresh and well flavored. I don't think the beans and rice were terrible enough to knock off a star, and the service was good, but a little slow. I liked the flavors, and the food was plated nicely and had good portions. I didn't the nachos, but they looked PHENOMENAL. Next time it's nacho time!   Entrees were about $15, and a small appetizer with two waters made it a big meal. Overall, $45 with a 20% tip for two wasn't bad at all.",

I didn't think we would end up going, but it was actually our first meal this trip in Vegas!  First and foremost--this place was HARD to find. It was listed as being in the miracle mile mall, but you actually have to enter from outside. Once we were outside, getting back to planet hollywood was no issue at all, but yeah, just a good note. If you are coming from the strip and facing the walgreens attached to the mall, you want to go down the block on the right, i think its 2 blocks.  We started off with a pitcher of skinny spicy margaritas. That isn't on the menu, but they were able to do it for us which was legit. Those margaritas were good and a great way to get the weekend rolling.  We had vegetarian queso, quite tasty. I wanted to get nachos with also ordering queso, I figured I should reign it in and I got Chick'n tacos. Anytime I can get fake meat at a restaurant I do, and this did not disappoint.  Very much recommend for a fun, casual meal.",

As vegetarians, we don't always like to order from the vegan menu because we like cheese and sour cream.

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I love nachos. When we were visiting Vegas, we couldn't pass up going to Nacho Daddy. When you walk in, there is a big scorpion tank. It's fun/creepy to watch while waiting for your table. It was a Friday night and we were seated within 5 minutes.  The service was great. Everyone was friendly. Waitress was attentive and our drinks were always full. For food, I shared the Fiesta Nachos with my mom. Definitely enough for 3-4 people. I'm not a huge guacamole fan, but Nacho Daddy's guacamole was the best I've ever had. The nachos were obviously delicious.  It was my birthday so they gave me a complimentary tequila shot. I also ordered the churro sundae which was phenomenal. It was a great atmosphere with yummy food. I'd recommend visiting while in Vegas.",

It was a little on the expensive side ($15+),but of course if you're eating on the strip you shouldn't expect to get out for under that.    The food came out pretty quick and it was decent.  The meat was flavorful, the guacamole was also solid.    My main issue is that like any place on the strip, if you drive 7 or 8 blocks to the East or West, you can get better food for less.",

    "text": "A very meh place. Nothing horribly wrong, but I wouldn't go out of your way to come here. I got the chicken tamale and checked in on Yelp for a free house margarita. Our waiter told us to upgrade to the larger size for only $2-$3 for a higher grade of tequila, which 2 of my friends ordered. Here are my thoughts...  Chicken tamale: 3 stars. COMES WITH CILANTRO (not marked on the menu). It was definitely not the best tamale I've had. Not awful but I love tamales and I couldn't finish this one. It was too salty but not flavorful, if that makes sense. It lacked taste, and the salt only made it worse.   House margarita: 5 stars. Tasty and adequately alcoholic. The tequila in the house margarita actually tasted better than the upgraded one my friends got. This seemed more alcoholic as well.  Upgraded margarita: I can't rate this as I didn't order this but my friends said the tequila didn't taste good and it was barely alcoholic. Stick to the house margarita!  Service: 1.5 stars. Our waiter was nice but ohhhh my god was he slow. It took him 20 minutes to grab our bill, then another 20 to figure out how to separate our checks. My biggest complaint was his response to me not realizing there was cilantro on the chicken tamale. I specifically checked the menu to make sure cilantro wasn't listed, as for many other food items, it was on the description as an ingredient. When I told him I can't eat cilantro, he said \"you should've told me this when you ordered\" and he annoyedly took my plate back. Pretty sure all they did was scrape off the mound of cilantro on top, as I could still taste it and saw bits of it in my food when I got it back. Waiter has a point that I could've mentioned this, but he could've been nicer in his tone and the menu was misleading.  Would not come back, but if they're still running the Yelp deal for a free house margarita, sure, come here I guess...",

However, Burrito by itself tasted bland and had more tofu taste. Spicy sauce is very spicy so be careful. Veggie Loaded Nacho was good. Not great though! Enchiladas is good. However, my in-law had ordered some chicken plate and was very dry and we had to replace it with another enchilada. First it took them a while to get his order out and then to find it was all dry. Then by the time enchilada came, not much hunger or mood left! However, their dessert dried ice-cream was really good. The cancelled item showed up on the receipt and we asked them to cancel it which they honored.  Friendly customer service. But overall food was okay. Definitely try their Fried Ice-Cream! 1 Spicy Burrito = $12.95 1 V.

The food was great so I recommend NOT eating at the bar, the bartender seemed too overwhelmed by her responsibilities or she just didn't give a crap about someone who wasn't drinking and just wanted to eat,  Sit at a table and you will be OK",

Not only do they have 1 whole page of vegan options which is phenomenal, they also had some super interesting and different flavor combos (chicken tinga, Philly cheesesteak, lobster & crab, etc.) and they all come on a cute cast iron skillet. I got the Thai chicken nacho - plenty of chicken, wonderful sweet chili sauce, pickled jalapenos, heaps of ooey gooey delicious white queso and house-made spinach chips that didn't get soggy even towards the bottom of the pile. They also have their own beer which was tasty too. I really wish I had one closer to home!",

Me and my family were looking for a quick bite to eat before a concert and the wait wasn't super long at 5:00pm on a Friday. So we decided to give it a try. Not to mention that it has good reviews.   I guess I will tell you about the positives. The vibe is super cool. The restaurant was clean and the service was friendly. They also blasted old 90's music videos which were fun to watch and listen to.   The food on the other hand was not that good at all. Like seriously, it was not yum. First off, chips and salsa aren't given to the table. They were an appetizer for like $5.  I feel like complimentary chips and salsa are a must.   I ordered the California burrito and it luckily came with chips and salsa. Too bad they came out with my meal and not before. The burrito was cold and the green sauce it was smothered in tasted like water that was colored green. It was also cold. The chips were over salted. I left with a slight stomach ache.   I will not be back anytime soon.",

A few months ago, I would have given this a full 5 stars, this is mostly a 4.5, but that's because they knocked off my favorite menu item:  Moco Loco Nachos.

They were probably the best vegan nachos I've had (or a close second to a place called Chive in Michigan), and would fool most anybody who didn't know better. It was also probably the first time I had nachos where there were more toppings than chips -- good shit.

    "text": "For vegan food on the strip, Nacho Daddy is certainly one of the better options. They feature a whole separate vegan menu, which is a lot more than can be said of most restaurants. But not only that, the food is actually pretty good!  I've now been a couple times, but was most impressed with my more recent dining experience. My co-worker and I went here for lunch during a conference. However, we got sort of lost/side-tracked on the way there. Nacho Daddy is not really part of a mall, but if you head through the Miracle Mile mall it will eventually spit you out right next to Nacho Daddy. I was first annoyed and frustrated that this appeared to be the only way to get to this part of the street. However, note if you keep heading towards Harmon from the strip you CAN get to Nacho Daddy without going through the mall. There is a small gap for a pedestrian walkway, but very easy to miss. Don't make our mistake and walk through that awful mall.  Coming for lunch on a weekday, the place had plenty of open seating (both outside and in). We got seated and started being served/assisted by a super friendly dude with a mohawk. I ordered the avocado beer battered tacos, and we shared an order of chips and guac. For the latter, maybe it's just because I've been temporarily based out of the east coast for a year and a half, but these chips tasted damn good. The tacos were also good, but I have had better (specifically, better beer battered avocado tacos). I think they needed better garnishing, etc. and possibly a more flavorful sauce. Still they were good, and also nice to be able to add some beans/rice on the side to fill out the meal.  Additionally, I ordered one of the house Nacho Daddy beers, this one being a hoppy pale. I was actually pretty impressed with it, though again, perhaps my judgment was skewed by what is normally a terrible beer selection on the strip.  The only downside, but not really avoidable in Vegas, was the priceyness of the food. But you're going to overpay on everything in Vegas, so not much you can do there.  While there are many vegan options in Vegas as a whole, it's nice to have something like this on the strip so you don't need to leave for every single meal.",

We were quoted a 15-20 min wait.   Our party of 13 was seated in a secluded back corner which was great because the busy restaurant was quite loud. We had a very private meal among our party. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free house margarita or you can upgrade to a specialty  margarita for an additional fee.    My bf and I ordered the Filet mignon nacho and chicken quesadilla. The filet mignon nacho was alright. It was very big that can be shared with multiple people. We forgot to tell them no beans so of course it came with refried beans, sour cream, guac, pico de gallo, cheese, etc. I think it wasn't very flavorful...a bit bland...and the chips were soggy halfway through eating it.   The chicken quesadilla includes shredded chicken but they were able to sub the chicken to cubed chicken for an additional $3. The quesadilla came with fries and the fries were good...a bit salty though....but good! The quesadilla was mediocre...it came with guac and sour cream. The plate was actually pretty big and could have probably been shared as well.   The filet mignon nachos were $20 and the quesadilla was $13. I would say the deals are pretty great! But wished the food tasted better. The service was alright...with our big party, I understand if our server was swamped.",

Hefty dollar sigh for a plate of nachos which was huge but still ... its just nachos at the end of the day. Split it with a friend, ordered a couple other appetizers which were ok, but I get it it's on the strip.   Im not much of an alcohol drinker, but this seems like a fun place to sit down with friends and drink a beer or two.",

    "text": "Vegan/Vegetarian review: 4.5 stars             Eating vegan on the Vegas strip is not an easy feat. After shuffling through tons of eateries on the strip, Nacho Daddy seemed relatively centralized, appetizing, and decently priced. So I and a couple of meat eaters ventured over to the joint as it was my turn to pick a place where I had more to eat than a lousy salad and fries. Sure enough, Nacho Daddy provided an extensive vegan menu of nachos, burritos, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, fajitas, and salad bowls that left me at a lost as to what to pick from this massive list.  Not being a risk taker, we played it safe and got:  Vegan Chicken Nachos - 4.5/5         Traditionally loaded, with everything you could possibly think that would go on nachos, came on this dish... Protein (marinated chickn), beans, guac, pico de gallo, salsa, bell peppers, roasted corn, onions, mushrooms, and vegan queso with spinach chips (nothing special)         The chickn taste like store bought gardein strips. While not unique, I'm still grateful!  The cheeze is decent, and all the fixings were pretty good all together. It's nachos, so while it's easy to make delicious, it's hard to stand out!  As a vegan dish, the True test is the \"cheese\", and its flavor and texture. Although I knew it wasn't real cheese, it was still pretty tasty and a decent sized portion was given. My only ding is the lack luster vegan chicken.   Fillet Mignon Nachos (GF) - 3.5/5           A little less loaded on these guys... These house made standard tortilla chips are loaded with beef, refried beans, sour cream, ranchero sauce, guac, pico de gallo, and a mixture of cheese.           The meat eaters said that the fillet mignon pieces were scarce and a bit dry. They even admitted that the vegan chicken version looked more appetizing. XD But, they said theirs was still decent, because who doesn't like nachos!?  Haha  I had to go down in rating on their behalf, but stuck with the 5 stars for the massive vegan menu (despite not being a vegan place), not charging extra for the 'vegan' title, generous amount of food, and friendly service, although a bit slow.   I need you guys to be in business when I visit,  so 5 stars it is :D",

Nacho Daddy great reviews....well they almost lost our business when it took us 29 minutes to get a beer at the bar. No it wasn't busy!  Meanwhile they lost 3 potential customers during the same wait at the bar and lack of acknowledgment, on a Sunday afternoon. However, patience does preserver, we saw how slow the bartender was moving and ordered a bucket of beers, and put our order in once we got her attention. Well we got the beers, server forgot to place our food order, oops!! We were determined to experience what all reviews were saying. We did finally get the right order and wow INCREDIBLE!! Imagine how much more they could impress overall and grow demand if they could fix who hires and trains the staff. Food incredible but sad how much we saw them lose out on due to poor staff training. NACHO Daddy has great potential. We will return but be prepared for long delays in order to get the incredible filet mignon nachos.",

Generous portions and a real value for the Strip. I also liked the coffee. They serve French Press. So I was able to get three cups out of it and feel like I was awake after a long night staying up. I highly recommend this place and it's a great place to relax and get off the beaten path. Everyone at the restaurant was attentive and friendly. Huge plus, the place is extremely clean and spacious!! Thank you Nacho Daddy!!",

Ceviche was tasty and very fresh. Only thing is I think there's to many chips for the serving. Picture to follow. Kids nachos were big portion we added chicken to them which was very good. Quesadilla was not very tasty. Needs to have less cheese and more crisp tortilla. It taste more like oil. Our server Gio was friendly and upbeat! Made good conversation and took care of us. Overall it's a good place to eat as a family. Lots of tvs and we got the Sunday night game after asking the GM! When we asked a server passing by he came back saying the owner wanted to watch the hockey game. So when he came by asking what could he do to make our expierence better we asked for the Sunday night game which he said ok to. We thought it was wired when we got the first response. Glad they decided to put it on.",

I didn't get it wrong. First of all it is her responsibility to get it right and her accent was thick and she was talking fast so I didn't pay attention to what she was saying. She and the server were seen arguing over whose fault it was and she said she was going to talk to the manager. You'd think the manager would come by and apologize or at least take the chips off our bill or something small but nothing was done. Mistakes happen and the waitress was sweet to us and apologized however the 3 stars is for the managements lack of attentiveness to customers.",

Don't let the word vegan scare you off, it was all about the chocolate.    BTW loved our server DJ!",

(Note that if you're looking for it, it does not connect to the inside of the shop area - it only has an outside entrance.)  Yayyy they had their scorpions stocked! I had been to the downtown location over a year ago looking for the scorpion shots, and they had run out of scorpions. I was so psyched to get to try them this time, and the location so convenient.  The bartender recommended a really smooth silver tequila - I can't remember what it was. It came in a double shot, totaling $14 I think. Totally worth it! However... I did not dare eat/swallow the scorpion. I was not that adventurous. I totally disappointed everyone in the restaurant who watched when they heard the bartender ring the bell (they do that to bring attention to someone buying the scorpion shot). Oh well, I got my photo and experience of having a dead scorpion in my mouth for a few seconds! Haha.  OH YEAH and they have a vegan section fo their menu I never knew about. Since I am trying to have the majority of my meals plant-based now, this will be great for me!",

    "text": "To whom this may concern:  *Fellow Vegan friends, beware of the lack of menu knowledge from Nacho Daddy's staff members*  Literally at loss for words. Yesterday My vegan friends and I went to Nacho Daddy for lunch, not only because they had great yelp reviews but also because of the accommodating Separate vegan menu they offered. Between the 3 of us we ordered, the Vegan avocado tacos, The vegan chicken bowl and A VEGAN CHIMICHANGA! As the chimichanga was served to the table my friend had cut the end piece to find out that the \"Vegan chicken\" was shredded. To our surprise we all had never seen \"Shredded vegan chicken meat\" so to be on the \"safe side\" we politely called our waitress over to ask her about the inside of our chimichanga, she reassured us that the meat WAS VEGAN and that it was house-made and delivered from a outside commissary daily. Because of the reassurance WE ATE THE ENTIRE BURRITO! In fact, We were so impressed by our faux meat vegan burrito that we anticipated ordering some again later that evening. As I ordered 3 vegan chimichangas to go expecting the same burrito I had ordered earlier.. I come to find out it was completely different. It had black beans, corn and rice... and NO shredded vegan chicken...hmmmm...I called in to verify if there may had been a possible miscommunication, but when I talked to the manager Edward (who also claimed to also be vegan) he told me that the burrito with the shredded chicken WAS NOT VEGAN. I repeat, NOT VEGAN!!! I even checked the receipt from earlier that day and it said \"V.chimichanga.\" So either it was the kitchens mistake or she grabbed the wrong burrito. Regardless, WE asked her... she saw us eat it.. and she reassured us!! Edward apologized and said that he would replace the burritos but honestly, I am just completely disgusted. Eating meat goes against everything I believe in. It goes against my personal faith and beliefs. I can cry right now because I feel cheated. I spent $100 on a lunch, to be swindled into eating a burrito filled with dead carcass. I no longer have faith in Nacho Daddy. My friends and I never ever step foot into this establishment again!",

They have over a dozen different options where it is more than just changing a topping a two.  We started with the queso dip.  This was actually one of the best ones that I have had.  It was a nice portion and the unique aspect was that it was set up almost like a fondue holder having a flame underneath to keep the cheese melted.  We then had an order of the spicy shrimp nachos and the smothered burrito.  Both hit the spot!  The nachos are definitely big enough for 2 to share and be more than filled.  This isn't going to be fine dining by any means but if you are looking for something above fast food Mexican at a reasonable price this is a solid option.",

Between 5 of us, we were barely able to finish 3 of the nacho orders... they were HUGE! Affordably priced (for anything on the strip), and delicious. Great place to watch any games going on, as they have a lot of sports screens up all around the restaurant. They are known for their scorpion shot and even have a scorpion tank up front.   Nachos had a great ratio of chip to toppings. They advertise \"never a dry chip\", and that was completely accurate. The group favorites were between the BBQ Chicken and the Filet Mignon nachos. Both were loaded with toppings and also were pretty different from each other. There are quite a bit of varieties to choose from. They even have dessert nachos!  Great sports bar atmosphere; nice break from the frenzy of the strip.",

I definitely felt like a \"weasel\" (Encino Man reference) lol! I actually swallowed the first one, but the second one refused to go down then  lodged in my throat and I coughed that baby up lol. It's definitely something all tequila drinkers must try at least once. The best part about the booth were the ladies behind it serving up these concoctions, especially Rebecka (awesome personality and great attitude) to whom I'll be paying a visit to soon at the Miracle Mike Shoppes during happy hour Monday's from 3-6 PM.

It is awesome as they make a full display of lighting the fajitas on fire at your table!  Pure fun!  The fajitas for two came with a full compliment of rice, beans, and guacamole.  You could get sour cream as well, but we opted for more guacamole.  The steak was excellent and plenty of grilled veggies to fill the tortillas.  The dessert was an apple nacho display and it was tasty.  Service was perfect even though it was very busy.  Tip - this restaurant is located on the outside of the shops at Planet Hollywood.  We made the mistake of going into the shops and got a little lost.   Overall, an excellent meal.  If I lived here, I would come back for the nachos next time.",

She was courteous and fast with our order. She explained to us about ordering the edible SCORPION and the extra cost to any drink.  Our nachos were enough for two so we shared them with others. They were real good. The scorpion, we were advised to chew it and not swallow it whole, tasted like tequila. On top of the great service they added a 20% military discount.",

We were able to grab a seat right near the hostess stand to wait. When seated we were greeted by our server Litzs who gave us a warm welcome. We were seated in a more quieter section of the restaurant which was nice. Thanks to a yelp check in, we got a free house margarita to start with. For the appetizer we got the queso dip and added ground beef. I could've eaten that all night! The presentation was very cute in its own little pot over a tea candle. The chips were fresh and Litzs even brought us a refill on chips! They made a great snack the next day. For entree I went with the surf and turf tacos. The lobster was yummy and the steak was well marinated. My rice was a tad cold but nothing to really whine about. The beans were nice too. My sister went with the ground beef enchiladas and again presentation was great! She was pleased with her meal as well. Both entrees were filling and we had the gumption to have a second margarita. We both went with the white peach frozen. I was too full to finish mine but it was quite tasty! Lastly we went for the churro sundae. My sister didn't love the raspberry but I enjoyed it. Kinda wished we had more churros to go with the ice cream but still good! Definitely looking forward to returning next time we are in town! Ask for Litzs she's great!!",

Then I got on Yelp again because they said if I ordered any food items they would give me a on house margarita  but guess what only if you order another item which is a appetizer why didn't they say that or why didn't the yelp advertising say free margarita but only if it it's purchased with a appetizer please be specific. I don't mind paying but please explain to out of towners. Bottom line your staff is not very friendly or helpful.",

I had the tostada nacho and my husband got the burger one. I didn't taste his, but he said his was good. I know mine was really good; I can't stop thinking about it. I also had the Daddy's margarita and found that to be really tasty and refreshing.  Overall, great experience for those that are absolute nacho fanatics like myself. Would I come back? Yes!!",

    "text": "Walking downtown Las Vegas, we decided to get something mexican. The choice was made fairly  easy, considering review/stars rate.  I had vegetarian chimichanga, while my gf got shrimp tacos. Let me go over my thoughts on every one of these very briefly. So Vegetarian Chick'n Chimichanga is based on soy-chicken, as well as a bunch of 'vegetarian' options on the menu, but my first question is, why are you trying to make vegetarian option be a substitution for meat in how it looks or tastes, if there are a plenty of great vegetarian stuff you can put into a chimichanga?! Most of the places I've been to offer tofu or chiles rellenos inside.. Second thing, way too much chopped onions. Chimichanga was topped with something like pico de gallo, but the main ingredient was.. well, you may've guessed:) Now, okay I can understand that there are no chips and salsa offered once you take a seat as most places do, but it wasnt even offered aside the entree..  I'd say I took a half of a star for what mentioned above.  In general, chimichanga was just fine. As to the grilled shrimp tacos, there were no complaines here, however there was nothing remarkable as well. They were nice and solid. I took the second half of a star for service. Although our server was trying to be nice, it was quite obvious she wasn't doing fine. She was placing dishes on the table while just walking by, did not even turn to us while serving, no 'enjoy' wishes nothing like it. Nothing offensive, of course, but I would've suggested be a little friendlier, life is great!)",

The mimosa came in a mason jar, nice! However the juice they use isn't very tasty and takes away from the drink. Really nice space and nice decor. I'd come back to try the lunch/dinner.

    "text": "We ordered a combination dish with 1 taco and 1 enchilada with red sauce, the filet mignon nachos, and the elote appetizer. First, the corn (elote) was off-the-cob and just dressed with the usual elote flavors. The corn is not Green Giant corn but actually fresh corn, but it wasn't sweet. Not-sweet corn = not-great elote.  The filet mignon nachos were pretty pricey and looked really huge when it came out, but it is definitely do-able for 2-3 hungry people: the large chips piled on top of each other make it look like a lot more food than it is. It's extremely saucy and wet, and there were no dry chips, as promised. It tasted pretty good, and if I were to come back to this restaurant, I wouldn't mind having it again. We asked for extra pickled jalapenos and chopped fresh jalapenos, and they were happy to oblige.   The tortilla that they use for the taco looked homemade, but it was a little too thick and bulky for my tastes. It was as thick as a pita. lol. I did not like the enchilada's red sauce - that was a pass for me...it was kind of bitter and not really enjoyable.   Overall, it's a completely gaudy, inauthentic mexican joint that fits in perfectly on the strip. The service was decent, the food was decent, and the location was prime. Would I come again? Yeah, I wouldn't mind....just don't tell my foodie friends.",

    "text": "We went here for a late dinner on April 16th. We were greeted by a super friendly host and seated within 5 minutes.  We ordered the Mexican Corn as an appetizer! I LOVE elotes! So, I was excited to try this. It was very delicious. The corn was crisp & sweet. There was a light taste of cheese & spice. Nothing heavy or overwhelming. I could've ate it all myself. But, I was good and shared  So, that may be something to think about... The Mexican Corn appetizer is only portioned for 1-2 persons! We ordered the Flaming Fajitas for two. We got the mix and match, so we ordered the shrimp & the filet mignon. They bring it table side and flame it up! Our waiter told us it was time to bring the camera out for videos or picture. We said we are just ready to eat... and he lit it up. So if you have pyrophobia, you may not want to order this. Hehehe The fajitas proteins come in a skillet atop grilled veggies. It comes with a side of rice and beans, and two generous scoops of guacamole & sour cream. I would've loved more rice, though! And more corn tortillas... My hubby doesn't like his meat well done. So he thought it was dry. It was flavorful but chewy. The shrimp was cooked to perfection.  We left full and satisfied. And we'd love to return again when we are in the area.  Funny story: The table next to us wanted to go catch a smoke while they waited for their entrees. So the waiter said he'll need to hold onto their credit card. The second both the waiter & couple moved away from their table, the busboy cleaned up everything within a minute. The waiter came back mortified. And he let the couple know right away and got them new drinks once they sat back down. FYI: Possibly fake news! But, my hubby heard that you can get married at the Taco Bell Cantina and the get a divorce at Nacho Daddy. LoL",

When I see a place that has over two thousand great Yelp reviews, I come with high expectations. Well Nacho Daddy did not disappoint!! I sat at the bar, and received wonderful service. I ordered a pomegranate margarita while I waited for my food. It was strong enough and a decent size for the price--it almost didn't make it as my dinner drink! But man oh man, when my food arrived, words can't describe the lust that was in my eyes. I was greeted with such a beautifully presented plate dancing with steam and reeking of sinfully delicious smells. After my first bite, it was pure love.   I ordered the Baja Seafood Platter, which consisted of their signature fish taco, a lobster and crab enchilada, refried beans, rice, and Pico de Gallo. ALL of it was perfect--and reasonably priced!!! Nacho Daddy can have my money any day. I'll be in the area for three more days and I'm seriously considering going back again before I go!!",

    "text": "Despite the name, the nachos didn't lure us to the place, the free house margarita with check in did that.  Note, this review is not biased because of that, however I should note that I went here twice within a few days and the free house margarita was honored both times.  The second time was with a group of 10, and we easily had $100 of strong and good margaritas on the house.  Our servers were Ryan and Judy (across two visits), and they were both extremely friendly, attentive, and had very poignant recommendations.  I followed Judy's recommendation to get the shrimp and steak fajitas and was extremely pleased.  A very good spread of toppings, a generous serving of meat and choice of flour or corn tortillas.  We ordered bottomless chips and salsa for the table, and there was never a dry bowl or empty basket for our 10 person party.  We never had to ask for more chips or salsa, it just kept coming.  As far as I know, everyone enjoyed their meal.  This place is legit.  Come for the free margarita, and stay for the excellent service and food.  I was also impressed by their selection of vegetarian and vegan options, even though I'm a carnivore to the bone.",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy I believe can be either a hit or miss and this last visit that I just had here which was the second one fell in between the two. I'd received a gift card of some sort to use up before next year and I had a good friend in town and after playing tourist we struck up an appetite. I thought to myself well why not try Nacho Daddy out again.   When we first arrived there was somebody who was standing at the front whom we thought was the server. I inquired with the young lady about taking a table outside and was told that she wasn't the hostess but yet a server.. You know just hanging out I guess. The hostess was off at the bar talking. Interesting.. Anyways while we waited for the hostess to be done I told my friend I would run to the restroom. Came out to only still find him just standing there. The thing I thought was most odd about this was that they weren't even busy so us not being able to be seated right away was throwing me off. Nonetheless we finally were escorted out to one of the table tops outside on the little patio. Weather was great so why not enjoy some great drinks and people watch?  Our server came out, introduced himself and even made some suggestions about some of the drinks. With the check-in on YELP they were offering a free \"house margarita\" which we ended up throwing in a few extra dollars to upgrade it to a more better tequila! Nice touch I have to give it to our server for having a great explanation and knowledge around the different tequilas!  Now with margaritas generally when you order them you are asked with salt, sugar or nothing on the rim. Being so indulged into conversation my friend and I didn't even notice this wasn't asked until we got these margaritas with all this salt haha. No biggie! Manager came around to check in on how everything was going and ended up fixing those again for us this time with no salt. Very much appreciated. Overall score for the drink was a 4/5.  On to the food! Yes! So I've been on this whole seafood kick lately so with that being said I went for the shrimp fajitas for two! Yes.. for 2! I had already made plans to order enough to eat there and then also bring some home. When ordering this for two I got some hesitation from our waiter and a face that all but kind of said \"are you sure\" listen if something says for two and that's what one person orders you have to be careful about having a prejudging tone/expression because it's a great thing I'm not overweight or else I would've felt some type of way like that wasn't necessary regardless if you are trying to make a point that it's a lot of food. Anyways.. The plate came out and sure it was a lot but were there even enough shrimp to warrant that $28.99 price? The jury is still out on that. How did they taste? GREAT! So that's all that matters right? 5/5 for those. My friend ordered the steak nachos and loved every bite.   Overall the visit was pretty decent. You may ask about why 3 stars out of the 5 huh? Well like any other restaurant rule, the food can be damn good but if the service is spotty that can make or break the whole experience. I think that in the start of the visit the area of opportunity could be to ensure you always have somebody at the front hostess station and even if they have to run to the bathroom or help another person whatever the case is, having somebody to fill in for that time frame can go a long way. Perception is reality so having the server who was there just chillin but not helping was off...",

We got checked into our hotels and decided to head out for some gambling and food. Nacho Daddy's excellent Yelp reviews did not steer us wrong!  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that the front desk really needed to get their act together. No one was at the hostess stand and things were clearly very disorganized. That being said, once we finally got seated our waitress was great.   The three of us split two nachos, the spicy shrimp and the steak nachos. Both were great, lots of flavor and plenty of food for sure! We added guacamole to the shrimp, but it came later, and honestly for the extra $2 it wasn't really worth it.  Free margarita with the Yelp check in, so that was nice! Apparently you can upgrade to a higher quality margarita and then just pay the difference, but I'm not picky and the house margarita was just fine, especially at the price :-).  So many great places to eat in Vegas, but if you're craving nachos at a reasonable price, this place should definitely make your list!",

At one point our waitress vanished and I couldn't get a water refill, but when she was on point, she was very on point. Side note- she was very cute and had a rocking hair cut. Anyway, randomly picked Nacho Daddy for a night out with my friends after we finished our conference responsibilities for the trip and we wanted nothing more than to get away from the conference center and down the strip for some food (and refreshments for my friends, which I passed on). The waitress gave great recommendations. Between the four of us we got the cheese enchiladas, the filet mignon nachos, lobster tacos, mini fish tacos, and the Mexican corn. I had the corn and the fish tacos.   The corn was tasty but not the best I've had -it was very, very light on the cojita cheese, and the seasoning was only on side of the corn, and barely had any crema. Elote is one of my favourite foods, so I was a tad disappointed. The fish tacos were tasty, I liked the mango salsa. My friends enjoyed their food and drinks as well. The servings were humongous, and the prices were reasonable- and it must have been happy hour because my tacos were discounted. I asked about the Yelp check in but it was after we ordered and apparently we didn't have the right kind of margarita, but definitely take them up on that, it's a great offer.   Would definitely try the nachos if I were to ever return, I just felt like getting something with more protein than cheese (full disclosure, I'm pescetarian- I did like the option of the vegan menu but wanted to try two smaller menu items instead. Would try them in the future if I were to return though!). The decor and vibe of the place was great and we were seated in a cozy booth with a good view of the open kitchen!",

Of course, because nacho is in the name, I had to get nachos right?! I ordered the BBQ chicken nachos based on recommendation from our waitress and they were fantastic. Everything tasted fresh and the portion was huge. I was starving from walking around the Vegas Strip in 100 degree heat, and I could barely finish it all.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was chill and laid back, they had a bunch of 90s-early 2000s music videos playing all around the restaurant which I thought was fun and nostalgic. Our waitress was also fantastic and was spot on with her recommendation of the BBQ chicken nachos. She was also prompt in refilling our drinks, which was a full time job as the we were thirsty from walking around all day.   Oh, and the margarita they give you for free was great! Definitely consider getting it to go as you walk around the Strip. I can't recommend this place enough. I will definitely return when I come back to the area.",

Their song selection was really good (at least while I was there).  They played everything from Kid Cudi to Linkin Park. The food itself is okay.  Nothing special and it isn't really authentic Mexican food.  It definitely is very Americanized but i think that's what they're going for.  It's closer to like a Baja Fresh if you have ever been to one.  Place is really cool and food is decent.  Wouldn't try again soely based on food but I might come back to try their drinks.",

Loved the fire presentation at the table upon arrival. The condiments were good too. Huge portion.   The nachos were a happy hour item and even though it was small, it was enough. It really did taste like a burger. Was delicious and a different twist to nachos.  But my FAVORITE favorite favorite was the sliders during happy hour. Oh my god whatever seasoning and cheese on it was just to die for !! Ill order it every single time I'm back. Was so so good.  Location was difficult to find . But once it's found--HEAVEN.

We were starving and this place definitely satisfied our cravings.   We ordered the triple dip. It was a ton of food and definitely worth the price tag. We didn't even make a dent in the app before our food was delivered. The queso, salsa, and guac were all equally delicious in their own ways.   There is a huge full-page vegan menu with lots and lots of options (including vegan cheeses, proteins, and more). I wanted to go all-out, so I opted for the burrito with vegan chik'n added to it as my protein. It was so, so, so much food and it came with a side of chips, salsa, and guac.   I ended up eating it all, something I regretted later that evening, but it just goes to show how delicious it all was. #worthit. The free margarita was also delicious. Not overwhelmingly tart or sweet; the perfect balance.  A few suggestions for the biz:  - the men's bathroom was disgusting when I went to wash my hands (remnants of someone partying too much that day) - since I didn't get a protein added to my burrito like chicken or steak, I asked for the vegan chik'n. They ended up charging me for that. I was a little ticked about that.  - it was busy, but not overwhelmingly busy and our service was spotty.",

While the location in downtown seems much livelier, the new location on the strip is great too.  The restaurant is a little hidden, located on the side of Planet Hollywood near the Miracle Mile shops, but outside.  Took us a little bit of navigating to find it.  Once inside though, you are immediately greeted with a warm welcome.  We arrived around 2pm, and the place was pretty packed.  We tried the \"nachos of the month\", Chimichuri Nachos, and OMG were they good, and with an ice cold Daddy's Margarita...YUMMY!  We also ordered the lobster tacos to share.  One word to describe the tacos...AMAZING! Definitely recommend Nacho Daddy for good drinks, food, and fun!",

There isn't much in the way of parking as it's on the strip, so having a cab or Uber drop you off is ideal.   We started with scorpion shots. They consisted of a small dead scorpion atop a slice of lime that was wedged on a tall shot of tequila. The proper way to enjoy this is dropping the scorpion into the tequila, squeezing the lime juice into the tequila, taking the shot into your mouth, chewing up the scorpion, and swallowing thereafter. Note: My compatriot tried to just swallow it and almost choked to death, so be a pro and chew your scorpions ;-).  On to the nachos! Hard to go wrong with filet mignon or lobster & crab nachos. I opted for the lobster & crab variety and was blown away. Easily the beat nachos I've ever had. Pro Tip: It's kinda spicy by itself with the generous amount of sriracha, so if you're not a spicy food fan, order it without. If you are a spicy food fan...well...add some of their house hot sauce. It's not crazy hot, but has excellent flavor.  You saved room for dessert right? Well I did and made the mistake of getting the churro Sunday. It was fine, but the real winner was the deep fried ice cream. That stuff was phenomenal. This place needs to expand to having a location or three in every city. You're coming to Kansas City soon, right?",

I really wanted to be able to eat it all but it's A LOT of food, so fair warning. Come hungry! I also tried the flight of Nacho Daddy's brews and I wasn't all that impressed with the house beers. Out of the Stout, Hefe, Pilsner, and Pale Ale... Pale Ale was the best. Super hoppy with big floral notes at the end. I'll be back in Vegas in October... and I will be back here!",

They were pretty big portions for nachos but the server said each entree are good to share among 2 people. My favorite was Thai Chicken! Each bite was filled with flavor and it wasn't like any other nachos.  Supreme tostada and Filet Mignon is pretty standard for nachos. Pretty good for a quick fix.   You can also get a shot with a scorpion inside for $20! We didn't try it but it seemed pretty cool.  Also, if you check in - you get a free house margarita! I believe it was lemonade + a shot of tequila. I got a good buzz from it!",

Salsa was great--I appreciated that it was ACTUALLY hot. So many times I order *hot* salsa and it's basically tomato sauce lol so thanks for that Nacho Daddy.  For my entree, I ordered the vegan chicken fajitas. It was one of the more expensive items but it came with A LOT of food. And it was delicious!!! I took the rest with me to go and although it was better fresh off the sizzling skillet, it was still good the next day. I never thought I'd have vegan chicken fajitas... And that they would be that good!  We finished with the vegan chocolate cake. MMMM sooo good. Very chocolatey and not too sweet or rich, just right. I normally don't even like cake (vegan or non vegan) but it was pretty great. We devoured it alarmingly fast...  This is a great spot on the strip if you're vegan and visiting with non vegans, since they have a non vegan menu. So everyone can enjoy! The restaurant had a fun ambiance and our server was great and attentive. If I'm ever in Vegas again I'm DEFINITELY hitting this place up again!",

    "text": "Really like this place for breakfast/brunch.  They have $20 bottomless mimosas (current at the time of writing, June '17) and our bartender had no problem adding bubbly when we thought the OJ ratio was a bit high.  Second piece of boozing advice is their Cadillac Margarita is MUCH better if you ask the bartender to make it with lime juice instead of sour mix; makes it taste much more like a proper margarita, but I know some people like the (sweet) sour mix that I think makes margaritas taste like lime sports drink, so get it normal if that's your thing.  The Grand Marnier floater makes it compete pretty closely with Margaritaville's $12 'perfect margarita' which has no mix, just booze and lime.  For food, I've had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde (green sauce, not red) and they were definitely above average as far as enchiladas go.  Obviously not authentic Mexican but reasonable for a touristy Vegas Strip restaurant.  The chicken quesadillas are huge; my wife ate half and was full.  I had one and it was also above average.  For the price, and location, I'm giving four stars because most Vegas Strip places are just mediocre food at high prices, and I left here feeling like I got a good meal and some decent drinks, at a price that matched.  A bit of side entertainment while we dined was watching some other folks at the bar order the tourist trap scorpion tequila shot, basically $20 for a shot of tequila that has an actual scorpion inside that you're supposed to eat.  The advice I heard the server giving them was chew it, don't try to swallow it.  They hadn't worked up the courage to down it by the time we left lol.",

It is on a side street off the strip so you do have to pay attention for it (right next to Buffalo Wild Wings). Our waitress was very sweet and down to earth, and we had fun just chatting with her. To start, we had the buffalo wings which were awesome. We shared he loaded nachos, which our server recommended as a shareable entree although if you were pretty hungry I'd recommend getting your own portion and not sharing. We had the fried ice cream to finish which was sooooo good I was actually dreaming about it when we got home. Definitely a fun, delicious restaurant and one of the few places in Vegas where I didn't feel ripped off... yippee!",

The nachos were really good - lots of toppings and fresh ingredients.

We walked in a party of 2 to a nearly completely empty restaurant and then had to wait 10 minutes for them to \"put a table together\" before we finally just decided to sit at the bar. Ordered the Supreme something or other and both of us  specifically said sour cream on the side, so of course when it comes out we have to send it back being it was covered in sour cream! They took care of it without issue but it just meant waiting a little longer for food. Service was OK at the bar as the bartender seemed attentive enough but there wasn't a lot for her to do as the place was empty. The bar itself had a musty smell like dirty water that kept wafting through as we tried to hang out and enjoy the ambiance.. But alas the stomachs started churning and we spent the most of the rest of the night sick and nauseated and ended up turning in early.. And side note the one beer we had there was all that was drank that night so it wasn't an illness due to any recreational activities.. Sad our first night in Vegas ended in duress but we will make more educated decisions in the future!",

Jordan ran our food and was super nice too, he helped us out anytime we needed anything. Our bartender Scarlett had our drinks flowing and was always there when we needed anything. Angie was one of the managers we talked to and she was really nice as well. We took one of the scorpion shots (something I neverrr thought I would do) it was weird but definitely an experience.

We got there late, and there was ample seating options throughout the restaurant. We chose to sit at the bar for faster drink service. The atmosphere definitely makes me feel like this place is on and poppin' during happy hour.   But I'm really missing the point here, the star of this place is the food. Any restaurant with an ENTIRE PAGE of vegetarian options that all sound so good I struggle to pick ONE - automatic five stars. I went with the chick'n chimichanga which was HANDS DOWN the best chimichanga I've ever had. It was crispy, but not greasy, and stuffed full of veggie and meat sub goodness. I STILL think about it when I'm back home disappointed with my lack of options any time I want Mexican food.   Our bartender was great. She was extremely attentive and was very courteous when clarifying the free drink voucher. I would definitely come back here if I return to Vegas.",

    "text": "If you had a few drinks the night before and need a good breakfast for another afternoon/night of drinking this is the place to be! First of all they serve you a french press of coffee, which means it's strong as hell and wakes you up! There are no free refills of the french press, but you are able to share it between two people with a cup and a half between the two of you. Trust me it's all you need. The breakfast menu is limited, but it covers the basics from breakfast burritos to breakfast sandwiches. When we got there the service was a little slow for anyone to come to us and that's only because the bartender was around the corner of the bar making two bloody mary masterpieces for two other guests at the bar. They looked delicious (if I liked tomato juice I would get one). They are probably the only restaurant that still does bottomless mimosa's!!!!   The food was tasty and surprisingly light for being so much of it. They use fresh ingredients so that makes all the difference. We can't wait to go here for Nachos and margaritas one night!",

Nachos were only $13 and it was enough to share.  Drinks: happy hour daily and top shelf for a margarita was only $11. Considering you are in Las Vegas, this is a deal.   If your looking for good food, good service and a meal that won't kill the wallet. Try this place. Will not be disappointed.",

Kirsten was our waitress and let me tell you that if you have her you are in for an amazing customer experience. She was incredibly sensitive to our vegan needs and had suggestions on the ready. We also had a coworker that is gluten free and had some other allergies and she checked on everything for her.   As for the food, it was really delicious and well presented. I had the crispy avocado street tacos for my entree. We all shared the vegan triple dip - their queso is UNREAL. And we finished with the vegan chocolate cake. Fresh and classic comfort food.  Well done! Thanks for giving so many options for vegan diners and taking such good care of us!",

It had been a couple years since my last trip and we had an evening free for a casual dinner. Off to yelp to find a place with vegetarian and GF options for our various dietary and allergy restrictions. So happy this result was so high on the list!   We walked in and they advised that they're computer systems were down, so they could not take credit cards. That was a bit frustrating, so we had to walk around the corner to CVS to withdraw cash. But just a few  minutes later, we were seated on the patio with a great waitress. She asked what salsa we wanted, and sensing out indecision, she offered to bring us all that they offer! We each had out favorite, so it worked out well.  I ordered the vegan chick'n quesadilla and my friend had some sort of tacos and we both LOVED our meals. The service was nice and they were apologetic about the delay with the checks. But I loved our meal and cannot wait until I'm back in Vegas!",

It's a huge space with really interesting decor and a variety of music videos on the TV playlist.   The vegan options on the menu were a pleasant surprise-- I got vegan nachos and the queso was almost as good as the real thing.   Unfortunately, despite the enjoyable drinks and an interesting and varied menu, the experience pretty much felt like a waste of 2.5 hours. The service was slow, the bar was so backed up that we were encouraged not to order second drinks, which was a first for me, and the crowded restaurant mixed with the high ceilings made it nearly impossible to have a conversation.   What could have been a relaxing lunch left me anxious to leave and disappointed to have chosen the wrong restaurant during a short weekend trip.",

I gave her a free pass as we were a table of 8, and I know it's not easy. I ordered the smothered filet mignon burrito, it was 17.50. I was super excited to eat it and as I worked my way through it there wasn't much steak in it. For a $5 up charge to have the steak there seemed to be only a few nibbles and tons of rice. I think the burrito would of been a 10/10 if there was more steak in it. I'm also not totally convinced it was filet mignon either. Seemed more of a skirt steak similar to what you'd use for carne asada. It was a stringing beef. Either way, I feel like the flavor was there but it was just lacking on the beef that I paid extra for. I'd be willing to try it again though. Maybe if I'm in the area I'll give it another go.",

    "text": "Oh Nacho Daddy, how I love thee...I've been to every (I think?) location in town and it goes like this. If your friends are just like whatever, I need food and I don't care- Downtown is a great option. If they are like ugh downtown ugh, we are staying on the strip- bring them here. There's a tank with live scorpions in the waiting area for Pete's sakes! It's a great breakfast option because  A) if you just flew in, you need fuel to get you through the day of bar hopping and living it up on the strip; B) if you flew in last night, you are probably nursing a hangover. Hearty breakfast nachos are where it's at!  It's also a great all other meal option for pretty much same reason.   I also think it's a great central location in a pretty cool setting at a very fair price.   They are located in Planet Hollywood, so you can still get shocking free parking at Miracle Mile shops and across from City Center, so you definitely have your mid strip glitz and glam.   Their entrance faces Harmon, should your Uber driver be confused about life.   Some faves- any Nacho Daddy Bowl, Spicy Shrimp Nachos and Loco Moco Nachos definitely hit the spot, especially if you are consuming your most important meal of the day. Margaritas. Love the margaritas. There are also some crazy good sliders, if that's your thing.  Oh and your morning coffee- French press. Ooh. Aah.",

    "text": "Me and my gf were soooo excited to go to the Bellagio buffet or the Caesar's palace buffet... but they were closed at 10pm (which is insane for Vegas- the palazzo pool is open til 10pm for God's sake).  We did a quick yelp and though we weren't in the mood for Mexican food, it was Cinco de mayo... so we picked here.   Holy. Cow. Just go. If you're considering it, just go. We had Edward and Rebecca serving us at the bar-they couldn't be friendly or more attentive. Edward recommended a new menu item- Nashville Nachos. Chicken, Mac n cheese, chipotle spicy mustard sauce, hot cherry peppers, pickles, cheese... and it was the size of a cookie sheet/piled high to feed an army. My gf got the Cali burrito- Filet mignon, garlic fries, homemade salsa and chips and it was soooo delicious and filling. Just a perfect experience/atmosphere/gem.   What started as a place to \"settle\" on and eat has instantly become a Vegas staple for future trips. It's affordable, quality, and we got two free, loaded, delicious frozen house margaritas by checking in with yelp and buying an entree. The review came after our meal and free drink (just had to check in to get it)... but had to write to share how much I loved this place. Enjoy!  Try these two menu items, you won't be disappointed!",

Also got a frozen margarita that actually had good flavor and wasn't weak at all .  Our particular waitress was very attentive .    Something unexpected - as my wife has a very restricted diet , they have TONS of vegan options .  An added bonus for us !  Surprisingly , there prices are really reasonable for a restaurant on hen strip .    Nice atmosphere too!  Highly recommend .",

Oh man can you taste the difference. A nacho plate will easily feed 2 people. That massive quantity coupled with the superb quality makes this a must do in Vegas.

I of course had to get the vegan loaded nachos because it is a Nacho place after all, and they were the BEST nachos I have ever eaten. Highly recommend visiting, especially if you're vegan! Can't wait to come again the next time I'm in Vegas!!",

The fish taco wasn't anything to write home about & I didn't finish it. The nachos, however, were really good and we ate every last bite. I got jalapenos on the side. The Fiesta nachos weren't spicy on their own so the fresh jalapenos really did a lot for me because I like a little heat. It's True there wasn't a dry chip. Moral of the story - Stick with the nachos if you go here. It's just their thing.",

One chicken and one pork. Highly recommend the chicken. Huge portions, lots of meat. Delicious  The nachos were loaded with meat and goodies, all the way to the bottom. Not like your typical nachos, where you only get the good stuff on top, and then dry chips the rest of the way. Not here. Come hungry.",

Their menu has something for everyone, including more than half a page dedicated to real, fulfilling and creative VEGAN options! The avocado tacos are heavenly.   Like their namesake suggests, they are taking your average plate of nachos over the top with unique interpretations of familiar flavors. My favorite nacho option is the Thai Chicken nacho- full of the classic Thai flavors but with a Tex Mex essence.   Their drink menu is also impressive, with high quality, amazingly fresh margaritas; you can watch them squeeze the limes fresh at the bar! We tried the house, blood orange, Daddy's, and spicy cucumber margaritas- all delicious! If you're feeling extra brave, you can attempt their signature scorpion shot!   This location may be in the center of The Strip, but has all of the welcoming atmosphere and service you'd expect from a local restaurant and the pride in their Vegas roots shows. From the managers, bartenders and servers, they spend so much time connecting with guests and expediently sharing top notch Mexican offerings with locals and tourists alike. Definitely a stand out option for a laid back lunch or dinner any day in Vegas.",

My husband ordered the Surf & Turf Taco Combo and I ordered the Baja Seafood Combo.  From the Spanish rice to the refried beans, everything was delicious.  I wanted to try my husband's food but he ate it all up before I could take a bite!  Even the free margarita with Yelp check-in was yummy!  Our waitress was super nice too! Left very satisfied!",

The Mexican corn side dish was delicious.  Others in our party had the chicken enchiladas and plain cheese nachos and said they were good.  The Mexican Candy margarita was very pretty to look at and was delicious- it is very sweet!! The ambiance in the restaurant left a little to be desired - it was pretty warm in the restaurant. Granted it was over 100 outside and the restaurant has very high ceilings, so I am sure it's hard to keep it cool, but we would have been more comfortable had the restaurant been cooler. Also, the music needed to be a little bit louder to create more of a fun atmosphere. We always gauge places by whether or not we would go back- I would go back but I will try something different next time!",

Found Nacho Daddy on Yelp reviews and was pleasantly happy with the great meals. Started with guacamole/chips, chicken wings, and the group had the usual array of tacos, enchiladas, breakfast and drinks. Service was really great. Food was fresh, nothing too spicy. One person sent her breakfast back because she asked for no jalapeno peppers on her omelet and it came loaded. Kitchen manager came by to check on our meals. A couple of the meals - were doused with brandy and lit up, which was fun for the kids. Ended with a couple of fried ice creams. Garage door windows were opened allowing fresh air and a few small birds to buzz around in the high ceiling restaurant.  Definitely a great choice for lunch.",

The group met there and put our names in their reservation texting system (which I always appreciate). We were notified via text that our table was almost ready and seated promptly after our arrival. We ordered the queso which was good but I don't think the tea light candle does much to keep it warm. I got the cali burrito which was AMAZING! I've eaten many burritos in my life and this was definitely one of the tastiest. My husband got the fish taco and enchilada which were also good. Portions were huge! Waiter was nice but he didn't fill out waters which wasn't great. We were way too full for dessert.",

The portions are big to share with a good chip to topping ratio. This place has fast seating and the service is pretty decent. I love to dine here when i am in town.

DO NOT ACCEPT a table upstairs. They have limited seating (I like privacy, but not like that) and heat rises, so it is a little warmer up there. Both of those I can deal with. But remember the stairs.  We sat up there for approximately 20-30 minutes, no server came up those stairs during that time.  There was one group of about 8 people at another table (they had drinks, but I am sure they got them at the bar before they went up).  The place had great reviews and it seemed to be a good atmosphere, but those stairs and the \"out of sight, out of mind\" mentality will leave you a little frustrated.   Again, I have no complaints about the food (since we never were able to try any) it's about being in a part of the restaurant that is not easily accessible by the waiting staff.",

I didn't change anything on my order: crisp lettuce, loads of toppings, cheese was yummy, and beef was perfectly seasoned. Bacon bits were a bit lacking, I only realized they were there on the bottom when I found one or two and had already eaten all my chips..  If I was gonna be nit-picky: 1) Would love to see red onion slightly less and bacon bits slightly more. Word to the wise: If you're on the fence about onion, maybe ask to hold... there's a lot.  2) As a solo diner, the contents of the plate were cold by the time I finished. That may be just me being a slow diner, if shared obviously not an issue. What if there was some sort of flame underneath like an asian style solo hotpot? Or a hotter steel plate? JK. It's probably not an issue for anyone else.  Everything else people ordered looked delicious. No wait, sat right at the bar. Food and drinks came quick. Service was friendly. Would highly recommend if you're in the area and looking for a good-value dinner, Very, very tasty.",

We stopped by around 8PM, and it was pretty busy, but we were able to find seats at the bar. We didn't order food, but I ordered a white peach margarita which was super delicious, and a pineapple mint margarita which sounded better than it tasted, lol. We also got a beer flight which was awesome. My fiance finally took his scorpion shot (so gross, but cool), then we headed out. The bartenders were very personable and made us laugh, which was refreshing after having some not so pleasant bartender encounters the entire day! Only suggestion would be to have some more upbeat music, they were playing some sad songs which didn't seem like it fit the environment.",

Also if your going to get margaritas makes sure you order them individually instead of the pitcher it is a way better deal because they fill the pitcher to the brim with ice not leaving much room at all for drinks.  But the margaritas are so good, we had the daddy's margarita and loved it!!!",

You can get better nachos at any decent taco shop. The cheese was like the stuff you get at the fair, running and out of a can.  Beer selection was limited as well, they only had one IPA on tap and it was from one of the big brewers.  They should always have local flavor.  Any ways...

I was really lost and because I checked Yelp I got a free margarita. I'm a server and would never normally do so, but it was 106 degrees outside and I found this out trying to get my ass there lol. I'm a bartender as well and this was a well made Margarita. I would have drank anything at this point, but it's like a $11 drink. Good service.   For the management though...Those trays are CRAZY heavy. I had I think the rancheros or chilaquilles and after it cooled I picked up both pieces separately. Both weighed about 5lbs each.   I work at a tourist trap with huge serving trays that destroy my shoulders. I can't even imagine carrying those safely and I've been doing this for 10plus years.   Don't kill your servers like that. Love San Francisco s Fisherman Wharf. Not the same, but each piece was insanely heavy. Take care of your staff. Your food is great",

They came out speedy and were enough for two!   Loaded with cheese, white queso, cherry tomatoes, cotija cheese, onions, jalapenos, marinated steak and the delish chimichurri sauce.  Wait staff was super friendly.   Even though there was some unusual Vegas rain, the huge umbrella was enough to cover my table and food outside on their sidewalk patio.  Located on the south end outside of the miracle mile shops.   Great menu that covers anything you could want!  Love the random videos they have playing in multiple screens.  Beautiful concrete bar.",

I got the fiesta nachos and my husband got the cali burrito. He gets the Cali burrito every place he goes, and this one was the best one. They put garlic fries instead of regular, and it changed the whole dynamic. If you get the nachos, I would share with someone. It's honestly a mountain of nachos and i had to take more than half back as leftovers.  The only thing that made the experience less than perfect was hearing a waiter go \"can someone take this to table **\" and another waiter responded with \"that's not my table, i don't give a f***\". So i would just be careful what is said when tables are right next to the kitchen. Other than that, i would suggest this place to anyone an a heartbeat.",

That was pretty convenient and kept our drinks nice and cold. Our waitress was also friendly and the service was good.  Free margarita with Yelp check-in! It was almost too sweet for my liking.. but hey, it was free and you cant beat that.  To start, my boyfriend and I shared the ceviche. It was a mixture of shrimp, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, cilantro, chilies, and avocado. It had the perfect amount of citrus and tasted really fresh! Just the right amount of spice too. I liked the larger chunks too, some ceviches have the ingredients cut into really small pieces.  I wish we knew how large the nachos were before ordering them.. they were definitely way bigger than anticipated and too much for just two people. We shared the Fiesta Nachos which had chicken breast, salsa, sauteed onions, refried beans, different cheeses, pico de gallo, guacamole & sour cream. They were delicious! I wish we could have eaten more but I was stuffed (also didn't want to take the leftovers to-go, soggy nachos are no good).  I will definitely return with a bigger appetite!",

I love spicy but my friend doesn't, so I had the condiments on the side. The server was cool and warned me that it may be dry. It was ok bc they gave us a lot of the condiments on the side. It came with jalapenos, sriracha, spicy aoli, and mango salsa. I wish there was more of lobster and crab. Nachos were ok. Lots of melted cheese, but the chips were cold. I still tried to eat it all bc it's $23! I love spicy, so I took advantage of topping everything with the condiments.   My friends got seafood chimichangas and steak fajitas. Everyone's looked good and tasted good.   Tip: Check-In for free margarita! It's actually really good! You get a free bday cake for your bday! Try the scorpion shots! When we went, they were out!",

Food is delicious and comes out pretty quickly. They have an extensive vegan menu ranging from their famous nachos to burritos and tacos salads. They use Daiya cheese and Gardien products.   The queso dip is not bad, they are the only place in Vegas serving a vegan queso dip so I can't complain.  However it could use a bit for nacho seasoning, or spice. Like if the chilis and jalapenos were blended into the cheese.   The vegan chicken tacos are my favorite by far followed by the vegan nachos.  The vegan fajitas are pretty flavorful and the taco salad is pretty large.  Can't wait to try some of the other items!",

No other place on earth comes close to the quality of nacho's Nacho Daddy delivers.   Ordered the BBQ Chicken Nachos, how is the sauce and cheese that superior to anything else I have eaten in my life? My god nearly ordered a plate to go if I hadn't shoveled a plate for two all by myself. My partner order the fajitas, holy cow, best fajitas on earth. Hot, spicy, juicy, flavorful, and had an aroma that entices senses for days.   Wish we had a Nacho Daddy in Orange County, it would put every single Mexican food chain to shame and truthfully out of business. I would recommend shorten the menu extremely, deliver on those items, and then go national. That way the quality cannot deteriorate. Right now Orange County restaurant Mexican food is dominated by the likes of Don Jose and El Torito, both cannot and will never come close to delivering the quality I had at Nacho Daddy. I feel I should sue both Mexican chains for serving such garbage after eating here.   Make an easy choice, come here for great food, excellent service, and Mexican food that blows away the competition by miles.",

The Margaritas are okay... My only problem was the fan!!! It was really cold and despite my numerous request to turn the fan off, it NEVER happened. End result.. cold fries but they were good for the short period they were still hot. Also...  did a Yelp check-in and got a FREE house margarita!!! Whooo hoooo... can't say NO to that!!!",

They were tasty but due to the wetness of the sloppy Joe meat the chips get soft. We had the supreme nachos the first time and I'd think I'd stick with them again. The guac was creamy and tasty and fresh. The naked grilled wings are really tasty. They don't need the buffalo sauce that comes with them. They are good just the way they come to the table. Be sure to check in on Yelp and get your free margarita. Free and tasty makes it a bonus!",

On my second visit I wanted to try their breakfast.  I am vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian omelet.  I was very specific with what I wanted and told my waitress, egg whites and no cheese.  Just like on my first visit I got my order with cheese.  This waitress did not say I'm sorry or anything and no smiles either. On my first visit my waitress was very apologetic and even took it out of our bill.  ...On my third visit I brought 2 other friends. Again I ordered breakfast, vegetarian omelet and was also specific, egg whites no cheese.   I again was given cheese on my eggs.  ...So here's my final follow up review, overall the food is great. It is on the greasy side but great food and great atmosphere.  Orders with specific changes however seem to get lost.  I wanted to give you 3 stars but because my first visit was so exceptional that I gave you the extra star.",

    "text": "Never have I ever stepped into a restaurant and felt so alive. Las Vegas has that affect on people, simply just walking the strip is electrifying and come 2:00AM, we realize that our stomachs weren't having as good of a time as we were - they were hollering at us, saying, \"we need food, dude!\" So, as we took the corner, we noticed there was a Buffalo Wild Wings and a Nacho Daddy. Of course, we've eaten at BWW before but never heard of Nacho Daddy and so we decided to take the dive and try it. We're happy we did.  The second we walked in, we were greeted by a gentleman by the name of Jacob. Jacob was our server and aside from wielding what was the world's greatest mustache, he also had an incredible personality, was welcoming and not for a second did we feel unappreciated. We took advantage of the free house margarita by checking into Yelp and it honestly was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. I've had a lot in my days on Earth and honestly can say Nacho Daddy takes the cake for the best tequila ever. Aside from the margaritas, the nachos were bomb. It was as if God himself cooked our meal for us. Not a dry chip on the plate as advertised. I had the Crab & Lobster nachos which I treated myself to with my winnings from the Bellagio (thank you Mr. Bellagio) and it was incredible. We also tried a chicken sandwich and some other nachos which were also really, really, really, really (x250 really) good. Service, atmosphere, food, it was all a 6 star experience. Yep, you read it here first... 6 stars, not 5. Pricing? It was reasonable considering we were on The Strip so there are no complaints there either!  All in all, it was incredible and it's ashamed we are leaving this afternoon because we would have been back tonight for some more margaritas and nachos. And this is for you Jacob, if you ever read this, you keep on doing what you're doing. You earned every cent of that tip we left for you and there is no doubt in the world you deserve a raise. Never lose your stripes, kid.  Cheers.",

When it was our turn to be seated, we returned but I hadn't finished my drink and they wouldn't allow me to take it to my table. Awesome thing was that they were able to save it for me. Now, for the highlight, I got a margarita here since there was some language in the menu saying that it was the best margarita. I have had many and definitely agree with that statement. It's the best one I've EVER had. I still have dreams about trying it again one day. It had the perfect balance of mix and tequila. So perfect in every way!

    "text": "You know what?! Nacho Daddy could very well be my daddy... for one night in Vegas (wink wink). But in all seriousness, this place is absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS! Mm mm! Scrum-diddly-umptious! Nom nom nom.   When in Vegas, you must get your eat and drank on amongst other things. Welp, I got my nacho on too. These nachos are LOADED to the max! You better come hungry! One plate of nachos is easily enough to feed 2 and maybe even 3 people. Nacho Daddy is located just steps away from the Strip and poses as the perfect tummy stuffer and alcohol complement (or hangover remedy if you need it).   After perusing the strip, I found myself getting hangry. It was late and Nacho Daddy was still open for business. Their bright entry sign will ensure that their building isn't missed. Ended up sitting at the bar and got distracted by their bright TV screens. They play a mix of old music videos ranging from the 80's to the early 2000's. The interior is very open and the bar setup is easy on the eyes. Litzs attended to me that night and while she was very sweet, it seemed like she and the other bartender were preoccupied doing other things. It didn't seem that busy but maybe something else was going on behind the scenes.   Speaking of this, my food took a really long time to come out. Litzs noticed that it was taking a while to come out too and told me that she'd check with the kitchen, but she never let me know of the status. When it finally did arrive, it looked fantastic! I ordered the supreme tostada nachos and boy were they a dream. First of all, how about that GUAC though? Just give me ALL of that green goodness puh-lease. They truly hooked a sista UP with all of that guac. These nachos were stacked incredibly high with the goods. There was no shortage of ground beef, cheese, guac, pico, or sour cream. It was honestly perfect. I don't eat nachos very often, but this ranks up there as some of the best that I've had.   I kept eating until my belly couldn't stretch anymore. And, what a shame because it looked like I had barely touched my plate when in fact I had probably devoured a pound of nachos. Just SO much effing food! Let's not forget about those delicious DRANKS too! One of the best check-in offers that you'll find; a FREE house margarita with the purchase of an entree (gasp)!!! Oh em gee! Their margs are straight FIYAAAH boo thang! The sweetness is just right and they make 'em strooong.   Litzs really knows how to work her magic at the bar for sure. I also indulged in a blood orange margarita which tasted even more delicious than their classic house marg. They've got so many different margarita flavors to choose from. It honestly doesn't matter WHAT flavor you get... just make sure that you get at least one... or two... or five! Okay maybe not five, but you catch my drift. Or... you CAN get five! Bahahaha! JUST try one. You won't be disappointed.  I really enjoyed Nacho Daddy and I'd totes come back for those delicious nachos and margs any day. If you're hittin' the strip and are looking for some yummy comfort food and tasty drinks, you need to try Nacho Daddy.",

    "text": "While I really enjoyed the play on words, I felt like my experience was a mini playground. The overall experience was fun but really awkward.   My group came here for lunch time and were hoping to get a place to get seated. Instead, we found out the line was long and the estimated wait would be close to 25 minutes. As a result, we opted to just order to-go since we were planning on attending an event later and wanted to get ready for that. The hostess told us the food would take about 25 minutes which we thought would be perfectly acceptable.   I specifically ordered their Poke Nachos while various members of our group ordered other items. During this time, of one the hostess was kind enough to get water for us. After waiting for about 35 min our orders started to come out. In this time frame, I asked if it was possible to get more water but another hostess told me I needed to go to their bar, which was super busy, to get water. I just politely declined but thought it was kind of lame to be quite honest.  Anyways, that wasn't what caused this low of a review. The main crux of this rating wasn't their food which isn't that good to begin with but their lack of communication. After my group's orders arrived around 35 min, my order was the last one remaining. After another 10 minutes pass I ask the hostess if they could check and found out that the Poke Nachos don't exist anymore. At that point, I wasn't even sure if being frustrated was the right emotion. I think I just found it hilarious. If it wasn't for the fact this same hostess who got us water also fought for us to get a replacement order expedited and a free margarita I would highly never recommend this place.   That said, I was able to get a replacement order made within the next 20 min and their daddy(?) margarita as compensation. I wasn't charged more so that worked out but if you're coming here just beware it's a little disorganized.  If you're talking about food, I would also just be cautious. I personally found the food to be quite bland. The most interesting thing about my replacement dish, surf and turf tacos were that the tacos were made of a flakey pancake similar to scallion pancakes. The tacos weren't that impressive, too much filling with vegetables and the meat wasn't well seasoned (needed more salt). Additionally, my friends also complained that their dishes were a bit bland.   TL;DR service was mediocre and they forgot a menu item didn't exist after 45 mins. Food is okay at best with it lacking in seasoning.",

Glad it was free it just wasn't worth almost $8 but again its \"on the strip\" so everything is $$. We ordered chicken nachos-not a huge fan of shredded chicken but again I was starving so we inhaled them. ($18) We also got some more chips & queso dip $8) came with a small tea light to try to keep the cheese dip from getting cold & congealed. Good looking out! It was a cool,Unique bar setting w tables and a long square bar. Chill place to meet up on the strip before going out on the town. Overall it was a decent appetizer night for us.",

So accommodating and had an amazing attitude! We got mimosas, margaritas and vegan chickn chimichangas! And I can not explain how delicious this was other than we both finished the entire thing! And it's not a small entree! The vegan sour cream was delectable! The food was so good we actually planned on coming back to try their brunch with bottomless mimosas before we even left our dinner! Due to some late night activities in Vegas, we ended up missing out on brunch but we couldn't get Nacho Daddy off our minds! We came back a second time and got the same thing!! So delicious!! Thank you again to Manny for the wonderful service as well! He was amazing and made this experience even better than we could have hoped for!",

    "text": "Although it may have taken me a while to finally come here, you better believe I've had my eye on Nacho Daddy for quite some time.  I mean, how could anyone not be intrigued?  Between their name, how there's nothing else like them on The Strip, and all of the delicious looking photos of their nachos on Yelp, it was really just a matter of time before I'd make my way here.  That and the proper group of friends (and playoff games to watch) to crush some nachos with!  Since they aren't technically on The Strip (they're around the corner from Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile on East Harmon), Nacho Daddy can be easy to miss if you aren't looking for it or see their signage.  While cut from the same cloth as Nachoria in the Bay Area (pretty cool to see that they've expanded to Vegas!), the menu here actually has more to offer both in the way of nachos and overall size - over a dozen varieties of nachos, along with an array of apps, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, tacos, soups, and salads, as well as a solid selection of beers and cocktails.  -- FILET MIGNON NACHOS - Grilled Filet Mignon, Refried Beans, Cheddar & Jack Cheese, Ranchero Sauce, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, Guacamole, and (no) Cilantro on Housemade Corn Chips...$19.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nacho-daddy-las-vegas-7?select=AbYly0ctaXorMCt-V49nvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nach...</a>) Quite simply, when I think of a plate of nachos, it usually looks something like this (except bigger...).  The filet mignon was flavorful and meaty, the chips were crispy, and the ranchero sauce was great, complemented well by the pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole  -- BBQ PORK NACHOS - Tender Pulled Pork, Housemade BBQ Sauce, White Queso Topped with Fried Onion Strings, and (no) Cilantro on Housemade Corn Chips...$13.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nacho-daddy-las-vegas-7?select=DzCqeL2Q1QXhbo9lcH2W7w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nach...</a>) This may not have looked as impressive by comparison, but this tasted almost just as good.  Not only was there a fair amount of pork, but I loved the addition of the onion strings.  There could've been a bit more cheese (soe of the outer chips were naked), but this was pretty good otherwise.  -- BONELESS WINGS - Pound of Crispy, Buttermilk Marinated Boneless Chicken Breast, Tossed with BBQ Sauce and served with Ranch Dressing...$11.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nacho-daddy-las-vegas-7?select=XeN3hugCyFyEqgn23dWWpg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nach...</a>) In hindsight, we probably should've just got their regular wings, but these weren't bad by any means.  While the batter was a little thick, all of the pieces were big, meaty and, most importantly, weren't drowning in BBQ sauce, which had a nice smokiness to it.  As good as the food was, I was even more impressed with the service here.  The hosts and wait staff were great, but our server, Sarah, was fantastic - she came by often, she was very responsive, and she was super friendly.  What's more, despite how we tied up one of her table for a few hours as we killed time before heading to the airport, she never gave us the stink eye or tried to kick us out (we made sure to get her back on the tip).  Considering how solid both the food and service was, I can't say I really have much to complain about.  That being said, I do have one major regret though - I wish I had remembered to check-in on Yelp before we left.  Sucks to know that I could have got myself a free house margarita if I had.  Fail on my part, but all the more reason to go back!",

Great job. If you want to stop in for a quick tequila mop for you stomach, this place will serve you well.",

I tried the vegan enchiladas and I honestly could've had seconds. It was SO DELICIOUS    We ate at the bar and Mariah was such a great server. Very friendly and attentive but not overly attentive. She gave us some nice spots in Fremont to visit. Peter, the manager, wanted to know how the vegan enchiladas were and I assured him they were phenomenal!   My friend had chicken fajitas and she loved them. She said the chicken was extremely tender and so flavorful.   AND they are reasonably priced. A must eat at restaurant when you visit Vegas.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is so relaxing, and the staff is friendly.  The menu has so many different options, so if you're not wanting nachos, you're in luck! They have tacos, burritos, enchiladas, you name it. I decided to go with the 3 enchiladas. It came with ground beef, chicken, and pork so it was nice to try a taste of each!  The rice and beans that came with the enchiladas was so tasty. That rice had amazing flavor, it was so good! We ended up getting our margarita to go since we were so full, plus it was a nice refreshing drink to have in the Vegas heat. Give this place a try!",

I believe he said his name was DJ. Super fun with great energy and very attentive. They have a humongous TV that plays music videos, which made the experience even better.   The food was great. A little pricey for nachos, but 1. It's Vegas & 2. The portion size was very large - it fed my boyfriend and I and we took the left overs in a box to go. A worker asked US if we would like an extra side of fresh guacamole and didn't charge for it. I thought that was pretty awesome. Over all amazing experience, great service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning next time were in Vegas!!",

My wife and i shared a plate and we felt there was enough for both of us.   The pitcher of house margarita was a bit weak and unremarkable (besides being overly sweet)... but in all fairness i did just say \"house margarita\" which is usually synonymous with weak and unremarkable in most places, so there that is.   Fun place, the staff was friendly and service was timely. The kids and adults all enjoyed the food, service and environment.",

They were all great, the fajita veggies were soooo well seasoned I was so surprised, the shrimps and chicken were alright. The chimichanga was my least favorite of the three, it was pretty heavy with too much carbs and the pork was not super seasoned - it was too much of a mush. The Filet Mignon Nachos, however, was amazing!!! highly recommend it. The meat was well seasoned with crunch from nachos and creaminess from cheese and extra toppings from the tomatoes and guacamole. I did not like the beans in it though, but that's my fault for forgetting to ask for it off.  Overall Taste 4/5 Service 4/5 great service, our waiter and host were so nice and fast Parking 3/5 hotel parking Price 4/5 typical Vegas price",

The hostess finally came down and I made sure she didn't seat us with any of them. Our resultant server, Ryan, was a sweetie pie!  We've been sitting for about 25 minutes drinking water. Our appetizers have yet to come out despite the fact that it's barely half full. I ordered the Sloppy Joe nachos and my daughter ordered the fiesta nachos. They were awesome!  I asked for a few red onions...so not disappointed! My daughter also loved hers.   Today is Taco Tuesday...we got two pork and one beef. Thank God they are only $5....they were horrendous (blech). HUGE benefit? Check in on Yelp for a free margarita!   So the manager just came by and offered to comp part of our meal and give my daughter a free dessert for her birthday! We got the apple pie nachos! OMG!! Soooo delicious. The nachos are soft and flavorful. Sweet and savory. The apples are fried to perfection and the whipped cream Is fresh so yum!",

It was loaded with shredded chicken - and I mean loaded!!  We substituted hot salsa for the medium and it was very good - had a good kick and nice flavoring.  All toppings were generous.    A definite return to spot and we will for sure ask for a table on Matt's section!",

We were the ones closest to the entrance by the server station. Family of three. Yep, that was us. At one point, our server was preoccupied with trying to create a cocktail for the table next to us, I guess. Before that, I have no idea why she didn't come by occasionally. After we finished our meal we waited for approx 15 min to just pay. I had to contact another server who was nice enough to cash us out.  Sorry for the review, but we had a bad experience today. I'm retired and very patient, but I do have a liking to a somewhat timely pace. Please look at your customers tables and be able to judge their needs.",

After about 15 minutes, the server passed by and was surprised we hadn't gotten our food yet. He said he would check on it. I think he forgot to put the order in. After about 5 minutes, I noticed nachos and a burrito sitting under the heating lamp. It sat there for another 15 minutes and our server was missing. It seemed like he was really hard-working so I don't blame him for being assigned too many tables. But by the time we got our food, all the chips in the nachos were completely soggy so we had to pick out the chips and eat it with a fork. It was also about 75% chicken, which meat lovers might like, but I didn't because after a few bites all that was left was shredded chicken and soggy chips.   As the server gave us our check, he apologized and seemed genuine. But I don't think I'll be back based on the food.",

    "text": "I love nacho daddy !! We always made sure to go to downtown Vegas to get our fix, but now it's on the strip !   Hands down the best nacho place I've had. I've had the supreme tostado and hot buffalo nachos which I extremely enjoy!!   If you like margaritas ! You got to try their margaritas !   Thanks to our waitress, Heather, for her great hospitality .   **Update: One star for this experience. The classic nachos still 5 stars though.   This is about my 10th time going to Nachodaddy whether downtown Vegas and now this. I was reached out to by an area supervisor and was told to contact the manager the next time I came in for my review!  I told Ryan our server at the time who seemed chill and cool when we first met her. I mean it didn't know what that meant when I got the email to ask for a manager next time I came in but I did it. Once I told Ryan our server about it she told me the area supervisor got fired and I felt like she didn't want to reach out to a manager... so nothing happened. Also, I feel like she wasn't extremely great after she took our order. She never really came around not even glanced at our table. I mean we'd get what we needed but it lacked the hospitality Vegas is known for. And then when I went into the restroom I realized why she never seemed to be around ... she was on the phone in a stall. I get it life happens we have other priorities but one she wasn't really there and then bam caught the culprit.",

French press coffee, excellent breakfast choices - everything tasted great.  And a fraction of the crazy strip breakfast prices!  We will definitely be back for breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, snacks, and NACHOS.  Love the \"buenos nachos\" t-shirts!",

The vegan nachos was my favorite on the menu. The nachos were soy-based, which worked out for my nut-allergies, and I was told that the dish was also gluten free. I saw another server bring out an order of the same, and couldn't believe that the giant sized plate was the same our table had received. Apparently, I had scarfed down the entire thing, and still wanted more.  Our server Dezi was so nice. She made us feel welcomed and was quick to take care of our needs.",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy is not that good. I went there and from my experience I did not feel like their chips were made in house. Not that that is important but I don't know if I was going to be marketing nachos I would try to make my own chips and I do not like it when I order nachos ma pile on some chips and then they pour everything on top because then none of the chips get anything on the bottom. I guess it's really bothered me because I don't know anybody that likes it like that and you're calling yourself nacho Daddy's you should know that people like the chips and all the toppings to be intermingled. The ambience is okay not that great and the customer service was okay nothing special kind of pricey",

    "text": "I've wanted to eat here for awhile and was glad to see a location right down the street from where we were staying in Las Vegas.  My husband and I wanted dinner so around 7:30 pm we went down and put our name in.  It took about 30 minutes to get seated which we expected.  Anyway, finally got seated and they have a pretty big menu so it took awhile to decide.  I ordered a Cadillac Margarita to start.  It came out very quickly and it was pretty good.  However, I didn't realize that it came rimmed with sugar instead of salt.  No big deal but I typically like salt on the rim and assumed that how it came.   Husband ordered fajitas and I ordered the Supreme Nacho.  You get a lot of food at this place so it's a pretty good deal.  Husband and I were not able to finish our dinner because there was so much food.   The cool thing about the fajitas is that they will light them on fire when they bring them to you.   The service is pretty on point and quick at this location which was appreciated.",

Very tasty, but really like an open face pulled pork sandwich with chips instead of bread. Not much cheese on there, which is what I think of when I think nachos. Still really good and filling.  Nice rustic western ambiance with an open feel. Service was very good. Hostess and waitress were helpful in navigating the menu.  House beers were mediocre, but they do have Dog Fish on tap.  We would go here again.",

We tried the world famous nachos and they were excellent.  I have to say, I have had better, but they were good and there was plenty.  My wife and I got two different kinds of margaritas and while they were a little different, we didn't have a preference.  Both were very good.  We had an awesome dessert.  A chocolate chip cookie or brownie or something with ice cream.... similar to others you get but it was excellent nonetheless.  One thing we were both impressed by ... our waitress was absolutely awesome.  I forget her name or I would toot her horn, but she was friendly, talked to us like she was interested in us and wasn't in a hurry to go to the next table.  She was the reason we would go back and she was fabulous.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Pricey, but everything on the strip is, so you can't complain about that.  Don't go to Vegas if you don't want to pay big prices for food and drink.",

Basically, we were greeted oddly at the door then finally decided to seat ourselves at the bar top area. Our bartender was very nice and got us our drinks, took our nacho order and proceeded to talk to her colleagues. 30 minutes later we realized we still had not received our nachos. Our bartender continued to dance and talk to her colleagues while we just stared at each other wondering if we should say something. They were not crazy busy, so finally the bar back decided to ask if we needed anything because no one else had checked on us. The look on our servers face made it clear that she probably forgot to put our order in and went straight to the kitchen. An hour later our nachos are finally ready and we decided that we are so over it and just ask for it to go. Nachos were just okay :/ wish it was worth the wait.",

House made spinach chips topped with mounds of queso, crema sauce, spicy salsa, shrimp and cilantro. The chips were a delicious twist, it was our first time trying spinach chips! We added extra hot sauce but the spicy shrimp had a kick.  The waitstaff and manager, Peter, are wonderful. Excellent customer service. Looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu!",

And called the police on him and had him removed from the restaurant. The second incident was that My family and I were eating outside  and down the street a couple got into a fight with someone else not involving the restaurant and we were trying to find the officers that were JUST THERE for another incident involving someone inside of the restaurant. Once that couple came down to were we were sitting they started cussing my little cousin out that's UNDERAGE, while one of NACHO DADDY's WORKERS were sitting out at the hostess booth. So we approached them telling them they need to apologize to her and they started to fight us and JEFF TOLD US THAT WE STARTED THE FIGHT AND THAT WE NEEDED TO GET OUT. While NACHO DADDY's Worker was telling him that it was the people on the outside instead of us. He kicked us out with out letting us get our stuff.",

This place was AWESOME and we had a great time coming here. After spending all day at Marquee Dayclub seeing Galantis (amazing live btw, trust me), we were looking for a new spot to try that we hadn't been to yet. My fiancee and I come to Vegas at least once a year, and so we've got many trips under our belt and believe it or not, feel like we've tried nearly everything out there.   I've always felt that The Strip lacked a really, really solid Mexican restaurant. Sure, there's Diablo's Cantina, but... meh. It's just okay. When we found this place on Yelp, of course I was down to give it a try. Mexican food is DELICIOUS, amiright? And a free margarita with a Yelp check-in? We'll now you're just being nice.  We headed over there for an early dinner around 5PM. The spot wasn't packed but there were people in there, and it definitely started to fill up with a fun crowd by the time we left. I still technically call this place \"on the strip,\" but you will have to walk about 40 seconds down a side street to get to it so if you don't immediately see it, it's just around the corner.   I ordered a chicken and carne asada taco plate and my fiancee got a salad. Both were absolutely FANTASTIC. We also got this delicious drip trio which came with chips (duh), guac, salsa (AMAZING!), and the most out-of-this-world bomb-dot-com queso dip that was just the best ever. If you're anything like me, you know that what can seriously make or break a Mexican spot is their chips and salsa -- for me, even if the food is meh, and the chips and salsa are amazing, it's a win in my book. Happy to say, this place nails it on all regards.  As I mentioned, food is amazing quality. Carne, Chicken, and my fiancee's salad were all on point, and the drinks were delicious, refreshing and strong (as they should be).  If you've made it this far in the review, I'm not sure why you're still reading and haven't already started heading over there... unless you have at which point I'll commend you for being such a damn good multitasker. Anyways, you won't regret your trip here. The vibe and customer service are fantastic and it's a great place to grab some food before you paint Sin City red.",

The server was snappy and made us feel guilty about asking for what we needed. We waited forever for her to come back after our food was delivered to ask for knives (we were only given forks and had to stir our coffees with them). When she finally came she threw the knives on the table... three knives for five people. The service really put a damper on what would have otherwise been a decent meal.",

The food is nachos brought to a whole other level but that's not what makes this place unique the staff is very friendly and the new General Manager Peter truly has the guests best interest in mind. Nacho Daddy is a new company but you can tell will be around for a very long time. Best in Vegas margaritas and they hold the title high and definitely earned it. The atmosphere is defiantly a party/bar atmosphere where you can have a great time with friends and take advantage of the awesome cocktails. If your visiting and looking for a memorable experience get a scorpion shot, you defiantly won't regret it!!!",

Cheese quesadillas with refried beans and Spanish rice, with the red sauce. The food was an explosion of flavor in every bite. The salsa was exceptional, not to hot not to mild exploding with flavor. The retired beans had a great texture and also exploded with flavor. The Spanish rice also had an exceptional flavor. I highly recommend this place and plan to revisit soon.",

Large screen tv and lots of other tvs playing good music videos. Nachos and drinks were perfect. The staff here are so welcoming as well! Manager Brian was very personable and our waiter Jovanny had us laughing and eating good! Will definitely return. It's just outside the Miracle Mile. Maybe I will be brave next time and get a scorpion shot!  Tip- try not to over fill up on salsa and chips before your nachos! But try the salsa for sure! There were 3 bowls, mild, medium, and hot!",

They never get old and I eat them at least once a week! They're the right amount of spicy, too. They're quite large and there also on the happy hour menu.   I recommend everyone getting the margarita you get for free when you check in. Their margaritas are so yummy and they're pretty potent .

    "text": "On paper this is a grand concept, especially to someone like myself that loves nachos so much. This one is in an odd location just off the strip, but is worth finding if you want some nachos while watching some sports. There is a lot of indoor seating and some outdoor as well. They have a lot of televisions through out.  We started with an order of the Queso Dip. It is a good sized portion and was a nice way to start the meal. In hind sight we likely did not need an appetizer but we were happy with it none the less. For the meal we ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nacho. I liked the idea of going a little off the grid for my selection. All the normal parts of a burger, less the bun, on a bed of chips. It was interesting, but tasty. I enjoyed it. The portion was massive. You can easily share them with multiple friends.  This is a good casual spot to load up on bar food and watch the game. It is pretty affordable too.",

We went on a Sunday night, so not exactly the food rush, but the service was excellent! Ryan was the best, we loved chatting with her and she was really attentive to us! The Thai nachos were sublime. Super weird if you're a nacho traditionalist, but if you appreciate a walk on the wild side then definitely go for it! The fajita salad was a standard Mexican style salad, and an excellent way to add vegetables. Three of us shared these two entrees and bottomless chips and salsa, we all walked away full and extremely happy we chose to stop in!   Also, the margarita is incredible.",

They took it back a second time and when they returned with it again, the food was cold. The food looks good but has no flavor.",

He said, he needed to have the table wiped down.  Shouldn't take more than a minute, right?  Wrong!  After waiting and watching , no one wipe down the table... including the host , who could have easily grabbed a rag and wipe it down quickly, we decided to sit near the hostess stand until it was done.  Next thing we know, we look up- and there is a party of 5 in the Booth!  We asked the host, \"what's up?\" And he shrugged and said \"sorry\".  At that moment I was so pissed, that we headed to the bar and sat down.  Thank goodness for Arnold, the bartender- he made an amazing margarita.  I was excited to try the nachos because they claim every chip would drip.. not so much but, they were still tasty.",

We frequent Las Vegas a few times throughout the year and we always eat at the same Vegan eateries and although those other places are good... NACHO DADDY is the absolute best!!!!! We came in for the first time with our car club family and have never heard of this place before, and since we were invited we kinda were just gonna settle with a salad or something because most places don't offer a vegan menu. Surprisingly this place hand one and we were super excited.  I ordered the Fajta Bowl and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas. We had some special request and the waitress SERRENA got our order right on the spot!!  Fast forward to today. We are going back home to San Francisco so we stopped in for breakfast since they opened at 8. And guess who our waistress was... We got our seats and our waitress SERRENA immediately remembered us from the other night AND she also remembered what we ordered AND the specifics (no cilantro, add jalapenos etc) i was immediately impressed and she is super sweet and friendly! The funniest part was when she caught my husband inspecting his vegan chicken and she came up to ask if everything was ok. We laughed because one he got caught and two because the reason he was inspecting it was because it taste just like real chicken and the flavor was amazing! Hands down the best service and vegan food in all of Las Vegas!! I hope the manager reads this and let's Serrena know that she's an awesome person and is a huge reason why we will return!!",

It was originally a \"filler\" lunch spot during a recent business trip to Vegas - we normally plan out our meals to maximize our culinary experiences but just wanted something quick and easy after we arrived in town.  The dining area had a small wait when we arrived so we chose to sit at the bar.  This was a great decision!  The bartenders are all extremely friendly and conversational.  We were also able to claim free house margaritas thanks to Yelp check in!  We chose the mini chimis (unsure of the official name but it was an appetizer) and filet nachos to share.  Both dishes were well-portioned and delicious. We will definitely make this our regular stop for quick eats or a casual drink when in town!",

Our server was one of the nicest locals we met; he constantly checked on us to make sure if we were still getting along alright. For the price you can't beat the amount of food they'll give you. You either need to A) Come VERY hungry or B) Be prepared to leave with a box. All in all, my only regret with Nacho Daddy was that I was unable to finish my mountain of delicious pulled-pork nachos.",

I have a challenge to eat at 24 new places in 2017. This was #11.   OVERALL RATING: 5 (SCORED 24 OUT OF 25) STAFF: 5 (All very friendly and enjoy working) FOOD: 5 SERVICE: 5 (Multiple people working on your table, not just one waiter/waitress) CLEANNESS: 5 PRICE: 4  Everyone has to love Nacho's...so what a better place to go to than a place called Nacho Daddy while in Las Vegas.   The address is Las Vegas Blvd, but it is on the front of a side street. Not far from the strip.   A lot of ingredients and mixers for drinks are all made in house! Which means better and fresh flavors.   Make sure to check in on Yelp while there and you get a FREE margarita. Not a cheap, piss pour one either. It was the same as the one we paid for! Had great flavor, mixed well too.   STAFF: Everyone was very friendly. The waiter spent time with us and the menu. Not once did they try to rush us and get us out of the place.   FOOD: Lots and Lots of it. Nachos can be split with a few people they are that big. However, since I was bowling nationals that day, I wasn't going to be eating much and ate it all to myself. Yes, I am a pig I know. Lots of flavor, not over whelming though. I had the crab and lobster nachos. I would def. order them again when I go back.   SERVICE: OUTSTANDING. Everyone was very attentive and helpful. Not once did we hear I am sorry you are not my table. Everyone asked if we needed anything else, etc.   CLEANNESS: Tables cleaned while you are sitting at them. Never a mess left at a table once people are gone. Food was picked up off the floor, which is a good thing because we know how messy nachos can be.   PRICE: You might look and think it is expensive...however, the size of the platter that the nachos come out on is HUGE and with lots of ingredients.   If you are in Vegas, this is a must mid day snack stop!",

We also took advantage of the free house margaritas when we check in on Yelp. Our server (who we unfortunately forgot the name of) was also very friendly and attentive. Overall, we had a great experience here and will be returning the next time we're in Vegas :)",

From the moment we walked in, to our server half heartedly greeting us, we thought this place was a big mistake.  Had to wait for a table to be cleared when there were plenty of empty tables. Confusing.  Our server threw straws at us when serving water.  Our food was delivered half-assed: we had to ask for the tortillas that accompanied fajitas and a plate for assembly.  WTF?  If you're planning on visiting, check out the FREE house margarita offer on Yelp to help dull the terrible service.  Remember: the food is great!!",

My husband and I were told  we could sit at bar without a wait, but no one ever came to bus the dirty dishes at our spot. So we got up and went back to the hostess stand to wait for a table. After 10 min, hostess said we could go sit at one of the 4 open tables in the bar. It took a while to get drinks, our server forgot my husband's food (and as long as it took for him to bring it to the table, it must've not even been put in and had to be made from the beginning), and 4 top behind us got their food long before us even though they sat down & ordered after us. The food was mediocre at best. I would not recommend it or want to go back.",

I remember the nachos having so type of garlic white sauce (NOT WHITE QUESO), which made the nacho taste really good and different. This time, I had it & it tasted really basic and flavorless. My husband order the filet mignon nacho. It had so many beans on them, he couldn't enjoy it. We were so disappointed!! We actually use to love this place.",

Excellent service and well made drinks by the super awesome waitress, Cerah.  At this visit my buddy and I ordered chips and salsa, wings, lobster and crab enchiladas, 4 cheese nachos, and filet mignon street tacos.    Chips are fresh, simple and bottomless.  The lobster and crab enchiladas are flavorful and surprisingly the rice that comes with the combo is delicious.  Four cheese nachos also simple and great for cheese lovers.  The street tacos are good; however, the meat itself is slightly dry.   Overall a great experience.  I recommend this and I don't do reviews often.  Definitely one of my go to places when I'm in Vegas.    Try the scorpion shot; I tried it my first visit and it was fun.  You can either swallow or chew the scorpion, really doesn't have much taste outside your tequila.  You get a souvenir shot glass when you try it.",

Again... barely any cheese.  We also go the wings, which the husband liked as well as the margaritas.  Our server/bartender Sierra was sweet though.  Would not come back.",

We purchased guacamole and endless chips for our table which went fast. ( definitely not enough guac or chips in my opinion ) but very delicious. The Dr Pepper we ordered was watered down but they immediately changed the syrup in the soda machine for us so we didn't have to wait long. Overall the food came out fast except my tortillas were a kinda dry and brittle for my  fajitas to be rolled up in but delicious non the less. I would definitely come here again!",

They allowed up to flow up our stroller up front right under the camera and reminded to us to take our valuables out. They brought up a booster seat but we both decided a high chair was better.. they seated us at the end which was a great choice for our crazy toddler. Lots to choose from , great portion sizes .. 2 people could share 1 plate of nachos because they pile it high. Our waitress was super laid back she was so awesome in making sure we had everything we needed .. even the food runner accommodated us by getting us an extra side of chicken from the kitchen at it wasn't even his table. Great experience will definitely come back here Our waitress even ran down the block to catch us on the strip to give back my sons sippy cup.  I totally don't remember her name but girl you rock!!",

Other items we ordered were ok, not great - chicken enchilldas and pork tamales.  Margaritas were good, it was interesting to see the people taking scorpio shots!

I actually waited there for about 5 minutes before i decided to walk throughout the restaurant to find someone to help me. Once i found someone, they told me they would be right with me. They took my food to the front where i waited another 5 minutes before someone came to close out the check. If that wasnt frustrating enough, got back to my room with the food and it was cold. And I'm sure that didnt help the taste because i ordered the baja combo and it was just disgusting. Seafood enchilada smelled bad and i had one bite and threw it away. The worst mexican food I've had. So disappointing. Never again.",

The ambiance is nice--it's rather dark inside but not overly so, and the tank of scorpions at the entrance was definitely eye-catching. The menu is pretty large, as are the actual nacho dishes themselves. I am not sure if they are all the same size, but we went with the Supreme Tostada Nachos and they were definitely enough for two people. Even though there wasn't a lot of food per se, there were enough calories in all the cheese and saucy goodness to last for a long while. All in all the dish was balanced and done very well, with the chips remaining crispy while we ate and flavorful salsa and ground meat distributed all around. They did screw up on the Daddy's Wings though; while the meat was perfectly done, the sauce on the outside was way too salty and made the wings pretty hard to eat. Maybe just a fluke? Remember to check in for that margarita.",

I understand why the worker's attitude is subpar, as the manager's attitude isn't reflective of someone who cares about the customer; she expressed no sympathy for the fact that we were leaving or the actions of her employee.

    "text": "Conveniently located on the strip, right by planet  Hollywood, Nacho Daddy is a really good late night food place.   We got a table for 2 immediately when we got there around 11pm. The waiters all seemed super friendly.   They have lots of options on their menu for all sorts of dietary requirements, including vegetarian/vegan/gluten free. They're also very flexible and can customize the items to your liking. Just keep in mind that the nacho portions are pretty huge! We got the nacho supreme and got the meat on the side.   The drinks are pretty great too - I had to get a refill of my Daddy's Mule! Highly recommended for a late night snack/meal!",

We didn't have to wait that long, but it was on a Wednesday at around 1pm so we may have already missed the lunch crowd. Anyway, our food came quickly and truth be told, I was expecting it to be just okay. I got the steak fajita bowl and my boyfriend got the chilequiles. We both loved our plates! We still had a little bit for leftovers, but unfortunately we couldn't take anything back since we are tourists.  A good place to stop! BTW, they have vegan options for anyone who is vegan/vegetarian.",

Came in, were the only couple at reception area, was told it would take 5 minutes to clear our table. Two more couples walk in, a different hostess comes up and seats them ahead of us. The original hostess returns and apologizes for the other hostess, says she's an airhead.   Not great. Will not return.",

I got the filet mignon tacos and they were juicy and delicious. We actually went back to Nacho Daddy a second time on this trip, because It was so good. However, they have birds in their restaurant which we weren't sure was intentional or not, but they could do without the birds. Other than that, we loved It!",

Walking in and seeing a giant scorpion in a terrarium?! Unreal. Plenty of TV's showcasing sport games? Yes please.   The menu had a ton of \"non nacho\" options for all the haters, but I narrowed my focus to the nacho options. I had to try the filet mignon nachos, which sounded so perfect. I had zero regrets doing so. The nachos were super flavorful, and the beef on there was amazing. Our party all ordered different nachos with the intent to share, but we all horded our own as soon as we got them. Beware of this.   They also have a scorpion shot drink, with a real scorpion in it! We don't drink, but asked if we could have a scorpion anyways to try. It didn't taste great, but added to the experience! Our server was super nice, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of during our visit.   Overall, be sure to check it out. Don't settle for a mediocre Vegas buffet when you can tour Vegas for cool places like Nacho Daddy.",

Now on to my fajita steak and cheese sandwich,the steak and onions were all cooked to perfection and the melted cheese was a great touch. The meal comes with fries and for a dollar more you can have garlic fries which I opted out of due to not wanting to deal with my own garlic breath.  My fiance ordered the open chicken tamale that comes with refried beans and rice which I had a bite of and to my surprise taste like a typical chicken tamale nothing special just not my cup of tea.  Overall the place was well kept with thee exception of the baby bird flying around. Our waiter was a bit slow but very polite.  And if you can please try the house Margarita it was the best Margarita I've had in a while.",

When we came to Vegas we were looking for highly reviewed places to visit and this was on the list. When we walked in the atmosphere was nice, but they were packed. I get it, it's Vegas. The one thing that kinda grossed me out was there was several birds flying around inside. Aside from all that we were eventually seated about 30 minutes after arriving. I was so excited to try the Bloody Mary and some carne Asada nachos. The Bloody Mary came and it was so bland. For Vegas my expectations are high on any type of drink and I was majorly disappointed. Then the food arrived. The nachos were soggy. It came quickly so I know it wasn't sitting out long. It could be too much moisture in that specific dish but there are few things worse while eating out than a soggy chip. Overall it was fine. The waitress was nice and the service was prompt but there are plenty of other places in Vegas that I would rather go.",

    "text": "Honestly, the best nachos I've ever had. My husband and I came for lunch while we were killing time yesterday waiting to head to the airport for our flight. We decided that a place called \"Nacho Daddy\" was too good to pass up.   It's a little strangely located, on the outside of the Miracle Mile shops, around the corner from the main drag. You can only get to it from the outside, not from inside the mall. We didn't have a problem finding it, but the location did surprise us.   We were promptly seated. I was quite frankly a little shocked to see that the windows and doors were propped open despite it being 100 degrees outside, but the air inside was kept refreshing and cool. Unlike a lot of places in Vegas, I wasn't shivering from the blasting AC, and I wasn't sweating through my clothes from stale air. It was literally perfect.  As for the food, it was AWESOME. We ordered two things of nachos, the BBQ Chicken and the Nacho Hamburger Nachos. True to their slogan, there was not a single dry nacho. The flavors were really unique and enjoyable, but both my husband and I preferred the flavor of the Nacho Hamburger Nachos. Two plates of nachos was a lot of food for the two of us. We were able to finish it, but were feeling pretty full and a little bloated for several hours afterwards.  I also ordered the tortilla soup which was really delicious, and I added a side of avocado to it which was perfectly ripe and a great addition.   We also had a lot of fun watching the music videos that were playing from the 2000s on the televisions around the restaurant! That's a fun idea.",

Ceviche was ok for a Mexican one, but the nachos really made me sad. Ordered a filet mignon Nacho and couldn't eat so spice it was (not stated on the menu) and I really like spice food so I knew it was TOO much. So much tomato paste (in nachos?? Really? ) that I wasn't able to taste the food itself. I only had the meat and the guacamole which was all I could eat and taste properly. If you want nachos I'd suggest you ordering something else.. it sounds delicious but at least mine wasn't.. I complained about it and they didn't charge me the nachos (fair enough since I barely touched it) and got me free dessert which was THE BEST CHURRO ICE CREAM EVER! Really, so so good!! You have to try it! Super fresh and yummy, it's not too sweet as I thought it'd be.  Overall, we had a good service and was happy i didn't have to pay for the food I didn't eat but I had higher expectations for a place that is specialized in nachos..",

The nachos that had come out twice and that were sitting while the ground beef was being put on the aide were barely not cold on top and just barely warm inside.

Once I was able to embrace the positives rigid tortilla chip, I began to pile the toppings on: Spicy shrimp, ground beef, quac, chicken tenders, quesadilla, more chips, didn't matter, the base chip could hold it all. I was then able to enjoy the flavors presented on the chip and thoroughly enjoyed my second chance try at Nacho Daddy.",

The spicy salsa tastes much like plain tomato salsa with some jalapeno peppers on top to make it spicy. The queso dip wasn't bad but the guacamole tasted like smashed avocados with nothing else added. I thought the steak on the nachos would have a grilled flavor and there would be a little more of it. Your staff however was very pleasant and the service was good. I don't mean to be harsh but those are my honest thoughts.",

The bartender walked pass us twice with no acknowledgement.  I wish I would have taken a picture of them huddled at the end of the bar but I didnt even think about it.  If anyone from management sees this,, please check your cameras from January 21st 11:20pm-11:35pm. I had on a camo hat and red flannel shirt, my wife had on a white jacket. Unbelievable lack of service.",

I sat at the bar and all of the girls were amazing great job to Alex and Sierra for recommending the beer flight and pineapple mint margarita. Because I was headed to watch the knights game I figured I had to have the golden knights nachos, tender filet drenched in cheese sauce with peppers and mushrooms was delicious!!! There truly was not a dry chip on the plate as they like to say at Nacho Daddy. During my visit i was checked on by both managers on duty who are always extremely friendly and polite. Kudos to Edward and Joe for striving and pushing the customer service , it really showed from the moment I came through the door until I left. I'm attending game 7 if it goes that far? so I'll be returning! Maybe I'll finally take that scorpion shot!!! GO KNIGHTS!",

Our waitress forgot to ring in some food for us, waited fifteen minutes for chips and salsa and finally then brought out our main entrees with no chips and salsa so we decided to cancel it. Heard the table behind is complaining about something similar, they ordered salads and then nachos but got nachos and no salad. Maybe the waitress was having a rough day but I'm a server and it's not that hard to ring in appetizers first or tell the kitchen/food runners you want them first. So over all just decent! This place did come recommended to us so maybe our experience was just a fluke thing. But I don't think This place is anything special. Oh and I forgot to mention the horrible rap music they were playing. I like some rap and I don't knock tunes till I hear it but this stuff was awful.",

We all ordered different dishes and they were all delicious!!! Vegan fully loaded nachos with real cheese and real sour cream for myself the vegetarian, burger with garlic cotija cheese fries for my boyfriend,carne asada nachos shared by my brother and his girlfriend , chicken sandwich  with side salad for mom and also shared half chicken sandwich with my brother and mexcobb salad for my dad, all delicious and we ended with the deep fried ice cream which was the perfect dessert shared by all of us just to satisfy our sweet tooth... most definitely will be visiting this place again.

I appreciated the choice of on the rocks or frozen, as that's not always a choice for a freebie. I got the frozen, and it was a delicious balance of salty and sweet.  We weren't too hungry, so we ordered the seafood enchiladas and boneless bbq wings to share.  The enchiladas were delicious! The refried beans and rice were also wonderful...not dry or tasteless as they are in so many Mexican places. I especially loved the pico de gallo...a blend of jalapenos, onions, and cherry (!) tomatoes.  The wings are good, not great. The breading is very crunchy, the sauce flavorful. The chicken itself was a little dry, but not inedible.  Overall, I very much enjoyed our experience here! If we were going to be in Vegas longer, I'd definitely return.",

The place was already packed when we got there. We were greeted by the hostess and got seated right away. Our orders came out faster that I expected which is awesome. And it didn't disappoint! The tacos I ordered taste so savory and my daughter's California Burrito was the best Burrito she had according to her. They even customized my mojito. Since I don't really drink alcohol, they made me a Raspberry Mockjito (non-alcoholic). I love the vibe in that place, there's flat screen TVs in every area and a huge projector by the kitchen area playing top pop hits. The servers are also nice and friendly. We are definitely coming back to this place.",

Shredded chicken and we chose the hot salsa. They will customize your nachos. Corn was fantastic. Margaritas were very good. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. It's a big bar so service can take slightly longer if there is only one bartender but really can't complain.  All I can say is go there you will not be disappointed.",

I can't recall the names of the nachos that were ordered, all I can tell you is that the portions are huge and they did not skimp on the Guacamole and Sour Cream. The wait is not that bad, yet is recommended that you make reservation. Parking is relatively okay, but let's face this location is on the strip and you know you have to walk a little more to get there unless you Ride-share.  I really liked the atmosphere and ambience that Nacho Daddy created. I feel it's a great meet up for friends who visit from out of town due to its location and even to gather with your coworkers after work.",

I had a similar experience in China once, but that is a different story for a different time. I decided to pass on this one.  Overall a fun place which I would definately take friends to next time I'm in Vegas.",

Easily walk to Nacho Daddy from the shopping mall.   This place is very, very, good and lives up to its name, \"Nacho Daddy\" The amount of choices is crazy endless. The portions of the food is crazy HUGE! Go here with a big appetite. Wash down the food with the good beer which, for a strip restaurant, is not too bad. $5 during happy hour, and $8 during regular time (16oz)  I ordered a appetizer, Endless chips and salsa. The salsa comes in 3 heats, low, med, and hot. The chips are corn chips made fresh on site and are very good. If you have a big party this is the way to go. If it's just 2 of you don't order this. Instead order the chips and guacamole. The amount of chips they give you is enough for 2 people and you won't be able to go through \"endless\" before your Nachos arrive.   For my Nachos,  I tried one of their Exotic Nachos;  Lobster and Crab - Butter poached lobster and crab, white queso, Serrano aioli, Mango pico de gallo, fresh Jalapeno, and Sriracha on top of house made corn chips. $23.95  All the flavors were noticeable in this dish. The serrano aioli, the mango pico, everything. Most importantly, the lobster and crab were plentiful.  Every bite had ample amounts of lobster and crab. They do not go weak on this dish. When the Nachos were finished, I was still eating lobster and crab off the plate.   I am glad I am a Vegas local. Now I can come back and try all the other Nachos. One last thing, the service was very on point and prompt. I can't wait to come back.",

With my check in I got a free margarita and IT WAS SO GOOD!! I highly recommended any type of nachos or margaritas here! The fried avocado tacos were also BOMB! As for the whole scorpion thing, as an animal lover not really into a dead scorpion in a drink/shot or the live scorpion at the entrance in a cage but whatever floats your boat. STAFF IS SO NICE!!

Made reservations for Saturday night. Came here with 8ppl. The food is very fresh and everything is made daily. No joke every single person in our group enjoyed their meal. The nachos are by far the house specialty and they do it very well. Chips are bottomless all you can eat. The guacamole was fresh like it was just combined in the kitchen. If you can ask to sit in Ryan's section. He's the hardest working waiter in the joint. Free shot of any liqueur you like as long as it has a scorpion in it. This place has really great food and atmosphere. It's just off the strip so it's super easy to get to. No doubt Nacho Daddy will be a top stop every time we are in town. Oh yeah, full bar.",

We shared the kale salad and fish tacos- delicious!  Fresh! Creative! fast! The food was beautiful and tasted great.  One down side- I wanted to eat and talk, not feel like I'm at the club.  I know its Vegas, but if I wanted to go to the club, I'd go there.  Highly recommend.  We got carry out later in the week too, yum!",

The service was friendly and we received our food in a respectably short period of time. I'm sorry to say- I received the wrong meal- I ordered the vegan chimichanga but received the vegan kale salad instead. The waitress apologized and I ate the salad rather than reorder. It was really delicious- the vegan chicken was so tasty and it had avocado and various other veggies with an agave citrus vinaigrette. The 4 stars is because of the order error- because I was really looking forward to the cheezy chimi! I'm still in Vegas for one more night- so it's possible I'll stop in for a chimi  later",

Unfortunately, after spending $20 on one order of filet mignon nachos, we realized (like many places in the strip area) that this place was nothing more than another tourist trap. The filet was over cooked and tough (which is the opposite of why you buy a filet to begin with) and it was covered in an awful salsa. Had the salsa been left off, the nachos would have been better. We also ordered chicken tortilla soup. It was supposed to come with chicken breast, however the chicken was left off but our server quickly corrected the error.   Overall, the food was good, I just wouldn't recommend spending top dollar on the filet nachos, and I would ask for the salsa to be left on the side.",

So little help from the hostess or the bar. Nothing is marked vegetarian on the menu - tho they have an icon - and even their chips and salsa remain unmarked. So unless you're a carnivore or don't eat cheese I would avoid this place. Also service was awful. It took at least 15 mins before I could ask about vegetarian menu items... overall I'm just so disappointed...   Service: 1 star. Vegetarian friendly: less than one star.   That's all I can attest to because we left.",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy is our favorite, go-to place in Sin City! We stumbled upon the location in downtown last year and found that they opened this new location off the strip.       On this trip to Vegas, we've eaten here twice.   All of the menu is good, as a large group of us have tried multiple food choices!  Being from Texas and getting chips & salsa as an appetizer with your meal for free, is the norm. Here it is not. So we bought the chips & salsa appetizer. They make three different in-house sauces and two of the three we really enjoyed. The mild and the hot are excellent salsas, but the medium just didn't cut it for us. We enjoy the Naked Grilled wings in buffalo sauce. They are quality wings with lots of meat!  Let me also rave about the white queso dip! It's basic, but really good.  My wife loved it!            For this review, I only took pictures of the meal that we ate this time. This meal was the Hot Buffalo Chicken Nachos, which are chips covered in queso with popcorn chicken that has been tossed in their buffalo sauce. Then they drizzle a ranch dressing across the top, add some celery, some green onions and, wallah, you have spicy nachos! On our first meal, just 2 days prior to this review, I had the Nacho Average Burger Nachos, and they were delicious.  Others had the Filet Mignon Nachos. We all drank buy 1 get 1 free margaritas, and they were excellent.       The service is great.  The first visit we had Mark as our server.  He was very attentive and quick.  Great personality.  On this review visit, we had Victoria as our server.  She was great.  Very bubbly and sweet. Outgoing and willing to get what we needed. There is also a food Runner / assistant named Humberto.  Let me tell you, this guy was fantastic! I told the manager, Mikey, that Humberto was a great employee and Mikey appreciated hearing that about him.       I very rarely will give five stars, but Nacho Daddy on the strip in Vegas is well deserved. I even went as far as telling them they should bring this restaurant to the DFW area in Texas. If you're ever in Vegas, go check them out. I don't think you'll be disappointed!",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy was delish! My friends and I stopped by after arriving late in Vegas. On a Wednesday, there were limited late night options. I had researched this place before our trip, so I pretty much had an idea of what I wanted to eat. We all ordered different nacho dishes and margaritas and tasted each other's food. Hands down, the best thing we ate was the thai chicken nachos. They were a smaller portion than the other two plates we had (tostada nachos and barbecue chicken nachos), but they were extremely flavorful! I was very impressed by this dish. The margaritas were good, but (unfortunately) not too strong. They were also very sticky from being overfilled, resulting in the drink running down the side of the glass.  The Famous Scorpion Shot: I ordered it. I thought I could drink it, Scorpion included. That didn't happen. The Scorpion looked tiny in other photos and videos I had seen on previous reviews. I assure you, it is not! It's about an inch and a half long, served as a garnish on top of the lime. I asked the server how to eat it. He said he preferred chewing. That wasn't going to happen. Then, I thought about swallowing it whole. So I dropped it in the shot, thinking I could swallow the whole thing and not even flinch. WRONG! Once I put the Scorpion in the shot glass, it magnified the size. Now it looked like a yellow and brown monstrosity, and all I could think was, \"This thing has got to come out of me at some point.\" I chickened out and grabbed the nearest fork and fished that sucker outta there! I did, however, drink the entire shot of tequila without flinching. I should get some credit for that.  My friends mentioned we were there to celebrate my birthday, and the server didn't hesitate to offer me a free shot! That was pretty nice. I definitely didn't expect any freebies in Vegas, on the strip, during a holiday (Halloween) weekend. Overall, this restaurant and service was great! And we talked about those thai chicken nachos for the rest of our trip.",

    "text": "This is such a cool little spot. We sat at the bar and they had the garage style window open, which was really nice. I started with a white peach margarita and it was SO good! I had to restrain from chugging the whole thing right away. My husband got the blood orange margarita and it was good too (a little tart for my liking). I then tried another margarita that was one of their specials. I don't remember the exact name, but it was something sunrise related? It had fresh raspberries and agave. It was delicious! And these margaritas are enormous!   My husband and I shared the appetizer street tacos. We got the lobster and crab variety. They're served in doubled corn tortillas and with a delicious corn salsa. So yummy!   I ordered the supreme tostado nachos. Seasoned ground beef, shredded cheese, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapenos, lettuce, avocado lime salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Amazing! Honestly we probably could've shared these as well. It's a HUGE portion!   My husband got taco-enchilada combo with chicken on both. I personally would've ordered the mojo pork simply because I prefer pork, but I tried a piece of the chicken and it was very good! Super tender and juicy and very flavorful!   They lose a star because we waited a substantial amount of time for our food to come out. And our appetizer came at the same time as our entrees. We also received our food after the people next to us even though we ordered before them. Not the end of the world, but I'm talking 30 minutes we waited. Luckily we had our margaritas and fun atmosphere to keep us entertained   We will definitely be back in the future!",

I came back to Phoenix bragging that I ate a Centruroides scorpion and didn't get stung... my toxicology friends corrected me and pointed out the type I swallowed actually is not a Bark Scorpion and am not quite as cool as that (apparently the shape of the tail was the clue).  Our group took the shots together, and one of my friends made the mistake of chewing the little bugger... don't do that.  Margaritas were excellent, nachos were killer (one of the best bangs for your buck in Vegas - try the shrimp or the filet mignon nachos!), but honestly the service was even better.  Audre was our hostess and was absolutely amazing.  We actually came back a second night during our week-long stay to take more scorpion shots, mainly because of the friendly atmosphere.  It feels like a nice local bar in a small town, and it's able to avoid the flashiness that covers the rest of Vegas.  Keep it up Nacho Daddy!",

All meals were satisfying and definitely great portions. We will be back next time we are back in Vegas and hopefully the service is just as good and gets us just as hyped. The perfect warm up for the strip!",

Our food came out a little late, which we didn't even notice and Kristen provided us an update and let us know that they had discounted our meal because of the delay. Thank you for the wonderful food and great customer service.",

    "text": "I don't even know where to begin. First off, the 5 star option doesn't do this new restaurant justice.  I would do 10 if I could base it on the same scale. I was so impressed from the moment I walked in. Jaylon greeted us with enthusiasm and character. From that moment things were over the top exceptional. We sat down with an ambience that I could only imagine will be perfect for a Friday night. We came on a Saturday afternoon so it was quite relaxing. This is where we meet our server Mark. Mark was the BEST server I have ever had hands down. He was funny, lively, and went out of his way to make our experience here the BEST it could have been. He was prompt, precise and engaging. I had an issue with a coupon code for another nacho daddy and he corrected the issue with NO problem.   The food: oh my gosh. We first got the triple dipper which was frankly okay. I love queso so I was most excited for that, which is the reason for my okay status. But the triple dipper didn't even matter once we got our entrees. First of all we only wanted one basket of chips (even though we were offered a refill) and by the time we picked up the last chip our food was arriving. I would like to say thank you to Ruben for running the food, he was just as courteous as Mark and treated our table with respect. He and Mark were more than we could have asked for for exceptional service. So the main courses. I NEED to talk about the street tacos. This is a MUST. If you're a Tex mex connoisseur like me, you know NEVER to order chicken from a Tex mex place you've never been to ( for those who may not favor this type of food as much as me, you don't because it's typically dry). It was DRIPPING with juices and I was shocked! My friend ordered them because I was steering clear of anything chicken because of the previously stated reasoning. I regretted not getting them. They were so amazing and flavorful. Side note: EVERYTHING besides the guac was peak perfection for flavoring ( guac wasn't bad, you just had to add a little something like salt which I thought was thoughtful for people with salt sensitivities). I ordered for me and my friend to share the filet mignon nachos. They were so delicious and the perfect plate of nachos. I went ahead and added the queso from the triple dipper and there was no going back. We didn't have room for desert but it was so good without it.  Overall: I am so pleased that I chose this place and would recommend it to anyone, I even raved about the place to the couple that walked in as I was sitting at my table. My hope is that they can make their way out to LA soon so I can get the chance to experience this restaurant again!  Thank you to Mikey as well for leading a GREAT team!  - edit : the margaritas are from God himself but be careful because they taste like juice and they will creep on you!",

We brought in outside frozen drinks, which are a no no, but the hostess put them in their fridge for us while we ate, which was nicer than having to chug them.  My boyfriend and I are gluten free and dairy free, and we love Mexican food. We got the vegan queso, which was delicious. We also got the filet minion nachos, they were very tasty but did not have much meat. I got the free margarita with check in and our waitstaff recommended other vegan friendly area restaurants. We will definitely return in the future.",

Staff was SUPER friendly.   We had the Triple dip to start, it was a great appetizer with queso, guacamole and salsa. We also tried a couple different margarita flavors but personally I loved the mango.   As entrees I had the signature tacos with pork which were gigantic! It comes with two tacos absolutely stuffed with meat. The tortillas were really good and fluffy sort of like Cafe Rio's. My favorite part of the dish may have been the rice it was SO good.   I also tried the buffalo nachos. Definitely would be a good hungover or drunk food but I got pretty full at that point! The last thing we tried was the churro sundae which came with two churros and three scoops of ice cream. I feel like they could have reversed that with two scoops of ice cream and three or four churros. The ice cream seemed to melt before we could get to it.  Overall it was an awesome experience and I think people will have a really good time here. They also have scorpion shots which I witnessed but don't think I'll be participating in. Good times, great food and drinks!",

It was a large portion but Not a ton of steak considering they were $18. The salsa on the nachos tasted more like tomato sauce than salsa. Looked like the staff was still figuring everything out.

    "text": "I'll leave 3 stars because of 2 big reasons. 1 service at first was horrible the door guy checked me in ... I don't know if there was suppose to be a hostess there or not b/c after he sat us he went behind the bar to bartend. I waited ... And waited ... And waited, until about 12-15 min later the same guy walks over and asked if we have been helped.  He apologized and said he would tell his MgR, and so he did.  He took great care of us afterwards. Food was great and delicious.  Drinks (I got micheladas) were on point and really good too!  The waiter promised me he would take care of 1 drink and my appetizer.  I thanked him and told him he was great and maybe someone was having an off day that I understood.  The 2nd part comes in when I get the bill, he took care of my appetizer and 2$ extra but not my drink as promised.  I would have been ok if he told me he was going to take care of my appetizer only, but don't tell me your going to do something and not do it.  That's the worst !   Worst part about the experience is it was dead, so they had no excuse on the amount of time to attend someone.  Would I recommend it to someone ... I don't know if they have service like that maybe not, but the food is really good!  I think the Mgr should have been out on the floor helping if they were short handed, or whatever the case was.  I saw a few employees just standing in the back just staring right back at me ! WTF! That is another management problem.",

We waited an hour before we got our food (which was really good), but even people who came in after us got served before us. It was disappointing because it was dead in there, but our server SUCKED!!! Then we paid cash, and he didn't bring the change and said \"you don't want the change right?\" Excuse me? Weirdest guy ever. And we bought the over-priced scorpion shot, and no one made it a huge, cool deal like they made it out to be. The weird server brought it out and walked away. Weird. Good food, but I wouldn't go back unless I was drunk and could stand the wait.",

First- tables were dirty and not bussed. There seemed to be only one waitress and she seemed overwhelmed. The worst thing was when we asked for the Supreme Nachos and were told there was no beef?!!! I should back this review down to two stars, but the first two visits really were perfect. The four cheese nachos and the nacho supreme would bring us back when we return to Las Vegas.",

It was good but it would've been better if the sauce was actual enchilada sauce not salsa.  Overall a good experience.  Next time I'm trying the nachos.",

If I could make a recommendation, it would be to offer different sized portions of nachos with variable prices. For being a tourist location, it doesn't allow many the option to take \"leftovers\" back to their hotel room, or to sit in a car all night. I would've preferred a smaller portion versus wasting food and $$.",

If a place has to write their own reviews to boost up their star rating, they must not be doing something right.   So I came with a good amount of awareness that this meal may not go very well, but much to my surprise, I had a very pleasant breakfast. We had a mad hankering for some nachos and this place seemed to fit the bill.  Our server was prompt and willing to give us lots of recommendations. She did have a hard time explaining the switch over from the old beer list to whatever they had on tap now. Either way, the pale ale being offered was good.   The supreme tostada nachos were plentiful and came out all gooey. Quite the site to see.  The chilaquiles were so good! The tortilla chips were not soggy, even though it had the enchilada sauce tossed on it. The chicken on it was so good too!  Also, they have a great Yelp check-in deal! If so inclined, You can even pay the difference for better tequila in your margarita!  Honestly, this place was awesome! No need to post their own reviews, just keep dishing out those awesome nacho dishes!",

She was adding on ten minutes to every party that signed in, by the time we got to the front it was a 40 minute wait. We waited a little over 20 minutes before we were called, which was ok, but I'm sure they loose business by people going elsewhere bc of the inaccurate estimates. When we were seated, most of the tables were empty! We were almost immediately greeted by our server who took our drink orders... Thought that was a great sign of a good server... Boy was I wrong. The rest of the time we were sitting there, she was literally running past our table and completely ignored us every time we tried to stop her. It took about 20 minutes to finally track her down to take our order. A runner brought out our food, we needed to ask the busser for a knife and cilantro and another server for our bill. Our first waitress finally brought the bill, but then never came back. After ten minutes, I walked the check and our credit card to a manager at a computer and told him we just wanted to get out of here. Five minutes after that, our waitress came back go ask for our check. The food was good, we had the vegas knights nachos and the filet mignon was super soft but the service was incredibly terrible",

He avoided us most of the time ( probably cause we had children with us) had to be asked for a water refill when it sat empty for ten minutes. We waited almost fifteen minutes for our check and another ten for our change. As someone in the hospitality industry I expected better service from a grown man instead of him acting like a teenager. I understand that it was a Saturday night and things were starting to get a little busy (but there was no wait) but you need to step up and do your job a lot better.",

I told her it was sweeter than the first and her response was \"at least it was free\" and didn't offer to help me get a margarita that was correct.  Not the right response in my book, especially for a place giving a free margarita to check into yelp... which is a place for reviews.  Vegan food=good",

We sat at the bar and Our server, Arnold, was one of the best bartenders we've ever had! His cool and calm demeanor makes you feel like you've known him for years! We could tell he was super busy but that didn't stop him from being attentive and answering all of our questions about the menu! We will for sure visit again. Thanks Arnold for all of your help!",

Well it's 2017 and honey, This place is still popping at all hours of the night.  Music videos play on all the screens while you enjoy the numerous cocktails, nachos, tacos and many other Southwestern and Mexican fusion dishes.

My ultimate goal was to try to the seafood nachos but I decided to go with the carne asada tacos as I didn't want to seem like a complete hog. The tacos were amazing and very flavorful. The bartender was a complete sweetheart and made sure I was taken care of. I'm coming back to Vegas in April and ND will definitely be on my list.",

Overall, I was very happy with the choice to get nachos from here, the staff was very friendly :)  Would love to come back to try some of their exotic nacho dishes!",

I walked across the street to Nacho Daddy.  Immediately i had high hopes for something good.  The restaurant was very well decorated and calming and I sat at the bar and Andy introduced herself as my breakfast saviour.  It was early and the place was happily quiet, but it was very comfortable sitting at the bar.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and a greyhound.   I waited patiently for my food but sipped on my delicious drink.  The burrito arrived and it was definitely worth waiting for.  Everything was put together perfect . . . fresh eggs, crisp bacon, rich cheese, and crispy hashbrowns.    Top it off with the most delicious (very unexpected) and spicy salsa and jalapenos and i was in heaven.  Definitely what i needed and will now desire.  So, conversation with Andy kept going and it turned towards tequila.  She hooked me up two delicious shot and set my day up perfectly for gambling and more drinking.  Peter, the manager, and I had a great conversation too.  Next time i go to Las Vegas and I am looking for Mexican food, Nacho Daddy will be on the top of my list.    I hope that Andy and Peter will both be there!  Made for a great experience.",

Glad we finally got to come here after all this time.   Big bar and big kitchen! The wait time wasn't long at all, food came out fresh and under 10/15 mins.   MARK, our waiter, was awesome, super friendly and funny! Glad he helped us out.",

Which means so much for us plant based people who like to still eat real food and not sides. I get the vegan chick'n chimichanga. It's delicious! This place does get pretty busy around dinner time but they still seat you pretty quickly. Be sure to utilize the one free house margarita yelp coupon! The house margarita is kinda sour, like tarty. It's not the best but you get one for free. And if it's free, it's me! The location is very convenient. And I have no complaints about the service! Definitely try this place!",

We started by getting free house margarita's with our Yelp check-in, they were strong and delicious! The chips and salsa were great. The vegan chicken quesadilla was unbelievable.

If you checked in on Yelp, you can get a free margarita drink. We didn't know that it was a specific one and that we don't get to choose the flavor. We ended up ordering more from the menu but sadly cannot indulge since we were heading out to a show immediately after dinner. The complimentary one we tried was really good mix.  We ordered BBQ chicken nachos and deep fried lobster tacos. The BBQ chicken nachos was YUMMY! It had the tanginess from the BBQ sauce, the chicken meat was good amount, and the white cheese added creaminess to top it off. All of the flavors married well together.   Now- I wish I can say similar great review to the deep fried lobster taco. Sadly, I cannot. Although it came with mango salsa and a slice of avocado, it felt lacking. It needed a sauce or cream to lighten up and cut down the deep fried taste.   Our server was nice and apologetic about the confusion regarding the margarita. That didn't really bother us. I wish I could have gone one more time to try other nachos.  Why don't you head over to the Midwest?!! I'm sure you'll be welcome!",

After we put in our order and food  she did not ask to  see if we need anything else.  But our food and drinks came out fast. I get it if you may have a rush but after while it died down. Once we got our food the Bartender did not check up on us.   I felt I had to get her attention. I had to ask for our checks.   With that said I would just come out here for happy hour for the $5.00 happy hour.",

For the prices they charge - you would expect a mountain of nachos. NOPE. At $15-$20 for a plate of nachos - that are smaller portions than the $8 nachos at Dave & Busters and Buffalo Wild Wings - it was quite a disappointment. They have a lot of \"specialty\" nachos - which is great for the variety - but the prices are ridiculous. The waitress, when we asked about portion size, told us we could probably all three share 1 nacho order and be fine and full. We were so hopeful! We still ordered 3 plates of different nachos - no one left full - we all left hungry with no food left. Ridiculous. Go somewhere else for nachos. This was a waste of money.",

We had Dean as a server, and he was kind, \"with-it\" and a great server. Our meal...house margarita (comp'ed with Yelp check-in), vegan queso app, giant side of pico de gallo (yum), and smothered pork burrito. Meal was monstrous and delicious. Service time was great for a crowded dinner time. (Make a reservation, it's a pretty tiny spot.) The bar had lots of tv screenage for sports with one screen on the restaurant side.  I'll note I liked the way staff worked together well, maximizing service efficiency. Too often anymore, servers minimize service for the section they work in, and ignore the guests next to their section because there is no tip in store. Not the case at Nacho Daddy. Kudos to the mgr and service team! If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat here, often. Our experience was great!",

I ordered the spicy shrimp nachos covered with beans, fresh jalapenos, delicious homemade salsa (with cilantro), and sour cream, it was scrumptious. My boyfriend ordered the breaded fish tacos with beans and rice, the breading on the fish was to die for. Definitely a must try restaurant... Enjoy!",

It is slightly difficult to get to this place because it seems like it is in the Miracle Mile shops, but it is actually outside and to the side. We had a tiny bit of trouble finding it. But that could just be our poor navigation skills.   Once we found our way in we were seated pretty quickly. Although the table was still dirty. They wiped it down right away and apologized. Not a big deal.   Our server was Chase who I believe is also a bartender. (I remembered his name because i have a toddler who loves Paw Patrol). Chase was fantastic! I personally cannot do tequila as it makes me sick. So i asked him besides margaritas what could i have? He told me he could make the margaritas with rum instead. I was so happy with that. I ordered the White Peach Margarita (with rum). My Hubby got the Nacho Daddy Margarita. They were big and tasted great! They each had 3 oz of alcohol.   For food we ordered the Vegas Golden Nights Nachos (Nacho Daddy). OMG! Incredible. These nachos were everything. A perfect ratio of chips to toppings. Piled with marinated filet mignon, provolone, yellow queso, sauteed onions, mushrooms, bell peppers and pickled peppers.  We added jalapenos.   I would go back to Vegas just for these Nachos. It will be very difficult to find something similar in California. Keep up the good work Nacho Daddy. We will be back!",

Not a single place in town has nachos that even hold a candle to Nacho Daddy. My husband and I STILL talk about the meal we had at NachoDaddy and it was 10 months ago. We also recommended it to everyone we know who is going to Vegas.   The server was super knowledgeable of the menu, and took a minute to show us where to find the vegan menu and explained what could be made vegan upon request.   I had the Loaded Nachos and my husband had the Spicy Chick'n burrito. Both were amazing. I want to try every vegan option they have.",

I went and got the American Breakfast (because my stomach wasn't ready for Mexican food yet) and it was super yummy! Everyone at the table loved their food as well. Good portion sizes too! Our waiter made sure our drinks were always kept full and I ended up ordering some salsa & gwack before we left which turned out to be a great choice too!! The building was really neat inside as well. Just an overall wonderful experience! A must try!",

Once inside we were well accommodated as one of our party was on a mobility scooter. Ordered the Mexican street corn off-the-cob, Supreme Tostada Nachos, and the Chimichanga. The corn was absolutely outstanding! If I could have it flown to my home, from Vegas, I would! The chimi and the nachos were good as well. The nachos were a little too hot thanks to the jalapeno but we forgot to ask to remove them. Still enjoyed our meal though. The nachos was a very large plate as well. The decor had an old bookstore/antique look about it; very laid back and cool. Definitely a place we'll be back to. I'd say our only issue was the fact that the waiting area was very small and when it's 108, it's a little tough to have to wait outside. Otherwise, we enjoyed our visit.",

Not a fan as a vegan... the hostess and waiters were nice. But they sat us at a table that was all wet underneath and did not clean it. My feet were wet from having sandals.  We ordered the loaded vegan nachos that were pretty good. They weren't as big as other orders so we were a bit disappointed. Then we ordered the chimichanga and a salad. The vegan \"chicken\" was probably the worst we've had. It was burnt, and tasted like burnt dry chicken. Not even with a nIce flavor.  Meanwhile they have something called a scorpion shot which the table next to us were all having very loudly. Eating little scorpions.  Just because they have a vegan menu, they are not a good vegan friendly choice. With so many other amazing options in Vegas, I would go elsewhere. Especially with the prices.",

I'm a fan of scorpions but I never considered eating them. I have eaten grasshoppers and crickets but never scorpions. They have the scorpion shot for ~$20, depending on type of tequila you select. I ordered up one for me and the bartender. They are able to drink 2 a shift. Just chew the little creature first and then shoot the tequila. Don't worry the stinger is removed. Little chewy but nothing a True yelper couldn't handle.   Since it was Tuesday they had a great Tacos Tuesday deal. Tacos were dirt cheap and full of meat. They were probably some of the meatiest tacos ever. You could easily share an order or just eat the meat. The tacos don't come with too many extras, so they're a little plain. We also ordered the filet mignon nachos. Those things were bomb! Huge chunks of meat as well.   Service was excellent. Our bartender was very entertaining and knowledgeable about all the dishes and drinks. We also scored a house margarita courtesy of the yelp check in offer. I was a bit skeptical at first because the yelp page had a consumer alert warning for multiple positive reviews from same IP address but it was Tuesday and I wanted tacos.   I wouldn't bring the kiddos here. Cool spot to have date night or hang with some friends. Happy eating/drinking!",

We arrived with a party of six, there was no wait time. The service and food was great! Our food didn't take long. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice, of course I had my complementary Margarita. Which wasn't very strong.... but hey! It's free! So drink up! Bottom line everything was delish!

It took us a while to decide after going down their huge nacho list but with the help of our server we decided on the enchilada nachos with queso added on top.

The queso was delicious and the house margarita is wonderful. The house margarita doesn't taste strong but after two, when you get up, watch out.",

We drove up to Vegas this past weekend on a whim for a quick getaway, and after checking into our hotel, our first idea for food was Nacho Daddy!  They stay open until 2 am, so you have plenty of time to pop on by in the evening for some delicious nachos and the other food offerings that they provide.    The nachos themselves are AMAZING, and we love the white queso dip that it comes with - the jalapenos add a great kick to its rich, creamy flavor.  But it has more than just nachos, despite it being its namesake!  The street tacos I ordered here were some of the best I've ever had.  They were full of meat and toppings and very filling!!  The rice and beans were very satisfying as well, so it was an all around delicious meal.    We ordered it to go and ate in the room, but the atmosphere in the dining area is awesome as well, and we've eaten in there before.  It's like a more lively and fun Buffalo Wild Wings!  The prices are also quite reasonable for something on The Strip and for the quality and size of the portions!    I love Nacho Daddy!  I'll definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!!",

Inside has good music playing (hip hop)with several TV's playing sports and music videos . Table and bar / counter seating . Upstairs seating too. Appeared clean.   Hostess and waitress were friendly. A lot on the menu . A bit pricey since it's pretty much on the strip. A lot of hearty food on the menu . Breakfast served all day. Decent selection of specialty drinks .   Appetizer: spicy wings - OK, enough for two, a little burnt on outside , served with ranch and celery.   Meal : Cali Burrito - Good, filling , served with chips and salsa . Chips just mediocre , salsa is plain no authentic salsa flavor.",

Came here for lunch only to get their nachos to-go. We ordered 3 of their nachos to take back to our hotel for a party of 8.   * Ordered:  - Filet Mignon nachos (5/5 stars): As soon as we got our order & had to wait for our uber driver to pick us up.... we completely finished this entire box between 4 of us before uber even got to us! LOL! We had to order another box. The mixed fish, cheese, & salsa make this a good combo with chips.  - Seafood nachos (3/5 stars): This was our least favorite, but was still finished by the end of the day. I think the mango was too fresh that it didn't taste as well with the seafood & my cousin agreed.  - Fiesta nachos (4/5 stars): This was our 2nd favorite. Packed with meat, cheese, & colorful chips. Definitely looks like a fiesta in a box. There was a lot of meat in this one.  Missed out on the full sports bar & drinks but they do serve happy hour, gear, & games to participate to win in! All 3 boxes were good for a party of 8. Not a full entree, but good enough for a filling snack in between drinking throughout the day!",

Jovany took care of us from the moment we sat down to the seconds we walked out.   Location was great as well. Easy access from the Planet Hollywood miracle shops. Not too much foot traffic on the harmon side, so no worries about bumping into too many people turnt up. Haha.   Also want to mention that there are TVs every where! So if you wanna catch a game without all the Vegas intricacies, then this place is an easy option.",

We got the Daddy's Margarita which was a good size and not completely filled with ice like most places. You could actually taste the alcohol and it was only $12.   Food was absolutely delicious.  Chips and salsa were good, but salsa was a little too runny. Fiesta nachos were SO GOOD.  I also got pork street tacos (mini appetizer size) and there was so much meat packed in I had to take some out just to fold the taco and I could only eat 2 out of the 3.   If there are 2 of you, chips and salsa and an order of fiesta nachos would have been plenty to share.   On my way out I saw a terrarium and thought, oh interesting, but saw a bunch of crickets (eww) in there and wondered what was up with that. Later I read about the scorpion drinks and I'm glad I didn't know about it while I was eating in the restaurant. I don't need a tub full of insects lurking around in the restaurant that I'm eating at thank you very much!",

I am passionate about my nachos and Nacho Daddy did not disappoint! The nacho menu options were broad and included both traditional and more interesting toppings. I ordered the Supreme Taco Nachos, which our excellent server Ryan \"spiced up\" by adding hot salsa and extra jalapenos! The ratio of toppings to chips was good with the toppings distributed throughout the chips so there were very few plain chips. The toppings were not too wet which helped avoid \"chip sog\". Thumbs up to the nachos!  In addition to nachos, the Nacho Daddy menu offered lots of choices including delicious-looking appetizers, soups, salads, tacos, burros, enchiladas and more. The drink options, including a full bar, also added to the enjoyment.   We will definitely return...perhaps tonight!",

I am a local and came in for happy hour and obviously set at the bar. The bartender her name started with a C and she was Caucasian with dreads. She literally distributes the worst customer service known to man. We had to ask repeatedly for water, our alcohol drinks and sour cream. She didn't care; she was in her own rude world. I felt neglected as a customer; she made cynical comments like \"I work for tips\" etc. I complained to the host and asked for a manager but one never came over. Just avoid this location . Please note it wasn't busy and we received no silverware !",

On my second visit, it was crowded and the wait staff was busy. The service was even slower than the first time. The waitress never showed up to our table. Thankfully, another waiter saw the hungry look on our faces and realized that we had been waiting 20 minutes and had not even placed a drink order.

We got here a little after noon and was quickly seated inside. As the hour progressed, more and more people came. Yelp has a free margarita for a check-in so that was the first thing we were on the mission for. Jovanny was our waiter and he just exuded warmth and hospitality (I might be biased because he called me exotic looking ;) He brought us out our margaritas right after taking our orders. I'm not a huge fan of margaritas but this was good! Plus, it came in a cute mason jar which was nice.   Jovanny came by with some chips and salsa on the house (this guy is such a sweetheart!). Our food came by pretty quickly. I got the dry chicken wings with BBQ sauce and my fiance got the supreme tostada nachos with vegan chick'n. I LOVED my wings - they were crispy and I got to dip it in as much sauce as I wanted. My fiance devoured the nachos but the few bites I was able to get, it was so good! For people who like spicy, that is a great option!   Bottom line, this is a great place to grab a bite and a drink. Make sure to ask for Jovanny :)",

I had the chicken Tringa, shared with my wife and we struggled to finish the plate. We went nacho overdose.  Extremely tasty. Next time we are going to try the fajita nachos. The plate looked huge and the aroma made me hungry again, even though I could not eat anymore. Being your friends to help.",

I opened my box to FRESH jalapenos added on top of the nachos. I thought, fine, I'll just pick them off. Too bad I forgot about the little seeds that blended in with my chicken. Anyway, I noticed right away there were missing ingredients; no green sauce, no sour cream, no salsita, and hardly any beans. What a let down that I couldn't enjoy the nachos as described on the menu, but what I did receive was still tasty.   I attached photos to show my order, what they should look like, and the receipt. I took off one star for the person who took the order, and one star for whoever made them without any other toppings.",

The place was fairly busy, but the hostess knew of our party and promptly, without even asking, guided us to the stairs that led to our party. Point for knowing the situation.  Service was ok, just a bit slow at times but understandable since our party had about 18 people all putting in various orders at various times, and only one server, MJ. She did a great job handling all of us. Billing was perfect, no issues there.  I had the beer battered lobster tacos, that came with a side of rice and side of beans....standard fare. The tacos were tasty, loaded with salsa that almost overwhelmed the entire dish. I wish the lobster would have been a bit larger so it balanced out all the lettuce and salsa better.   I'll give them 3.5 stars. I'm not a huge fan of Nacho Daddy, based on a few meals at the old Henderson location.",

First we ordered the spicy shrimp nachos, and the bartender TOLD us they were spicy, and usually I can handle some spice, but damn, those were spicyyyy. Fiance loved them. So then I ordered the pulled pork nachos, white queso, BBQ sauce, pulled pork, crispy onions, yum! We also ordered an app of the queso. I'm not saying that I ate all of it...but I ate all of it. It's cheese sauce in a skillet in your face!   Bottom line: mimosas and nachos are actually a really good combo.",

So instead I just ordered a breakfast burrito to go one morning for second breakfast. The burrito was incredibly large and came with a side of chips and salsa which was a nice touch. But it took almost 20 minutes to prepare despite the restaurant being almost completely empty. And without the addition of the salsa from the side of chips and salsa, the burrito itself was a little bit bland. It is a nice large space, with plenty of TVs for watching sports, and nice bar area. I could see this as a casual snack or dinner location and they have very reasonable price points compared to many restaurants on the strip nearby.",

We got the trio with chips which came with salsa, guac, and queso which were all surprisingly good since guac is always a hit or miss. I got the shrimp tacos which were a make your own and came with a side of tortillas which was a perfect meal. Overall, for a yummy lunch or dinner right off of the strip, this place is reasonably priced and GOOD.  The atmosphere is also great - when we went they were playing 90s rock music and had the patio open. We set right on the edge of the restaurant and the patio and it was perfect.",

    "text": "Went here with a two of my coworkers during our work trip and thought to try this place out since everywhere was booked (It was valentines day).  We made reservations and when we got here, the place was pretty dead (that was a hint) and then we got seated in about five minutes.  We had requested a booth from the supervisor on site and he said we will be getting one but when the host seated us, she didnt give us a booth until we asked  again.  Their communication was not all that great.    Guest 1 - Spicy Cucumber Margarita, Lobster Tail Tacos (Drink made me sick) My first round of spicy cucumber margarita tasted like sweet juice.  i even ate the jalapenos and they tasted like green pepper......  The second round I tried it and it was almost like the first round's spicy japaleno was forgotten on the first drink, and doubled on the second.  It made my stomach hurt and i have never experienced that before in my many spicy margaritas.  Then my food came out and the presentation was very nice.  Things tasted great but I felt like the lobster tail was very minimal.  I was not impressed at all.  Definitely overpriced for it.    Guest 2 - White Peach Margarita, Chicken Fajitas (food made her sick) FIrst round of white peach margaritas tasted very well, but the second round was so sweet, my coworker could not drink it.  Her food presentation was very nice but she said after her first taco, her stomach started to hurt. She barely finished her food... was not full nor buzzed.    Guest 3 - Malibu bay breeze, shrimp fajitas First round of her drink was very good, in a tall glass cup. Her second was downsized to HALF the size.  Her food was not cooked right and we're not sure what made her stomach hurt but even the next morning after, she was not feeling it.    I will spare you the lack of service from our waitress who I felt like kept on kicking us out (it was very dead, and we were there for less than an hour)   IN SUMMARY - We ALL got different food and we ALL got sick.",

    "text": "Rare VEGAN oasis on the strip! Nacho Daddy is tucked away on Harmon just outside of the Miracle Mile shops with street/sidewalk access only (a little hard to find at first.) They have a separate vegan menu section and use Gardein chick'n product (optional) in their vegan quesadilla, fajitas, burrito and nachos. Kudos to Nacho Daddy for making their vegan cheese (cheddar style) in-house -- it was delicious. I had four meals here spanning my week in Vegas; thus, I tried several vegan meals, and all were delicious. I highly recommend the vegan burrito and vegan chick'n nachos (huge portion for $16.50). I like hot/spicy ... and be warned their hot salsa is definitely \"hot.\" On the downside, their is a large aquarium at the front entrance which houses large, disgusting black scorpions. Clue to Nacho Daddy: This is more disgusting than cute. Perhaps a health hazard and certainly and stomach-churning site for some. You're doing so many things right (include the large screen TVs) ... why be \"cute\" with the live scorpions? Just get rid of this weird and creepy addition.",

The servers seem like they are happy. You can tell a fake smile anywhere. The manager has been over to check on me every time that I've been in. Drinks are refilled, plates are cleared.

My group of five was pretty hungry so we each ordered our own nachos and shared family style. The waitress said one nacho order could feed 2 to 3 people but she didn't know how we do. We ordered the Filet Mignon nacho (BEST!), Buffalo Hot nacho (yummy for those buffalo wing lovers), Nacho Average Burger nacho (tastes like a cheeseburger), Carnitas nacho (SO YUMMY) and some other one that is not on the yelp menu. Obviously, the last one wasn't that memorable so that can be skipped.  They are open 24 hours on the weekend so definitely give this a try on your next Vegas trip.",

Rolando and the food made such a good impression, we came back for lunch and late dinner on Friday. Yes, we ate here 3 times in less than 24 hours.   Food and service were great.   Highly recommended.   Back in Vegas for the weekend, and stopped in 2 more times. Definitely didn't disappoint. Food and atmosphere are wonderful.

We ended up getting the Chicken Breast Tacos (just the 3 tacos, not the meal set) and the Golden Knights Nachos. The tacos were okay. There was a lot of chicken on them, but it was a bit dry. The nachos though - those were delicious! The meat was juicy and tender, and the toppings were generous without making the chips soggy or anything. The flavors were pretty well balanced, not too spicy or salty. They were definitely the star of the show. I'm interested in coming back and trying more of their nachos and their flaming items!",

Kelsey never came back to the table until it was time to pick up the bill which another sever has to bring because she was no where to be found..( I wish I would've gotten her name)..  Kelsey takes my credit card and brings back only the receipt, I had to get up and go find her and was like where is my credit card, she runs to the back to get it saying oh I'm sorry..   she knew exactly what she was doing.  I believe she is a racist....   The sever who helped me got her tip...    WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD WITH KELSEY!!!!!!",

She made sure where she was going to seat us was going to be mist comfortable for my husband in a wheelchair. She sat us nit too long after checking in.  Once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food. As we were sitting there it seemed a little long if a wait for our food but no sooner we mentioned it there it was.   I ordered the chicken fajitas which came out nice and hot and had tons of onions and peppers. My husband ordered the filet mignon nachos. When my food came out it didn't come with the plate that had the sides and the tortillas, so I had to wait for the server to come back.   Over all the food was great, hostess was awesome server had a few flaws. It was nice that management waived my meal since I didn't get everything timely. I would def come back here when I'm in town.",

The place is kind of hidden past the Taco Bell Cantina as it may appear you're going to hit a dead end by the elevators. Atmosphere was nice as it had a very western, Texas, Mexican feel. Ordered the cheese enchiladas, rice and beans combo and tacos. Left the place spending less than $25 for 2 people. Not a bad deal at all! While waiting there we had one girl who kept coming out to throw up in the corner and then going back in and coming back out to throw up again using her finger. Maybe have a person standing in the front to monitor such people. Overall, a good visit and good tasting food.",

The food was good, we had the burger nachos for appetizer, they were delicious, gooey cheese and beef almost on every chip. I had the grilled fish tacos for my entree, again solid, they were not cheap with the filets. The soft flour tortillas were cooked alittle to make them crispy, and the mango salsa was a nice touch. My friend had the smothered burrito, it looked very good. Neither one of us could finish our meals. There was only one thing preventing this restaurant from a 5 star rating and that was the service. The server did not write down our order, even though I asked him if he could remember everything including the modifications we ordered. He assured me \"I got this\", needless to say the app came out wrong. Other then that he was friendly and nice. I would definitely recommend this place as a causal place to visit when u don't want to pay the outrageous prices they charge in other restaurants on the strip.",

The free margarita for breakfast by checking in - sure why not?!   Our waitress was friendly and gave awesome service.  It was only a short walk off the strip so convenient to get to and our kids loved the food as well as the scorpions.  Would definitely go back next time we're in Vegas.",

Will come back again to try breakfast menu.",

Not only with me but other patrons. A couple next to me asked about strip bars and he whipped out his phone and started giving them suggestions. Just a nice and sincere server.

What she recommended (burrito bowl) isn't marked as gluten free, but by subbing for wild rice it was perfectly fine. She even made sure with me what to sub with in case the wild rice wasn't gluten-free. The chips are fried in the same fryer that they fry some flour tortillas in, so that was lame, but the burrito bowl was delicious anyway.  We also each ordered a margarita and when they took a long time to come out, someone who we assume is a manager came over and apologized and said they'd comp the drinks. We seriously considered ordering one to go as a thank you, but they're so much drink and the portions are generous so we left too full for another drink, even split between two people.",

It's located right outside Planet Hollywood on Harmon Ave. This one is definitely a lot bigger than the downtown spot & has some pretty cool, trendy decorations.  Service wise I could tell some kinks still needed to be worked out like having a hostess up front and ready to greet people. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar during visit so our bartender was great. She was super friendly and quick.   As for the food they have various options like enchiladas, tacos, salads and obviously nachos. They have a decent handful of vegan and vegetarian options which is awesome. I had the loaded nachos this most recent time which were quite tasty. The only downside for me was that the chips get soggy too quickly.   Overall I'd come back to this location again if I'm around the strip and would recommend it for others visiting to check it out.",

The restaurant is loud and fun but makes you want to move and dance while waiting for your food. They have a great variety of options and will surprise you with the different flavors in their creative nacho dishes!  When I visited Nacho Daddy with two others we ordered: The Moco Loco Nachos, Lobster & Crab Enchiladas and Chicken Tamale. The table favorite was the Moco Loco Nachos. It was so delicious that I stopped eating my own plate (enchiladas) to eat this plate more! Although I didn't get to try the Chicken Tamale, my friend was raving about it and cleaned her entire plate. The Lobster & Crab Enchiladas were a risk and unfortunately weren't my favorite. I only finished one with the help of my husband. It may just not have been a dish for me. The flavors didn't go together so well and were in no comparison to the Loco Nachos.   I rate this place 5 stars and will visit again because there were so many options, the service was good and the restaurant was clean and upbeat. Loved the music selection and vibe overall. Try it out - you won't be disappointed.",

The staff was super friendly, especially since we looked like we came from a pool party, haha. Also, who doesn't love a free house margarita for checking in on Yelp?!",

Thank you for taking great care of us Alex. She recommended a bottled beer when my husband was being picky and he really enjoyed it.  I had a glass of the happy hour white wine and it hit the spot.  We shared happy hour bbq chicken nachos and they were so tasty, we ordered a second round of them. We also loved the southwest chimichangas, super crisp on the outside, rich and tasty on the inside.   We watched someone take a scorpion shot and although it's fun to watch, I don't think that will ever land on my bucket list. The aquarium with scorpions in it is pretty cool!",

There was a small wait for a table, but seats opened up at the bar so we jumped in. Our server was Elise, very helpful and attentive. We used the \"check in\" on the Yelp app for our free house margaritas. Not the best I ever drank but they were free! We ordered the guacamole and chips as our appetizer. The guacamole had bits of tomato mixed in and a very good flavor with a little spice (jalapeno?). The chips were crispy with a touch of salt and held up without breaking during scooping. I ordered the grilled fish tacos with mango salsa, delicious! My husband ordered the chicken tacos that he said were equally delicious. We left feeling stuffed and wishing for bigger stomachs to eat more. This is definitely a great place to visit and I'll keep it on my list for my next visit to Vegas.",

    "text": "Oh my gosh nachos for days!!! I don't think there would ever be a day when I would turn down nachos. This place is so good that my family ate here two nights in a row.   We eat mainly vegetarian food, and they had an entire separate vegan menu. I appreciate Mexican restaurants that are starting to provide more vegetarian options. And their vegan menu truly emulates their regular menu, with a variety of options. The two star dishes for us were the vegan fajitas and the massive vegetarian nachos.   They fire the fajitas at your table so it's really a sizzler. It's not all just show - the flavors all come through amazingly, blending the veggies, soy chicken, sauces, etc. I probably ate 2 or 3 fajitas all on my own.   Now onto the nachos!!! These are massive omg. We shared them for the 4 of us and everyone got a good amount of nachos. They top them with all the goodies - including guac, beans, sour cream, jalapenos, etc. If I could, I would just order nachos and eat a whole plate of these without ordering any entrees.   Ok the cherry on top - Yelp check ins get a free margarita!! Nachos + margaritas? Night made. You can upgrade to a special margarita and just pay the difference between the house marg and the special one. Pretty great deal if you ask me.   Final words - service was great for a busy restaurant on the Strip. Our waitresses on both nights were accommodating to our preferences and attentive to when we needed them at the table. I'd come back here 10 out of 10 times!",

We tried the Fiesta nachos, supreme toastada nacho(fave), & chicken chimichanga (which is huge).  We did the #scorpionshot and one of the (off duty) bartenders did it with us. It's a small pickled scorpion in a tequila shot that you swallow whole. Overall Nacho Daddy was a fun & unique experience which is quite a lot to say considering it's Vegas!",

We order the Thai Nacho, considering the fact I'm half Thai and never would even thought of anyone coming up with this dish was pretty amazing! Along with corn on the cob, and ceviche and some beers and don't forget too TRY the scorpion shot it's a must! Desiree our server extremely persistence, down too earth, and made us feel like home! By far the whole experiment was awesome, good energy and most important good vibes",

The food portions were smaller than should be, toppings scarce and waitress not well informed or may have been stoned.  Either way, I was totally underwhelmed.    If I am opening a new location I make sure the nachos are loaded with cheese and toppings.  Not the case.  This is nachos, not beef wellington.  Should not have been that hard.  Maybe they need to send their staff to the other locations to see what it SHOULD be.  If they can't afford food costs which have to be maybe 10%, don't bother.  And neither should you.",

She made wonderful suggestions, provided kind service, and engaged us with small talk and banter to make the meal that much better.  We had nachos, the daddy michelada (OMG YUM), and the peach margarita (yummmmmm).  The service was so good that we decided to come back.  I returned yesterday for breakfast and once again this place did not disappoint.  Our food and the service were once again top notch!  Brandon was sooo helpful and so nice.  He was our food runner and while there I mentioned that all of the employees were nice and constantly on the move running from place to place.  Hats off to the management, you've done good!",

There are also a bunch of birds inside, which I wasn't a huge fan of because it felt like they were going to fly into me or poop on me.  There's a free margarita with check-in, and they do NOT skimp on the alcohol. You can have it either regular or blended, or even upgrade to a fancier margarita and just pay the difference.  The nacho servings here are so huge that we shared 1 plate of nachos for every 2 people. My friend and I got the spicy shrimp nachos and we loved them!! They're a perfect amount of spicy, and the shrimp is seasoned and so flavorful!! I love how there are so many toppings that no chip has to be eaten dry.  The prices are more than reasonable too- I believe our spicy shrimp nachos were $18.95. We paid less than $10 each for a huge plate of nachos and a margarita!",

    "text": "The free margarita check in offer drew us here, as well as the pics of good looking nachos. We were freaked out by the photos of the scorpion shots (not our kind of deal), but actually the tank with a few scorpions in it at the front was pretty cool. I hope they keep those ones alive.  For our late night dinner/snack, we shared the Thai chicken nachos, which are interestingly made with spinach chips. Portions were sizeable and the chicken was well flavored. The veggies turned out to be bean sprouts and bell peppers. Overall happy with the food, it was a nice light dish without being too heavy.  Gabby was our server, and she was awesome! She got us both margaritas, including one strawberry margarita. Yum!",

I wasn't sure that I would like fried avocado, but it worked. The salsa was perfect because the batter wasn't really seasoned, so it wouldn't have tasted good without it. The queso was also good. The toppings have to be stirred in otherwise it could be bland. I ordered a root beer, but it looked like they had a really good selection of alcohol if interested. I sent my husband back the next day to get more queso for me.   Service: because I went by myself, I just sat at the bar. Rebecka was very nice and checked on me fairly often.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Elara and was looking for a tasty relatively inexpensive place to eat aside from the big names (that suck) on the strip. Yelp came to the rescue and I saw the Nacho Daddy was within the Miracle Mile which is connected to the Elara. It feels like you're exiting the property which you are but when you turn right, the establishment is right there close to - couple yards from the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd. If you sit outside you can hear and see a lot of the hustle of the strip.   Nachos were really good, I was happy to see all the vegetarian options. I would have liked my nachos to be more cheesy. They were perfectly spiced however and the flavors all melded very well. Huge portions and so two people can easily share. I had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good. I was happy with the prospect that I could take it to go as I had an early morning but still wanted to enjoy it back in my room. They had live music while I was there and it was a fun little joint to enjoy when you sort of just want to get away from what is the strip. Will defiantly be back when in Vegas. Not for that scorpion shot though!",

They have an entire section for Vegans. All the food selections looked delicious. We chose several different dishes and shared them between the 3 of us. The food was incredible! The flavor was unbelievablely tasty and fresh. I couldn't get over it! I went back the next day and had the chocolate cake and coffee. Like the rest of the food it looks as good as it tastes. They brought out my very own French press, a classy touch. Thank you especially to the wait staff Ally, Ari (sp)? and Peter the manager. They all had terrific attitudes! FYI they are opening one in Georgia for those of us who live on the East coast. * I wanted to add that this restaurant is not solely Vegan, but that they have a terrific selection and how thankful I am that they have Vegan food!!",

We liked this place so much, we came twice on our vacation!   The bottomless chips and salsa were great! I got the chicken enchiladas (smothered in queso) the first time and Daddy's Bowl the second. I liked how my server allowed me to create my own crispy tortilla bowl. That was my favorite out of the two meals.   Our strawberry margarita was a bit more than free because we got a flavor add-in, but that was fine. The only downfall was that the margaritas weren't strong at all; they tasted like a slurpee from 7-Eleven (which was delicious)! On our last visit, we got the regular house margarita (it wasn't strong either). You would think being in Vegas the drinks would have more liquor, but no complaints because it was free.   I personally thought this restaurant wasn't that  expensive, which is another reason why I enjoyed it. The food filled me for a great price! I plan on visiting Nacho Daddy again when I travel to Vegas!",

The breakfast taco was served on  possibly the most yummy soft shelled taco I've ever tasted, however the eggs were smothered in a queso sauce... so it simply wasn't what I expected. Keep it simple, eggs and a strip of bacon would have been perfect.   My wife had the chicken taco.  The shell was the highlight, it was also very good.  Cool spot on the Strip and very good service.  Rachel took excellent care of us.  Super quick, super smiley and upbeat for dealing with many Vegas hangovers.",

Had the bacon cheese rancheros and the Chilaquilas with bottomless mimosas!  Our service was impeccable!  Bartenders are very friendly.   Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

Don't feel like paying $20 for a margarita or $30 for a meal? Turn the corner and go here because it's amazing! My husband ordered the Thai Nachos and had no complaints! We sat at the bar and had the best service of the entire weekend. The street tacos were just as good if not better than any local Mexican place in soCal. Most importantly, the drinks are strong and yummy! Definitely give this place a try if you're on this end of the strip!",

My Father got the Nacho Supreme I tried it and it was great, too my Aunt and Uncle got the Filet Mignon Nachos they were very good, also. We got the Queso appetizer and that was just as superb. The only issue I had was that the menu doesn't specify if the jalapenos are picked or fresh for each meal. So I suggest asking if you care. We will definitely be going back next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "My wife and I had just finished the Rock and Roll 5K and were looking for something relatively quick and near our timeshare. This place was right across from the hotel (it's part of PH's Miracle Mile Shops), and it was new, so we opted to try it out. As it was Saturday night, there was a fairly long line, of course, so we were expecting a ~15-minute wait. The host hooked us up, though, by giving us a spot at the bar - probably since we were the only, or one of the only, couple(s) (i.e., nongroup) there.  In my at times utterly futile, but steadfast, quest to go vegetarian, I went right to the menu's vegan section (it's quite a nice selection, BTW), and opted for the Vegan Chick'n Tacos. It came with wild rice, black beans, chipotle onions and salsa (along with the chick'n, obviously). Honestly, this faux chicken tasted as close to actual poultry as anything I can remember in some time - marinated nicely, fresh, cooked just right. Really good. The beans and rice went well with all of that. Didn't mess with the chipotle onions too much - whew, were they hot! Between my lemonade and water I was guzzling for a couple minutes there.  Not a drinker, so can't speak about the quality of their spirits; the Ms. enjoyed her Mai Tai, FWeTW, as well as the chicken - the \"e\" included - enchiladas (and they did look really good).  I wish I'd gotten our bartender/server's name - she was a hoot! Energetic, attentive, and friendly. The atmosphere was laid-back and relaxed, at least at the bar.  All told, everything came out to ~$40 or so - not bad for what turned out to be dinner on the Strip.  Glad we tried this spot. Will definitely return next visit to Sin City.  (Sorry for the pic-less review - I'm new to Yelping. Next time, though!)",

Two of my friends took the scorpion shot! I wouldn't do it myself but it's definitely a fun experience, and that's what makes this place so unique.

However they do have some other options like burritos and enchiladas to choose from.  We got a Daddy Margarita (basically a house marg) and a nacho supreme with beef. The nachos were pretty good, decent sized for $19. You do have to order chips and salsa separate for $3 if you're wanting some.   The service was meh. I felt like it took a long time and was a definite buzzkill to the frozen daiquiri I drank before.  Inside is cool - lots of different decorations like old bookshelves, western decor & much more.  Nacho Daddy is located right next to the new Buffalo Wild Wings outside and around the corner from Planet Hollywood.  Check in on Yelp to get a free house margarita!",

Located on the south side of the Planet Hollywood building, Nacho Daddy is a hub of great Mexican cuisine and fun Las Vegas drinks and music. With waves of people coming in throughout the night, laughing and drinking on the patio, you will always feel like you belong. The bartenders have a laid back, but attentive, attitude while mixing a delicious house margarita (which was in fact on the house when I checked in on yelp)!  I had the Fajitas, wings, chips and salsa and the blanco queso - I actually didn't order the cheese dip, but it was seriously good on everything. I ended up dipping my wings in it, putting it on my fajitas and of course dipping my chips in it.   One of the owners was there that night and he was hanging and partying with the chef, who was a lot younger than I thought he would have been.   An overall fun night and I look forward to making Nacho Daddy my return to place in Vegas!  Enjoy!",

I get the holidays and such but there were servers and bartenders looking at us and no one could even acknowledge or say hold on a second that sort of killed my vibe.  They have cute stuff like #getstung if you down get the scorpion shot.  I got the crab and lobster enchilada  and it was just okay when I had the meat without the anything else it sort of tasted meh like just defrosted. The rice was really good and so was the queso.  LOVEEEE ME SOME GOOD QUESO.  My boyfriend got the mojo pork tacos and it was really meaty and juicy but I really wish it had more seasoning it was missing something.  also they offer a margarita when you do yelp check in and that was pretty good.",

The place looks awesome, food from a distance looked great, staff lighting food on fire was cool. We ordered our shots waited with anticipation till the bomb was dropped. Our waitor says \"we are out of scorpion, actually its company wide outage\" Company wide scorpion shortage? Your claim to fame? Waitor just found out? Hmmm  Out nachos arrived looked awesome smelled awesome, and that's about as good as it got. Lots of chips very little cheese. I realize maybe I have eaten at one to many fuzion and pub establishments that have pampered my lust for large amounts of cheese, but let's face it. Perfect nachos don't run out of the complementing ingredient way before the chips! So two strikes...  Maybe next time I'll give it a shot as long as scorpion are back",

I dislike Vegas, but that shouldn't be a limiting factor on my ability to spend money quietly. Nacho daddy seems like a good bar. They merely have a simple minded and below average manager on duty. 2/10 will only go back to support the real team there. Fix your management problem and I will spend far too much at nacho daddy.",

This company I must say really does care about the customers and their experience here.   My bad experience was heard, and was offered a gift card (which I accepted the offer)  I'm now talking to another HR person Peter who  wants to hear my experience at nachodaddy also. I'm very impressed how quickly they responded to my Yelp review and my email and my call. I'm really hoping the next time I come to nacho daddy I will have a better experience with the staff.  And my food experience remains the same. The nachos I had ( enchilada nachos) were very very yummy.",

Located outside the Miracle Mile Shops on Harmon Nacho Daddy portions are large the 2 of us split a plate of the CHICKEN TINGA NACHOS )Tender chicken breast marinated in our own smoky chipotle & tomato tinga sauce, yellow queso, melted Jack & Cheddar cheese, refried beans, sour cream, avocado, pickled onions, & queso fresco on top of our house-made chips) which are a Vegas thing and were so delicious.  Each plate of Nachos is around $15  Plus since we were there during Happy Hour we split 2 street Tacos and each had a strawberry margarita.    The wait for a table was 20 mins which I did find odd since there were alot of empty tables so we sat at the bar which was fine.  Only two complaints I would have are one the ladies restrooms were dirty and dark, the other was there were 2 young women at the bar who were drunk ( 3 shots each in 15 mins) were asking the bartenters if they had real breast or implants & asked to feel one of the bartenders breast.    I chalked it up to being in Vegas",

Unfortunately when I got robbed of my phone my pictures were in my phone :( so I didn't get to post my savory eats.  First off this establishment is in Planet Hollywood which is one of my Favorite spots on the strip. Upon arrival we were greeted there were families and kids here but we opted to sit at the bar.  The Bartender was friendly but the drink I ordered sucked. It was too strong and did not taste like a bended Margarita should taste like. The bartender was more than happy to craft a home made Margarita that my taste buds liked.  The music was amazing and I was tempted to get up and dance but not the time and place. But it hit all the points for me good food and second time around good drinks.  I ordered my Signature nacho which was Chileques Nachos with red sauce. It was good, I also got to try the Enchiladas nachos which I was not a fan of at all! But I liked my nacho. After being here for a few hours it was packed! The staff was very friendly and informative. They also have their signature Scorpion shot - which if I was an adventurous person I would have tried but I'm not!   It is definitely a nice place to try Nachos you would not have thought to try, the atmosphere is amazing and fun. They even have catering I believe because every time I come to Vegas I see Nacho Daddy cars on the freeway.  Definitely a great place to try! I highly recommend. Enjoy!",

Love that they have vegan and gluten-free options! This makes me sooo happy, since I have so many vegan/gf friends that never really get options, this is the perfect place!   Service // friendly, quick, and checked up on us every once in awhile!  Atmosphere // they have big screens playing old music videos (example: alternative, rock, etc..) wooden interior - almost like their were going for old timey dessert west   Food // OMG where to start, but AMAZEBALLS  -Ceviche // hearty shrimp and a generous amount of chips with just the right amount of tang and sour from the lemon juice, yum!   -Lobster and Crab nacho // kind of rich for me, but my bf looked mighty happy also sweaty, because it has quite a bit of kick! Those jalapenos though!   -Margarita pitcher // their margarita was amazing , i don't remember which one it was but I'm sure they all taste great!   Overall // I would be down to come back!

The server brought our drinks and chips and took our food orders. This would be the last time we saw him for over 45 minutes. No drink refills or \"unlimited\" chips and salsa refills. It took about 30 minutes to get our food (not horrible), but is was brought by other staff. We didn't see our server for at least 15 more minutes.

The inside is fun and funky and leaves plenty of opportunities for a good Instagram shot.   Service was on point. Everyone was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I'm super indecisive and they were patients and gave great recommendations.  The food was AMAZING! My boyfriend and I shared multiple things and I couldn't complain about any of it.   Drinks were also great and the staff was knowledgeable on different tequila and cocktails.

The guacamole is made fresh to order, the ground beef is premium quality and the drinks are superb (hands down the best margarita I had in Vegas).  The portion sizes make each entree shareable. The staff was super friendly and down to earth, my kinda vibe. There's nothing fancy about the venue, but who cares, it's all about the food.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, I didn't.  It doesn't seem to be mentioned much, but it's in a really strange location.  It's supposedly in Miracle Mile, but you have to go outside to get to it.  And there aren't even signs inside telling you where to go.  If I could have found it on my first trip to Vegas, I'd have gone here then, but I never walked by it.  If I hadn't looked at a map this time, I'd have never found it.  I always knew people really liked it here, and Mexican is my favorite, but once I saw they had a vegan menu, I had to go!  I am vegetarian rather than vegan, but I love veggie chicken, and there aren't many places that have it, so I had to check it out.  It was a Wednesday at lunch time, and there were not many people here.  It was just me, so I sat at the bar.  They do full service at the bar, and if you check in on Yelp, you get a free margarita.  I did this, and used the amount as a credit toward the White Peach margarita.  The margarita was fantastic!  I'd have gotten another one except that I was really hungry, and I didn't want to drink that much on an empty stomach.  I ordered the quesadillas with the vegan chick'n.  I really wanted the nachos, but there was just too much on them that I didn't want, and I feel ridiculous when I order something and don't get half of what comes on it.  In hindsight, I wish I'd have tried those though.  The tortillas on the quesadilla were hard.  They were crispy, and if you pulled on it, it would break off.  I'm used to a softer tortilla.  And the cheese inside was very runny.  I tried to pick up the quesadilla to dip it, and I couldn't,  The tortilla would fall apart and the cheese would run out.  I ended up eating it with a fork, which was odd, but ok.  Maybe the cheese was so runny because it's vegan?  I'm not sure.  And the chick'n was ok, but again, nothing special.  It was pretty flavorless.  The sour cream and guacamole with them were both good though, and I wouldn't have known it was vegan.  So overall, I was pretty disappointed with my meal.  It was fine, but nothing I'd ever want again.  I'd try the chick'n in something else though, but I definitely wouldn't get the quesadillas again.  I was possibly going to order something to go for dinner one night, but I wasn't walking over there in the dark alone.  It's not in a great location, and there was a homeless guy rolling around on the sidewalk the first time I went.  I really wish it was inside the mall, or there was a way to get to it from inside.  So overall, the margarita was awesome.  The quesadillas were not.  So if you like Mexican, or you're vegetarian, I'd still say you could try this place, but order something else.",

    "text": "Welp, I think this place was over-hyped for me. With 3,000+ Yelp reviews, I was expecting some amazing nachos, and Nacho Daddy just didn't deliver.  First thing to know: this restaurant is not located on The Strip. That wasn't clear to me on a map, but it's actually a block or two down a side street. And unfortunately, after our walk to find it, we had super slow service and just kinda okay food. The margaritas (free with Yelp check-in) were waaaay too sour. And as a self-proclaimed nacho addict, I thought the chips were flimsy and the toppings lacking in flavor. The concept was cool, and the food wasn't bad by any means. But the actual experience was just kinda like a bad nacho take on Chili's.   If you do come here though, definitely split an item! Everything we ordered was way too much for one person, despite what our server told us. Bonus: that makes the $18+ pricing easier to stomach too.",

We ordered the guacamole and chips, and it was a pretty decent size. The guacamole has a little spice, so if you don't like that...I'd steer clear. My friend ordered a burrito and it was the size of about 3-4 pushed together. It is served with the sauce of your choosing, salsa, sour cream, etc. I ordered the fiesta nachos and they were stacked and all covered! Chicken, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, etc. Such a good nacho plate and definitely well worth it. Very big portions though, so come in hungry! We only ate about half of our plates each because we didn't expect that and weren't super hungry. We sat at the bar cause the wait to be seated was about 15 minutes, but it worked for us! They do have other options other than nachos, so check out their menu! Staff was polite and took care of us.",

For meals, my wife went with chicken soft tacos, I went with the pork version.  Outstanding!  Good sized portions and nice heat!  I like spicy food and these had a decent kick.  Next time, I'll see if they can boost the heat a little in my order.   This was an overall really good experience; service, food and value.

I think the nachos steal the show and are the highlight here. The prices here are also pretty steep, $18 for nachos and entrees around $13-15.   There are plenty of options for everyone, even salads and all day breakfast which I love.  All is Mexican except for one entree for breakfast: churros pancakes (still Mexican inspired).   We took advantage of the free checkin offer of free margarita with the order of an entree. They also offer 5% cash back with yelp so make sure you register your credit cards.    We wish they had some more outdoor seating to enjoy the day but we sat at the bar and enjoyed the sun still. Inside the restaurant I always feel like it's dark. You will not leave here hungry that is for sure so if you need some drunk food, they are open late and if you need to cure a hangover this is a great place too.  I love the vegan chick'n and love love that they have it here. Thanks for thinking of us non-meat eaters! Cheers",

One thing that's amazing is that they are supper flexible with their menus and could work around to make what's best for you. If you get the change get the chimichurri steak nacho with fries instead of tortilla chips it's definitely the best combo. When they brought out our food, they gave a great show by putting the chicken fajitas on fire. Lastly their house margaritas came in a cute mason jar and it just went great with the food.",

It's best to walk along the front of Planet Hollywood, and wrap around it until you get to a small side street. Nachos aren't exactly a brunch food, but my bf and I did some nacho brunchin' that day. The supreme tostada nachos were loaded, crunchy, and tasty. I ordered it without beans bc beans tend to make my nachos soggy. My bf and I also shared the fajitas. I would pass on the fajitas next time as our order did not have much meat in it. We enjoyed our free frozen margaritas with yelp check-in. Our server was super friendly. I would def come back for some more nachos next time I'm in Vegas.",

It's probably done to cover up how little filet is actually in the nachos, also not confident it's filet. Tasty but meh   It was okay. I don't think I'd come back for those nachos.

He was teaching an impromptu salsa class to a bachelorette party while chatting up a nearby table of WWII Purple Heart veterans, impressing them with his deep knowledge of twentieth century post-war geopolitics. At the same time he was calmly performing the heimlich on an over excited frat boy. All smiles, casually exuding Bill Clinton levels of charisma, Javony welcomed us to Nacho DaddyTM.   The conversation zigged and zagged between unconscious bias, the Syrian refugee crisis, Chinese calligraphy, and his recent paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. His fresh take on tired issues reinvigorated my views and forced me to question everything I knew. The hours flew by - as I felt the conflicts between mind, soul, and body melt away in his calming presence.   Javony would never say this himself but following his double stint in the peace corps (Malawi and Haiti) he donated both kidneys (and two thirds of his liver) to a baby panda.  Having passively made millions in Silicon Valley selling his car safety algorithm to Tesla (saving millions of future lives), Jovany decided that with all options ahead of him and no need to work a day in his life, he would help people from all over the world find their True selves. What better place to do that than Nacho DaddyTM Las Vegas - the veritable crossroads of human civilization (try the queso it's like making out with Buddha Jesus and Moses at the same time).  I can only hope you, too, can share even a moment, a glance, a thought, a smile, or a margarita with Jovany at Nacho DaddyTM - a professional human being.",

Then the manager replied in 2 Minutes to let me know they make them in house fresh daily which is almost unbelievable because as I've said, they taste like cheap store bought chips that are so thin and tasteless that they break and crumble before you can even scoop anything on them, so I've now changed this to 3 stars because the chips are an epic fail.",

What better to do before the club then have some nachos and shots. Our server was amazing. I wish I could remember his name but he's been working there for a while. Rocker style and has had over 100 scorpions while working here. I did my free margarita for checking in through yelp and my the margaritas are good here. Decided to do a whole round for everything. The nachos were off the hook. Lobster was my favorite. Fajitas and wings were good as well. Our server even took a video for us and was so informative. He even held our shot glasses for us until tomorrow morning. I do recall before leaving I let his manager know about his extraordinary service. I've been recommending this place to all my friends. Seeing this place on yelp, it didn't really appeal to me but I was so glad I came!!!!  Can't wait till my next vegas trip",

    "text": "Ok..Nacho Daddy has been on my radar to visit for a while based upon the stellar reviews and my love of nachos. Visited on Saturday-1st weekend of March Madness around 11am. Walked in, got seated right away and promptly greeted by our Server. Drinks came out quick and we ordered our food-very accommodating on being able to order exactly what you want, with exactly what you do or do not want on it. My GF ordered a crispy taco which she said was pretty good and she is very critical when it comes to tacos. I ordered the fiesta nachos-Now this is where it goes from 5 stars down to 4 stars. They looked amazing when they were delivered to the table! Now the bad part-all the chips were soggy and mushy. When I order nachos, I am expecting crunchy chips, not mushy chips. I think they may have sat on the counter a little too long before they were delivered to the table causing them to be soggy, or maybe this is just how they are are prepared. The flavors were great and the chicken was very tender(and there was a lot of it on the nachos!)I know the Managers or Owners read their reviews and actually care, so if this is how they are prepared, maybe you could offer some crunchy chips on the side so you can have that crunchy nacho effect. Overall, great service, good tacos, but the jury is out on the nachos. I will go back next time I am in Vegas, but not too sure if I would get the nachos again.",

It's a real scorpion (dead and stinger removed) that you put in a shot with tequila and go for it! My husband did it! He got a free shot glass!

We were immediately seated, and while being seated I had my phone open to the yelp app and a FREE MARGARITA promo appeared. The waiter didn't even question it and asked me what FREE margarita I wanted. You can get the house margarita completely free or get a specialty margarita and pay the difference ($3). I got the jalapeno cucumber margarita and it was sooo good! Strong an did not taste artificial. Had big chunks of jalapenos and cucumber. My husband and I both ordered their famous nachos. Be for warned you can split it between 2 people, they're that big! I got the beef, my husband got the shrimp. Both were loaded with other toppings but literally not a dry chip on the plate. While mine was ok (not a fan of the flavoring of the beef. Reminded me of Taco Bell's beef.) my husbands was delicious! The shrimp nachos are VERY spicy but very good! We like spicy! I would def. return for the margarita, but next time I might just try something other than the nachos. Def. recommend Nacho Daddy if you're looking for a quick not \"fast food\" place to eat.",

We then ordered the Mexican corn, which was also tasty with the coho cheese, cilantro, chili and lime. All was delicious and very good. Chicken was shredded and juicy, not dry. Very impressed with this place and recommend if you like delicious Mexican food. Staff was nice and ambience was good. Prices were a little high, but portions were large so it balanced out.

    "text": "We came to this spot on New Years Day with high hopes from all of the Yelp reviews and after seeing numerous signs posted throughout The Miracle Mile Shops. The place was pretty quiet when we arrived, perhaps because people were still recovering from all of the excitement from the night before, or maybe because the location of the restaurant is off the beaten path... it sits on East Harmon a little away from the corner of Las Vegas Blvd, getting overshadowed by the infamous Taco Bell Cantina. We opted to sit at the bar and was greeted by the bartender immediately. We kept it simple and decided to share an order of Ultimate Supreme Nachos. They were good, not overly outstanding, and could've been warmer. I do appreciate that there was a really good toppings-to-chips ratio and the bartender even offered to bring a few extra chips, if needed. Pricewise, it was a little more than I'd prefer to pay for nachos but given that it was a restaurant near The Strip, the higher price is pretty much expected. Perhaps we will return again on the next trip and try out the seafood nachos.",

Our friends decided to have a few drinks in our suite and grub on some to go food so we ordered from Nacho Daddy and Hot N Juicy (located next door). I was slightly surprised that Nachos would cost so much, but realized that we are getting food on the Strip so I considered myself lucky. The staff was quick and our food was ready before we even arrived! the nachos were great paired with our drinks. The only downside I would say would be that there wasn't as much topping for the chips, but it could also have been because it was to go and not dine in. It was delicious and totally worth it none the less. Definitely recommend for anyone who loves a good nacho!!!",

    "text": "My first encounter with Nacho Daddy was late at night, when I had a little fun and found myself ravenous. I ordered the vegan loaded nachos and had them delivered to my hotel. In 30 min, I had a pile of perfectly gooey nachos at my disposal. Their vegan nacho cheese is legit!!! This is not a couple of daiya shreds thrown about, this is cheeeeeese, on every single chip. They loaded them up right, with smoky, spicy salsa and beans. They were so good, my cheese-hating (vegan or otherwise) husband dived right in with me. Thank god, too, because there were a ton of nachos!  My second encounter was when I stumbled upon their storefront just when I was feeling hungry. I saddled up to the bar and was served by Scarlett, who was super sweet and made me feel right at home. It's hard eating alone anywhere, but in Vegas it can feel especially isolating. I felt right at ease with my complimentary margarita (free when you check in!), chick'n tacos, and vintage Kelly Clarkson.  I love that this chill place has lots of vegan options, delivery, and multiple locations across Vegas. I don't love the tank of scorpions, and how they dare you to take a scorpion shot. Eek! Creepy and unkind, not a great mix. The nachos are fantastic, though, and I look forward to coming back after a fun night on the town.",

The beans were excellent, the eggs were tasty, chips with sauce was decent but needed a little more sauce. The salsa was supposed to be hot, but was really more mild to medium, so don't expect hot. I did have the free House Margarita because of my check-in. It was just ok. Seems like very little alcohol, but it was free, so no complaints. Overall, prices were decent and good was worth it.

I wasn't hungover when I came here, but I bet this place would hit the spot after a wild night out. We ordered the Fiesta Nachos and the kitchen staff at Nacho Daddy did it right. The nachos were mixed with both rich (cheese, refried beans, guacamole, and sour cream) and savory ingredients (pico de gallo, sauteed onions, salsa, and chicken). The pico de gallo actually fooled me into believing I was being a little healthy. LOL.   Service was okay. It was early when we went and I don't think they were all that attentive, but we were fine with it. There's no rush when you're in Vegas anyway.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a fast & furious happy hour on a Monday afternoon at NotYoDaddy, and were pleased with the freshness of the viddles and potency of the libations without being overly sweet. NotYoDaddy could've been content to be lame, them being located on the strip(kinda) but totally showed up to work with pride. We had queso, margaritas, and a Pacifico to start out our afternoon of debauchery in Vegas.    We were slightly slowed up by fiending out on the queso that was super rich, but was garnished with sliced serranos, onion, tomato and jalapenos that provided a little acidity to cut through the fat, but only made it easier to shove in our faces so vigorously, therefore making us exhausted but still scraping out the little plastic molcajete that it came to us in. We still had a bit of sense at that time and ordered some happyhour taquitos, chimichangas, and a Kale entree salad from the regular menu to go along with the 4 fritas (frozen margaritas) and 5 tequila shots we each had over the next 90 or so minutes bellied up to the bar. Needless to say, it was hammertime in wifeypoo&markypoo's head but managed to make it back to the Cosmo with some to-go leftover nibbles in hand. We paid a paltry 82ish pesos americanos and tipped our cracker-jack bar attendant 30 buckarinos for recognizing that she was dealing with 2 happyhour True play-uhz like your humble narrator and his beautiful lady. MOS DEF will be back for another happyhour at Nacho Daddy's. We were quite pleased with ourselves for doing our Yelp  homework prior, but were even more pleased with N.D. (Smileyface)",

We also have micheladas and they were bomba! We were so excited to find such a vegan friendly place. We travel alot and we always have such a hard time finding vegan friendly places. At the end of our meal i got the vegan chocolate cake. Although no one could tell me what it was made of besides that there was oreos in it which the bartender informed us that oreos are indeed vegan me and my husband looked at eachother like no way! But a quick google search informed us that it was False bummed! But the cake was still delicous ;)   Our second night we had crispy avocado street tacos, spicy burrito and the grilled corn with sour cream instead of mayo and the lovely waitress gave me the option to have the corn cut off the cob! I even had a non alcoholic michelada this time and it tasted just as great! I loved every dish at this place im super bummed we live so far away. Nacho daddy has a loyal customer anytime i come to vegas!",

I wish I would've tasted the spinach ones though.   Second time we got the buffalo chhicken again (the white queso is yummy) and the tostada nachos. I think out of the four, the tostada nachos are the largest. Two orders were enough to share for sure.   The place is a little confusing to find; make sure you turn left (southbound) on Harmon from Las Vegas boulevard. It's there on the left.

There was nothing happy about the hour I was with Nacho Daddy. Except the GM Peter flirting and from his mouth \"spoiling his women bartenders.\" The bartenders on duty left their sink running for awhile causing their area to flood. They left out a flood fan which caused the bar area to smell like whatever was on their shoes. With better supervision I think this place has real potential to bring back return customers. The food was decent but the happy hour margarita made me wish I want to a near by restaurant. I kept having to add water to it because it was too sweet.",

From its grand entry way to the gigantic tv screens and it seemed as if there weren't any bad areas to be seated  in this place and the overall atmosphere was vibrant even at 11am on a Sunday am.   Of course I had the vegan nachos and the portions were large enough for us to share one plate. These nachos were simply AMAZING !!! Every bite was better than the last and I was in vegan queso heaven. I checked in through Yelp which presented us with a free margarita       Our waitress let us know that we could have any Margarita with $8 off if we didn't want the one they were offering for free. So of course we upgraded and grabbed two with $8 off of each drink. I'm not much of a margarita guy but I will definitely reconsider from now on. In addition to these delicious margaritas I was given a birthday shot of.....I'm sorry I forget what it was called as I became pretty tipsy by that point (I will find out later).   Our waitress displayed exceptional customer service. She was knowledgeable, accommodating and delivered prompt service to our table.  I do not remember her name either but I'm sure she remembers us .   There is so much to love about this place that I can't write enough about it to express my overall satisfaction. In addition to how awesome Nacho Daddy is (love the name btw) they have MULTIPLE Vegan options so that everyone can enjoy their delicious nachos.    I had a very happy birthday here and I will definitely return to Nacho Daddy for more nachos, only this time I will not be sharing    Side note: they are a little pricey so come with enough cash and be sure to tip their wonderful customer service. They're well worth the price.",

The nachos are bomb, don't get me wrong and the Yelp Check-In to get you a free margarita was cool...but the service wasn't as great.   Let's talk about the food first. We all got nachos, you have to get the nachos, why would you get anything else at..Nacho Daddy. The plates you can easily share with two people but no. We all got our own plates = bad idea. The plates were good and I do recommend sharing since it is big. Or just go in there hungry cause we did and we finished our plates...again bad idea LOL.  We checked in with Yelp to get our free margarita and that was great...till the bill came. I know couple places that do this and if you don't check your receipts or they hear that you're on a business trip, they add on random things on your bill. Please always check your bill before you pay cause our waitress did not take off the drinks even though she knows it was FREE. She handed the bill to us not checking if it is correct?! So when we waved her down, we told her all three of us didn't get that taken off the bill, her response didn't seem like it was the first time she seen it happen. It sounded like \"I hope they don't realize I didn't take it off their bill\". Long story short, make sure to always check your bill before you pay~",

I shared the BBQ Pork Nacho with my husband, and we also got the house margaritas and Arnold Palmer's. Everything was perfect, and the food was out very quickly.   I wondered if one could feed both of us hungry people, and it totally did.  We sat and watched the Kentucky Derby on the huge TV's inside. What a fun spot.  For the price and location the food was incredible. I'll definitely be back!",

We ordered chimichangas which were ok, BBQ nachos which were pretty good, Thai tacos which we liked pretty well. It's obvious we didn't hate our food but I just didn't think it was worth the hype. The best part was the service, the bartender/server was great and the margarita was tasty and refreshing. If I could give 3 1/2 I would but just not a 4.",

My wife my stepson and I walked into a restaurant and while it was busy it didn't seem packed.  We were told it was a 25 minute wait.  The wait was accurate and we were sat by a very friendly hostess.  There was a pretty good delay between being sat and being greeted but once we were greeted our server was friendly and attentive.  We did not order any appetizers but I had three different margaritas.  I had the house (nacho daddy), the pineapple mint and a blueberry margarita I saw on a previous review but was told wasn't available but they made one for me.  My favorite was the house margarita.  Their sweet and sour mix was quite good.  For dinner I had the not your average burger nachos.  They were very good.  I added sour cream, but it was the ground beef, bacon and lettuce mix on top that really did it for me.  My son had the filet fajitas.  He destroyed them.  My wife had the burrito.  It was ok, it was a burrito.  Nothing really stood out about it.  The restrooms were tidy and this place has a great YELP check in incentive.  We will be back.",

When we got back to our hotel, the top layer of nachos were sticking to the top of the container and the enchiladas were just barely warm. However, the portions and flavor were decent, so I think the experience would be better if we were to dine in. That said, I wouldn't mind returning to dine in and to try some of their desserts! Friendly hostesses, and the interior seemed to be decorated nicely.",

I've been a good couple times but I will say every time I've went super random but I've had to wait on a waiter for long AsF. Idk why it's not like it's super busy every time I've been. Any the wait would be no problem if I was getting something small or to go but it's like super expensive and you want to tip well but slow services always equals not really trying to services customers to the best of you ability.. what good is eating out at restaurant and you feel forgotten about by you waiter? Just my opinion. I'm vegan and have enjoyed the burritos and drinks and I really liked the food there But I digress, I'm a perfectionist and an integral person. So I'm always thinking about what kind of review people would leave after an interaction with me in an employee customer service experience. Thanks for reading.",

I was very surprised by the staffs reply and I said to my family...we need to leave here the staff is awfully rude....I told them how I felt and there was NO response to try and get us to reconsider staying..I find it very sad since I have enjoyed many a meal here...oh well...have a nice day...",

To start off had a casa migos shot of tequila to get the taste buds going than ordered a dogfish IPA to sip. You know what hey say. Liquor before beer your in the clear. Than for appetizers our table started with the triple dip, and sizzling shrimp. For my entree I had the shrimp and steak fajita and my ___ that shizz was bomb dot com. Definitely a great first time experience. Would recommend this place. Thanks to our server for not being one of those boring order takers and making our experience a great one.",

Used my check-in offer for the house marg which was super sweet and not very buzz-inducing, but a nice gesture nonetheless.  Food came out quickly in generous portions. BBQ chicken nachos hit the spot and were packed with flavor, not lacking any meat or toppings. Their BBQ sauce is a surprising winner.  Now for our uninvited table guest...Lord knows if he came from outside or the terrarium up front, but a big juicy cricket hopped right on up to look me eye to eye just as I was finishing my nachos. Not very appetizing. The manager gave us 25% off the bill which amounted to about $6. Maybe more of a concession would've been made if I had bitten into the darn thing, but glad I had a gift certificate to use anyway to cover the rest.  I know eating scorpions is the thing here, but the only animal I wanted was chicken.",

    "text": "Went here for my birthday and was definitely a great place to celebrate!  Great menu especially if you're vegan such as myself. We ordered vegan chicken quesadillas, vegan loaded nachos, the vegan chicken chimichanga and had the vegan chocolate cake.  We were being served by Vince and he was attentive with our table. Refilling our waters often and even went back to our table and topped mine off when the pitcher ran out.   He made sure we had everything we needed like napkins, cleared our table of the dishes we finished and asking how our food was.  The loaded nachos were plentiful and the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The quesadilla was well cooked with the tortilla being soft, warm and had a somewhat crunchy, flaky texture which went well with the tender vegan chicken.  The vegan cheese by itself was tasty and the food in general was hot out of the kitchen and it was difficult waiting for it to cool down because it was so delicious!   Vince kept highly recommending the vegan chocolate cake and I'm glad we had room for dessert because it's the most delicious cake I've ever had!  The cake was moist and was a pretty big slice! The sweetness of the chocolate went well with the sweet raspberries and raspberry glaze!  We requested to speak with a manager, and Vince was worried at first, but it was to give our compliments for the excellent food and service!  When my brother had told the manager it was my birthday, he offered me a free birthday shot, if I drank alcohol I would've accepted his offer, either way I appreciated the sentiment!  I'll for sure be revisiting Nacho Daddy to try out the rest of the menu!",

I would HIGHLY recommend this place if you are looking for a good Mexican meal. Diana, our waitress, was outstanding and very friendly. This place is a hidden gem just a little ways off the strip.

I also have a tomato allergy, and they were able to accommodate (my order of the fiesta nacho) easily and accurately. They also have gluten free items marked on the menu, as well as vegan options. Really plenty of options for everyone!   The drinks were wonderful, we saw a girl at another table have a scorpion shot too! (They claim they're famous for these shots with an actual scorpion in it)   The service: our waitress was only in her third day of work, but she was still really great.

There were so many nacho options to choose from- typical \"mexican\" style choices and also more unique choices like lobster and crab. We started dinner with the chips trio - I couldn't decide if the queso or guac was better but both were delicious! Our server was a little rude throughout the night and appeared like she was out of it and not wanting to be there, but outside of her it was a fun experience. Also, we had a special perk for checking in on yelp and we got a free margarita- can't complain!",

We were told that our last dish was coming and so everyone got their food except for one and then we were told about 5 minutes later that they ran out of the dish. We ordered another dish and by the time it got to our table the rest of us had finished eating. Also, we ordered the Vegan fajitas which were BOMB except we ran out of tortillas and it took another 5-10 minutes to flag our waiter to get more. Ordered corn and got flour.   DONT FoRGET TO USE YOUR YELP CHECK IN AND GET YOUR FREE MARGARITA  Sorry Nacho Daddy. I still love you but I disliked my last experience very much.",

My brother took us to Nacho Daddy and we waited about 25 minutes before being seated on a Saturday evening. After being seated, we ordered the Fiesta Nachos, Thai Chicken Nachos (per servers rec) and the California Burrito.   I will say that the food is on the heavier side but it is VERY delicious. The fiesta is a must on the menu and the Cali burrito is supposedly a best seller. The Thai chicken nachos was recommended by our server but we thought it was a bit too sweet for our taste buds. I don't know when I'll be back in Vegas but the next time I come, I'll be revisiting Nacho Daddy.",

I enjoyed the chicken tinga nachos but the chips got gooey really quick so a few minutes in you have to eat them with a fork. Not much can be done about that and I guess I should have expected that with a queso sauce. Loved all the toppings though. Needed a little more spice.  I had the Blood Orange margarita and it was very icey and lacked much flavor or booze. I just think they added too much ice and not enough mix/booze when blending. I'd come back for the nachos another time but would try another drink.   Service was excellent and fast. We were in and out with fully bellies in 45 minutes and off to our show.  If not for the bad marg it would have been a 4 star.  $95 before tip for 4 adults.",

We were all so done with fancy dinners from our work convention so this place really hit the spot. Once inside pretty spacious and we were seated right away. The menu is your typical Mexican restaurant with some other twists. Like their name they specialize in nachos with lots of great choices and toppings. We decided to share some apps and should've just stuck with that because their chips, salsa, guacamole and queso dip are amazing. I could've easily just had a couple of beers and their chips and been good.   The dumb part of me decided to also order some filet mignon fajitas as well. These are pretty cool when they literally bring them over to you flaming with fire. It was a really cool added touch. The flavors where also very good with just the right amount ratio of meat and veggies. My coworker got these spicy chicken nachos and holy chicken there was a ton of nachos and chicken in his plate. After muscling through this everyone was in a tortilla chip , salsa and meat coma. The drinks here however a little on the weak side and a little disappointing but they made up for it with a great beer selection and we enjoyed a pitcher of IPA. Either way great spot and would highly recommend any local or visitor.",

I also got the tortilla soup and for me this was the best thing I tasted here. It was mildly spicy, warm and the chicken was tender.   Overall, the ambience is upbeat and carefully chosen music videos play on big screens while you dine. It was busy but they still got our order right and the food took less than 30 minutes from when we ordered. I will definitely come back!",

I totally get why Nacho Daddy has such high marks on Yelp. It is a decent sized place, they have happy hour, it's casual, it's affordable for solid food, the menu is quite large, they have good drinks, the service is friendly and attentive, and the vibe is cool. Having the full combo is surprising on the strip, so it makes sense that they stand out.  During CES week I went here with two friends for dinner and happy hour. We checked in on Yelp to get our free margaritas and ordered tortilla soup (excellent and filling) and quinoa bowls of different types (excellent). All throughout our meal, our server kept checking on us and the food came out quite quickly. We'd definitely come back again.",

We then saw one of the bussers and asked if we could sit anywhere. He then went to someone who we assumed was the manager and he came up to us and we were told to sit anywhere. Everything else was ok from here on out but those first 15 minutes or so were horrible. My wife also ordered the enchiladas with red and green sauce, but they came out with no sauce. We were tired and hungry so we grabbed to go boxes. We tipped our waitress and said thanks to the big guy watching the floor and left.",

We had the Filet meal mignon, lobster and crab, and fiesta nachos! FOODGASM! There's no words to describe because it was so flavorful!! Don't take my word for it, just go try it out! Don't bother trying the other usual Mexican menu items when you can have it all in the nachos!

    "text": "It's easy to dismiss nacho daddy as a tourist trap with their scorpion shots and nacho food theme. But beyond that is actually some pretty great food.  Feeling a bit frisky and you can try their awesome Thai nachos or lobster and crab nachos. Feeling healthy and you can get a salad. Gluten free and vegan options abound and are marked in the menu.  They even have a great breakfast, huevos rancheros were excellent.   Tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge, if you catch my drift.   All in all though my favorite cheap eats from my last Vegas trip.",

That being said, T'was a cold and rainly night... but seriously, this place is great with a group (as is Vegas)!  This place is in Planet Hollywood, but we came over from the Tropicana... there's a place for Uber/ Lyft/ Taxi to drop you right by the door!  While we waited for a table (just a few minutes), we got to check out the black desert scorpions in the tank by the door.  We hoped to see them eat the tiny crickets while were there, but they didn't.    We were seated, and hit YELP for our FREE MARGARITAS!  They were really decent, especially for FREE!  Our waitress was amazing, and quick with our food and drinks!  She was quick to try the upsell of the Scorpion Shot (actual scorpion on the lime), but we passed!  We started with the white queso (which is holy in our book), and it was really good!  It was thick and flavorful, and we were happy!  We decided to go family style, and try everything... and it seemed to be the best choice.  The plates are HUGE! We started with the Enchiladas nachos, and they were okay... nothing to write home about. Then came the Filet Mignon Nachos, which were killer!  Huge fan!  Then we closed out with Lobster and Crab Nachos!  Just Shut the Hell Up good!  If this can't make you happy, you can't be happy!  How do you top it all off?  Dessert Nachos!  Piles of baked apple, whipped cream, and cinnamon sugar on crispy tostadas!  Get ya some of this!  So this place also has a HUGE Vegan menu!  Apparently, they also serve stuff other than Nachos' and Liquor... but why would you want that, LOL? We will be back for Tacos, Enchiladas, and Burritos!  They also have Mexican breakfasts (chiliquilies, huevos rancheros, and breakfast burritos) and American Breakfasts (omelettes, eggs, breakfast sliders).    If you are looking for Awesomeness, or just Nacho's this is the place!  Plus, lots of stuff for your \"other friends\" as well!  5 STARS for nailing it!",

    "text": "Ooooooooooh yeeeeeeeeeeah this is the Macho Man and I'm hear to review Las Vegas's own Nacho Daddy. Diggit! Well sadly not even a legend like Randy could help me kick out from my recent experience at Nacho Daddy.  I had been eyeing this for a few trips now and finally wanted something new so I decided to give it a shot and while it was nice and all I have to say it really didn't stack up at least for me.   After tossing between their nachos or a burrito I decided on the burrito and I actually requested to have it paired with lobster just to feel fancy. For me the flavor overall just fell flat. I was disappointed that it was a mixture of lobster and crab, but the taste just did not pop out and got overshadowed with the mixture of everything. I was very disappointed. To put it blunt as possible it really wasn't a good meal, but in fairness it wasn't all a bad meal either. A credit was the red and green sauce as I did find that flavorful, but if that has to be a highlight then you know the meal was a flop.  Perhaps I just got the wrong thing as their nachos did look pretty good and they do quite the table side presentation with their fajitas. They are flaming literally because the table next to us ordered it and they seemed to duck for cover from the sizzling going on. Made me wish I had that as I was walking out.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating to our party which I always find a plus, but beyond that i just can't give it any higher or I'd be doing a disservice to what I stand for here.  Would I be back? Not willingly. Could I be back? Never say never because people who dined with me seemed to enjoy things so I see a return visit down the road either way. If you're in the mood for hit home Mexican food at least in my view this should be nacho first choice (sad to say).",

We had the lobster nachos and filet mignon. If I could do it again I wouldn't order the lobster. Too fishy but the filet mignon was properly cooked and super flavorful. The chips were super soggy because of delivery. I would recommend the restaurant next time to put the cheese sauce in a side dish so it doesn't make it soggy but the portions are huge. Definitely try it out. Super loaded",

We first took a seat at the bar. I started with ceviche which was very good. The nachos came a little later and the portion size was large, enough to satisfy the largest of appetites. All the ingredients were hot and gooey. I enjoyed everything on the nachos except the ranchero sauce. It didn't quite accompany the other flavors, but this did not stop me from indulging until everything was consumed. The atmosphere was lively and infused with energetic music. Despite the unlikable sauce, I would return to explore the other nacho options.",

And if you got the balls please do the scorpion shot :D   Let's start with the drinks, who else gives you a free margarita with a check in and be on the strip in Vegas? Nacho daddy does! My only complaint is the huge inconsistency between the drinks. Our table had 3 check-in margaritas and the drink strength had a huge difference: practically juice with a hint of tequila, a little less juice and more tequila, and a True margarita with a good amount of tequila. I was quite shocked when we tried each other's drinks but it is free so I can't really complain. If you love tequila, this is the best place for you. They have a whole page for you to choose from.   Ok next, food!!! The entree portions are huge! We shared the wings app which was a bit of a letdown, it was small and dry. So I do what all gf would do, take a bite and dump it on the bf's plate . But hey on the flip side, that chimichanga I ordered was huge and crispy and stuffed like no tomorrow. If this place was near home you would see me here pretty often and leaving with my leftovers :)",

My friends are I discovered this place after looking for places to eat on Yelp. We booked a reservation through OpenTable. I highly recommend making reservations, it looked super busy even at 9:25 at night. When we arrived they were still preparing our table but it gave us time to look around. The first thing you notice is the aquarium tank filled with bugs. They're known for the Scorpion shot which is a shot of your choosing served with a scorpion.  Back to the food. We all ordered a margarita. I got the house one free since I checked in on Yelp. And it was absolutely delicious. The perfect mix of tequila and limes. I loved that it was served in a mason jar but I'm basic like that. I ordered the queso as my entree and I'm so glad I did. The chips were warm and fresh. And the queso was served with a little tea light under it to keep it warm. Honestly I don't think it helped at all but it was a nice touch. The queso was smooth and is a White queso. It had the perfect amount of heat. It comes with a side of pick de Gallo which is also fresh and the perfect amount of heat. Overall we had a great time here and I would definitely come back in the",

We honestly sat for an extra hour just sipping and enjoying the 90s playbacks!   The margaritas are HUGE and DELICIOUS for margarita fanatics. Ask the severs for their recommendations on taste- they won't steer you wrong.   I loved the ample amount of BBQ on the BBQ Chicken Nachos. So tasty and covered in good toppings!   My husband said his Filet Mignon Burrito was the best burrito he's ever tasted in his life-- from my one bite I would definitely agree. A thick burrito with fillings and perfectly tender meat.   We agreed that we would go here every Friday if we weren't from out of town!",

I did my normal check in and got a free margarita which was cool. I opted out of the house margarita and went with the Blood Orange margarita with a sugar rim.  They took $8 off that instead.  To be honest, that poor drink didn't have a chance. Sweet orange flavor without the harsh tequila taste. For my meal, I shared the Supreme Tostada Nachos but I requested no beans. This plate was massive. Took two of us to share to finish most of it. The portion side was large. No complaints from me. Under $20 to feed two people to the point of where you want to undo that top button of your pants to relax like it was Thanksgiving says a lot about the portions. Only complaint was that due to the game (insert sports team here) on, I heard loud drunk people shouting at the TVs. Not the fault of the restaurant; plus it is Vegas after all. So I should have expected that being on the strip.",

From my seat I could see the kitchen and I noticed that the nachos were sitting there for almost 10 minutes under the heat lamp. It turns out that they were waiting for our wings to come out and they take a while. Eventually a waiter came to our table and asked if we would like to start with the nachos, even though the wings are technically the appetizer. We, of course, said yes!   I shared the Fiesta Nachos. So good. The chicken was shredded and had a lot of flavor. The chicken itself wasn't spicy in my opinion, but there were some jalapenos throughout the nacho mound. I do think that the chips got a little soggy because they were sitting out for a while, but the flavor was still good. The naked wings were also fine. I'm not a huge wings person but they've tasted good to me and came with a variety of sauces on the side.   Everyone in my party used the Yelp check in to get a free house margarita. One of the best margaritas I've ever had, and it was free!! If you love nachos and other Mexican type cuisine, check out Nacho Daddy at any hour of the day or night.",

The TV's inside the restaurant were playing mainly rap music videos which my party really enjoyed.   The food was amazing. We ordered the bottomless chips and salsa and didnt have to wait too long to get refills on chips. We also got the trio sampler which came with some of the best queso I've ever eaten. One of my friends ordered the nachos to share and my mind was blown by how huge the nachos were. They definitely don't skimp out on the food here.   Overall the service was about average. Towards the end of our stay our waiter got busy and didn't visit us as often and we had to try and find her to get our checks.

The staff was so friendly and attentive too. I'm so glad we tired this spot out! It does not disappoint!",

I got the filet nacho and they are good amazing!! Fajita is another must try. Get the for two versions.  I don think it",

She took an unusually long amount of time to come to our table when we were seated. In fact, the host actually walked over and interrupted her story time she was having with another server to remind her that she now has a table.   The service after that was decent UNTIL she brought the bill. We put our card in and she walked past 3 different times without grabbing it. After the 3rd time, she was across the way, chatting with another server for at least 7 or so minutes. We tried to make eye contact, get her attention and nothing worked. Finally, her manager walked up and nudged her to come over. My boyfriend mouthed \"thank you\" to the manager and he replied with a \"you're welcome.\"   To the waitress, I am sorry that our business took away from your gossip time. We seriously felt like we were invisible.",

I don't like walking off Las Vegas Blvd. but this is a mere 1/4 of a block off the beaten path.  I am giving this place 5 stars for several reasons. Taylor, the server, was warm and professional.   The namesake nachos are delicious and can be shared as an appetizer by 4 people. We got the filet mignon nachos but I really wanted to try the buffalo chicken.  The chicken fajitas for two ($23) is a very large portions of white meat chicken, peppers, onions, wraps, rice, beans, guac, sour cream, lettuce, pickled onions and salsa. It's a lot of food but don't worry, we gave it a good home.  Free House Margarita with Yelp check in but we didn't partake of the deal because no one at the liked margaritas.",

I had the grilled lobster tacos which were very good, soft corn tortillas and a good mango salsa. I also ordered a side of black beans instead of refried, and they were good. Hubby had a pollo burrito, solid choice, and it came wet(but not very). The other two in our group had a Carne Asada burrito and enchiladas. Both enjoyed their dinners as well.  Today we went back to try breakfast. I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage. It definitely is big(I only ate 1/2), but here's the thing....it was okay....but not one of my top ten. So, in my humble opinion, and being a native Cali, this was pretty plain, and had a fair amount of grease dripping out. The contents were hash browns, scrambled eggs, cheese put on top and then it appeared that the sausage were patties that had been weirdly chopped and put on top of the hash brown/egg/cheese. It almost looked layered. No pico, no crema, no guac or avocado.....just plain. I literally was dumping the salsa(that came on the side), and Cholula to get some moisture/flavor. Hubby had the steak omelette and really liked it.   We probably would return, but I feel like you need to know what to order, as not everything is a standout. But I do think they are known for their nachos(hence the name, lol), and we did see a lot of them being served around us.  In the end it's not going to beat any of our favorite Taqueria's in Nor Cal, or the Central Coast, but the food here is fresh, and the service is great.  I don't want to forget....we did enjoy two pitchers of margaritas with dinner, Patron Anejo, on the rocks. Not cheap on the pours, and tasty!",

This location is great!  Technically, it's located on Harmon Ave., right across from the Harley Davison casino, but you need to access the restaurant by going to the Planet Hollywood resort. And when you do, you won't be disappointed.   The grilled shrimp appetizer is tasty, the filet mignon nachos are great, and the margaritas are awesome! The service is amazing, too! Our waitress, Serena, and the general manager, Mikey, were very friendly and very attentive. I have only good things to say about the new Nacho Daddy location at Planet Hollywood.",

We started with a pitcher of white peach margaritas...Yum They were stiff strong and delicious!  We all ordered different dishes and got to taste each other's food...   All the food was on point. We ordered a Lobster crab nacho ...WOW! A spicy shrimp nacho, yummy! A vegan spicy burrito, it was good, woulda been better w salsa, but our waitress disappeared... we wanted to order an appetizer of jackfruit tacos, they were sold out... They must be good if they are sold out before 5pm on a Monday... Return visit is planned to try them. Instead we got fried avocado tacos,  Omg they were amazing! The one meat eater in the group ordered Filet mignon nachos and loved them! All the flavor profiles were delicious even the vegan ones. Would have given 5 stars cuz I really liked it, but our waitress who started off great. Disappeared, we tried to get change at the bar and he said NO! I still don't want that to negatively affect a really fun good meal. Plus our food coma's didn't last that long lol! I would recommend them and tell you that you can park at the miracle mile mall or get dropped off there and walk thru the REALLY cool miracle mile either before or after \"NACHO DADDY\"",

By the time I got my food, it was cold already. I was expecting the portion to be bigger for the price. Enchilada was so small and barely taste the lobster or crab, overall the taste was flat. I was really disappointed. I tried the fish tacos, and it was the same. I barely taste the fish, it was overshadowed by all the salsa.

You can guarantee that I will be back, even as a local resident in Vegas. Had a really great experience! It is easy to leave a negative review, but the positive ones are harder to come by. Just wanted to share my experience in the hopes it helps others.",

A quick check in prompted a free drink with the purchase with an appetizer which was a great start. Very Friendly, attentive service made us feel extremely welcome. Now to the reason we were there. NACHOS! who doesn't like nachos? Especially from a place that is named after them! So we gave their giant menu a long look and of course ended up getting one of their Nacho Options. I couldn't believe how many Nacho options they had! We went with the Pulled Pork Nachos and Knew we had made the right decision when they were set in front of us. I don't think we had a single chip that was left without toppings! Not to mention the serving size was more than enough or two people. Two drinks and a meal for $30 in Vegas is unheard of. We will absolutely return and try something new. The group we went with was sick of hearing about how much we loved this place. If you are on the fence at all, i hope this review pushes you to try this wonderful restaurant. If you have even close to as good of an experience as we had then I am convinced you will be thrilled with your decision.",

The portion size is generous and can be easily split between two. I like the fact that the nachos were filling without leaving you feeling like you ate a bowl of greasy cheese. We also ordered a kale salad which was fresh and offered a nice balance to the hearty nachos.   The place was spacious and had a fun but low key vibe. I also loved the music videos from the early 2000s that were playing in the background!  Overall, I had a experience. The prices are reasonable, food was delicious (no, I wasn't drunk), and the service was friendly. I would definitely come back.  Also, don't forget to check in on yelp for a free house margarita!",

The margaritas are the best we have had and you can't beat happy hour with $5 appetizers and house margaritas. We have tried most of the menu and have no complaints. The atmosphere is fun and the bartenders are AMAZING. So, friendly and offer great service, our personal favorites are SCARLET and SHANNON, they always take great care of us and are such hard workers. Scarlet can multitask like nobody else:) A new bartender started Thursday night, I don't remember her name, but she was super sweet. The next two nights we watched her comfort level grow and by Saturday night she fit right in with the Nacho Daddy family. We hope to see her there on our next trip. We highly recommend Nacho Daddy to everyone we know and highly recommend Nacho Daddy to everyone reading these Yelp reviews.",

We came here a little later in the night and it didn't seem super busy but it still took a very long time for our food to come out, even the appetizer. However, our server was kind enough to stop by in between and brought us some chips and salsa to snack on while we waited so that made up for it. Would definitely recommend stopping here if you're in the mood for some tacos or a burrito! The house margarita was also a hit!",

What a score...The micheladas were really good and they can make them spicy if you prefer (A real nice kick to them). They were too big and we took them to go.  The burritos were very good, and filling. We got the breakfast burrito with sausage and the burrito with filet mignon. Recommend both. A table of 4 beside us ordered nachos and the size of them were so big the table couldn't finish it.  If you get the nachos maybe share between 2-3 people. The servers were all very friendly and welcoming.  Will make this a must-stop for our next Vegas trip.",

The hostess who sat us put us in the corner so we were out of sight, out of mind. It took us nearly 15 minutes before the waitress even came out to take our drink order. After that, everything we got just took longer and longer for her to return. I thought this was going to be another 2-3 star Vegas joint until the food came.  I got the BBQ pork nachos. They were OFF THE CHAIN. PLENTY of nachos! Great tasting BBQ sauce. Pork was perfectly tender and covering all of the nachos as they claim. The cheese hit it all off wonderfully. I got a pomegranate margarita; it tasted great and was very potent, loved it.  My wife and I split a fried ice cream dessert. It was certainly ON POINT. The ice cream was really good, accompanied by the perfect crunch of the \"fried\" shell and the nachos and the drizzled syrup makes it very tasty. Awesome place overall; wish there was one in Chicago! If they can improve their service, it would be a 5-star hit every time!",

When Zach delivered our small child's meal, we had a question about the temperature of the skillet it was on. He grabbed the handle to show us it was a cool plate, which we greatly appreciated. Then chef Reuben stopped by on his way out and we were able to express to him how much we enjoyed the meal and that the vegan Chickn Tacos (and our daughter's meals with meat) were yummy. The Vegan Chickn Tacos were on the spicy side, which we enjoyed, but you should be aware of it if sensitive. To top it off, we were able to speak to the manager, Brian, to express our appreciation for his staff. Everyone was amazingly friendly and attentive, which we were particularly grateful for after a long day of driving with kids.",

Brian made sure the place was perfect with lighting and flowers for the table that coordinated with the wedding colors. Because we were from out of town, Brian was so helpful by personally having a wedding cake made by a local bakery, and it was absolutely perfect. The food was so good! The service was beyond our expectations in every way. Thank you for making the Brooks wedding party so memorable!",

We sat at the bar and our bartender couldn't have been better... she was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and very personable & friendly.  We didn't want to leave!  Beyond that, we fell in love with their food so much, I emailed the company when I got home asking if they'd surprise my wife with some of their salsa, and sure enough they were happy to do so (Thanks again Taylor)!  If you're looking for great Mexican food while on the Vegas strip at a great value, Nacho Daddy is the place!",

We tried the BBQ Chicken nachos and ordered 6 naked BBQ wings, which were also great! The wings had a spicy dry rub and came with the BBQ sauce on the side.  The nachos were piled high with pulled chicken, although they had a bit too much BBQ sauce for my opinion and could have used a bit more salsa and cilantro.  Happy hour was also starting and we couldn't pass up $4 draft Mexican beer.  Just off the main Las Vegas Strip with outdoor seating in the Miracle Mile shops its a nice place to grab a quick eat!",

    "text": "I absolutely have to give this place five stars, no doubt about it.  Prior to EDC, I made a post on reddit asking for recommendations on late-night eats, based on where I was staying. A number of people recommended this place because it was directly across from where I was staying (Marriott Grand Chateau).  Other than EDC, I planned my trip around eating. My flight was supposed to get in around close to midnight, which means I'd have sufficient time to drop off my bags and go to Tacos El Gordo, but unfortunately, my flight got delayed!!! So by the time I got to my hotel, it was too late :'( luckily, Nacho Daddy was still an option and we walked across the street for some nomsss.   That night, we ordered the triple dip appetizer and the filet mignon nacho to share between the five of us. It was enough for me to get full and for the others' midnight snack. THE QUESO IS SO BOMBBB. no idea what kind of cheese it is but I highly recommend it. The filet mignon nachos on the other hand, literally cannot go wrong. We inhaled it.  So anyway, this place was so good...that we came here Saturday morning with our party of 9, of course, no shame. We ordered the triple dip appetizer and three orders of nachos: filet mignon, lobster and crab, supreme tostada. Again, I think the filet mignon was the favorite of the three.   Our servers were generally attentive, but I think the most important part of dining during EDC weekend is keeping us fed, so they did their jobs. I'm definitely coming back if I'm in the area.",

I got the Street Tacos of the starters plate and although tasty, they weren't anything to rave about, my husband who ordered the same meal (because we weren't hungry enough for the rice and beans that came with the street taco meal) felt the same way. My brothers burrito was cold. I also think any Mexican-style restaurant (especially with a higher price-point menu) should offer complimentary chips and salsa.   Our service was kind and friendly but the highlight of the meal was the real of early 2000s music videos they played behind us.",

I for one in my vegan existence had trouble deciding on food Bc I had SO many options. I eventually settled on the original nachos Bc it is the name of the restaurant after all, to which I added the fake chicken as well.   The nachos came piled high with everything I love in life. Creamy vegan queso, vegan sour cream, black beans, jalapenos, Pico, guac etc. It was SOOOOOOO delicious. I was amazed. But then I notice not only do they have a dozen or more entrees but they ALSO have vegan dessert. A BEAUTIFUL layered chocolate cake with a rasberry glaze. It was unbelievably perfect. Get this cake to go and eat it in bed while doing a face mask and you'll sweat you have died and gone to vegan heaven.  But the kicker on this whole place is they ACTUALLY had outstanding service as well. Now I am a realistic person . I don't go to Las Vegas city of drunk out of Towners and expect overly great service from anyone. So to go somewhere where I had more vegan options than I knew what to do with AND get great service??? Well that was the unexpected icing on the cake!!! Ohhhh that delicious cake   My servers name was Brandon (booker) and he was a genuinely nice person with excellent customer service. I'll definitely be going back here to try more from their vegan menu before I head home. And to get more cake",

We inquired, and the chips came out, but the last drink didn't. It took another reminder, after we were almost finished with our meal, to finally get the last drink.  Their nachos are very good, and so are the margaritas. I preferred the Daddy's margarita, which was more balanced, over the house margarita, which was too sweet.",

I was searching online for some of the best reviewed restaurants and this one came up so we decided to go check it out and it was one of the best decisions we ever made, first of all our waitress was very nice and extremely helpful. When I was there I had ordered from their breakfast menu since they serve it all day (+extra brownie points) and had the enchiladas with scrambled egg.. it had a side of pico de gallo, guacamole & beans & my father had ordered the supreme nachos which were quite the big order as well and to top things off we both received a complementary margarita drink each. Everything was just excellent, customer service great, food great, environment overall great and at the end of the day I left a very satisfied customer and you bet next time I'm around town I'll be making sure to go back and eat from this place once again!",

The pitcher poured like 2 drinks maybe... so if you want average nachos and ripoff drinks, then I guess it's fine. There's simply better places to go, but most of Las Vegas is designed to rip you off. I mean, it's the gambling capitol of the world, so I guess by Vegas standards this place deserves the 4 stars or so it has, but otherwise it's a 2. Would be 3 if the prices were more reasonable. Then a 4 if the food was actually better than average.",

The poor girl could not keep up with everyone, especially during happy hour. She was constantly apologizing to every table as she was not able to service everyone in a timely manner. Also, there wasn't really anyone sitting at the bar but for some reason drinks ordered by tables took FOREVER to be made & delivered.  I feel as if the restaurant would have bee staffed better or had the support of management it would have been a much smoother & enjoyable experience.",

Maybe it's just this location because since then we've gone to the other locations where the vegan chicken burrito was actually vegan chicken  lesson learned will never go here for vegan menu!

I usually choose this location because of the great service, however I am sad to say this location has lost it. I will not be coming back. From the moment I walked in I was not greeted by the hostess, rather nonchalantly glanced at and told it would be \"35 minutes for two.\" I let her know that we actually had all four people standing with me in our party. Once we finally got to the table the waitress seemed overwhelmed and rushed. Horrible customer service. Someone in our party asked for plain nachos with just cheese. The waitress said that they could not do that. She didn't offer any solutions or accommodations. How hard is it to put cheese on chips? This place is called Nacho Daddy. Throughout our meal (Salina, our waitress) was inattentive and hard to reach. We ordered a beer that did not come until after another drink was ordered almost 15 minutes later.   From now on I will be visiting/ recommending the Summerlin location.",

We had trouble finding this place after thinking it was in one of the malls (it's not...walk on the streets to easily get to it).  We arrived around prime dinner time and the wait wasn't long at all (20 min or so). The BEST part is if you check in on Yelp, you get a free house margarita so my fiance and I both got one!! You will have to order an entree for every free margarita you receive just FYI. We ordered the BBQ chicken nachos, pork tacos and beer battered lobster tacos. Everything was so good but the BBQ chicken nachos were AMAZING!! I mean...the word nacho is in their name so one would assume that they have the best nachos!",

It is always hard to find somewhere my husband and I can both eat, I was happy to see we found a place surrounded by nachos that we both can enjoy.  To start we checked in to unlock the free house margarita since we both knew we would be ordering an entree. I've read a few things stating how the marg was soooo good, but honestly it didn't do it for me. Too sour, either they don't make their own sours and it was the awful bottled kind or it just had too much. The first sip was also, warmish. So I'm assuming the bartender didn't shake it and just dumped all of the ingredients into the cup then added ice. Either way, I couldn't drink it, I'm happy it was free because I would have sent it back.  To eat -- I had the vegan nachos, which were honestly amazing. They were served nice and warm. Filled with black beans, salsas, guac, jalapenos, v sour cream and their v cheese. I'm some times not the biggest fan of the vegan cheeses but it was so tasty!  My husband had the buffalo chicken nachos. He cleared his skillet with no problem, they were delish! He said they were pretty dang spicy and he loved it. I appreciated the fact they add pieces of celery to help with the heat.  Our service at the bar was pretty slow and I felt like we kept being forgotten. Even when I asked for recommendations on the vegan menu, our bartender had nothing to offer to help me decided. She seemed less than interested in being there, but hey the food totally made up for it!",

The nachos had a great slightly Smokey flavor and the chicken was very moist and fresh. The pickled reds were a nice touch. My surf and turf tacos were pretty good too the surf taco is fried lobster and the turf taco is filet Mingnon. The thing that really made the tacos good were tortilla. Soft yet flaky and strong enough to hold the taco together. Only knocks on this place is that it's a bit on the pricey side for nachos and not the easiest to find if you are a tourist.",

I got the vegan nachos and thought they were pretty darn good, and might be able to fool someone into thinking they weren't vegan! The portion size was huge, too, so I brought some back to the hotel with me in a box. I'm also a fan of the free margarita with yelp check in! The ambiance was pretty relaxed with music videos playing on the screen and blasting over the speakers.   My only con is that these nachos really upset my stomach. I'm not sure if it was too much grease, or artificial ingredients, or what, but the rest of the day I had pretty bad stomach cramps and it kind of put a damper on things. For that reason, I don't think I'll be back, I don't want to risk that happening again. :(",

But wait before I dive in to the shabbiness of the food I ordered, I wanted to mention that the waitress was super nice and very friendly, and I did tip her 20% of the total amount.   Okay back to the food. So I ordered chips and salsa(medium) while waiting for the main order to arrive. The chips and salsa were mediocre. Nothing great about it. I mean cmon you have more than 1000 reviews and more than 4 stars, you can definitely do better. Anyways, comes the main order. So you would expect a Mexican restaurant (with a rating like this on yelp) to have the best of the best tacos, right ?! I mean how can you mess the one thing you are supposed to be good at!  So I ordered three street tacos: 2 chicken and 1 pork.  The moment the waitress put the plate on the table, I knew it's going to be an ordeal to eat all of them seeing what they looked like. So I took the first bite of the pork tacos and yuck! I was about to throw up. There was no taste in the meat or whatever sauce it carried. I didn't even dare to take second bite of that taco. It was just disgusting. Now comes the time for chicken tacos. I mean how can you mess the chicken, right ?! They were pulled chicken tacos. And had no taste. Plus when you took a bite it felt like chewing rubber. Utterly nasty!  Anyways, I am not even close to being impressed by this place. And if you want to eat nice \"tasty\" food, I suggest you go somewhere else. I can bet chipotle has better food.",

My BF had a giant Fat Tuesday with him when we walked in and they put it in the walk in freezer for him. They know whats up. I basically ate all of the nachos because Mr. Tuesday over here was filled up on sugar and alcohol. My tummy did a rumbling after but for some reason a heavy meal in 90 degrees Las Vegas was exactly what I needed to rally for the night. I didn't even end up eating dinner that day because the nachos held me over until morning. Tons of options for nachos and weird music videos playing. Good service and big portions.

    "text": "Nacho Daddy does well what it claims to be good at, nachos, but lacks in other areas. I was here on a saturday afternoon, and the food and service was subpar, specially for vegas. Even though it says Miracle Mile shops, the restaurant is located on an ave slightly off the strip which confused us while we were looking for it.  The restaurant is pretty large. As you enter, they have a small waiting area with a scorpion tank, very funky. There is a large bar, a dining area, and a small patio section with 4-5 tables which is cool for people watching. The decor is decent but not special, but the ambiance was pretty dingy in the inside dining area, and not very clean. There were also pigeons flying in trying to snag scraps to eat, which was very weird.  For the food and drinks, the nachos were excellent. We got two different types of nachos, and those were made to perfection. However, the other entrees weren't as good. My burrito was very dry and lacked flavor, and the quesadilla was burnt. Some of the other entrees my friends got were nice, like the fajitas and sandwiches. The drinks were really great too. We tried a pitcher of their orange margarita which was very well made. The spicy cucumber margarita packed a kick, but was refreshing. A commendable thing here is the availability of a vegan menu, which I've hardly seen in vegas.  The service however, was really slow. There was only one server for the entire section who was overwhelmed. She was very friendly and trying her best to keep up with the crowds, but it took her a long time to get to each table. The food took a really long time to get to us as well. Prices here are really competitive, and very inexpensive for the quantity of food. Entrees are around $12-15 unlike the main strip restaurants.  This is a strong 3.5* restaurant with decent prices and food. It's not a glamorous restaurant on the strip, but I will recommend this place for a filling meal, and specially for vegans.",

He can't consume any dairy which we were very clear about when ordering but his burger accidentally came with cheese.  Honest mistake -- happens all the time actually.  They immediately took it back and began preparing a new burger, and the chef came to our table a couple times to apologize which, while certainly not necessary, was very kind.   I promised to remember his name but darnit I've forgotten.  I know it had 5 letters and might be Javen or Romen or something -- sorry! We would have happily returned here during our trip if only our hotel had been closer.  I look forward to returning on a future trip and trying more of the vegan options.  ***Edit: Chef's name is Ruben. Thanks for the follow-up email, Manager Taylor!",

Even though it was totally enough food for three people (who also had two tasty margaritas each), I kinda wish I had more to myself because they were that amazing.",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible. I literally took time out of my march madness betting and game watching to review this place. First of all, the name says it all it's NOT YO DADDY (and not yo daddy's nacho). I'm almost 100% positive that anyone that likes this place is 1 of 3 things. 1. Drunk and sunburnt on the brain. 2. A person who literally has never been to a movie theater (and had waaayyy better nachos for half the price). 3. Someone who doesn't even know hat nachos are supposed to be. Heck, try Cheesecake Factory appetizer nachos (those are actually really good and Cheaper), try Taco Bell nachos, or the nachos from del taco, you'll have a better result. Instead of putting your soggy Costco chips covered with dry flavorless chicken and NO toppings (e.g. Sour cream, salsa, etc.), why don't you just close your business and sell it to Starbucks so it can benefit us (and yes I know there is a Starbucks already right around the corner in the Elara lobby). Worst nachos ever. And why put nachos in a cardboard pizza box for \"to go\" purposes? They must not have tested that. Try walking to your room in PH, Elara, or Grand Chateau with these things and see how warm they are. Oh nice touch to have the cardboard stuck to the melted cheese... FYI if it's not in-n-out, I don't want cheese paper or any other type of container stuck to my food.  I will say this. After 10+ hours of reflection, I have some additions. Their management (Taylor) is very profesional and seems to genuinely care about the business doing a proper job. So credit (and the 1 forced star that Yelp demands) goes to her and her staff. If the food prep staff was as professional, perhaps my review would have been a bit different. Nevertheless the Decor in the establishment is nice and appropriate for what they must be paying for a rental space in a center strip view Vegas hotel. Although I wouldn't recommend it, it seems that most people seem happy with it, so gl NYD!",

Triple dip chip with melted queso cheese was something I've never had anywhere and it was great.  Went to Vegas for my wife's birthday so I asked if there was anything my birthday girl could have.  We chose a free churrro sundae and our server Taylor B treated us great!   Other servers were also very friendly and helped when we needed to cancel a menu item because their generous portions led us to know we couldn't eat everything we initially ordered.  Great food, service, and atmosphere. What else can you want for great food in Vegas without having so spend a ton of money!",

They have a menu full of all sorts of nachos that you wouldn't even think of in your dreams. We had the house special since it was our first time in and we polished our plate clean they were so good!! I will for sure be returning to try another nacho creation the next time I am in Las Vegas!",

Ari was our waitress and she was great. She was friendly and helpful. She even sang (happy birthday song) along with my family. For this act put her over the top, and earned herself a $20 tip. The atmosphere was good and they played music for most types, with the video to go along with it which is rare. Chips and salsa were good. First place I've been where they bring three versions (mild, medium, hot) of their salsa. We had variety of food and breakfast included which was even good. I would recommend to at least try once. Although none of us tried their nachos, I would rather go back and watch a sports game and try some. They were huge from what I seen! Not sure if this chain has any located in any casinos, but they would make a killing if they did! Also must say this is the first restaurant I've seen with a aquarium that has live crickets (bait) for the black scorpions that were lounging in there. Only gave 4 star rating since I haven't tried the nachos. But will be back soon enough.",

Scorpion shots are always available, add a little desert creature to any shot.   Well, things have changed. We sat up at the bar and two servers started discussing their customers in front of us. They were bagging on them. They said their customers were difficult and rude. Ok, please don't discuss that in front of us. It just brings the whole mood down. It wasn't even our bartender.  Arnold was nice.   Service was just ok this time compared to excellent before. Bryce was tending bar one night. He's fun and knows his craft but he's gone. The margaritas were excellent.   Food: most nachos are delicious and generously portioned. The Sloppy Joe, once called Sloppy Jose, nachos are a tasty mountain of beef, white queso, cheddar, and tomatoes. Buffalo, spicy shrimp, Thai chicken, and BBQ pork are all tasty. The homeless in the area must be well fed because the portions are sizable and this is the Vegas strip, don't want to be toting a box of leftovers around. Chicarrones, street tacos, ceviche, and naked grilled wings were on point.   Downtown and this location are changing and not for the better. I hope things get better because the food is good. The service however is not improving. You won't regret it.",

Hostess said our waiter PJ would be over shortly, we waited a little over 6 minutes before a gentleman came over commenting he's noticed we've been waiting a while for our waiter, could he get us started on drinks. I was very grateful for his attempt, commenting that we had just discussed leaving due to not getting waited on until he stopped by. We already had our menu so we knew what ones we wanted. Went with two Margaritas and two glasses of water. PJ actually was the one who brought our drinks to us, explaining it was a busy night, trying to make small talk. My boyfriend had counted during our wait, it was less than 17 tables and more than enough staff that at the most he'd have 3 to 4 tables...so, no excuse! Sure, could have been busy at your dinner rush but we came in shortly after 8:00pm, not a full house, we don't need excuses. Took our food order and we waited, and waited. The kind server who took our drink order must have mentioned something to the manager because he walked by saying \"is everything ok now that we have our food?\". That was kind of innaproapate, either stop before this and visit, or know you rectified the situation by speaking with your employee behind the scene. When PJ brought the food he commented that he'd be checking in a lot, giving us all his attention, that we'd probably get sick of him. He was nice, this is probably his first serving job, just relax and it'll be ok! We saw him the traditional one stop before the check.  We've both been in the restaurant industry, boyfriend a chef and I used to be a server, once you find your Niche you're golden...I hope it's soon for him. He just needs confidence, he's got the rest down. Tasty dishes, ok drinks, they seem to have a lot of acid, friendly staff.",

    "text": "This place has a lot going for it. Who wouldn't want to eat dinner at a place called nacho daddy? That's the first thing that pulled me in. We made reservations for 5:30 on a Tuesday night which was probably pretty wise. If you check in on yelp you can get yourself 1 free house margarita which didn't slack on the tequila. My boss and friend both ordered off the nacho menu. I went with the Baja seafood combo. The combo was 1 crab/lobster enchilada and 1 fish taco. The taco shell was by far my favorite. It was homemade and super flakey unlike any other taco shell I have ever had. The fish on the taco was also such a nice size. The rice wasn't dry and that's super important! Overall, I was very pleased with this dish and would recommend it to anyone that doesn't want nachos. My friend is a nacho queen and she raved about these nachos. They come piled high and like they say on the menu not a chip is dry. That's how nachos should be. I loved nacho daddy and think everyone needs to make a visit here.",

We stopped for a late lunch but it definitely seemed like a great place to grab a drink and appetizers with a group. Our server was Korine and she was upbeat, attentive, and engaging. Ironically, we didn't order a signature nacho dish. My wife had what she described as a great Margarita. We also tried grilled wings, shrimp street tacos, and the standard nachos. All our food was well seasoned, and had good portions. My only issue here is that the apps were the same price as the entrees so that is always tricky deciding how much to spend etc. overall good spot.",

    "text": "WHAT?! What is this magical place? Why has no one told me sooner? This world where everyone's favorite food group (that's right, FOOD GROUP) is not only featured, but the focus of their menu. How awesome is that? Could it get more awesome? Yes it could (if they put one in Reno) being in Vegas is pretty amazing!   Located right outside The Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood it is pretty convenient, especially if you're in the shopping or Nacho mood. Patio seating with an aircraft hangar style door, also a great centrally located industrial concrete bar, and warm sunlight (in case it happens to be a cold day, as it was for us).   Because we seemingly don't know how to settle for a stock off the menu selection we went with the Supreme Tostada Nacho, but asked for the pico on the side and also a side of the enchilada sauce, but without the lettuce (cause that did seem weird, right?). First, how awesome was the bartender? They brought out our order and he immediately noticed the presence of lettuce and threw up the stop sign. All apologies, it was returned to the kitchen and a fresh prepped replacement was brought shortly thereafter. Second, these were the best nachos ever!!!! Ermergosh! Such a great blend of flavors and I was halfway through the order, before I remembered we had the sides. Unfortunately, I had waited so long that the enchilada sauce had cooled before I got to it, because I'm sure warmer would have been better (still pretty good).   I digress, let me finish this thing. Aside from amazing nachos, the bar hosts plenty of tequila (as they should), some decent beer (some local), and a friendly, smiling, engaging, conversational, smart, fun staff. Who wouldn't want to be here, eat here, roll around in a pool of nachos here? I'll never return to Vegas, without visiting here!",

It didn't come with extra beans so I asked for extra beans again and by the time I got the bill I was charged twice for extra beans.  Also my strawberry margarita had no alcohol in it.  I know everybody says drinks are watered down or whatever but legitimately there was no alcohol in my margarita or my friends margarita. They were both pure syrups and sugar.

The ambiance was fun and upbeat but it didn't hide the fact that the flavors were one dimensional and lacked soul. We got the filet nachos hoping it would be packed with juicy bites. While the steak was cooked well, the rest of the ingredients were very blah.",

If you have one of the many coupons floating around or the \"check-in\" drink special, make sure it's taken off your bill. Remember to tip on amount before discount.",

Thanks to yelp, I got a free margarita which came in a mason jar and was solid. We ordered the Golden Knights nachos which easily fed my wife and me. They came out quickly too. For each purchase of that entree $1 is donated to charity. The fried ice cream with chocolate and raspberry sauces for dessert was tasty. All in all, a good start to our time in Vegas!",

Very nice atmosphere with a cool tank filled with scorpions and crickets. We really enjoyed the nachos and the margarita's were strong and on point!
